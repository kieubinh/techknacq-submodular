        "For the featured translation task of the Sixth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, we developed a system for translating Haitian Creole Emergency SMS messages.",
        "Given the nature of the task, translating text messages that were sent during the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti to an emergency response service called Mission 4636, we were not only faced with the problem of dealing with a low-density language, but additionally, with noisy, real-world data in a domain which has thus far received relatively little attention in statistical machine translation.",
        "We were especially interested in this task because of the unique set of challenges that it poses for existing translation systems.",
        "We focused our research effort on techniques to better utilize the limited available training resources, as well as ways in which we could automatically alleviate and transform the noisy data to our advantage through the use of automatic punctuation prediction, finite-state raw-to-clean transduction, and grammar extraction.",
        "All these techniques contributed to improving translation quality as measured by b le u score over our baseline system.",
        "The rest of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "First, we provide a brief overview of our baseline system in Section 2, followed by an examination of issues posed by this task and the steps we have taken to address them in Section 3, and finally we conclude with experimental results and additional analysis."

      "heading": "2. System Overview",
      "text": [
        "Our baseline system is based on a hierarchical phrase-based translation model, which can formally be described as a synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG) (Chiang, 2007).",
        "Our system is implemented in cdec, an open source framework for aligning, training, and decoding with a number of different translation models, including SCFGs.",
        "(Dyer et al., 2010).",
        "SCFG grammars contain pairs of CFG rules with aligned nonterminals, where by introducing these nonterminals into the grammar, such a system is able to utilize both word and phrase level reordering to capture the hierarchical structure of language.",
        "SCFG translation models have been shown to produce state-of-the-art translation for most language pairs, as they are capable of both exploiting lexical information for and efficiently computing all possible reorderings using a CKY-based decoder (Dyer et al., 2009).",
        "One benefit of cdec is the flexibility allowed with regard to the input format, as it expects either a string, lattice, or context-free forest, and subsequently generates a hypergraph representing the full translation forest without any pruning.",
        "This forest can now be rescored, by intersecting it with a language model for instance, to obtain output translations.",
        "These capabilities of cdec allow us to perform the experiments described below, which may have otherwise proven to be quite impractical to carry out in another system.",
        "The set of features used in our model were the rule translation relative frequency P(e|f ), a target n-gram language model P (e), lexical translation probabilities P1ex(e|f ) and P1ex(f a count of the total number of rules used, a target word penalty, and a count of the number of times the glue rule is used.",
        "The number of non-terminals allowed in a synchronous grammar rule was restricted to two, and the non-terminal span limit was 12 for non-glue grammars.",
        "The hierarchical phrase-based translation grammar was extracted using a suffix array rule extractor (Lopez, 2007).",
        "To optimize the feature weights for our model, we used an implementation of the hypergraph minimum error rate training (MERT) algorithm (Dyer et al., 2010; Och, 2003) for training with an arbitrary loss function.",
        "The error function we used was bleu (Pa-pineni et al., 2002), and the decoder was configured to use cube pruning (Huang and Chiang, 2007) with a limit of 100 candidates at each node.",
        "The SMS messages were originally translated by English speaking volunteers for the purpose of providing first responders with information and locations requiring their assistance.",
        "As such, in order to create a suitable parallel training corpus from which to extract a translation grammar, a number of steps had to be taken in addition to lowercasing and tokenizing both sides of training data.",
        "Many of the English translations had additional notes sections that were added by the translator to the messages with either personal notes or further informative remarks.",
        "As these sections do not correspond to any text on the source side, and would therefore degrade the alignment process, these had to be identified and removed.",
        "Furthermore, the anonymization of the data resulted in tokens such as firstname and phonenum-ber which were prevalent and had to be preserved as they were.",
        "Since the total amount of Haitian-English parallel data provided is quite limited, we found additional data and augmented the available set with data gathered by the CrisisCommons group and made it available to other WMT participants.",
        "The combined training corpus from which we extracted our grammar consisted of 123,609 sentence pairs, which was then filtered for length and aligned using the GIZA++ implementation of IBM Model 4 (Och and Ney, 2003) to obtain one-to-many alignments in either direction and symmetrized using the grow-diag-final-and method (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "We trained a 5-gram language model using the SRI language modeling toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) from the English monolingual News Commentary and News Crawl language modeling training data provided for the shared task and the English portion of the parallel data with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Chen and Goodman, 1996).",
        "We have previously found that since the beginnings and ends of sentences often display unique characteristics that are not easily captured within the context of the model, explicitly annotating beginning and end of sentence markers as part of our translation process leads to significantly improved performance (Dyer et al., 2009).",
        "A further difficulty of the task stems from the fact that there are two versions of the SMS test set, a raw version, which contains the original messages, and a clean version which was post-edited by humans.",
        "As the evaluation of the task will consist of translating these two versions of the test set, our baseline system consisted of two systems, one built on the clean data using the 900 sentences in SMS dev clean to tune our feature weights, and evaluated using SMS devtest clean, and one built analogously for the raw data tuned on the 900 sentences in SMS dev raw and evaluated on SMS devtest raw.",
        "We report results on these sets as well as the 1274 sentences in the SMS test set."

      "heading": "3. Experimental Variation",
      "text": [
        "The results produced by the baseline systems are presented in Table 1.",
        "As can be seen, the clean version performs on par with the French-English translation quality in the 2011 WMT shared translation task, and significantly outperforms the raw version, despite the content of the messages being identical.",
        "This serves to underscore the importance of proper post-processing of the raw data in order to attempt to close the performance gap between the two versions.",
        "Through analysis of the raw and clean data we identified several factors which we believe greatly contribute to the difference in translation output.",
        "We examine punctuation in Section 3.2, grammar postprocessing in Section 3.3, and morphological differences in Sections 3.4 and 3.5.",
        "A practical technique when working with a low-density language with limited resources is to duplicate the same trusted resource multiple times in the parallel training corpus in order for the translation probabilities of the duplicated items to be augmented.",
        "For instance, if we have confidence in the entries of the glossary and dictionary, we can duplicate them 10 times in our training data to increase the associated probabilities.",
        "The aim of this strategy is to take advantage of the limited resources and exploit the reliable ones.",
        "However, what happens if some resources are more reliable than others?",
        "Looking at the provided resources, we saw that in the Haitisurf dictionary, the entry for paske is matched with for, while in glossary-all-fix, paske is matched with because.",
        "If we then consider the training data, we see that in most cases, paske is in fact translated as because.",
        "Motivated by this type of phenomenon, we employed an alternative strategy to simple duplication which allows us to further exploit our prior knowledge.",
        "First, we take the previously word-aligned baseline training corpus and for each sentence pair and word e% compute the alignment link count c(e%, fj) over the positions j that ej is aligned with, repeating for c(fi,ej) in the other direction.",
        "Then, we process each resource we are considering duplicating, and augment its score by c(ej, fj) for every pair of words which was observed in the training data and is present in the resource.",
        "This score is then normalized by the size of the resource, and averaged over both directions.",
        "The outcome of this process is a score for each resource.",
        "Taking these scores on a log scale and pinning the top score to associate with 20 duplications, the result is a decreasing number of duplications for each subsequent resources, based on our confidence in its entries.",
        "Thus, every entry in the resource receives credit, as long as there is evidence that the entries we have observed are reliable.",
        "On our set of resources, the process produces a score of 17 for the Haitisurf dictionary and 183 for the glossary, which is in line with what we would expect.",
        "It may be that the resources may have entries which occur in the test set but not in the training data, and thus we may inadvertently skew our distribution in a way which negatively impacts our performance, however, overall we believe it is a sound assumption that we should bias ourselves toward the more common occurrences based on the training data, as this should provide us with a higher translation probability from the good resources since the entries are repeated more often.",
        "Once we obtain a proper weighting scheme for the resources, we construct a new training corpus, and proceed forward from the alignment process.",
        "Table 2 presents the bleu and ter results of the standard strategy of duplication against the confidence weighting scheme outlined above.",
        "As can be seen, the confidence weighting scheme substantially outperforms the duplication for the dev set of both versions, but these improvements do not carry over to the clean devtest set.",
        "Therefore, for the rest of the experiments presented in the paper, we will use the confidence weighting scheme for the raw version, and the standard duplication for the clean version.",

        "Punctuation does not usually cause a problem in text-based machine translation, but this changes when venturing into the domain of SMS.",
        "Punctuation is very informative to the translation process, providing essential contextual information, much as the aforementioned sentence boundary markers.",
        "When this information is lacking, mistakes which would have otherwise been avoided can be made.",
        "Examining the data, we see there is substantially more punctuation in the clean set than in the raw.",
        "For example, there are 50% more comma's in the clean dev set than in the raw.",
        "A problem of lack of punctuation has been studied in the context of spoken language translation, where punctuation prediction on the source language prior to translation has been shown to improve performance (Dyer, 2007).",
        "We take an analogous approach here, and train a hidden 5-gram model using SRILM on the punctuated portion of the Haitian side of the parallel data.",
        "We then applied the model to punctuate the raw dev set, and tuned a system on this punctuated set.",
        "However, the translation performance did not improve.",
        "This may have been do to several factors, including the limited size of the training set, and the lack of in-domain punctuated training data.",
        "Thus, we applied a self-training approach.",
        "We applied the punctuation model to the SMS training data, which is only available in the raw format.",
        "Once punctuated, we retrained our punctuation prediction model, now including the automatically punctuated SMS data as part of the punctuation language model training data.",
        "We use this second punctuation prediction model to predict punctuation for the tuning and evaluation sets.",
        "We continue by creating a new parallel training corpus which substitutes the original SMS training data with the punctuated version, and build a new translation system from it.",
        "The results from using the self-trained punctuation method are presented in Table 3.",
        "Future experiments on the raw version are performed using this punctuation.",
        "Although the grammars of a SCFG model permit high-quality translation, the grammar extraction procedure extracts many rules which are formally licensed by the model, but are otherwise incapable of helping us produce a good translation.",
        "For example, in this task we know that the token firstname must always translate as firstname, and never as phonenum-ber.",
        "This refreshing lack of ambiguity allows us to ilter the grammar after extracting it from the training corpus, removing any grammar rule where these conditions are not met, prior to decoding.",
        "Filtering removed approximately 5% of the grammar rules.Table 4 shows the results of applying grammar il-tering to the raw and clean version.",
        "As noted above, a major cause of the performance degradation from the clean to the raw version is related to the morphological errors in the messages.",

        "In previous work, word segmentation lattices have been used to address the problem of productive compounding in morphologically rich languages, such as German, where morphemes are combined to make words but the orthography does not delineate the morpheme boundaries.",
        "These lattices encode alternative ways of segmenting compound words, and allow the decoder to automatically choose which segmentation is best for translation, leading to signiicantly improved results (Dyer, 2009).",
        "As opposed to building word segmentation lattices from a linguistic morphological analysis of a compound word, we propose to utilize the lattice to encode all alternative ways of segmenting a word as presented to us in either the clean or raw versions of a sentence.",
        "As the task requires us to produce separate clean and raw output on the test set, we tune one system on a lattice built from the clean and raw dev set, and use the single system to decode both the clean and raw test set separately.",
        "Table 5 presents the results of using segmentation lattices.",
        "As can be seen in Tables 1, 2, and 3, system performance on clean text greatly outperforms system performance on raw text, with a difference of almost 5 bleu points.",
        "Thus, we explored the possibility of automatically transforming raw text into clean text, based on the \"parallel\" raw and clean texts that were provided as part of the task.",
        "One standard approach might have been to train a Haitian-to-Haitian MT system to \"translate\" from raw text to clean text.",
        "However, since the training set was only available as raw text, and only the dev and devtest datasets had been cleaned, we clearly did not have enough data to train a raw-to-clean translation system.",
        "Thus, we created a finite-state transducer (FST) by aligning the raw dev text to the clean dev text, on a sentence-by-sentence basis.",
        "These raw-to-clean alignments were created using a simple minimum edit distance algorithm; substitution costs were calculated according to orthographic match.",
        "One option would be to use the resulting raw-to-clean transducer to greedily replace each word (or phrase) in the raw input with the predicted transformation into clean text.",
        "However, such a destructive replacement method could easily introduce cascading errors by removing text that might have been translated correctly.",
        "Fortunately, as mentioned in Section 2, and utilized in the previous section, the cdec decoder accepts lattices as input.",
        "Rather than replacing raw text with the predicted transformation into \"clean\" text, we add a path to the input lattice for each possible transform, for each word and phrase in the input.",
        "We tune a system on a lattice built from this approach on the dev set, and use the FST developed from the dev set in order to create lattices for decoding the devtest and test sets.",
        "An example is shown in Figure 3.4.",
        "Note that in this example, the transformation technique correctly inserted new paths for ilavach and ki sou, correctly retained the single path for zile, but overgenerated many (incorrect) options for nan.",
        "Note, though, that the original path for nan remains in the lattice, delaying the ambiguity resolution until later in the decoding process.",
        "Results from creating raw-to-clean transformation lattices are presented in Table 6.",
        "By comparing the results in Table 6 to those in Table 5, we can see that the noise introduced by the inite-state transformation process outweighed the Are you going to let us die on Ile à Vaches which is located close the city of Les Cayes.",
