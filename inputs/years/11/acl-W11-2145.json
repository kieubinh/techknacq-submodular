        "The baseline systems for all languages use a translation model that is trained on EPPS and the News Commentary corpus and the phrase table is based on a GIZA++ word alignment.",
        "The language model was trained on the monolingual parts of the same corpora by the SRILM Toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).",
        "It is a 4-gram SRI language model using Kneser-Ney smoothing.",
        "The problem of word reordering is addressed using the POS-based reordering model as described in Section 2.4.",
        "The part-of-speech tags for the reordering model are obtained using the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994).",
        "An in-house phrase-based decoder (Vogel, 2003) is used to perform translation and optimization with regard to the BLEU score is done using Minimum Error Rate Training as described in Venugopal et al.",
        "(2005).",
        "During decoding only the top 20 translation options for every source phrase were considered.",
        "We trained all systems using the parallel EPPS and News Commentary corpora.",
        "In addition, the UN corpus and the Giga corpus were used for training the French-English systems.",
        "Optimization was done for most languages using the news-test2008 data set and news-test2010 was used as test set.",
        "The only exception is German-English, where news-test2009 was used for optimization due to system combination arrangements.",
        "The language models for the baseline systems were trained on the monolingual versions of the training corpora.",
        "Later on, we used the News Shuffle and the Gigaword corpus to train bigger language models.",
        "For training a discriminative word alignment model, a small amount of hand-aligned data was used.",
        "The training data is preprocessed prior to training the system.",
        "This includes normalizing special symbols, smart-casing the first words of each sentence and removing long sentences and sentences with length mismatch.",
        "For the German parts of the training corpus we use the hunspell lexicon to map words written according to old German spelling to new German spelling, to obtain a corpus with homogenous spelling.",
        "Compound splitting as described in Koehn and Knight (2003) is applied to the German part of the corpus for the German-to-English system to reduce the out-of-vocabulary problem for German compound words.",
        "The Giga corpus incorporates non-neglegible amounts of noise even after our usual preprocessing.",
        "This noise may be due to different causes.",
        "For instance: non-standard HTML characters, meaningless parts composed of only hypertext codes, sentences which are only partial translation of the source, or eventually not a correct translation at all.",
        "Such noisy pairs potentially degrade the translation model quality, therefore it seemed more convenient to eliminate them.",
        "Given the size of the corpus, this task could not be performed manually.",
        "Consequently, we used an automatic classifier inspired by the work of Munteanu and Marcu (2005) on comparable corpora.",
        "This classifier should be able to filter out the pairs which likely are not beneficial for the translation model.",
        "In order to reliably decide about the classifier to use, we evaluated several techniques.",
        "The training and test sets for this evaluation were built respectively from nc-dev2007 and nc-devtest2007.",
        "In each set, about 30% randomly selected source sentences switch positions with the immediate following so that they form negative examples.",
        "We also used lexical dictionaries in both directions based on EPPS and UN corpora.",
        "We relied on seven features in our classifiers: IBM1 score in both directions, number of unaligned source words, the difference in number of words between source and target, the maximum source word fertility, number of unaligned target words, and the maximum target word fertility.",
        "It is noteworthy that all the features requiring alignment information (such as the unaligned source words) were computed on the basis of the Viterbi path of the IBM1 alignment.",
        "The following classifiers were used:",
        "Regression Choose either class based on a weighted linear combination of the features and a fixed threshold of 0.5.",
        "Logistic regression The probability of the class is expressed as a sigmoid of a linear combination of the different features.",
        "Then the class with the highest probability is picked.",
        "Maximum entropy classifier We used the same set of features to train a maximum entropy classifier using the Megam package.",
        "Support vector machines classifier An SVM classifier was trained using the SVM-light package.",
        "Results of these experiments are summarized in",
        "Table 1.",
        "The regression weights were estimated so that to minimize the squared error.",
        "This gave us a pretty poor F-measure score of 90.42%.",
        "Given that the logistic regression is more suited for binary classification in our case than the normal regression, it led to significant increase in the performance.",
        "The training",
        "Approach Precision Recall F-measure was held by maximizing the likelihood to the data with L2 regularization (with a = 0.1).",
        "This gave an F-measure score of 94.78%.",
        "The maximum entropy classifier performed better than the logistic regression in terms of precision but however it had worse F-measure.",
        "Significant improvements could be noticed using the SVM classifier in both precision and recall:",
        "F-measure.",
        "As a result, we used the SVM classifier to filter the Giga parallel corpus.",
        "The corpus contained originally around 22.52 million pairs.",
        "After preprocessing and filtering it was reduced to 16.7 million pairs.",
        "Thus throwing around 6 million pairs.",
        "In contrast to modeling the reordering by a distance-based reordering model and/or a lexicalized distortion model, we use a different approach that relies on part-of-speech (POS) sequences.",
        "By abstracting from surface words to parts-of-speech, we expect to model the reordering more accurately.",
        "To model reordering we first learn probabilistic rules from the POS tags of the words in the training corpus and the alignment information.",
        "Continuous reordering rules are extracted as described in Rottmann and Vogel (2007) to model short-range re-orderings.",
        "When translating between German and English, we apply a modified reordering model with non-continuous rules to cover also long-range re-orderings (Niehues and Kolss, 2009).",
        "The reordering rules are applied to the source text and the original order of words and the reordered sentence variants generated by the rules are encoded in a word lattice which is used as input to the decoder.",
        "For the test sentences, the POS-based reordering allows us to change the word order in the source sentence so that the sentence can be translated more easily.",
        "If we apply this also to the training sentences, we would be able to extract the phrase pairs for originally discontinuous phrases and could apply them during translation of reordered test sentences.",
        "Therefore, we build reordering lattices for all training sentences and then extract phrase pairs from the monotone source path as well as from the reordered paths.",
        "To limit the number of extracted phrase pairs, we extract a source phrase only once per sentence even if it is found in different paths.",
        "In addition to the models used in the baseline system described above we conducted experiments including additional models that enhance translation quality by introducing alternative or additional information into the translation or language modelling process.",
        "In most of our systems we use the PGIZA++ Toolkit to generate alignments between words in the training corpora.",
        "The word alignments are generated in both directions and the grow-diag-final-and heuristic is used to combine them.",
        "The phrase extraction is then done based on this word alignment.",
        "In the English-German system we applied the Discriminative Word Alignment approach as described in Niehues and Vogel (2008) instead.",
        "This alignment model is trained on a small corpus of hand-aligned data and uses the lexical probability as well as the fertilities generated by the PGIZA++ Toolkit and POS information.",
        "In phrase-based systems the source sentence is segmented by the decoder according to the best combination of phrases that maximize the translation and language model scores.",
        "This segmentation into phrases leads to the loss of context information at the phrase boundaries.",
        "Although more target side context is available to the language model, source side context would also be valuable for the decoder when searching for the best translation hypothesis.",
        "To make also source language context available we use a bilingual language model, an additional language model in the phrase-based system in which each token consist of a target word and all source words it is aligned to.",
        "The bilingual tokens enter the translation process as an additional target factor and the bilingual language model is applied to the additional factor like a normal language model.",

        "The process of phrase scoring is held in two runs.",
        "The objective of the first run is to compute the necessary counts and to estimate the scores, all based on the source phrases; while the second run is similarly held based on the target phrases.",
        "Thus, the extracted phrases have to be sorted twice: once by source phrase and once by target phrase.",
        "These two sorting operations are almost always done on an external storage device and hence consume most of the time spent in this step.",
        "The phrase scoring step was reimplemented in order to exploit the available computation resources more efficiently and therefore reduce the processing time.",
        "It uses optimized sorting algorithms for large data volumes which cannot fit into memory (Vitter, 2008).",
        "In its core, our implementation relies on STXXL: an extension of the STL library for external memory (Kettner, 2005) and on OpenMP for shared memory parallelization (Chapman et al., 2007).",
        "Table 2 shows a comparison between Moses and our phrase scoring tools.",
        "The comparison was held using sixteen-core 64-bit machines with 128 Gb RAM, where the files are accessed through NFS on a RAID disk.",
        "The experiments show that the gain grows linearly with the size of input with an average of 40% of speed up.",
        "In addition to surface word language models, we did experiments with language models based on part-of-speech for English-German.",
        "We expect that having additional information in form of probabilities of part-of-speech sequences should help especially in case of the rich morphology of German and",
        "Table2: ComparisonofMoses andKITphraseextraction systems",
        "therefore the more difficult target language generation.",
        "The part-of-speeches were generated using the TreeTagger and the RFTagger (Schmid and Laws, 2008), which produces more fine-grained tags that include also person, gender and case information.",
        "While the TreeTagger assigns 54 different POS tags to the 357K German words in the corpus, the RF-Tagger produces 756 different fine-grained tags on the same corpus.",
        "We tried n-gram lengths of 4 and 7.",
        "While no improvement in translation quality could be achieved using the POS language models based on the normal POS tags, the 4-gram POS language model based on fine-grained tags could improve the translation system by 0.2 BLEU points as shown in Table 3.",
        "Surprisingly, increasing the n-gram length to 7 decreased the translation quality again.",
        "To investigate the impact of context length, we performed an analysis on the outputs oftwo different systems, one without a POS language model and one with the 4-gram fine-grained POS language model.",
        "For each of the translations we calculated the average length of the n-grams in the translation when applying one of the two language models using 4-grams of surface words or parts-of-speech.",
        "The results are also shown in Table 3.",
        "The average n-gram length of surface words on the translation generated by the system without POS language model and the one using the 4-gram POS language model stays practically the same.",
        "When measuring the n-gram length using the 4-gram POS language model, the context increases to 3.4.",
        "This increase of context is not surprising, since with the more general POS tags longer contexts can be matched.",
        "Comparing the POS context length for the two translations, we can see that the context increases from 3.18 to 3.40 due to longer matching POS sequences.",
        "This means that the system using the POS language model actually generates translations with more probable POS sequences so that longer matches are possible.",
        "Also the perplexity drops by half since the POS language model helps constructing sentences that have a better structure.",

        "By exchanging the baseline language model by one trained on the News Shuffle corpus we improve the translation quality considerably, by more than 3 BLEU points.",
        "When we expand the coverage of the reordering rules to enable long-range reordering we can improve even further by 0.4 and adding a second language model trained on the English Gigaword corpus we gain another 0.3 BLEU points.",
        "To ensure that the phrase table also includes reordered phrases, we use lattice phrase extraction and can achieve a small improvement.",
        "Finally, a bilingual language model is added to extend the context of source language words available for translation, reaching the best score of 23.35 BLEU points.",
        "This system was used for generating the translation submitted to the German-English Translation Task.",
        "The English-to-German baseline system also includes short-range reordering and uses translation and language model based on EPPS and News Commentary.",
        "Exchanging the language model by the News Shuffle language model again yields a big improvement by 2.3 BLEU points.",

        "Replacing the GIZA++ alignments by alignments generated using the Discriminative Word Alignment Model again only leads to a small improvement.",
