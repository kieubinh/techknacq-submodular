        "One of the most remarkable success stories to come out of the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti involved translation (Munro, 2010).",
        "While other forms of emergency response and communication channels were failing, text messages were still getting through, so a number of people came together to create a free phone number for emergency text messages, which allowed earthquake victims to report those who were trapped or in need of medical attention.",
        "The problem, of course, was that most people were texting in Haitian Creole (Kreyol), a language not many of the emergency responders understood, and few, if any, professional translators were available.",
        "The availability of usable translations literally became a matter of life and death.",
        "In response to this need, Stanford University graduate student Rob Munro coordinated the rapid creation of a crowdsourcing framework, which allowed volunteers - including, for example, Haitian expatriates and French speakers - to translate messages, providing responders with usable information in as little as ten minutes.",
        "Translations may not have been perfect, but to a woman in labor, it had to have made a big difference for English-speaking responders to see Undergoing children delivery Delmas 31 instead of Fanm gen tranche poufè yon pitit nan Delmas 31.",
        "What about a scenario, though, in which even amateur bilingual volunteers are hard to find, or too few in number?",
        "What about a scenario, e.g. the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, in which there are many people worldwide who wish to help but are not fluent in both the source and target languages?",
        "For the last few years, we have been exploring the idea of monolingual crowdsourcing for translation - that is, technology-assisted collaborative translation involving crowds of participants who know only the source or target language (Buzek et al., 2010; Hu, 2009; Hu et al., 2010; Hu et al., 2011; Resnik et al., 2010).",
        "Our MonoTrans2 framework has previously shown very promising results on children's books: on a test set where Google Translate produced correct translations for only 10% of the input sentences, monolingual German and Spanish speakers using our framework produced translations that were fully correct (as judged by two independent bilinguals) nearly 70% of the time (Hu et al., 2011).",
        "We used the same framework in the WMT 2011 Haitian-English translation task.",
        "For this experiment, we hired Haitian Creole speakers located in Haiti, and recruited English speakers located in the U.S., to serve as the monolingual crowds."

        "MonoTrans2 is a translation system that combines machine translation (MT) with human computation (Quinn et al., 2011) using two \"crowds\" of monolingual source (Haitian Creole) and target (English) speakers.",
        "We summarize its operation here; see Hu et al.",
        "(2011) for details.",
        "The Haitian Creole sentence is first automatically translated into English and presented to the English speakers.",
        "The English speakers then can take any of the following actions for candidate translations:",
        "• Mark a phrase in the candidate as an error",
        "• Suggest a new translation candidate",
        "• Vote candidates up or down",
        "Identifying likely errors and voting for candidates are things monolinguals can do reasonably well: even without knowing the intended interpretation, you can often identify when some part of a sentence doesn't make sense, or when one sentence seems more fluent or plausible than another.",
        "Sometimes rather than identifying errors, it is easier to suggest an entirely new translation candidate based on the information available on the target side, a variant of monolingual post-editing (Callison-Burch et al., 2004).",
        "Any new translation candidates are then back-translated into Haitian Creole, and any spans marked as translation errors are projected back to identify the corresponding spans in the source sentence, using word alignments as the bridge (cf. Hwa et al.",
        "(2002), Yarowsky et al.",
        "(2001)).",
        "The Haitian Creole speakers can then:",
        "• Rephrase the entire source sentence (cf.",
        "• \"Explain\" spans marked as errors",
        "• Vote candidates up or down (based on the backtranslation)",
        "Source speakers can \"explain\" error spans by offering a different way of phrasing that piece of the source sentence (Resnik et al., 2010), in order to produce a new source sentence, or by annotating the spans with images (e.g. via Google image search) or Web links (e.g. to Wikipedia).",
        "The protocol then continues: new source sentences created via partialor full-sentence paraphrase pass back through MT to the English side, and any explanatory annotations are projected back to the corresponding spans in the English candidate translations (where the error spans had been identified).",
        "The process is asynchronous: participants on the Haitian Creole and English sides can work independently on whatever is available to them at any time.",
        "At any point, the voting-based scores can be used to extract a 1-best translation.",
        "In summary, the MonoTrans2 framework uses noisy MT to cross the language barrier, and supports monolingual participants in doing small tasks that gain leverage from redundant information, the human capacity for linguistic and real-world inference, and the wisdom of the crowd."

        "Of the 1,347 sentences available for processing in MonoTrans2, we define three subsets:",
        "• Touched: Sentences that were processed by at least one person (657 sentences)",
        "• Each-side: Sentences that were processed by at least one English speaker followed by at least one Haitian Creole speaker (431 sentences)",
        "• Full: Sentences that have at least three translation candidates, of which the most voted-for one received at least three votes (207 sentences)",
        "We intersect these three sets with sets A and B in order to evaluate MonoTrans2 output against the provided references (Table 2).",
        "Tables 3 and 4 report two automatic scoring metrics, uncased bleu and ter, comparing Mono-Trans2 (M2) against Google Translate (GT) as a baseline.",
        "Since the number of sentences in each evaluated set is different (Table 2), we cannot directly compare scores between the sets.",
        "However, Table 4 shows that when the MonoTrans2 process is run on test items \"to completion\", in the sense defined by \"Full\" (i.e. FullnB), we see a dramatic bleu gain of 6.39, and a drop inter of 2.29 points.",
        "Moreover, even when only target-side or only source-side monolingual participation is available we see a gain of 4.31 bleu and a drop of 1.73 ter points (Touchedn B).",
        "By contrast, the results on the devtest data are encouraging, but arguably mixed (Table 3).",
        "In order to step away from the vagaries of single-reference automatic evaluations, therefore, we also conducted an evaluation based on human judgments.",
        "Two native English speakers unfamiliar with the project were recruited and paid for fluency and adequacy judgments: for each target translation paired with its corresponding reference, each evaluator rated the target sentence's fluency and adequacy on a 5-point scale, where fluency of 5 indicates complete fluency and adequacy of 5 indicates complete preservation of meaning (Dabbadie et al., 2002).",
        "Similar to Hu et al.",
        "(2011), we adopt the very conservative criterion that a translation output is considered correct only if both evaluators independently give it a rating of 5.",
        "Unlike Hu et al.",
        "(2011), for whom children's book translation requires both fluency and adequacy, we make this a requirement only for adequacy, since in this scenario what matters to aid organizations is not whether a translation is fully fluent, but whether it is correct.",
        "On this criterion, the Google Translate baseline of around 25% correct improves to around 40% for Monotrans, consistently for both the devtest and test data (Table 5).",
        "Nonetheless, Figures 1 and 2 make it clear that the improvements in fluency are if anything more striking.",

        "Also, the amount of attention paid to target speakers' requests for clarification (numOfAnswers) is as expected related to the adequacy of the final translation, and perhaps as expected does not correlate with fluency of the output since it helps with meaning and not actual target-side wording.",
        "We were, however, confused at first by the negative influence of the roundTrips measure and vote-Count measures.",
        "We conjecture that the first effect arises due to a correlation between roundTrips and translation difficulty; much harder sentences would have led to many more paraphrase requests, and hence to more round trips.",
        "We attempted to investigate this hypothesis by testing correlation with a naive measure of sentence difficulty, length, but this was not fruitful.",
        "We suspect that inspecting use of abbreviations, proper nouns, source-side mistakes, and syntactic complexity would give us more insight into this issue.",
        "As for voteCount, the negative correlation is understandable when considered side by side with the other vote-based measure, mostSingleCandidat-eVote.",
        "Having a higher number of votes for the winning candidate leads to improvement (strongly significant for both adequacy and fluency), so a higher general vote count means that people were also voting more times for other candidates.",
        "Hence, once the positive winning vote count is taken into account, the remaining votes actually represent disagreement on the candidates, hence correlating negatively with overall improvement over baseline.",
        "It is important to note that when these measures are all considered together, they show that there is a clear correlation between the MonoTrans2 system's human processing and the eventual increase in both quality and fluency of the sentences.",
        "As people give more attention to sentences, these sentences show better performance, as judged by increase over baseline."

        "However, availability of monolingual participants is not the issue being addressed in this experiment: we are confident that in a real-world scenario like the Haitian or Japanese earthquakes, large numbers of monolingual volunteers would be eager to help, certainly in larger total numbers than bilingual volunteers.",
        "What matters here, therefore, is not how much of the test set was translated in total, but how much the translations improved for the sentences where monolingual crowdsourcing was involved, compared to the MT baseline, and what throughput might be like in a real-world scenario.",
        "We also were interested in throughput, particularly in comparison to bilingual translators.",
        "In previous experimentation (Hu et al., 2011), throughput in MonoTrans2 extrapolated to roughly 800 words per day, a factor of 2.5 slower than professional translators' typical speed of 2000 words per day.",
        "In this experiment, overall translation speed averaged about 300 words per day, a factor of more than 6 times slower.",
        "However, this is an extremely pessimistic estimate, for several reasons.",
        "First, our previous experiment had more than 20 users per side, while here our Haitian crowd consisted of only four people.",
        "Second, we discovered after beginning the experiment that the translation of our instructions into Haitian Creole had been done somewhat sloppily.",
        "And, third, we encountered a range of technical and logistical problems with our Haitian participants, ranging from finding a location with Internet access to do the work (ultimately an Internet Café turned out to be the best option), to slow and sporadic connections (even in an Internet Café), to relative lack of motivation for part-time rather than full-time work.",
        "It is fair to assume that in a real-world scenario, some unanticipated problems like these might crop up, but it also seems fair to assume that many would not; for example, most people from the Haitian Creole and French-speaking communities who volunteered using Munro et al.",
        "'s system in January 2010 were not themselves located in the third world.",
        "Finally, regarding quality, the results here are promising, albeit not as striking as those Hu et al.",

        "The nature of SMS messages themselves may have been a contributing factor to the lower translation adequacy: even in clean form, these are sometimes written using shorthand (e.g. \"SVP\"), and are sometimes not syntactically correct.",
        "The text messages are seldom related to each other, unlike sentences in larger bodies of text where even partially translated sentences can be related to each other to provide context, as is the case for children's books.",
        "One should also keep in mind that the underlying machine translation engine, Google Translate between Haitian Creole and English, is still in an alpha phase.",
        "Those considerations notwithstanding, it is encouraging to see a set of machine translations get better without the use of any human bilingual expertise.",
        "We are optimistic that with further refinements and research, monolingual translation crowdsourc-ing will make it possible to harness the vast number of technologically connected people who want to help in some way when disaster strikes."
