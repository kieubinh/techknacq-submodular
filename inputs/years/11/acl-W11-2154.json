        "Target LMs are standard 4-gram models trained on the provided monolingual corpus (mono-news-c, mono-euro and news-s).",
        "We decided to test two different n-gram cut-off settings.",
        "The fist set has low cut-offs: 1-2-3-3 (respectively for 1-gram, 2-gram, 3-gram and 4-gram counts), whereas the second one (LM2) is more aggressive: 1-5-7-7.",
        "Experiment results (Table 3, Systems 3 and 4) show that resorting to LM2 leads to an improvement of BLEU with respect to LM1 .",
        "LM2 was therefore used in the subsequent experiments.",
        "Translation models were trained from the parallel corpora news-c, euro and UN.",
        "Data were aligned at the word-level and then used to build standard phrase-based translation models.",
        "We filtered the obtained phrase table using the method described in (Johnson et al., 2007).",
        "Since this technique drastically reduces the size of the phrase table, while not degrading (and even slightly improving) the results on the development and test corpora (System 6), we decided to employ filtered phrase tables in the final configuration of the LIG system.",
        "For decoding, the system uses a log-linear combination of translation model scores with the LM log-probability.",
        "We prevent phrase reordering over punctuation using the Moses option -monotone-at-punctuation.",
        "As the system can be beforehand tuned by adjusting the log-linear combination weights on a development corpus, we used the MERT method (System 5).",
        "Optimizing weights according to BLEU leads to an improvement with respect to the system with Moses default value weights (System 5 vs System 4).",
        "We also investigated the interest of a statistical post-editor (SPE) to improve translation hypotheses.",
        "About 9,000 sentences extracted from the news domain test corpora of the 2007-2009 WMT translation tasks were automatically translated by a system very similar to that described in (Potet et al., 2010), then manually post-edited.",
        "Manual corrections of translations were performed by means of the crowd-sourcing platform Amazon Mechanical Turk ($0.15/sent.).",
        "These collected data make a parallel corpus whose source part is MT output and target part is the human post-edited version of MT output.",
        "This are used to train a phrase-based SMT (with Moses without the tuning step) that automatically post-edit the MT output.",
        "That aims at learning how to correct translation hypotheses.",
