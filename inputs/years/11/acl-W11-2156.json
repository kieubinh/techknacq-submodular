        "During years there has been a big effort to produce natural language processing tools that try to understand well written sentences, but the question is how well do these tools work to analyze the contents of SMS.",
        "For example, not even syntactic tools like stemming can bring to common stems words that have been shortened (like Xmas or Christmas).",
        "This paper describes our participation on the 6th Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT 2011).",
        "The featured task from the workshop was to translate Haitian-Creole SMS messages into English.",
        "According to the WMT 2011 organizers, these text messages (SMS) were sent by people in Haiti in the aftermath of the January 2010 earthquake.",
        "Our objective in this featured task is to translate from Haitian-Creole into English either using raw or clean data.",
        "We propose to build an SMT system which could be used for both raw and clean data.",
        "Our baseline system is an standard phrase-based SMT system built with Moses (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "Starting from this system we propose to introduce a semantic feature function based on latent semantic indexing (Landauer et al., 1998).",
        "Additionally, as a total different approximation, we propose to orthogonalize the standard feature functions of the phrase-based table using the Gram-Schmidt methodology (Greub, 1975).",
        "Then, we experimentally combine both enhancements.",
        "The only difference among the raw and clean SMT system were the training sentences.",
        "In order to translate the clean data, we propose to normalize the corpus of short messages given very scarce resources.",
        "We only count with a small set of parallel corpus at the level of sentence of chat and standard language.",
        "A nice normalization methodology can allow to make the task of communication easier.",
        "We propose a statistical normalization technique using the scarce resources we have based on a combination of statistical machine translation techniques.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 briefly describes the phrase-based SMT system which is used as a reference system.",
        "Next, section 3 describes our approximation to introduce semantics in the baseline system.",

        "Section 5 details the data processing and the data conversion from raw to clean.",

        "The phrase-based approach to SMT performs the translation splitting the source sentence in segments and assigning to each segment a bilingual phrase from a phrase-table.",
        "Bilingual phrases are translation units that contain source words and target words, e.g. unité de traduction – translation unit, and have different scores associated to them.",
        "These bilingual phrases are then selected in order to maximize a linear combination of feature functions.",
        "Such strategy is known as the log-linear model (Och, 2003) and it is formally defined as:",
        "where hm are different feature functions with weights Am.",

      "text": [
        "Source context information is generally disregarded in phrase-based systems given that all training sentences contribute equally to the final translation.",
        "The main objective in this section is to motivate the use of a semantic feature function we have recently proposed (Banchs and Costa-jussa, 2011) for incorporating source context information into the phrase-based statistical machine translation framework.",
        "Such a feature is based on the use of a similarity metric for assessing the degree of similarity between the sentences to be translated and the sentences in the original training dataset.",
        "The measured similarity is used to favour those translation units that have been extracted from training sentences that are similar to the current sentence to be translated and to penalize those translation units than have been extracted from unrelated or dissimilar training sentences.",
        "In the proposed feature, sentence similarity is measured by means of the cosine distance in a reduced dimension vector-space model, which is constructed by using Latent Semantic Indexing (Landauer et al., 1998), a well know dimensionality reduction technique that is based on the singular value decomposition of a matrix (Golub and Kahan, 1965).",
        "The main motivation of this semantic feature is the fact that source context information is actually helpful for disambiguating the sense of a given word during the translation process.",
        "Consider for instance the Spanish word banco which can be translated into English as either bank or bench depending on the specific context it occurs.",
        "By comparing a given input sentence containing the Spanish word banco with all training sentences from which phrases including this word where extracted, we can figure out which is the most appropriated sense for this word in the given sentence.",
        "This is because for the sense bank the Spanish word banco will be more like to co-occur with words such as dinero (money), cuenta (account), intereses (interest), etc., while for the sense bench it would be more likely to co-occur with words such as plaza (square), parque (park), mesa (table), etc; and the chances are high for such disambiguating words to appear in one or more of the training sentences from which bilingual phrases containing banco has been extracted.",
        "In the particular case of translation tasks where multi-domain corpora is used for training machine translation systems, such as the Haitian-Creole-to-English task considered here, the proposed semantic feature has proven to contribute to a better lexical selection during the decoding process.",
        "However, in tasks considering mono-domain corpora the semantic feature does not improves translation quality as the most frequent translation pairs learned by the system are actually the correct ones.",
        "Another important issue related to the semantic feature discussed here is that it is a dynamic feature in the sense that it is computed for each potential translation unit according to the current input sentence being translated.",
        "This makes the implementation of this semantic feature very expensive from a computational point of view.",
        "At this moment, we do not have an efficient implementation, which makes it unfeasible in the practice to apply this methodology to large training corpora.",
        "As the training corpus available for the Haitian-Creole-to-English is both small in size and multidomain in nature, it constitutes the perfect scenario for experimenting with the recently proposed source context semantic feature.",
        "For more details about implementation and performance of this methodology in a different translation task, the reader should refer to (Banchs and Costa-jussa, 2011)."

        "The phrase-based SMT baseline system contains, by default, 5 feature functions which are the conditional and posterior probabilities, the direct and indirect lexical scores and the phrase penalty.",
        "Usually, these feature functions are not statistical independent from each other.",
        "Based on the analogy between the statistical and geometrical concepts of independence and orthogonality, and given that, during MERT, the optimization of feature combination is conducted on log-probability space; we decided to explore the effect of using a set of orthogonal features during MERT optimization.",
        "It is well know in both spectral analysis and vector space decomposition that orthogonal bases allow for optimal representations of signals and variables, as they allow for each individual natural component to be represented independently of the others.",
        "In linear lattice predictors, for instance, each filter coefficient can be optimized independently from the others while convergence to the optimal solution is guarantied (Haykin, 1996).",
        "In the case of statistical machine translation, the linear nature of feature combination in log-probability space suggested us that transforming the features into a set of orthogonal features could make MERT optimization more robust and efficient.",
        "According to this, we used Gram-Schmidt (Greub, 1975) to transform all available feature functions into an orthogonal set of feature functions.",
        "This orthogonalization process was conducted directly over the log-probability space, i.e, given the five vectors representing the feature functions h1,h2,h3,h4,h5, we used the GramSchmidt algorithm to construct an orthogonal basis v1,v2,vs,V4,v5.",
        "The resulting set of features consisted of 5 vectors that form an orthogonal basis.",
