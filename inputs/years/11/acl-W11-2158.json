        "This paper describes the statistical machine translation systems developed by the Computer Science laboratory at the University of Le Mans (LIUM) for the 2011 WMT shared task evaluation.",
        "We only considered the translation between French and English (in both directions).",
        "The main differences with respect to previous year's system (Lambert et al., 2010) are as follows: use of more training data as provided by the organizers, improved translation model adaptation by unsupervised training, a continuous space language model for the translation into French, some attempts to automatically induce translations of unknown words and first experiments with hierarchical systems.",
        "These different points are described in the rest of the paper, together with a summary of the experimental results showing the impact of each component.",
        "The following sections describe how the resources provided or allowed in the shared task were used to train the translation and language models of the system.",
        "Our system was developed in two stages.",
        "First, a baseline system was built to generate automatic translations of some of the monolingual data available.",
        "These automatic translations were then used directly with the source texts to create additional bi-texts.",
        "In a second stage, these additional bilingual data were incorporated into the system (see Section 5 and Tables 4 and 5).",
        "The latest version of the News-Commentary (NC) corpus and of the Europarl (Eparl) corpus (version 6) were used.",
        "We also took as training data a subset of the French-English Gigaword (10) corpus.",
        "We applied the same filters as last year to select this subset.",
        "The first one is a lexical filter based on the IBM model 1 cost (Brown et al., 1993) of each side of a sentence pair given the other side, normalised with respect to both sentence lengths.",
        "This filter was trained on a corpus composed of Eparl, NC, and UN data.",
        "The other filter is an n-gram language model (LM) cost of the target sentence (see Section 3), normalised with respect to its length.",
        "This filter was trained with all monolingual resources available except the 10 data.",
        "We generated two subsets, both by selecting sentence pairs with a lexical cost inferior to 4, and an LM cost respectively inferior to 2.3 (IO, 115 million English words) and 2.6 (10?,, 232 million English words).",
        "Available human translated bitexts such as the Eu-roparl or 10 corpus seem to be out-of domain for this task.",
        "We used two types of automatically extracted resources to adapt our system to the task domain.",
        "First, we generated automatic translations of the provided monolingual News corpus and selected the sentences with a normalised translation cost (returned by the decoder) inferior to a threshold.",
        "The resulting bitext contain no new translations, since all words of the translation output come from the translation model, but it contains new combinations (phrases) of known words, and reinforces the probability of some phrase pairs (Schwenk, 2008).",
        "This year, we improved this method in the following way.",
        "In the original approach, the automatic translations are added to the human translated bitexts and a complete new system is build, including time consuming word alignment with GIZA++.",
        "For WMT'11, we directly used the word-to-word alignments produced by the decoder at the output instead of GIZA's alignments.",
        "This speeds-up the procedure and yields the same results in our experiments.",
        "A detailed comparison is given in (Lambert et al., 2011).",
        "Second, as in last year's evaluation, we automatically extracted and aligned parallel sentences from comparable in-domain corpora.",
        "We used the AFP and APW news texts since there are available in the French and English LDC Gigaword corpora.",
        "The general architecture of our parallel sentence extraction system is described in detail by Abdul-Rauf and Schwenk (2009).",
        "We first translated 91M words from French into English using our first stage SMT system.",
        "These English sentences were then used to search for translations in the English AFP and APW texts of the Gigaword corpus using information retrieval techniques.",
        "The Lemur toolkit (Ogilvie and Callan, 2001) was used for this purpose.",
        "Search was limited to a window of ±5 days of the date of the French news text.",
        "The retrieved candidate sentences were then filtered using the Translation Error Rate (TER) with respect to the automatic translations.",
        "In this study, sentences with a TER below 75% were kept.",
        "Sentences with a large length difference (French versus English) or containing a large fraction of numbers were also discarded.",
        "By these means, about 27M words of additional bitexts were obtained.",
        "The French and English target language models were trained on all provided monolingual data.",
        "In addition, LDC's Gigaword collection was used for both languages.",
        "Data corresponding to the development and test periods were removed from the Giga-word collections.",
        "All development was done on newstest2009, and newstest2010 was used as internal test set.",
        "The default Moses tokenization was used.",
        "However, we added abbreviations for the French tokenizer.",
        "All our models are case sensitive and include punctuation.",
        "The BLEU scores reported in this paper were calculated with the tool multi-bleu.perl and are case sensitive."

        "The goal of statistical machine translation (SMT) is to produce a target sentence e from a source sentence f. Our main system is a phrase-based system (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2003), but we have also performed some experiments with a hierarchical system (Chiang, 2007).",
        "Both use a log linear framework in order to introduce several models explaining the translation process:",
        "The feature functions hi are the system models and the Ai weights are typically optimized to maximize a scoring function on a development set (Och and Ney, 2002).",
        "The phrase-based system uses fourteen features functions, namely phrase and lexical translation probabilities in both directions, seven features for the lexicalized distortion model, a word and a phrase penalty and a target language model (LM).",
        "The hierarchical system uses only 8 features: a LM weight, a word penalty and six weights for the translation model.",
        "Both systems are based on the Moses SMT toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007) and constructed as follows.",
        "First, word alignments in both directions are calculated.",
        "We used a multi-threaded version of the GIZA++ tool (Gao and Vogel, 2008).",
        "This speeds up the process and corrects an error of GIZA++ that can appear with rare words.",
        "Phrases, lexical reorderings or hierarchical rules are extracted using the default settings of the Moses toolkit.",
        "The parameters of Moses were tuned on newstest2009, using the 'new' MERT tool.",
        "We repeated the training process three times, each with a different seed value for the optimisation algorithm.",
        "In this way we have an rough idea of the error introduced by the tuning process.",
        "4-gram back-off LMs were used.",
        "The word list contains all the words of the bitext used to train the translation model and all words that appear at least ten times in the monolingual corpora.",
        "Words of the monolingual corpora containing special characters or sequences of uppercase characters were not included in the word list.",
        "Separate LMs were build on each data source with the SRI LM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) and then linearly interpolated, optimizing the coefficients with an EM procedure.",
        "The perplexities of these LMs were 99.4 for French and 129.7 for English.",
        "In addition, we build a 5-gram continuous space language model for French (Schwenk, 2007).",
        "This model was trained on all the available French texts using a resampling technique.",
        "The continuous space language model is interpolated with the 4-gram back-off model and used to rescore n-best lists.",
        "This reduces the perplexity by about 8% relative."

        "With the IR additional bitext added to Eparl+NC+10?>, we observe no improvement in French to English, and a very small improvement in English to French.",
