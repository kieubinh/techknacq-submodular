        "Furthermore, Haitian Creole is a low resource language, for which there are few language technology tools and corpora available.",
        "Our main focus has been to make the best possible use of the available training data through different ways of cleaning the data, and by replacing unknown words in the test data by plausible spelling equivalents.",

        "We also used a lexicalized reordering model (Koehn et al., 2005).",
        "We optimized each system separately using minimum error rate training (Och, 2003).",
        "The development and devtest data were available in two versions, as raw, noisy data, and in a clean version, where the raw data had been cleaned by human post-editors.",
        "The different subcorpora had different tokeniza-tions and casing conventions.",
        "We normalized punctuation by applying a tokenizer that separated most punctuation marks into separate tokens, excluding apostrophes that were suspected to belong to contracted words or Haitian short forms, periods for abbreviations, and periods in URLs.",
        "There were often many consecutive punctuation marks; these were replaced by only the first of the punctuation marks.",
        "In the English translations of the SMS data there were often translator's notes at the end of the translations.",
        "These were removed when introduced by two standard formulations: Additional Notes or translator's note/interpretation.",
        "In addition the translation marker The SMS [...] were removed.",
        "Case information was inconsistent, especially for SMS data, and for this reason we lower-cased all Haitian source data.",
        "On the English target side we wanted to use true-cased data, since we wanted case distinctions in the translation output.",
        "We based the true-casing on Koehn and Haddow (2009), who changed the case of the first word in each sentence, to the most common case variant of that word in the corpus when it is not sentence initial.",
        "In the noisy SMS data, though, there were many sentences with all capital letters that would influence this truecasing method negatively.",

        "This is different to the common situation of domain adaptation, as in the standard WMT shared tasks, where there is a small bilingual in-domain corpus, a larger in-domain monolingual corpus, and possibly several out-of-domain corpora that can be both monolingual and bilingual.",
        "In such a scenario it is often useful to use all available training data for both translation and language models, possibly in separate models (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007).",
        "Table 1 summarizes how we used the available corpora, in our different models.",
        "For translation and language models we separated the bilingual data into three parts, the SMS data, the Bible, and everything else.",
        "For our lexicalized reordering model we only used SMS data, since we believe word order there is likely to differ from the other corpora.",
        "For the English true-casing model we concatenated the English side of all bilingual corpora that were not lower-cased.",
        "Table 2 shows the results of the different model combinations on the clean devtest data.",
        "When we used only the SMS data in the translation model, the scores changed only slightly regardless of which combinations of language models we used.",
        "Using two translation models for the SMS data and the other bilingual data overall gave better results than when only using SMS data for the translation model.",
        "With double translation models it was best only to use the SMS data in the language model.",
        "Including the Bible data had a minor impact.",
        "Based on these experiments we will use all available training data in two translation models, one for SMS and one for everything else, but only use SMS data in one language model, which corresponds to the line marked in bold in Table 2, and which we will call the dual system.",
        "We did not perform model combination experiments for the raw input data, since we believed the pattern would be similar as for the clean data.",
        "The results for the raw devtest as input are considerably lower than for the clean data.",
        "Using the best model combination, we got a Bleu score of only 26.25, which can be compared to 29.90 using the clean data."

        "It is also the case that many of the OOVs are not wrong, but just happen to be unseen; for instance there are many place names.",
        "Thus we must make sure that our algorithm for finding spelling equivalents is bi-directional, so that it cannot only change incorrect spellings into correct spellings, but also go the other way, which could be needed in some cases.",
        "We also need to try not to suggest alternatives for words that does not have any plausible alternatives in the corpus, such as unknown place names.",
        "The approximate string matching algorithm we suggest is essentially that of Brill and Moore (2000), a modified weighted Levenshtein distance, where we allow error operations on character sequences as well as on single characters.",
        "We based our weight estimations on the automatically created list of lexical variants that was built as a step in building the cleaning model, described in section 4.",
        "This list is very noisy, but does also contain some true spelling equivalents.",
        "We implemented two versions of the algorithm, first a simple version which used manually identified error operations, then a more complex variant where error operations and weights were found automatically.",
        "Manually Assigned Weights",
        "We went through the lexicon list manually to identify edits that could correct the misspellings that occurred in the list.",
        "We identified substitutions limited to three characters in length, and at the beginning and end of words we also identified letter insertions and deletions.",
        "The inspection showed that it was very common for letters to be replaced by the same letter but with a diacritic, or with a different diacritic, for instance to vary between [e, e, e].",
        "Another common operation was between a single character and two consecutive occurrences of the same character.",
        "Table 4 shows the 46 identified operations.",
        "To account for the fact that we do not want our error model to have a directionality from wrong to correct, we allow operations in both directions.",
        "Since the operations were found manually we did not have a reliable way to estimate weights, and used uniform weights for all operations.",
        "The operations in Table 4 have the weights given in the table, substitution of a letter with a diacritic variant 0, single to double letters 0.1, insertions and deletions 1 and substitutions other than those in the table, 1.6.",
        "Automatically Assigned Weights",
        "To automatically train weights from the very noisy list of lexical variants, we filtered it by applying the edit distance with the manual weights described above to phrase pair that did not differ in length by more than three characters.",
        "We used a cut-offthresh-old of 2.8 for words where both versions had at least six characters, and 1 for shorter words.",
        "This gave us a list of 587 plausible spelling variants, from the original list with 1635 word pairs.",
        "To find good character substitutions and assign weights to them, we used standard PBSMT techniques as implemented in Moses, but on character level, with the filtered list of word pairs as training data.",
        "We inserted spaces between each character of the words, and also added beginning and end of word markers, e.g., the word problem was tokenized as 'B p r o b l e m E'.",

        "For manually defined operations all instances are shown, with their uniform score.",
        "For automaticcally identified operations examples are shown with their score, and the total count of each operation type.",
        "amounts to creating a phrase-table with character sequences.",
        "The phrase probabilities are given in both translation directions, P(S|T) and P(T|S).",
        "Since we do not want our scores to have any direction, we used the arithmetic mean of these two probabilities to calculate the score for the pair, which is calculated as 1 - ((P(S|T) + P(T|S))/2), to also convert the probabilities to costs.",
        "To compensate for errors made in the extraction process, we filtered out phrase pairs where both probabilities were lower than 0.1.",
        "To get fair scores for character sequences of different lengths we applied the phrase table construction four times, while increasing the limit of the maximum phrase length from one to four.",
        "From the first phrase table, with maximum length 1, we extracted 1-1 substitutions, from the second table 1-2 and 2-2 substitutions, and so on.",
        "We used the beginning and end of word markers both to extract substitutions that were only used at the beginning or end of sentences, and to extract deletions and insertions used at the beginning and end of words.",
        "Again, we only allowed substitutions up to three characters in length.",
        "The fourth phrase-table, with phrases of length four, were only used to allow us to extract substitutions of length three at the beginning and end of words, since the markers count as tokens.",
