        "Our system is different from the system of the last year (Federmann et al., 2010), which is based on the shallow phrase substitution.",
        "In this work, two rule-based translation systems are applied.",
        "In addition, three statistical machine translation systems are built, including a phrase-based, a hierarchical phrase-based and a syntax-based system.",
        "Instead of combining with rules or post-editing, we perform system combination on the final translation hypotheses.",
        "We applied the CMU open toolkit (Heafield and Lavie, 2010) among numerous combination methods such as (Matusov, 2009), (Sim et al., 2007) and (He et al., 2008).",
