        "Hierarchical phrase-based (Hiero) machine translation (Chiang, 2007) has attracted significant interest within the Machine Translation community.",
        "It extends phrase-based translation by automatically inferring a synchronous grammar from an aligned bitext.",
        "The synchronous context-free grammar links non-terminals in source and target languages.",
        "Decoding in such systems employ a modified CKY-parser that is integrated with a language model.",
        "The primary advantage of Hiero-style systems lie in their unsupervised model of syntax for translation: allowing long-distance reordering and capturing certain syntactic constructions, particularly those that involve discontiguous phrases.",
        "It has been demonstrated to be a successful framework with comparable performance with other statistical frameworks and suitable for large-scale corpora (Zollmann et al., 2008).",
        "However, one of the major difficulties in Hiero-style systems has been on learning a concise and general synchronous grammar from the bitext.",
        "While most of the research in Hiero-style systems is focused on the improving the decoder, and in particular the link to the language model, comparatively few papers have considered the inference of the probabilistic SCFG from the word alignments.",
        "A majority of the systems employ the classic rule-extraction algorithm (Chiang, 2007) which extracts rules by replacing possible sub-spans (permitted by the word alignments) with a non-terminal and then using relative frequencies to estimate the probabilistic synchronous context-free grammar.",
        "One of the issues in building Hiero-style systems is in managing the size of the synchronous grammar.",
        "The original approach extracts a larger number of rules when compared to a phrase-based system on the same data leading to practical issues in terms of memory requirements and decoding speed.",
        "Extremely large Hiero phrase tables may also lead to statistical issues, where the probability mass has to be shared by more rules: the probability p(e\\f ) has to be shared by all the rules having the same source side string f, leading to fragmentation and resulting in many rules having very poor probability.",
        "Approaches to improve the inference (the induction of the SCFG rules from the bitext) typically follows two streams.",
        "One focusses on filtering the extracted hierarchical rules either by removing redundancy (He et al., 2009) or by filtering rules based on certain patterns (Iglesias et al., 2009), while the other stream is concerned about alternative approaches for learning the synchronous grammar (Blunsom et al., 2008; Blunsom et al., 2009; de Gispert et al., 2010).",
        "This paper falls under the latter category and we use a non-parametric Bayesian approach for rule extraction for Hiero-style systems.",

        "The large number of rules in Hiero-style systems leads to slow decoding and increased memory requirements.",
        "The heuristic rule extraction algorithm (Chiang, 2007) introduces redundant monotone composed rules (He et al., 2009) in the SCFG grammar.",
        "The research on Hiero rule extraction falls into two broad categories: i) rule reduction by eliminating a subset of rules extracted by the heuristic approach and ii) alternate approaches for rule extraction.",
        "There have been approaches to reduce the size of Hiero phrase table, without significantly affecting the translation quality.",
        "He et.",
        "al.",
        "(2009) proposed the idea of discarding monotone composed rules from the phrase table that can instead be obtained dynamically by combining the minimal rules in the same order.",
        "They achieve up to 70% reduction in the phrase table by discarding these redundant rules, without appreciable reduction in the performance as measured by BLEU.",
        "Empirically analyzing the effectiveness of specific rule patterns, (Iglesias et al., 2009) show that some patterns having over 95% of the total SCFG rules can be safely eliminated without any reduction in the BLEU score.",
        "Along a different track, some prior works have employed alternate rule extraction approaches using a Bayesian framework (DeNero et al., 2008; Blunet al., 2008) use a Maximum likelihood model of learning phrase pairs (Marcu and Wong, 2002), but use sampling to compute the expected counts of the phrase pairs for the E-step.",
        "Other recent approaches use Gibbs sampler for learning the SCFG by exploring a fixed grammar having predefined rule templates (Blunsom et al., 2008) or by reasoning over the space of derivations (Blunsom et al., 2009).",
        "We differ from earlier Bayesian approaches in that our model is guided by the word alignments to reason over the space of the SCFG rules and this restricts the search space of our model.",
        "We believe the word alignments to encode information, useful for identifying the good phrase-pairs.",
        "For example, several attempts have been made to learn a phrasal translation model directly from the bitext without the word alignments (Marcu and Wong, 2002; DeNero et al., 2008; Blunsom et al., 2008), but without any clear breakthrough that can scale to larger corpora.",
        "Our model exploits the word alignment information in the form of lexical alignment probability in order to construct an informative prior over SCFG rules and it moves away from a heuristic framework, instead using a Bayesian non-parametric model to infer a minimal, high-quality grammar from the data."

        "Our model is based on similar assumptions as the original Hiero system.",
        "We assume that the bitext has been word aligned, and that we can use that word alignment to extract phrase pairs.",
        "Given the word alignments and the heuristically extracted phrase pairs Rp, our goal is to extract the minimal set of hierarchical rules Rg that would best explain Rp.",
        "This is achieved by inferring a distribution over the derivations for each phrase pair, where the set of derivations collectively specify the grammar.",
        "In the following, we denote the sequence of derivations for the set of phrase pairs by r, which is composed of grammar rules r. We will essentially read off our learned grammar from the sequence of derivations r.",
        "Our non-parametric model reasons over the space of the (hierarchical and terminal) rules and samples a set of rules by employing a prior based on the alignment probability of the words in the phrase pairs.",
        "We hypothesize that the resulting grammar will be compact and also will explain the phrase pairs better (the SCFG rules will maximize the likelihood of producing the entire set of observed phrase pairs).",
        "Using Bayes' rule, the posterior over the derivations r given the phrase pairs Rp can be written as:",
        "where P(Rp\\r) is equal to one when the sequence of rules r and phrase-pairs Rp are consistent, i.e. r can be partitioned into derivations to compose the set of phrase-pairs such that the derivations respect the given word alignments; otherwise P(Rp\\r) is zero.",
        "The overall structure of the model is analogous to the Bayesian model for inducing Tree Substitution Grammars proposed by Cohn et al.",
        "(2009).",
        "Note that, our model extracts hierarchical rules for the word-aligned phrase pairs and not for the sentences.",
        "Similar to the other Hiero-style systems, we use two types of rules: terminal and hierarchical rules.",
        "For each phrase-pair, our model either generates a terminal rule by not segmenting the phrase-pair, or decides to segment the phrase-pair and extract some rules.",
        "Though it is possible to segment phrase-pairs by two (or more) non-overlapping spans, we propose a simpler model in this paper and restrict the hierarchical rules to contain only one non-terminal (unlike the case of classic Hiero-style grammars containing two non-terminals).",
        "This simpler model, samples the space of derivations and identifies a sub-span for introducing the non-terminal, which can be expressed as terminal rules (it is not decomposed further).",
        "Figure 1 shows an example phrase-pair with the Viterbi-best word alignment and Figure 2 shows two possible derivations for the same phrase-pair with the non-terminals introduced at different subspans.",
        "It can be seen that the sub-phrase corresponding to the non-terminal span X1 is directly written as a terminal rule and is not decomposed further.",
        "While the resulting model is slightly weaker than the original Hiero grammar, it should be noted our simpler model does allow reordering and discontiguous alignments.",
        "For example our model includes rules such as, X – (aX1ß,a' ß'X1), which can capture phrases like (not Xi, ne X\\ pas) in the case of English-French translation.",
        "In terms of the reordering, our model lies in between the hierarchical phrase-based and phrase-based models.",
        "To summarize, the segmentation of each phrase-pair in our model results in two rules: a hierarchical rule with one nonterminal as well as a terminal rule.",
        "More specifically, the generative process for generating a phrase pair x from the grammar rules may have two steps as follows.",
        "In the first step, the model decides on the type of the rule tx G {Terminal, Hierarchical} used to generate the phrase-pair based on a Bernoulli distribution, having a prior 7 coming from a Beta distribution:",
        "The lexical alignment probability 1x controls the tendency for extracting hierarchical rules from the phrase-pair x.",
        "For a given phrase-pair, 1x is computed by taking the (geometric or arithmetic) average of the reverse and forward alignment probabilities, which we explain later in this section.",
        "integrating out 7 gives us the conditional probabilities of choosing the rule type tx as:",
        "where nxerm and nflier denote the number of terminal or hierarchical rules, among the rules extracted so far from the phrase-pair x during the sampling.",
        "In the second step, if the rule type tx = Hierarchical, the model generates the phrase-pair by sampling from the hierarchical and terminal rules.",
        "We use a Dirichlet Process (DP) to model the generation of hierarchical rules r:",
        "integrating out the grammar G, the predictive distribution of a hierarchical rule rx for generating the current phrase-pair (conditioned on the rules from the rest of the phrase-pairs) is:",
        "where n-xx is the count of the rule rx in the rest of the phrase-pairs that is represented by r-x, P0 is the base measure, and ah is the concentration parameter controlling the model's preference towards using an existing hierarchical rule from the cache or to create a new rule sanctioned by the base distribution.",

        "This can be accomplished by using a model that is closer to the Tree Substitution Grammar induction model in (Cohn et al., 2009) but in our case the model would infer a Hiero-style SCFG from word-aligned sentence pairs."
