        "Its multilingual counterpart, Cross-Lingual Lexical Substitution (CLLS), aims at finding for a target word in context, alternative substitute words in another language.",

        "The multilingual context in which CLLS is performed permits to override some issues common to monolingual semantic processing tasks, such as the selection of an adequate sense inventory and the definition of the granularity of the semantic descriptions.",

        "Word sense induction (WSI) methods offer an alternative to the use of predefined semantic resources for NLP.",
        "They automatically define the senses of words from textual data and may adapt the obtained descriptions to the WSD needs of specific applications.",
        "In a monolingual context, WSI is performed by exploiting more or less refined distributional information (Navigli, 2009), while in a multilingual context WSI is mostly based on translation information.",
        "In this setting, the senses of words in one language are identified by their translations in another language, usually found in a parallel corpus (Resnik and Yarowsky, 2000).",
        "This empirical approach to sense induction offers a standard criterion for sense delimitation and, consequently, dissociates WSD from semantic theories and predefined semantic inventories.",
        "Moreover, by establishing semantic distinctions pertinent for translation between the implicated languages, it allows to tune sense induction to the needs of multilingual applications.",
        "It has thus been widely adopted in works on multilingual WSD and WSD in MT, where senses are derived from parallel data (Diab, 2003; Ide, 1999; Ide et al., 2002; Ng et al., 2003; Chan et al., 2007; Carpuat and Wu, 2007).",
        "By linking WSD and its evaluation to translation, this hypothesis also offers a solution to the problem of nonconformity of monolingual WSD methods in this setting.",
        "Nevertheless, the assumption of biunivocal ('one-to-one') correspondences between senses and translations is rather simplistic.",
        "One word sense may be translated by different synonymous words in another language, whose relatedness should be considered during sense induction.",
        "Furthermore, this approach does not permit to account for cases of parallel ambiguities (Resnik, 2007), and cases where the senses of a word share some of their translations (Sinha et al., 2009).",
        "Additional problems arise at the practical level as the induced senses are uniform and, so, the constraints used during WSD for selecting between close and distant senses are similar.",
        "Furthermore, when WSD coincides with lexical selection in MT, the selection of a translation different from the reference is considered as wrong even if it is semantically correct.",
        "So, this conception of senses does not permit to penalize WSD errors relatively to their importance (Resnik and Yarowsky, 2000), unless semantic resources are used to identify semantic correspondences.",
        "Instead of using translations as straightforward sense indicators, it is possible to perform a more thorough semantic analysis during cross-lingual WSI by combining distributional and translation information.",
        "The sense clustering method proposed by Apidianaki (2008) identifies complex semantic relations between word senses and their translations.",
        "The method is based on the contextual hypotheses of meaning and of semantic similarity (Harris, 1954; Miller and Charles, 1991), which underlie monolingual WSI methods, and is combined to the assumption of a semantic correspondence between words and their translations in real texts (Chester-man, 1998).",
        "Following these hypotheses, information coming from the source contexts of a target word when translated with a precise translation in a parallel corpus, is used to reveal the senses carried by the translation.",
        "Furthermore, the similarity of the source contexts reveals the semantic relatedness of the translations.",
        "This cross-lingual WSI method groups the semantically similar translations of ambiguous words into clusters that serve to describe their senses instead of the individual translations.",
        "For instance, the traditional cross-lingual WSI approach would propose three senses for the English noun coach, corresponding to each of its Spanish translations: entrenador, autocar and autobus.",
        "However, this solution is not sound given that the translations autocar and autobUs are semantically related and do not lexical-ize distinct senses of the English word, as is the case with entrenador.",
        "Sense clustering permits to estimate the semantic similarity of the translations and to not consider synonymous translations as indicators of distinct senses.",
        "Consequently, the English word coach has two senses after sense clustering: one described by the cluster {autocar, autobus} (the \"bus\" sense) and one described by the cluster {entrenador} (the \"trainer\" sense).",
        "In the automatically built bilingual inventories, the senses of the words in one language are thus described by clusters of their translations in another language.",
        "This type of sense clustering has proved to be useful in various application settings.",
        "When exploited in cross-lingual WSD, it permits to assign 'sensetags' containing several semantically correct translations to new instances of words in context (Apid-ianaki, 2009).",
        "Moreover, the use of clustering information during evaluation allows for a differing penalization of WSD errors.",
        "In an MT evaluation setting, sense clusters have been integrated into an MT evaluation metric (METEOR) (Lavie and Agar-wal, 2007) and brought about an increase ofthe metric's correlation with human judgments of translation quality in different languages (Apidianaki and He, 2010).",
        "The use of sense clusters in this setting permits to identify semantic correspondences between translations and hypotheses, and to circumvent the strict requirement for exact surface correspondences, one of the main critics addressed to MT evaluation metrics.",
        "The same notion of sense clusters has been adopted in the most recent SemEval Cross-Lingual WSD task (Lefever and Hoste, 2010).",
        "Instead of considering translations as indicators of distinct senses, as was the case in previous tasks, the senses of a small number of ambiguous words were described by manually created clusters of translations.",
        "We consider that the sense cluster inventories created by the unsupervised WSI method proposed by Apidianaki (2008) would be useful in other applicative contexts as well and, especially, in CLLS.",
        "In unsupervised cross-lingual WSD, the clusters constitute the candidate senses from which one has to be selected for each new instance of the words in context.",
        "So, when an instance of a word is disambiguated, a cluster of semantically related translations is selected on the basis of the source context describing its sense.",
        "This is exactly the goal of CLLS, as described in the relevant task set up in SemEval-2010, where the systems had to provide for instances of words in context, several possible translations in another language (Sinha et al., 2009; Mihalcea et al., 2010).",
        "It seems thus that CLLS constitutes a suitable field for exploiting this sense clustering method and, in what follows, we will try to evaluate this assumption."

        "This scorer allows duplicates which means that systems can get inflated scores (i.e. > 100), as the credit for each item is not divided by the number of substitutes and the frequency of each annotator response is used.",
        "Allowing duplicates permits that the systems boost their scores with duplicates on translations with higher probability.",
        "Two baselines are used for evaluation: a dictionary-based one (DICT), which contains the Spanish translations of all target words provided by an SP-EN dictionary, and a dictionary and corpus-based one (DICTCORP), where the translations provided by the dictionary for a given target word are ranked according to their frequencies in the Spanish Wikipedia.",
        "In DICT, the best baseline is produced by taking the first translation provided by the dictionary while the oot baseline considers the first ten translations.",
        "In order to evaluate our WSD method, we proceed as follows.",
        "If the cluster selected by the WSD method contains ten translations (or more), all the translations are given in the oot results.",
        "Otherwise, the translations found in the cluster are proposed and the most frequent translation is duplicated till reaching ten elements.",
        "For best, we always retain the most frequent translation of the selected cluster.",

        "Our method (denoted by 'WSD' in the table) outperforms the 14 systems that participated in the CLLS task as well as the recall (R) and precision (P) baselines.",
        "It is important to note that, contrary to our method which is totally unsupervised, all the systems that participated in the SemEval-2010 task used predefined resources.",
        "The second ranked system (SWAT-E), for instance, performs lexical substitution in English and then translates each substitute into Spanish using two predefined bilingual dictionaries, while SWATS does the inverse, performing lexical substitution in the translated text (Wicentowski et al., 2010).",
        "Another interesting point is that the sense cluster inventory used by the cross-lingual WSD method is derived from Europarl, which is the European Parliament Proceedings parallel corpus (Koehn, 2005).",

        "A conclusion that can be drawn is that each subtask has different requirements, which may be satisfied by different types of methods.",

        "Especially in the best subtask, where the method seemed to perform worse than the other systems, the recall and precision scores obtained for adjectives (with and without mode) are higher than those obtained by the highest-ranked system (cf. Table 4) and much higher than the baselines.",
        "A more detailed look at the obtained results proved that the most frequent translation of the English adjectives in our training corpus proposed in the best evaluation subtask and emphasized in the oot subtask - is often the most frequent translation proposed by the annotators.",
        "This is not the case for the other POS, where the most frequent translation in the corpus often does not correspond to the annotators' first choice.",
        "Furthermore, the translation proposed by the system is not the same as the most frequent translation of the word in the general dictionary and the Spanish Wikipedia which were used, respectively, for the DICT and DICT-CORP baselines.",
