        "This is supposed to simulate spoken language.",
        "Once the punctuation is removed all sequences of length 10 or less are used for most approaches in unsupervised parsing.",
        "This ensures that the hypothesis space is relatively small for the sentences left in the corpus.",
        "The same approach is chosen for this paper, as this is the context in which uDOP grammars are most likely to be evaluated.",
        "A slightly different definition of punctuation is used.",
        "Note that no bracketing structure is used.",
        "This means that for every string in the corpus, a number of transitions has to be created that is limited by n in the worst case, were n is the length of the string.",
        "Note that the removal of more punctuation marks will lead to a sample that is harder to reduce in size by determinization and minimization.",
        "Punctuation occurs frequently and can therefore easily net a great number of reductions by merging states.",

        "tag sequences of length 10 or less.",
        "For the Brown Corpus the tags that are removed are specified by the regular expression",
        "Not the whole sample from the Brown Corpus is used.",
        "Instead samples of 5000,10000 and 15000 sequences of tags are used.",
        "The results of the algorithms can be seen in Table 5.",
        "In order to make the comparison implementation independent, the number of transitions after the transformation to subtrees, as explained in section 4, is given.",
        "The results show that the minimization algorithm tends to cut the number of transitions in half for all corpora.",
        "This means these reductions in the number of transitions could be used to double the size of the corpus used in uDOP.ie Note that if one was to extend the corpus with more strings of limited size the benefit of the new approaches should become more pronounced.",
        "This is the case since the deter-minstic construction only introduces one state per observed substring.",
        "The set of possible tag sequences of length 10 or less is limited.",
        "This holds especially true if one considers linguistic constraints.",
        "This tendency can be seen from the statistics for 15000 sentences from the Brown corpus.",
