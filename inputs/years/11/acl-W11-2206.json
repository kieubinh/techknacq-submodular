        "A shrinking fraction of the world's web pages are written in English, while about 3,000 languages are endangered (Krauss, 2007).",
        "Therefore the ability to access information across a range of languages, especially low-density languages, is becoming increasingly important for many applications.",
        "In this paper we hypothesize that in order to extend cross-lingual information access to all the language pairs on the earth, or at least to some low-density languages which are lacking fundamental linguistic resources, we can start from the much more scalable task of \"information\" translation, or more specifically, new name translation.",
        "Wikipedia, as a remarkable and rich online encyclopedia with a wealth of general knowledge about varied concepts, entities, events and facts in the world, may be utilized to address this need.",
        "As of March 2011 Wikipedia contains pages from 275 languages, but statistical machine translation (MT) techniques can only process a small portion of them (e.g. Google translate can only translate between 59 languages).",
        "Wikipedia infoboxes are a highly structured form of data and are composed of a set of subject-attribute-value triples that summarize or highlight the key features of the concept or subject of each article.",
        "A large number of instance-centered knowledge-bases that have harvested this structured data are available.",
        "The most well-known are probably DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007), Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2007) and YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007).",
        "However, almost all of these existing knowledge bases contain only one language.",
        "Even for high-density languages, more than 70% of Wikipedia pages and their infobox entries do not contain cross-lingual links.",
        "Recent research into Knowledge Base Population, the automatic generation of profiles for named entities from unstructured text has raised the possibility of automatic infobox generation in many languages.",
        "Cross-lingual links between entities in this setting would require either expensive multilingual human annotation or automatic name pairing.",
        "We hypothesize that overlaps in information across languages might allow automatic pairing of profiles, without any preexisting translational capabilities.",
        "Wikipedia infoboxes provide a proxy for these high quality cross lingual automatically generated profiles upon which we can explore this hypothesis.",
        "In this paper we propose a simple and general unsupervised approach to discover name translations from knowledge bases in any language pair, using Wikipedia infoboxes as a case study.",
        "Although different languages have different writing systems, a vast majority of the world's countries and languages use similar forms for representing information such as time/calendar date, number, website URL and currency (IBM, 2010).",
        "In fact most languages commonly follow the ISO 8601 standard so the formats of time/date are the same or very similar.",
        "Therefore, we take advantage of this language-independent formatting to design a new and simple bootstrapping based name pair mining approach.",
        "We start from language-independent expressions in any two languages, and then extract those infobox entries which share the same slot values.",
        "The algorithm iteratively mines more name pairs by utilizing these pairs and comparing other slot values.",
        "In this unsupervised manner we don't need to start from any name transliteration module or document-wise temporal distributions as in previous work.",
        "We conduct experiments on English and Chinese as we have bilingual annotators available for evaluating results.",
        "However, our approach does not require any language-specific knowledge so it's generally applicable to any other language pairs.",
        "We also compare our approach to state-of-the-art name translation mining approaches.",
        "is a fixed-format table designed to be added to the top right-hand corner of the article to consistently present a summary of some unifying attributes (or \"slots\") about the entry.",
        "For example, in the Wikipedia entry about the singer \"Beyonce Knowles\", the infobox includes information about her birth date, origin, song genres, occupation, etc.",
        "As of November 2010, there were 10,355,225 English Wikipedia entries, and 772,826 entries.",
        "Only 27.2% of English Wikipedia entries have cross-lingual hyperlinks referring to their corresponding Chinese entries.",
        "Wikipedia entries are created and updated exponentially (Almeida et al., 2007) because of the increasing number of contributors, many of whom are not multilingual speakers.",
        "Therefore it is valuable to align the cross-lingual entries by effective name mining.",
        "A standard Wikipedia entry includes a title, a document describing the entry, and an \"infobox\" which",
        "Figure 1 depicts a motivating example for our approach.",
        "Based on the assumption that if two person entries had the same birth date and death date, they are likely to be the same person, we can find the entity pair of (Michael Jackson / S^^-^^M).",
        "We can get many name pairs using similar language-independent clues.",
        "Then starting from these name pairs, we can iteratively get new pairs with a large portion of overlapped slots.",
        "For example, since \"f£BfIIAt§\" and \"The Jackson 5\" share many slot values such as 'member' and 'years active', they are likely to be a translation pair.",
        "Next we can use the new pair of (The Jackson 5 / IRBflïÀâÊl) to mine more pairs such as \"lÄDIJn \" and \"Steeltown Records.\""

        "However, most of these approaches needed large amount of seeds and suffered from information extraction errors, and thus relied on phonetic similarity or document similarity to re-score candidate name translation pairs.",

        "In this paper we described a simple, cheap and effective self-boosting approach to mine name translation pairs from Wikipedia infoboxes.",
        "This method is implemented in a completely unsupervised fashion, without using any manually created seed set, training data, transliteration or pre-knowledge about the language pair.",
        "The underlying motivation is that some certain expressions, such as numbers and dates, are written in language-independent forms among a large majority of languages.",
        "Therefore our approach can be applied to any language pairs including low-density languages as long as they share a small set of such expressions.",
        "Experiments on English-Chinese pair showed that this approach is able to mine thousands of name pairs with more than 85% accuracy.",
        "In addition the resulting name pairs can be used to significantly augment the results from existing approaches.",
        "The mined name pairs are made publicly available.",
        "In the future we will apply our method to mine other entity types from more language pairs.",
        "We will also extend our name discovery method to all infobox pairs, not just those that can be mapped into KBP-like slots.",
        "As a bi-product, our method can be used for automatic cross-lingual Wikipedia page linking, as well as unsupervised translation lexicon extraction, although this might require confidence estimates on the translations learned.",
        "Once our approach is applied to a panlingual setting (most languages on the Wikipedia), we can also utilize the voting results across multiple languages to automatically validate information or correct potential errors in Wikipedia infoboxes.",
        "Finally, as automatic name profile generation systems are generated cross-lingually, our method could be attempted to automatic cross-lingual mappings between entities.",
