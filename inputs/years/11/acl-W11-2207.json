        "There is high demand for automated tools that assign polarity to microblog content such as tweets (Twitter posts), but this is challenging due to the terseness and informality of tweets in addition to the wide variety and rapid evolution of language in Twitter.",
        "It is thus impractical to use standard supervised machine learning techniques dependent on annotated training examples.",
        "We do without such annotations by using label propagation to incorporate labels from a maximum entropy classifier trained on noisy labels and knowledge about word types encoded in a lexicon, in combination with the Twitter follower graph.",
        "Results on polarity classification for several datasets show that our label propagation approach rivals a model supervised with in-domain annotated tweets, and it outperforms the noisily supervised classifier it exploits as well as a lexicon-based polarity ratio classifier."

        "Twitter is a microblogging service where users post messages (\"tweets\") of no more than 140 characters.",
        "With around 200 million users generating 140 million tweets per day, Twitter represents one of the largest and most dynamic datasets of user generated content.",
        "Along with other social networking websites such as Facebook, the content on Twitter is real time: tweets about everything from a friend's birthday to a devastating earthquake can be found posted during and immediately after an event in question.",
        "This vast stream of real time data has major implications for any entity interested in public opin-",
        "Nikita Sudan",
        "Jason Baldridge",
        "Companies have the opportunity to examine what customers and potential customers are saying about their products and services without costly and time-consuming surveys or explicit requests for feedback.",
        "Political organizations and candidates might be able to determine what issues the public is most interested in, as well as where they stand on those issues.",
        "Manual inspection of tweets can be useful for many such analyses, but many applications and questions require realtime analysis of massive amounts of social media content.",
        "Computational tools that automatically extract and analyze relevant information about opinion expressed on Twitter and other social media sources are thus in high demand.",
        "Full sentiment analysis for a given question or topic requires many stages, including but not limited to: (1) extraction of tweets based on an initial query, (2) filtering out spam and irrelevant items from those tweets, (3) identifying subjective tweets, and (4) identifying the polarity of those tweets.",
        "Like most work in sentiment analysis, we focus on the last stage, polarity classification.",
        "The simplest approaches are based on the presence of words or emoticons that are indicators of positive or negative polarity (e.g. Twitter's own API, O'Connor et al.",
        "(2010)), or calculating a ratio of positive to negative terms (Choi and Cardie, 2009).",
        "Though these are a useful first pass, the nuance of language often defeats them (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "Tweets provide additional challenges compared to edited text; e.g. they are short and include informal/colloquial/abbreviated language.",
        "Standard supervised classification methods improve the situation somewhat (Pang et al., 2002), but these require texts labeled with polarity as input and they do not adapt to changes in language use.",
        "One way around this is to use noisy labels (also referred to as \"distant supervision\"), e.g. by taking emoticons like ':)' as positive and ':(' as negative, and train a standard classifier (Read, 2005; Go et al., 2009).",
        "Semi-supervised methods can also reduce dependence on labeled texts: for example, Sindhwani and Melville (2008) use a polarity lexicon combined with label propagation.",
        "Several have used label propagation starting with a small number of hand-labeled words to induce a lexicon for use in polarity classification (Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2008; Rao and Ravichandran, 2009; Brody and Elhadad, 2010).",
        "In this paper, we bring together several of the above approaches via label propagation using modified adsorption (Talukdar and Crammer, 2009).",
        "This also allows us to explore the possibility of exploiting the Twitter follower graph to improve polarity classification, under the assumption that people influence one another or have shared affinities about topics.",
        "We construct a graph that has users, tweets, word unigrams, word bigrams, hashtags, and emoti-cons as its nodes; users are connected based on the Twitter follower graph, users are connected to the tweets they created, and tweets are connected to the unigrams, bigrams, hashtags and emoticons they contain.",
        "We seed the graph using the polarity values in the OpinionFinder lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005), the known polarity of emoticons, and a maximum entropy classifier trained on 1.8 million tweets with automatically assigned labels based on the presence of positive and negative emoticons, like Read (2005) and Go et al.",
        "(2009).",
        "We compare the label propagation approach to the noisily supervised classifier itself and to a standard lexicon-based method using positive/negative ratios.",
        "Evaluation is performed on several datasets of tweets that have been annotated for polarity: the Stanford Twitter Sentiment set (Go et al., 2009), tweets from the 2008 debate between Obama and McCain (Shamma et al., 2009), and a new dataset of tweets about health care reform that we have created.",
        "In addition to performing standard per-tweet accuracy, we also measure per-target accuracy (for health care reform) and an aggregate error metric over all users in our test set that captures how similar predicted positivity of each user is to their actual positivity.",
        "Across all datasets and measures, we find that label propagation is consistently better than the noisily supervised classifier, which in turn outperforms the lexicon-based method.",
        "Additionally, for the health care reform dataset, the label propagation approach – which uses no gold labeled tweets, just a hand-created lexicon – outperforms a maximum entropy classifier trained on gold labels.",
        "However, we do not find the follower graph to improve performance with our current implementation."

        "We have improved upon existing tweet polarity classification methods by combining several knowledge sources with a noisily supervised label propagation algorithm.",
        "We show that a maximum entropy classifier trained with distant supervision works better than a lexicon-based ratio predictor, improving the accuracy for polarity classification on our held-out test set from 58.1% to 62.9%.",
        "By using the predictions of that classifier in combination with a graph that incorporates tweets and lexical features, we obtain even better accuracy of 71.2%.",
        "We did not find overall gains from using the follower graph as implemented here.",
        "There is room for improvement in the way the follower graph is encoded in our graph, particularly with respect to using asymmetric relationships rather than an undirected graph, and in how follower relationships are weighted.",
        "Another source of information that could be used to improve results is the text in pages that have been linked to from a tweet.",
        "in many cases, it is only possible to know what the polarity is by looking at the page being linked to.",
        "Our label propagation setup can incorporate this straightforwardly by adding nodes for those pages plus edges between them and all tweets that reference them."
