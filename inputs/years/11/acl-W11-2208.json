        "This paper considers unsupervised learning of linguistic structure – specifically, parts of speech – in parallel text data.",
        "This setting, and more generally the multilingual learning scenario, has been found advantageous for a variety of unsupervised NLP tasks (Snyder et al., 2008; Cohen and Smith, 2010; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010; Das and Petrov, 2011).",
        "We consider globally normalized Markov random fields (MRFs) as an alternative to directed models based on multinomial distributions or locally normalized log-linear distributions.",
        "This alternate parameterization allows us to introduce correlated features that, at least in principle, depend on any parts of the hidden structure.",
        "Such models, sometimes called \"undirected,\" are widespread in supervised NLP; the most notable instances are conditional random fields (Lafferty et al., 2001), which have enabled rich feature engineering to incorporate knowledge and improve performance.",
        "We conjecture that the \"features view\" of NLP problems is also more appropriate in unsupervised settings than the contrived, acyclic causal stories required by directed models.",
        "Indeed, as we will discuss below, previous work on multilingual POS induction has had to resort to objectionable independence assumptions to avoid introducing cyclic dependencies in the causal network.",
        "While undirected models are formally attractive, they are computationally demanding, particularly when they are used generatively, i.e., as joint distributions over input and output spaces.",
        "Inference and learning algorithms for these models are usually intractable on realistic datasets, so we must resort to approximations.",
        "Our emphasis here is primarily on the machinery required to support overlapping features, not on weakening independence assumptions, although we weaken them slightly.",
        "Specifically, our parameterization permits us to model the relationship between aligned words in any configuration, rather than just those that conform to an acyclic generative process, as previous work in this area has done (§2).",
        "We incorporate word prefix and suffix features (up to four characters) in an undirected version of a model designed by Snyder et al.",
        "(2008).",

        "The task of unsupervised bilingual POS induction was originally suggested and explored by Snyder et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "Their work proposes a joint model over pairs of tag sequences and words that can be understood as a pair of hidden Markov models (HMMs) in which aligned words share states (a fixed and observable word alignment is assumed).",
        "Figure 1 gives an example for a French-English sentence pair.",
        "Following Goldwater and Griffiths (2007), the transition, emission and coupling parameters are governed by Dirichlet priors, and a token-level collapsed Gibbs sampler is used for inference.",
        "The hyperparameters of the prior distributions are inferred from data in an empirical Bayesian fashion.",
        "When word alignments are monotonic (i.e., there are no crossing links in the alignment graph), the model of Snyder et al.",
        "is straightforward to construct.",
        "However, crossing alignment links pose a problem: they induce cycles in the tag sequence graph, which corresponds to an ill-defined probability model.",
        "Their solution is to eliminate such alignment pairs (their algorithm for doing so is discussed below).",
        "Unfortunately, this is a potentially a serious loss of information.",
        "Crossing alignments often correspond to systematic word order differences between languages (e.g., SVO vs. SOV languages).",
        "As such, leaving them out prevents useful information about entire subsets of POS types from exploiting of bilingual context.",
        "In the monolingual setting, Smith and Eisner (2005) showed similarly that a POS induction model can be improved with spelling features (prefixes and suffixes of words), and Haghighi and Klein (2006) describe an MRF-based monolingual POS induction model that uses features.",
        "An example of such a monolingual model is shown in Figure 2.",
        "Both papers developed different approximations of the computationally expensive partition function.",
        "Haghighi and Klein (2006) approximated by ignoring all sentences of length greater than some maximum, and the \"contrastive estimation\" of Smith and Eisner (2005) approximates the partition function with a set of automatically distorted training examples which are compactly represented in WFSTs.",
        "Das and Petrov (2011) also consider the problem of unsupervised bilingual POS induction.",
        "They make use of independent conventional HMM monolingual tagging models that are parameterized with feature-rich log-linear models (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010).",
        "However, training is constrained with tag dictionaries inferred using bilingual contexts derived from aligned parallel data.",
        "In this way, the complex inference and modeling challenges associated with a bilingual tagging model are avoided.",
        "Finally, multilingual POS induction has also been considered without using parallel data.",
        "Cohen et al.",
        "(2011) present a multilingual estimation technique for part-of-speech tagging (and grammar induction), where the lack of parallel data is compensated by the use of labeled data for some languages and unla-beled data for other languages."
