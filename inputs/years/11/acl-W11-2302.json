        "Through simple evaluations of intelligibility with na√Øve listeners, we show that the correction of phoneme errors results in the greatest increase in intelligibility and is therefore a desirable mechanism for the eventual creation of augmentative application software for individuals with dysarthria."

        "Dysarthria is a set of neuromotor disorders that impair the physical production of speech.",
        "These impairments reduce the normal control of the primary vocal articulators but do not affect the regular comprehension or production of meaningful, syntactically correct language.",
        "For example, damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve reduces control of vocal fold vibration (i.e., phonation), which can result in aberrant voicing.",
        "Inadequate control of soft palate movement caused by disruption of the vagus cranial nerve may lead to a disproportionate amount of air being released through the nose during speech (i.e., hypernasality).",
        "The lack of articulatory control also leads to various involuntary non-speech sounds including velopharyngeal or glottal noise (Rosen and Yampolsky, 2000).",
        "More commonly, a lack of tongue and lip dexterity often produces heavily slurred speech and a more diffuse and less differentiable vowel target space (Kent and Rosen, 2004).",
        "The neurological damage that causes dysarthria usually affects other physical activity as well which can have a drastically adverse affect on mobility and computer interaction.",
        "For instance, severely dysarthric speakers are 150 to 300 times slower than typical users in keyboard interaction (Hosom et al., 2003; Hux et al., 2000).",
        "However, since dysarthric speech is often only 10 to 17 times slower than that of typical speakers (Patel, 1998), speech is a viable input modality for computer-assisted interaction.",
        "Consider a dysarthric individual who must travel into a city by public transportation.",
        "This might involve purchasing tickets, asking for directions, or indicating intentions to fellow passengers, all within a noisy and crowded environment.",
        "A personal portable communication device in this scenario (either hand-held or attached to a wheelchair) would transform relatively unintelligible speech spoken into a microphone to make it more intelligible before being played over a set of speakers.",
        "Such a system could facilitate interaction and overcome difficult or failed attempts at communication in daily life.",
        "We propose a system that avoids drawbacks of other voice-output communication aids that output only synthetic speech.",
        "Before software for such a device is designed, our goal is to establish and evaluate a set of modifications to dysarthric speech to produce a more intelligible equivalent.",
        "Understanding the utility of each of these techniques will be crucial to effectively designing the proposed system."

        "Command vocabularies consisted of very simple phrases (e.g., \"TV channel up\", \"Radio volume down\") and feedback was provided to the user either by visual displays or by auditory cues.",
        "This speech-based environmental control was compared with a 'scanning' interface in which a button is physically pressed to iteratively cycle through a list of alternative commands, words, or phrases.",
        "While the speech interface made more errors (between 90.8% and 100% accuracy after training) than the scanning interface (100% accuracy), the former was significantly faster (7.7s vs 16.9s, on average).",
        "Participants commented that speech was significantly less tiring than the scanning interface, and just as subjectively appealing (Hawley et al., 2007).",
        "Similar results were obtained in other comparisons of speech and scanning interfaces (Havstam, Buchholz, and Hartelius, 2003), and command-and-control systems (Green et al., 2003).",
        "Speech is a desirable method of expression for individuals with dysarthria.",
        "There are many augmentative communication devices that employ synthetic text-to-speech in which messages can be written on a specialized keyboard or played back from a repository of pre-recorded phrases (Messina and Messina, 2007).",
        "This basic system architecture can be modified to allow for the replacement of textual input with spoken input.",
        "However, such a scenario would involve some degree of automatic speech recognition, which is still susceptible to fault despite recent advances (Rudzicz, 2011).",
        "Moreover, the type of synthetic speech output produced by such systems often lacks a sufficient degree of individual affectation or natural expression that one might expect in typical human speech (Kain et al., 2007).",
        "The use of prosody to convey personal information such as one's emotional state is generally not supported by such systems but is nevertheless a key part of a general communicative ability.",
        "Transforming one's speech in a way that preserves the natural prosody will similarly also preserve extralinguistic information such as emotions, and is therefore a pertinent response to the limitations of current technology.",
        "Kain et al.",
        "(2007) proposed the voice transformation system shown in figure 1 which produced output speech by concatenating together original unvoiced segments with synthesized voiced segments that consisted of a superposition of the original high-bandwidth signal with synthesized low-bandwidth formants.",
        "These synthesized formants were produced by modifications to input energy, pitch generation, and formant modifications.",
        "Modifications to energy and formants were performed by Gaussian mixture mapping, as described below, in which learned relationships between dysarthric and target acoustics were used to produce output closer to the target space.",
        "This process was intended to be automated, but Kain et al.",
        "(2007) performed extensive hand-tuning and manually identified formants in the input.",
        "This will obviously be impossible in a real-time system, but these processes can to some extent be automated.",
        "For example, voicing boundaries can be identified by the weighted combination of various acoustic features (e.g., energy, zero-crossing rate) (Kida and Kawa-hara, 2005; Hess, 2008), and formants can be identified by the Burg algorithm (Press et al., 1992) or through simple linear predictive analysis with continuity constraints on the identified resonances between adjacent frames (O'Shaughnessy, 2008).",
        "Spectral modifications traditionally involve filtering or amplification methods such as spectral subtraction or harmonic filtering (O'Shaughnessy, 2000), but these are not useful for dealing with more serious mispronounciations (e.g., /t/ for /n/).",
        "Ho-som et al.",
        "(2003) showed that Gaussian mixture mapping can be used to transform audio from one set of spectral acoustic features to another.",
        "During analysis, context-independent frames of speech are analyzed for bark-scaled energy and their 24th order cepstral coefficients.",
        "For synthesis, a cepstral analysis approximates the original spectrum, and a high-order linear predictive filter is applied to each frame, and excited by impulses or white noise (for voiced and unvoiced segments).",

        "Currently, these modifications are uniformly preceded by noise reduction using spectral subtraction and either phonological or phonemic annotations.",
        "This latter step is currently necessary, since certain modifications require either knowledge of the manner of articulation or the identities of the vowel segments, as explained below.",
        "The purpose of this exercise is to determine which modifications result in the most significant improvements to intelligibility, so the correct annotation sequence is vital to avoid the introduction of an additional dimension of error.",
        "Therefore, the annotations used below are extracted directly from the professional markup in the TORGO database.",
        "In practice, however, phonemic annotations determined automatically by speech recognition would be imperfect, which is why investigations of this type often forgo that automation altogether (e.g., see Kain et al.",

        "In some cases, the dysarthric speech must be compared or supplemented with another vocal source.",

        "This system is invoked by providing the expected text uttered by the dysarthic speaker.",
        "In order to properly combine this purely synthetic signal and the original waveforms we require identical sampling rates, so we resample the former by a rational factor using a polyphase filter with low-pass filtering to avoid aliasing (Hayes, 1999).",

        "Empirical analysis of TORGO data suggests that for at least two male dysarthric speakers this voice bar extends considerably higher, up to 250 Hz.",
        "In order to correct these mispronunciations, the voice bar is filtered out of all acoustic sub-sequences annotated as unvoiced consonants.",
        "For this task we use a high-pass Butterworth filter, which is \"maximally flat\" in the passband and monotonic in magnitude in the frequency domain (Butterworth, 1930).",
        "Here, this filter is computed on a normalized frequency range respecting the Nyquist frequency, so that if a waveform's sampling rate is 16 kHz, the normalized cutoff frequency for this component is f*Norm = 250/(1.6 x 10/2) = 3.125 x 10-2.",
        "The Butterworth filter is an all-pole transfer function between signals, and we use the 10th-order low-pass",
        "Butterworth filter whose magnitude response is where z is the complex frequency in polar coordinates and z*Norm is the cutoff frequency in that domain (Hayes, 1999).",
        "This allows the transfer function whose poles occur at known symmetric intervals around the unit complex-domain circle (Butterworth, 1930).",
        "These poles are then transformed by the Matlab function zp2ss, which produces the state-space coefficients ai and √üi that describe the output signal resulting from applying the low-pass Butterworth filter to the discrete signal x[n].",
        "These coefficients are further converted by giving the high-pass Butterworth filter with the same cutoff frequency of zNNorm.",
        "This continuous system is converted to the discrete equivalent through the impulse-invariant discretization method and is implemented by the difference equation",
        "As previously mentioned, this equation is applied to each acoustic subsequence annotated as unvoiced consonants, thereby smoothly removing the energy below 250 Hz.",
        "The Levenshtein algorithm finds a best possible alignment of the phoneme sequence in actually uttered speech and the expected phoneme sequence, given the known word sequence.",
        "Isolating phoneme insertions and deletions are therefore a simple matter of iteratively adjusting the source speech according to that alignment.",
        "There are two cases where action is required:",
        "insertion error In this case a phoneme is present where it ought not be.",
        "In the TORGO database, these insertion errors tend to be repetitions of phonemes occurring in the first syllable of a word, according to the International Speech Lexicon Dictionary (Hasegawa-Johnson and Fleck, 2007).",
        "When an insertion error is identified the entire associated segment of the signal is simply removed.",
        "In the case that the associated segment is not surrounded by silence, adjacent phonemes can be merged together with time-domain pitch-synchronous overlap-add (Moulines and Charpentier, 1990).",
        "deletion error The vast majority of accidentally deleted phonemes in the TORGO database are fricatives, affricates, and plosives.",
        "Often, these involve not properly pluralizing nouns (e.g., book instead of books).",
        "Given their high preponderance of error, these phonemes are the only ones we insert into the dysarthric source speech.",
        "Specifically, when the deletion of a phoneme is recognized with the Levenshtein algorithm, we simply extract the associated segment from the aligned synthesized speech and insert it into the appropriate spot in the dysarthric speech.",
        "For all unvoiced fricatives, affricates, and plosives no further action is required.",
        "When these phonemes are voiced, however, we first extract and remove the F0 curve from the synthetic speech, linearly interpolate the F0 curve from adjacent phonemes in the source dysarthric speech, and resynthesize with the synthetic spectrum and interpolated F0.",
        "If interpolation is not possible (e.g., the synthetic voiced phoneme is to be inserted beside an unvoiced phoneme), we simply generate a flat F0equal to the nearest natural F0 curve.",
        "Figure 3 exemplifies that vowels uttered by dysarthric speakers are significantly slower than those uttered by typical speakers.",
        "In fact, sonorants can be twice as long in dysarthric speech, on average (Rudzicz, Namasivayam, and Wolff, 2011).",

        "Since we wish to contract the length of a signal segment here without affecting its pitch or frequency characteristics, we use a phase vocoder based on digital short-time Fourier analysis (Portnoff, 1976).",
        "Here, Hamming-windowed segments of the source phoneme are analyzed with a z-transform giving both frequency and phase estimates for up to 2048 frequency bands.",
        "During pitch-preserving time-scaled warping, we specify the magnitude spectrum directly from the input magnitude spectrum with phase values chosen to ensure continuity (Sethares, 2007).",
        "Specifically, for the frequency band at frequency F and frames j and k > j in the modified spectrogram, the phase 9 is predicted by",
        "In our case the discrete warping of the spectrogram involves simple decimation by a constant factor.",
        "The spectrogram is then converted into a time-domain signal modified in tempo but not in pitch relative to the original phoneme segment.",
        "This conversion is accomplished simply through the inverse Fourier transform.",
        "Formant trajectories inform the listener as to the identities of vowels, but the vowel space of dysarthric speakers tends to be constrained (Kain et al., 2007).",
        "In order to improve a listener's ability to differentiate between the vowels, this modification component identifies formant trajectories in the acoustics and modifies these according to the known vowel identity of a segment.",
        "Here, formants are identified with a 14th-order linear-predictive coder with continuity constraints on the identified resonances between adjacent frames (Snell and Milinazzo, 1993; O'Shaughnessy, 2008).",
        "Band-widths are determined by the negative natural logarithm of the pole magnitude, as implemented in the STRAIGHT analysis system (Banno et al., 2007; Kawahara, 2006).",
        "For each identified vowel in the dysarthric speech, formant candidates are identified at each frame in time up to 5 kHz.",
        "Only those time frames having at least 3 such candidates within 250 Hz of expected values are considered.",
        "The expected values of formants are derived from analyses performed by Allen et al.",
        "(1987).",
        "Given these subsets of candidate time frames in the vowel, the one having the highest spectral energy within the middle 50% of the length of the vowel is established as the anchor position, and the three formant candidates within the expected ranges are established as the anchor frequencies for formants F1 to F3.",
        "If more than one formant candidate falls within expected ranges, the one with the lowest bandwidth becomes the anchor frequency.",
        "Given identified anchor points and target sonorant-specific frequencies and bandwidths, there are several methods to modify the spectrum.",
        "The most common may be to learn a statistical conversion function based on Gaussian mixture mapping, as described earlier, typically preceded by alignment of sequences using dynamic time warping morphing implemented by Kawahara and Matsui (2003), among others.",

        "Tolba and Torgoman (2009) claimed that significant improvements in automatic recognition of dysarthric speech are attainable by modifying formants F1 and F2 to be more similar to expected values.",
        "In that study, formants were identified using standard linear predictive coding techniques, although no information was provided as to how these formants were modified nor how their targets were determined.",
        "However, they claimed that modified dysarthric speech resulted in 'recognition rates' (by which they presumably meant word-accuracy) of 71.4% in the HTK speech recognition system, as compared with 28% on the unmodified dysarthric speech from 7 individuals.",
        "The results in section 4 show that human listeners are more likely to correctly identify utterances in which phoneme insertion and deletion errors are corrected than those in which formant frequencies are adjusted.",
        "Therefore, one might hypothesize that such preprocessing might provide even greater gains than those reported by Tolba and Torgoman (2009).",
        "Ongoing work ought to confirm or deny this hypothesis.",
        "A prototypical client-based application based on our research for unrestricted speech transformation of novel sentences is currently in development.",
        "Such work will involve improving factors such as accuracy and accessibility for individuals whose neuro-motor disabilities limit the use of modern speech recognition, and for whom alternative interaction modalities are insufficient.",
        "This application is being developed under the assumption that it will be used in a mobile device embeddable within a wheelchair.",
        "If word-prediction is to be incorporated, the predicted continuations of uttered sentence fragments can be synthesized without requiring acoustic input.",
        "In practice, the modifications presented here will have to be based on automatically-generated annotations of the source audio.",
        "This is especially important to the 'splicing' module in which word-identification is crucial.",
        "There are a number of techniques that can be exercised in this area.",
        "Czyzewski, Kaczmarek, and Kostek (2003) apply both a variety of neural networks and rough sets to the task of classifying segments of speech according to the presence of stop-gaps, vowel prolongations, and incorrect syllable repetitions.",
        "In each case, input includes source waveforms and detected formant frequencies.",
        "They found that stopgaps and vowel prolongations could be detected with up to 97.2% accuracy and that vowel repetitions could be detected with up to 90% accuracy using the rough set method.",
        "Accuracy was similar although slightly lower using traditional neural networks (Czyzewski, Kacz-marek, and Kostek, 2003).",
        "These results appear generally invariant even under frequency modifications to the source speech.",
        "Arbisi-Kelm (2010), for example, suggest that disfluent repetitions can be identified reliably through the use of pitch, duration, and pause detection (with precision up to 93% (Nakatani, 1993)).",
        "If more traditional models of speech recognition are to be deployed to identify vowels, the probabilities that they generate across hypothesized words might be used to weight the manner in which acoustic transformations are made.",
        "The use of one's own voice to communicate is a desirable goal, and continuations of this research are therefore focused on the practical aspects of this research towards usable and portable systems."
