        "This section provides an overview of our implemented method for identifying the intended message of a line graph.",
        "In processing a line graph, a visual extraction module first analyzes the image file and produces an XML representation which fully specifies the graphic (including the beginning and ending points of each segment, any annotations on points, axis labels, the caption, etc.).",
        "To identify the intended message of a line graph consisting of many short, jagged segments, we must generalize it into a sequence of visually-distinguishable trends.",
        "This is performed by a graph segmentation module which uses a support vector machine and a variety of attributes (including statistical tests) to produce a model that transforms the graphic into a sequence of straight lines representing visually-distinguishable trends.",
        "For example, the line graph in Figure 1 is divided into a stable trend from 1900 to 1930 and a rising trend from 1930 to 2003.",
        "Similarly, the line graph in Figure 2 is divided into a rising trend from",
        "Declining Durango sales",
        "Figure 2: From \"Chrysler: Plant had $800 million impact\" in The (Wilmington) News Journal, Feb 15, 2007.",
        "1997 to 1999 and a falling trend from 1999 to 2006.",
        "In analyzing a corpus of around 100 line graphs collected from several popular media sources, we identified 10 intended message categories (including rising-trend, change-trend, change-trend-return, and big-jump, etc.",
        "), that seem to capture the kinds of high-level messages conveyed by line graphs.",
        "A suggestion generation module uses the sequence of trends identified in the line graph to construct all of its possible candidate messages in these message categories.",
        "For example, if a graph contains three trends, several candidate messages are constructed, including two change-trend messages (one for each adjacent pair of trends), a change-trend-return message if the first and third trends are of the same type (rising, falling, or stable), as well as a rising, falling, or stable trend message for each individual trend.",
        "Next, various communicative signals are extracted from the graphic, including visual features (such as a point annotated with its value) that draw attention to a particular part of the line graph, and linguistic clues (such as the presence of certain words in the caption) that suggest a particular intended message category.",
        "Figure 2 contains several such signals, including two annotated points and the word declining in its caption.",
        "Next, a Bayesian network is built to estimate the probability of the candidate messages; the extracted communicative signals serve as evidence for or against each candidate message.",
        "For Figure 2, our system produces change-trend(1997, rise, 1999, fall, 2006) as the logical representation of the most probable intended message.",
        "Since the dependent axis is often not explicitly labeled, a series of heuristics are used to identify an appropriate referent, which we term the measurement axis descriptor.",
        "In Figure 2, the measurement axis descriptor is identified as durango sales.",

      "text": [
        "In presenting a multimodal document to a user via a screen reader, if the author does not specify a reading order in the accessibility preferences, it is not entirely clear where the description of the graphical content should be given.",
        "The text of scientific articles normally makes explicit references to any graphs contained in the document; in this case, it makes sense to insert the graphical description alongside the first such reference.",
        "However, popular media articles rarely contain explicit references to graphics.",
        "We hypothesize that describing the graphical content together with the most relevant portion of the article text will result in a more coherent presentation.",
        "Results of an experiment described in Section 3.3 suggest the paragraph which is geographically closest to the graphic is very often not relevant.",
        "Thus, our task becomes identifying the portion of the text that is most relevant to the graph.",
        "We have developed a method for identifying the most relevant paragraph by measuring the similarity between the graphic's textual components and the content of each individual paragraph in the document.",
        "An information graphic's textual components may consist of a title, caption, and any additional descriptions it contains (e.g., the five lines of text in Figure 1 beneath the caption Ocean levels rising).",
        "An initial method (P-KL) based on KL divergence measures the similarity between a paragraph and the graphic's textual component; a second method (P-KLA) is an extension of the first that incorporates an augmented version of the textual component.",
        "Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence (Kullback, 1968) is widely used to measure the similarity between two language models.",
        "It can be expressed as:",
        "where i is the index of a word in vocabulary V, and p and q are two distributions of words.",
        "Liu et al.",
        "(Liu and Croft, 2002) applied KL divergence to text passages in order to improve the accuracy of document retrieval.",
        "For our task, p is a smoothed word distribution built from the line graph's textual component, and q is another smoothed word distribution built from a paragraph in the article text.",
        "Smoothing addresses the problem of zero occurrences of a word in the distributions.",
        "We rank the paragraphs by their KL divergence scores from lowest to highest, since lower scores indicate a higher similarity.",
        "In analyzing paragraphs relevant to the graphics, we realized that they included words that were germane to describing information graphics in general, but not related to the domains of individual graphs.",
        "This led us to build a set of \"expansion words\" that tend to appear in paragraphs relevant to information graphics.",
        "If we could identify domain-independent terms that were correlated with information graphics in general, these expansion words could then be added to the textual component of a graphic when measuring its similarity to a paragraph in the article text.",
        "We constructed the expansion word set using an iterative process.",
        "The first step is to use P-KL to identify m pseudo-relevant paragraphs in the corresponding document for each graphic in the training set (the current implementation uses m = 3).",
        "This is similar to pseudo-relevance feedback used in IR (Zhai, 2008), except only a single query is used in the IR application, whereas we consider many pairs of graphics and documents to obtain an expansion set applicable to any subsequent information graphic.",
        "Given n graphics in the training set, we identify (up to) m * n relevant paragraphs.",
        "The second step is to extract a set of words related to information graphics from these m * n paragraphs.",
        "We assume the collection of pseudo-relevant paragraphs was generated by two models, one producing words relevant to the information graphics and another producing words relevant to the topics of the individual documents.",
        "Let Wg represent the word frequency vector yielding words relevant to the graphics, Wa represent the word frequency vector yielding words relevant to the document topics, and Wp represent the word frequency vector of the pseudo-relevant paragraphs.",
        "We compute Wp from the pseudo-relevant paragraphs themselves, and we estimate Wa using the word frequencies from the article text in the documents.",
        "Finally, we compute Wg by filtering-out the components of Wa from Wp.",
        "This process is related to the work by Widdows (2003) on orthogonal negation of vector spaces.",
        "The task can be formulated as follows:",
        "1.",
        "Wp = aWa + ÃŸWg where a > 0 and ÃŸ > 0, which means the word frequency vector for the pseudo-relevant paragraphs is a linear combination of the background (topic) word frequency vector and the graphic word vector.",
        "2.",
        "< Wa, Wg >= 0 which means the background word vector is orthogonal to the graph description word vector, under the assumption that the graph description word vector is independent of the background word vector and that these two share minimal information.",
        "3.",
        "Wg is assumed to be a unit vector, since we are only interested in the relative rank of the word frequencies, not their actual values.",
        "Solving the above equations, we obtain:",
        "Wg =normalized ^ wp - < Wa> â–  Wa)",
        "After computing Wg, we use WordNet to filter-out words having a predominant sense other than verb or adjective, under the assumption that nouns will be mainly relevant to the domains or topics of the graphs (and are thus \"noise\") whereas we want a general set of words (e.g., \"increasing\") that are typically used when describing the data in any graph.",
        "As a rough estimate of whether a word is predominantly a verb or adjective, we determine whether there are more verb and adjective senses of the word in WordNet than there are noun senses.",
        "Next, we rank the words in the filtered Wg according to frequency and select the k most frequent as our expansion word list (we used k = 25 in our experiments).",
        "The two steps (identifying m*n pseudorelevant paragraphs and then extracting a word list of size k to expand the graphics' textual components) are applied iteratively until convergence occurs or minimal changes are observed between iterations.",
        "In addition, parameters of the intended message that represent points on the x-axis capture domain-specific content of the graphic's communicative goal.",
        "For example, the intended message of the line graph in Figure 1 conveys a changing trend from 1900 to 2003 with the change occurring in 1930.",
        "To help identify relevant paragraphs mentioning these years, we also add these parameters of the intended message to the augmented word list.",
        "The result of this process is the final expansion word list used in method P-KLA.",
        "Because the textual component may be even shorter than the expansion word list, we do not add a word from the expansion word list to the textual component unless the paragraph being compared also contains this word.",
        "334 training graphs with their accompanying articles were used to build the expansion word set.",
        "A separate set of 66 test graphs and articles was analyzed by two human annotators who identified the paragraphs in each document that were most relevant to its associated information graphic, ranking them in terms of relevance.",
        "On average, annotator 1 selected 2.00 paragraphs and annotator 2 selected 1.71 paragraphs.",
        "The annotators agreed on the top ranked paragraph for only 63.6% of the graphs.",
        "Considering the agreement by chance, we can calculate the kappa statistic as 0.594.",
        "This fact shows that the most relevant paragraph is not necessarily obvious and multiple plausible options may exist.",
        "We applied both P-KL and P-KLA to the test set, with each method producing a list of the paragraphs ranked by relevance.",
        "Since our goal is to provide the summary of the graphic at a suitable point in the article text, two evaluation criteria are appropriate:",
        "1.",
        "TOP: the method's success rate in selecting the most relevant paragraph, measured as how often it chooses the paragraph ranked highest by either of the annotators",
        "2.",
        "COVERED: the method's success rate in selecting a relevant paragraph, measured as how often it chooses one of the relevant paragraphs identified by the annotators",
        "Table 1 provides the success rates of both of our methods for the TOP and COVERED criteria, along with a simple baseline that selected the paragraph geographically-closest to the graphic.",
        "These results show that both methods outperform the baseline, and that P-KLA further improves on P-KL.",
        "P-KLA selects the best paragraph in 60.6% of test cases, and selects a relevant paragraph in 71.2% of the cases.",
        "For both TOP and COVERED, P-KLA nearly doubles the baseline success rate.",
        "The improvement of P-KLA over P-KL suggests that our expansion set successfully adds salient words to the textual component.",
        "A one-sided Z-test for proportion based on binomial distribution is shown in Table 1 and indicates that the improvements of P-KL over the baseline and P-KLA over P-KL are statistically-significant at the 0.05 level across both criteria.",
        "The Z-test is calculated as:",
        "where po is the lower result and p is the improved result.",

        "Doing so likely would require the company to bring in a new model.",

        "We collected a corpus of 965 human-written summaries for 23 different line graphs to discover which propositions were deemed most salient under varied conditions.",
        "Subjects received an initial description of the graph's intended message, and were asked to write additional sentences capturing the most important information conveyed by the graph.",

        "Weights for type-1 rules were based on the frequency with which the proposition appeared in summaries for graphs in this category.",
        "Type-2 (visual feature-only) rules were built when there was a correlation between a visual feature and the use of a proposition describing that feature, regardless of the graph's message category (e.g., mention whether the graph is highly volatile).",

        "For propositions associated with visual features linked to a particular message category (e.g., describe the trend immediately following a big-jump or big-fall when it terminates prior to the end ofthe graph), we constructed Type-3 (message category + visual feature) rules.",

        "By finding the covariance between the visual feature (i.e., volatility) and the frequency with which a corresponding proposition was annotated in the corpus summaries, a Type-2 rule assigns a weight to this proposition based on the magnitude of the visual feature.",

        "The importance of each concept is rated according to a measure of information density (ID) involving several factors: Saturation Level Completeness of attributes in model entry: a concept's filled-in slots (f) vs. its total slots (s), and the importance of the concepts (ci) filling those slots: S * log(s) *Y1 f=i ID (a) Connectedness Number of connections (n) with other concepts (cj ), and the importance of these connected concepts: jj=1 ID(cj) Frequency Number of observed phrasings (e) realizing the concept in text of the current document Prominence in Text Prominence based on document structure (WD) and rhetorical devices (WR) Graph Salience Salience assessed by the graph understanding system (Wg) - only applies to concepts appearing in the graphics",

        "Saturation corresponds to the completeness of the concept in the model.",
        "The more attribute slots that are filled, the more we know about a particular concept instance.",
        "However, this measure is highly sensitive to the degree of detail provided in the semantic grammar and ontology class definition (whether created by hand or automatically).",
        "A concept having two slots, both of which are filled-out, is not necessarily more important than a concept with only 12 of its 15 slots filled.",
        "The more important a concept category is in a given domain, the more detailed its ontology class definition will likely be.",
        "Thus, we can assume that a concept definition having a dozen or more slots is, broadly speaking, more important in the domain than a less well-defined concept having only one or two slots.",
        "This insight is the basis of a normalization factor (log(s)) used in ID.",
        "Saturation differs somewhat from repetition in that it attempts to measure the amount of information associated with a concept, rather than simply the number of times a concept is mentioned in the text.",
        "For example, a news article about a proposed law might mention \"Washington\" several times, but the fact that the debate took place in Washington, D.C. is unlikely to be an important part of the article.",
        "However, the key provisions of the bill, which may individually be mentioned only once, are likely more important as a greater amount of detail is provided concerning them.",
        "Simple repetition is not necessarily indicative of the importance of a concept, but if a large amount of information is provided for a given concept, it is safe to assume the concept is important in the context of that document.",
        "Document structure (WD) is another important clue in determining which elements of a text are important enough to include in a summary (Marcu, 1997).",
        "If a concept is featured prominently in the title, or appears in the first or final paragraphs, it is likely more important than a concept buried in the middle of the document.",
        "Importance is also affected by certain rhetorical devices (WR) which serve to highlight particular concepts.",
        "Being used in an idiom, or compared to another concept by means of juxtaposition suggests that a given concept may hold special significance.",
        "Finally, the weights assigned by our graph understanding system for the additional propositions identified in the graphics are incorporated into the ID of the concepts involved as WG.",
        "To select concepts for inclusion in the summary, the model will then be passed to a discourse-aware graph-based content selection framework (Demir et al., 2010), which selects concepts one at a time and iteratively re-weights the remaining items so as to include related concepts and avoid redundancy.",
        "This algorithm incorporates PageRank (Page et al., 1999), but with several modifications.",
        "In addition to centrality assessment based on relationships between concepts, it includes apriori importance nodes enabling us to incorporate concept completeness, number of expressions, document structure, and rhetorical devices.",
        "More importantly from a summary generation perspective, the algorithm iteratively picks concepts one at a time, and re-ranks the remaining entries by increasing the weight of related items and discounting redundant ones.",
        "This allows us to select concepts that complement each other while simultaneously avoiding redundancy."
