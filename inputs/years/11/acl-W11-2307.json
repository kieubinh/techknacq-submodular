        "• Though syllable based systems produce good quality speech output for syllabic Indian languages, syllables being larger units, require a large speech corpus to maximize syllable coverage.",
        "This means a larger footprint.",
        "• In the paradigm being used, text processing modules are required to provide the syllable",

        "With input text for Indian languages being UTF-8 encoded, Indian language festival TTS systems have to be modified to accept UTF-8 input.",
        "A module was included in festival to parse the input text and give the appropriate syllable sequence.",
        "With grapheme to phoneme conversion being non-trivial, a set of grapheme to phoneme rules were included as part of the module.",
        "• Indian languages have a special representation for vowel modifiers, which do not have a sound unit as opposed to that in Latin script languages.",
        "Hence, to deal with such characters while typing, they were mapped to sound units of their corresponding full vowels.",
        "An example in Hindi is shown in Figure 1.",
        "To enable the newly built voice to be listed in the list of festival voices under ORCA preferences menu, it has to be proclaimed as UTF-8 encoding in the lexicon scheme file of the voice [Nepali TTS 2008].",

        "• Performance of the TTS system",
        "• Adaptability of users to the new system",
        "As the common screenreader used among the visually challenged community is JAWS, a study was conducted to find out the ease of adaptability for the user to the new system.",
        "Since the front end for the system are screen readers, the parameter used in this testing was primarily the learning involved in switching from JAWS to ORCA or NVDA.",
        "As JAWS and NVDA are Windows based screen readers, all the keystokes and shortcut keys are the same.",
        "A computer literate who has used JAWS, will learn NVDA quicker than others.",
        "As ORCA is a Linux based screen reader, the shortcut keys, key strokes and navigation through the system are different compared to that of JAWS.",
        "It takes more time for a JAWS user to familiarize with the Linux operating system, ORCA settings and keystokes.",
        "• Navigation of desktop and web pages using the screen reader",
        "When default English locale is selected for Windows and Linux systems, all the program menus and navigational keys are in English.",
        "The initial version of the TTS system was not able to parse these English words.",
        "As a solution, switching of voices between English and the selected Indian language was tried.",
        "The system was made to switch between Festival's English Kal diphone voice and one of the Indian language voices.",
        "When an English word is given as input, the English voice would be loaded and when an Indian language word is given as input, it switches to the respective Indian language, loads the voice and speaks the word.",
        "This frequent switching of voices degraded the performance of the system and hearing two different voices, without continuity was annoying to the listener.",
        "This led to the development of a bilingual voice.",
        "Bilingual Voice: Each Indian language voice is provided with an English pronunciation dictionary, so that when an English word is provided to the system, speech is synthesized using the Indian language voice itself.",
        "Following are the enhancements made to better the TTS system.",
        "- Pronunciation Dictionary for English words in native sound units",
        "The English dictionary from Carnegie Mellon University(CMU) with phone pronunciation was used to create English to Native language pronounciation dictionary.",
        "An entry in the CMU dictionary : (\"abolish\" ax baa l ih sh).",
        "These English phones were mapped to phones in native language.",
        "An example mapping from English to Hindi language : ax=a , b=^ , aa=ar, l=T , ih=i , sh=?T.",
        "For all the English words in the dictionary, the native language representation was created, abolish = a«nR^The pronunciation dictionary was then created by breaking these words down into syllables and phone sequences present in the database.",
        "(\"abolish\" a «TT",
        "All such English words that are required to navigate through a desktop(including special keys) and web, were collected and added to the pronunciation dictionary.",
        "The drawback of this method is that if an English word which is not present in the pronunciation dictionary, is provided as input, the TTS system cannot synthesize it.",
        "In order to overcome this, English Letter To Sound (LTS) rules were implemented.",
        "- Implementation of English LTS Rules",
        "Inputs can be in English or the native language.",
        "In the case of a word being absent in the pronunciation dictionary, LTS rules should supplement.",
        "LTS rules have been developed for English in festival using a pronunciation dictionary of around 100000 words as the training set [Black et al.",
        "1998].",
        "These LTS rules generate a sequence of phones for the English word.",
        "By mapping the English phones to phones in the native language, one can provide a phone sequence in terms of the Indian language, for an English word.",
        "For example, a part of the Classification and Regression Tree(CART) for letter 'd' in a word, by looking at the context in which it is occuring is shown in Figure 3.",
        "The first part of the figure is a partial tree in English.",
        "The second part of the figure is the corresponding entry for the Indian language.",
        "If'd' is followed by another'd', no sound('epsilon;) is assigned.",
        "If it is followed by 'i' and 'r' 'phone d' is assigned for English, whereas 'phone d' is mapped to T for Hindi language.",
        "- Recording of Common English words",
        "Most of the English words when spoken in the Indian language voice did not sound intelligible enough.",
        "This is because, many English sounds were not available in Indian languages.",
        "Hence frequently seen English words while navigating a Windows/Linux desktop were recorded.",
        "Instead of concatenating Indian phones to synthesize the English word, the naturally uttered English word is spoken.",
        "This increased the usability of the system.",
        "The system was tested to check if it responded to each and every input provided to it.",
        "Words, sentences and paragraphs were provided as input to the system using commonly used applications like notepad, word processor and browser.",
        "The system was able to read the words whose syllables were present in the database.",
        "The testing was done extensively for each language which resulted in some words not being spoken, which helped in the identification ofthose syllables which need to be included in the database.",
        "Some of the major issues identified during this test were:",
        "• Issues during typing",
        "The evaluator tested the system by typing using SCIM in Linux systems and the inbuilt InScript keyboard in Windows systems.",
        "As it is unit selection based synthesis, the sound units for the corresponding characters that are picked up from the database may not be clear or audible.",
        "Also, the prosody of these individual characters, when taken from different contexts will vary.",
        "While typing, flat and prosodically neutral sounds are preffered.",
        "This led to recording of all aksharas (alphabets) in all six languages, in a prosodically neutral flat tone.",
        "It was also observed that the system was not reading vowel modifiers.",
        "This issue was solved by adding entries for vowel modifiers in the pronunciation dictionary.",
        "The vowel modifiers were mapped to the corresponding vowel pronunciation.",
        "• Issues during reading web pages",
        "The system was tested for reading content from web pages.",
        "It was found that when a line with any special character(for example <,>,') is given as input, the system would fail to read the entire line.",
        "This led to the handling of special characters in the Indian language voice.",
        "If anything outside the unicode range of the language is provided to the system, it is ignored.",
        "In this way, even if some special or junk characters are present in a line, the system will read the whole line ignoring these characters.",
        "The evaluator noted the response time of the system while loading the voice, typing, navigation through desktop and web pages.",
        "• Loading of voices",
        "In the unit selection paradigm, we have a large repository of multiple realizations of a unit (syllables) in different contexts.",
        "The text to be spoken is broken down into these units.",
        "Syllable speech units are then indexed with their linguistic and phonetic features using clustering techniques (CART) to capture the context in which they are uttered.",
        "With many realizations of the same syllable being present, CART are used to select a smaller set of candidate units for the syllable to be spoken.",
        "These CART built as part of the voice building process, attempt to predict the acoustic properties of the unit using its phonetic and linguistic features at the time of synthesis [Black and Taylor 1997].",
        "When the festival engine loads a voice, although the speech waveforms are saved on the hard disk, the CART gets loaded into the heap memory.",
        "As the size of this tree file exceeds the default heap size set in the festival framework, the initial version of the Indian language TTS voices failed to load.",
        "Hence, a larger heap size was provided as a runtime argument for the festival synthesizer.",
        "• Response time for typing and reading",
        "The user expects the system to respond in a reasonable amount of time (approx 125 milliseconds).",
        "For the initial system, the response time for a sentence with 5 to 10 words was 1 to 2 seconds.",
        "To improve the response time of the system, the voice(s) had to be pruned.",
        "In the case of unit selection paradigm, a large database with multiple realizations is used to produce natural speech.",
        "Around 300000 units with multiple realizations ofsyllables including the 'silence' unit are present in the database.",
        "In the cluster unit framework [Black and Taylor 1997], these syllables are clustered into similar sounding groups and form the leaves of the CART built.",
        "This resulted in a large CART file which in turn slowed down the system.",
        "With around 300000 realizations of syllables being present, it is seen that there are far too many realizations of frequently occuring syllables.",
        "So it was vital to prune the CART built.",
        "To effectively capture prosody for syllables, after experimenting heuristically with various cluster sizes, a leaf size of eight was used, i.e syllables are clustered into groups of eight.",
        "To prune the tree using the tools available within festival [Black and Lenzo 2000], within each cluster only two units closest to the centroid were retained and the rest were removed, hence reducing the tree size.",
        "Even after pruning the voice, it was seen that there were still a very large number (around 20000) of silence units, which are used to annotate phrase and sentence boundaries, in the speech corpus.",
        "It was seen that the silence units could be quantized into two units, one to denote end ofphrase and another for end of sentence, without affecting the performance.",
        "Hence silence trees were removed from the CART retaining just the two quantized units, further pruning the tree and improving the speed.",
        "After pruning, the size of the tree for Tamil language was reduced from an 8 MB file to 1.7 MB file.",
        "The response time for sentences having word rate between 5 to 10 for the pruned system was 200milliseconds to 900 milliseconds.",
        "On an average there was 61% improvement in the response time."

        "Sentences belonging to different domains were chosen for quality evaluation, in order to test the performance of TTS system(s) upon receiving input text from varied domains.",
        "The various factors that were considered, while administering the quality evaluation tests were:",
        "• The MOS evaluators were chosen, such that they should not have participated in any listening quality test for synthetic speech, at least for the last 6 months and are well versed with the language.",
        "• The tests were done up to a maximum of 30-40 minutes, in order to avoid listener fatigue.",
        "• A reasonable number of MOS evaluators (a minimum of 20) were involved for evaluating the quality.",
        "• The tests were conducted in a quiet room and the content to be evaluated was played through a good quality speaker.",
        "• For MOS tests, the sentences belonging to various domains were grouped into various sets and the order of these sets were randomized in order to avoid any learning effects.",
        "• Randomized sentences were played one after the other, with a brief pause for listeners to provide the quality score, based on the scales provided in Table 3.",
        "• In the case of DMOS tests, a natural sentence followed by its synthesized counterpart is played after a brief pause and the listeners have to rate the amount of degradation in the synthesized sentence, relative to the natural sentence.",
        "This rating is based on the scales provided in",
        "Table 3.",
        "• DMOS tests were conducted first, so that the participants get a feeling of how natural and synthesized sentences sound.",
        "• 40 sentences were used to conduct the MOS test and 10 sentences for DMOS test.",
        "The MOS and DMOS scores for the six Indian languages are provided in Table 4.",
        "Overall comprehension was also considered important, as the primary goal or aim of the TTS system was to be able to communicate information to the user.",
        "Thus, a preliminary comprehension based MOS test was conducted, which involved playing out a paragraph to the MOS evaluators and testing their level of comprehension."
