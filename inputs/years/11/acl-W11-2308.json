        "Recently, there has been increasing interest in the exploitation of results from Natural Language Processing (NLP) for the development of assistive technologies.",
        "Here, we address this topic by reporting the first but promising results in the development of a software architecture for the Italian language aimed at assisting people with low literacy skills (both native and foreign speakers) or who have language disabilities in reading texts.",
        "Within an information society, where everyone should be able to access all available information, improving access to written language is becoming more and more a central issue.",
        "This is the case, for instance, of administrative and governmental information which should be accessible to all members of the society, including people who have reading difficulties for different reasons: because of a low education level or because of the fact that the language in question is not their mother tongue, or because of language disabilities.",
        "Health related information represents another crucial domain which should be accessible to a large and heterogenous target group.",
        "Understandability in general and readability in particular is also an important issue for accessing information over the web as stated in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) proposed by the Web Accessibility Initiative of the W3C.",
        "In this paper, we describe the approach we developed for automatically assessing the readability of newspaper texts with a view to the specific task of text simplification.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the background literature on the topic; Section 3 introduces the main features of our approach to readability assessment, with Section 4 illustrating its implementation in the READ-IT prototype; Sections 5 and 6 describe the experimental setting and discuss achieved results."

      "heading": "2. Background",
      "text": [
        "Readability assessment has been a central research topic for the past 80 years which is still attracting considerable interest nowadays.",
        "Over the last ten years, within the NLP community the automatic assessment of readability has received increasing attention: if on the one hand the availability of sophisticated NLP technologies makes it possible to monitor a wide variety of factors affecting the readability of a text, on the other hand there is a wide range of both human-and machine-oriented applications which can benefit from it.",
        "Traditional readability formulas focus on a limited set of superficial text features which are taken as rough approximations of the linguistic factors at play in readability assessment.",
        "For example, the Flesch-Kincaid measure (the most common reading difficulty measure still in use, Kincaid (1975)) is a linear function of the average number of syllables per word and of the average number of words per sentence, where the former and latter are used as simple proxies for lexical and syntactic complexity respectively.",
        "For Italian, there are two readability formulas: an adaptation of the Flesh-Kincaid for English to Italian known as the Flesch-Vacca formula (Franchina and Vacca, 1986); the GulpEase index (Lucisano and Piemontese, 1988), assessing readability on the basis of the average number of characters per word and the average number of words per sentence.",
        "A widely acknowledged fact is that all traditional readability metrics are quick and easy to calculate but have drawbacks.",
        "For example, the use of sentence length as a measure of syntactic complexity assumes that a longer sentence is more grammatically complex than a shorter one, which is often but not always the case.",
        "Word syllable count is used starting from the assumption that more frequent words are more likely to have fewer syllables than less frequent ones (an association that is related to Zipf's Law, Zipf (1935)); yet, similarly to the previous case, word length does not necessarily reflects its difficulty.",
        "The unreliability of these metrics has been experimentally demonstrated by several recent studies in the field: to mention only a few Si and Callan (2001), Petersen and Ostendorf (2006), Feng (2009).",
        "On the front of the assessment of the lexical difficulty of a given text, a first step forward is represented by vocabulary-based formulas such as the Dale-Chall formula (Chall and Dale, 1995), using a combination of average sentence length and word frequency counts.",
        "In particular, for what concerns the latter it reconstructs the percentage of words not on a list of 3000 \"easy\" words by matching its own list to the words in the material being evaluated, to determine the appropriate reading level.",
        "If vocabulary-based measures represent an improvement in assessing the readability of texts which was possible due to the availability of frequency dictionaries and reference corpora, they are still unsatisfactory for what concerns sentence structure.",
        "Over the last ten years, work on readability deployed sophisticated NLP techniques, such as syntactic parsing and statistical language modeling, to capture more complex linguistic features and used statistical machine learning to build readability assessment tools.",
        "A variety of different NLP-based approaches to the automatic readability assessment has been proposed so far, differing with respect to: a) the typology of features taken into account (e.g. lexical, syntactic, semantic, discourse), and, for each type, at the level of the inventory of used individual features; b) the intended audience of the texts under evaluation, which strongly influences the readability assessment, and last but not least c) the application within which readability assessment is carried out.",
        "Interesting alternatives to static vocabulary-based measures have been put forward by Si and Callan (2001) who used unigram language models combined with sentence length to capture content information from scientific web pages, or by Collins-Thompson and Callan (2004) who adopted a similar language modeling approach (Smoothed Unigram model) to predict reading difficulty of short passages and web documents.",
        "These approaches can be seen as a generalization of the vocabulary-based approach, aimed at capturing finer-grained and more flexible information about vocabulary usage.",
        "If unigram language models help capturing important content information and variation of word usage, they do not cover other types of features which are reported to play a significant role in the assessment of readability.",
        "More recently, the role of syntactic features started being investigated (Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005; Heilman et al., 2007; Petersen and Ostendorf, 2009): in these studies syntactic structure is tracked through a combination of features from n-gram (trigram, bigram and unigram) language models and parse trees (parse tree height, number of noun phrases, verb phrases and subordinated clauses or SBARs) with more traditional features.",
        "Yet, besides lexical and syntactic complexity features there are other important factors, such as the structure of the text, the definition of discourse topic, discourse cohesion and coherence and so on, playing a central role in determining the reading difficulty of a text.",
        "More recent approaches esplored the role of these features in readability assessment: this is the case, for instance, of Barzilay and Lapata (2008) or Feng (2010).",
        "The last few years have been characterised by approaches based on the combination of features ranging over different linguistic levels, namely lexical, syntactic and discourse (see e.g. Pitler and Nenkova (2008), Kate (2010)).",
        "Another important factor determining the typology of features to be considered for assessing readability has to do with the intended audience of readers: it is commonly agreed that reading ease does not follow from intrinsic text properties alone, but it is also affected by the expected audience.",
        "Among the studies addressing readability with respect to specific audiences, it is worth mentioning here: Schwarm and Ostendorf (2005) and Heilman et al.",
        "(2007) dealing with language learners, or Feng (2009) focussing on people with mild intellectual disabilities.",
        "Interestingly,Heilman et al.",
        "(2007) differentiate the typology of used features when addressing first (L1) or second (L2) language learners: they argue that grammatical features are more relevant for L2 than for L1 learners.",
        "Feng (2009) propose a set of cognitively motivated features operating at the discourse level specifically addressing the cognitive characteristics of the expected users.",
        "When readability is targeted towards adult competent language users a more prominent role is played by discourse features (Pitler and Nenkova, 2008).",
        "Applications which can benefit from an automatic readability assessment range from the selection of reading material tailored to varying literacy levels (e.g. for L1/L2 students or low literacy people) and the ranking of documents by reading difficulty (e.g. in returning the results of web queries) to NLP tasks such as automatic document summarization, machine translation as well as text simplification.",
        "Again, also the application making use of the readability assessment, which is in turn strictly related to the intended audience of readers, strongly influences the typology of features to be taken into account.",
        "Advanced NLP-based readability metrics developed so far typically deal with English, with a few attempts devoted to other languages, namely French (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004), Portuguese (Aluisio et al., 2010) and German (BrÃ¼ck, 2008)."

      "text": [
        "Our approach to readability assessment was developed with a specific application in mind, i.e. text simplification, and addresses a specific target audience of readers, namely people characterised by low literacy skills and/or by mild cognitive impairment.",
        "Following the most recent approaches, we treat readability assessment as a classification task: in particular, given the available corpora for the Italian language as well as the type of target audience, we resorted to a binary classification aimed at discerning easy-to-read textual objects from difficult-to-read ones.",
        "The language dealt with is Italian: to our knowledge, this is the first attempt of an advanced methodology for readability assessment for this language.",
        "Our approach focuses on lexical and syntactic features, whose selection was influenced by the application, the intended audience and the language dealt with (both for its intrinsic linguistic features and for the fact of being a less resourced language).",
        "Following Roark (2007), in the features selection process we preferred easy-to-identify features which could be reliably identified within the output of NLP tools.",
        "Last but not least, as already done by Aluisio et al.",
        "(2010) the set of selected syntactic features also includes simplification oriented ones, with the final aim of aligning the readability assessment step with the text simplification process.",
        "Another qualifying feature of our approach to readability assessment consists in the fact that we are dealing with two types of textual objects: documents and sentences.",
        "The latter represents an important novelty of our work since so far most research focused on readability classification at the document level (Skory and Eskenazi, 2010).",
        "When the target application is text simplification, we strongly believe that also assessing readability at the sentence level could be very useful.",
        "We know that methods developed so far perform well to characterize the level of an entire document, but they are unreliable for short texts and thus also for single sentences.",
        "Sentence-based readability assessment thus represents a further challenge we decided to tackle: in fact, if all sentences occurring in simplified texts can be assumed to be easy-to-read sentences, the reverse does not necessarily hold since not all sentences occurring in complex texts are difficult-to-read sentences.",
        "Since there are no training data at the sentence level, it becomes difficult - if not impossible - to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, i.e. erroneous readability assessments within the class of difficult-to-read texts may either correspond to those easy-to-read sentences occurring within complex texts or represent real classification errors.",
        "In order to overcome this problem in the readability assessment of individual sentences, we introduced a notion of distance with respect to easy-to-read sentences.",
        "In this way, the prerequisites are created for the integration of the two processes of readability assessment and text simplification.",
        "Before, text readability was assessed with respect to the entire document and text simplification was carried out at the sentence level: due to the decoupling of the two processes, the impact of simplification operations on the overall readability level of the text was not always immediately clear.",
        "With sentence-based readability assessment, this should be no longer a problem."

        "READ-IT operates on syntactically (i.e. dependency) parsed texts and it assigns to each considered reading object - either a document or a sentence - a score quantifying its readability.",
        "READ-IT is a classifier based on Support Vector Machines using LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2001) that, given a set of features and a training corpus, creates a statistical model using the feature statistics extracted from the training corpus.",
        "Such a model is used in the assessment of readability of unseen documents and sentences.",
        "The set of features used to build the statistical model can be parameterized through a configuration file: as we will see, the set of relevant features used for readability assessment at the document level differs from the those used at the sentence level.",
        "This also creates the prerequisites for specialising the readability assessment measure with respect to more specific target audiences: as pointed out in Heilman et al.",
        "(2007) different types of features come into play e.g. when addressing L1 or L2 language learners.",
        "Here follows the complete list of features used in the reported experiments.",
        "The features used for predicting readability are organised into four main categories: namely, raw text features, lexical features as well as morpho-syntactic and syntactic features.",
        "This proposed fourfold partition closely follows the different levels of linguistic analysis automatically carried out on the text being evaluated, i.e. tokenization, lemmatization, PoS tagging and dependency parsing.",
        "Such a partition was meant to identify those easy to extract features with high discriminative power in order to reduce the linguistic preprocessing oftexts guaranteeing at the same time a reliable readability assessment.",
        "Raw Text Features",
        "They refer to those features typically used within traditional readability metrics.",
        "They include Sentence Length, calculated as the average number of words per sentence, and Word Length, calculated as the average number of characters per words.",
        "Lexical Features Basic Italian Vocabulary rate features: these features refer to the internal composition of the vocabulary of the text.",
        "To this end, we took as a reference resource the Basic Italian Vocabulary by De Mauro (2000), including a list of 7000 words highly familiar to native speakers of Italian.",
        "In particular, we calculated two different features corresponding to: i) the percentage of all unique words (types) on this reference list (calculated on a per-lemma basis); ii) the internal distribution of the occurring basic Italian vocabulary words into the usage classification classes of 'fundamental words' (very frequent words), 'high usage words' (frequent words) and 'high availability words' (relatively lower frequency words referring to everyday objects or actions and thus well known to speakers).",
        "Whereas the latter represents a novel feature in the readability assessment literature, the former originates from the Dale-Chall formula (Chall and Dale, 1995) and, as implemented here, it can be seen as the complement of the type out-of-vocabulary rate features used by Petersen and Ostendorf (2009).",
        "Type/Token Ratio: this feature refers to the ratio between the number of lexical types and the number of tokens.",
        "This feature, which can be considered as an indicator of expressive language delay or disorder as shown in Wright (2003) for adults and in Retherford (2003) for children, has already been used for readability assessment purposes by Aluisio et al.",
        "(2010).",

        "The model is simply defined by a list of types (POS) and their individual probabilities.",
        "This feature has already been shown to be a reliable indicator for automatic readability assessment (see, for example, Pitler and Nenkova (2008) and Aluisio et al.",
        "(2010)).",
        "Lexical density: this feature refers to the ratio of content words (verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs) to the total number of lexical tokens in a text.",

        "(2010) and Feng (2010).",

        "It is a novel and language-specific feature exploiting the predictive power of the Italian rich verbal morphology.",
        "Syntactic Features Unconditional probability of dependency types:",
        "this feature refers to the unconditional probability of different types of syntactic dependencies (e.g. subject, direct object, modifier, etc.)",
        "and can be seen as the dependency-based counterpart of the 'phrase type rate' feature used by Nenkova (2010).",
        "Parse tree depth features: parse tree depth can be indicative of increased sentence complexity as stated by, to mention only a few, Yngve (1960), Frazier (1985) and Gibson (1998).",
        "This set of features is meant to capture different aspects of the parse tree depth and includes the following measures: a) the depth of the whole parse tree, calculated in terms of the longest path from the root of the dependency tree to some leaf; b) the average depth of embedded complement 'chains' governed by a nominal head and including either prepositional complements or nominal and adjectival modifiers; c) the probability distribution of embedded complement 'chains' by depth.",
        "The first feature has already been used in syntaxbased readability assessment studies (Schwarm and 2010); the latter two are reminiscent of the 'head noun modifiers' feature used by Nenkova (2010).",
        "Verbal predicates features: this set of features captures different aspects of the behaviour of verbal predicates.",
        "They range from the number of verbal roots with respect to number of all sentence roots occurring in a text to their arity.",
        "The arity ofverbal predicates is calculated as the number of instantiated dependency links sharing the same verbal head (covering both arguments and modifiers).",
        "Although there is no obvious relation between the number of verb dependents and sentence complexity, we believe that both a low and a high number of dependents can make sentence readability quite complex, although for different reasons (elliptical constructions in the former case, a high number of modifiers in the latter).",
        "Within this feature set we also considered the distribution of verbal predicates by arity.",
        "To our knowledge, this set of features has never been used so far for readability assessment purposes.",

        "(2010), this set of features has been introduced here with a specific view to the text simplification task.",
        "A first feature was meant to measure the distribution ofsubordi-nate vs main clauses.",
        "For subordinates, we also considered their relative ordering with respect to the main clause: according to Miller and Weinert (1998), sentences containing subordinate clauses in post-verbal rather than in pre-verbal position are easier to read.",
        "Two further features were introduced to capture the depth of embedded subordinate clauses since it is a widely acknowledged fact that highly complex sentences contain deeply embedded subordinate clauses: in particular, a) the average depth of'chains' ofembedded subordinate clauses and b) the probability distribution ofembedded subordinate clauses 'chains' by depth.",
        "Length of dependency links feature: both Lin (1996) and Gibson (1998) showed that the syntactic complexity of sentences can be predicted with measures based on the length of dependency links.",
        "This is also demonstrated in McDonald and Nivre (2007) who claim that statistical parsers have a drop in accuracy when analysing long dependencies.",
        "Here, the dependency length is measured in terms of the words occurring between the syntactic head and the dependent.",

        "Instead, to test our approach to automatically identify the readability of a given text, we used two different corpora: a newspaper corpus, La Repubblica (henceforth, \"Rep\"), and an easy-to-read newspaper, Due Parole (henceforth, \"2Par\") which was specifically written for an audience of adults with a rudimentary literacy level or with mild intellectual disabilities.",
        "The articles in 2Par were written by Italian linguists expert in text simplification using a controlled language both at the lexicon and sentence structure levels (Piemon-tese, 1996).",
        "There are different motivations underlying the selection of these two corpora for our study.",
        "On the practical side, to our knowledge 2Par is the only available corpus of simplified texts addressing a wide audience characterised by a low literacy level.",
        "So, the use of 2Par represented the only possible option on the front of simplified texts.",
        "For the selection of the second corpus we opted for texts belonging to the same class, i.e. newspapers: this was aimed at avoiding interferences due to textual genre variation in the measure of text readability.",
        "This is confirmed by the fact that the two corpora show a similar behaviour with respect to a number of different parameters, which according to the literature on register variation (Biber, 2009) are indicative of textual genre differences: e.g. lexical density, the noun/verb ratio, the percentage of verbal roots, etc.",
        "On the other hand, the two corpora differ significantly with respect to the distribution of features typically correlated with text complexity, e.g. the composition of the used vocabulary (e.g. the percentage of words belonging to the Basic Italian Vocabulary in Rep is 4.14% and in 2Par is 48.04%) or, from the syntactic point of view, the average parse tree height (which in Rep is 5.71 and in 2Par 3.67), the average number of verb phrases per sentence (which in Rep is 2.40 and in 2Par 1.25), the depth of nested structures (e.g. the average depth of embedded complement 'chains' in Rep is 1.44 and in 2Par is 1.30), the proportion of main vs subordinate clauses (in Rep main and subordinate clauses represent respectively 65.11% and 34.88% of the cases; in 2Par there is 79.66% of main clauses and 20.33% of subordinate clauses).",
        "The Rep/2Par pair of corpora is somehow reminiscent of corpora used in other readability studies, such as Encyclopedia Britannica and Britannica Elementary, but with a main difference: whereas the English corpora consist of paired original/simplified texts, which we might define as \"parallel monolingual corpora\", the selected Italian corpora rather present themselves as \"comparable monolingual corpora\", without any pairing of the full-simplified versions of the same article.",
        "Comparability is guaranteed here by the inclusion of texts belonging to the same textual genre: we expect such comparable corpora to be usefully exploited for readability assessment because of the emphasis on style over topic.",
        "Although these corpora do not provide an explicit grade-level ranking for each article, broad categories are distinguished, namely easy-to-read vs difficult-to-read texts.",

        "In particular, Accuracy is a global score referring to the percentage of documents or sentences correctly classified, either as easy-to-read or difficult-to-read objects.",
        "Precision and Recall have been computed with respect to two the target reading levels: in particular, Precision is the ratio of the number of correctly classified documents or sentences over the total number of documents and sentences classified by READ-IT as belonging to the easy-to-read (i.e. 2Par) or difficult-to-read (i.e. Rep) classes; Recall has been computed as the ratio of the number of correctly classified documents or sentences over the total number of documents or sentences belonging to each reading level in the test sets.",
        "For each set of experiments, evaluation was carried out with respect to the four models of the classifier.",
        "Following from the assumption that 2Par contains only easy-to-read sentences while Rep does not necessarily contain only difficult-to-read ones, we consider READ-IT errors in the classification of 2Par sentences as erroneously classified sentences.",
        "On the other hand, classification errors within the set of Rep sentences deserve an in-depth error analysis, since we need to discern real errors from mis-classifications due to the fact that we are in front of easy-to-read sentences occurring in a difficult-to-read context.",
        "In order discern errors from 'correct' misclassifications, we introduced a new evaluation methodology, based on the notion of Euclidean distance between feature vectors.",
        "Each feature vector is a n-dimensional vector of linguistic features (see Section 4.1) that represents a set of sentences.",
        "Two vectors with 0 distance represent the same set of sentences, i.e. those sentences sharing the same values for the monitored linguistic features.",
        "Conversely, the bigger the distance between two vectors is, the more distant are the two represented sets of sentences with respect to the monitored features.",
        "The same notion of distance has also been used to test which model was more effective in predicting the readability of n-word long sentences.",
        "In Table 1, the Accuracy, Precision and Recall scores achieved with the different READ-IT models in the document classification subtask are reported.",
        "It can be noticed that the Base Model shows the lowest performance, while the MorphoS Model outperforms all other models.",
        "Interestingly, the Lexical Model shows a high accuracy for what concerns the document classification subtask (95.45%), by significantly improving the accuracy score of the Base Model (about +19%).",
        "This result demonstrates that for assessing the readability of documents a combination of raw and lexical features provides reliable results which can be further improved (about +3%) by also taking into account morpho-syntax.",
        "(360 sentences, referred to as correct in the Table), iii) the whole Rep test set.",
        "As we can see, the distance between the wrong sentences and 2Par is much lower than the distance holding between 2Par and the correcly classified sentences (correct).",
        "This entails that the sentences which were erroneously classified as easy-to-read sentences (i.e. belonging to 2Par) are in fact more readable than the correctly classified ones (as belonging to Rep).It is obvious that the Rep test set, which contains both correct and wrong sentences, has an intermediate distance value with respect to 2Par.",
        "Consider now the sentence classification subtask.",
        "Table 2 shows that in this case the most reliable results are achieved with the Syntax Model.",
        "It is interesting to note that the morpho-syntactic and syntactic features allow a much higher increment in terms of Accuracy, Precision and Recall scores than in the document classification scenario: i.e. the difference between the performance of the Lexical Model and the best one in the document classification experiment (i.e. the MorphoS Model) is equal to 2.6%, while in the sentence classification case (i.e. Syntax Model) is much higher, namely 17% .",
        "In Table 3, we detail the performance of the best READ-IT model (i.e. the Syntax Model) on the Rep test set.",
        "In order to evaluate those sentences which were erroneously classified as belonging to 2Par, we calculated the distance between 2Par and i) these sentences (140 sentences referred to as wrong in the Table), ii) the correctly classified sentences",
        "In Table 4, the percentage of Rep 2.5 sentences classified as difficult-to-read is reported.",
        "The results show that the Syntax Model classifies the higher number of sentences as difficult-to-read, but from these results we cannot say whether this model is the best one or not since Rep 2.5 sentences are not annotated with readability information.",
        "Therefore, in order to compare the performance of the four READ-IT models and to identify which is the best one, we computed the distance between the sentences classified as easy-to-read and 2Par, which is reported, for each model, in Table 5.",
        "It can be noticed that the Syntax Model appears to be the best one since it shows the lowest distance with respect to 2Par; on the other hand, the whole Rep 2.5 corpus shows a higher distance since it contains both difficult-and easy-to-read sentences.",
        "Obviously, the sentences classified as difficult-to-read by the Syntax Model (Diff Syntax in the Table) show the broader distance.",
