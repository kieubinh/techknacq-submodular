        "They have problems with verb tenses, concordances of gender and number, etc., and they have difficulties when creating a mental image of abstract concepts.",

        "The most important type of error (35% of the cases) is related to the fact that in Spanish there are more words than signs in LSE (7.7 for Spanish and 5.7 for LSE in this corpus).",
        "This circumstance provokes different types of errors: generation of many phrases in the same output, producing a high number of insertions.",
        "When dealing with long sentences there is the risk that the translation model cannot deal properly with the big distortion.",
        "This produces important changes in order and sometimes the sentence is truncated producing several deletions.",
        "The second most important source of errors (25% of the cases) is related to the fact that when translating Spanish into LSE, there is a relevant number of words in the testing set that they do not appear in the training set due to the higher variability presented in Spanish.",
        "These words are named Out Of Vocabulary words.",
        "For example, in Spanish there are many verb conjugations that are translated into the same sign sequence.",
        "So, when a new conjugation appears in the evaluation set, it is an OOV that provokes a translation error.",
        "Other important source of errors corresponds to ordering errors provoked by the different order in predication: LSE has a SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) while Spanish SVO (Subject-Verb-Object).",
        "In this case, the frequency is close to 20%",
        "Finally, there are others causes of errors like the wrong generation of the different classifiers needed in LSE and not presented in Spanish (11%) and the existence of some deletions when translating very specific names, even when they are in the training set.",
        "Some of these names (i.e. 'mud' is translated into SAND + WATER) need some periphrasis in LSE that not always are properly generated.",
        "Based on this error analysis, the main causes of the translation errors are related to the different variability in the vocabulary for Spanish and LSE (much higher in Spanish), the different number for words or signs in the sentences (higher in Spanish) and the different predication order.",
        "The categorization module allows reducing the variability in the source language (for example, several verb conjugations are tagged with the same tag) and also the number of tokens composing the input sentence (when removing non-relevant words).",
        "Also, reducing the source language variability and the number of tokens provoke an important reduction on the number of source-target alignments the system has to train.",
        "When having a small corpus, as it is the case of many sign languages, this reduction of alignment points permits to obtain better training models with less data, improving the results.",
        "These aspects allow increasing the system performance.",
        "Presumably, if there were a very large corpus of Spanish-to-Spanish-Sign-Language available, the system could learn better translation models and the improvement reached with this categorization module would be lower.",
