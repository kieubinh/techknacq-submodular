        "Different language supportive aids for these persons have evolved over the years, mainly as graphical systems containing symbols and pictures, simplified supportive signing (derived from sign language vocabulary), or a combination of these, possibly comprising speech synthesis and speech recognition.",
        "All these supportive measures and methods are referred to as Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC).",
        "A vocabulary comprising 20,878 lemma or base forms from different sources was analysed in terms of frequency and dispersion.",
        "The primary issue in this study was to analyse to what extent the concepts in the main AAC symbol databases mirror the vocabulary needed to produce and understand everyday Swedish language.",
        "Another goal was to investigate the possibility of extending the AAC symbol databases by combining separate basic words from the vocabulary into compounds."

        "A fundamental aspect for participation in the society is the possibility to acquire information and to communicate.",
        "For the majority of citizens, getting information on everyday issues is hardly a task entailing any specific problems.",
        "There is, however, a substantial number of persons who have substantial difficulties to benefit from ordinary written and spoken sources, being dependent upon other modalities, either to express themselves, or as a support for interpretation, or both.",
        "For this purpose, AAC resources in the shape of pictures and symbols have been designed for use in low-tech solutions such as communication books and boards, and high-level technologies such as computer programs and eye-tracking devices.",
        "AAC resources at hand are, however, burdened by two major problems.",
        "First, manual production requires much effort and time.",
        "New concepts have to be identified and a uniform agreement has to be reached among different parties on how to visually present the concept.",
        "Second, accessibility in the sense of a consumer's or developer's possibility and freedom to use available resources, is strongly restricted by distribution, copyright and licensing issues.",
        "Different projects have been carried out with the goal to develop and implement some suggested open standards for syntactic and semantic encoding of AAC material.",
        "The European IST project WWAAC (World Wide Augmentative & Alternative Communication, 2004) was a pan-european initiative to make the web more accessible for a wide range of persons with language and/or cognitive impairments.",
        "An essential part of language lies within its ambiguity on the lexical as well as structural level.",
        "When it comes to computerized processing, semantic variation between word forms, morphological relationships within different word forms, and multiword items claim specific handling, especially when enriching an existing vocabulary with new entries.",
        "In fact, comparing wordlists and frequencies from different sources is a task affected by a couple of complications.",
        "One problem encountered in a comparative study of word frequencies is how a word is defined, which in fact has been put under debate by for instance Gardner (2007).",
        "In the present study, we consider the lemma, i.e. the look up form of a word, to be the key unit.",
        "The idea behind the use of lemma frequencies as units of study is that the human mental or computational processing of lemmas and inflected forms profit from each other, which is in favour of a theory implying that a morphological decomposition takes place for the recognition of inflected forms.",
        "Knowledge of the vocabulary is an essential part of both conveying and understanding messages, verbally as well as non-verbally.",
        "Together with the system of rules generating grammatical combinations, the words in the vocabulary contribute to the infinite expressive power of language.",
        "With a narrow vocabulary, the possible means to produce and achieve adequate information decreases.",
        "Researchers have attempted to identify lists of words that could be included in a core vocabulary (Thorndike and Lorge, 1944), (Spache, March 1953) and more specifically for people who use AAC (Balandin and Iacono, 1998), (Banajee et al., 2003).",
        "There have also been efforts to investigate how much of the vocabulary a person needs to know in order to grasp the content of written texts without having to struggle with isolated, unknown words (Hirsch and Nation, 1992).",
        "In the latter study, a list of around 2,000 high frequency words of English, compiled by West (1953), was used in order to investigate if knowledge of these words was actually sufficient for reading unsimplified short novels.",
        "It was found that a person with this restricted vocabulary was familiar with about 90-92% of the total words.",
        "It is worth noting that the word frequency counts here reflect the number of times a word pertaining to a certain word family occurs in a text.",
        "The idea behind a word family is that inflected and regulary derived forms of a known base word can also be considered as known words if the affixes are known.",
        "This implies that nouns, adverbs, verbs and adjectives sharing a common base will be treated as one word, contrary to the lexicographical traditions (for Swedish), where the lemma or base form is the conventional unit of study.",
        "With this in mind, it follows that a database containing a core vocabulary of a language has to contain enough information for identification of different lexemes.",
        "For our purposes in this study, it was also necessary to add another source of information in order to retrieve the semantic identifiers for subsequent illustration of different concepts into AAC symbols."

        "The candidates retrieved by excerption of high-frequency lemmas from the corpus were subsequently compared to the base-form words in a Swedish base vocabulary, where the lemmas obtaining the highest rank in both sets were integrated into a database of core vocabulary.",
        "The AAC symbol coverage of these database entries was then assessed by addressing an existing AAC symbol database.",

        "Some of the symbols are produced in order to illustrate different concepts rather than isolated words, which to some extent had a negative impact on the comparison of different wordlists.",
        "The focus of interest has been on content words, i.e. nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs, since the functional words normally don't appear as independent items.",

        "It is a specialized corpus of 1.3 million tokens, compiled with the objective to mirror simple vocabulary and syntax.",
        "The main text types include works from different domains and genres, such as fiction, official documents from the government, parliament, county council, municipality and daily news.",
        "The common denominator for all the texts is that they are all intended to be read by persons that do not fully master everyday Swedish language.",
        "The size of the corpus, 1.3 million tokens, was compensated for by making text representativeness be decisive during compilation.",
        "The supply of easy-to-read material is limited and subsequently, the variation range is quite narrow.",
        "Contrary to many other writing tasks, the production of easy-to-read text is elicited by a specific need from the society and we cannot expect a large variety of genres.",
        "Three genres of easy-to-read texts were identified for obtaining a representative sample, namely fiction, news and community information, which for the target group of readers can be regarded as being a balanced corpus.",
        "SUC 2.0 is a balanced corpus of 1 million words in written Swedish, originating from the 1990's.",
        "It is designed according to the Brown corpus (Francis and Kucera, 1979) and LOB corpus (Johansson et al., 1978) principles, which means that it consists of 500 samples of text with a length of about 2,000 words each.",
        "The state-of-the-art markup language at the time of compilation was SGML, and this annotation schema is kept also in the acctual, revised version.",
        "All entries are annotated with parts-of-speech, morphological analysis and lemma, or rather base form.",
        "The corpus is also provided with a wide range of structural tags and functionally interpreted tags, according to the TEI standards Sperberg, (Consortium, TEI, 2007).",
        "At the lexeme level, about 23% of the SUC corpus is covered by nouns, while verbs amounts to 17%, adjectives to 9%, proper nouns to 4%, adverbs to 9%, prepositions 12%, conjunctions 8%, numbers 2%, pronouns 10% and determiners to 6% of the total words.",
        "The total vocabulary has 69,371 base forms.",
        "The wordlist obtained from the LäSBarT corpus, LäSBarT-listan (henceforward referred to as LBL) contains 22,041 lemmas in total, covering 43,364 lexemes, proper nouns excluded.",
        "It contains information about lexical frequency, baseform, part-of-speech tag, and lemma/lexeme form.",
        "The lemma/lexeme information tells us that a word like sticka has three different lemma/lexeme forms, namely sticka.1 for the noun sticka 'splinter; knitting needle', and sticka.2 or sticka.3 for the two different verb lexemes with the meanings 'prick, sting; put' and 'knit', respectively.",

        "In this study, 2,277 verbs, 14,856 nouns, 2,715 adjectives and 1,030 adverbs were extracted for further analysis.",
        "It is interesting to note a large discrepancy in verbal representation between SUC (17 %) and LäSBarT (25 %).",
        "The most probable explanation to this is the tendency among authors of easy-to-read texts to paraphrase a complicated sentence by two or more simpler ones, each necessitating a new head verb.",
        "The Swedish base lemma vocabulary pool (henceforward referred to as SBV) (Forsbom, 2006) is derived from the SUC corpus.",
        "The units of the SBV are the base forms from SUC annotation disambiguated for part-of-speech.",
        "This means for example that a polysemous and homonymous word pertaining to different parts-of-speech such as a noun and a verb is represented both as its nominal and its verbal form.",
        "No information is, however, given at the lexeme or semantic level.",
        "The version presently used contains 8,215 entries, where the lemmas are ranked according to relative frequency weighted with dispersion, i.e. how evenly spread-out they are across the sub-corpora.",
        "Instead of using frequency alone, the formula for adjusted frequency calculation was used (Rosengren, 1972):",

        "While Princeton WordNet and its descendant Swedish WordNet (Viberg et al., 2002), are organized in encoded concepts in terms of sets of synonyms, called synsets, the associative relations between the entries in SALDO are based on metaphorical kinships that are specified as strictly hierarchical structures.",
        "Every entry in SALDO must have a mother, which in practice often is either a hyperonym or a synonym.",
