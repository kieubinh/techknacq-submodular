        "The device can potentially be used both as a literacy learning tool and an interactive communication aid for people with literacy difficulties.",
        "We will discuss how NLP technologies, such as speech synthesis and predictive techniques, are utilised to improve the usability of the device."

        "Many aspects of the system design are inspired by a series of experiments on using prestored utterances in public goal-oriented situations when the prestored message did not exactly match what the user wanted to say.",
        "In addition to the script structures, we show system messages that are not anticipated to be perfect/complete for what is needed and strategies of use with stored messages that anticipate the communication partner's follow-up to utterances (adjacency pairs)."
