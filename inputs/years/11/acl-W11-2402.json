        "Textual Entailment was proposed as a generic paradigm for applied semantic inference (Dagan et al., 2006).",
        "Given two textual fragments, termed hypothesis (H) and text (T), the text is said to textually entail the hypothesis (T â€“ H) if a person reading the text can infer the meaning of the hypothesis.",
        "Since it was first introduced, the six rounds of the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) challenges have become a standard benchmark for entailment systems.",
        "Entailment systems apply various techniques to tackle this task, including logical inference (Tatu and Moldovan, 2007; MacCartney and Manning, 2007), semantic analysis (Burchardt et al., 2007) and syntactic parsing (Bar-Haim et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009).",
        "Inference at these levels usually requires substantial processing and resources, aiming at high performance.",
        "Nevertheless, simple lexical level entailment systems pose strong baselines which most complex entailment systems did not outperform (Mirkin et al., 2009a; Majumdar and Bhat-tacharyya, 2010).",
        "Additionally, within a complex system, lexical entailment modeling is one of the most effective component.",
        "Finally, the simpler lexical approach can be used in cases where complex systems cannot be used, e.g. when there is no parser for a targeted language.",
        "For these reasons lexical entailment systems are widely used.",
        "They derive sentence-level entailment decision base on lexical-level entailment evidence.",
        "Typically, this is done by quantifying the degree of lexical coverage of the hypothesis terms by the text terms (where a term may be multi-word).",
        "A hypothesis term is covered by a text term if either they are identical (possibly at the stem or lemma level) or there is a lexical entailment rule suggesting the entailment of the former by the latter.",
        "Such rules are derived from lexical semantic resources, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), which capture lexical entailment relations.",
        "Common heuristics for quantifying the degree of coverage are setting a threshold on the percentage of coverage of H 's terms (Majumdar and Bhat-tacharyya, 2010), counting the absolute number of uncovered terms (Clark and Harrison, 2010), or applying an Information Retrieval-style vector space similarity score (MacKinlay and Baldwin, 2009).",
        "Other works (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005; Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006) have applied heuristic formulas to estimate the similarity between text fragments based on a similarity function between their terms.",
        "The above mentioned methods do not capture several important aspects of entailment.",
        "Such aspects include the varying reliability levels of entailment resources and the impact of rule chaining and multiple evidence on entailment likelihood.",
        "An additional observation from these and other systems is that their performance improves only moderately when utilizing lexical-semantic resources.",
        "We believe that the textual entailment field would benefit from more principled models for various entailment phenomena.",
        "In this work we formulate a concrete generative probabilistic modeling framework that captures the basic aspects of lexical entailment.",
        "A first step in this direction was proposed in Shnarch et al.",
        "(2011) (a short paper), where we presented a base model with a somewhat complicated and difficult to estimate extension to handle coverage.",
        "This paper extends that work to a more mature model with new extensions.",
        "We first consider the \"logical\" structure of lexical entailment reasoning and then interpret it in probabilistic terms.",
        "Over this base model we suggest several extensions whose significance is then assessed by our evaluations.",
        "Learning the parameters of a lexical model poses a challenge since there are no lexical-level entailment annotations.",
        "We do, however, have sentence-level annotations available for the RTE data sets.",
        "To bridge this gap, we formulate an instance of the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977) to estimate hidden lexical-level entailment parameters from sentence-level annotations.",
        "Overall, we suggest that the main contribution of this paper is in presenting a probabilistic model for lexical entailment.",
        "Such a model can better integrate entailment indicators and has the advantage of being able to utilize well-founded probabilistic methods such as the EM algorithm.",
        "Our model's performance is in line with the best entailment systems, while opening up directions for future improvements."

        "We next review several entailment systems, mostly those that work at the lexical level and in particular those with which we compare our results on the RTE data sets.",
        "The 5th Recognizing Textual Entailment challenge (RTE-5) introduced a new pilot task (Ben-tivogli et al., 2009) which became the main task in RTE-6 (Bentivogli et al., 2010).",
        "In this task the goal is to find all sentences that entail each hypothesis in a given document cluster.",
        "This task's data sets reflect a natural distribution of entailments in a corpus and demonstrate a more realistic scenario than the earlier RTE challenges.",
        "As reviewed in the following paragraphs there are several characteristic in common to most entailment systems: (1) lexical resources have a minimal impact on their performance, (2) they heuristically utilize lexical resources, and (3) there is no principled method for making the final entailment decision.",
        "The best performing system of RTE-5 was presented by Mirkin et.",
        "al (2009a).",
        "It applies supervised classifiers over a parse tree representations to identify entailment.",
        "They reported that utilizing lexical resources only slightly improved their performance.",
        "MacKinlay and Baldwin (2009) presented the best lexical-level system at RTE-5.",
        "They use a vector space method to measure the lexical overlap between the text and the hypothesis.",
        "Since usually texts of RTE are longer than their corresponding hypotheses, the standard cosine similarity score came out lower than expected.",
        "To overcome this problem they suggested a simple ad-hoc variant of the cosine similarity score which removed from the text all terms which did not appear in the corresponding hypothesis.",
        "While this heuristic improved performance considerably, they reported a decrease in performance when utilizing synonym and derivation relations from WordNet.",
        "On the RTE-6 data set, the syntactic-based system of Jia et.",
        "al (2010) achieved the best results, only slightly higher than the lexical-level system of (Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010).",
        "The latter utilized several resources for matching hypothesis terms with text terms: WordNet, VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), utilizing two of its relations, as well as an acronym database, number matching module, co-reference resolution and named entity recognition tools.",
        "Their final entailment decision was based on a threshold over the number of matched hypothesis terms.",
        "They found out that hypotheses of different length require different thresholds.",
        "While the above systems measure the number of hypothesis terms matched by the text, Clark and Harrison (2010) based their entailment decision on the number of mismatched hypothesis terms.",
        "They utilized both WordNet and the DIRT paraphrase database (Lin and Pantel, 2001).",
        "With WordNet, they used one set of relations to identify the concept of a term while another set of relations was used to identify entailment between concepts.",
        "Their results were inconclusive about the overall effect of DIRT while WordNet produced a net benefit in most configurations.",
        "They have noticed that setting a global threshold for the entailment decision, decreased performance for some topics of the RTE-6 data set.",
        "Therefore, they tuned a varying threshold for each topic based on an idiosyncracy of the data, by which the total number of entailments per topic is approximately a constant.",
        "Glickman et al.",
        "(2005) presented a simple model that recasted the lexical entailment task as a variant of text classification and estimated entailment probabilities solely from co-occurrence statistics.",
        "Their model did not utilize any lexical resources.",
        "In contrary to these systems, our model shows improvement when utilizing high quality resources such as WordNet and the CatVar (Categorial Variation) database (Habash and Dorr, 2003).",
        "As Majum-dar and Bhattacharyya (2010), our model considers the impact of hypothesis length, however it does not require the tuning of a unique threshold for each length.",
        "Finally, most of the above systems do not differentiate between the various lexical resources they use, even though it is known that resources reliability vary considerably (Mirkin et al., 2009b).",
        "Our probabilistic model, on the other hand, learns a unique reliability parameter for each resource it utilizes.",

        "Our base model follows the one presented in (Shnarch et al., 2011), which is described here in detail to make the current paper self contained.",
        "We first specify the process by which a decision of lexical entailment between T and H using knowledge resources should be determined, as illustrated in Figure 1 (a general description on the left and a concrete example on the right).",
        "There are two ways by which a term h G H is entailed by a term t G T .A direct MATCH is the case in which t and h are identical terms (possibly at the stem or lemma level).",
        "Alternatively, lexical entailment can be established based on knowledge of entailing lexicalsemantic relations, such as synonyms, hypernyms and morphological derivations, available in lexical resources.",
        "These relations provide lexical entailment rules, e.g. Jaguar â€“ car.",
        "We denote the resource which provided the rule r by R(r).",
        "It should be noticed at this point that such rules specify a lexical entailment relation that might hold for some (T, H) pairs but not necessarily for all pairs, e.g. the rule Jaguar â€“ car does not hold in the wildlife context.",
        "Thus, the application of an available rule to infer lexical entailment in a given ( T, H) pair might be either valid or invalid.",
        "We note here the difference between covering a term and entailing it.",
        "A term is covered when the available resources suggest its entailment.",
        "However, since a rule application may be invalid for the particular (T, H) context, a term is entailed only if there is a valid rule application from T to it.",
        "Entailment is a transitive relation, therefore rules may compose transitive chains that connect t to h via intermediate term(s) t (e.g. crowd â€“ social group â€“ people).",
        "For a chain to be valid for the current ( T, H) pair, all its composing rule applications should be valid for this pair.",
        "This corresponds to a logical AND gate (omitted in Figure 1 for visual clarity) which takes as input the validity values (1/0) of the individual rule applications.",
        "Next, multiple chains may connect t to h (as for tj and hj in Figure 1) or connect several terms in T to h (as ti and tj are indicating the entailment of hj in Figure 1), thus providing multiple evidence for h's entailment.",
        "For a term h to be entailed by T it is enough that at least one of the chains from T to h would be valid.",
        "This condition is realized in the model by an OR gate.",
        "Finally, for T to lexically entail H it is usually assumed that every h g H should be entailed by T (Glickman et al., 2006).",
        "Therefore, the final decision follows an AND gate combining the entailment decisions for all hypothesis terms.",
        "Thus, the 1-bit outcome of this gate y corresponds to the sentence-level entailment status.",
        "When assessing entailment for (T, H) pair, we do not know for sure which rule applications are valid.",
        "Taking a probabilistic perspective, we assume a parameter Or for each resource R, denoting its reliability, i.e. the prior probability that applying a rule from",
        "R for an arbitrary (T, H) pair corresponds to valid entailment.",
        "Under this perspective, direct MATCHs are considered as rules coming from a special \"resource\", for which Omatch is expected to be close to 1.",
        "Additionally, there could be a term h which is not covered by any of the resources at hand, whose coverage is inevitably incomplete.",
        "We assume that each such h is covered by a single rule coming from a dummy resource called UNCOVERED, while expecting Ouncovered to be relatively small.",
        "Based on the Or values we can now estimate, for each entailment inference step in Figure 1, the probability that this step is valid (the corresponding bit is 1).",
        "Equations (1) - (3) correspond to the three steps in calculating the probability for entailing a hypothesis.",
        "First, Eq.",
        "(1) specifies the probability of a particular chain c, connecting a text term t to a hypothesis term h, to correspond to a valid entailment between t and h. This event is denoted by t - â€“ c h and its probability is the joint probability that the applications of all rules r G c are valid.",
        "Note that every rule r in a chain c connects two terms, its left-hand-side L and its right-hand-side R. The left-hand-side of the first rule in c is t g T and the right-hand-side of the last rule in it is h g H. Let us denote the event of a valid rule application by L â€“ â€“ â–  R. Since a-priori a rule r is valid with probability 0R(r), and assuming independence of all r g c, we obtain Eq.",
        "(1).",
        "Next, Eq.",
        "(2) utilizes Eq.",
        "(1) to specify the probability that T entails h (at least by one chain).",
        "Let C (h) denote the set of chains which suggest the entailment of h. The requested probability is equal to 1 minus the probability of the complement event, that is, T does not entail h by any chain.",
        "The latter probability is the product of probabilities that all chains c g C (h) are not valid (again assuming independence of chains).",
        "Finally, Eq.",
        "(3) gives the probability that T entails all of H (T â€“ H), assuming independence of H 's terms.",
        "This is the probability that every h g H is entailed by T, as specified by Eq.",
        "(2).",
        "Altogether, these formulas fall out of the standard probabilistic estimate for the output of AND and OR gates when assuming independence amongst their input bits.",
        "As can be seen, the base model distinguishes varying resource reliabilities, as captured by Or, decreases entailment probability as rule chain grows, having more elements in the product of Eq.",
        "(1), and increases it when entailment of a term is supported by multiple chains with more inputs to the OR gate.",
        "Next we describe two extensions for this base model which address additional important phenomena of lexical entailment.",
        "Based on term-level decisions for the entailment of each h g H, the model has to produce a sentence-level decision of T â€“ H. In the model described so far, for T to entail H it must entail all its terms.",
        "This demand is realized by the AND gate at the bottom of Figure 1.",
        "In practice, this demand is too strict, and we would like to leave some option for entailing H even if not every h g H is entailed.",
        "Thus, it is desired to relax this strict demand enforced by the AND gate in the model.",
        "The Noisy-AND model (Pearl, 1988), depicted in Figure 2, is a soft probabilistic version of the AND gate, which is often used to describe the interaction between causes and their common effect.",
        "In this variation, each one of the binary inputs bi,bn of the AND gate is first joined with a \"noise\" bit xi by an OR gate.",
        "Each \"noise\" bit is 1 with probability p, which is the parameter of the gate.",
        "The output bit y is defined as:",
        "and the conditional probability for it to be 1 is:",
        "If all the binary input values are 1, the output is deterministically 1.",
        "Otherwise, the probability that the output is 1 is proportional to the number of ones in the input, where the distribution depends on the parameter p. In case p = 0 the model reduces to the regular AND.",
        "In our model we replace the final strict AND with a noisy-AND, thus increasing the probability of T to entail H, to account for the fact that sometimes H might be entailed from T even though some h g H is not directly entailed.",
        "The input size n for the noisy-AND is the length of the hypotheses and therefore it varies from H to H. Had we used the same model parameter p for all lengths, the probability to output 1 would have depended solely on the number of 0 bits in the input without considering the number of ones.",
        "For example, the probability to entail a hypothesis with 10 terms given that 8 of them are entailed by T (and 2 are not) is p. The same probability is obtained for a hypothesis of length 3 with a single entailed term.",
        "We, however, expect the former to have a higher probability since a larger portion of its terms is entailed by T.",
        "There are many ways to incorporate the length of a hypothesis into the noisy-AND model in order to normalize its parameter.",
        "The approach we take is defining a separate parameter pn for each hypothesis length n such that pn = 0%A, where 0Na becomes the underlying parameter value of the noisy-AND, i.e.",
        "This way, if non of the hypothesis terms is entailed, the probability for its entailment is 0Na, independent of its length:",
        "As can be seen from Figure 1, replacing the final AND gate by a noisy-AND gate is equivalent to adding an additional chain to the OR gate of each hypothesis term.",
        "Therefore we update Eq.",
        "(2) to:",
        "In the length-normalized noisy-AND model the value of the parameter p becomes higher for longer hypotheses.",
        "This increases the probability to entail such hypotheses, compensating for the lower probability to strictly entail all of their terms.",
        "The second extension of the base model follows our observation that the prior validity likelihood for a rule application, increases as more of H's terms are covered by the available resources.",
        "In other words, if we have a hypothesis Hi with k covered terms and a hypothesis H2 in which only j < k terms are covered, then an arbitrary rule application for Hi is more likely to be valid than an arbitrary rule application for H2.",
        "We chose to model this phenomenon by normalizing the reliability OR of each resource according to the number of covered terms in H. The normalization is done in a similar manner to the length-normalized noisy-AND described above, obtaining a modified version of Eq.",
        "(1):",
        "#covered",
        "As a results, the larger the number of covered terms is, the larger OR values our model uses and, in total, the entailment probability increases.",
        "To sum up, we have presented the base model, providing a probabilistic estimate for the entailment status in our generation process specified in 3.1.",
        "Two extensions were then suggested: one that relaxes the strict AND gate and normalizes this relaxation by the length of the hypothesis; the second extension adjusts the validity of rule applications as a function of the number of the hypothesis covered terms.",

        "CatVar is a database of clusters of uninflected words (lexemes) and their categorial (i.e. part-of-speech) variants (e.g. announce (verb), announcer and an-nouncement(noun) and announced (adjective)).",
        "We deduce an entailment relation between any two lexemes in the same cluster.",
        "Model's parameters were estimated from the development set, taken as training.",
        "Based on these parameters, the entailment probability was estimated for each pair (T, H) in the test set, and the classification threshold was tuned by classification over the development set.",
        "We next present our evaluation results.",
        "First we investigate the impact of utilizing lexical resources and of chaining rules.",
        "In section 5.2 we evaluate the contribution of each extension of the base model and in Section 5.3 we compare our performance to that of state-of-the-art entailment systems.",
        "As mentioned in Section 2, in the RTE data sets it is hard to show more than a moderate improvement when utilizing lexical resources.",
        "Our analysis ascribes this fact to the relatively small amount of rule applications in both data sets.",
        "For instance, in RTE-6 there are 10 times more direct matches of identical terms than WordNet and CatVar rule applications combined, while in RTE-5 this ratio is 6.",
        "As a result the impact of rule applications can be easily shadowed by the large amount of direct matches.",
        "Table 1 presents the performance of our (full) model when utilizing no resources at all, WordNet, CatVar and both, with chains of a single step.",
        "We also considered rule chains of length up to 4 and present here the results of 2 chaining steps with WordNet-2 and (WordNet+CatVar)-2.",
        "Overall, despite the low level of rule applications, we see that incorporating lexical resources in our model significantly and quite consistently improves performance over using no resources at all.",
        "Naturally, the optimal combination of resources may vary somewhat across the data sets.",
        "In RTE-6 WordNet-2 significantly improved performance over the single-stepped WordNet.",
        "However, mostly chaining did not help, suggesting the need for future work to improve chain modeling in our framework.",
        "We next assess the impact of each of our proposed extensions to the base probabilistic model.",
        "To that end, we incorporate WordNet+CatVar (our best configuration above) as resources for the base model (Section 3.1) and compare it with the noisy-AND extension (Eq.",
        "(2*)), the covered-norm extension which normalizes the resource reliability parameter by the number of covered terms (Eq.",
        "(1 *)) and the full model which combines both extensions.",
        "Table 2 presents the results: both noisy-AND and covered-norm extensions significantly increase Fiover the base model (by 4.5-8.4 points).",
        "This scale of improvement was observed with all resources and chain-length combinations.",
        "In both data sets, the combination of noisy-AND and covered-norm extensions in the full model significantly outperforms each of them separately, showing their complementary nature.",
        "We also observed that applying noisy-AND without the hypothesis length normalization hardly improved performance over the base model, emphasising the importance of considering hypothesis length.",
