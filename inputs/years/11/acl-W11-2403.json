        "Textual inference is prevalent in text understanding applications.",
        "For example, in Question Answering (QA) the expected answer should be inferred from retrieved passages, and in Information Extraction (IE) the meaning of the target event is inferred from its mention in the text.",
        "Lexical inferences make a substantial part of the inference process.",
        "In such cases, a target term is inferred from text expressions based on either one of two types of lexical matches: (i) a direct match of the target term in the text.",
        "For instance, the IE event injure may be detected by finding the word injure in the text; (ii) an indirect match, through a term that implies the meaning of the target term, e.g. inferring injure from hurt.",
        "In either case, due to word ambiguity, it is necessary to validate that the context of the match conforms with the intended meaning of the target term before carrying out an inference operation based on this match.",
        "For example, \"You hurt my feelings\" constitutes an invalid context for the injure event as hurt in this text does not refer to a physical injury.",
        "Similarly, inferring the protest-related event demonstrate based on demo is deemed invalid although demo implies the meaning of the word demonstrate in other contexts, e.g., concerning software demonstration.",
        "Although seemingly equivalent, a closer look reveals that the above two examples correspond to two distinct contextual mismatch situations.",
        "While the match of hurt is invalid for injure in the particular given context, an inference based on demo is invalid for the protest demonstrate event in any context.",
        "Thus, several types of context matching are involved in textual inference.",
        "While most prior work addressed only specific context matching scenarios, Szpektor et al.",
        "(2008) presented a broader view, proposing a generic framework for context matching in inference, termed Contextual Preferences (CP).",

        "Word ambiguity has been traditionally addressed through Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) (Nav-igli, 2009).",
        "The WSD task requires selecting the meaning of a target term from amongst a predefined set of senses, based on sense-inventories such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "An alternative approach eliminates the reliance on such inventories.",
        "Instead of explicit sense identification, a direct sense-match between terms is pursued (Dagan et al., 2006).",
        "Lexical substitution (McCarthy and Navigli, 2009) is probably the most commonly known task that follows this approach.",
        "Context matching is a generalization of lexical substitution, which seeks a match between terms in context, not necessarily for the purpose of substitution.",
        "For instance, the word played in \"U2 played their first-ever concert in Russia\" contextually matches music, although music cannot substitute played in this context.",
        "The context matching task, therefore, is to determine (by quantifying or giving a binary decision) the validity of a match between two terms in context.",
        "In Section 1 we informally presented two cases of contextual mismatches.",
        "A comprehensive view of context matching types is provided by the Contextual Preferences framework (Szpektor et al., 2008).",
        "CP is phrased in terms of the Textual Entailment (TE) paradigm (Dagan et al., 2009).",
        "In TE, a text t entails a textual hypothesis h if the meaning of h can be inferred from t. Formulating the IE example from Section 1 within TE, h may be the name of the target event, injure, and t is a text segment from which h can be inferred.",
        "A direct match occurs when a term in h is identical to a term in t. An inference based on an indirect match is viewed as the application of a lexical entailment rule, r, such as 'hurt => injure', where the entailing left-hand side (LHS) of the rule (hurt) is matched in the text, while the entailed right-hand side (RHS), injure, is matched in the hypothesis.",
        "Hence, three inference objects take part in inference operations: t, h and r. Most prior work addressed only specific contextual matches between these objects.",
        "For example, Harabagiu et al.",
        "(2003) matched the contexts of t and h for QA (answer and question, respectively); Barak et al.",
        "(2009) matched t and h (document and category) in TC, while other works, including those applying lexical substitution, typically validated the context match between t and r (Kauchak and Barzilay, 2006; Dagan et al., 2006; Pantel et al., 2007; Connor and Roth, 2007).",
        "In comparison, in the CP framework, all possible contextual matches among t, h and r are considered: t – h, t – r and r – h. The three context matches are depicted in Figure 1 (left).",
        "In CP, the representation of each inference object is enriched with contextual information which is used to characterize its valid contexts.",
        "Such information may be the words of the event description in IE, corpus instances based on which a rule was learned, or an annotation of relevant WordNet senses in Name-based TC.",
        "For example, a category name hockey may be assigned with the sense number corresponding to ice hockey, but not to field hockey, in order to designate information that limits the valid contexts of the category to the former among the two meanings of the name.",
        "Before an inference operation is performed, the context representations of each pair among the participating objects should be matched by a context model in order to assess the contextual validity of the operation.",
        "Along with the context representation and the specific context matching models, the way context model decisions are combined needs to be specified in a concrete implementation of the CP framework.",
        "Several approaches were taken in prior work to model context matching, mostly within the scope of learning selectional preferences of templatized lexical-syntactic rules (e.g. 'X – – hit Y' =>",
        "'X < – – attack Y').",
        "Pantel et al.",
        "(2007) and Szpektor et al.",
        "(2008) represented the context of such rules as the intersection of preferences of the rule s LHS and RHS, namely the observed argument instantiations or their semantic classes.",
        "A rule is deemed applicable to a given text if the argument instantiations in the text are similar to the selectional preferences of the rule.",
        "To overcome sparseness, other works represented context in latent space.",
        "Pennacchiotti et al.",
        "(2007) and Szpektor et al.",
        "(2008) measured the similarity between the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al., 1990) representations of matched contexts.",
        "Dinu and La-pata (2010) used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) to model templates latent senses, determining rule applicability based on the similarity between the two sides of the rule when instantiated by the context, while Ritter et al.",
        "(2010) used LDA to model argument classes, considering a rule valid for a given argument instantiation if its instantiated templates are drawn from the same hidden topic.",
        "A different approach is provided by classification-based models which learn classifiers for inference objects.",
        "A classifier is trained based on positive and negative examples which represent valid or invalid contexts of the object; from those, features characterizing the context are extracted, e.g. words in a window around the target term or syntactic links with it.",
        "Given a new context, the classifier assesses its validity with respect to the learned classification model.",
        "Classifiers in prior work were applied to determine rule applicability in a given context (t – r).",
        "Training a classifier for word paraphrasing, Kauchak and Barzilay (2006) used occurrences of the rule's RHS as positive context examples, and randomly picked negative examples.",
        "A similar approach was applied by Dagan et al.",
        "(2006), which used a single-class SVM to avoid selecting negative examples.",
        "In both works, a resulting classifier represents a word with all its senses intermixed.",
        "Clearly, this poses no problem for monosemous words, but is biased towards the more common senses of polysemous words.",
        "Indeed, Dagan et al.",
        "(2006) report a negative correlation between the degree of polysemy of a word and the performance of its classifier.",
        "Connor and Roth (2007) used per-rule classifiers to produce a noisy training set for learning a global classifier for verb substitution.",
        "In this work we follow the classification-based approach which seems appealing for several reasons.",
        "Figure 1: Left: An illustration of the CP relationships as in (Szpektor et al., 2008), with arrows indicting the context matching direction; Right: The application of classifiers to the tested contexts under our scheme.",
        "First, it allows seamlessly integrating various types of information via classifiers' features; unlike some of the above models, it is not inherently dependent on the type of rules that are utilized and easily accommodates to both lexical and lexical-syntactic rules through the choice of features.",
        "In addition, it does not rely on a predefined similarity measure and provides flexibility in terms of model's parameters.",
        "Finally, this approach captures the notion of directionality which is fundamental in textual inference, and is therefore better suited to applied inference than previously proposed symmetric context models.",
        "In comparison to prior classification-based models, our approach addresses all three context matches specified by CP, rather than only the rule-text match.",
        "It is not limited to substitutable terms or even to terms with the same part of speech.",
        "In addition, we avoid learning a classifier for all senses combined, but rather learn it for the specific intended meaning.",
        "Name-based TC (Gliozzo et al., 2009) is an unsupervised setting of Text Categorization in which the only input provided is the category name, e.g. trade, 'mergers and acquisitions' or guns.",
        "When category names are ambiguous, e.g. space, categories are not well defined; thus, auxiliary information is expected to accompany the name for disambiguation, such as a list of relevant senses or a category description.",
        "Typically, unsupervised TC consists of two steps.",
        "First, an unsupervised method is applied to an unlabeled corpus, automatically labeling some of the documents to categories.",
        "Then, the labeled documents from the first step are used to train a supervised TC classifier which is used to label any document in the test set (Gliozzo et al., 2009; Downey and Etzioni, 2009; Barak et al., 2009).",
        "In this work we focus on the above unsupervised step.",
        "Gliozzo et al.",
        "(2009) addressed this task by representing both documents and categories by LSA vectors which implicitly capture contextual similarities between terms.",
        "Each document was then assigned to the most similar category based on cosine similarity between the LSA vectors.",
        "Barak et al.",
        "(2009) required an occurrence of a term entailing the category name (or the category name itself) in order to regard the category as a candidate for the document.",
        "To assess the contextual validity of the match, they used LSA document-category similarity as in (Gliozzo et al., 2009).",
        "For example, to classify a document into the category medicine, at least one lexical entailment rule, e.g. 'drug => medicine', should be matched in the document.",
        "Then, the validity of drug for medicine in the matched document is assessed by the LSA context model.",

        "s requirement for a match for the category in the document, but address context matching in an entirely different way.",
        "Name-based TC provides a convenient setting for evaluating context matching approaches for two main reasons.",
        "First, all types of context matchings are realized in this application (see Section 3); second, as the hypothesis consists of a single term or a few terms, the TC gold standard annotation corresponds quite directly to the context matching task for lexical inferences; in other applications where longer hypotheses are involved, context matching performance may be masked by other factors."

        "This stems from the need to consider directionality in context matching.",
        "For instance, a text about football typically constitutes a valid context for the more general sports context, but not vice versa.",
        "Indeed, directionality may be captured in vector-space models by using a directional similarity measure (Kotlerman et al., 2010), but only symmetric measures were used in context matching work so far.",
        "Based on this distinction between the inference objects roles, we present a novel scheme that uses two types of classifiers to represent context:",

        "We do that by applying a similar procedure which uses cohyponyms of the seeds, e.g. baseball for hockey or islam for christianity.",
        "Cohyponymy is a non-entailing relation; hence, by using it we expect to obtain semantically-related, yet invalid contexts.",
        "If not enough negative examples are retrieved using cohyponyms, we select the remaining required examples randomly.",
        "As the distribution of positive and negative examples in the data is unknown, we set the ratio of negative to positive examples as a parameter of the model, as in (Bergsma et al., 2008).",
        "When the number of training examples for a rule or a category is below a certain minimum, the resulting classifier is expected to be of poor quality.",

        "On the other hand, non ambiguous rules, e.g. 'warship => ship' are assigned a high probability (1.0), and so are rules whose LHS is ambiguous but its dominant sense in the training corpus is the same one the rule refers to, e.g. 'margin => earnings'''(0.85).",
        "We do not assign negative classifier scores to invalid matches but rather set them to zero instead.",

        "Specifically, the model assigns a new weight wd (u) to a matching term u in the document vector D based on the model's assessment of: (a) t – h, the context match between the (match in the) document and the category; and (if an indirect match) (b) t – r, the context match between the document and the rule 'u => Cj', where c G C. The model also sets a new weight wC(v) to a term v in the category vector C based on the context match for r – h, between the rule 'v => Cj ' (cj G C) and the category.",
        "For instance, using our context matching scheme in TC, wD(u) is set to Ch(u) or Ch(u)+Cr(u) for direct and indirect matches, respectively; wC(v) is left as 1 if v G C and set to Ch(v) when v G E.",

        "We used the Apte split of the Reuters-21578 collection, often used in TC tasks.",

        "The 20-Newsgroups (20NG) corpus is a collection of newsgroup postings gathered from twenty different categories from the Usenet Newsgroups hierarchy.",
        "We used the \"by-date\" version of the corpus, which contains approximately 20,000 documents partitioned (nearly) evenly across the categories and divided in advance to training (60%) and test (40%) sets.",
        "As in (Gliozzo et al., 2009; Barak et al., 2009), we adjusted non-standard category names (e.g. forsale was renamed to sale) and manually specified for each category its relevant WordNet senses.",

        "Tuning of the self-supervised context model s parameters (number of training examples, negative to positive ratio, feature set and the way negative examples are obtained) was performed over development sets sampled from the training sets.",
        "Based on this tuning, some parameters varied between the datasets and between classifier types (Ch vs. Cr).",

        "The limited performance of Crmay be related to higher ambiguity in rules relative to category names, resulting in noisier training data.",

        "With the rule-set we used in this experiment, the recall upper bound was 59.1% for R10 and 40.6% for 20NG.",
        "However, rule coverage affects precision as well: In many cases documents are assigned to incorrect categories because the correct category is not even a candidate as no entailing term was matched for it in the document.",

        "This is a challenging task that requires further research.",
        "Although useful for some classifier types, the use of cohyponyms may retrieve potentially positive examples as negative ones, since terms that are considered cohyponyms in WordNet are often perceived as near synonyms in common usage, e.g. buyout and purchase in the context of acquisitions.",
        "Likewise, using WordNet senses to determine ambiguity is also inaccurate.",
        "Rare or too fine-grained senses, common in WordNet, cause a term to be considered ambiguous, which in turn triggers the use of less accurate retrieval methods.",
        "For example, auction has a bridge-related WordNet sense which is irrelevant for our dataset, but made the term be considered ambiguous.",
        "This calls for development of other methods for determining word ambiguity, which consider the actual usage of terms in the domain rather than relying solely on WordNet."
