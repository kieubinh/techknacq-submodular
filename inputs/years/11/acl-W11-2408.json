        "Reasoning about ordinary human situations and activities requires the availability of diverse types of knowledge, including expectations about the probable results of actions and the lexical entailments for many predicates.",
        "We describe initial work to acquire such a collection of conditional (if-then) knowledge by exploiting presuppositional discourse patterns (such as ones involving 'but', 'yet', and 'hoping to') and abstracting the matched material into general rules."

        "We are interested, ultimately, in enabling an inference system to reason forward from facts as well as backward from goals, using lexical knowledge together with world knowledge.",
        "Creating appropriate collections of general world knowledge to support reasoning has long been a goal of researchers in Artificial Intelligence.",
        "Efforts in information extraction, e.g., Banko et al.",
        "(2007), have focused on learning base facts about specific entities (such as that Barack Obama is president), and work in knowledge extraction, e. g., Van Durme and Schubert (2008), has found generalizations (such as that a president may make a speech).",
        "While the latter provides a basis for pos-sibilistic forward inference (Barack Obama probably makes a speech at least occasionally) when its meaning is sharpened (Gordon and Schubert, 2010), these resources don't provide a basis for saying what we might expect to happen if, for instance, someone crashes their car.",
        "That the driver in a car crash might be injured and the car damaged is a matter of common sense, and, as such, is rarely stated directly.",
        "However, it can be found in sentences where this expectation is disconfirmed: 'Sally crashed her car into a tree, but she wasn't hurt.'",
        "We have been exploring the use of lexico-syntactic discourse patterns indicating disconfirmed expectations, as well as people's goals ('Joe apologized repeatedly, hoping to be forgiven').",
        "The resulting rules, expressed at this point in natural language, are a first step toward obtaining classes of general conditional knowledge typically not obtained by other methods."

        "One well-known approach to conditional knowledge acquisition is that of Lin and Pantel (2001), where inference rules are learned using distributional similarity between dependency tree paths.",
        "These results include entailment rules like 'x is the author of y o x wrote y' (which is true provided x is a literary work) and less dependable ones like 'x caused y o y is blamed on x'.",
        "This work was refined by Pantel et al.",
        "(2007) by assigning the x and y terms semantic types (inferential selectionalpreferences - ISP) based on lexical abstraction from empirically observed argument types.",
        "A limitation of the approach is that the conditional rules obtained are largely limited to ones expressing some rough synonymy or similarity relation.",
        "Pekar (2006) developed related methods for learning the implications of an event based on the regular co-occurrence of two verbs within \"locally coherent text\", acquiring rules like 'x was appointed as y' suggests that 'x became y', but, as in dirt, we lack information about the types of x and y, and only acquire binary relations.",

        "If we were to treat this as a case of disconfirmed expectation as above, we would have claimed that If a male is very clever, then he may not be eccentric'.",
        "To identify this special use of 'but', we consult a lexicon of sentiment annotations, SentiWordNet (Baccianella et al., 2010).",

        "While we currently use eight query patterns, future work may add rules to cover more constructions.",

        "Enabling an inference system to reason about common situations and activities requires more types of general world knowledge and lexical knowledge than are currently available or have been targeted by previous work.",
        "We've suggested an initial approach to acquiring rules describing complex consequences or reasons and subtle relations among adjectival attributes: We find possible rules by looking at interesting discourse patterns and rewriting them as conditional expressions based on semantic patterns.",
        "A natural question is why we don't use the machine-learning/bootstrapping techniques that are common in other work on acquiring rules.",
        "These techniques are particularly successful when (a) they are aimed at finding fixed types of relationships, such as hyponymy, near-synonymy, part-of, or causal relations between pairs of lexical items (often nominals or verbs); and (b) the fixed type of relationship between the lexical items is hinted at sufficiently often either by their co-occurrence in certain local lexico-syntactic patterns, or by their occurrences in similar sentential environments (distributional similarity).",
        "But in our case, (a) we are looking for a broad range of (more or less strong) consequence relationships, and (b) the relationships are between entire clauses, not lexical items.",
        "We are simply not likely to find multiple occurrences of the same pair of clauses in a variety of syntactic configurations, all indicating a consequence relation - you're unlikely to find multiple redundant patterns relating clauses, as in Went up to the door but didn't knock on it'.",
        "There is more work to be done to arrive at a reliable, inference-ready knowledge base of such rules.",
        "The primary desideratum is to produce a logical representation for the rules such that they can be used in the Epilog reasoner (Schubert and Hwang, 2000).",
        "Computing logical forms (as, e. g., in Bos (2008)) and then deriving logically formulated rules from these rather than deriving sentential forms directly from text should also allow us to be more precise about dropping modifiers, reshaping into generic present tense from other tenses, and other issues that affect the quality of the statements.",
        "We have a preliminary version of a logical form generator that derives LFs from TreeBank parses that can support this direction.",
        "Further filtering techniques (based both on the surface form and the logical form) should keep the desired inference rules while improving quality."
