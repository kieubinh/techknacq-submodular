        "The categorical distributional compositional model of meaning of Coecke et al.",
        "(2010) combines the modularity of formal semantic models with the empirical nature of vector space models of lexical semantics.",
        "The meaning of a sentence is defined to be the application of its grammatical structure – represented in a type-logical model – to the kronecker product of the meanings of its words, as computed in a distributional model.",
        "The concrete and experimental consequences of this setting, and other models that aim to bring together the logical and distributional approaches, are active topics in current natural language semantics research, e.g. see (Grefenstette et al., 2011; Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011; Clark et al., 2010; Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Guevara, 2010; Mitchell and La-pata, 2008).",
        "In this paper, we focus on our recent concrete Dis-CoCat model (Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011) and in particular on nouns composed with transitive verbs.",
        "Whereby the meaning of a transitive sentence 'sub tverb obj' is obtained by taking the componentwise multiplication of the matrix of the verb with the kronecker product of the vectors of subject and object:",
        "In most logical models, transitive verbs are modeled as relations; in the categorical model the relational nature of such verbs gets manifested in their matrix representation: if subject and object are each r-dimensional row vectors in some space N, the verb will be a r x r matrix in the space N <g> N. There are different ways of learning the weights of this matrix.",
        "In (Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011), we developed and implemented one such method on the data from the British National Corpus.",
        "The matrix of each verb was constructed by taking the sum of the kronecker products of all of the subject/object pairs linked to that verb in the corpus.",
        "We refer to this method as the indirect method.",
        "This is because the weight Cij is obtained from the weights of the subject and object vectors (computed via co-occurrence with bases ~n i and ~n j respectively), rather than directly from the context of the verb itself, as would be the case in lexical distributional models.",
        "This construction method was evaluated against an extension of Mitchell and Lapata (2008)'s disambiguation task from intransitive to transitive sentences.",
        "We showed and discussed how and why our method, which is moreover scalable and respects the grammatical structure of the sentence, resulted in better results than other known models of semantic vector composition.",
        "As a motivation for the current paper, note that there are at least two different factors at work in Equation (1): one is the matrix of the verb, denoted by tverb, and the other is the kronecker product of subject and object vectors sub <g) obj.",
        "Our model's mathematical formulation of composition prohibits us from changing the latter kronecker product, but the 'content' of the verb matrices can be built through different procedures.",
        "In recent work we used a standard lexical distributional model for nouns and engineered our verbs to have a more sophisticated structure because of the higher dimensional space they occupy.",
        "In particular, we argued that the resulting matrix of the verb should represent 'the extent according to which the verb has related the properties of subjects to the properties of its objects', developed a general procedure to build such matrices, then studied their empirical consequences.",
        "One question remained open: what would be the consequence of starting from the standard lexical vector of the verb, then encoding it into the higher dimensional space using different (possibly ad-hoc but nonetheless interesting) mathematically inspired methods.",
        "In a nutshell, the lexical vector of the verb is de-> noted by tverb and similar to vectors of subject and object, it is an r-dimensional row vector.",
        "Since the kronecker product of subject and object (sub <g) obj) is r x r, in order to make tverb applicable in Equation 1, i.e. to be able to substitute it for tverb, we need to encode it into a r x r matrix in the N <g> N space.",

        "All vectors were built from a lemmatised version of the BNC.",
        "The noun basis was the 2000 most common context words, basis weights were the probability of context words given the target word divided by the overall probability of the context word.",
        "These features were chosen to enable easy comparison of our experimental results with those of Mitchell and Lapata's original experiment, in spite of the fact that there may be more sophisticated lexical distributional models available.",
        "Task This is an extension of Mitchell and Lapata (2008)'s disambiguation task from intransitive to transitive sentences.",
        "The general idea behind the transitive case (similar to the intransitive one) is as follows: meanings of ambiguous transitive verbs vary based on their subject-object context.",
        "For instance the verb 'meet' means 'satisfied' in the context 'the system met the criterion' and it means 'visit', in the context 'the child met the house'.",
        "Hence if we build meaning vectors for these sentences compositionally, the degrees of synonymity of the sentences can be used to disambiguate the meanings of the verbs in them.",
        "Suppose a verb has two meanings a and b and that it has occurred in two sentences.",
        "Then if in both of these sentences it has its meaning a, the two sentences will have a high degree of synonymity, whereas if in one sentence the verb has meaning a and in the other meaning b, the sentences will have a lower degree of synonymity.",
        "For instance 'the system met the criterion' and 'the system satisfied the criterion' have a high degree of semantic similarity, and similarly for 'the child met the house' and 'the child visited the house'.",
        "This degree decreases for the pair 'the child met the house' and 'the child satisfied the house'.",
        "Dataset The dataset is built using the same guidelines as Mitchell and Lapata (2008), using transitive verbs obtained from CELEX paired with subjects and objects.",
        "We first picked 10 transitive verbs from the most frequent verbs of the BNC.",
        "For each verb, two different non-overlapping meanings were retrieved, by using the JCN (Jiang Conrath) information content synonymity measure of WordNet to select maximally different synsets.",
        "For instance for 'meet' we obtained 'visit' and 'satisfy'.",
        "For each original verb, ten sentences containing that verb with the same role were retrieved from the BNC.",
        "Examples of such sentences are 'the system met the criterion' and 'the child met the house'.",
        "For each such sentence, we generated two other related sentences by substituting their verbs by each of their two synonyms.",
        "For instance, we obtained 'the system satisfied the criterion' and 'the system visited the criterion' for the first meaning and 'the child satisfied the house' and 'the child visited the house' for the second meaning .",
        "This procedure provided us with 200 pairs of sentences.",
        "The dataset was split into four non-identical sections of 100 entries such that each sentence appears in exactly two sections.",
        "Each section was given to a group of evaluators who were asked to assign a similarity score to simple transitive sentence pairs formed from the verb, subject, and object provided in each entry (e.g. 'the system met the criterion' from 'system meet criterion').",
        "The scoring scale for human judgement was [1, 7], where 1 was most dissimilar and 7 most identical.",
        "Separately from the group annotation, each pair in the dataset was given the additional arbitrary classification of HIGH or LOW similarity by the authors.",
        "Evaluation Method To evaluate our methods, we first applied our formulae to compute the similarity of each phrase pair on a scale of [0,1] and then compared it with human judgement of the same pair.",
        "The comparison was performed by measuring Spearman's p, a rank correlation coefficient ranging from 1 to 1.",
        "This provided us with the degree of correlation between the similarities as computed by our model and as judged by human evaluators.",
        "Following Mitchell and Lapata (2008), we also computed the mean of HIGH and LOW scores.",
        "However, these scores were solely based on the authors' personal judgements and as such (and on their own) do not provide a very reliable measure.",
        "Therefore, like Mitchell and Lapata (2008), the models were ultimately judged by Spearman's p.",
        "The results are presented in table 4.",
        "The additive and multiplicative rows have, as composition operation, vector addition and component-wise multiplication.",
        "The Baseline is from a non-compositional approach; it is obtained by comparing the verb vectors of each pair directly and ignoring their subjects and objects.",
        "The UpperBound is set to be inter-annotator agreement.",
        "The indirect matrix performed better than the vectors encoded in diagonal matrices padded with 0 and 1.",
        "However, surprisingly, the kronecker product of this vector with itself provided better results than all the above.",
