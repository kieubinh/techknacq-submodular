        "The translation quality of SMT approaches heavily depends on the amount and coverage of the bilingual language resources available to train the statistical models.",
        "There are several data collection initiatives amassing and distributing large amounts of textual data.",
        "For frequently used language pairs like French-English, large-sized text data sets are readily available.",
        "However, for less frequently used language pairs, only a limited amount of bilingual resources are available, if any at all.",
        "In order to overcome language resource limitations, recent research on multilingual SMT focuses on the use of pivot languages (de Gispert and Marino, 2006; Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Wu and Wang, 2007; Bertoldi et al., 2008; Koehn et al., 2009).",
        "Instead of a direct translation between two languages where only a limited amount of bilingual resources is available, the pivot translation approach makes use of a third language that is more appropriate due to the availability of more bilingual corpora and/or its relatedness to the source/target language.",
        "In most of the previous research, English has been the pivot language of choice due to the richness of available language resources.",
        "However, recent research on pivot translation has shown that the usage of non-English pivot languages can improve translation quality of certain language pairs, especially when translating from or into Asian languages (Paul et al., 2009).",
        "This paper focuses on the translation of dialects, i.e., a variety of a language that is characteristic of a particular group of the language's speakers, into a foreign language.",
        "A standard dialect (or standard language) is a dialect that is recognized as the \"correct\" spoken and written form of the language.",
        "Dialects typically differ in terms of morphology, vocabulary and pronunciation.",
        "Various",
        "'lDC: http://www.ldc.upenn.edu, ELRA: http://www.elra.info",
        "methods have been proposed to measure relatedness between dialects using phonetic distance measures (Nerbonne and Heeringa, 1997), string distance algorithms (Heeringa et al., 2006; Scherrer, 2007), or statistical models (Chitturi and Hansen, 2008).",
        "Concerning data-driven natural language processing (NLP) applications like machine translation (MT), however, linguistic resources and tools usually are available for the standard language, but not for dialects.",
        "In order to create dialect language resources, previous research utilized explicit knowledge about the relation between the standard language and the dialect using rule-based and statistical models (Habash et al., 2005; Sawaf, 2010).",
        "In addition, applying the linguistic tools for the standard language to dialect resources is often insufficient.",
        "For example, the task of word segmentation, i.e., the identification of word boundaries in continuous text, is one of the fundamental preprocessing steps of MT applications.",
        "In contrast to Indo-European languages like English, many Asian languages like Japanese do not use a whitespace character to separate meaningful word units.",
        "However, the application of a linguistically motivated standard language word segmentation tool to a dialect corpus results in a poor segmentation quality due to morphological differences in verbs and adjectives, thus resulting in a lower translation quality for SMT systems that acquire the translation knowledge automatically from a parallel text corpus (Paul et al., 2011).",
        "This paper differs from previous research in the following aspects:",
        "• it reduces the data sparseness problem of direct translation approaches by translating a resource-limited dialect language into a foreign language by using the resource-rich standard language as the pivot language.",
        "• it is language independent and acquires knowledge about the relation between the standard language and the dialect automatically.",
        "• it avoids segmentation mismatches between the input and the translation model by mapping the characterized dialect language, i.e., each character is treated as a single token, to the word segmentation of the standard language using a Bayesian co-segmentation model.",
        "• it reduces the translation task complexity by using monotone decoding techniques.",
        "• it reduces the number of features in the loglinear model that have to be estimated from bilingual data.",
        "The details of the proposed dialect translation method are described in Section 2.",
        "Experiments were carried out for the translation of four Japanese dialects (Kumamoto, Kyoto, Okinawa, Osaka) into four Indo-European languages (English, German, Russian, Hindi) and two Asian languages (Chinese, Korean).",
        "The utilized language resources and the outline of the experiments are summarized in Section 3.",
        "The results reveal that the integration of Bayesian co-segmentation models with pivot-based SMT improves the translation quality of dialect to foreign language translation tasks and that the proposed system outperforms standard pivot translation approaches concatenating SMT engines that translate the dialect into the standard language and the standard language MT output into the foreign language for the majority of the investigated language pairs."

        "Spoken language translation technologies attempt to bridge the language barriers between people with different native languages who each want to engage in conversation by using their mother-tongue.",
        "For standard languages, multilingual speech translation services like the VoiceTra system for travel conversations are readily available.",
        "However, such technologies are not capable of dealing with dialect languages due to the lack of language resources and the high development costs of building speech translation components for a large number of dialect variations.",
        "In order to reduce such problems, the dialect translation method proposed in this paper integrates two different methods of transducing a given dialect input sentence into a foreign language.",
        "In the first step, the close relationship between the local and standard language is exploited to directly map character sequences in the dialect input to word segments in the standard language using a Bayesian cosegmentation approach, details of which are given in Section 2.1.",
        "The proposed transliteration method is described in Section 2.2.",
        "The advantages ofthe proposed Bayesian co-segmentation approach are two fold: it reduces the translation complexity and it avoids segmentation inconsistencies between the input and the translation models.",
        "In the second step, a state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT system trained on a large amount of bilingual data is applied to obtain high-quality foreign language translations as described in Section 2.3.",
        "The method for mapping the dialect sentences into the standard language word segments is a direct character-to-character mapping between the languages.",
        "This process is known as transliteration.",
        "Many transliteration methods have previously been proposed, including methods based on string-similarity measures between character sequences (Noeman and Madkour, 2010) or generation-based models (Lee and Chang, 2003; Tsuji and Kageura, 2006; Jiampojamarn et al., 2010).",
        "In this paper, we use a generative Bayesian model similar to the one from (DeNero et al., 2008) which offers several benefits over standard transliteration techniques: (1) the technique has the ability to train models whilst avoiding over-fitting the data, (2) compact models that have only a small number of well-chosen parameters are constructed, (3) the underlying generative transliteration model is based on the joint source-channel model (Li et al., 2004), and (4) the model is symmetric with respect to source and target language.",
        "Intuitively, the model has two basic components: a model for generating an outcome that has already been generated at least once before, and a second model that assigns a probability to an outcome that has not yet been produced.",
        "Ideally, to encourage the reuse of model parameters, the probability of generating a novel bilingual sequence pair should be considerably lower then the probability of generating a previously observed sequence pair.",
        "The probability distribution over these bilingual sequence pairs (including an infinite number of unseen pairs) can be learned directly from unlabeled data by Bayesian inference of the hidden co-segmentation of the corpus.",
        "The co-segmentation process is driven by a",
        "Dirichlet process, which is a stochastic process defined over a set S (in our case, the set of all possible bilingual sequence pairs) whose sample path is a probability distribution on S. The underlying stochastic process for the generation of a corpus composed of bilingual phrase pairs (sk,tk) can be written in the following form:",
        "G is a discrete probability distribution over all the bilingual sequence pairs according to a Dirichlet process prior with a base measure G0 and concentration parameter a.",
        "The concentration parameter a > 0 controls the variance of G; intuitively, the larger a is, the more similar Go will be to G.",
        "For the base measure that controls the generation of novel sequence pairs, we use a joint spelling model that assigns probability to new sequence pairs according to the following joint distribution:",
        "where |s| and |t| are the length in characters of the source and target sides ofthe bilingual sequence pair; vs and vt are the vocabulary sizes of the source and target languages respectively; and As and At are the expected lengths ofthe source and target.",
        "According to this model, source and target sequences are generated independently: in each case the sequence length is chosen from a Poisson distribution, and then the sequence itself is generated given the length.",
        "Note that this model is able to assign a probability to arbitrary bilingual sequence pairs of any length in the source and target sequence, but favors shorter sequences in both.",
        "The generative model is given in Equation 3.",
        "The equation assigns a probability to the kth bilingual sequence pair (sk, tk) in a derivation of the corpus, given all of the other sequence pairs in the history so far (s_k, t_k).",

        "For more details on the Bayesian co-segmentation process, please refer to (Finch and Sumita, 2010).",
        "A Bayesian segmentation model is utilized to transform unseen dialect sentences into the word segmentation of the standard language by using the joint-source channel framework proposed by (Li et al., 2004).",
        "The joint-source channel model, also called the n-gram transliteration model, is a joint probability model that captures information on how the source and target sentences can be generated simultaneously using transliteration pairs, i.e., the most likely sequence of source characters and target words according to a joint language model built from the co-segmentation from the Bayesian model.",

        "Then, an n-gram transliteration model is defined as the transliteration probability of a transliteration pair < l, s >k depending on its immediate n preceding transliteration pairs:",
        "For the experiments reported in this paper, we implemented the joint-source channel model approach as a weighted finite state transducer (FST) using the OpenFst toolkit (Allauzen et al., 2007).",
        "The FST takes the sequence of dialect characters as its input and outputs the co-segmented bilingual segments from which the standard language segments are extracted.",
        "Recent research on speech translation focuses on corpus-based approaches, and in particular on statistical machine translation (SMT), which is a machine translation paradigm where translations are generated on the basis of statistical models whose parameters are derived from the analysis of bilingual text corpora.",
        "SMT formulates the problem of translating a source language sentence src into a target language sentence trg as a maximization problem of the conditional probability:",
        "where p(src|trg) is called a translation model (TM) and represents the generation probability from trg into src, and p(trg) is called a language model (LM) and represents the likelihood ofthe target language (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "During the translation process (decoding), a score based on the statistical model probabilities is assigned to each translation hypothesis and the one that gives the highest probability is selected as the best translation.",
        "The translation quality of SMT approaches heavily depends on the amount and coverage ofthe bilingual language resources available to train the statistical models.",
        "In the context of dialect translation, where only few bilingual language resources (if any at all) are available for the dialect and the foreign language, only a relatively low translation quality can be obtained.",
        "In order to obtain better translations, we apply a pivot translation approach.",
        "Pivot translation is the translation from a source language (SRC) to a target language (TRG) through an intermediate pivot (or bridging) language (PVT).",

        "Within the SMT framework, various coupling strategies like cascading, phrase-table composition, or pseudo-corpus generation have been proposed.",
        "For the experiments reported in this paper, we utilized the cascading approach because it is computational less expensive, but still performs comparably well compared to the other pivot translation approaches.",
        "In the first step, the dialect input is transcribed into the standard language as described in Section 2.1.",

        "The overall gains of the proposed method compared to (a) the direct translation approach (see Table 2) and (b) the SMT-based pivot translation approach (see Table 3) are summarized in Table 6.",
        "The results show that the BCS-based pivot translation approach also largely outperforms the direct translation approach, gaining 5.9%~25.3% BLEU points.",
        "Comparing the two pivot translation approaches, the proposed BCS-based pivot translation method gains up to 0.8% BLEU points over the concatenation of SMT engines for the Indo-European target languages, but is not able to improve the translation quality for translating into Korean and Chinese.",
        "Interestingly, the SMT-based pivot translation approach seems to be better for language pairs where only small relative gains from the pivot translation approach are achieved when translating the dialect into a foreign language.",
        "For example, Korean is a language closely related to Japanese and the SMT models from the small data condition already seem to cover enough information to successfully translate the dialect languages into Korean.",
        "In the case of Chinese, the translation quality for even the large data condition SMT engines is relatively low.",
        "Therefore, improving the quality of the standard language input might have only a small impact on the overall pivot translation performance, if any at all.",
        "On the other hand, the proposed method can be successfully applied for the translation oflan-guage pairs where structural differences have a large impact on the translation quality.",
        "In such a translation task, the more accurate transduction of the dialect structure into the standard language can affect the overall translation performance positively."

        "Experiments were carried out for the translation of four Japanese dialects into four Indo-European as well as into two Asian languages.",
        "The results revealed that the Bayesian co-segmentation method largely improves the quality of the standard language sentence generated from a dialect input compared to SMT-based translation approaches.",
        "Although significant improvements of up to 0.8% in BLEU points are achieved for certain target languages, such as all of the investigated Indo-European languages, it is difficult to transfer the gains obtained by the Bayesian co-segmentation model to the outcomes for the pivot translation method.",
        "Further research will have to investigate features like language relatedness, structural differences, and translation model complexity to identify indicators of translation quality that could enable the selection of BCS-based vs. SMT-based pivot translation approaches for specific language pairs to improve the overall system performance further.",
        "In addition we would like to investigate the effects of using the proposed method for translating foreign languages into dialect languages.",
        "As the Bayesian co-segmentation model is symmetric with respect to source and target language, we plan to reuse the models learned for the experiments presented in this paper and hope to obtain new insights into the robustness of the Bayesian co-segmentation method when dealing with noisy data sets like machine translation outputs."
