        "Small, manually assembled corpora may be available for less dominant languages and dialects, but producing web-scale resources remains a challenge.",
        "Even when considerable quantities of text are present on the web, finding this text, and distinguishing it from related languages in the same region can be difficult.",
        "For example less dominant variants of English (e.g. New Zealander, Singaporean, Canadian, Irish, South African) may be found under their respective national domains, but will be partially mixed with Englishes of the British and US varieties, perhaps through syndication of journalism, or the local reuse of text by multinational companies.",
        "Less formal dialectal usage may be scattered more widely over the internet through mechanisms such as wiki or blog authoring.",
        "Here we automatically construct a corpus of Hiberno-English (English as spoken in Ireland) using a variety of methods: filtering by national domain, filtering by orthographic conventions, and bootstrapping from a set of Ireland-specific terms (slang, place names, organisations).",
        "We evaluate the national specificity of the resulting corpora by measuring the incidence of topical terms, and several grammatical constructions that are particular to Hiberno-English.",
        "The results show that domain filtering is very effective for isolating text that is topic-specific, and orthographic classification can exclude some non-Irish texts, but that selected seeds are necessary to extract considerable quantities of more informal, dialectal text."

        "For less dominant language variants, corpora are usually painstakingly constructed by hand.",
        "This results in high quality collections of text, classified and balanced by genre, register and modality.",
        "But the process is time-consuming and expensive, and results in relatively small resources.",
        "For example the International Corpus of English (ICE) project (Greenbaum, 1996) has already resulted in the publication of corpora covering ten dialects of English, following a common schema, but the individual corpora are limited to approximately one million words.",
        "An alternative is to use automatic methods to harvest corpora from the Web.",
        "Identification of major languages is a robust technology, and where the regional boundaries of a language or dialect correspond closely to a national top-level internet domain, very large collections (of several billion words) can now can be produced easily, with close to no manual intervention (Baroni et al., 2009).",
        "These methods can also deal with some issues of text quality found on the web, successfully extracting coherent pieces of running text from web pages (i.e. discarding menu text, generic headings, copyright and other legal notices), reducing textual duplication, and identifying spam, portal pages and other files that do not contain linguistically interesting text.",
        "Corpora of minor languages that lack their own domain, but that have clear orthographic differences from more dominant neighbouring languages can be collected automatically by using a small set of seed documents, from which language-specific search terms can be extracted (Scannell, 2007).",
        "These methods, combined with automated language identification methods, can quickly produce large, clean collections with close to no manual intervention.",
        "However for language variants that do not have their own domain (e.g. Scots, Bavarian), it is less clear that such web corpora can be automatically constructed.",
        "Smaller or politically less dominant countries that do have their own domain (e.g. Belgium, New Zealand), may also find the language of their \"national\" web strongly influenced by other language varieties, for example through syndication of journalistic articles, or materials published by foreign companies.",
        "In this paper we use minimally supervised methods (Baroni and Bernardini, 2004; Baroni et al., 2009) to quickly and cheaply build corpora of Hiberno-English (English as spoken in Ireland), which are many times larger than ICE-Ireland, the largest published collection currently available (Kallen and Kirk, 2007).",
        "We investigate several combinations of strategies (based on domain names, and on regional variations in vocabulary and orthography) to distinguish text written in this minor language variant from related dominant variants (US and UK English).",
        "We validate the specificity of the resulting corpora by measuring the incidence of Ireland-specific language, both topically (the frequency with which Irish regions and organisations are mentioned), and structurally, by the presence of grammatical constructions that are particular to Hiberno-English.",
        "We also compare our corpus to another web-corpus of Hiberno-English that is in development (Crûbadân, Scannell, personal communication) that relies on domain filtering of crawled web-pages.",
        "The results show that filtering by national domain is very effective in identifying text that deals with Irish topics, but that the grammar of the resulting text is largely standard.",
        "Using a set of seed terms tailored to the language variant (Irish slang, names of Ireland-based organisations, loanwords from Irish Gaelic), yields text which is much more particular to Hiberno-English usage.",
        "At the same time, such tailored seed terms increase the danger of finding \"non-authentic\" uses of Irishisms (sometimes termed paddywhackery or oirish), either in fictional dialogues, or in documents discussing distinctive patterns in Irish English.",
        "The application of a British/American spelling filter has less clear effects, increasing topical incidence slightly, while reducing structural incidences somewhat.",
        "The paper proceeds as follows: in the next section we introduce Hiberno-English, situating it relative to other variants of English, and concentrating on the characteristic features that will be used as metrics of \"Irishness\" of text retrieved from the Web.",
        "Next we describe the process by which several candidate corpora of Hiberno-English were constructed (section 3), and the methods we used to quantify incidence of distinctive usage (section 4).",
        "In the final two sections we compare the incidence of these markers with those found in corpora of other variants of English (UK, US), Scannell's IE-domain filtered corpus, and a hand-crafted corpus of Hiberno-English (ICE-Ireland), and reflect on the wider applicability of these methods to variants of other languages and orthographies."

      "text": [
        "Hiberno-English differs in a range of ways from other varieties of English.",
        "In broad terms it can be grouped with British English, in that its lexicon, grammar and orthographic conventions are more similar to that of Great Britain, than to that of North America.",
        "For example with lexical variants such as bumper/fender, rubbish bin/trash can, lift/elevator and zed/zee it shares the former British usage rather than the latter American usage, though there are exceptions (in Irish usage the North Americans term truck is replacing the British lorry).",
        "Similarly in syntax it tends to follow British conventions, for instance He's familiar with X rather than X is familiar to him, write to me rather than write me and the acceptability of singular verbal marking with group subjects, as in the team are pleased - though there are counterexamples again, in that Irish English tends to follow American dialects in dispensing with the shall/will distinction.",
        "Most obviously, Irish writing uses British spellings rather than American spellings.",
        "However, there are still dialectal differences between Irish and British English.",
        "Beyond the usual regional differences that one might find between the words used in different parts of England, the English spoken in Ireland is particularly influenced by the Irish language (Gaelic, Gaeilge) (Kirk and Kallen, 2007).",
        "While English is the first language of the overwhelming majority of residents of Ireland (estimates of Irish mother-tongue speakers are of the order of 50,000, or about 1% of the population), Irish retains status as the first official language of the Republic of Ireland, maintained as a core subject at all levels of school education, and through state-maintained radio and television channels.",
        "As recently as the early 19th century, Irish was the majority language, and so many traces of it remain in modern Hiberno-English, in the form of Irish loanwords (e.g. slân 'goodbye', gaelscoil 'Irish (speaking) school'), Anglicizations (e.g. 'gansey', jumper, from Irish geansal), and composites (e.g. 'jack-een', a pejorative term for Dubliners, combining the Irish diminutive In with the English 'Jack').",
        "In this paper we take a series of characteristic terms and structures from Hiberno-English, mostly inspired by (Kirk and Kallen, 2007), and use them as markers of the Irishness of the text we assemble from the web.",
        "While there are many more interesting grammatical differences between Hiberno-English and other variants (e.g. perfective use of the simple present: I know that family for years), we restrict ourselves to those that can be automatically identified in a corpus through searching of plain text, or of shallow syntactic patterns (parts of speech).",
        "The first marker we use is to measure the incidence of a set of terms that are topically related to Ireland: proper names of Ireland-based organisations, and geographical terms.",
        "The method for assembling this list is described in section 4.",
        "The most simple structure that we use as a marker of Hiberno-English is the contraction I amn't (I'm not or Iain t in other varieties).",
        "The next is the \"after\" perfective, which often expresses immediacy, and a negative outcome:",
        "(1) I'm after losing my wallet 'I just lost my wallet'",
        "A further structure that is novel from the point of view of other variants of English is a particular use of verbs that take a complement that expresses a question (most commonly ask, wonder, see and know), without the use of a complementizer such as ifor whether and with an inversion of subject-verb order (typical of interrogatives):",
        "'I wonder if/whether he is coming'",
        "Finally we consider the expanded usage of reflexive pronouns in Hiberno-English, where they may be used for emphasis, in any argument position, and without being anaphorically bound, as is usually required.",
        "Here we limit ourselves to subject position reflexives, which can be identified from word order patterns, without any deeper semantic analysis:",
        "(3) himself is in big trouble 'he is in big trouble'",
        "With the exception of the amn t contraction, all of these phenomena are demonstrated by (Kirk and Kallen, 2007) to be common in the ICE-Ireland corpus, though somewhat less common in Northern Irish portion of that collection, and to be very rare or completely absent in the ICE-GB corpus of the English of Britain (Nelson et al., 2002).",
        "Significantly, these constructions are found predominantly in the spoken language portion of the ICE-Ireland corpus, suggesting that speakers are perhaps aware that they are not \"standard\" English, and so not considered appropriate in the written register."

        "Within the WaCky initiative (Web-as-Corpus kool ynitia-tive) (Baroni and Bernardini, 2006) a community of linguists and information technology specialists developed a set of tools to selectively crawl sections of the Web, and then process, index and search the resulting data.",
        "Contributions like BootCaT (Baroni and Bernardini, 2004), an iterative procedure to bootstrap specialised corpora and terms from the Web, have been successfully used in a range of projects: first in the construction of the WaCky corpora, a collection of very large (>1 billion words) corpora of English (ukWaC), German (deWaC) and Italian (itWaC); and subsequently by other groups, e.g. noWaC and jpWaC (Baroni et al., 2009; Guevara, 2010; Erjavec et al., 2008).",
        "Here we use BootCaT to build seven prototype corpora of Hiberno-English, and evaluate the dialect-specificity of each by measuring the incidence of proper terms and constructions that are associated with this language variant.",
        "Additionally, we use ukWaC as the de-facto standard British English Web corpus, and construct a medium size web-corpus of the US domain to represent American usage.",
        "Each corpus is preprocessed and formatted for the IMS Open Corpus Workbench (CWB, (Christ, 1994; Web, 2008)), a generic query engine for large text corpora that was developed for applications in computational lexicography.",
        "BootCaT first takes a set of manually assembled seed terms, these (possibly multi-word) terms are randomly combined, and then are used as search queries with a Web search engine; the HTML documents of the top results are downloaded and cleaned to extract running text and discard all web-markup.",
        "Preprocessing and formatting for the CWB consists of tokenising, lemmatising, and part-of-speech tagging the corpus, and then converting the result into CWB's internal format; we replicated the processing stages employed for ukWaC.",
        "The construction of the nine corpora differs on three dimensions:",
        "Seeds: two seed sets were used namely, an Hiberno-English one (IEs), and the original ukWaC list of mid-frequency terms (UKs) from the British National Corpus (Burnard, 1995); the Irish seeds were used in pairs and triples to attempt to vary the degree of regional specificity.",
        "TLDs: two types of top-level internet domain (TLD) restrictions were imposed during (or after) the construction of the corpora; either no restriction was imposed (.ALL), or a corpus was filtered by a specific national TLD (e.g. .ie).",
        "Spelling: two types of spelling filter were imposed; either none, or an 'orthographic convention factor' (OCF) was calculated to detect American and British spellings, and a corpus was filtered accordingly (BrEn).",
        "The IE seeds contained 81 seed terms, gathered using one author's native intuition, and words indicated as being specific to Irish English by the Oxford English Dictionary, and from various Web pages about Hiberno-English.",
        "76 single-word and 5 two-word terms were used falling into three main categories: Irish place names, regional variant terms (mostly slang), and load words from Irish Gaelic (many being state institutions).",
        "The full listing of terms is given here:",
        "Place names: Dublin, Galway, Waterford, Drogheda, Antrim, Derry, Kildare, Meath, Donegal, Armagh, Wexford, Wicklow, Louth, Kilkenny, Westmeath, Offaly, Laois, Belfast, Cavan, Sligo, Roscommon, Monaghan, Fermanagh, Carlow, Longford, Leitrim, Navan, Ennis, Tralee, Leinster, Connaught, Munster, Ulster",
        "Regional variants: banjaxed (wrecked), craic (fun), fecking (variant of fucking), yoke (thing), yer man/one/wan (that man/woman), culchie (country dweller), da (father), footpath (pavement), gaff (home), gobshite (curse), gurrier (young child), jack-een (Dubliner), jacks (toilet), janey mac (exclamation), jaysus (variant of exclamation \"jesus\"), kip (sleep; hovel), knacker (Traveller, gypsy), knackered (wrecked), langer (penis; idiot), langers/langered (drunk), scallion (spring onion), skanger (disgusting person), strand (beach, seaside), scuttered (drunk), boreen (small road), gob (mouth; spit), eejit (variant of idiot), lough (lake), fooster (dawdle), barmbrack (traditional Hallow'een cake), shebeen (unlicensed bar), bogman (contry dweller), old one (old lady), quare (variant queer), gansey (pullover)",

        "For 3T this resulted in over 80% 3-tuples with 3 single-word terms, and slightly over 17% with 2 single-word terms, and the remaining percentages for 3-tuples with 1 single-word and no single-word terms; for 2T this resulted in almost 88% 2-tuples with 2 single-word terms, almost 12% with only 1 single-word terms, and less than 1% with no singleword terms.",
        "The UK seeds were the original ones used during the construction of the ukWaC corpus and they were combined into 3000 3-tuple search queries.",
        "No TLD restriction means that the search engine was not instructed to return search results within a specific domain, and hence, documents originate from typical English-language domains (.com, .ie, .uk, etc.)",

        "The number of term intersections with each list is counted and OCF is calculated as the difference between counts over their sum.",
        "To simplify matters, we utilised a spell-checker to return the list of known words from a document, this corresponds to checking a document for spelling errors and only keeping the non-erroneous words.",
        "In our case we used an en_GB dictionary, an en_US one, and the two together.",
        "The three lists yield the needed numbers of words only known by one of the two dictionaries, and, hence unknown by the other dictionary, and the ratio in the range of [-1, + 1] can be calculated.",
        "The search engine we used for all queries was Yahoo (Yahoo!",

        "Several corpora were constructed from the Irish seeds using 2 or 3-tuple search terms: either without restricting the TLDs; subsequent restriction to the .ie TLD; or subsequent filtering according to spelling.",

        "Unsurprisingly, web authors in the US and UK domains do not write often about Irish places and organisations.",
        "But constructions that are putatively exclusive to Hiberno-English are seldom found.",
        "Those that are found might be explained by the effect of language contact with Irish immigrants to those countries, and the fact that text by Irish authors may be found in these domains, whether those people are resident in those countries or not.",
        "For instance in the example below, the given name Ronan suggests that the author might be of Irish extraction:",

        "The sets headed \".ie\" show the figures for the corpora we constructed by querying seed terms within the Irish national domain.",
        "The incidence of characteristic features of Hiberno-English grammar are higher than those seen in the US and UK domains, similar to that seen in the Crûbadân corpus, and lower than in the ICE-Ireland corpus, perhaps reflecting the fact that these constructions are less common in written Hiberno-English.",
        "Subsequent filtering out of pages with dominance of American English spelling (\".ie, BrEn\") does not have much effect on the numbers.",
        "The \"Irish Seeds (IEs)\" bars show that the use of tailored seed terms returns text which has a similar topical specificity to that in the .ie domain generally, but which shows more structural characteristics of Hiberno-English.",
        "These results can also be improved upon, first by concentrating on the .ie domain portion of the tailored-seeds extracted pages (\"Irish Seeds (IEs), IE Dom (.ie)\") which boosts topical specificity.",
        "Filtering instead by orthography (\"IEs, BrEn\") seems to strike a happy medium, increasing incidence in all categories.",
        "However returning to table 1, it is apparent that there are many false positives among the constructions found using Irish seed terms.",
        "This was caused by the search strategy retrieving a small number of pages on the topic of Hiberno-English, that contained many constructed examples of the structures of interest.",
        "The same corpora contained smaller numbers of examples from theatre scripts and other fiction."

        "We can speculate on the reasons for this.",
        "It may be in part due to \"pollution\" of our corpus with non-Irish English, via syndicated journalism (e.g. some Irish newspapers are repackaging of British newspapers with added Irish content), or via multinational organisations with bases in Ireland.",
        "In our view the main explanatory factor is that of modality and register.",
        "The ICE-Ireland corpus is predominantly spoken (~60%), with many texts coming from informal settings (unscripted speeches, face to face and telephone conversations).",
        "One reading of the figures which is consistent with this viewpoint is that the .ie domain corpora contain proportionally more high register, edited text (e.g. from governmental and commercial organisations, for which the use of the .ie domain may be an important part of corporate identity), and that the tailored-seed corpora contain more text contributed by individuals (forums, blogs, etc), for whom domain endings are of little consequence.",
        "Nevertheless, the use of Hiberno-English specific seed terms did reveal higher incidences of distinctive Irish usages than simple domain filtering.",
        "But despite these lower incidences, in absolute terms our corpora provide many more examples of Hiberno-English than that were hitherto available.",
        "For example the ICE-Ireland corpus contains a total of seven examples of the \"after\" construction, while with our Irish-seeds derived corpus, and using a fairly restrictive query pattern, we isolated 26 examples of this structure.",
        "Further the size of these pilot corpora were kept intentionally limited, a small fraction of the approximately 150 million .ie domain pages indexed by Google.",
        "Much larger corpora could be constructed with relative ease, by using a larger seed set, or with an interactive seed-discovery method, where the text from the first round of web-harvesting could be analysed to identify further terms that are comparatively specific to Hiberno-English (relative to corpora of other varieties of English), in a similar fashion to the methods discussed in (Scannell, 2007).",
        "In terms of wider implications, the fact that seeds tailored to a particular region and language variant is as effective as filtering by domain, is encouraging for dialects and minority languages that lack a dedicated internet domain.",
        "This suggest that for less-dominant language variants without distinctive established orthographies (e.g. Scots, Andalusian, Bavarian), large corpora displaying characteristic features of that variant can be constructed in a simple automatic manner with minimal supervision (a small set of seeds provided by native speakers).",
        "Our methods might also prove useful for dialects in which a standard variant is dominant in the written language (e.g. Arabic, Chinese).",
        "One might expect that the written Arabic in the .ma (Morocco) domain would differ little from that in the .qa domain (Qatar) despite the large differences in vernacular speech.",
        "Similarly the grammar and vocabulary of Chinese written in Mainland Chinese, Taiwanese, Hong Kong and Singaporese domains (ignoring orthography) might be less representative of the variation in everyday language.",
        "The use of regional slang and proper names may help one to collect more examples of this more natural language usage, and less of the dominant standard variant."
