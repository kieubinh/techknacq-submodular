        "The contribution of this paper is a novel approach to feature induction seeking to model stylistic variation at a level that not only achieves high performance, but generalizes across domains better than alternative techniques.",
        "Building on an earlier template based approach for modeling sarcasm (Tsur et al., 2010), we investigate the use of what we have termed \"stretchy\" features to model stylistic variation related to sociolects, which can be thought of as a form of dialect.",
        "Specifically, we focus on the problem of gender based classification.",
        "Gender classification and age classification have both received increased attention in the social media analysis community in recent years (Goswami et al., 2009; Barbieri, 2008; Cieri et al., 2004), most likely because large data sets annotated with these variables have recently become available.",
        "Machine learning technology provides a lens with which to explore linguistic variation that complements earlier statistical techniques used by variationist sociolinguists in their work mapping out the space of dialect variation and its accompanying social interpretation (Labov, 2010a; Labov, 2010b; Eckert & Rickford, 2001).",
        "These complementary approaches share a common foundation in numerical methods, however while descriptive statistics and inferential statistics mainly serve the purpose of describing non-random differences in distributions between communities, machine learning work in the area of social media analysis asks the more challenging question of whether the differences described are big enough to enable identification of community membership by means of those differences.",
        "In the remainder of the paper, we first introduce prior work in a variety of related areas that both demonstrates why generalizable models characterizing sociolects within social media contexts are challenging to create and motivates our novel approach.",
        "Next we describe our technical approach for inducing \"stretchy patterns\".",
        "We then present a series of experiments that demonstrate that our stretchy patterns provide advantages over alternative feature spaces in terms of avoiding overfitting to irrelevant content-based features as evidenced both in terms of achieving higher performance with smaller amounts of training data and in terms of generalizing better across subpopulations that share other demographic and individual difference variables."

        "Analysis of social media has grown in popularity over the past decade.",
        "Nevertheless, results on problems such as gender classification (Argamon et al., 2003), age classification (Argamon et al., 2007), political affiliation classification (Jiang & Argamon, 2008), and sentiment analysis (Wiebe et al., 2004) demonstrate how difficult stylistic classification tasks can be, and even more so when the generality is evaluated by testing models trained in one domain on examples from another domain.",
        "Prior work on feature engineering has attempted to address this generalization difficulty.",
        "Here we motivate our \"stretchy pattern\" approach to feature engineering for modeling sociolects, using gender analysis as a lens through which to understand the problem.",
        "Since the earliest work in the area of variationist sociolinguistics, gender has been a variable of interest, which explains interesting differences in communication style that have been the topic of discussion both in academic circles (Holmes & Meyerhoff, 2003) and in the popular press (Tannen, 2001).",
        "The immense significance that has been placed on these differences, whether they are viewed as essentially linked to inherent traits, learned cultural patterns, or socially situated identities that are constructed within interaction, warrants attention to gender based differences within the scope of dialect variation.",
        "While one may view gender differences in communication from multiple angles, including topic, stance, and style, we focus specifically on linguistic style in our work.",
        "Numerous attempts to computationally model gender based language variation have been published in the past decade (Corney et al., 2002;",
        "Argamon et al., 2003; Schler et al., 2005; Schler, 2006; Yan & Yan, 2006; Zhang et al., 2009; Mukherjee & Liu, 2010).",
        "Gender based language variation arises from multiple sources.",
        "For example, within a single corpus comprised of samples of male and female language that the two genders do not speak or write about the same topics.",
        "This has been reported to be the case with blog corpora such as the one used in this paper.",
        "Even in cases where pains have been taken to control for the distribution of topics associated with each gender within a corpus (Argamon et al., 2003), it's still not clear the extent to which that distribution is completely controlled.",
        "For example, if one is careful to have equal numbers of writing samples related to politics from males and females, it may still be the case that males and females are discussing different political issues or are addressing political issues from a different role based angle.",
        "While these differences are interesting, they do not fit within the purview of linguistic style variation.",
        "Word based features such as unigrams and bigrams are highly likely to pick up on differences in topic (Schler, 2006) and possibly perspective.",
        "Thus, in cases where linguistic style variation is specifically of interest, these features are not likely to be included in the set of features used to model the variation even if their use leads to high performance within restricted domains.",
        "Typical kinds of features that are used instead include part-of-speech (POS) n-grams (Koppel, 2002; Argamon et al., 2003), word structure features that cluster words according to endings that indicate part of speech (Zhang et al., 2009), features that indicate the distribution of word lengths within a corpus (Corney et al., 2002), usage of punctuation, and features related to usage of jargon (Schler et al., 2005).",
        "In Internet-based communication, additional features have been investigated such as usage of internet specific features including \"internet speak\" (e.g., lol, wtf, etc.",
        "), emoticons, and URLs (Yan & Yan, 2006).",
        "In addition to attention to feature space design issues, some work on computational modeling of gender based language variation has included the development of novel feature selection techniques, which have also had a significant impact on success (Mukherjee & Liu, 2010; Zhang, Dang, & Chen, 2009).",
        "Of these features, the only ones that capture stylistic elements that extend beyond individual words at a time are the POS ngram features.",
        "The inclusion of these features has been motivated by their hypothesized generality, although in practice, the generality of gender prediction models has not been formally evaluated in the gender prediction literature.",
        "Recent work in the area of domain adaptation (Arnold et al., 2008; Daumé III, 2007; Finkel & Manning, 2009) raises awareness of the difficulties with generality of trained models and offers insight into the reasons for the difficulty with generalization.",
        "We consider these issues specifically in connection with the problem of modeling gender based variation.",
        "One problem, also noted by variationist sociolinguists, is that similar language variation is associated with different variables (McEnery, 2006) .",
        "For example, linguistic features associated with older age are also more associated with male communication style than female communication style for people of the same age (Argamon et al., 2007) .",
        "Another problem is that style is not exhibited by different words than those that serve the purpose of communicating content.",
        "Thus, there is much about style that is expressed in a topic specific way.",
        "What exacerbates these problems in text processing approaches is that texts are typically represented with features that are at the wrong level of granularity for what is being modeled.",
        "Specifically, for practical reasons, the most common types of features used in text classification tasks are still unigrams, bigrams, and part-of-speech bigrams.",
        "While relying heavily on these relatively simple features has computational advantages in terms of keeping the feature space size manageable, which aids in efficient model learning, in combination with the complicating factors just mentioned, these text classification approaches are highly prone to over-fitting.",
        "Specifically, when text is represented with features that operate at too fine grained of a level, features that truly model the target style are not present within the model.",
        "Thus, the trained models are not able to capture the style itself and instead capture features that merely correlate with that style within the data.",
        "Thus, in cases where the data is not independent and identically distributed (IID), and where instances that belong to different subpopulations within the non-IID data have different class value distributions, the model will tend to give weight to features that indicate the subpopulation rather than features that model the style.",
        "This may lead to models that perform well within datasets that contain the same distribution of subpopulations, but will not generalize to different subpopulations, or even datasets composed of different proportions of the same subpopulations.",
        "Models employing primarly unigrams and bigrams as features are particularly problematic in this respect.",
        "In recent years, a variety of manual and automatic feature engineering techniques have been developed in order to construct feature spaces that are adept at capturing interesting language variation without overfitting to content based variation, with the hope of leading to more generalizable models.",
        "POS n-grams, which have frequently been utilized in genre analysis models (Argamon et al., 2003), are a strategic balance between informativity and simplicity.",
        "They are able to estimate syntactic structure and style without modeling it directly.",
        "In an attempt to capture syntactic structure more faithfully, there has been experimentation within the area of sentiment analysis on using syntactic dependency features (Joshi & Rosé, 2009; Arora, Joshi, & Rosé, 2009).",
        "However, results have been mixed.",
        "In practice, the added richness of the features comes at a tremendous cost in terms of dramatic increases in feature space size.",
        "What has been more successful in practice is templatizing the dependency features in order to capture the same amount of structure without creating features that are so specific.",
        "Syntactic dependency based features are able to capture more structure than POS bigrams, however, they are still limited to representing relationships between pairs of words within a text.",
        "Thus, they still leave much to be desired in terms of representation power.",
        "Experimentation with graph mining from dependency parses has also been used for generating rich feature spaces (Arora et al., 2010).",
        "However, results with these features has also been disappointing.",
        "In practice, the rich features with real predictive power end up being difficult to find amidst myriads of useless features that simply add noise to the model.",
        "One direction that has proven successful at exceeding the representational power and performance of POS bigrams with only a very modest increase in feature space size has been a genetic programming based approach to learning to build a strategic set of rich features so that the benefits of rich features can be obtained without the expense in terms of feature space expansion.",
        "Successful experiments with this technique have been conducted in the area of sentiment analysis, with terminal symbols including unigrams in one case (Mayfield & Rosé, 2010) and graph features extracted from dependency parses in another (Arora et al., 2010).",
        "Nevertheless, improvements using these strategic sets of evolved features have been very small even where statistically significant, and thus it is difficult to justify adding so much machinery for such a small improvement.",
        "Another direction is to construct template based features that combine some aspects of POS n-grams in that they are a flat representation, and the backoff version of dependency features, in that the symbols represent sets of words, which may be POS tags, learned word classes, distribution based word classes (such as high frequency words or low frequency words), or words.",
        "Such types of features have been used alone or in combination with sophisticated feature selection techniques or bootstrapping techniques, and have been applied to problems such as detection of sarcasm (Tsur et al., 2010), detection of causal connections between events (Girju, 2010), or machine translation (Gimpel et al., 2011).",
        "Our work is most similar to this class of approaches."

        "For example, Gimpel (2011) uses Gibbs sampling to collect patterns containing single-word gaps, and uses them among other features in a machine translation system.",
        "Our patterns are more like the ones described in Tsur (2010), which were applied to the task of identifying sarcasm in sentences.",
        "We predicted that a similar method would show promise in extracting broader stylistic features indicative of the author's group-aligned dialect.",
        "We have chosen the classification of an author's gender as the task to which we can apply our patterns.",
        "To extract their sarcasm-detecting patterns, Tsur (2010) first defined two sets of words: High Frequency Words (HFW) and Content Words (CW).",
        "The HFW set contained all words that occurred more than 100 times per million, and the CW set contained all words in the corpus that occurred fewer than 1000 times per million.",
        "Thus, a word could be contained in the HFW set, the CW set, or both.",
        "Such patterns must begin and end with words in the HFW set, and (as in our implementation) are constrained in the number of words drawn from each set.",
        "Additionally, as a preprocessing step, in their approach they made an attempt to replace phrases belonging to several categories of domain-specific phrases, such as product and manufacturer names with a label string, which was then added to the HFW set, indicating membership.",
        "For example, given an input such as \"Garmin apparently does not care much about product quality or customer support\", a number of patterns would be produced, including \"[company] CW does not CW much\".",
        "Tsur's patterns were applied as features to classify sentences as sarcastic (or not), within the domain of online product reviews.",
        "Here our implementation and application diverge from Tsur's – the blog corpus features large multi-sentence documents, and span a diverse set of topics and authors.",
        "We aim to use these patterns not to classify sentiment or subtlety, but to capture the style and structure employed by subsets of the author-population.",
        "We define a document as an ordered list of tokens.",
        "Each token is composed of a surface-form lexeme and any additional syntactic or semantic information about the word at this position (in our case this is simply the POS tag, but other layers such as Named Entity might be included).",
        "We refer to any of the available forms of a token as a type.",
        "A category is a set of word-types.",
        "Each type must belong to at least one category.",

        "Gap is a special category, containing all types that aren't part of any other category.",
        "The types belonging to any defined category may also be explicitly added to the Gap category.",
        "A stretchy pattern is defined as a sequence of categories, which must not begin or end with a Gap category.",
        "We designate any number of adjacent Gap instances in a pattern by the string \"GAP+\"and every other category instance by its label.",
        "As a convention, the label of a singleton category is the name of the type contained in the category (thus \"writes\" would be the label of a category containing only surface form \"writes\" and \"VBZ\" would be the label of the a category containing only the POS tag \"VBZ\").",
        "The overall number of Gap and non-Gap category instances comprising a pattern is restricted - following Tsur (2010), we allow no more than six tokens of either category.",
        "In the case of Gap instances, this restriction is placed on the number of underlying tokens, and not the collapsed GAP+ form.",
        "A sequence of tokens in a document matches a pattern if there is some expansion where each token corresponds in order to the pattern's categories.",
        "A given instance of GAP+ will match between zero and six tokens, provided the total number of Gap instances in the pattern do not exceed six.",
        "By way of example, two patterns follow, with two strings that match each.",

        "\"and (some clients were) kindapopular..\" \"from (our) own general election...\"",
        "Although the matched sequences vary in length and content, the stretchy patterns preserve information about the proximity and ordering of particular words and categories.",
        "They focus on the relationship between key (non-Gap) words, and allow a wide array of sequences to be matched by",

        "Our \"stretchy pattern\" formalism strictly subsumes Tsur's approach in terms of representational power.",
        "In particular, we could generate the same patterns described in Tsur (2010) by creating a singleton surface form category for each word in Tsur's HFW and then creating a category called [CW] that contains all of the words in the Tsur CW set, in addition to the domain-specific product/manufacturer categories Tsur employed.",
        "With the aim of capturing general usage patterns, and motivated by the results of corpus linguists and discourse analysts, a handful token categories were defined, after the fashion of the LIWC categories as discussed in Gill (2009).",

        "Patterns are extracted from the training set, using a sliding window over the token stream to generate all allowable combinations of category-gap sequences within the window.",

        "Although we cannot draw broad conclusions from a qualitative investigation of such a small amount of data, we did observe some interesting trends.",
        "As our features do not so much capture syntactic structure as the loose proximity and order of classes of words, we'll say less about structure and more about what sort of words show up in each others' neighborhood.",
        "In particular, a huge proportion of the top-ranked patterns feature instances of the [end] and [frst-pron] categories, suggesting that much of the gender distinction captured by our patterns is to be found around sentence boundaries and self-references.",
        "It's believable and encouraging that \"the way I talk about myself is an important element in distinguishing style between genders.",
        "The Chi-squared ranking of the stretchy patterns gives us a hint as to the predictive effect of each as a feature.",
        "In the discussion and examples that follow, we'll draw from the highest-ranked features, and refer to the weights' signs to label each pattern as \"male\" or \"female\".",
        "In these features the discourse analyst or dialectician can find fodder for their favorite framework, or support for popularly held views on gender and language.",
        "For example, we find that about twice as many of the patterns containing either [third-pron] or [second-pron] in the neighborhood of [first-pron] are weighted toward female, supporting earlier findings that women are more concerned with considering interpersonal relationships in their discourse than are men, as in Kite (2002).",
        "For example, [first-pron] (GAP+) [third-pron] \"i (have time for) them\"",
        "Supporting the notion that distinctively female language is \"deviant,\" and viewed as a divergence from a male baseline, as discussed in Eckert & McConnell-Ginet (1992), we note that more of the top-ranked patterns are weighted toward female.",
        "This might suggest that the \"female\" style is less standard and therefore harder to detect.",
        "Additionally, we only find adjacent [end] markers, capturing repeated punctuation, in our female-weighted patterns.",
        "For instance,",
        "This divergence from the standard sentence form, while more common overall in informal electronic communications, does occur more frequently among female authors in the data.",
        "Further analysis of the data suggests that emoticons like :-) would have formed a useful category for our patterns, as they occur roughly twice as often in female posts, and often in the context of end-of-sentence punctuation.",

        "Samples of high-ranking stretchy patterns appear in Tables 4 and 5.",

        "While the results of our experiments have shown promising results, we acknowledge that we have scratched the surface of the problem we are investigating.",
        "First, our comparison was limited to just a couple of strategically selected baselines.",
        "However, there have been many variations in the literature on gender classification specifically, and genre analysis more generally, that we could have included in our evaluations, and that would likely offer additional insights.",
        "For example, we have tested our approach against POS bigrams, but we have not utilized longer POS sequences, which have been used in the literature on gender classification with mixed results.",
        "In practice, longer POS sequences have only been more valuable than POS bigrams when sophisticated feature selection techniques have been used (Mukherje & Liu, 2010).",
        "Attention may also be directed to the selection or generation of word categories better suited to stretchy patterns.",
