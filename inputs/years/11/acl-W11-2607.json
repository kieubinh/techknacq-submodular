        "Automatic recognition of non-native accented speech represents a complex problem, especially since this type of variability becomes more common even in languages with a relatively small number of speakers due to globalization and increased mobility of people.",
        "The methods most commonly used for dealing with this type of speech variability include pronunciation modeling, acoustic modeling, or topological modeling (Oh, Yoon and Kim, 2007, Tomokiyo, 2000).",
        "This paper presents an approach that starts with an analysis of the pronunciation variability of nonnative speech taking into account most salient differences between L1 language (in our case German) and L2 target language (Slovak).",
        "Following this knowledge-base step, a semiautomatic data-driven approach analyzes the pronunciation variants on a subset of a training corpus is proposed.",
        "The knowledge gained in this two-step process is then used to adapt our state-of-the-art ASR system for Slovak in an effort to improve the baseline recognition of this system in German accented Slovak.",
        "We primarily experiment with adapting the pronunciation dictionary and speech rate.",
        "In short, we test the acoustic model and lexicon adaptation based on the analysis of pronunciation proximity between the German-accented and standard varieties of Slovak.",

        "One of the most common ways of predicting differences between native (L1) and foreign-accented (L2) speech is to compare the sound systems of L1 and L2.",
        "Here we present a brief overview of most robust pronunciation differences between German and Slovak.",
        "In terms of segmental inventories, Slovak does not have front rounded vowels and has only one front mid vowel quality while German has two.",
        "Also, both languages have phonemically distinct short and long vowels, but the length distinction in German robustly affects vowel quality (short vowels being lax and more centralized), while this tendency for Slovak is much less salient and a mid central schwa is missing in the Slovak inventory (Benus and Mâdy 2010).",
        "Additionally, a major difference comes from Slovak palatal consonants (stops, nasal, and lateral) that are missing in German.",
        "Finally, /r/ is an apical trill in Slovak in all positions while it commonly has uvular or vocalized qualities in German.",
        "Many allophonic processes are different in the two languages.",
        "The most perceptually salient include the aspiration of voiceless stops and the glottalization of initial vowels in German and its absence in Slovak.",
        "German lacks a so called dark /l/ quality in syllable codas while most /l/s in Slovak have this quality.",
        "In terms of phonotactics, Slovak has a richer set of potential onset clusters than German.",
        "Additionally, Slovak syllabic nuclei might be formed by liquids (/l/, /r/) that also participate in lengthening alternations, which is not the case in German.",
        "While both languages have pervasive voicing assimilation and neutralization, voicing neutralization in obstruent coda consonants is slightly more salient in German than in Slovak.",
        "Finally, most salient prosodic differences include a fixed leftmost word stress in Slovak (cf. variable in German).",
        "Slovak in general also reduces the length and quality of unstressed vowels minimally, while in German, unstressed vowels tend to be shortened and centralized.",
        "In this section we test the theoretical predictions of pronunciation problems in Slovak with German accent stemming from interferences between L1 and L2 described in the previous section.",
        "We took a subset of our corpus, 100 accent sentences read by all 18 speakers and asked trained annotators to mark all perceptually salient markers of accented speech at the level of segments together with word stress differences.",
        "Different annotators (N=6) were given identical instructions and labeled different subsets of the data.",
        "A single expert then checked all annotations for mistakes and inconsistencies.",
        "speakerNum",
        "Figure 1.",
        "Error counts for all subjects divided by their L2 proficiency level (there were 2540 reference phonemes for each speaker)",
        "The annotators found 6966 segmental differences between 'standard' and German accented Slovak, which represents 15.2% of all 45720 phonemes in the 1800 accent sentences.",
        "Roughly half of the differences involved syllable nuclei including liquids (53.1%) and the rest involved onset and coda consonants.",
        "The assignment to proficiency levels showed a fairly reasonable correspondence with the number of segmental problems in the accent sentences, as can be seen in Figure 1 above.",
        "Given the discussion in Section 3.1, we noticed several expected and unexpected patterns in the distribution of pronunciation deviations.",
        "Table 1 below lists the most frequent groups of pronunciation problems.",
        "The expected problems involved differences in the palatalization of alveolar consonants (15.6%), and the presence of aspiration with voiceless plosives (3.3%).",
        "Two notable unexpected patterns were observed.",
        "First, despite some differences in the short and long syllabic nuclei, described in 3.1, the overall frequency of deviations in phonemic length was surprising: almost one third (31.6%) of all marked differences involved either the shortening of long nuclei or lengthening of short ones.",
        "Additionally, despite the clear and predictable placement of Slovak word stress, 13.7% of differences involved an incorrect placement of word stress.",
        "The production of German vowel quality (such as front rounded vowels or schwa) was relatively low (1.8%).",
        "Hence, prosodic and metrical features of vowels were perceived as far more problematic than the features related to their quality.",
        "The second unexpected pattern was a relatively high frequency of differences in the voicing of obstruent consonants (15.5%).",
        "The majority of these cases included the devoicing of consonants that, in regular fluent Slovak, would be produced as voiced.",
        "This pattern is related to pervasive coda voicing neutralization in German mentioned in section 3.1.",
        "Voicing of canonically voiceless consonants was observed as well, especially in the voicing of /s/ to /z/.",
        "It is worth noting that both of the unexpected patterns relate to speech rate.",
        "A generally slower rate of L2 speakers results in frequent pauses between words thus creating an environment that meets the description for obstruent devoicing in German and prevents across-the-word voice assimilation that is pervasive in Slovak.",
        "Additionally, the presence of these pauses facilitates so called pre-boundary lengthening (e.g. Delattre, 1968 for German), in which the rime of the pre-pausal syllable is elongated.",
        "Finally, a generally slower rate may result in vowels intended as short to be perceived as long especially in the speech that is slowed down locally (for example with unknown words for L2 speakers)."

        "Factor 0.9 lowered WER to 49.5% while factor 0.5 showed the worst result (54.1% WER).",
        "Following this encouraging initial result, feature level acceleration was performed by simple change of frame shift in the ASR front-end.",

        "Our results showed that adjusting the rate of non-native speech to resemble the rate of the native training corpus significantly improves the recognition of speech with foreign accent.",
        "Moreover, we showed that feature-based acceleration outperforms signal-based acceleration.",
        "This is important since feature-based acceleration is much easier to perform, and an ASR system runs faster as it processes less frames.",
        "Furthermore, it is plausible that speech rate variability will be similar in non-native accents of multiple L1 languages, which cannot be expected for the pronunciation variants.",
        "Hence, although the acceleration of the signal or features does not account for all of the phonetic interference phenomena described in Section 3.2, sophisticated speech rate modeling that includes the combination of phone rate, syllable rate, and word rate promises to provide a robust technique for dealing with variability stemming from non-native accents."
