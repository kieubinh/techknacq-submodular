        "WordNet.PT is being built since July 1999, at the Center of Linguistics of the University of Lisbon as a project developed by the Group for the Computation of Lexical and Grammatical Knowledge (CLG).",
        "WordNet.PT is being developed within the general approach of EuroWordNet (Vossen 1998, 1999).",
        "Therefore, like each wordnet in EWN, WordNet.PT has a general conceptual architecture structured along the lines of the Princeton WordNet (Miller et al.",
        "1990; Fellbaum 1998).",
        "For early strategic reasons concerning applications, this project is being carried out on the basis of manual work, assuring the accuracy and reliability of its results.",
        "Aiming at using the Portuguese WordNet in language learning applications, among others, the starting point for the specification of a fragment of the Portuguese lexicon, in the first phase of the project (1999-2003), consisted in the selection of a set of semantic domains covering concepts with high productivity in daily life communication.",
        "The encoding of language-internal relations followed a mixed top-down/bottom-up strategy for the extension of small local nets (Marrafa 2002).",
        "Such work firstly focused on nouns, but has since then been extended to all the main POS, a work which has resulted both in refining information specifications and increasing WordNet.PT coverage (Amaro et al.",
        "2006; Marrafa et al.",
        "2006;",
        "Amaro 2009; Mendes 2009).",
        "Relational lexica, and wordnets in particular, play a leading role in machine lexical knowledge representation.",
        "Hence, providing Portuguese with such a rich linguistic resource, and particularly Portuguese varieties not often considered in lexical resources, is crucial, not only to researchers working in contrastive studies or with the so-called non-standard varieties, but also to the general public, as the database is made available for consultation in the WWW through an intuitive and perspicuous web interface.",
        "Such work is also particularly relevant as the resulting database can be extensively used in a vast range of language-based applications, able to cover, this way, all Portuguese varieties.",
        "This paper depicts the work developed and the results achieved under the scope of the WordNet.PTglobal project, funded by Instituto Camöes, which, as mentioned above, aims at extending WordNet.PT to Portuguese varieties."

      "text": [
        "Portuguese is spoken in all five continents by over 250 million speakers, according to recent studies, and is the official language of 8 countries: Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, East Timor, Guinea Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, and Sao Tome e Principe.",
        "Being spoken in geographically distant regions and by very different communities, both in terms of size and culture, Portuguese is naturally expected to show variation.",
        "Despite this, regional varieties are far from being equally provided with linguistic resources representing their specificities, as most research work is focused either on the Brazilian or the European varieties.",
        "In the work depicted here we aim at contributing to reverse this situation, considering that this kind of resource is particularly adequate to achieve this goal, since it allows for representing lexical variation in a very straightforward way: concepts are the basic unit in wordnets, defined by a set of lexical conceptual relations with other concepts, and represented by the set of lexical expressions (tendentially all) that denote them.",
        "We have to antecipate the possibility of different varieties showing distinct lexicalization patterns, particularly some lexical gaps or lexicalizations of more specific concepts.",
        "This is straightforwardly dealt with in the WordNet model: once a system of relevant tags has been implemented in the database in order to identify lexical expressions with regard to their corresponding varieties, lexical gaps are simply encoded by not associating the tag of the variety at stake to any of the variants in the synset; specific lexicalizations, on the other hand, are added to the network as a new node and associated to the variety tag at stake.",
        "Our approach consisted in extracting 10 000 concepts from WordNet.PT, and associating them with the lexical expressions that denote them in each Portuguese variety considered in this project.",
        "In order to accomplish this, we consulted native speakers from each of these varieties, resident in their original communities, and asked them to",
        "European Portuguese.",
        "Moreover, these varieties are not provided with dedicated lexical resources, such as dictionaries or large-scale corpora.",
        "Being so, speakers in these regions generally use European Portuguese lexical resources, which only exceptionally cover lexical variants specific to these varieties.",
        "pinpoint the expressions used for denoting the aforementioned 10 000 concepts.",
        "Informants were selected by Instituto Camoes among undergrad students in Portuguese studies and supervised by Portuguese lectors in each local university.",
        "Besides the European Portuguese variety, which is already encoded in WordNet.PT, specifications for six other Portuguese varieties were integrated in the database : Angolan Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, Cape Verdean Portuguese, East Timorese Portuguese, Mozambican Portuguese and Sao Tome e Principe Portuguese.",
        "For each concept, several lexicalizations were identified and both the marked and unmarked expressions regarding usage information were considered and identified.",
        "As mentioned above, our approach for enriching WordNet.PT with lexicalizations from all Portuguese varieties consisted in extracting 10 000 concepts from WordNet.PT and associating them to the lexical expressions which denote them in each variety.",

        "Once the data described above were presented to the native speakers consulted and their input organized, all the information obtained was incorporated in the database.",
        "This way, for a concept like bus (public transportation which has regular pre-established stops at short intervals, typically operating within cities), for instance, the following lexicalizations were obtained: autocarro, machibombo, machimbombo, ônibus, and microônibus.",
        "Autocarro was found to be the more common expression used for denoting the concept at stake in Angola, Cape Verde, East Timor, Portugal, Sao Tome e Principe and Mozambique.",
        "However, this variant is marked as \"unusual\" in Mozambique variety.",
        "Machibombo and machimbombo are only used in Mozambique, whereas ônibus and microônibus are only used in Brazil.",
        "With this kind of data at hand, each lexicalization was tagged with regard to the varieties in which it is used and, for each variety, associated, when relevant, to a usage label, as illustrated below.",
        "In the codification of the aforementioned information we used Synsetter - a new, very flexible wordnet development tool previously developed for the full implementation of innovative research results in WordNet.PT.",
        "In order to do so, this computational tool has been developed to straightforwardly allow for updates and improvements.",
        "In the specific case of the task addressed in this paper, extending the coverage of the WordNet.PT database to lexicalizations of different Portuguese varieties involved the design of additional features regarding the identification of Portuguese varieties and variety-dependent usage label encoding.",
        "Encoding the data obtained in WordNet.PTglobalextends a relevant fragment of WordNet.PT to Portuguese varieties other than European Portuguese.",
        "This way, researchers are provided with a crucial database for developing contrastive studies on the lexicon of different Portuguese varieties or research on a specific Portuguese variety, just to mention a possible application.",
        "The table below presents the distribution of variants per variety in the fragment of the lexicon considered, making apparent, for instance, that in the collection of data considered in this project some varieties have more synonym forms for denoting the same concept than others (see average of variants per concept).",

        "This way, Portuguese now has a rich and useful lexical resource covering all of its varieties (Angolan, Brazilian, Cape Verdean, East Timorese, European, Mozambican, Sao Tome e Principe and Guinean Portuguese (forthcoming see footnote 1)), freely available for online consultation both to researchers and to the general public.",
