        "Reversible stochastic attribute-value grammars (de Kok et al., 2011) provide an elegant framework that fully integrates parsing and generation.",
        "The most important contribution of this framework is that it uses one conditional maximum entropy model for fluency ranking and parse disambiguation.",
        "In such a model, the probability of a derivation d is conditioned on a set of input constraints c that restrict the set of derivations allowed by a grammar to those corresponding to a particular sentence (parsing) or logical form (generation):",
        "Here, Q(c) is the set of derivations for input c, ft(c, d) the value of feature ft in derivation d of c, and Wi is the weight of fi.",
        "Reversibility is opera-tionalized during training by imposing a constraint on a given feature fi with respect to the sentences T in the parse disambiguation treebank and logical forms L in the fluency ranking treebank.",
        "This constraint is:",
        "Where C = T U L, p(c) is the empirical probability of a set of constraints c, and p(c, d) the joint probability of a set of constraints c and a derivation d.",
        "Reversible stochastic-attribute grammars rest on the premise that preferences are shared between language comprehension and production.",
        "For instance, in Dutch, subject fronting is preferred over direct object fronting.",
        "If models for parse disambiguation and fluency ranking do not share preferences with respect to fronting, it would be difficult for a parser to recover the logical form that was the input to a generator.",
        "Reversible models incorporate features that are specific to parse disambiguation and fluency ranking, as well as features that are used for both tasks.",
        "Previous work (Cahill et al., 2007; de Kok, 2010) has shown through feature analysis that task-independent features are indeed useful in directional models.",
        "However, since reversible models assign just one weight to each feature regardless the task, one particular concern is that much of their discriminatory power is provided by task-specific features.",
        "If this is true, the premise that similar preferences are used in parsing and generation does not hold.",
        "In this work, we will isolate the most discriminative features of reversible models through feature selection, and make a quantitative and qualitative analysis of these features.",
        "Our aim is to to verify that reversible models do rely on features used both in parsing and generation.",
        "To find the most effective features of a model, we need an effective feature selection method.",
        "Section 2 describes three such methods: grafting, grafting-light, and gain-informed selection.",
        "These methods are compared empirically in Section 4 using the experimental setup described in Section 3.",

        "As discussed in De Kok (2010), a good feature selection method should handle three kinds of redundancies in feature sets: features that rarely change value; features that overlap; and noisy features.",
        "Also, for a qualitative evaluation of fluency ranking, it is necessary to have a ranking of features by discriminative power.",
        "De Kok (2010) compares frequency-based selection, correlation selection, and a gain-informed selection method.",
        "In that work, it was found that the gain-informed selection method outperforms frequency-based and correlation selection.",
        "For this reason we exclude the latter two methods from our experiments.",
        "Other commonly used selection methods for maximum entropy models include l1 regularization (Tibshirani, 1996), grafting (Perkins etal., 2003; Riezler and Vasserman, 2004), and graftinglight (Zhu et al., 2010).",
        "In the following sections, we will give a description of these selection methods.",
        "During the training of maximum entropy models, regularization is often applied to avoid unconstrained feature weights and overfitting.",
        "If L(w) is the objective function that is minimized during training, a regularizer Qq(w) is added as a penalty for extreme weights (Tibshirani, 1996):",
        "Given that the maximum entropy training procedure attempts to minimize the negative log-likelihood of the model, the penalized objective function is:",
        "The regularizer has the following form:",
        "Setting q = l in the regularizer function gives a so-called l1 regularizer and amounts to applying a double-exponential prior distribution with ß = 0.",
        "Since the double-exponential puts much of its probability mass near its mean, the l1 regularizer has a tendency to force weights towards zero, providing integral feature selection and avoiding unbounded weights.",
        "Increasing A strengthens the regularizer, and forces more feature weights to be zero.",
        "Given an appropriate value for A, l1 regularization can exclude features that change value infrequently, as well as noisy features.",
        "However, it does not guarantee to exclude overlapping features, since the weight mass can be distributed among overlapping features.",
        "l1 regularization also does not fulfill a necessary characteristic for the present task, in that it does not provide a ranking based on the discriminative power of features.",
        "Grafting (Perkins et al., 2003) adds incremental feature selection during the training of a maximum entropy model.",
        "The selection process is a repetition of two steps: 1. a gradient-based heuristic selects the most promising feature from the set of unselected features Z, adding it to the set of selected features S, and 2. a full optimization of weights is performed over all features in S. These steps are repeated until a stopping condition is triggered.",
        "During the first step, the gradient of each unselected feature fi G Z is calculated with respect to the model ps, that was trained with the set of selected features, S:",
        "= Ps(fi) - v(fi.",
        "The feature with the largest gradient is removed from Z and added to S.",
        "The stopping condition for grafting integrates the l1 regularizer in the grafting method.",
        "Note that when l1 regularization is applied, a feature is only included (has a non-zero weight) if its penalty is out-weighted by its contribution to the reduction of the objective function.",
        "Consequently, only features for > A holds are eligible for selection.",
        "This is enforced by stopping selection if for all fi in",
        "Although grafting uses l1 regularization, its iterative nature avoids selecting overlapping features.",
        "For instance, if f1 and f2 are identical, and f1 is added to the model Ps, will amount to zero.",
        "Performing a full optimization after each selected feature is computationally expensive.",
        "Riezler and Vasserman (2004) observe that during the feature step selection a larger number of features can be added to the model (n-best selection) without a loss of accuracy in the resulting model.",
        "However, this so-called n-best grafting may introduce overlapping features.",
        "The grafting-light method (Zhu et al., 2010) operates using the same selection step as grafting, but improves performance over grafting by applying one iteration of gradient-descent during the optimization step rather than performing a full gradient-descent.",
        "As such, grafting-light gradually works towards the optimal weights, while grafting always finds the optimal weights for the features in S during each iteration.",
        "Since grafting-light does not perform a full gradient-descent, an additional stopping condition is required, since the model may still not be optimal even though no more features can be selected.",
        "This additional condition requires that change in value of the objective function incurred by the last gradientdescent is smaller than a predefined threshold.",
        "Gain-informed feature selection methods calculate the gain AL(S, fi) of adding a feature fi G Z to the model.",
        "If L(ws) is the negative log-likelihood of ps, AL(S, fi) is defined as:",
        "During each selection step, the feature that gives the highest gain is selected.",
        "The calculation of L(psu/i) requires a full optimization over the weights of the features in S U fi.",
        "Since it is computationally intractable to do this for every fi in Z, Berger et al.",
        "(1996) propose to estimate the weight wi of the candidate feature fi, while assuming that the weights of features in S stay constant.",
        "Under this assumption, wi can be estimated using a simple line search method.",
        "However, Zhou et al.",
        "(2003) observe that, despite this simplification, the gain-informed selection method proposed by Berger et al.",
        "(1996) still recalculates the weights of all the candidate features during every cycle.",
        "They observe that the gains of candidate features rarely increase.",
        "If it is assumed that the gain of adding a feature does indeed never increase as a result of adding another feature, the gains of features during the previous iteration can be kept.",
        "To account for features that become ineffective, the gain of the highest ranked feature is recalculated.",
        "The highest ranked feature is selected if it remains the best feature after this recalculation.",
        "Otherwise, the same procedure is repeated for the next best feature.",
        "De Kok (2010) modifies the method of Zhou et al.",
        "(2003) for ranking tasks.",
        "In the present work, we also apply this method, but perform a full optimization of feature weights in Ps every n cycles.",
        "Since this selection method uses the gain of a feature in its selection criterion, it excludes noisy and redundant features.",
        "Overlapping features are also excluded since their gain diminishes after selecting one of the overlapping features."

        "In fact, the opposite is true: in the reversible model task-independent features become more defining than in the directional models.",
