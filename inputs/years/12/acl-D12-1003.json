        "As a solution, a number of previous works proposed extracting bilingual lexicons from comparable corpora, in which documents were not direct translations but shared a topic or domain1.",
        "The use of comparable corpora is motivated by the fact that large parallel corpora are only available for a few language pairs and for limited domains.",
        "Most of the previous methods are based on assumption (I), that a word and its translation tend to appear in similar contexts across languages (Rapp, 1999).",
