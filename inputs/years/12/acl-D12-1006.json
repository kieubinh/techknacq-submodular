        "Most online communities involve a mixture of positive and negative relations between users.",
        "Positive relations may indicate friendship, agreement, or approval.",
        "Negative relations usually indicate antagonism, opposition, or disagreement.",
        "Most of the research on relations in social media applications has almost exclusively focused on positive links between individuals (e.g. friends, fans, followers, etc.).",
        "We think that one of the main reasons, of why the interplay of positive and negative links did not receive enough attention, is the lack of a notion for explicitly expressing negative interactions.",
        "Recently, this problem has received increasing attention.",
        "However, all studies have been limited to a handful of datasets from applications that allow users to explicitly label relations as either positive or negative (e.g. trust/distrust on Epinion (Leskovec et al., 2010b) and friends/foes on Slashdot (Kunegis et al., 2009)).",
        "Predicting positive/negative relations between discussants is related to another well studied problem, namely debate stance recognition.",
        "The objective of this problem is to identify which participants are supporting and which are opposing the topic being discussed.",
        "This line of work does not pay enough attention to the relations between participants, rather it focuses on participant's stance toward the topic.",
        "It also assumes that every participant either supports or opposes the topic being discussed.",
        "This is a simplistic view that ignore the nature of complex topics that has many aspects involved which may result in more than two subgroups with different opinions.",
        "In this work, we apply Natural Language Processing techniques to text correspondences exchanged between individuals to identify the underlying signed social structure in online communities.",
        "We present a method for identifying user attitude and for automatically constructing a signed social network representation of discussions.",
        "We apply the proposed methods to a large set of discussion posts.",
        "We evaluate the performance using a manually labeled dataset.",
        "We also conduct a large scale evaluation by showing that predicted links are consistent with the principals of social psychology theories, namely the Structural Balance Theory (Heider, 1946).",
        "The balance theory has been shown to hold both theoretically (Heider, 1946) and empirically (Leskovec et al2010c) for a variety of social community settings.",
        "Finally, we present a method for identifying subgroups in online discussions by identifying groups with high density of intra-group positive relations and high density of intergroup negative relations.",
        "This method is capable of identifying subgroups even if the community splits into more than two subgroups which is more general than stance recognition which assumes that only two groups exist.",
        "along with evidence from text that justifies edge signs.",
        "The input to our algorithm is a set of text correspondences exchanged between users (e.g. posts or comments).",
        "The output is a signed network where edges signify the existence of an interaction between two users.",
        "The resulting network has polarity associated with every edge.",

        "We notice that participants split into two groups, one supporting and one opposing the leak.",
        "We also notice that most negative edges are between groups, and most positive edges are within groups.",
        "It is worth mentioning that networks generated from larger datasets (i.e. with thousands of posts) have much more noise compared to this example.",
