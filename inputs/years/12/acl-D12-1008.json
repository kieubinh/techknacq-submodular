        "Recent work on incremental systems has shown that adapting a system's turn-taking behaviour to be more human-like can improve the user's experience significantly, based on incremental models of automatic speech recognition (ASR) (Baumann et al. 2011), dialogue management (Buss et al2010), and speech generation (Skantze and Hjalmarsson, 2010).",
        "All of these approaches are based on the same general abstract architecture of incremental processing (Schlangen and Skantze, 2011).",
        "While this architecture offers inherently incremental mechanisms to update and revise input hypotheses, it is affected by a number of drawbacks, shared by deterministic models of decision making in general: they rely on hand-crafted rules which can be time-consuming and expensive to produce, they do not provide a mechanism to deal with uncertainty introduced by varying user behaviour, they are unable to generalise and adapt flexibly to unseen situations, and they do not use automatic optimisation.",
        "Statistical approaches to incremental processing that address some of these problems have been suggested by Raux and Eskenazi (2009), who use a cost matrix and decision theoretic principles to optimise turn-taking in a dialogue system under the constraint that users prefer no gaps and no overlap at turn boundaries.",
        "Also, DeVault et al2009) use maximum entropy classification to support responsive overlap in an incremental system by predicting the completions of user utterances.",
        "Selfridge et al2011) use logistic regression models to predict the stability and accuracy of incremental speech recognition results to enhance performance without causing delay.",
        "For related work on (deterministic) incremental language generation, please see (Kilger and Finkler, 1995; Purver and Otsuka, 2003).",
        "Recent years have seen a number of data-driven approaches to interactive systems that automatically adapt their decisions to the dialogue context us",
        "2011; Dethlefs and Cuaya?huitl, 2011).",
        "While these approaches have been shown to enhance the performance and adaptivity of interactive systems, unfortunately none of them has yet been combined with incremental processing.",
        "In this paper, we present a novel approach to incremental decision making for output planning that is based on Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL).",
        "In particular, we address the problem of optimising IP strategies while allowing the system to generate and comprehend backchannels and barge-ins based on a partially data-driven reward function.",
        "Generating backchannels can be beneficial for grounding in interaction.",
        "Similarly, barge-ins can lead to more efficient interactions, e.g. when a system can clarify a bad recognition result immediately before acting based on a misrecognition.",
        "A central concept to our approach is Information Density (ID) (Jaeger, 2010), a psycholinguistic hypothesis that human utterance production is sensitive to a uniform distribution of information across the utterance.",
        "This hypothesis has also been adopted for low level output planning recently, see e.g. Rajku-mar and White (2011).",
        "Our results in terms of average rewards and a human rating study show that a learning agent that is sensitive to ID can learn when it is most beneficial to generate feedback to a user, and outperforms several other agents that are not sensitive to ID."
