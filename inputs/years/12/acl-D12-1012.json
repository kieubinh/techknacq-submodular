        "Our technique compares reasonably with the manually constructed generic extractor for two of the three entity types; and on precision for all entity types, especially since our system generated the rules in 1 hour, whereas the development of manual rules took much longer 7.",
        "Additional work is required to match the manual customized extractor's performance, primarily due to shortcomings in our current target language.",
        "Recall that our framework is limited to a small subset of AQL constructs for expressing CD and CR rules, and there is a single consolidation rule.",
        "In particular, advanced constructs such as dynamic dictionaries are not supported, and the set of predicates to the Filter construct supported in our system is restricted to predicates over other concepts, which is only a subset of those used in (Chiticariu et al2010b).",
        "The manual extractors also contain a larger number of rules covering many different cases, improving the accuracy, but also leading to a higher complexity score.",
        "To better analyze the complexity, we also computed the average rule length for each extractor by dividing the complexity score by the number of AQL views of the extractor.",
        "The average rule length is 1.78 and 1.87 for the induced extractors with E2 and E3, respectively, and 1.9 and 2.1 for the generic and customized extractors of (Chiticariu et al., 2010b), respectively.",
        "The average rule length increases from the generic extractor to the customized extractor in both cases.",
        "On average, however, an individual induced rule is slightly smaller than a manually developed rule.",
        "Effect of Bias.",
        "The goal of this experiment is to demonstrate the importance of biases in the induction process.",
        "The biases added to the system are broadly of two types: (i) Partition of basic features based on types (ii) Restriction on the type of CD views that can appear in a CR view.",
        "8 Without 7 (Chiticariu et al2010b) mentions that customization for 3 domains required 8 person weeks.",
        "It is reasonable to infer that developing the generic rules took comparable effort.",
        "(i) many semantically similar basic features (especially, regular expressions) would match a given token, leading to an increase in the length of a CD a rule.",

        "CapsOrg]} (?A FirstNameDict span followed by a CapsPerson span that is also a Cap-sOrg span?",
        "), CapsPerson and CapsOrg are two very similar regular expressions identifying capitalized phrases that look like person, and respectively, organization names, with small variations (e.g., the former may allow special characters such as ?-?).",
        "Including both BFs in a CD rule leads to a larger rule that is unintuitive for a developer.",
        "The former bias excludes such CD rules from consideration.",
        "The latter type of bias prevents CD rules of one type to appear as positive clues for a CR rule of a different type.",

        "CitiesDict]}.",
        "The inclusion of an Organization CD rule as a positive clue for a Person CR rule is unintuitive for a developer.",
        "Table 4, shows the effect (for E2 and E3) on the test dataset of disabling and enabling bias during the induction of CR rules using JRIP.",
        "Adding bias improves the precision of the induced rules.",
        "Without bias, however, the system is less constrained in its search for high recall rules, leading to slightly higher overall F measure.",
        "This comes at the cost of an increase in extractor complexity and average rule length.",
        "For example, for E2, the average rule length decreases from 2.17 to 1.78 after adding the bias.",
        "Overall, our results show that biases lead to less complex extractors with only a very minor effect on accuracy, thus biases are important factors contributing to inducing rules that are understandable and may be refined by humans.",
        "Comparison with other induction systems.",
        "We also experimented with two other induction systems, Aleph9 and ALP10, a package that implements one of the reportedly good information extraction algorithms (Ciravegna, 2001).",
        "While induction in Aleph",
        "was performed with the same target language as in our approach, the target language of ALP is JAPE, which has been shown (Chiticariu et al2010b) to lack in some of the constructs (such as minus) that AQL provides and which form a part of our target language (especially the rule refinement phase).",
        "However, despite experimenting with all possible parameter configurations for each of these (in each of E1, E2 and E3 settings), the accuracies obtained were substantially (30-50%) worse and the extractor complexity was much (around 60%) higher when compared to our system (with or without bias).",
        "Additionally, Aleph takes close to three days for induction, whereas both ALP and our system require less than an hour."

        "Weak and Strong CDs reflected in CRs.",
        "In our experiments, we found that varying the precision and complexity thresholds while inducing the CDs (c.f Section 5) affected the F1 of the final extractor only minimally.",
        "But reducing the precision threshold generally improved the precision of the final extractor, which seemed counter-intuitive at first.",
        "We found that CR rules learned by JRIP consist of a strong CD rule (high precision, typically involving a dictionary) and a weak CD rule (low precision, typically involving only regular expressions).",
        "The strong CD rule always corresponded to a positive clue (match) and the weak CD rule corresponded to the negative clue (overlaps or not-matches).",
        "This is illustrated in the following CR rule: PER ?",

        "it tries to learn conjunctions of weak and strong clues so as to filter one from the other.",

        "In this work, we have taken a first step towards measuring interpretability using a coarse grain measure in the form of a simple notion of complexity score.",
        "The complexity is very helpful in comparing alternative rule sets based on",
        "the number of rules, and the size of each rule, but exhibits a number of shortcomings described next.",
        "First, it disregards other components of a rule besides its from clause, for example, the number of items in the select clause, or the where clause.",
        "Second, rule developers use semantically meaningful view names such as those shown in Figure 1 to help them recall the semantics of a rule at a high-level, an aspect that is not captured by the complexity measure.",
        "Automatic generation of meaningful names for induced views is an interesting direction for future work.",
        "Finally, the overall structure of an extractors is not considered.",
        "In simple terms, an extractor consisting of 5 rules of size 1 is indistinguishable from an extractor consisting of a single rule of size 5, and it is arguable which of these extractors is more interpretable.",
        "More generally, the extent of this shortcoming is best explained using an example.",
        "When informally examining the rules induced by our system, we found that CD rules are similar in spirit to those written by rule developers.",
        "On the other hand, the induced CR rules are too fine-grained.",
        "In general, rule developers group CD rules with similar semantics, then write refinement rules at the higher level of the group, as opposed to the lower level of individual CD views.",
        "For example, one may write multiple CD rules for candidate person names of the form ?First?",
        "?Last?, and multiple CD rules of the form ?Last?, ?First?.",
        "One would then union together the candidates from each of the two groups into two different views, e.g., Per-FirstLast and PerLastCommaFirst, and write filter rules at the higher level of these two views, e.g., ?Remove PerLastCommaFirst spans that overlap with a PerFirstLast span?.",
        "In contrast, our induction algorithm considers CR rules consisting of combinations of CD rules directly, leading to many semantically similar CR rules, each operating over small parts of a larger semantic group (see rule in Section 6.1).",
        "This results in repetition, and qualitatively less interpretable rules, since humans prefer higher levels of abstraction and generalization.",
        "This nuance is not captured by the complexity score which may deem an extractor consisting of many rules, where many of the rules operate at higher levels of groups of candidates to be more complex than a smaller extractor with many fine-grained rules.",
        "Indeed, as shown before, the complexity of the induced extractors is much smaller compared to that of manual extractors, although the latter follow the semantic grouping principle and are considered more interpretable."
