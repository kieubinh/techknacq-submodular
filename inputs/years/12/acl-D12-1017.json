        "The approaches building on this work (Farkas et al., 2007; Nicolae et al2007, among others) are supervised, mostly using shallow surface features as well as grammatical relations.1 Most effective in the SemEval task as summarized in Markert and Nissim (2009) has been the local, grammatical context, with the two systems relying on the global context or the local/global context in a BOW model (Leveling, 2007; Poibeau, 2007) not outperforming the most frequent reading baseline.",

        "Utiyama et al2000), Lapata (2003) propose a probabilistic model for finding the correct interpretation of such metonymies in an unsupervised manner.",
        "However, these event type metonymies differ from the problem dealt with in our paper and the SemEval 2007 task in that their recognition (i.e. their distinction from literal occurrences) is achieved simply by grammatical patterns (a noun instead of a gerund or to-infinitive following the verb) and the problem is limited to interpretation.",
        "Our view of relations in a concept network being the interpretations of metonymies is strongly reminiscent of older work in metonymy resolution such as Hobbs et al1993), Fass (1991), Markert and Hahn (2002) or the use of a generative lexicon and its relations in Pustejovsky (1991), which also are unsupervised.",
        "However, these approaches lacked scalability due to the use of small hand-modeled knowledge bases which our use of a very large Wikipedia-derived ontology overcomes.",
        "In addition, most of these approaches (Fass, 1991; Hobbs et al. 1993; Pustejovsky, 1991; Harabagiu, 1998) rely on the view that metonymies violate selectional restrictions in their immediate, local context, usually those 1Brun et al2007) is semi-supervised but again relies on the local grammatical context.",
        "imposed by the verbs on their arguments.",
        "As can be seen in the Example 2, this misses metonymies which do not violate selectional restrictions.",
        "Nastase and Strube (2009) use more flexible probabilistic selectional preferences instead of strict constraint violations as well as WordNet as a larger taxonomy but are also restricted to the local context.",
        "Markert and Hahn (2002) do propose a treatment of metonymies that takes into account the larger discourse in the form of anaphoric relations between a metonymy and the prior context.",
        "However, they constrain discourse integration to potential PMWs that are definite NPs and the context to few previous noun phrases.",
