        "This paper explores document-level SMT from the tense perspective.",
        "In particular, we focus on how to build document-level and sentence-level tense models and how to integrate such models into a popular SMT system.",
        "Compared with the inter-tense model which greatly improves the performance of SMT, the intra-tense model needs to be further explored.",
        "The reasons are many folds, e.g. the failure to exclude quoted texts when modeling intra-tense, since tenses in quoted texts behave much diversely from normal texts.",
        "In the future work, we will focus on modeling intra-tense variation according to specific sentence types and using more features to improve it."
