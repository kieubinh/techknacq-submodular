        "Question Answering (QA) research for factoid questions has recently achieved great success as demonstrated by IBM's Watson at Jeopardy: its accuracy has been reported to be around 85% on factoid questions (Ferrucci et al2010).",
        "Although recent shared QA tasks (Voorhees, 2004; Pe?as et al2011; Fuku-moto et al2007) have stimulated the research community to move beyond factoid QA, comparatively little attention has been paid to QA for non-factoid questions such as why questions and how to questions, and the performance of the state-of-art non-factoid QA systems reported in the literature (Mu-rata et al2007; Surdeanu et al2011; Verberne et al., 2010) remains considerably lower than that of factoid QA (i.e., 34% in MRR at top-150 results on why-questions (Verberne et al2010)).",
        "In this paper we explore the utility of sentiment analysis (Pang et al2002; Turney, 2002; Nakagawa et al2010) and semantic word classes for improving why-question answering (why-QA) on a large-scale web corpus.",
        "The inspiration behind this work is the observation that why-questions and their answers often have the following tendency: ?",
        "if something undesirable happens, the reason is often also something undesirable, and ?",
        "if something desirable happens, its reason is often also desirable.",
        "Consider the following question Q1, and its answer candidates A1-1 and A1-2.",
        "?",
        "Q1: Why does cancer occur?",
        "?",
        "A1-1: Carcinogens such as nitrosamine and benzopyrene may increase the risk of cancer by altering DNA in cells.",
        "?",
        "A1-2: Maintaining a healthy weight may lower",
        "the risk of various types of cancer.",
        "Here A1-1 describes an undesirable event related to cancer, while A1-2 suggests a desirable action for its prevention.",
        "Our hypothesis suggests that A1-1 is more appropriate for answering Q1.",
        "If this hypothesis holds, we can obtain a significant improvement in performance on why-QA tasks by exploiting the sentiment orientation1 of expressions obtainable 1 In this paper we denote the desirable/undesirable polarity of an expression by the term ?sentiment orientation?",
        "instead of ?semantic orientation?",
        "to avoid confusion with our different notion of ?semantic word classes.",
        "?",
        "by automatic sentiment analysis of questions and answers.",
        "A second observation motivating this work is that there are often significant associations between the lexico-semantic classes of words in a question and those in its answer sentence.",
        "For instance, questions concerning diseases like Q1 often have answers that include references to specific semantic word classes such as chemicals (like A1-1), viruses, body parts, and so on.",
        "Capturing such statistical correlations between diseases and harmful substances may lead to higher why-QA performance.",
        "For this purpose we use classes of semantically similar words that were automatically acquired from a large web corpus using an EM-based clustering method (Kazama and Torisawa, 2008).",
        "Another issue is that simply introducing the sentiment orientation of words or phrases in question and answer sentences in a naive way is insufficient, since answer candidate sentences may contain multiple sentiment expressions with different polarities in answer candidates (i.e., about 33% of correct answers had such multiple sentiment expressions with different polarities in our test set).",
        "For example, if A1-2 contained a second sentiment expression with negative polarity like the example below, ?Trusting a specific food is not effective for preventing cancer, but maintaining a healthy weight may help lower the risk of various types of cancer.?",
        "both A1-1 and A1-2 would contain sentiment expressions with the same polarity as that of Q1.",
        "Thus, it is difficult to expect that the sentiment orientation alone will work well for recognizing A1-1 as a correct answer to Q1.",
        "To address this problem, we consider the combination of sentiment polarity and the contents of sentiment expressions associated with the polarity in questions and their answer candidates as well.",
        "To deal with the data sparseness problem arising in using the content of sentiment expressions, we developed a feature set that combines the polarity and the semantic word classes effectively.",
        "We exploit these two main ideas (concerned with the sentiment orientation and the semantic classes described so far) for training a supervised classifier to rank answer candidates to why-questions.",
        "Through a series of experiments on 850 Japanese why-questions, we showed that the proposed semantic features were effective in identifying correct answers, and our proposed method obtained more than 15% improvement in precision of its top answer (P@1) over our baseline, which achieved the best performance in the non-factoid QA task in NTCIR6 (Murata et al2007).",
        "We also show that our method can potentially perform with high precision (64.8% in P@1) when answer candidates containing at least one correct answer are given to our re-ranker."
