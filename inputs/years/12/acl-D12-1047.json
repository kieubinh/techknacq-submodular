        "Language model (LM) plays a critical role in statistical machine translation (SMT).",
        "It seems to be a universal truth that LM performance can always be improved by using more training data (Brants et al., 2007), but only if the training data is reasonably well-matched with the desired output (Moore and Lewis, 2010).",
        "It is also obvious that among the large training data the topics or domains of discussion will change (Eck et al2004), which causes the mismatch problems with the translation task.",
        "For this reason, most researchers preferred to select similar training data from the large training corpus in the past few years (Eck et al2004; Zhao et al2004; Kim, 2005; Masskey and Sethy, 2010; Axelrod et al., 2011).",
        "This would empirically provide more accurate lexical probabilities, and thus better match the translation task at hand (Axelrod et al2011).",
        "Many previous data selection approaches for LM adaptation in SMT depend on the first pass translation hypotheses (Eck et al2004; Zhao et al2004; Kim, 2005; Masskey and Sethy, 2010), they select the sentences which are similar to the translation hypotheses.",
        "These schemes are overall limited by the quality of the translation hypotheses (Tam et al. 2007 and 2008), and better initial translation hypotheses lead to better selected sentences (Zhao et al., 2004).",
        "However, while SMT has achieved a great deal of development in recent years, the translation hypotheses are still far from perfect (Wei and Pal, 2010), which have many noisy data.",
        "The noisy translation hypotheses mislead data selection process (Xu et al2001; Tam et al2006 and 2007; Wei and Pal, 2010), and thus take noisy data into the selected training data, which causes noisy proliferation and degrades the performance of adapted LM.",
        "Furthermore, traditional approaches for LM adaptation are based on bag-of-words models and considered to be context independent, despite of their state-of-the-art performance, such as TF-IDF (Eck et al., 2004; Zhao et al2004; Hildebrand et al2005; Kim, 2005; Foster and Kuhn, 2007), centroid similarity (Masskey and Sethy, 2010), and cross-lingual similarity (CLS) (Ananthakrishnan et al2011a).",
        "They all perform at the word level, exact only ter",
        "m matching schemes, and do not take into account any contextual information when modeling the selection by single words in isolation, which degrade the quality of selected sentences.",
        "In this paper, we argue that it is beneficial to model the data selection based on the source translation task directly and capture the contextual information for LM adaptation.",
        "To this end, we propose a more principled translation model (TM) based cross-lingual data selection model for LM adaptation, from word models to phrase models.",
        "We assume that the data selection should be performed by the cross-lingual model and at the phrase level.",
        "Given a source sentence in the translation task, this model directly estimates the probability before translation that a sentence in the target LM training corpus is similar.",
        "Therefore, it does not require the translation task to be pre-translation as in monolingual adaptation, and can address the problem of noisy proliferation.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first extensive and empirical study of using phrase TM based cross-lingual data selection for LM adaptation.",
        "This model learns the transform probability of a multi-term phrase in a source sentence given a phrase in the target sentence of LM training corpus.",
        "Compared with bag-of-words models and word-based TM that account for selecting single words in isolation, this model performs at the phrase level and captures some contextual information in modeling the selection of phrase as a whole, thus it is potentially more effective.",
        "More precise data selection can be determined for phrases than for words.",
        "In this model, we propose a linear ranking model framework to further improve the performance, referred to the linear discriminant function (Duda et al., 2001; Collins, 2002; Gao et al2005) in pattern classification and information retrieval (IR), where different models are incorporated as features, as we will show in our experiments.",
        "Unlike the general TM in SMT, we explore the use of TextRank algorithm (Mihalcea et al2004) to identify and eliminate unimportant words (e.g., non-topical words, common words) for corpus preprocessing, and construct TM by important words.",
        "This reduces the average number of words in cross-lingual data selection model, thus improving the efficiency.",
        "Moreover, TextRank utilizes the context information of words to assign term weights (Lee et al2008), which makes phrase TM based cross-lingual data selection model play its advantage of capturing the contextual information, thus further improving the performance.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 introduces the related work of LM adaptation.",
        "Section 3 presents the framework of cross-lingual data selection for LM adaptation.",
        "Section 4 describes our proposed TM based cross-lingual data selection model: from word models to phrase models.",

        "Furthermore, phrase TM based cross-lingual data selection is more effective than the traditional approaches based on bag-of-words models and word-based TM, because it captures contextual information in modeling the selection of phrase as a whole.",
        "Large-scale experiments are conducted on LM perplexity and SMT performance, and the results demonstrate that our approach solves the two aforementioned disadvantages and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for LM adaptation.",
        "There are some ways in which this research could be continued in the future.",
        "First, we will utilize our approach to mine large-scale corpora by distributed infrastructure system, and investigate the use of our approach for other domains, such as speech translation system.",
        "Second, the significant improvement of LM adaptation based on cross-lingual data selection is exciting, so it will be instructive to explore other knowledge based cross-lingual data selection for LM adaptation, such as latent semantic model."
