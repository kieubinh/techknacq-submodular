        "Importantly, language and music complement each other in many different ways.",
        "For instance, looking at music and language in terms of features, we can observe that music organizes pitch and rhythm in ways that language does not, and it lacks the specificity of language in terms of semantic meaning.",
        "On the other hand, language is built from categories that are absent in music (e.g., nouns and verbs), whereas music seems to have a deeper power over our emotions than does ordinary speech.",
        "Composers, musicians, and researchers in poetry and literature alike have been long fascinated by the combination of language and music, even since the time of the earliest written records of music encountered in musical settings for poetry.",
        "Despite this interest, and despite the long history of the interaction between music and lyrics, there is only little work that explicitly focuses on the connection between music and lyrics.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the connection between the musical and linguistic representations in popular songs, and their role in the expression of affect.",
        "We introduce a novel corpus of lyrics and music, annotated for emotions at line level, and explore the automatic recognition of emotions using both textual and musical features.",
        "Through comparative experiments, we show that emotion recognition can be performed using either textual or musical features, and that the joint use of lyrics and music can improve significantly over classifiers that use only one dimension at a time.",

        "Although several methods have been proposed, including a combination of textual features and beats per minute and MPEG descriptors (Yang and Lee, 2004); individual audio and text classifiers for arousal and valence, followed by a combination through meta-learning (Yang et al2008); and the use of crowdsourcing labeling from Last.fm to collect large datasets of songs annotated for emotions (Laurier et al2008; Hu et al2009), all this previous work was done at song level, and most of it focused on valence-arousal classifications.",
        "None of the previous methods considered the fine-grained classification of emotions at line level, as we do, and none of them considered the six Ekman emotions used in our work.",

        "For instance, the task of music retrieval and music recommendation has received a lot of attention from both the arts and the computer science communities (see for instance (Orio, 2006) for an introduction to this task).",
