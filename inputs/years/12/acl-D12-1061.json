        "We will show that the word model provides a rich set of expansion candidates while the triplet and topic models can effectively select good expansion terms, and that a ranker-based QE system which incorporates all three of these models not only significantly improves Web search result but outperforms other log-based QE methods that are state-of-the-art.",

        "The method outperforms traditional QE methods that do not use log data e.g. the local analysis model of Xu and Croft (1996).",
        "In addition, as pointed out by Cui et al. (2003) there are three important advantages that make log-based QE a promising technology to improve the performance of commercial search engines.",
        "First, unlike traditional QE methods that are based on relevance feedback, log-based QE derives expansion terms from search logs, allowing term correlations to be precomputed offline.",
        "Compared to methods that are based on thesauri either compiled manually (Prager et alu",
        "tomatically from document collections (Jing and Croft 1994), the log-based method is superior in that it explicitly captures the correlation between query terms and document terms, and thus can bridge the lexical gap between them more effectively.",
        "Second, since search logs retrain query-document pairs clicked by millions of users, the term correlations reflect the preference of the majority of users.",
        "Third, the term correlations evolve along with the accumulation of user logs, thus can reflect updated user interests at a specific time.",
        "However, as pointed out by Riezler et al. (2008), Cui et ald method suffers low precision of QE partly because the correlation model does not explicitly capture context information and is susceptible to noise.",
        "Riezler et al.",
        "developed a QE system by retraining a standard phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) system using query-snippet pairs extracted from clickthrough data (Riezler et al. Liu 2010).",
        "The SMT-based system can produce cleaner, more relevant expansion terms because rich context information useful for filtering noisy expansions is captured by combining language model and phrase translation model in its decoder.",
        "Furthermore, in the SMT system all component models are properly smoothed using sophisticated techniques to avoid sparse data problems while the correlation model relies on pure counts of term frequencies.",
        "However, the SMT system is used as a black box in their experiments.",

        "The fact that MRF beats SMT with a statistically significant margin although the former is a much simpler system indicates that text translation and QE are different tasks and some SMT components, designed for the task of regular text translation, are not as effective in selecting expansion terms.",

        "The experiments presented in this section investigate in detail the effectiveness of different models, e.g., the lexicon models and the language models described in Sections 2 and 3, in ranking expansion candidates for QE.",
        "The results are summarized in Rows 5 to 11 in Table 1, where a number of different versions of the ranker-based QE system are compared.",
        "These versions, labeled as MRFf, use the same candidate generator, and differ in the feature classes (which are specified by the subscript f) incorporated in the MRF-based ranker.",
        "In what follows, we focus our discussion on the results of the three lexicon models.",
        "MRFwm (Row 7) uses the word translation model described in Section 2.1.",
        "Both the word model and term correlation model used in MRFtm (Row 6) are context independent.",
        "They differ mainly in the training methods.",
        "For the sake of comparison, in our experiment the word model is",
        "EM-trained with the correlation model as initial point.",
        "Rezler et al. that statistical translation model is superior to correlation model because the EM training captures the hidden alignment information when mapping document terms to query terms, leading to a better smoothed probability distribution.",
        "Our result (Row 7 vs. Row 6) verifies the hypothesis.",
        "Notice that MRFtc outperforms TC in NDCG@1 (Row 6 vs. Row 2) mainly because in the former the expansion candidates are generated by a word translation model and are less noisy.",
        "It is encouraging to observe that the rankers using the triplet model features achieve the QE performance either in par with or better than that of SMT (Rows 8, 10 and 11 vs. Row 3), although the latter is a much more sophisticated system.",
        "The result suggests that not all SMT components are useful for QE.",
        "For example, language models are indispensable for translation but are less effective than word models for QE (Row 5 vs.",
        "Rows 6 and 7).",
        "We also observe that the triplet model not only outperforms significantly the word model due to the use of contextual information (Row 8 vs. Row 7), but also seems to subsume the latter in that combining the features derived from both models in the ranker leads to little improvement over the ranker that uses only the triplet model features (Row 10 vs. Row 8).",
        "The bilingual topic model underperforms the word model and the triplet model (Row 9 vs.",
        "Rows 7 and 8).",
        "However, we found that the bilingual topic model often selects a different set of expansion terms and is complementary to the other two lexicon models.",
        "As a result, unlike the case of combining the word model and triplet model features, incorporating the bilingual topic model features in the ranker leads to some visible improvement in NDCG at all positions (Row 11 vs. Row 10).",
        "To better understand empirically how the MRF-based QE system achieves the improvement, we analyzed the expansions generated by our system in detail and obtained several interesting findings.",
        "First, as expected, in comparison with the word model, the triplet translation model is more effective in benefitting long queries, e.g., notably queries containing questions and queries containing song lyrics.",
        "Second, unlike the two lexicon models, the bilingual topic model tends to generate expansions that are more likely to relate to an entire query rather than individual query terms.",
        "Third, the features involving the order of the expansion terms benefitted queries containing named entities."

        "In comparison with log-based methods studied in this paper, the QE methods based on automatic relevance feedback have been studied much more extensively in the information retrieval (IR) community, and have been proved useful for improving IR performance on benchmark datasets such as TREC (e.g., Rocchio 1971; Xu and Croft 1996; Lavrenko 2001; Zhai and Lafferty 2001).",

        "In this paper we extend the previous log-based QE methods in two directions.",
        "First, we formulate QE as the problem of translating a source language of queries into a target language of documents, represented as titles.",
        "This allows us to adapt the established techniques developed for SMT to QE.",
        "Specially, we propose three lexicon models based on terms, lexicalized triplets, and topics, respectively.",
        "These models are trained on pairs of user queries and the titles of clicked documents using EM.",
        "Second, we present a ranker-based QE system, the heart of which is a MRF-based ranker in which the lexicon models are incorporated as features.",
        "We perform experiments on the Web search task using a real world data set.",
        "Results show that the proposed system outperforms significantly other state-of-the-art QE systems.",
        "This study is part of a bigger, ongoing project, aiming to develop a real-time QE system for Web search, where simplicity is the key to the success.",
        "Thus, what we learned from this study is particularly encouraging.",
        "We demonstrate that with large amounts of clickthrough data for model training, simple lexicon models can achieve state-of-the-art QE performance, and that the MRF-based ranker provides a simple and flexible framework to incorporate a variety of features capturing different types of term dependencies in such an effective way that the Web search performance can be directly optimized."
