      "text": [
        "Despite the significant amount of work on pronoun resolution in the natural language processing community in the past forty years, the problem is still far from being solved.",
        "Its difficulty stems in part from its reliance on sophisticated knowledge sources and inference mechanisms.",
        "The sentence pair below, which we will subsequently refer to as the shout example, illustrates how difficult the problem can be: (1a) Ed shouted at Tim because he crashed the car.",
        "(1b) Ed shouted at Tim because he was angry.",
        "The pronoun he refers to Tim in 1a and Ed in 1b.",
        "Humans can resolve the pronoun easily, but state-of-the-art coreference resolvers cannot.",
        "The reason is that humans have the kind of world knowledge needed to resolve the pronouns that machines do not.",
        "Our world knowledge tells us that if someone is angry, he may shout at other people.",
        "Since Ed shouted, he should be the one who was angry.",
        "Our world knowledge also tells us that we may shout at someone who made a mistake and that crashing a car is a mistake.",
        "Combining these two pieces of evidence, we can easily infer that Tim crashed the car.",
        "Our goal in this paper is to examine the resolution of complex cases of definite pronouns that appear in sentences exemplified by the shout example.",
        "Specifically, each sentence (1) has two clauses separated by a discourse connective (i.e., the connective appears between the two clauses, just like because in the shout example), where the first clause contains two or more candidate antecedents (e.g., Ed and Tim), and the second clause contains the target pronoun (e.g., he); and (2) the target pronoun agrees in gender, number, and semantic class with each candidate antecedent, but does not have any overlap in content words with any of them.",
        "For convenience, we will refer to the target pronoun that appears in this kind of sentences as a difficult pronoun.",
        "Note that many traditional linguistic constraints on coreference are no longer useful for resolving difficult pronouns.",
        "For instance, syntactic constraints such as the Binding Constraints will not be useful, since the pronoun and the candidate antecedents appear in different clauses separated by a discourse connective; and constraints concerning agreement in gender, number, and semantic class will not be useful, since the pronoun and the candidate antecedents are compatible with respect to all these attributes.",
        "Traditionally important clues provided by various",
        "string-matching facilities will not be useful either, since the pronoun and its candidate antecedents do not have any words in common.",
        "As in the shout example, we ensure that each sentence has a twin.",
        "Twin sentences were used extensively by researchers in the 1970s to illustrate the difficulty of pronoun resolution (Hirst, 1981).",
        "We consider two sentences as twins if (1) they are identical up to and possibly including the discourse connective; and (2) the difficult pronouns in them are lexically identical but have different antecedents.",
        "The presence of twins implies that syntactic salience, a commonly-used heuristic in pronoun resolution that prefers the selection of syntactically salient candidate antecedents, may no longer be useful, since the candidate in the subject position is not more likely to be the correct antecedent than the other candidates.",
        "To enable the reader to get a sense of how hard it is to resolve difficult pronouns, Table 1 shows sample twin sentences from our dataset.",
        "Note that state-of-the-art pronoun resolvers (e.g., JavaRAP (Qiu et al. 2004), GuiTaR (Poesio and Kabadjov, 2004), as well as those designed by Mitkov (2002) and Charniak and Elsner (2009)) and coreference resolvers (e.g., BART (Versley et al2008), CherryPicker (Rahman and Ng, 2009), Reconcile (Stoyanov et al2010), the Stanford resolver (Raghunathan et al2010; Lee et al2011)) cannot accurately resolve the difficult pronouns in these structurally simple sentences, as they do not have the mechanism to capture the fine distinctions between twin sentences.",
        "In other words, when given these sentences, the best that the existing resolvers can do to resolve the pronouns is guessing.",
        "This could be surprising to a non-coreference researcher, but it is indeed the state of the art.",
        "A natural question is: why do existing resolvers not attempt to handle difficult pronouns?",
        "One reason could be that these difficult pronouns do not appear frequently in standard evaluation corpora such as MUC, ACE, and OntoNotes (Bagga, 1998; Haghighi and Klein, 2009).",
        "In fact, the Stanford coreference resolver (Lee et al2011), which won the CoNLL-2011 shared task on coreference resolution, adopts the once-popular rule-based approach, resolving pronouns simply with rules that encode the aforementioned traditional linguistic constraints on coreference, such as the Binding constraints and gender and number agreement.",
        "The infrequency of occurrences of difficult pronouns in these standard evaluation corpora by no means undermines their significance, however.",
        "In fact, being able to automatically resolve difficult pronouns has broader implications in artificial intelligence.",
        "Recently, Levesque (2011) has argued that the problem of resolving the difficult pronouns in a carefully chosen set of twin sentences, which he refers to as the Winograd Schema Challenge1, could serve as a conceptually and practically appealing alternative to the well-known Turing Test (Turing, 1Levesque (2011) defines a Winograd Schema as a small reading comprehension test involving the question of which of the two candidate antecedents for the definite pronoun in a given sentence is its correct antecedent.",
        "Levesque names this challenge after Winograd because of his pioneering attempt to use a well-known pair of twin sentences ?",
        "specifically the first pair in Table 1 ?",
        "to illustrate the difficulty of natural language understanding (Winograd, 1972).",
        "Strictly speaking, we are addressing a relaxed version of the Challenge: while Levesque focuses solely on definite pronouns whose resolution requires background knowledge not expressed in the words of a sentence, we do not impose such a condition on a sentence.",
        "1950).",
        "The reason should perhaps be clear given the above discussion: this is an easy task for a subject who can ?understand?",
        "natural language but a challenging task for one who can only make intelligent guesses.",
        "Levesque believes that ?with a very high probability?, anything that can resolve correctly a series of difficult pronouns ?is thinking in the full-bodied sense we usually reserve for people?.",
        "Hence, being able to make progress on this task enables us to move one step closer to building an intelligent machine that can truly understand natural language.",
        "To sum up, an important contribution of our work is that it opens up a new line of research involving a problem whose solution requires a deeper understanding of a text.",
        "With recent advances in knowledge extraction from text, we believe that time is ripe to tackle this problem.",
        "It is worth noting that some researchers have focused on other kinds of anaphors that are hard to resolve, including bridging anaphors (e.g., Poesio et al2004)) and anaphors referring to abstract entities, such as those realized by verb phrases in dialogs (e.g., Byron (2002), Strube and Mu?ller (2003), Mu?ller (2007)).",
        "Nevertheless, to our knowledge, there has been little work that specifically targets difficult pronouns.",
        "Given the complexity of our task, we investigate a variety of sophisticated knowledge sources for resolving difficult pronouns, and combine them via a machine learning approach.",
        "Note that there has been a recent surge of interest in extracting world knowledge from online encyclopedias such as Wikipedia (e.g., Ponzetto and Strube (2006, 2007), Poesio et al.",
        "(2007)), YAGO (e.g., Bryl et al2010), Rahman and Ng (2011), Uryupina et al2011)), and Freebase (e.g., Lee et al2011)).",
        "However, the resulting extractions are primarily IS-A relations (e.g., Barack Obama IS-A U. S. president), which would not be useful for resolving definite pronouns."
