        "News stories are often driven by the quotes made by politicians, sports stars, musicians, and celebrities.",
        "When these stories exit the news cycle, the quotes they contain are often forgotten by both readers and journalists.",
        "A system that automatically extracts quotes and attributes those quotes to the correct speaker would enable readers and journalists to place news in the context of all comments made by a person on a given topic.",
        "Though quote attribution may appear to be a straightforward task, the simple rule-based approaches proposed thus far have produced disappointing results.",
        "Going beyond these to machine learning approaches presents several problems that make quote attribution surprisingly difficult.",
        "The main challenge is that while a large portion of quotes can be attributed to a speaker based on simple rules, the remainder have few or no contextual clues as to who the correct speaker is.",
        "Additionally, many quote sequences, such as dialogues, rely on the reader understanding that there is an alternating sequence of speakers, which creates dependencies between attribution decisions made by a classifier.",
        "Elson and McKeown (2010) is the only study that directly uses machine learning in quote attribution, treating the task as a classification task, where each quote is attributed independently of other quotes.",
        "To handle conversations and similar constructs they use gold standard information about speakers of previous quotes as features for their model.",
        "This is an unrealistic assumption, since gold standard information is not available in practice.",
        "The primary contribution of this paper is that we reformulate quote attribution as a sequence labelling task.",
        "This allows us to use sequence features without having to use the unrealistic gold standard features that were used in Elson and McKeown (2010).",
        "We experiment with three sequence decoding models including greedy, Viterbi and a linear chain Conditional Random Field (CRF).",
        "Furthermore we present results on two new corpora and an augmented version of a third.",
        "The two new corpora are from news articles from the Wall Street Journal and the Sydney Morning Herald respectively, while the third corpus is an extension to the classic literature corpus from Elson and McKeown (2010).",
        "Our results show that a quote attribution system using only realistic features is highly feasible for the news domain, with accuracies of 92.4% on the SMH corpus and 84.1% on the WSJ corpus."

        "Early work into quote attribution by Zhang et al. (2003) focused on identifying when different characters were talking in children's stories, so that a speech synthesis system could read the quoted parts in different voices.",
        "While they were able to extract quotes with high precision and recall, their attribution accuracy was highly dependent on the document in question, ranging from 47.6% to 86.7%.",
        "Mamede and Chaleira (2004) conducted similar research on children's stories written in Portuguese.",
        "Their system proved to be very good at extracting quotes through simple rules, but when using a hand-crafted decision tree to attribute those quotes to a speaker, they achieved an accuracy of only 65.7%.",
        "In the news domain, both Pouliquen et al2007) and Sarmento and Nunes (2009) proposed rule-based systems that work over large volumes of text.",
        "Both systems aimed for high precision at the expense of low recall, as their data contained many redundant quotes.",
        "More recently, SAPIENS, a French-language quote extraction and attribution system, was developed by de La Clergerie et al2011).",
        "It conducts a full parse of the text, which allows it to use patterns to extract direct and indirect quotes, as well as the speaker of each quote.",
        "Their evaluation found that 19 out of 40 quotes (47.5%) had a correct span and author, while a further 19 had an incorrect author, and 4 had an incorrect span.",
        "In related work, Sagot et al2010) built a lexicon of French reported speech verbs, and conducted some analysis of different types of quotes.",
        "Glass and Bangay (2007) approached the task with a three stage method.",
        "For each quote they first find the nearest speech verb, they then find the grammatical actor of that speech verb, and finally they select the appropriate speaker for that actor.",
        "To achieve each of these subtasks they built a model with several manually weighted features that good candidates should possess.",
        "For each subtask they then choose the candidate with the largest weighted sum of features.",
        "Their full approach yields an accuracy of 79.4% on a corpus of manually annotated fiction books.",
        "Schneider et al2010) describe PICTOR, which is principally a quote visualisation tool.",
        "Their task was to find direct and indirect quotes, which they attribute to a text span representing the speaker.",
        "To do this they constructed a specialised grammar, which was built with reference to a small development corpus.",
        "With a permissive evaluation metric their grammar-based approach yielded 86% recall and 75% precision, however this dropped to 52% recall and 56% precision when measured in terms of completely correct quote-speaker pairs.",
        "The work most similar to ours is the work by Elson and McKeown (2010).",
        "Their aim was to automatically identify both quotes and speakers, and then to attribute each quote to a speaker, in a corpus of classic literature that they compiled themselves.",
        "To identify potential speakers they used the Stanford NER tagger (Finkel et al2005) and a method outlined in Davis et al2003) that allowed them to find nominal character references.",
        "They then grouped name variants and pronominal mentions into a coref-erence chain.",
        "To attribute a quote to a speaker they first classified the quotes into categories.",
        "Several of the categories have a speaker explicit in their structure, so they attribute quotes to those speakers with no further processing.",
        "For the remaining categories, they cast the attribution problem as a binary classification task, where each quote-speaker pair has a ?speaker?",
        "or ?not speaker?",
        "label predicted by the classifier.",
        "They then reconciled these independent decisions using various techniques to produce a single speaker prediction for each quote.",
        "For the simple category predictions they achieved 93-99% accuracy, while for the more complicated categories they achieved 63-64%, with an overall result of 83% accuracy.",
        "This compares favourably with their rule-based baseline, which achieved an accuracy of 52%.",
        "While the results of Elson and McKeown (2010) appear encouraging, they are misleading for two reasons.",
        "First their corpus does not include quotes where all three annotators chose different speakers.",
        "While these quotes include some cases where the annotators chose coreferent spans, it also includes cases of legitimate disagreement about the speaker.",
        "An automated system would likely find these cases challenging.",
        "Second both their category predictions and machine learning predictions rely on gold standard information from previous quotes, which is not available in practice.",
        "In our study we address both these issues.",
        "The two categories marked with an asterisk (*) depend on previous decisions."

These probabilities can be multiplied together with the previous decisions to retrieve a joint probability for the entire sequence.",

        "Although they do not come with probabilities, we chose to include the category predictions in our Viterbi model.",

        "It is worth noting that quotes are only assigned to the Conversation category if the two prior quotes had alternating speakers.",
        "As such, during the Viterbi decoding the categorisation of the quote actually needs to be recalculated with regard to the two previous attribution decisions.",
        "By forcing the Viterbi decoder to choose category predictions when they are available, we get the advantage that quote sequences with no intervening text may be forced into the Conversation category, which is typically under-represented otherwise.",

        "When using the binary class model this results in a drop of 25.1% for the LIT corpus, while for the WSJ and SMH corpora the drop is less substantial at 4.4% and 2.6%, respectively.",
        "For the LIT corpus the drop is so severe that it actually performs worse than the simple rule-based system.",
        "Even more surprisingly, when the predictions from previous decisions are used with a simple greedy decoder, the accuracy drops even further for all three corpora.",
        "This indicates that the classifier is putting too much weight on the gold standard sequence features during training, and is misled into making poor decisions when the predicted features are used during test time.",
        "Table 4 shows the results for the n-way class model.",
        "Compared to the binary model, the n-way class model generally produced lower results, although the results were more stable to changes in parameters and decoders.",
        "The only corpus that produced better results with the n-way class model was the WSJ corpus, which does not have full entity coreference information.",
        "This indicates that the n-way model may be helpful when there is more variety in the choice of entities.",
        "The final results we would like to discuss here are the CRF results.",
        "On all three corpora the CRF results are underwhelming.",
        "The major issue that we can see when applying a CRF model to this task is that the sequences that it needs to learn over are entire documents.",
        "This means that for the LIT corpus the training set consisted of only 12 sequences, while",
        "Bold results show the best realistic result for each corpus.",
        "the test set consisted of 6 sequences.",
        "With so few sequences it is unsurprising that the CRF model did not perform well.",
        "The limited range of the first order linear chain model could also have played a part in the poor performance of the CRF models.",
        "However, moving to a higher-order model is problematic as the number of transition probabilities that need to be calculated increases exponentially with the order of the model."
