        "We randomly selected and analyzed 200 misclassified relations for both tasks.",
        "The analysis revealed four types of errors.",
        "Paraphrases We observed that constant relations are prone to be miss-classified as non-constant when more than one paraphrase appear in arg2 and thus the value of arg2 is pretended to change.",
        "For example, America was also referred to as USA or United States of America.",
        "A similar problem was observed for unique relations as well.",
        "Topical bias Topics mentioned in the blog posts are sometimes biased, and such bias can have a negative effect on classification, especially when a relation takes a small number of entity types in arg2 for given arg1.",
        "For example, Jaden Smith, who is one of Will Smith's sons, is frequently mentioned in our time-series text because he co-starred with his father in a movie, while Will Smith's other sons never appeared in our text.",
        "We consider this a possible reason for our method wrongly identifying ?arg1 's son is arg2?",
        "as a unique relation.",
        "Short-/Long-term evolution Since we have aggregated on a monthly basis the 6-year's worth of blog posts, the induced features cannot capture evolutions that occur in shorter or longer intervals.",
        "For example, consider relation ?arg1 beats arg2?",
        "taking Real Madrid as arg1.",
        "Since Real Madrid usually have more than one football match in a month, they can beat several teams in a month, which misleads the classifier to recognize the relation as non-unique.",
        "Similarly when a relation takes more than 6 years to evolve, it will be regarded as constant.",
        "Reference to past, future, or speculative facts The blog authors sometimes refer to relations that do not occur around when they write their posts; such relations actually occurred in the past, will occur in the future, or even speculative.",
        "Since our method exploits the time stamps attached to the posts to associate the relations with time, those relations introduce noises in the frequency distributions.",
        "Although our robust feature induction could in most cases avoid an adverse effect caused by these noises, they sometimes leaded to misclassification."

        "In recent years, much attention has been given to extracting relations from a massive amount of textual data, especially the web (cf. section 1).",
        "Most of those studies, however, explored just extracting relations from text.",
        "Only a few studies, as described below, have discussed classifying those relations.",
        "There has been no previous work on identifying the constancy of relations.",
        "The most relevant research topic is the temporal information extraction (Verhagen et al2007; Verhagen et al2010; Ling and Weld, 2010; Wang et al2010; Hovy et al., 2012).",
        "This is the task of extracting from textual data an event and the time it happened, e.g., Othello was written by Shakespeare in 1602.",
        "Such temporal information alone is not sufficient for identifying the constancy of relations, while we think it would be helpful.",
        "On the other hand, the uniqueness of relations has so far been discussed in some studies.",
        "Ritter et al. (2008) have pointed out the importance of identifying unique relations for various NLP tasks such as contradiction detection, quantifier scope disambiguation, and synonym resolution.",
        "They proposed an EM-style algorithm for scoring the uniqueness of relations.",
        "Lin et al2010) also proposed three algorithms for identifying unique relations.",
        "While those studies discussed the same problem as this paper, they did not point out the importance of the constancy in identifying unique relations (cf. section 4.1)."

        "This paper discussed that the notion of constancy is essential in compiling relations between entities extracted from real-world text and proposed a method for classifying relations on the basis of constancy and uniqueness.",
        "The time-series web text was fully exploited to induce frequency-based features from time-series frequency distribution on relation instances as well as language-based features tailored for individual classification tasks.",
        "Experimental results confirmed that the frequency-based features contributed much to the precision and recall in both identification tasks.",
        "We will utilize the identified properties of the relations to adopt an appropriate strategy to compile their instances.",
        "We also plan to start a spin-off research that acquires paraphrases by grouping values of arg2s for each value of arg1 in a constant, unique relation.",
        "We consider that the notion of constancy will even be beneficial in acquiring world knowledge, other than relations between entities, from text; we aim at extending the notion of constancy to other types of knowledge involving real-world entities, such as concept-instance relations."
