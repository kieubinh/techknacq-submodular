      "heading": "1 Introduction",
      "text": [
        "It is widely agreed that identifying paraphrases is a core task for natural language processing, including applications like document summarization (Barzilay et al1999), Recognizing Textual Entailment (Da-gan et al2005), natural language generation (Zhao et al2010; Ganitkevitch et al2011), and machine translation (Marton et al2009).",
        "As a consequence, many methods have been proposed for generating large paraphrase resources (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Szpektor et al2004; Dolan et al2004).",
        "One of the intuitively appropriate data sources for such collections are parallel or comparable corpora: if two texts are translations of the same foreign document, or if they describe the same underlying scenario, they should contain a reasonable number of sentence pairs that convey the same meaning.",
        "Most approaches that extract paraphrases from parallel texts employ some type of pattern matching: sentences with the same meaning are assumed to share many n-grams (Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Callison-Burch, 2008, among others), many words in their context (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001) or certain slots in a dependency path (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Szpektor et al2004).",
        "Discourse structure has only marginally been considered for this task: For example, Dolan et al2004) extract the first sentences from comparable articles and take them as paraphrases.",
        "Another approach (Del?ger and Zweigenbaum, 2009) matches similar paragraphs in comparable texts, creating smaller comparable documents for paraphrase extraction.",
        "We believe that discourse structure delivers important information for the extraction of paraphrases.",
        "Sentences that play the same role in a certain discourse and have a similar discourse context can be paraphrases, even if a semantic similarity model does not consider them very similar.",
        "This extends the widely applied distributional hypothesis to the discourse level: According to the distributional hypothesis, entities are similar if they share similar contexts.",
        "In our case, entities are whole sentences, and contexts are discourse units.",
        "Based on this assumption, we propose a novel method for collecting paraphrases from parallel texts using discourse information.",
        "We create a new type of parallel corpus by collecting multiple summaries for several TV show episodes.",
        "The discourse structures of those summaries are easy to compare: they all contain the events in the same order as they have appeared on the screen.",
        "This allows us to take sentence order as event-based discourse structure, which is highly parallel for recaps of the same episode.",
        "In its first step, our system uses a sequence align",
        "ment algorithm combined with a state-of-the-art similarity measure.",
        "The approach outperforms informed baselines on the task of sentential paraphrase identification.",
        "The usage of discourse information even contributes more to the final performance than the sentence similarity measure.",
        "As second step, we extract phrase-level paraphrase fragments from the matched sentences.",
        "This step relies on the alignment algorithm's output, and we show that discourse information makes a big difference for the precision of the extraction.",
        "We then add more discourse-based information by preprocessing the text with a coreference resolution system, which results in additional performance improvement.",
        "The paper is structured as follows: first we summarize related work (Sec.",
        "2), and then we give an overview over our perspective on the task and sketch our system pipeline (Sec.",
        "3).",
        "The following two sections describe the details of the sentence matching step (Sec.",
        "4) and the subsequent paraphrase fragment extraction (Sec.",
        "5).",
        "We present both automatic and manual evaluation of the two system components (Sec.",
        "6).",
        "Finally, we conclude the paper and give some hints for future work (Sec.",

        "Previous paraphrase extraction approaches can be roughly characterized under two aspects: 1) data source and 2) granularity of the output.",
        "Both parallel corpora and comparable corpora have been quite well studied.",
        "Barzilay and McKeown (2001) use different English translations of the same novels (i.e., monolingual parallel corpora), while others (Quirk et al2004) experiment on multiple sources of the same news/events, i.e., monolingual comparable corpora.",
        "Commonly used (candidate) comparable corpora are news articles written by different news agencies within a limited time window (Wang and Callison-Burch, 2011).",
        "Other studies focus on extracting paraphrases from large bilingual parallel corpora, which the machine translation (MT) community provides in many varieties.",
        "Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005) as well as Zhao et al2008) take one language as the pivot and match two possible translations in the other languages as paraphrases if they share a common pivot phrase.",
        "As parallel corpora have many alternative ways of expressing the same foreign language concept, large quantities of paraphrase pairs can be extracted.",
        "The paraphrasing task is also strongly related to cross-document event coreference resolution, which is tackled by similar techniques used by the available paraphrasing systems (Bagga and Baldwin, 1999; Tomadaki and Salway, 2005).",
        "Most work in paraphrase acquisition has dealt with sentence-level paraphrases, e.g., (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Dolan et al., 2004; Quirk et al2004).",
        "Our approach for sentential paraphrase extraction is related to the one introduced by Barzilay and Lee (2003), who also employ multiple sequence alignment (MSA).",
        "However, they use MSA at the sentence level rather than at the discourse level.",
        "We take some core ideas from our previous work on mining script information (Regneri et al2010).",
        "In this earlier work, we focused on event structures and their possible realizations in natural language.",
        "The corpus used in those experiments were short crowd-sourced descriptions of everyday tasks written in bullet point style.",
        "We aligned them with a hand-crafted similarity measure that was specifically designed for this text type.",
        "In this current work, we target the general task of extracting paraphrases for events rather than the much more specific script-related task.",
        "The current approach uses a domain-independent similarity measure instead of a specific hand-crafted similarity score and is thus applicable to standard texts.",
        "From an applicational point of view, sentential paraphrases are difficult to use in other NLP tasks.",
        "At the phrasal level, interchangeable patterns (Shinyama et al2002; Shinyama and Sekine, 2003) or inference rules (Lin and Pantel, 2001) are extracted.",
        "In both cases, each pattern or rule contains one or several slots, which are restricted to certain type of words, e.g., named entities (NE) or content words.",
        "They are quite successful in NE-centered tasks, like information extraction, but their level of generalization or coverage is insufficient for applications like Recognizing Textual Entailment (Dinu and Wang, 2009).",
        "The research on general paraphrase fragment extraction at the sub-sentential level is mainly based",
        "on phrase pair extraction techniques from the MT literature.",
        "Munteanu and Marcu (2006) extract sub-sentential translation pairs from comparable corpora using the log-likelihood-ratio of word translation probability.",
        "Quirk et al2007) extract fragments using a generative model of noisy translations.",
        "Our own work (Wang and Callison-Burch, 2011) extends the first idea to paraphrase fragment extraction on monolingual parallel and comparable corpora.",
        "Our current approach also uses word-word alignment, however, we use syntactic dependency trees to compute grammatical fragments.",
        "Our use of dependency trees is inspired by the constituent-tree-based experiments of Callison-Burch (2008)."

        "One possible explanation lies in picking f-score as objective for the optimization of the gap costs for MSA: For the naturally more restrictive word overlap measure, this leads to a more recall-oriented system with a low threshold for aligning sentences, whereas the gap costs for the vector-based system favors a more restrictive alignment with more precise results.",
