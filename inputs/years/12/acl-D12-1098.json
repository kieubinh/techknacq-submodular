        "Examples include constructing polarity lexicons based on lexical graphs from WordNet (Rao and Ravichandran, 2009), constructing polarity lexicons from web data (Velikovich et al. 2010) and unsupervised part-of-speech tagging using label propagation (Das and Petrov, 2011).",
        "The later two approaches construct nearest-neighbor graphs between word pairs by computing nearest neighbors between word pairs from large corpora.",
        "These nearest neighbors form the edges of the graph, with weights given by the distributional similarity (Turney and Pantel, 2010) between terms.",
        "Unfortunately, computing the distributional similarity between all words in a large vocabulary is computationally and memory intensive when working with large amounts of data (Pantel et al., 2009).",
        "This bottleneck is typically addressed by means of commodity clusters.",
        "For example, Pantel et al(2009) compute distributional similarity between 500 million terms over a 200 billion words in 50 hours using 100 quad-core nodes, explicitly storing a similarity matrix between 500 million terms.",
        "In this work, we propose Fast Large-Scale Approximate Graph (FLAG) construction, a system that constructs a fast large-scale approximate nearest-neighbor graph from a large text corpus.",
        "To build this system, we exploit recent developments in the area of approximation, randomization and streaming for large-scale NLP problems (Ravichan-dran et al. 2005; Goyal et al. 2009; Levenberg et al., 2010).",
        "More specifically we exploit work on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) (Charikar, 2002) for computing word-pair similarities from large text collections (Ravichandran et al. 2005; Van Durme and Lall, 2010).",
        "However, Ravichandran et al(2005) approach stored an enormous matrix of all unique words and their contexts in main memory, which is infeasible for very large data sets.",
        "A more efficient online framework to locality sensitive hashing (Van Durme and Lall, 2010; Van Durme and Lall, 2011) computes distributional similarity in a streaming setting.",
        "Unfortunately, their approach can handle only additive features like raw-counts, and not non-linear association scores like pointwise mutual information (PMI), which generates better context vectors for distributional similarity (Ravichandran et al. 2005; Pantel et al. 2009; Turney and Pantel, 2010).",
        "In FLAG, we first propose a novel distributed online-PMI algorithm (Section 3.1).",
        "It is a streaming method that processes large data sets in one pass while distributing the data over commodity clusters",
        "and returns context vectors weighted by pointwise mutual information (PMI) for all the words.",
        "Our distributed online-PMI algorithm makes use of the Count-Min (CM) sketch algorithm (Cormode and Muthukrishnan, 2004) (previously shown effective for computing distributional similarity in our earlier work (Goyal and Daume?",
        "III, 2011)) to store the counts of all words, contexts and word-context pairs using only 8GB of main memory.",
        "The main motivation for using the CM sketch comes from its linearity property (see last paragraph of Section 2) which makes CM sketch to be implemented in distributed setting for large data sets.",
        "In our implementation, FLAG scaled up to 110 GB of web data with 866 million sentences in less than 2 days using 100 quad-core nodes.",
        "Our intrinsic and extrinsic experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of distributed online-PMI.",
        "After generating context vectors from distributed online-PMI algorithm, our goal is to use them to find fast approximate nearest neighbors for all words.",
        "To achieve this goal, we exploit recent developments in the area of existing randomized algorithms for random projections (Achlioptas, 2003; Li et al. 2006), Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) (Charikar, 2002) and improve on previous work done on PLEB (Point Location in Equal Balls) (Indyk and Motwani, 1998; Charikar, 2002).",
        "We propose novel variants of PLEB to address the issue of reducing the preprocessing time for PLEB.",
        "One of the variants of PLEB (FAST-PLEB) with considerably less preprocessing time has effectiveness comparable to PLEB.",
        "We evaluate these variants of PLEB both quantitatively and qualitatively on large data sets.",
        "Finally, we show the applicability of large-scale graphs built from FLAG on two applications: the Google-Sets problem (Ghahra-mani and Heller, 2005), and learning concrete and abstract words (Turney et al. 2011)."
