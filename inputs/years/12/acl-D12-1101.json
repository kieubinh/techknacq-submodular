        "Conditional random fields and other graphical models are at the forefront of many natural language processing (NLP) and information extraction (IE) tasks because they provide a framework for discriminative modeling while succinctly representing dependencies among many related output variables.",
        "Previously, most applications of graphical models were limited to structures where exact inference is possible, for example linear-chain CRFs (Lafferty et al. 2001).",
        "More recently, there has been a desire to include more factors, longer range dependencies, and more sophisticated features; these include skip-chain CRFs for named entity recognition (Sutton and McCallum, 2004), probabilistic DBs (Wick et al. 2010), higher-order models for dependency parsing (Carreras, 2007), entity-wise models for coreference (Culotta et al. 2007; Wick et al. 2009), and global models of relations (Hoff-mann et al. 2011).",
        "The increasing sophistication of these individual NLP components compounded with the community's desire to model these tasks jointly across cross-document considerations has resulted in graphical models for which inference is computationally intractable.",
        "Even popular approximate inference techniques such as loopy belief propagation and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) may be prohibitively slow.",
        "MCMC algorithms such as Metropolis-Hastings are usually efficient for graphical models because the only factors needed to score a proposal are those touching the changed variables.",
        "However, MCMC is slowed in situations where a) the model exhibits variables that have a high-degree (neighbor many factors), b) proposals modify a substantial subset of the variables to satisfy domain constraints (such as transitivity in coreference), or c) evaluating a single factor is expensive, for example when features are based on string-similarity.",
        "For example, the seemingly innocuous proposal changing the entity type of a single entity requires examining all its mentions, i.e. scoring a linear number of factors (in the number of mentions of that entity).",
        "Similarly, evaluating coreference of a mention to an entity also requires scoring factors to all the mentions of the entity.",
        "Often, however, the factors are somewhat redundant, for example, not all mentions of the ?USA?",
        "entity need to be examined to confidently conclude that it is a COUNTRY, or that it is coreferent with ?United",
        "States of America?.",
        "In this paper we propose an approximate MCMC framework that facilitates efficient inference in high-degree graphical models.",
        "In particular, we approximate the acceptance ratio in the Metropolis Hastings algorithm by replacing the exact model score with a stochastic approximation that samples from the set of relevant factors.",
        "We explore two sampling strategies, a fixed proportion approach that samples the factors uniformly, and a dynamic alternative that samples factors until the method is confident about its estimate of the model score.",
