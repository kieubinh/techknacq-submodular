        "Vector space representations have proven useful across a wide variety of text processing applications ranging from document clustering to search relevance measurement.",
        "In these applications, text is represented as a vector in a multidimensional continuous space, and a similarity metric such as cosine similarity can be used to measure the relatedness of different items.",
        "Vector space representations have been used both at the document and word levels.",
        "At the document level, they are effective for applications including information retrieval (Salton and McGill, 1983; Deerwester et al. 1990), document clustering (Deerwester et al. 1990; Xu et al. 2003), search relevance measurement (Baeza-Yates and Ribiero-Neto, 1999) and cross-lingual document retrieval (Platt et al. 2010).",
        "At the word level, vector representations have been used to measure word similarity (Deerwester et al. 1990; Turney and Littman, 2005; Turney, 2006; Turney, 2001; Lin, 1998; Agirre et al. 2009; Reisinger and Mooney, 2010) and for language modeling (Bellegarda, 2000; Coccaro and Jurafsky, 1998).",
        "While quite successful, these applications have typically been consistent with a very general notion of similarity in which basic association is measured, and finer shades of meaning need not be distinguished.",
        "For example, latent semantic analysis might assign a high degree of similarity to opposites as well as synonyms (Lan-dauer and Laham, 1998; Landauer, 2002).",
        "Independent of vector-space representations, a number of authors have focused on identifying different kinds of relatedness.",
        "At the simplest level, we may wish to distinguish between synonyms and antonyms, which can be further differentiated.",
        "For example, in synonymy, we may wish to distinguish hyponyms and hypernyms.",
        "Moreover, Cruse (1986) notes that numerous kinds of antonymy are possible, for example antipodal pairs like ?top-bottom?",
        "or",

        "Despite the existence of a large amount of related work in the literature, distinguishing synonyms and antonyms is still considered as a difficult open problem in general (Poon and Domingos, 2009).",
        "In this paper, we fuse these two strands of research in an attempt to develop a vector space representation in which the synonymy and antonymy are naturally differentiated.",
        "We follow Schwab et al.",
        "(2002) in requiring a representation in which two lexical items in an antonymy relation should lie at opposite ends of an axis.",
        "However, in contrast to the logical axes used previously, we desire that antonyms should lie at the opposite ends of a sphere lying in a continuous and automatically induced vector space.",
        "To generate this vector space, we present a novel method for assigning both negative and positive values to the TF-IDF weights used in latent semantic analysis.",
        "To determine these signed values, we exploit the information present in a thesaurus.",
        "The result is a vector space representation in which synonyms cluster together, and the opposites of a word tend to cluster together at the opposite end of a sphere.",
        "This representation provides several advantages over the raw thesaurus.",
        "First, by finding the items most and least similar to a word, we are able to discover new synonyms and antonyms.",
        "Second, as discussed in Section 5, the representation provides a natural starting point for gradient-descent based optimization.",
        "Thirdly, as we discuss in Section 6, it is straightforward to embed new words into the derived subspace by using information from a large unsupervised text corpus such as Wikipedia.",
