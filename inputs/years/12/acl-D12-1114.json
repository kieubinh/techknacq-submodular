        "The task of noun phrase coreference resolution is to determine which mentions in a text refer to the same real-world entity.",
        "Many methods have been proposed for this problem.",
        "Among them the mention-pair model (McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995) is one of the most influential ones and can achieve the state-of-the-art performance (Bengtson and Roth, 2008).",
        "The mention-pair model splits the task into three parts: mention detection, pairwise classification and mention clustering.",
        "Mention detection aims to identify anaphoric noun phrases, including proper nouns, common noun phrases and pronouns.",
        "Pairwise classification takes a pair of detected anaphoric noun phrase candidates and determines whether they refer to the same entity.",
        "Because these classification decisions are local, they do not guarantee that candidate mentions are partitioned into clusters.",
        "Therefore a mention clustering step is needed to resolve conflicts and generate the final mention clusters.",
        "Much work has been done following the mention-pair model (Soon et al. 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002).",
        "In most work, pairwise classification and mention clustering are done sequentially.",
        "A major weakness of this approach is that pairwise classification considers only local information, which may not be sufficient to make correct decisions.",
        "One way to address this weakness is to jointly learn the pairwise classification model and the mention clustering model.",
        "This idea has been explored to some extent by McCallum and Wellner (2005) using conditional undirected graphical models and by Finley and Joachims (2005) using an SVM-based supervised clustering method.",
        "In this paper, we study how to use a different learning framework, Markov logic (Richardson and Domingos, 2006), to learn a joint model for both pairwise classification and mention clustering under the mention-pair model.",
        "We choose Markov logic because of its appealing properties.",
        "Markov logic is based on first-order logic, which makes the learned models readily interpretable by humans.",
        "Moreover, joint learning is natural under the Markov logic framework, with local pairwise classification and global mention clustering both formulated as weighted first-order clauses.",
        "In fact, Markov logic has been previously used by Poon and Domingos (2008) for coreference resolution and achieved good",
        "results, but it was used for unsupervised coreference resolution and the method was based on a different model, the entity-mention model.",
        "More specifically, to combine mention clustering with pairwise classification, we adopt the commonly used strategies (such as best-first clustering and transitivity constraint), and formulate them as first-order logic formulas under the Markov logic framework.",
        "Best-first clustering has been previously studied by Ng and Cardie (2002) and Bengtson and Roth (2008) and found to be effective.",
        "Transitivity constraint has been applied to coreference resolution by Klenner (2007) and Finkel and Manning (2008), and also achieved good performance.",
        "We evaluate Markov logic-based method on the dataset from CoNLL-2011 shared task.",
        "Our experiment results demonstrate the advantage of joint learning of pairwise classification and mention clustering over independent learning.",
        "We examine best-first clustering and transitivity constraint in our methods, and find that both are very useful for coreference resolution.",
