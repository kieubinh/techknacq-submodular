        "We propose two metrics for abstract anaphora evaluation.",
        "The simplest metric is the percentage of antecedents on which the system and the annotated gold data agree.",
        "We denote this metric as EXACT-M (Exact Match) and compute it as the ratio of number of correctly identified antecedents to the total number of marked antecedents.",
        "This metric is a good indicator of a system's performance; however, it is a rather strict evaluation because, as we noted in section 1, issues generally have no precise boundaries in the text.",
        "So we propose another metric called RLL, which is similar to the ROUGE-L metric (Lin, 2004) used for the evaluation of automatic summarization.",
        "Let the marked antecedents of the gold corpus for k anaphor instances be G = ?g1,g2, ...,gk?",
        "and the system-annotated antecedents be A = ?a1,a2, ...,ak?.",
        "Let the number of words in G and A be m and n respectively.",

        "Then the precision (PRLL) and recall (RRLL) over the whole data set are computed as shown in equations (2) and (3).",
        "PRLL is the total number of word overlaps between the gold and system-annotated antecedents normalized by the number of words in system-annotated antecedents and RRLL is the total number of such word overlaps normalized by the number of words in the gold antecedents.",
        "If the system picks too much text for antecedents, RRLL is high but PRLL is low.",

        "{IP, IVERB, IHEAD}.",

        "The lower bound of FRLL is 0, where no true antecedent has any common substring with the predicted antecedents and the upper bound is 1, where all the predicted and true antecedents are exactly the same.",
        "In our results we represent these scores in terms of percentage.",
        "There are no implemented systems that resolve issue anaphora or abstract anaphora signalled by label nouns in arbitrary text to use as a comparison.",
        "So we compare our results against two baselines: adjacent sentence and random.",
        "The adjacent sentence baseline chooses the previous sentence as the correct antecedent.",
        "This is a high baseline because in our data 84.1% of the antecedents lie within the adjacent sentence.",
        "The random baseline chooses a candidate drawn from a uniform random distribution over the set of candidates.11 11Note that our FRLL scores for both baselines are rather high because candidates often have considerable overlap with one another; hence a wrong choice may still have a high FRLL score.",
        "We carried out two sets of systematic experiments in which we considered all combinations of our twelve feature classes.",
        "The first set consists of 5-fold cross-validation experiments on our training data.",
        "The second set evaluates how well the model built on the training data works on the unseen test data.",
        "Table 3 gives results of our system.",
        "The first two rows are the baseline results.",
        "Rows 3 to 8 give results for some of the best performing feature sets.",
        "All systems based on our features beat both baselines on F-scores and EXACT-M.",
        "The empirically derived feature sets IP (issue patterns) and D (distance) appeared in almost all best feature set combinations.",
        "Removing D resulted in a 6 percentage points drop in FRLL and a 4 percentage points drop in EXACT-M scores.",
        "Surprisingly, feature set ST (syntactic type) was not included in most of the best performing set of feature sets.",
        "The combination of syntactic and semantic feature sets {IP, D, EL, MC, L, SR, DT} gave the best FRLL and EXACT-M scores for the cross-validation experiments.",
        "For the test-data experiments, the combination of semantic and lexical features {D, C, LO, L, SC, SR, DT} gave the best FRLL results, whereas syntactic, discourse, and semantic features {IP, D, C, EL, L, SC, SR, DT} gave the best EXACT-M results.",
        "Overall, row 3 of the table gives reasonable results for both cross-validation and test-data experiments with no statistically significant difference to the corresponding best",
        "EXACT-M scores in rows 6 and 5 respectively.12 To pinpoint the errors made by our system, we carried out three experiments.",
        "In the first experiment, we examined the contribution of issue-specific features versus non-issue features (rows 9 and 10).",
        "Interestingly, when we used only non-issue features, the performance dropped only slightly.",
        "The FRLL results from using only issue-specific features were below baseline, suggesting that the more general features associated with abstract anaphora play a crucial role in resolving this-issue anaphora.",
        "In the second experiment, we determined the error caused by the candidate extractor component of our system.",
        "Row 12 of the table gives the result when an oracle candidate extractor was used to add the correct antecedent in the set of candidates whenever our candidate extractor failed.",
        "This did not affect cross-validation results by much because of the rarity of such instances.",
        "However, in the test-data experiment, the EXACT-M improvements that resulted were statistically significant.",
        "This shows that our resolution algorithm was able to identify antecedents that were arbitrary spans of text.",
        "In the last experiment, we examined the effect of the reduction of the candidate search space.",
        "We assumed an oracle candidate sentence extractor (Row 13) which knows the exact candidate sentence in which the antecedent lies.",
        "We can see that both RLL and EXACT-M scores markedly improved in this setting.",
        "In response to these results, we trained a decision-tree classifier to identify the correct antecedent sentence with simple location and length features and achieved 95% accuracy in identifying the correct candidate sentence."

        "We have demonstrated the possibility of resolving complex abstract anaphora, namely, this-issue anaphora having arbitrary antecedents.",
        "The work takes the annotation work of Botley (2006) and Dipper and Zinsmeister (2011) to the next level by resolving this-issue anaphora automatically.",
        "We proposed a set of 43 automatically extracted features that can be used for resolving abstract anaphora.",
        "12We performed a simple one-tailed, k-fold cross-validated paired t-test at significance level p = 0.05 to determine whether the difference between the EXACT-M scores of two feature classes is statistically significant.",
        "Our results show that general abstract-anaphora resolution features (i.e., other than issue-specific features) play a crucial role in resolving this-issue anaphora.",
        "This is encouraging, as it suggests that the approach could be generalized for other NPs ?",
        "especially NPs having similar semantic constraints such as this problem, this decision, and this conflict.",
        "The results also show that reduction of search space markedly improves the resolution performance, suggesting that a two-stage process that first identifies the broad region of the antecedent and then pinpoints the exact antecedent might work better than the current single-stage approach.",
        "The rationale behind this two-stage process is twofold.",
        "First, the search space of abstract anaphora is large and noisy compared to nominal anaphora.13 And second, it is possible to reduce the search space and accurately identify the broad region of the antecedents using simple features such as the location of the anaphor in the anaphor sentence (e.g., if the anaphor occurs at the beginning of the sentence, the antecedent is most likely present in the previous sentence).",
        "We chose scientific articles over general text because in the former domain the actual referents are seldom discourse deictic (i.e., not present in the text).",
        "In the news domain, for instance, which we have also examined and are presently annotating, a large percentage of this-issue antecedents lie outside the text.",
        "For example, newspaper articles often quote sentences of others who talk about the issues in their own world, as shown in example (6).",
        "(6) As surprising and encouraging to organizers of the movement are the Wall Street names added to their roster.",
        "Prominent among them is Paul Singer, a hedge fund manager who is straight and chairman of the conservative Manhattan Institute.",
        "He has donated more than $8 million to various same-sex marriage efforts, in states including California, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York and Oregon, much of it since 2007.",
        "?It's become something that gradually peo-13If we consider all well-defined syntactic constituents of a sentence as issue candidates, in our data, a sentence has on average 43.61 candidates.",
        "Combinations of several well-defined syntactic constituents only add to this number.",
        "Hence if we consider the antecedent candidates from the previous 2 or 3 sentences, the search space can become quite large and noisy.",
        "ple like myself weren't afraid to fund, weren't afraid to speak out on,?",
        "Mr. Singer said in an interview.",
        "?I'm somebody who is philosophically very conservative, and on this issue I thought that this really was important on the basis of liberty and actual family stability.?",
        "In such a case, the antecedent of this issue is not always in the text of the newspaper article itself, but must be inferred from the context of the quotation and the world of the speaker quoted.",
        "That said, we do not use any domain-specific information in our this-issue resolution model.",
        "Our features are solely based on distance, syntactic structure, and semantic and lexical properties of the candidate antecedents which could be extracted for text in any domain.",
        "Issue anaphora can also be signalled by demonstratives other than this.",
        "However, for our initial study, we chose this issue for two reasons.",
        "First, in our corpus as well as in other general corpora such as the New York Times corpus, issue occurs much more frequently with this than other demonstratives.",
        "Second, we did not want to increase the complexity of the problem by including the plural issues.",
        "Our approach needs further development to make it useful.",
        "Our broad goal is to resolve abstract anaphora signalled by label nouns in all kinds of text.",
        "At present, the major obstacle is that there is very little annotated data available that could be used to train an abstract anaphora resolution system.",
        "And the understanding of abstract anaphora itself is still at an early stage; it would be premature to think about unsupervised approaches.",
        "In this work, we studied the narrow problem of resolution of this-issue anaphora in the medical domain to get a good grasp of the general abstract-anaphora resolution problem.",
        "A number of extensions are planned for this work.",
        "First, we will extend the work to resolve other abstract anaphors (e.g., this decision, this problem).",
        "Second, we will experiment with a two-stage resolution approach.",
        "Third, we would like to explore the effect of including serious discourse structure features in our model.",
        "(The feature sets SC and C encode only shallow discourse information.)",
        "Finally, during annotation, we noted a number of issue patterns (e.g., An open question is X, X is under debate); a possible extension is extracting issues and problems from text using these patterns as seed patterns."
