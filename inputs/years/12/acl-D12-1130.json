        "Distributional models of lexical semantics have seen considerable success at accounting for a wide range of behavioral data in tasks involving semantic cognition (Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Griffiths et al., 2007).",
        "These models have also enjoyed lasting popularity in natural language processing.",
        "Examples involve information retrieval (Salton et al. 1975), word sense discrimination (Schu?tze, 1998), text segmentation (Choi et al. 2001), and numerous studies of lexicon acquisition (Grefenstette, 1994; Lin, 1998).",
        "Despite their widespread use, distributional models have been criticized as ?disembodied?",
        "in that they learn exclusively from linguistic information but are not grounded in perception and action (Perfetti, 1998; Barsalou, 1999; Glenberg and Kaschak, 2002).",
        "This lack of grounding contrasts with many experimental studies suggesting that word meaning is acquired not only from exposure to the linguistic environment but also from our interaction with the physical world (Landau et al. 1998; Bornstein et al. 2004).",
        "Beyond language acquisition, there is considerable evidence across both behavioral experiments and neuroimaging studies that the perceptual associates of words play an important role in language processing (for a review see Barsalou (2008)).",
        "It is thus no surprise that recent years have witnessed the emergence of perceptually grounded distributional models.",
        "An important question in the formulation of such models concerns the provenance of perceptual information.",
        "A few models use feature norms as a proxy for sensorimotor experience (Howell et al. 2005; Andrews et al. 2009; Steyvers, 2010; Johns and Jones, 2012).",
        "These are obtained by asking native speakers to write down attributes they consider important in describing the meaning of a word.",
        "The attributes represent perceived physical and functional properties associated with the referents of words.",
        "For example, apples are typically green or red, round, shiny, smooth, crunchy, tasty, and so on; dogs have four legs and bark, whereas chairs are used for sitting.",
        "Other models focus solely on the visual modality under the assumption that it represents a major source of data from",
        "which humans can learn semantic representations of both linguistic and non-linguistic communicative actions (Regier, 1996).",
        "For example, Feng and Lapata (2010) learn semantic representations from corpora of texts paired with naturally co-occurring images (e.g., news articles and their associated pictures), whereas Bruni et al(2011) learn textual and visual representations independently from distinct data sources.",
        "Aside from the type of data used to capture perceptual information, another important issue concerns how the two modalities (perceptual and textual) are integrated.",
        "A simple solution would be to learn both modalities independently (Bruni et al. 2011) or to infer one modality by means of the other (Johns and Jones, 2012) and to arrive at a grounded representation simply by concatenating the two.",
        "An alternative is to learn from both modalities jointly (Andrews et al. 2009; Feng and Lapata, 2010; Steyvers, 2010).",
        "According to this view, semantic knowledge is gained by simultaneously learning from the statistical structure within each modality assuming both data sources have been generated by a shared set of meanings or topics.",
        "In this paper we undertake the first comparative study of perceptually grounded distributional models.",
        "We examine three models with different assumptions regarding the integration of perceptual and linguistic data.",
        "The first model, originally proposed by Andrews et al(2009), is an extension of latent Dirichlet alcation (LDA, Blei et al(2003)).",
        "It simultaneously considers the distribution of words across contexts in a text corpus and the distribution of words across perceptual features and extracts joint information from both data sources.",
        "Our second model is based on Johns and Jones (2012) who represent the meaning of a word as the concatenation of its textual and its perceptual vector.",
        "Interestingly, their model allows to infer a perceptual vector for words without feature norms, simply by taking into account similar words for which perceptual information is available.",
        "Finally, we propose Canonical Correlation Analysis (Hotelling, 1936; Hardoon et al. 2004) as our third model.",
        "CCA is a data analysis and dimensionality reduction method similar to PCA.",
        "While PCA deals with only one data space, CCA is a technique for joint dimensionality reduction across two Features table dog apple has 4 legs .28 .60 0 used for eating .50 0 0",
        "apple shown as a distribution.",
        "(or more) spaces that provide heterogeneous representations of the same objects.",
        "The assumption is that the representations in these two spaces contain some joint information that is reflected in correlations between them.",
        "In all three models we use feature norms as a proxy for perceptual information.",
        "Despite their shortcomings (e.g., they often cover a small fraction of the vocabulary of an adult speaker due to the effort involved in eliciting them), feature norms provide detailed knowledge about meaning representations and are a useful starting point for studying the integration of perceptual and textual information without being susceptible to the effects of noise, e.g., coming from image processing.",
        "In other words, feature norms can serve as an upper bound of what can be achieved when integrating detailed perceptual information with vanilla text-based distributional models.",
        "Our experimental results demonstrate that joint models give a better fit to human word similarity and association data than a model that considers only one data source, or the simple concatenation of the two sources."

        "The global similarity model performs worst; we conjecture that this is due to the way semantic information is integrated rather than the inference method itself.",

        "In this paper, we have presented a comparative study of semantic representation models which compute word meaning on the basis of linguistic and perceptual information.",
        "The models differ in terms of the mechanisms by which they integrate the two modalities.",
        "In the feature-topic model (Andrews et al., 2009), the textual and perceptual views are integrated via a set of latent components that are inferred from the joint distribution of textual words and perceptual features.",
        "The model based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (Hardoon et al. 2004) integrates the two views by deriving a consensus representation based on the correlation between the linguistic and perceptual modalities.",
        "Johns and Jones?",
        "(2012) similarity-based model simply concatentates the two representations.",
        "In addition, it uses the linguistic representations of words to infer perceptual information when the latter is absent.",
        "Experiments on word association and similarity show that all models benefit from the integration of perceptual data.",
        "We also find that joint models are superior as they obtain a closer fit with human judgments compared with an approach that simply concatenates the two views.",
        "We have also examined how these models perform on the perceptual inference task which has implications for the wider applicability of grounded semantic representation models.",
        "Johns and Jones?",
        "(2012) inference mechanism goes some way towards reconstructing the information contained in the feature norms, however, further",
        "work is needed to achieve representations accurate enough to be useful in semantic tasks.",
        "In this paper we have used McRae et als (2005) norms without any extensive feature engineering other than applying a frequency cut-off.",
        "In the future we plan to experiment with feature selection methods in an attempt to represent perceptual information more succinctly.",
        "For example, it may be that different features are appropriate for different word classes (e.g., color versus event denoting nouns).",
        "Although feature norms are a useful first approximation of perceptual data, the effort involved in eliciting them limits the scope of any computational model based on normed data.",
        "A natural avenue for future work would be to develop semantic representation models that exploit perceptual data that is both naturally occurring and easily accessible (e.g., images, physical simulations).",
