        "With sufficient training data, however, it is often possible to infer this information directly from a document's text.",
        "For example, clues to the geographic location of a document may come from a variety of word features, e.g. to-ponyms (Toronto), geographic features (mountain), culturally local features (hockey), and stylistic or dialectical differences (cool vs. kewl vs. kool).",
        "This article focuses on text-based document ge-olocation, the prediction of the latitude and longitude of a document.",
        "Among the uses for this are region-based search engines; tracing the sources of historical documents; location attribution while summarizing large documents; tailoring of ads while browsing; phishing detection when a user account is accessed from an unexpected location; and ?activist mapping?",
        "(Cobarrubias, 2009), as in the Ushahidi project.1 Geolocation has also been used as a feature in automatic news story identification systems (Sankaranarayanan et al. 2009).",
        "One of the first works on document geolocation is Ding et al(2000), who attempt to automatically determine the geographic scope of web pages.",

        "An alternative to using a discrete set of locations from a gazetteer is to use information retrieval (IR) techniques on a set of geolocated training documents.",

        "Additionally, they group documents via a uniform geodesic grid rather than a clustered set of locations.",
        "This reduces the number of similarity computations and removes the need to perform location clustering altogether, but introduces a new parameter controlling the granularity of the grid.",

        "While the above approaches discretize the continuous surface of the earth, Eisenstein et al(2010) predict locations based on Gaussian distributions over the earth's surface as part of a hierarchical Bayesian model.",
        "This model has many advantages (e.g. the ability to compute a complete probability distribution over locations), but we suspect it will be difficult to scale up to the large document collections needed for high accuracy.",
        "We build on the IR approach with grids while addressing some of the shortcomings of a uniform grid.",
        "Uniform grids are problematic in that they ignore the geographic dispersion of documents and forgo the possibility of greater-granularity geographic resolution in document-rich areas.",
        "Instead, we construct a grid using a k-d tree, which adapts to the size of the training set and the geographic dispersion of the documents it contains.",
        "This can better benefit from more data, since it enables the training set to support more pseudo-documents when there is sufficient evidence to do so, while still ensuring that all pseudo-documents contain comparable amounts of data.",
        "It also has the desirable property of generally requiring fewer active cells than a uniform grid, drastically reducing the computation time required to label a test document.",
        "We show that consistently strong results, robust across both Wikipedia and Twitter datasets, are obtained from the union of the pseudo-documents from a uniform and adaptive grid.",
        "In addition, a simple difference in the choice of location for a given grid cell ?",
        "the centroid of the training documents in the cell, rather than the cell midpoint ?",
        "results in across-the-board improvements.",

        "Dialectal cues are actually the most powerful ones in the GEOTEXT dataset, and it seems our general approach of winner-takes-all (1NN) hurts performance in this respect, especially with a very small training set.",
        "Table 2 shows the performance on the test set of UTGEO2011 with the UTGEO2011-SMALL and UTGEO2011-LARGE training sets.",
        "(Performance for W&B is obtained from their code.4) With the small training set, error is worse than with GEOTEXT, reflecting the wider geographic scope of UTGEO2011.",
        "KDCENTROID is much more effective than the uniform grids, but combining it with the uniform grid in UNIFKDCENTROID edges it out by a small amount.",
        "More interestingly, KDCENTROID is the strongest on all measures when using the large training set, beating UNIFCENTROID by an even larger margin for mean and median error than with",
        "the small training set.",
        "The bucket size used with the large training set is double that for the small one, but there are many more leaves created since there are 42 times more training documents.",
        "With the extra data, the model is able to adapt better to the dispersion of documents and still have strong language models for each leaf that work well even with our greedy winner-takes-all decision method.",
        "Note that the accuracy measurements for all UTGEO2011 experiments are substantially lower than those reported by Cheng et al(2010), who report a best accuracy within 100 miles of 51%.",
        "While UTGEO2011-LARGE contains a substantially larger number of tweets, Cheng et al(2010) limit themselves to users with at least 1,000 tweets, while we have an average of 85 tweets per user.",
        "Their reported mean error distance of 862 km (versus our best mean of 860 km on UTGEO2011-LARGE) indicates that their performance is hurt by a relatively small number of extremely incorrect guesses, as ours appears to be.",
        "Figure 4 provides a learning curve on UTGEO2011's development set for KDCENTROID.",
        "Performance improves greatly with more data, indicating that GEOTEXT performance would also improve with more training data.",
        "Parameters, especially bucket size, need retuning as data increases, which we hope to estimate automatically in future work Finally, we note that the KDCENTROID method was faster than other methods.",
        "While UNIFCENTROID took nearly 19 hours to complete the test run on GEOWIKI (approximately",
        "UTGEO2011 development set.",
        "1.38 seconds per test document), KDCENTROID took only 80 minutes (.078 s/doc).",
        "Similarly, UNIFCENTROID took about 67 minutes to run on UTGEO2011-LARGE (0.34 s/doc), but KDCENTROID took only 27 minutes (0.014 s/doc).",
        "Generally, the KDCENTROID partitioning results in fewer cells, and therefore fewer KL-divergence comparisons.",
        "As expected, the UNIFKDCENTROID model needs as much time as the two together, taking roughly 21 hours for GEOWIKI (1.52 s/doc) and 85 minutes for UTGEO2011-LARGE (0.36 s/doc)."

        "To investigate which words tend to be good indicators of location, we computed, for each word in a development set, the average error distance of documents containing that word.",

        "All are highly locatable terms, as we would expect.",

        "Operettas are a cultural phenomenon largely associated with France, Germany, and England and particularly with specific theaters in these countries.",

        "We have shown how to construct an adaptive grid with k-d trees that enables robust text geolocation and scales well to large training sets.",
        "It will be interesting to consider how it interacts with other strategies for improving the IR-based approach.",
        "For example, the pseudo-document word distributions can be smoothed based on nearby documents or on the structure of the k-d tree itself.",
        "Integrating our system with topic models or Bayesian methods would likely provide more insight with regard to the most discriminative and geolocatable words.",
        "We also expect predicting locations based on multiple most similar documents (kNN) to be more effective in predicting document location, as the second and third most similar training documents together may sometimes be a better estimation of its distribution than just the first alone.",
        "Employing k Nearest Neighbors also allows for more sophisticated methods of location estimation than a single leaf's centroid.",
        "Other possibilities include constructing multiple k-d trees using random subsets of the training data to reduce sensitivity to the bucket size.",
        "In this article, we have considered each user in isolation.",
        "However, Liben-Nowell et al(2005) show that roughly 70% of social network links can be described using geographic information and that the probability of a social link is inversely proportional to geographic distance.",
        "Backstrom et al(2010) verify these results on a much larger scale using geolocated Facebook profiles: their algorithm geolocates users with only the social graph and significantly outperforms IP-based geolocation systems.",
        "Given that both Twitter and Wikipedia have rich, linked document/user graphs, a natural extension to our work here will be to combine text and network prediction for geolocation.",
        "Sadilek et al(2012) also show that a combination of textual and social data can accurately geolocate individual tweets when scope is limited to a single city.",
        "Tweets are temporally ordered and the geographic distance between consecutive tweeting events is constrained by the author's movement.",
        "For tweet-level geolocation, it will be useful to build on work in geolocation that considers the temporal dimension (Chen and Grauman, 2011; Kalogerakis et al. 2009; Sadilek et al. 2012) to make better predictions for documents/images that are surrounded by others with excellent cues, but which are hard to resolve themselves."
