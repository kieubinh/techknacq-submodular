      "text": [
        "Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is the task of assigning each of the words in a given piece of text a contextually suitable grammatical category.",
        "This is not trivial since words can play different syntactic roles in different contexts, e.g., can is a noun in ?I opened a can of coke.?",
        "but a verb in ?I can write.?",
        "Traditionally, linguists have classified English words into the following eight basic POS categories: noun, pronoun, adjective, verb, adverb, preposition, conjunction, and interjection; this list is often extended a bit, e.g., with determiners, particles, participles, etc., but the number of categories considered is rarely more than 15.",
        "Computational linguistics works with a larger inventory of POS tags, e.g., the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. 1993) uses 48 tags: 36 for part-of-speech, and 12 for punctuation and currency symbols.",
        "This increase in the number of tags is partially due to finer granularity, e.g., there are special tags for determiners, particles, modal verbs, cardinal numbers, foreign words, existential there, etc., but also to the desire to encode morphological information as part of the tags.",
        "For example, there are six tags for verbs in the Penn Treebank: VB (verb, base form; e.g., sing), VBD (verb, past tense; e.g., sang), VBG (verb, gerund or present participle; e.g., singing), VBN (verb, past participle; e.g., sung) VBP (verb, non-3rd person singular present; e.g., sing), and VBZ (verb, 3rd person singular present; e.g., sings); these tags are morpho-syntactic in nature.",
        "Other corpora have used even larger tagsets, e.g., the Brown corpus (Kuc?era and Francis, 1967) and the Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen (LOB) corpus (Johansson et al. 1986) use 87 and 135 tags, respectively.",
        "POS tagging poses major challenges for morphologically complex languages, whose tagsets encode a lot of additional morpho-syntactic features (for most of the basic POS categories), e.g., gender, number, person, etc.",
        "For example, the BulTreeBank (Simov et al. 2004) for Bulgarian uses 680 tags, while the Prague Dependency Treebank (Hajic?, 1998) for Czech has over 1,400 tags.",
        "Below we present experiments with POS tagging for Bulgarian, which is an inflectional language with rich morphology.",
        "Unlike most previous work, which has used a reduced set of POS tags, we use all 680 tags in the BulTreeBank.",
        "We combine prior linguistic knowledge and statistical learning, achieving accuracy comparable to that reported for state-of-the-art systems for English.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of related work, Section 3 describes Bulgarian morphology, Section 4 introduces our approach, Section 5 describes the datasets, Section 6 presents our experiments in detail, Section 7 discusses the results, Section 8 offers application-specific error analysis, and Section 9 concludes and points to some promising directions for future work."

      "text": [
        "Most research on part-of-speech tagging has focused on English, and has relied on the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. 1993) and its tagset for training and evaluation.",
        "The task is typically addressed as a sequential tagging problem; one notable exception is the work of Brill (1995), who proposed non-sequential transformation-based learning.",
        "A number of different sequential learning frameworks have been tried, yielding 96-97% accuracy: Lafferty et al(2001) experimented with conditional random fields (CRFs) (95.7% accuracy), Ratnaparkhi (1996) used a maximum entropy sequence classifier (96.6% accuracy), Brants (2000) employed a hidden Markov model (96.6% accuracy), Collins (2002) adopted an averaged perception discriminative sequence model (97.1% accuracy).",
        "All these models fix the order of inference from left to right.",
        "Toutanova et al(2003) introduced a cyclic dependency network (97.2% accuracy), where the search is bi-directional.",
        "Shen et al(2007) have further shown that better results (97.3% accuracy) can be obtained using guided learning, a framework for bidirectional sequence classification, which integrates token classification and inference order selection into a single learning task and uses a perceptron-like (Collins and Roark, 2004) passive-aggressive classifier to make the easiest decisions first.",
        "Recently, Tsuruoka et al. (2011), proposed a simple perceptron-based classifier applied from left to right but augmented with a lookahead mechanism that searches the space of future actions, yielding 97.3% accuracy.",
        "For morphologically complex languages, the problem of POS tagging typically includes morphological disambiguation, which yields a much larger number of tags.",
        "For example, for Arabic, Habash and Rambow (2005) used support vector machines (SVM), achieving 97.6% accuracy with 139 tags from the Arabic Treebank (Maamouri et al., 2003).",
        "For Czech, Hajic?",
        "et al(2001) combined a hidden Markov model (HMM) with linguistic rules, which yielded 95.2% accuracy using an inventory of over 1,400 tags from the Prague Dependency Treebank (Hajic?, 1998).",
        "For Icelandic, Dredze and Wallenberg (2008) reported 92.1% accuracy with 639 tags developed for the Icelandic frequency lexicon (Pind et al. 1991), they used guided learning and tag decomposition: First, a coarse POS class is assigned (e.g., noun, verb, adjective), then, additional fine-grained morphological features like case, number and gender are added, and finally, the proposed tags are further reconsidered using non-local features.",
        "Similarly, Smith et al(2005) decomposed the complex tags into factors, where models for predicting part-of-speech, gender, number, case, and lemma are estimated separately, and then composed into a single CRF model; this yielded competitive results for Arabic, Korean, and Czech.",
        "Most previous work on Bulgarian POS tagging has started with large tagsets, which were then reduced.",
        "For example, Dojchinova and Mihov (2004) mapped their initial tagset of 946 tags to just 40, which allowed them to achieve 95.5% accuracy using the transformation-based learning of Brill (1995), and 98.4% accuracy using manually crafted linguistic rules.",
        "Similarly, Georgiev et al(2009), who used maximum entropy and the BulTreeBank (Simov et al. 2004), grouped its 680 fine-grained POS tags into 95 coarse-grained ones, and thus improved their accuracy from 90.34% to 94.4%.",
        "Simov and Osenova (2001) used a recurrent neural network to predict (a) 160 morpho-syntactic tags (92.9% accuracy) and (b) 15 POS tags (95.2% accuracy).",
        "Some researchers did not reduce the tagset: Savkov et al(2011) used 680 tags (94.7% accuracy), and Tanev and Mitkov (2002) used 303 tags and the BULMORPH morphological ana-lyzer (Krushkov, 1997), achieving P=R=95%."

      "text": [
        "Bulgarian is an Indo-European language from the Slavic language group, written with the Cyrillic alphabet and spoken by about 9-12 million people.",
        "It is also a member of the Balkan Sprachbund and thus differs frommost other Slavic languages: it has no case declensions, uses a suffixed definite article (which has a short and a long form for singular masculine), and lacks verb infinitive forms.",
        "It further uses special evidential verb forms to express unwitnessed, retold, and doubtful activities.",
        "Bulgarian is an inflective language with very rich morphology.",
        "For example, Bulgarian verbs have 52 synthetic wordforms on average, while pronouns have altogether more than ten grammatical features (not necessarily shared by all pronouns), including case, gender, person, number, definiteness, etc.",
        "This rich morphology inevitably leads to ambiguity proliferation; our analysis of BulTreeBank shows four major types of ambiguity: 1.",
        "Between the wordforms of the same lexeme, i.e., in the paradigm.",
        "For example, divana, an inflected form of divan (?sofa?, masculine), can mean (a) ?the sofa?",
        "(definite, singular, short definite article) or (b) a count form, e.g., as in dva divana (?two sofas?).",
        "2.",
        "Between two or more lexemes, i.e., conversion.",
        "For example, kato can be (a) a subordinator meaning ?as, when?, or (b) a preposition meaning ?like, such as?.",
        "3.",
        "Between a lexeme and an inflected wordform of another lexeme, i.e., across-paradigms.",
        "For example, politika can mean (a) ?the politician?",
        "(masculine, singular, definite, short definite article) or (b) ?politics?",
        "(feminine, singular, indefinite).",
        "4.",
        "Between the wordforms of two or more lexemes, i.e., across-paradigms and quasi-conversion.",
        "For example, vrvi can mean (a) ?walks?",
        "(verb, 2nd or 3rd person, present tense) or (b) ?strings, laces?",
        "(feminine, plural, indefinite).",
        "Some morpho-syntactic ambiguities in Bulgarian are occasional, but many are systematic, e.g., neuter singular adjectives have the same forms as adverbs.",
        "Overall, most ambiguities are local, and thus arguably resolvable using n-grams, e.g., compare hubavo dete (?beautiful child?",
        "), where hubavo is a neuter adjective, and ?Pe hubavo.?",
        "(?I sing beautifully.?",
        "), where it is an adverb of manner.",
        "Other ambiguities, however, are non-local and may require discourse-level analysis, e.g., ?Vidh go.?",
        "can mean ?I saw him.",
        "?, where go is a masculine pronoun, or ?I saw it.",
        "?, where it is a neuter pronoun.",
        "Finally, there are ambiguities that are very hard or even impossible1 to resolve, e.g., ?Deteto vleze veselo.?",
        "can mean both ?The child came in happy.?",
        "(veselo is an adjective) and ?The child came in happily.?",
        "(it is an adverb); however, the latter is much more likely.",
        "of the Penn Treebank were allowed to use tag combinations for inherently ambiguous cases: JJ|NN (adjective or noun as prenominal modifier), JJ|VBG (adjective or gerund/present participle), JJ|VBN (adjective or past participle), NN|VBG (noun or gerund), and RB|RP (adverb or particle).",
        "In many cases, strong domain preferences exist about how various systematic ambiguities should be resolved.",
        "We made a study for the newswire domain, analyzing a corpus of 546,029 words, and we found that ambiguity type 2 (lexeme-lexeme) prevailed for functional parts-of-speech, while the other types were more frequent for inflecting parts-of-speech.",
        "Below we show the most frequent types of morpho-syntactic ambiguities and their frequency in our corpus: ?",
        "na: preposition (?of?)",
        "vs. emphatic particle, with a ratio of 28,554 to 38; ?",
        "da: auxiliary particle (?to?)",
        "vs. affirmative particle, with a ratio of 12,035 to 543; ?",
        "e: 3rd person present auxiliary verb (?to be?)",
        "vs. particle (?well?)",
        "vs. interjection (?wow?",
        "), with a ratio of 9,136 to 21 to 5; ?",
        "singular masculine noun with a short definite article vs. count form of a masculine noun, with a ratio of 6,437 to 1,592; ?",
        "adverb vs. neuter singular adjective, with a ratio of 3,858 to 1,753.",
        "Overall, the following factors should be taken into account when modeling Bulgarian morpho-syntax: (1) locality vs. non-locality of grammatical features, (2) interdependence of grammatical features, and (3) domain-specific preferences."

        "Line 3 uses the POS tags listed in the lexicon as features, i.e., as soft suggestions only.",
        "Line 4 is like line 3, but the list of feature-tags proposed by the lexicon is filtered by the contextual linguistic rules.",

        "Overall, we improved over almost all previously published results.",
        "Our accuracy is second only to the manual rules approach of Dojchinova and Mihov (2004).",
        "Note, however, that they used 40 tags only, i.e., their inventory is 17 times smaller than ours.",
        "Moreover, they have optimized their tagset specifically to achieve very high POS tagging accuracy by choosing not to attempt to resolve some inherently hard systematic ambiguities, e.g., they do not try to choose between second and third person past singular verbs, whose inflected forms are identical in Bulgarian and hard to distinguish when the subject is not present (Bulgarian is a pro-drop language).",
        "In order to compare our results more closely to the smaller tagsets in Table 5, we evaluated our best model with respect to (a) the first letter of the tag only (which is part-of-speech only, no morphological information; 13 tags), e.g., Ncmsf becomes N, and (b) the first two letters of the tag (POS + limited morphological information; 49 tags), e.g., Ncmsf becomes Nc.",
        "This yielded 99.30% accuracy for (a) and 98.85% for (b).",

        "Our best token-level accuracy of 97.98% is comparable and even slightly better than the state-of-the-art results for English: 97.33% when using Penn Treebank data only (Shen et al. 2007), and 97.50% for Penn Treebank plus some additional unlabeled data (S?gaard, 2011).",
        "Of course, our results are only indirectly comparable to English.",
        "Still, our performance is impressive because (1) our model is trained on 253,526 tokens only while the standard training sections 0-18 of the Penn Treebank contain a total of 912,344 tokens, i.e., almost four times more, and (2) we predict 680 rather than just 48 tags as for the Penn Treebank, which is 14 times more.",
        "Note, however, that (1) we used a large external morphological lexicon for Bulgarian, which yielded about 50% error reduction (without it, our accuracy was 95.72% only), and (2) our train/dev/test sentences are generally shorter, and thus arguably simpler for a POS tagger to analyze: we have 17.4 words per test sentence in the BulTreeBank vs. 23.7 in the Penn Treebank.",
        "Our results also compare favorably to the state-of-the-art results for other morphologically complex languages that use large tagsets, e.g., 95.2% for Czech with 1,400+ tags (Hajic?",
        "et al 2001), 92.1% for Icelandic with 639 tags (Dredze and Wallenberg, 2008), 97.6% for Arabic with 139 tags (Habash and Rambow, 2005)."
