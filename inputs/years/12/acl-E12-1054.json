        "Measuring the contextual fitness of a term in its context is a key component in different NLP applications like speech recognition (Inkpen and De?silets, 2005), optical character recognition (Wick et al. 2007), co-reference resolution (Bean and Riloff, 2004), or malapropism detection (Bol-shakov and Gelbukh, 2003).",
        "The main idea is always to test what fits better into the current context: the actual term or a possible replacement that is phonetically, structurally, or semantically similar.",
        "We are going to focus on malapropism detection as it allows evaluating measures of contextual fitness in a more direct way than evaluating in a complex application which always entails influence from other components, e.g. the quality of the optical character recognition module (Walker et al. 2010).",
        "A malapropism or real-word spelling error occurs when a word is replaced with another correctly spelled word which does not suit the context, e.g. ?People with lots of honey usually live in big houses.",
        "?, where ?money?",
        "was replaced with ?honey?.",
        "Besides typing mistakes, a major source of such errors is the failed attempt of automatic spelling correctors to correct a misspelled word (Hirst and Budanitsky, 2005).",
        "A real-word spelling error is hard to detect, as the erroneous word is not misspelled and fits syntactically into the sentence.",
        "Thus, measures of contextual fitness are required to detect words that do not fit their contexts.",
        "Existing measures of contextual fitness can be categorized into knowledge-based (Hirst and Budanitsky, 2005) and statistical methods (Mays et al., 1991; Wilcox-OHearn et al. 2008).",
        "Both test the lexical cohesion of a word with its context.",
        "For that purpose, knowledge-based approaches employ the structural knowledge encoded in lexical-semantic networks like WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), while statistical approaches rely on co-occurrence counts collected from large corpora, e.g. the Google Web1T corpus (Brants and Franz, 2006).",
        "So far, evaluation of contextual fitness measures relied on artificial datasets (Mays et al. 1991; Hirst and Budanitsky, 2005) which are created by taking a sentence that is known to be correct, and replacing a word with a similar word from the vocabulary.",
        "This has a couple of disadvantages: (i) the replacement might be a synonym of the original word and perfectly valid in the given context, (ii) the generated error might",
        "be very unlikely to be made by a human, and (iii) inserting artificial errors often leads to unnatural sentences that are quite easy to correct, e.g. if the word class has changed.",
        "However, even if the word class is unchanged, the original word and its replacement might still be variants of the same lemma, e.g. a noun in singular and plural, or a verb in present and past form.",
        "This usually leads to a sentence where the error can be easily detected using syntactical or statistical methods, but is almost impossible to detect for knowledge-based measures of contextual fitness, as the meaning of the word stays more or less unchanged.",
        "To estimate the impact of this issue, we randomly sampled 1,000 artificially created real-word spelling errors1 and found 387 singular/plural pairs and 57 pairs which were in another direct relation (e.g. adjective/adverb).",
        "This means that almost half of the artificially created errors are not suited for an evaluation targeted at finding optimal measures of contextual fitness, as they overestimate the performance of statistical measures while underestimating the potential of semantic measures.",
        "In order to investigate this issue, we present a framework for mining naturally occurring errors and their contexts from the Wikipedia revision history.",
        "We use the resulting English and German datasets to evaluate statistical and knowledge-based measures.",
        "We make the full experimental framework publicly available2 which will allow reproducing our experiments as well as conducting follow-up experiments.",
        "The framework contains (i) methods to extract natural errors from Wikipedia, (ii) reference implementations of the knowledge-based and the statistical methods, and (iii) the evaluation datasets described in this paper."

        "real-word spelling errors at some point, which are then corrected in subsequent revisions of the same article.",

        "To our knowledge, we are the first to create a dataset of naturally occurring errors based on the revision history of Wikipedia.",
        "Max and Wis-niewski (2010) used similar techniques to create a dataset of errors from the French Wikipedia.",
        "However, they target a wider class of errors including non-word spelling errors, and their class of real-word errors conflates malapropisms as well as other types of changes like reformulations.",
        "Thus, their dataset cannot be easily used for our purposes and is only available in French, while our framework allows creating datasets for all major languages with minimal manual effort.",
        "Another possible source of real-word spelling errors are learner corpora (Granger, 2002), e.g. the Cambridge Learner Corpus (Nicholls, 1999).",
        "However, annotation of errors is difficult and costly (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010), only a small fraction of observed errors will be real-word spelling errors, and learners are likely to make dif",
        "ferent mistakes than proficient language users.",
        "Islam and Inkpen (2009) presented another statistical approach using the Google Web1T data (Brants and Franz, 2006) to create the n-gram model.",
        "It slightly outperformed the approach by Mays et al(1991) when evaluated on a corpus of artificial errors based on the WSJ corpus.",
        "However, the results are not directly comparable, as Mays et al(1991) used a much smaller n-gram model and our results in Section 5.1 show that the size of the n-gram model has a large influence on the results.",
        "Eventually, we decided to use the Mays et al(1991) approach in our study, as it is easier to adapt and augment.",
        "In a re-evaluation of the statistical model by Mays et al(1991), Wilcox-OHearn et al(2008) found that it outperformed the knowledge-based method by Hirst and Budanitsky (2005) when evaluated on a corpus of artificial errors based on the WSJ corpus.",
        "This is consistent with our findings on the artificial errors based on the Brown corpus, but - as we have seen in the previous section - evaluation on the naturally occurring errors shows a different picture.",
        "They also tried to improve the model by permitting multiple corrections and using fixed-length context windows instead of sentences, but obtained discouraging results.",
        "All previously discussed methods are unsupervised in a way that they do not rely on any training data with annotated errors.",
        "However, real-word spelling correction has also been tackled by supervised approaches (Golding and Schabes, 1996; Jones and Martin, 1997; Carlson et al. 2001).",
        "Those methods rely on predefined confusion-sets, i.e. sets of words that are often confounded e.g. {peace, piece} or {weather, whether}.",
        "For each set, the methods learn a model of the context in which one or the other alternative is more probable.",
        "This yields very high precision, but only for the limited number of previously defined confusion sets.",
        "Our framework for extracting natural errors could be used to increase the number of known confusion sets."

        "In this paper, we evaluated two main approaches for measuring the contextual fitness of terms: the statistical approach by Mays et al(1991) and the knowledge-based approach by Hirst and Budanitsky (2005) on the task of detecting real-word spelling errors.",
        "For that purpose, we extracted a dataset with naturally occurring errors and their contexts from the Wikipedia revision history.",
        "We show that evaluating measures of contextual fitness on this dataset provides a more realistic picture of task performance.",
        "In particular, using artificial datasets overestimates the performance of the statistical approach, while it underestimates the performance of the knowledge-based approach.",
        "We show that n-gram models targeted towards the domain from which the errors are sampled do not improve the performance of the statistical approach if larger n-gram models are available.",
        "We further show that the performance of the knowledge-based approach can be improved by using semantic relatedness measures that incorporate knowledge beyond the taxonomic relations in a classical lexical-semantic resource like WordNet.",
        "Finally, by combining both approaches, significant increases in precision or recall can be achieved.",
        "In future work, we want to evaluate a wider range of contextual fitness measures, and learn how to combine them using more sophisticated combination strategies.",
        "Both - the statistical as well as the knowledge-based approach - will benefit from a better model of the typist, as not all edit operations are equally likely (Kernighan et al., 1990).",
        "On the side of the error extraction, we are going to further improve the extraction process by incorporating more knowledge about the revisions.",
        "For example, vandalism is often reverted very quickly, which can be detected when looking at the full set of revisions of an article.",
        "We hope that making the experimental framework publicly available will foster future research in this field, as our results on the natural errors show that the problem is still quite challenging."
