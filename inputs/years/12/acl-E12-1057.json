        "Text prediction methods have been developed for several different purposes.",
        "The older algorithms were built as communicative devices for people with disabilities, such as motor and speech impairments.",
        "More recently, text prediction is developed for writing with reduced keyboards, specifically for writing (composing messages) on mobile devices (Garay-Vitoria and Abascal, 2006).",
        "All modern methods share the general idea that previous context (which we will call the ?buffer?)",
        "can be used to predict the next block of characters (the ?predictive unit?).",
        "If the user gets correct suggestions for continuation of the text then the number of keystrokes needed to type the text is reduced.",
        "The unit to be predicted by a text prediction algorithm can be anything ranging from a single character (which actually does not save any keystrokes) to multiple words.",
        "Single words are the most widely used as prediction units because they are recognizable at a low cognitive load for the user, and word prediction gives good results in terms of keystroke savings (Garay-Vitoria and Abascal, 2006).",
        "There is some variation among methods in the size and type of buffer used.",
        "Most methods use character n-grams as buffer, because they are powerful and can be implemented independently of the target language (Carlberger, 1997).",
        "In many algorithms the buffer is cleared at the start of each new word (making the buffer never larger than the length of the current word).",
        "In the paper by (Van den Bosch and Bogers, 2008), two extensions to the basic prefix-model are compared.",
        "They found that an algorithm that uses the previous n characters as buffer, crossing word borders without clearing the buffer, performs better than both a prefix character model and an algorithm that includes the full previous word as feature.",
        "In addition to using the previously typed characters and/or words in the buffer, word characteristics such as frequency and recency could also be taken into account (Garay-Vitoria and Abascal, 2006).",
        "Possible evaluation measures for text prediction are the proportion of words that are correctly predicted, the percentage of keystrokes that could maximally be saved (if the user would always make the correct decision), and the time saved by the use of the algorithm (Garay-Vitoria and Abascal, 2006).",
        "The performance that can be obtained by text prediction algorithms depends on the language they are evaluated on.",
        "Lower results are obtained for higher-inflected languages such as German than for low-inflected languages such as English (Matiasek et al. 2002).",
        "In their overview of text prediction systems, (Garay-Vitoria and Abascal, 2006) report performance scores ranging from 29% to 56% of keystrokes saved.",
        "An important factor that is known to influence the quality of text prediction systems, is training",
        "set size (Lesher et al. 1999; Van den Bosch, 2011).",
        "The paper by (Van den Bosch, 2011) shows log-linear learning curves for word prediction (a constant improvement each time the training corpus size is doubled), when the training set size is increased incrementally from 102 to 3?107 words.",
        "3 Our approach to text prediction We implement a text prediction algorithm for Dutch, which is a productive compounding language like German, but has a somewhat simpler inflectional system.",
        "We do not focus on the effect of training set size, but on the effect of text type and topic domain differences.",
        "Our approach to text prediction is largely inspired by (Van den Bosch and Bogers, 2008).",
        "We experiment with two different buffer types that are based on character n-grams: ?",
        "?Prefix of current word?",
        "contains all characters of only the word currently keyed in, where the buffer shifts by one character position with every new character.",
        "?",
        "?Buffer15?",
        "buffer also includes any other characters keyed in belonging to previously keyed-in words.",
        "Modeling character history beyond the current word can naturally be done with a buffer model in which the buffer shifts by one position per character, while a typical left-aligned prefix model (that never shifts and fixes letters to their positional feature) would not be able to do this.",
        "In the buffer, all characters from the text are kept, including whitespace and punctuation.",
        "The predictive unit is one token (word or punctuation symbol).",
        "In both the buffer and the prediction label, any capitalization is kept.",
        "At each point in the typing process, our algorithm gives one suggestion: the word that is the most likely continuation of the current buffer.",
        "We save the training data as a classification data set: each character in the buffer fills a feature slot and the word that is to be predicted is the classification label.",

        "around the mean, while the leave-one-out experiments lead to a larger number of samples with low prediction scores and a larger number of samples with high prediction scores.",
        "This is also reflected by the higher standard deviation for Neuro-QA than for Medical Wikipedia.",
        "Since both the leave-one-out training on the Neuro-QA questions and the Medical Wikipedia led to good results but behave differently for different portions of the test data, we also evaluated a combination of both corpora on our test set: We created training corpora consisting of the Medical Wikipedia corpus, complemented by 90% of the Neuro-QA questions, testing on the remaining 10% of the Neuro-QA questions.",
        "This led to mean percentage of saved keystrokes of 28.6%, not significantly higher than just the Medical Wikipedia corpus."

        "In Section 1, we asked two questions: (1) ?What is the effect of text type differences on the quality of a text prediction algorithm??",
        "and (2) ?What is the best choice of training data if domain-and text type-specific data is sparse??",
        "By training and testing our text prediction algorithm on four different text types (Wikipedia, Twitter, transcriptions of conversational speech and FAQ) with equal corpus sizes, we found that there is a clear effect of text type on text prediction quality: training and testing on the same text type",
        "gave percentages of saved keystrokes between 27 and 34%; training on a different text type caused the scores to drop to percentages between 16 and 28%.",
        "In our case study, we compared a number of training corpora for a specific data set for which training data is sparse: questions about neurological issues.",
        "We found significant differences between the text prediction scores obtained with the six training corpora: the Twitter and Speech corpora were the least suited, followed by the Wikipedia and FAQ corpus.",
        "The highest scores were obtained by training the algorithm on the medical pages from Wikipedia, immediately followed by leave-one-out experiments on the 359 neurological questions.",
        "The large differences between the lexical coverage of the medical domain played a central role in the scores for the different training corpora.",
        "Because we obtained good results by both the Medical Wikipedia corpus and the neuro-QA questions themselves, we opted for a combination of both data types as training corpus in the initial version of the online text prediction application.",
        "Currently, a demonstration version of the application is running for ComPoli-users.",
        "We hope to collect questions from these users to retrain our algorithm with more representative examples."
