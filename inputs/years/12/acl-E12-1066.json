        "Paradigms are a cornerstone of grammars in the European tradition.",
        "A classical Latin grammar has five paradigms for nouns (?declensions?) and four for verbs (?conjugations?).",
        "The modern reference on French verbs, Bescherelle (Bescherelle, 1997), has 88 paradigms for verbs.",
        "Swedish grammars traditionally have, like Latin, five paradigms for nouns and four for verbs, but a modern computational account (Hellberg, 1978), aiming for more precision, has 235 paradigms for Swedish.",
        "Mathematically, a paradigm is a function that produces inflection tables.",
        "Its argument is a word string (either a dictionary form or a stem), and its value is an n-tuple of strings (the word forms):",
        "We assume that the exponent n is determined by the language and the part of speech.",
        "For instance, English verbs might have n = 5 (for sing, sings, sang, sung, singing), whereas for French verbs in Bescherelle, n = 51.",
        "We assume the tuples to be ordered, so that for instance the French second person singular present subjunctive is always found at position 17.",
        "In this way, word-paradigm pairs can be easily converted to morphogical lexica and to transducers that map form descriptions to surface forms and back.",
        "A properly designed set of paradigms permits a compact representation of a lexicon and a user-friendly way to extend it.",
        "Different paradigm systems may have different numbers of paradigms.",
        "There are two reasons for this.",
        "One is that traditional paradigms often in fact require more arguments than one:",
        "Here m ? n and the set of arguments is a subset of the set of values.",
        "Thus the so-called fourth verb conjugation in Swedish actually needs three forms to work properly, for instance sitta, satt, suttit for the equivalent of sit, sat, sat in English.",
        "In Hellberg (1978), as in the French Bescherelle, each paradigm is defined to take exactly one argument, and hence each vowel alternation pattern must be a different paradigm.",
        "The other factor that affects the number of paradigms is the nature of the string operations allowed in the function P .",
        "In Hellberg (1978), noun paradigms only permit the concatenation of suffixes to a stem.",
        "Thus the paradigms are identified with suffix sets.",
        "For instance, the inflection patterns bil?bilar (?car?cars?) and nyckel?nycklar (?key?keys?) are traditionally both treated as instances of the second declension, with the plural ending ar and the contraction of the unstressed e in the case of nyckel.",
        "But in Hellberg, the word nyckel has nyck as its ?technical stem?, to which the paradigm numbered 231 adds the singular ending eland the plural ending lar.",
        "The notion of paradigm used in this paper allows multiple arguments and powerful string operations.",
        "In this way, we will be able to reduce the number of paradigms drastically: in fact, each lexical category (noun, adjective, verb), will have just one paradigm but with a variable number of arguments.",
        "Paradigms that follow this design will be called smart paradigms and are introduced in Section 2.",
        "Section 3 defines the notions of predictability and complexity of smart paradigm systems.",
        "Section 4 estimates these figures for four different languages of increasing richness in morphology: English, Swedish, French, and Finnish.",
        "We also evaluate the smart paradigms as a data compression method.",
        "Section 5 explores some uses of smart paradigms in lexicon building.",
        "Section 6 compares smart paradigms with related techniques such as morphology guessers and extraction tools.",
        "Section 7 concludes."

        "In this paper, we will assume a notion of paradigm that allows multiple arguments and arbitrary computable string operations.",
        "As argued in (Kaplan and Kay, 1994) and amply demonstrated in (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003), no generality is lost if the string operators are restricted to ones computable by finite-state transducers.",
        "Thus the examples of paradigms that we will show (only informally), can be converted to matching and replacements with regular expressions.",
        "For example, a majority of French verbs can be defined by the following paradigm, which analyzes a variable-size suffix of the infinitive form and dispatches to the Bescherelle paradigms (identified by a number and an example verb):",
        "Notice that the cases must be applied in the given order; for instance, the last case applies only to those verbs ending with er that are not matched by the earlier cases.",
        "Also notice that the above paradigm is just like the more traditional ones, in the sense that we cannot be sure if it really applies to a given verb.",
        "For instance, the verb partir ends with ir and would hence receive the same inflection as finir; however, its real conjugation is number 26 in Bescherelle.",
        "That mkV uses 19 rather than number 26 has a good reason: a vast majority of ir verbs is inflected in this conjugation, and it is also the productive one, to which new ir verbs are added.",
        "Even though there is no mathematical difference between the mkV paradigm and the traditional paradigms like those in Bescherelle, there is a reason to call mkV a smart paradigm.",
        "This name implies two things.",
        "First, a smart paradigm implements some 'artificial intelligence' to pick the underlying 'stupid' paradigm.",
        "Second, a smart paradigm uses heuristics (informed guessing) if string matching doesn't decide the matter; the guess is informed by statistics of the distributions of different inflection classes.",
        "One could thus say that smart paradigms are ?second-order?",
        "or ?meta-paradigms?, compared to more traditional ones.",
        "They implement a lot of linguistic knowledge and intelligence, and thereby enable tasks such as lexicon building to be performed with less expertise than before.",

        "for foncer and ?06?",
        "for marcher, the lexicographer can simply write ?mkV?",
        "for all verbs instead of choosing from 88 numbers.",
        "In fact, just ?V?, indicating that the word is a verb, will be enough, since the name of the paradigm depends only on the part of speech.",
        "This follows the model of many dictionaries and",
        "methods of language teaching, where characteristic forms are used instead of paradigm identifiers.",
        "For instance, another variant of mkV could use as its second argument the first person plural present indicative to decide whether an ir verb is in conjugation 19 or in 26:",
        "?",
        "conj26partir(s), if for some x, s = x+ir and t = x+ons ?",
        "conj19finir(s), if s ends with ir ?",

        "mkV(s) otherwise (fall-back to the one-argument paradigm) In this way, a series of smart paradigms is built for each part of speech, with more and more arguments.",
        "The trick is to investigate which new forms have the best discriminating power.",
        "For ease of use, the paradigms should be displayed to the user in an easy to understand format, e.g. as a table specifying the possible argument lists: verb parler verb parler, parlons verb parler, parlons, parlera, parla, parle?",
        "noun chien noun chien, masculine noun chien, chiens, masculine Notice that, for French nouns, the gender is listed as one of the pieces of information needed for lexicon building.",
        "In many cases, it can be inferred from the dictionary form just like the inflection; for instance, that most nouns ending e are feminine.",

        "Usually (92% to 100% in Table 1), adding a second form (m = 2) is enough to cover all words.",
        "Then the best practice for lexicon writing might be always to give these two forms instead of just one.",
        "Smart paradigms can also be used for an automatic bootstrapping of a list of base forms into a full form lexicon.",
        "As again shown by the last column of Table 1, one form alone can provide an excellent first approximation in most cases.",
        "What is more, it is often the case that uncaught words belong to a limited set of ?irregular?",
        "words, such as the irregular verbs in many languages.",
        "All new words can then be safely inferred from the base form by using smart paradigms."

        "Smart paradigms were used for a study of Finnish morphology in (Ranta, 2008).",
        "The present paper can be seen as a generalization of that experiment to more languages and with the notion of code",
        "complexity.",
        "Also the paradigms for Finnish are improved here (cf.",
        "Section 4.4 above).",
        "Even though smart paradigm-like descriptions are common in language text books, there is to our knowledge no computational equivalent to the smart paradigms of GF.",
        "Finite state morphology systems often have a function called a guesser, which, given a word form, tries to guess either the paradigm this form belongs to or the dictionary form (or both).",
        "A typical guesser differs from a smart paradigms in that it does not make it possible to correct the result by giving more forms.",
        "Examples of guessers include (Chanod and Tapanainen, 1995) for French, (Hlava?c?ova?, 2001) for Czech, and (Nakov et al. 2003) for German.",
        "Another related domain is the unsupervised learning of morphology where machine learning is used to automatically build a language morphology from corpora (Goldsmith, 2006).",
        "The main difference is that with the smart paradigms, the paradigms and the guess heuristics are implemented manually and with a high certainty; in unsupervised learning of morphology the paradigms are induced from the input forms with much lower certainty.",
        "Of particular interest are (Chan, 2006) and (Dreyer and Eisner, 2011), dealing with the automatic extraction of paradigms from text and investigate how good these can become.",
        "The main contrast is, again, that our work deals with handwritten paradigms that are correct by design, and we try to see how much information we can drop before losing correctness.",
        "Once given, a set of paradigms can be used in automated lexicon extraction from raw data, as in (Forsberg et al. 2006) and (Cle?ment et al. 2004), by a method that tries to collect a sufficient number of forms to determine that a word belongs to a certain paradigm.",
        "Smart paradigms can then give the method to actually construct the full inflection tables from the characteristic forms."

      "heading": "7 Conclusion",
      "text": [
        "We have introduced the notion of smart paradigms, which implement the linguistic knowledge involved in inferring the inflection of words.",
        "We have used the paradigms to estimate the predictability of nouns and verbs in English, Swedish, French, and Finnish.",
        "The main result is that, with the paradigms used, less than two forms in average is always enough.",
        "In half of the languages and categories, one form is enough to predict more than 90% of forms correctly.",
        "This gives a promise for both manual lexicon building and automatic bootstrapping of lexicon from word lists.",
        "To estimate the overall complexity of inflection systems, we have also measured the size of the source code for the paradigm systems.",
        "Unsurprisingly, Finnish is around seven times as complex as English, and around three times as complex as Swedish and French.",
        "But this cost is amortized when big lexica are built.",
        "Finally, we looked at smart paradigms as a data compression method.",
        "With simple morphologies, such as English nouns, bzip2 gave a better compression of the lexicon than the source code using paradigms.",
        "But with Finnish verbs, the compression rate was almost 20 times higher with paradigms than with bzip2.",
        "The general conclusion is that smart paradigms are a good investment when building morphological lexica, as they ease the task of both human lexicographers and automatic bootstrapping",
        "methods.",
        "They also suggest a method to assess the complexity and learnability of languages, related to Kolmogorov complexity.",
        "The results in the current paper are just preliminary in this respect, since they might still tell more about particular implementations of paradigms than about the languages themselves."
