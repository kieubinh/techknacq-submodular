        "We have also studied the effect of training the classifier on data derived from one genre and testing on instances derived from a different genre.",
        "Table 7 shows that instances from legal texts are more homogeneous, as the classifier obtains higher accuracy when testing and training only on legal instances (90.0%).",
        "In addition, legal texts are also more informative, because when both legal and health genres are combined as training data, only instances from the health genre show a significant increased accuracy (93.7%).",
        "These results reveal that the health texts are the most heterogeneous ones.",
        "In fact, we also found subsets of the legal documents where our method achieves an accuracy of 94.6%, implying more homogeneous texts."

        "We extract the erroneously classified instances of our training data and classify the errors.",
        "According to the distribution of the errors per class (Table 8) we take into account the following four classes of errors for the analysis: (a) impersonal constructions classified as zero subjects, (b) impersonal constructions classified as explicit subjects, (c) zero subjects classified as explicit subjects, and (d) explicit subjects classified as zero subjects.",
        "The diagonal numbers are the true predicted cases.",
        "The classification of impersonal constructions is less balanced than the ones for explicit subjects and zero subjects.",
        "Most of the wrongly identified instances are classified as explicit subject, given that this class is the largest one.",
        "On the other hand, 25% of the zero subjects are classified as explicit subject, while only 8% of",

        "A great variety of different patterns are found.",
        "We mention only the linguistic characteristics in the errors which at least double the corpus general trends.",
        "In all groups (a-d) there is a tendency of using the following elements: post-verbal prepositions, auxiliary verbs, future verbal tenses, subjunctive verbal mode, negation, punctuation marks appearing before the verb and the preceding noun phrases, concessive and adverbial subordinate clauses.",
        "In groups (a) and (b) the lemma of the verb may play a relevant role, for instance verb haber (?there is/are?)",

        "appears 12 times more.",

        "Assuming that the same accuracy could be maintained, on our data set the combined performance could potentially be in the range of 95%.",
        "Future research goals are the extrinsic evaluation of our system by integrating our system in NLP tasks and its adaptation to other Romance pro-drop languages.",
        "Finally, we believe that our ML approach could be improved as it is the first attempt of this kind."
