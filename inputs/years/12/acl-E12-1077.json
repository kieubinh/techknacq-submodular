        "Systems that generate route instructions are becoming an increasingly interesting application area for natural language generation (NLG) systems.",
        "Car navigation systems are ubiquitous already, and with the increased availability of powerful mobile devices, the widespread use of pedestrian navigation systems is on the horizon.",
        "One area in which NLG systems could improve existing navigation systems is in the use of landmarks, which would enable them to generate instructions such as ?turn right after the church?",
        "instead of ?after 300 meters?.",
        "It has been shown in human-human studies that landmark-based route instructions are easier to understand (Lovelace et al. 1999) than distance-based ones and reduce driver distraction in in-car settings (Burnett, 2000), which is crucial for improved traffic safety (Stutts et al. 2001).",
        "From an NLG perspective, navigation systems are an obvious application area for situated generation, for which there has recently been increasing interest (see e.g. (Lessmann et al. 2006; Koller et al. 2010; Striegnitz and Majda, 2009)).",
        "Current commercial navigation systems use only trivial NLG technology, and in particular are limited to distance-based route instructions.",
        "Even in academic research, there has been remarkably little work on NLG for landmark-based navigation systems.",
        "Some of these systems rely on map resources that have been hand-crafted for a particular city (Malaka et al. 2004), or on a combination of multiple complex resources (Raubal and Winter, 2002), which effectively limits their coverage.",
        "Others, such as Dale et al(2003), focus on non-interactive one-shot instruction discourses.",
        "However, commercially successful car navigation systems continuously monitor whether the driver is following the instructions and provide modified instructions in real time when necessary.",
        "That is, two key problems in designing NLG systems for car navigation instructions are the availability of suitable map resources and the ability of the NLG system to generate instructions and react to driving errors in real time.",
        "In this paper, we explore solutions to both of these points.",
        "We present the Virtual Co-Pilot, a system which generates route instructions for car navigation using landmarks that are extracted from the open-source OpenStreetMap resource.",
        "The system computes a route plan and splits it into episodes that end in driving maneuvers.",
        "It then selects landmarks that describe the locations of these driving maneuvers, and aggregates instructions such that they can be presented (via a TTS system) in the time available within the episode.",
        "The system monitors the user's position and computes new, corrective instructions when the user leaves the intended path.",
        "We evaluate our system using a driving simulator, and compare it to a baseline that is designed to replicate a typical commercial navigation system.",

        "What makes an object in the environment a good landmark has been the topic of research in various disciplines, including cognitive science, computer science, and urban planning.",
        "Lynch (1960) defines landmarks as physical entities that serve as external points of reference that stand out from their surroundings.",
        "Kaplan (1976) specified a landmark as ?a known place for which the individual has a well-formed representation?.",
        "Although there are different definitions of landmarks, a common theme is that objects are considered landmarks if they have some kind of cognitive salience (both in terms of visual distinctiveness and frequeny of interaction).",
        "The usefulness of landmarks in route instructions has been shown in a number of different human-human studies.",
        "Experimental results from Lovelace et al(1999) show that people not only use landmarks intuitively when giving directions, but they also perceive instructions that are given to them to be of higher quality when those instructions contain landmark information.",
        "Similar findings have also been reported by Michon and Denis (2001) and Tom and Denis (2003).",
        "Regarding car navigation systems specifically, Burnett (2000) reports on a road-based user study which compared a landmark-based navigation system to a conventional car navigation system.",
        "Here the provision of landmark information in route directions led to a decrease of navigational errors.",
        "Furthermore, glances at the navigation display were shorter and fewer, which indicates less driver distraction in this particular experimental condition.",
        "Minimizing driver distraction is a crucial goal of improved navigation systems, as driver inattention of various kinds is a leading cause of traffic accidents (25% of all police-reported car crashes in the US in 2000, according to Stutts et al(2001)).",
        "Another road-based study conducted by May and Ross (2006) yielded similar results.",
        "One recurring finding in studies on landmarks in navigation is that some user groups are able to benefit more from their inclusion than others.",
        "This is particularly the case for female users.",
        "While men tend to outperform women in wayfind-ing tasks, completing them faster and with fewer navigation errors (c.f.",
        "Allen (2000)), women are likely to show improved wayfinding performance when landmark information is given (e.g. Saucier et al(2002)).",
        "Despite all of this evidence from human-human studies, there has been remarkably little research on implemented navigation systems that use landmarks.",
        "Commercial systems make virtually no use of landmark information when giving directions, relying on metric representations instead (e.g. ?Turn right in one hundred meters?).",
        "In academic research, there have only been a handful of relevant systems.",
        "A notable example is the DEEP MAP system, which was created in the SmartKom project as a mobile tourist information system for the city of Heidelberg (Malaka and Zipf, 2000; Malaka et al. 2004).",
        "DEEP MAP uses landmarks as waypoints for the planning of touristic routes for car drivers and pedestrians, while also making use of landmark information in the generation of route directions.",
        "Raubal and Winter (2002) combine data from digital city maps, facade images, cultural heritage information, and other sources to compute landmark descriptions that could be used in a pedestrian navigation system for the city of Vienna.",
        "The key to the richness of these systems is a set of extensive, manually curated geographic and landmark databases.",
        "However, creation and maintenance of such databases is expensive, which makes it impractical to use these systems outside of the limited environments for which they were created.",
        "There have been a number of suggestions for automatically acquiring landmark data from existing electronic databases, for instance cadas-tral data (Elias, 2003) and airborne laser scans (Brenner and Elias, 2003).",
        "But the raw data for these approaches is still hard to obtain; informa",
        "tion about landmarks is mostly limited to geometric data and does not specify the semantic type of a landmark (such as ?church?",
        "); and updating the landmark database frequently when the real world changes (e.g., a shop closes down) remains an open issue.",
        "The closest system in the literature to the research we present here is the CORAL system (Dale et al. 2003).",
        "CORAL generates a text of driving instructions with landmarks out of the output of a commercial web-based route planner.",
        "Unlike CORAL, our system relies purely on open-source map data.",
        "Also, our system generates driving instructions in real time (as opposed to a single discourse before the user starts driving) and reacts in real time to driving errors.",
        "Finally, we evaluate our system thoroughly for driving errors, user satisfaction, and driver distraction on an actual driving task, and find a significant improvement over the baseline."

        "The most striking result of the evaluation is that there was a significant reduction of looks to the navigation display, even if only for one group of users.",
        "Female users looked at the navigation screen less and more rarely with the Virtual Co-Pilot compared to the baseline system.",
        "In a real car navigation system, this translates into a driver who spends less time looking away from the road, i.e. a reduction in driver distraction and an increase in traffic safety.",
        "This suggests that female users learned to trust the landmark-based instructions, an interpretation that is further supported by the trends we found in the subjective questionnaire.",
        "We did not find these differences in the male user group.",
        "Part of the reason may be the known gender differences in landmark use we mentioned in Section 2.",
        "But interestingly, the two significantly worse ratings by male users concerned the correct timing of instructions and the feedback for driving errors, i.e. issues regarding the system's real-time capabilities.",
        "Although our system does not yet perform ideally on these measures, this confirms our initial hypothesis that the NLG system must track the user's behavior and schedule its utterances appropriately.",
        "This means that earlier systems such as CORAL, which only compute a one-shot discourse of route instructions without regard to the timing of the presentation, miss a crucial part of the problem.",
        "Apart from the exceptions we just discussed, the landmark-based system tended to score comparably or a bit worse than the baseline on the other subjective questions.",
        "This may partly be due to the fact that the subjects were familiar with existing commercial car navigation systems and not used to landmark-based instructions.",
        "On the other hand, this finding is also consistent with results of other evaluations of NLG systems, in which an improvement in the objective task usefulness of the system does not necessarily correlate with improved scores from subjective questionnaires (Gatt et al. 2009)."

      "heading": "6 Conclusion",
      "text": [
        "In this paper, we have described a system for generating real-time car navigation instructions with landmarks.",
        "Our system is distinguished from earlier work in its reliance on open-source map data from OpenStreetMap, from which we extract both the street graph and the potential landmarks.",
        "This demonstrates that open resources are now informative enough for use in wide-coverage navigation NLG systems.",
        "The system then chooses appropriate landmarks at decision points, and continuously monitors the driver's behavior to provide modified instructions in real time when driving errors occur.",
        "We evaluated our system using a driving simulator with respect to driving errors, user satisfaction, and driver distraction.",
        "To our knowledge, we have shown for the first time that a landmark-based car navigation system outperforms a baseline significantly; namely, in the amount of time female users spend looking away from the road.",
        "In many ways, the Virtual Co-Pilot is a very simple system, which we see primarily as a starting point for future research.",
        "The evaluation confirmed the importance of interactive real-time NLG for navigation, and we therefore see this as a key direction of future work.",
        "On the other hand, it would be desirable to generate more complex referring expressions (?the tall church?).",
        "This would require more informative map data, as well as a formal model of visual salience (Kelleher and van Genabith, 2004; Raubal and Winter, 2002).",
