        "Sociolinguistic research on speech style and its resulting social interpretation has frequently focused on the ways in which shifts in style are used to achieve strategic goals within interactions, for example the ways in which speakers may adapt their speaking style to suppress differences and accentuate similarities between themselves and their interlocutors in order to build solidarity (Coupland, 2007; Eckert & Rickford, 2001; Sanders, 1987).",
        "We refer to this stylistic convergence as speech style accommodation.",
        "In the language technologies community, one targeted practical benefit of such modeling has been the achievement of more natural interactions with speech dialogue systems (Levitan et al. 2011).",
        "Monitoring social processes from speech or language data has other practical benefits as well, such as enabling monitoring how beneficial an interaction is for group learning (Ward & Litman, 2007; Gweon, 2011), how equal participation is within a group (DiMicco et al. 2004), or how conducive an environment is for fostering a sense of belonging and identification with a community (Wang et al. 2011).",
        "Typical work on computational models of speech style accommodation have focused on specific aspects of style that may be accommodated, such as the frequency or timing of pauses or backchannels (i.e., words that show attention like ?Un huh?",
        "or ?ok?",
        "), pitch, or speaking rate (Ed-lund et al. 2009; Levitan & Hirschberg, 2011).",
        "In this paper, we present an unsupervised Dynamic Bayesian Model that allows us to model speech style accommodation in a way that does not require us to specify which linguistic features we are targeting.",
        "We explore a space of models defined by two independent factors, namely the direct influence of one speaker's style on another speaker's style and the influence of the relational gestalt between the two speakers that motivates the stylistic accommodation, and thus may keep the accommodation moving consistently, with the same momentum.",
        "Prior work has explored the influence of the first factor.",
        "However, because accommodation reflects social processes that extend over time within an interaction, one may expect a certain consistency of motion within the stylistic shift.",
        "Furthermore, we can leverage this consistency of style shift to identify socially meaningful variation without specifying ahead of time which",
        "particular stylistic elements we are focusing on.",
        "Our evaluation provides support for this hypothesis.",
        "When stylistic shifts are focused on specific linguistic features, then measuring the extent of the stylistic accommodation is simple since a speaker's style may be represented on a one or two dimensional space, and movement can then be measured precisely within this space using simple linear functions.",
        "However, the rich sociolinguistic literature on speech style accommodation highlights a much greater variety of speech style characteristics that may be associated with social status within an interaction and may thus be beneficial to monitor for stylistic shifts.",
        "Unfortunately, within any given context, the linguistic features that have these status associations, which we refer to as indexicality, are only a small subset of the linguistic features that are being used in some way.",
        "Furthermore, which features carry this in-dexicality are specific to a context.",
        "Thus, separating the socially meaningful variation from variation in linguistic features occurring for other reasons is akin to searching for the proverbial needle in a haystack.",
        "It is this technical challenge that we address in this paper.",
        "In the remainder of the paper we review the literature on speech style accommodation both from a sociolinguistic perspective and from a technological perspective in order to motivate our hypothesis and proposed model.",
        "We then describe the technical details of our model.",
        "Next, we present an experiment in which we test our hypothesis about the nature of speech style accommodation and find statistically significant confirming evidence.",
        "We conclude with a discussion of the limitations of our model and directions for ongoing research."

        "The concept of what we refer to as Speech Style Accommodation has its roots in the field of the Social Psychology of Language, where the many ways in which social processes are reflected through language, and conversely, how language influences social processes, are the objects of investigation (Giles & Coupland, 1991).",
        "As a first step towards leveraging this broad range of language processes, we refer to one very specific topic, which has been referred to as entrainment, priming, accommodation, or adaptation in other computational work (Levitan & Hirschberg, 2011).",
        "Specifically we refer to the finding that conversational partners may shift their speaking style within the interaction, either becoming more similar or less similar to one another.",

        "Stylistic shifts may occur at a variety of levels of speech or language representation.",

        "in New York City, that reflected differences in age, regional identification, and so-cioeconomic status (Labov, 2010a,b).",
        "Distribution of backchannels and pauses have also been the target of prior work on accommodation (Levitan & Hirschberg, 2011).",
        "These effects may be moderated by other social factors.",
        "For example, Bilous & Krauss (1988) found that females accommodated to their male partners in conversation in terms of average number of words uttered per turn.",
        "For example, Hecht et al(1989) reported that extroverts are more listener adaptive than introverts and hence extroverts converged more in their data.",
        "Accommodation could be measured either from textual or speech content of a conversation.",

        "One of the main motives for accommodation is to decrease social distance.",
        "On a variety of levels, speech style accommodation has been found to affect the impression that speakers give within an interaction.",
        "For example, Welkowitz & Feldstein (1970) found that when speakers become more similar to their partners, they are liked more by partners.",

        "The prior work described in this section can be thought of as taking the influence of the partner's style directly on the speaker's style within an instant as the floor shifts from one speaker to the next.",
        "Thus, no consistency in the manner in which the accommodation is occurring is explicitly encouraged by the model.",
        "The major advantage of consistency of motion within the style shift over time is that it provides a sign post for identifying which style variation within the speech is salient with respect to social interpretation within a specific interaction so that the model may remain agnostic and may thus be applied to a variety of interactions that differ with respect to which stylistic features are salient in this respect."

        "The second aspect is that although this is a local phenomenon, because it is a reflection of a social process that extends over a period of time, there will be some persistence of accommodation over longer periods of time, as characterized by the accommodation state.",
        "We presented two different operationalizations of the accommodation state above, namely Asymmetric and Symmetric.",
        "Accommodation is a phenomenon that occurs within interactions between speakers; we can expect not to observe accommodation occurring between individuals that have never met and are not interacting.",
        "On average, then, we expect to see more evidence of speech style accommodation in pairs of individuals who are interacting (i.e., Real Pairs) than in pairs of individuals who are not interacting and have never met (i.e., Constructed Pairs).",
        "Thus, we may evaluate the extent to which our model is sensitive to social dynamics within pairs by the extent to which it is able to distinguish between true conversation between Real Pairs of speaker and synthetic conversation between Constructed Pairs.",
        "A similar experimental paradigm has been adopted in prior work on speech style accommodation (Levitan et al. 2011).",
        "Hypothesis: Our hypothesis is that models that explicitly represent the notion that accommodation occurs over a span of time with consistency of momentum will achieve better success at distinguishing between Real Pairs and Constructed Pairs than models that do not.",
        "Experimental Manipulation: Thus, using the model we have just described, we are able to test our hypothesis using a 2 ?",
        "3 factorial design in which one factor is the inclusion of direct links from the style of one speaker to the style",
        "of the other speaker, which we refer to as the DirectInfluence (DI) factor, with values True (T) and False (F), and the second factor is the inclusion of links from style states to and from Accommodation states, which we refer to as the IndirectInfluence (II) factor, with values False (F), Asymmetric (A), and Symmetric (S).",
        "The result of this 2 ?",
        "3 factorial design are the 6 different models described in Section 3, namely",
        "Corpus: The success criterion in our experiment is the extent to which models of speech style accommodation are able to distinguish between Real Pairs and Constructed pairs.",
        "In order to set up this comparison, we began with a corpus of debates between students about the reasons for the fall of the Ottoman Empire.",
        "We obtained this corpus from researchers who originally collected it to investigate issues related to learning from conversational interactions (Nokes et al. 2010).",
        "The full corpus contains interactions between 76 pairs of students who interacted for 8 minutes.",
        "Within each pair, one student was assigned the role of arguing that the fall of the Ottoman empire was due to internal causes, whereas the other student was assigned the role of arguing that the fall of the Ottoman empire was due to external causes.",
        "Each student was given a 4 page packet of supporting information for their side of the debate to draw from in the interaction.",
        "The speech from each participant was recorded on a separate channel.",
        "As a first step, we aligned the speech recordings automatically to their transcriptions at the word and turn level.",
        "After aligning the corpus at the word level, we identify the turn interval of each partner in the conversation.",
        "We use 66 of the debates out of the complete set of 76 for the experiments discussed in this paper.",
        "We had to eliminate 10 dialogues where the segmentation and alignment failed.",
        "For each of our models, we used the same 3 fold cross-validation.",
        "Participants: Participants were all male undergraduate students between the ages of 18 and 25.",
        "In prior studies, it has been shown that accommodation varies based on gender, age and familiarity between partners.",
        "This corpus is particularly appropriate because it controls for most of these factors.",
        "Furthermore, because the participants did not know each other before the debate, we can assume that if accommodation happened, it was only during the conversation.",
        "Real versus Constructed Pairs: In our analysis below, we compare measured accommodation between pairs of humans who had a real conversation and a constructed pair in which one person from that conversation is paired with a constructed partner, where the partner's side of the conversation was constructed from turns that occurred in other conversations.",
        "We set up this comparison in order to isolate speech style convergence from lexical convergence when we evaluate the performance of our model.",
        "The difference between the measured accommodation between real and constructed pairs is treated as a weak op-erationalization of model accuracy at measuring speech style accommodation.",
        "For each of the 20 Real pairs in the test corpus we composed one Constructed Pair.",
        "Each Constructed Pair comprised one student from the corresponding Real Pair (i.e., the Real Student) and a Constructed Partner that resembled the real partner in content but not necessarily style.",
        "We did this by iterating through the real partner's turns, replacing each with a turn that matched as well as possible in terms of lexical content but came from a different conversation.",
        "Lexical content match was measured in terms of cosine similarity.",
        "Turns were selected from the other Real pairs.",
        "Thus, the Constructed Partner had similar content to the corresponding real partner on a turn by turn basis, but the style of expression could not be influenced by the Real Student.",
        "Thus, ideally we should not see evidence of speech style accommodation within the Constructed Pairs.",
        "Experimental Procedure: For each of the four models we computed an Accommodation Score for each of the Real Pairs and Constructed Pairs.",
        "In order to obtain a measure that can be used to compute accommodation for all the models considered, we compute the accommodation value as the fraction of turns in a session where partners exhibited the same speaking style.",
        "Results: In order to test our hypothesis we constructed an ANOVA model with Accommodation Score as the dependent variable and DirectInfluence, IndirectInfluence, RealVsConstructed as independent variables.",
        "Additionally we included the interaction terms between all pairs of inde",
        "models.",
        "Legend: ?=mean, ?",
        "= standard deviation, DI = ?Direct Influence?, II = ?Indirect Influence?.",
        "pendent variables.",
        "Using this ANOVA model, we find a highly significant main effect of the Re-alVsConstructed factor that demonstrates the general ability of the models to achieve separation between Real Pairs and Constructed Pairs; on average F(1,780) = 18.22, p < .0001.",
        "However, when we look more closely, we find that although the trend is consistently to find more evidence of speech style accommodation in Real Pairs than in Constructed Pairs, we see differentiation among the models in terms of their ability to achieve this separation.",
        "When we examine the two way interactions between DirectInfluence and RealVsConstructed as well as between IndirectInfluence and RealVsConstructed, although we do not find significant interactions, we do find some suggestive patterns when we do the student T posthoc analysis.",
        "In particular, when we explore just the interaction between IndirectInfluence links, we find a significant separation between Real vs Constructed pairs for models with Accommodation states, but not for the cases where no Accommodation states are included.",
        "However, when we do the same for the interaction between DirectInfluence links and RealVsCon-structed, we find significant separation with or without those links.",
        "This suggests that IndirectInfluence links are more important than DirectInfluence links.",
        "At a finer-grained level, when we examine the models individually, we only find a significant separation between Real and Constructed pairs with the model that includes both DirectInfluence and Symmetric IndirectInfluence links.",
        "These results suggest that Symmetric IndirectInfluence links may be slightly better than Asymmetric ones, and that combining DirectInfluence links and Symmetric IndirectInfluence links may be the best combination.",
        "Based on this analysis, we find support for our hypothesis.",
        "We find that the model that includes Symmetric IndirectInfluence links and DirectInfluence links is the best balance between representational power and simplicity.",
        "The support for the inclusion of DirectInfluence links in the model is weaker than that of IndirectInfluence links, however.",
        "On a larger dataset, we may have observed stronger effects of both factors.",
        "Even on this small dataset, we find evidence that adding that structure improves the performance of the model without leading to overfitting."

        "In this paper we presented an unsupervised dynamic Bayesian modeling approach to modeling speech style accommodation in face-to-face interactions.",
        "Our model was motivated by the idea that because accommodation reflects social processes that extend over time within an interaction, one may expect a certain consistency of motion within the stylistic shift.",
        "Our evaluation demonstrated a statistically significant advantage for the models that embodied this idea.",
        "An important motivation for our modeling approach was that it allows us to avoid targeting specific linguistic style features in our measure of accommodation.",
        "However, in our evaluation, we only tested our approach on conversations between male undergraduate students discussing the fall of the Ottoman Empire.",
        "Thus, while our evaluation provides evidence that we have taken a first important step towards our ultimate goal, we cannot yet claim that we have a model that performs equally effectively across contexts.",
        "In our future work, we plan to formally test the extent to which this allows us to accurately measure accommodation within contexts in which very different stylistic elements carry strategic social value.",
        "Another important direction of our current research is to explore how measures of speech style accommodation may predict other important measures such as how positively partners view one another, how successful partners perform tasks together, or how well students learn together."
