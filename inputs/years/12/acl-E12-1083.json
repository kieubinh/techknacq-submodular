        "The most straightforward approach to improve machine translation performance on patents is to enlarge the training set to include all available data.",
        "This question has been investigated by Tins-ley et al(2010) and Utiyama and Isahara (2007).",
        "A caveat in this situation is that data need to be from the general patent domain, as shown by the inferior performance of a large Europarl-trained model compared to a small patent-trained model.",
        "The goal of this paper is to analyze patent data along the topical dimension of IPC classes and along the structural dimension of textual sections.",
        "Instead of trying to beat a pooling baseline that simply increases the data size, our research goal is to investigate whether different subtasks along these dimensions share commonalities that can fruitfully be exploited by multi-task learning in machine translation.",
        "We thus aim to investigate the benefits of multi-task learning in realistic situations where a simple enlargement of training data is not possible.",
        "Starting from baseline models that are trained on individual tasks or on data pooled from all tasks, we apply mixtures of translation models and multi-task MERT tuning to multiple patent translation tasks.",
        "We find small, but statistically significant improvements for multi-task MERT tuning and parameter averaging techniques.",
        "Improvements are more pronounced for multi-task learning on textual domains than on IPC domains.",
        "This might indicate that the IPC sections are less well delimitated than the structural domains.",
        "Furthermore, this is owing to the limited expressiveness of a standard linear model including 14-20 features in tuning.",
        "The available features are very coarse and more likely to capture structural differences, such as sentence length, than the lexical differences that differentiate the semantic domains.",
        "We expect to see larger gains due to multi-task learning for discriminatively trained SMT models that involve very large numbers of features, especially when multi-task learning is done in a framework that combines parameter regularization with feature selection (Obozinski et al. 2010).",
        "In future work, we will explore a combination of large-scale discriminative training (Liang et al. 2006) with multi-task learning for SMT."
