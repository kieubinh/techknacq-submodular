        "Science is also hard to write, and finding fault with one's own writing is even more challenging since we understand ourselves perfectly, at least most of the time.",
        "To gain objectivity scientists turn away from silent readability indices and find more direct help in checklists such as the peer review form proposed by Bates College1, or scoring sheets to assess the quality of a scientific paper.",
        "These organise a systematic and critical walk through each part of a paper, from its title to its references in peer-review style.",
        "They integrate readability criteria that far exceed those covered by statistical lexical tools.",
        "For example, they examine how the text structure frames the contents under headings and subheadings that are consistent with the title and abstract of the paper.",
        "They test whether or not the writer fluidly meets the expectations of the reader.",

        "Rather than focusing on English grammar or spell-checking included in most modern word processors, SWAN gives feedback on the core elements of any scientific paper: title, abstract, introduction and conclusions.",
        "In addition, SWAN gives feedback on fluidity of writing and paper structure.",
        "SWAN includes two types of evaluation metrics, automatic and manual ones.",
        "Automatic metrics are solely implemented as text analysis of the original document using NLP tools.",
        "An example would be locating judgemental word patterns such as suffers from or locating sentences with passive voice.",
        "The manual metrics, in turn, require user's input for tasks that are difficult ?",
        "if not impossible ?",
        "to automate.",
        "An example would be highlighting title keywords that reflect the core contribution of the paper, or highlighting in the abstract the sentences that cover the relevant background.",
        "Many of the evaluation metrics are strongly interconnected with each other, such as ?",
        "Checking that abstract and title are consistent; for instance, frequently used abstract keywords should also be found in the title;",

        "An important part of paper quality metrics is assessing text fluidity.",
        "By fluidity we mean the ease with which the text can be read.",
        "This, in turn, depends on how much the reader needs to memorize about what they have read so far in order to understand new information.",
        "This memorizing need is greatly reduced if consecutive sentences do not contain rapid change in topic.",
        "The aim of the text fluidity module is to detect possible topic discontinuities within and across paragraphs, and to suggest ways of improving these parts, for example, by rearranging the sentences.",
        "The suggestions, while already useful, will improve in future versions of the tool with a better understanding of word meanings thanks to WordNet and lexical semantics techniques.",
        "Fluidity evaluation is difficult to fully automate.",
        "Manual fluidity evaluation relies on the reader's understanding of the text.",
        "It is therefore superior to the automatic evaluation which relies on a set of heuristics that endeavor to identify text fluidity based on the concepts of topic and stress developed in (Gopen, 2004).",
        "These heuristics require the analysis of the sentence for which the Stanford parser is used.",
        "These heuristics are perfectible, but they already allow the identification of sentences disrupting text fluidity.More fluidity problems would be revealed through the manual fluidity evaluation.",
        "Simply put, here topic refers to the main focus of the sentence (e.g. the subject of the main clause) while stress stands for the secondary sentence focus, which often becomes one of the following sentences?",
        "topic.",
        "SWAN compares the position of topic and stress across consecutive sentences, as well as their position inside the sentence (i.e. among its subclauses).",

        "4.",

        "The tool also alerts the writer when transition words such as in addition, on the other hand, or even the familiar however are used.",
        "Even though these expressions are effective when correctly used, they often betray the lack of a logical or semantic connection between consecutive sentences (?The cropping should preserve all critical points.",
