        "Speech has been the main mean of communication for thousands of years and, hence, is the most natural human interaction mode.",
        "For this reason, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has been one of the major research interests within the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community.",
        "Although current speech recognition approaches (which are based on statistical learning theory (Jelinek, 1998)) are speaker independent and achieve high accuracy, ASR systems are not perfect and transcription errors rise drastically when considering large vocabularies, dealing with noise environments or spontaneous speech.",
        "In those tasks (as for example, automatic transcription of parliaments proceedings) where perfect recognition results are required, ASR can not be fully reliable so far and, a human transcriber has to check and supervise the automatically generated transcriptions.",
        "In the last years, cooperative systems, where a human user and an automatic system work together, have gain growing attention.",
        "Here we present a system that interactively assists a human transcriber when using an ASR software.",
        "The proposed tool is fully embedded into a widely used and open source word processor and it relies on an ASR system that is proposing suggestions to the user in the form of practical transcriptions for the input speech.",
        "The user is allowed to introduce corrections at any moment of the discourse and, each time an amendment is performed, the system will take it into account in order to propose a new transcription (always preserving the decision made by the user, as can be seen in Fig. 1).",
        "The rationale behind this idea is to reduce the human user's effort and increase efficiency.",
        "Our proposal's main contribution is that it carries out an interactive ASR process, continually proposing new transcriptions that take into account user amendments to increase their usefulness.",
        "To our knowledge, no current transcription package provides such an interactive process."

      "heading": "2 Theoretical Background",
      "text": [
        "Computer Assisted Speech Recognition (CAST) can be addressed by extending the statistical approach to ASR.",
        "Specifically, we have an input signal to be transcribed x and the user feedback in the form of a fully correct transcription prefix p (an example of a CAST session is shown in Fig. 1).",
        "From this, the recognition system has to search for the optimal completion (suffix) s?",
        "as:",
        "where, as in traditional ASR, we have an acoustic model Pr(x |p, s) and a language model Pr(s |p).",
        "The main difference is that, here, part of the correct transcription is available (prefix) and we can use this information to improve the suffix recognition.",
        "This can be achieved by properly adapting the language model to account for the user validated prefix as it is detailed in (Rodr?",
        "?guez et al. 2007; Toselli et al. 2011).",
        "As was commented before, the main goal of this approach is to improve the efficiency of the transcription process by saving user keystrokes.",
        "Off-line experiments have shown that this approach can save about 30% of typing effort when compared to the traditional approach of off-line post-editing results from an ASR system."

        "As future work, it will be interesting to consider concurrent collaborative work at both, project and transcription levels.",
        "Other promising line is to consider a multimodal user interface in order to allow users to control the playback and transcription features using their own speech.",
        "This has been explored in the literature (Rodr?",
        "?guez et al. 2010) and would allow the system to be used in devices with constrained interfaces such as mobile phones or tablet PCs."
