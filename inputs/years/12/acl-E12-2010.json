        "One of the main problems for a spoken dialogue system (SDS) is to determine the user's goal (e.g. plan suitable meeting times or find a good Indian restaurant nearby) under uncertainty, and thereby to compute the optimal next system dialogue action (e.g. offer a restaurant, ask for clarification).",
        "Recent research in statistical SDSs has successfully addressed aspects of these problems through the application of Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) approaches (Thomson and Young, 2010; Young et al. 2010).",
        "However POMDP SDSs are currently limited by the representation of user goals adopted to make systems computationally tractable.",
        "Work in dialogue system evaluation, e.g. Walker et al(2004) and Lemon et al(2006), shows that real user goals are generally sets of items, rather than a single item.",
        "People like to explore possible trade offs between the attributes of items.",
        "Crook and Lemon (2010) identified this as a central challenge for the field of spoken dialogue systems, proposing the use of automatic compression techniques to allow for extended accurate representations of user goals.",
        "This paper presents a proof of concept of these ideas in the form of a complete, working spoken dialogue system.",
        "The POMDP dialogue manager (DM) of this demonstration system uses a compressed belief space that was generated using a modified version of the Value Directed Compression (VDC) algorithm as originally proposed by Poupart (2005).",
        "This demonstration system extends work presented by Crook and Lemon (2011) in that it embeds the compressed complex user goal belief space into a working system and demonstrates planning (and acting) in the compressed space."
