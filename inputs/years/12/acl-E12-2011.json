        "The work presented here is part of the pilot project EFNILEX 1 launched in 2008.",
        "The project objective was to investigate to what extent LT methods are capable of supporting the creation of bilingual dictionaries.",
        "Need for such dictionaries shows up specifically in the case of lesser used languages where it does not pay off for publishers to invest into the production of dictionaries due to the low demand.",
        "The targeted size of the dictionaries is between 15,000 and 25,000 entries.",
        "Since the 1EFNILEX is financed by EFNIL completely automatic generation of clean bilingual resources is not possible according to the state of the art, we have decided to provide lexicographers with bilingual resources that can facilitate their work.",
        "These kind of lexical resources will be referred to as proto-dictionaries henceforward.",
        "After investigating some alternative approaches e.g. hub-and-spoke model (Martin, 2007), alignment of WordNets, we have decided to use word alignment on parallel corpora.",
        "Former experiments (He?ja, 2010) have proven that word alignment is not only able to help the dictionary creation process itself, but the proposed technique also yields some definite advantages over more traditional approaches.",
        "The main motivation behind our choice was that the corpus-driven nature of the method decreases the reliance on human intuition during lexicographic work.",
        "Although the careful investigation of large monolingual corpora might have the same effect, being tedious and time-cosuming it is not affordable in the case of lesser used languages.",
        "In spite of the fact that word alignment has been widely used for more than a decade within the NLP community to produce bilingual lexicons e.g. Wu and Xia (1994) and several experts claimed that such resources might also be useful for lexicographic purposes e.g. Bertels et al.",
        "(2009), as far as we know, this technique has not been exploited in large-scale lexicographic projects yet e.g. Atkins and Rundell (2008).",
        "Earlier experiments has shown that although word alignment has definite advantages over more traditional approaches, there are also some difficulties that have to be dealt with: The method in itself does not handle multi-word expressions and",
        "the proto-dictionaries comprise incorrect translation candidates, as well.",
        "In fact, in a given parallel corpus the number of incorrect translation candidates strongly depends on the size of the proto-dictionary, as there is a trade-off between precision and recall.",
        "Accordingly, our objective is to design and implement a dictionary query system that is apt to exploit the benefits of the method and overcome the disadvantages of it.",
        "Hopefully, such a system renders the proto-dictionaries helpful for not only lexicographers, but also for ordinary dictionary users.",
        "In Section 2 the basic generation process is introduced along with the difficulties we have to deal with.",

        "The Dutch-French language pair represents well-resourced languages while the Hungarian-Lithuaninan language pair represents medium density languages.",
        "As for the former, we have exploited the French-Dutch parallel corpus which forms subpart of the Dutch Parallel Corpus (Macken et al. 2007).",
        "It consists of 3,606,000 French tokens, 3,215,000 Dutch tokens and 186,945 translation units2 (TUs).",
        "As for Hungarian and Lithuanian we have built a parallel corpus comprising 4,189,000 Hungarian and 3,544,000 Lithuanian tokens and 262,423 TUs.",
        "Because our original intention is to compile dictionaries covering everyday language, we have decided to focus on literature while collecting the texts.",
        "However, due to the scarce availability of parallel texts we made some concessions that might be questionable from a translation point of view.",
        "First, we did not confine ourselves purely 2The size of the parallel corpora is given in terms of translation units instead of in terms of sentence pairs, for many-to-many alignment was allowed, too.",
        "to the literary domain: The parallel corpus comprises also philosophical works.",
        "Secondly, instead of focusing on direct translations between Lithuanian and Hungarian we have relied mainly on translations from a third language.",

        "At this stage of the workflow some suitable heuristics need to be introduced to find the best translation candidates without the loss of too many correct pairs.",
        "Therefore, several evaluations were carried out.",
        "3The analysis of the Lithuanian texts was performed by the Lithuanian Centre of Computational Linguistics (Zinkevic?ius et al. 2005).",
        "The Hungarian texts were annotated with the tool-chain of the Research Institute for Linguistics, HAS (Oravecz and Dienes, 2002).",
        "It is important to note that throughout the manual evaluation we have focused on lexicographically useful translation candidates instead of perfect translations.",
        "The reason behind this is that translation synonymy is rare in general language e.g. Atkins and Rundell (2008, p. 467), thus other semantic relations, such as hyponymy or hyper-onymy, were also considered.",
        "Moreover, since the word alignment method does not handle MWEs in itself, partial matching between SL and TL translation candidates occurs frequently.",
        "In either case, provided example sentences make possible to find the right translation.",
        "We considered three parameters when searching for the best translations: translational probability, source language lemma frequency and target language lemma frequency (ptr, Fs and Ft, respectively).",
        "The lemma frequency had to be taken into account for at least two reasons.",
        "First, a minimal amount of data was necessary for the word alignment algorithm to be able to estimate the translational probability.",
        "Secondly, in the case of rarely used TL lemmas the alignment algorithm might assign high translational probabilities to incorrect lemma pairs if the source lemma occurs frequently in the corpus and both members of the lemma pair recurrently show up in aligned units.",
        "Results of the first evaluation showed that translation pairs with relatively low frequency and with a relatively high translational probability yielded cc.",
        "85% lexicographically useful translation pairs.",
        "Although the precision was rather convincing, it has also turned out that the size of the resulting proto-dictionaries might be a serious bottleneck of the method (He?ja, 2010).",
        "Whereas the targeted size of the dictionaries is between 15,000 and 25,000 entries, the proto-dictionaries comprised only 5,521 Hungarian-Lithuanian and 7,007 French-Dutch translation candidates with the predefined parameters.",
        "Accordingly, the coverage of the proto-dictionaries should be augmented.",
        "According to our hypothesis in the case of more frequent source lemmata even lower values of translation probability might yield the same result in terms of precision as in the case of lower frequency source lemmata.",

        "800 translation candidates were evaluated altogether, 200 from each evaluation domain.",

        "Lithuanian proto-dictionary.",
        "However, we should keep in mind when searching for the optimal values for these parameters that while we aim at including as many translation candidates as possible, we also expect the generated resource to be as clean as possible.",
        "That is, in the case of proto-dictionaries there is a trade-off between precision and recall: the size of the resulting proto-dictionaries can be increased only at the cost of more incorrect translation candidates.",
        "This leads us to the question of what parameter settings are useful for what usage scenarios?",
        "We think that the proto-dictionaries generated by this method with various settings match well different user needs.",
        "For instance, when the settings are strict so that the minimal frequencies and probabilities are set high, the dictionary will contain less translation pairs, resulting in high precision and relatively low coverage, with only the most frequently used words and their most frequent translations.",
        "Such a dictionary is especially useful for a novice language learner.",
        "Professional translators are able to judge whether a translation is correct or not.",
        "They might be rather interested in special uses of words, lexicographically useful but not perfect translation candidates, and more subtle cross-language semantic relations, while at the same time, looking at the concordance provided along with the translation pairs, they can easily catch wrong translations which are the side-effect of the method.",
        "This kind of work may be supported by a proto-dictionary with increased recall even at the cost of a lower precision.",
