        "Named Entity Extraction is a mature task in the NLP field that has yielded numerous services gaining popularity in the Semantic Web community for extracting knowledge from web documents.",
        "These services are generally organized as pipelines, using dedicated APIs and different taxonomy for extracting, classifying and disambiguating named entities.",
        "Integrating one of these services in a particular application requires to implement an appropriate driver.",
        "Furthermore, the results of these services are not comparable due to different formats.",
        "This prevents the comparison of the performance of these services as well as their possible combination.",
        "We address this problem by proposing NERD, a framework which unifies 10 popular named entity extractors available on the web, and the NERD ontology which provides a rich set of axioms aligning the taxonomies of these tools."

        "The web hosts millions of unstructured data such as scientific papers, news articles as well as forum and archived mailing list threads or (micro-)blog posts.",
        "This information has usually a rich semantic structure which is clear for the human being but that remains mostly hidden to computing machinery.",
        "Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools aim to extract such a structure from those free texts.",
        "They provide algorithms for analyz-ing atomic information elements which occur in a sentence and identify Named Entity (NE) such as name of people or organizations, locations, time references or quantities.",
        "They also classify these entities according to predefined schema increasing discoverability (e.g. through faceted search) and reusability of information.",
        "Recently, research and commercial communities have spent efforts to publish NLP services on the web.",
        "Beside the common task of identifying POS and of reducing this set to NEs, they provide more and more disambiguation facility with URIs that describe web resources, leveraging on the web of real world objects.",
        "Moreover, these services classify such information using common ontologies (e.g. DBpedia ontology1 or YAGO2) exploiting the large amount of knowledge available from the web of data.",
        "Tools such as Alche",
        "sent a clear opportunity for the web community to increase the volume of interconnected data.",
        "Although these extractors share the same purpose - extract NE from text, classify and disambiguate this information - they make use of different algorithms and provide different outputs.",

        "tors publicly available on the web.",
        "Our approach relies on the development of the NERD ontology which provides a common interface for annotating elements, and a web REST API which is used to access the unified output of these tools.",

        "At the end of the evaluation, the user sends the results, through asynchronous calls, to the REST API engine in order to store them.",
