        "We present a web tool that allows users to explore news stories concerning the 2012 US Presidential Elections via an interactive interface.",
        "The tool is based on concepts of ?narrative analysis?, where the key actors of a narration are identified, along with their relations, in what are sometimes called ?semantic triplets?",
        "(one example of a triplet of this kind is ?Romney Criticised Obama?).",
        "The network of actors and their relations can be mined for insights about the structure of the narration, including the identification of the key players, of the network of political support of each of them, a representation of the similarity of their political positions, and other information concerning their role in the media narration of events.",
        "The interactive interface allows the users to retrieve news report supporting the relations of interest."

        "U.S presidential elections are major media events, following a fixed calendar, where two or more public relation ?machines?",
        "compete to send out their message.",
        "From the point of view of the media, this event is often framed as a race, with contenders, front runners, and complex alliances.",
        "By the end of the campaign, which lasts for about one year, two line-ups are created in the media, one for each major party.",
        "This event provides researchers an opportunity to analyse the narrative structures found in the news coverage, the amounts of media attention that is devoted to the main contenders and their allies, and other patterns of interest.",
        "We propose to study the U.S Presidential Elections with the tools of (quantitative) narrative analysis, identifying the key actors and their political relations, and using this information to infer the overall structure of the political coalitions.",
        "We are also interested in how the media covers such event that is which role is attributed to each actor within this narration.",
        "Quantitative Narrative Analysis (QNA) is an approach to the analysis of news content that requires the identification of the key actors, and of the kind of interactions they have with each other (Franzosi, 2010).",
        "It usually requires a significant amount of manual labour, for ?coding?",
        "the news articles, and this limits the analysis to small samples.",
        "We claim that the most interesting relations come from analysing large networks resulting from tens of thousands of articles, and therefore that QNA needs to be automated.",
        "Our approach is to use a parser to extract simple SVO triplets, forming a semantic graph to identify the noun phrases with actors, and to classify the verbal links between actors in three simple categories: those expressing political support, those expressing political opposition, and the rest.",
        "By identifying the most important actors and triplets, we form a large weighted and directed network which we analyse for various types of patterns.",
        "In this paper we demonstrate an automated system that can identify articles relative to the 2012 US Presidential Election, from 719 online news outlets, and can extract information about the key players, their relations, and the role they play in the electoral narrative.",
        "The system refreshes its information every 24 hours, and has already analysed tens of thousands of news articles.",
        "The tool allows the user to browse the growing set of news articles by the relations between actors, for example retrieving all articles where Mitt Romney",
        "praises Obama1.",
        "A set of interactive plots allows users to explore the news data by following specific candidates and also specific types of relations, to see a spectrum of all key actors sorted by their political affinity, a network representing relations of political support between actors, and a two-dimensional space where proximity again represents political affinity, but also they can access information about the role mostly played by a given actor in the media narrative: that of a subject or that of an object.",
        "The ElectionWatch system is built on top of our infrastructure for news content analysis, which has been described elsewhere.",
        "It has also access to named entities information, with which it can generate timelines and activity-maps.",
        "These are also available through the web interface."

        "We trained and validated our classifier using the specialised Election news feed from Yahoo!.",
        "The performance of the classifier reached 83.46% precision, 73.29% recall, validated on unseen articles.",

        "Accuse(V)?Republicans(O)?.",
        "We found that news media contains less than 5% of passive sentences and therefore it is ignored.",
        "We store each triplet in a database annotated with a reference to the article from which it was extracted.",
        "This allows us to track the background information of each triplet in the database.",
        "Key Actors.",
        "From triplets extracted, we make a list of actors which are defined as subjects and objects of triplets.",
        "We rank actors according to their frequencies and consider the top 50 subjects and objects as the key actors.",
        "Polarity of Actions.",
        "The verb element in triplets are defined as actions.",
        "We map actions to two specific action types which are endorsement and opposing.",
        "We obtained the endorsement/opposing polarity of verbs using the Verbnet data (Kipper et al2006)).",
        "Extraction of Relations.",
        "We retain all triplets that have a) the key actors as subjects or objects; and b) an endorse/oppose verb.",
        "To extract relations we introduced a weighting scheme.",
        "Each endorsement-relation between actors a, b is weighted by wa,b:",
        "where fa,b(+) denotes the number of triplets between a, b with positive relation and fa,b(?)",

        "Network Partitioning.",
        "By using graph partitioning methods we can analyse the allegiance of actors to a party, and therefore their role in the political discourse.",
        "The Endorsement Network is a directed graph.",
        "To perform its partitioning we first omit directionality by calculating graph B = A+AT , where A is the adjacency matrix of the Endorsement Network.",
        "We computed eigenvectors of the B and selected the eigenvector that",
        "ments of the eigenvector represent actors.",
        "We sort them by their magnitude and we obtain a sorted list of actors.",
        "In the website we display only actors that are very polarised politically in the sides of the list.",
        "These two sets of actors correlate well with the left-right political ordering in our experiments on past US Elections.",
        "Since in the first phase of the campaign there are more than two sides, we added a scatter plot using the first two eigenvectors.",

        "We agree on the fact that the triplets extracted by the system are not very clean.",

        "We have tested this system on data from all previous six elections, using the New York Times corpus as well as our own database.",
        "We use only support/criticism relations revealing a strong polarisation among actors and this seems to correspond to the left/right political dimension.",
        "Evaluation is an issue due to lack of data but results on the past six election cycles on New York Times always seperated the two competing candidates along the eigenvector spectrum.",
        "This is not so easy in the primary part of the elections, when multiple candidates compete with each other for the role of contender.",
        "To cover this case, we generate also a two-dimensional plot using the first two eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix, which seems to capture the main groupings in the political narrative.",
        "Future work will include making better use of the information coming from the parser, which",
        "goes well beyond the simple SVO structure of sentences, and developing more sophisticated methods for the analysis of large and complex networks that can be inferred with the methodology we have developed."
