        "Machine Translation is a well?established field, yet the majority of current systems translate sentences in isolation, losing valuable contextual information from previously translated sentences in the discourse.",
        "One important type of contextual information concerns who or what a coreferring pronoun corefers to (i.e., its antecedent).",
        "Languages differ significantly in how they achieve coreference, and awareness of antecedents is important in choosing the correct pronoun.",
        "Disregarding a pronoun's antecedent in translation can lead to inappropriate coreferring forms in the target text, seriously degrading a reader's ability to understand it.",
        "This work assesses the extent to which source-language annotation of coreferring pronouns can improve English?Czech Statistical Machine Translation (SMT).",
        "As with previous attempts that use this method, the results show little improvement.",

        "It is well-known that in many natural languages, a pronoun that corefers must bear similar features to its antecedent.",
        "These can include similar number, gender (morphological or referential), and/or animacy.",
        "If a pronoun and its antecedent occur in the same unit of translation (N-gram or syntactic tree), these agreement features can influence the translation.",
        "But this locality cannot be guaranteed in either phrase-based or syntax-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT).",
        "If it is not within the same unit, a coreferring pronoun will be translated without knowledge of its antecedent, meaning that its translation will simply reflect local frequency.",
        "Incorrectly translating a pronoun can result in readers/listeners identifying the wrong antecedent, which can mislead or confuse them.",
        "There have been two recent attempts to solve this problem within the framework of phrase-based SMT (Hardmeier & Federico, 2010; Le Nagard & Koehn, 2010).",
        "Both involve annotation projection, which in this context means annotating coreferential pronouns in the source-language with features derived from the translation of their aligned antecedents, and then building a translation model of the annotated forms.",
        "When translating a coreferring pronoun in a new source-language text, the antecedent is identified and its translation used (differently in the two attempts cited above) to annotate the pronoun prior to translation.",
        "The aim of this work was to better understand why neither of the previous attempts achieved more than a small improvement in translation quality associated with coreferring pronouns.",
        "Only by understanding this will it be possible to ascertain whether the method of annotation projection is intrinsically flawed or the unexpectedly small improvement is due to other factors.",

        "Aligning the source and target texts at the phrase and word levels.",
        "Factoring out the first two decisions would show whether the lack of significant improvement was simply due to imperfect coreference resolution.",
        "In order to control for these errors several different manually annotated versions of the Penn Wall Street Journal corpus were used, each providing different annotations over the same text.",
        "The BBN Pronoun Coreference and Entity Type corpus (Weischedel & Brunstein, 2005) was used to provide coreference information in the source-language and exclude non-referential pronouns.",
        "It also formed the source-language side of the parallel training corpus.",
        "The PCEDT 2.0 corpus (Hajic?",
        "et al 2011), which contains a close Czech translation of the Penn Wall Street Journal corpus, provided reference translations for testing and the target-language side of the parallel corpus for training.",
        "To minimise (although not completely eliminate) errors associated with antecedent head identification (item 3 above), the parse trees in the Penn Treebank 3.0 corpus (Marcus et al. 1999) were used.",
        "The gold standard annotation provided by these corpora allowed me to assume perfect identification of coreferring pronouns and coreference resolution and near?perfect antecedent head noun identification.",

        "through the use of manually annotated corpora, the results of the Annotated system show only a small improvement over the Baseline system.",
        "Two possible reasons for this are that the statistics in the phrase translation table have been weakened in the Annotated system as a result of including both number and gender in the annotation and that the size of the training corpus is relatively small.",
        "However, more significant may be the availability of only a single reference translation.",
        "This affects the development and application of automated evaluation metrics as a single reference cannot capture the variety of possible valid translations.",
        "Coreference can be achieved without explicit pronouns.",
        "This is true of both English and Czech, with sentences that contain pronouns having common paraphrases that lack them.",
        "For example, the u.s. , claiming some success in its trade diplomacy , ... can be paraphrased as: the u.s. , claiming some success in trade diplomacy , ... A target-language translation of the former might actually be a translation of the latter, and hence lack the pronoun shown in bold.",
        "Given the range of variability in whether pronouns are used in conveying coreference, the availability of only a single reference translation is a real problem.",

        "This requires identification of features in the target side, their extraction and incorporation in the translation process which could be difficult to achieve within a purely statistical framework given that the antecedent of a pronoun may be arbitrarily distant in the previous discourse.",
        "The aim of this work was to better understand why previous attempts at using annotation projection in pronoun translation showed less than expected improvement.",
        "Thus it would be beneficial to conduct an error analysis to show the frequency of the errors described in Section 5.3 appear.",
        "I will also be exploring other directions related to problems identified during the course of the work completed to date.",
        "These include, but are not limited to, handling pronoun dropping in pro-drop languages, developing pronoun-specific automated evaluation metrics and addressing the problem of having only one reference translation for use with such metrics.",
        "In this regard, I will be considering the use of paraphrase techniques to generate synthetic reference translations to augment an existing reference translation set.",
        "Initial efforts will focus on adapting the approach of Kauchak & Barzilay (2006) and back?translation methods for extracting paraphrases (Bannard & Callison-Burch, 2005) to the more specific problem of pronoun variation."
