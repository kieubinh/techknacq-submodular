        "Cue phrases have received extensive attention in the computational linguistics literature.",
        "Early work by Cohen (1984) presents a computational justification for the importance of cue phrases in discourse processing.",
        "Using a simple propositional framework for analyzing discourse, Cohen claims that, in some cases, cue phrases decrease the number of operations required by the listener to process ?coherent transmissions?",
        "; in other cases, cue phrases are necessary to allow the recognition of ?transmissions which would be incoherent (too complex to reconstruct) in the absence of clues?",
        "(page 251).",
        "Reichman (1985) proposes a model of discourse structure in which discourse comprises a collection of basic constituents called context spaces, organized hierarchically according to semantic and logical relations called conversational moves.",
        "In Reichman's model, cue phrases are portrayed as mechanisms that signal context space boundaries, specifying the kind of conversational move about to take place.",
        "Grosz and Sidner (1986) introduce an alternative model of discourse structure formed by three interrelated",
        "Gravano, Hirschberg, and Ben?u?",
        "Affirmative Cue Words in Task-Oriented Dialogue components: a linguistic structure, an intentional structure, and an attentional state.",
        "In this model, cue phrases play a central role, allowing the speaker to provide information about all of the following to the listener: 1) that a change of attention is imminent; 2) whether the change returns to a previous focus space or creates a new one; 3) how the intention is related to other intentions; 4) what precedence relationships, if any, are relevant (page 196).",
        "In a corpus study of spontaneous conversations, Schiffrin (1987) describes cue phrases as syntactically detachable from a sentence, commonly used in initial position within utterances, capable of operating at both local and global levels of discourse, and having a range of prosodic contours.",
        "As other authors, Schiffrin observes that cue phrases provide contextual coordinates for an utterance in the discourse?that is, they indicate the discourse segment to which an utterance belongs.",
        "However, she suggests that cue phrases only display discourse structure relations; they do not create them.",
        "In a critique of Schiffrin's work, Redeker (1991) proposes defining cue phrases as phrases ?uttered with the primary function of bringing to the listener's attention a particular kind of linkage of the upcoming utterance with the immediate discourse context?",
        "(page 1169).",
        "Prior work on the automatic classification of cue phrases includes a series of studies performed by Hirschberg and Litman (Hirschberg and Litman 1987, 1993; Litman and Hirschberg 1990), which focus on differentiating between the discourse and sentential senses of single-word cue phrases such as now, well, okay, say, and so in American English.",
        "When used in a discourse sense, a cue phrase explicitly conveys information about the discourse structure; when used in a sentential sense, a cue phrase instead conveys semantic information.",
        "Hirschberg and Litman present two manually developed classification models, one based on prosodic features, and one based on textual features.",
        "This line of research is further pursued by Litman (1994, 1996), who incorporates machine learning techniques to derive classification models automatically.",
        "Litman uses different combinations of prosodic and text-based features to train decision-tree and rule learners, and shows that machine learning constitutes a powerful tool for developing automatic classifiers of cue phrases into their sentential and discourse uses.",
        "Zufferey and Popescu-Belis (2004) present a similar study on the automatic classification of like and well into discourse and sentential senses, achieving a performance close to that of human annotators.",
        "Besides the binary division of cue phrases into discourse vs. sentential meanings, the Conversational Analysis (CA) literature describes items it terms linguistic feedback or acknowledgments.",
        "These include not only the computational linguists?",
        "cue phrases but also expressions such as I see or oh wow, which CA research describes in terms of attention, understanding, and acceptance by the speaker of a proposition uttered by another conversation participant (Kendon 1967; Yngve 1970; Duncan 1972; Schegloff 1982; Jefferson 1984).",
        "Such items typically occur at the second position in common adjacency pairs and include backchannels (also referred to as continuers), which ?exhibit on the part of [their] producer an understanding that an extended unit of talk is underway by another, and that it is not yet, or may not be (even ought not yet be) complete; [they take] the stance that the speaker of that extended unit should continue talking?",
        "(Schegloff 1982, page 81), and agreements, which indicate the speaker's agreement with a statement or opinion expressed by another speaker.",
        "Allwood, Nivre, and Ahlsen (1992) distinguish four basic communicative functions of linguistic feedback which enable conversational partners to exchange information: contact, perception, understanding, and attitudinal reactions.",
        "These correspond respectively",
        " to whether the interlocutor is willing and able to continue the interaction, perceive the message, understand the message, and react and respond to the message.",
        "Allwood, Nivre, and Ahlsen posit that ?simple feedback words, like yes, [...] involve a high degree of context dependence?",
        "(page 5), and suggest that their basic communicative function strongly depends on the type of speech act, factual polarity, and information status of the immediately preceding communicative act.",
        "Novick and Sutton (1994) propose an alternative categorization of linguistic feedback in task-oriented dialogue, which is based on the structural context of exchanges rather than on the characteristics of the preceding utterance.",
        "The three main classes in Novick and Sutton's catalogue are: (i) other ?",
        "ackn, where an acknowledgment immediately follows a contribution by other speaker; (ii) self ?",
        "other ?",
        "ackn, where self initiates an exchange, other eventually completes it, and self utters an acknowledgment; and (iii) self + ackn, where self includes an acknowledgment in an utterance independently of other's previous contribution.",
        "Substantial attention has been paid to subsets and supersets of words we include in our class of ACWs in the psycholinguistic literature in studies of grounding?",
        "the process by which conversants obtain and maintain a common ground of mutual knowledge, mutual beliefs, and mutual assumptions over the course of a conversation (Clark and Schaefer 1989; Clark and Brennan 1991).",
        "Computational work on grounding has been pursued for a number of years by Traum and colleagues (e.g., Traum and Allen 1992; Traum 1994), who recently have described a corpus-based study of lexical and semantic evidence supporting different degrees of grounding (Roque and Traum 2009).",
        "Our ACWs often occur in the process of establishing such common ground.",
        "Prosodic characteristics of the responses involved in grounding have been studied in the Australian English Map Task corpus by Mushin et al. (2003), who find that these utterances often consist of acknowledgment contributions such as okay or yeh produced with a ?non-final?",
        "intonational contour, and followed by speech by the same speaker which appears to continue the intonational phrase.",
        "Studies by Walker of informationally redundant utterances (IRUs) (Walker 1992, 1996), utterances which express ?a proposition already entailed, presupposed or implicated by a previous utterance in the same discourse situation?",
        "(Walker 1993a, page 12), also include some of our ACWs, such as IRU prompts (e.g., uh-huh), which, according to Walker, ?add no new propositional content to the common ground?",
        "(Walker 1993a, page 32).",
        "Walker adopts the term ?continuer?",
        "from the Conversational Analysis school to further describe these prompts (Walker 1993a).",
        "Walker describes some intonational contours which are used to realize IRUs in generation in Walker (1993a) and in Walker (1993b), examining 63 IRU tokens and finding five different types of contour used among them.",
        "As part of a larger project on automatically detecting discourse structure for speech recognition and understanding tasks in American English, Jurafsky et al. (1998) present a study of four particular discourse/pragmatic functions, or dialog acts (Bunt 1989; Core and Allen 1997), closely related to ACWs: backchannel, agreement, incipient speakership (indicating an intention to take the floor), and yes-answer (affirmative answer to a yes?no question).",
        "The authors examine 1,155 conversations from the Switchboard database (Godfrey, Holliman, and McDaniel 1992), and report that the vast majority of these four dialogue acts are realized with words like yeah, okay, or uh-huh.",
        "They find that the lexical realization of the dialogue act is the strongest cue to its identity (e.g., backchannel is the preferred function for uh-huh and mm-hm), and report preliminary results on some prosodic differences across dialogue acts: Backchannels are shorter in duration, have lower pitch and intensity, and are more likely to end in a rising intonation than agreements.",
        "Two related studies, part of the same project, address the automatic classification of dialogue acts in conversational speech (Shriberg et al. 1998; Stolcke",
        "Gravano, Hirschberg, and Ben?u?",
        "Affirmative Cue Words in Task-Oriented Dialogue et al. 2000).",
        "The results of their machine learning experiments, conducted on the same subset of Switchboard used previously, indicate a high degree of confusion between agreements and backchannels, because both classes share words such as yeah and right.",
        "They also show that prosodic features (including duration, pause, and intensity) can aid the automatic disambiguation between these two classes: A classifier trained using both lexical and prosodic features slightly yet significantly outperforms one trained using just lexical features.",
        "There is also considerable evidence that linguistic feedback does not take place at arbitrary locations in conversation; rather, it mostly occurs at or near transition-relevance places for turn-taking (Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson 1974; Goodwin 1981).",
        "Ward and Tsukahara (2000) describe, in both Japanese and American English, a region of low pitch lasting at least 110 msec which may function as a prosodic cue inviting the realization of a backchannel response from the interlocutor.",
        "In a corpus study of Japanese dialogues, Koiso et al. (1998) find that both syntax and prosody play a central role in predicting the occurrence of backchannels.",
        "Cathcart, Carletta, and Klein (2003) propose a method for automatically predicting the placement of backchannels in Scottish English conversation, based on pause durations and part-of-speech tags, that outperforms a random baseline model.",
        "Recently, Gravano and Hirschberg (2009a, 2009b, 2011) describe six distinct prosodic, acoustic, and lexical events in American English speech that tend to precede the occurrence of a backchannel by the interlocutor.",
        "Despite their high frequency in spontaneous conversation, the set of ACWs we examine here have seldom, if ever, been an object of study in themselves, as a separate subclass of cue phrases or dialogue acts.",
        "Some have attempted to model other types of cue phrases (e.g., well, like) or cue phrases in general; others discuss discourse/ pragmatic functions that may be conveyed through ACWs, but which may also be conveyed through other types of expressions (e.g., agreements may be communicated by single words such as yes or longer cue phrases such as that's correct).",
        "Subsets of ACWs have been studied in very small corpora, with some proposals about their prosodic and functional variations.",
        "For example, Hockey (1993) examines the prosodic variation of two ACWs, okay and uh-huh (66 and 77 data points, respectively) produced as full intonational phrases in two spontaneous task-oriented dialogues.",
        "She groups the F0 contours visually and auditorily, and shows that instances of okay produced with a high-rise contour are significantly more likely to be followed by speech from the other speaker than from the same speaker.",
        "The results of a perception experiment conducted by Gravano et al. (2007) suggest that, in task-oriented American English dialogue, contextual information (e.g., duration of surrounding silence, number of surrounding words) as well as word-final intonation figure as the most salient cues to disambiguation of the function of the word okay by human listeners.",
        "Also, in a study of the function of intonation in Scottish English task-oriented dialogue, Kowtko (1996) examines a corpus of 273 instances of single-word utterances, including affirmative cue words such as mm-hm, okay, right, uh-huh, and yes.",
        "Kowtko finds a significant correlation between discourse function and intonational contour: The align function (which checks that the listener's understanding aligns with that of the speaker) is shown to correlate with rising intonational contours; the ready function (which cues the speaker's intention to begin a new task) and the reply-y function (which ?has an affirmative surface and usually indicates agreement?",
        "; Kowtko 1996, page 59) correlate with a non-rising intonation; and the acknowledge function (which indicates having heard and understood) presents all types of final intonation.",
        "It is important to note, however, that different dialects and different languages have distinct ways of realizing different discourse/pragmatic functions, so it is unclear how useful these results are for American English.",
        " Although broader studies focusing on the pragmatic function of cue phrases, discourse markers, linguistic feedback, and dialogue acts do shed light on the particular subset of utterances we are studying, and although there is some information on particular lexical items we include here in our study, the class of ACWs itself has received little attention.",
        "Particularly given the frequency of ACWs in dialogue, it is important to identify reliable and automatically extractable cues to their disambiguation, so that spoken dialogue systems can recognize the pragmatic function of ACWs in user input and can produce ACWs that are less likely to be misinterpreted in system output."

        "In this work we have undertaken a comprehensive study of affirmative cue words, a subset of cue phrases such as okay, yeah, or alright that may be utilized to convey as many as ten different discourse/pragmatic functions, such as indicating continued attention to the interlocutor or cueing the beginning of a new topic.",
        "Considering the high frequency of ACWs in task-oriented dialogue, it is critical for some spoken language processing applications such as spoken dialogue systems to model the usage of these words correctly, from both an understanding and a generation perspective.",
        "Section 4 presents statistical evidence of a number of differences in the production of the various discourse/pragmatic functions of ACWs.",
        "The most notable contrasts in acoustic/prosodic features relate to word final intonation and word intensity.",
        "Backchannels typically end in a rising intonation; agreements and cue beginnings, in a falling intonation.",
        "Cue beginnings tend to be produced with a high intensity, and cue endings with a very low one.",
        "Other acoustic/prosodic features?duration, mean pitch, and voice quality?also seem to vary with the word usage.",
        "Our findings related to final intonation are consistent with previous results obtained by Hockey (1993) and Jurafsky et al. (1998) for American English.",
        "For Scottish English, Kowtko (1996) reports a non-rising intonation for cue beginnings and for her ?reply-y?",

        "Kowtko also reports observing all types of final intonation in her ?acknowledge?",
        "function, whose definition overlaps both our agreements and backchannels.",
        "Thus, we find no apparent contradictions between Kowtko's results for Scottish English and ours for American English.",
        "The word okay is the most heavily overloaded ACW in our corpus.",
        "Our corpus includes instances conveying each of the ten identified meanings, and this item shows the highest degree of variation along the acoustic/prosodic features we have examined.",
        "Gravano, Hirschberg, and Ben?u?",
        "Affirmative Cue Words in Task-Oriented Dialogue We speculate from this finding that the more ambiguous an ACW, the more a speaker needs to vary acoustic/prosodic features to differentiate its meaning.",
        "Our statistical analysis of ACWs also shows that these words display substantial positional differences across functions, such as the position of the word in its conversational turn, or whether the word is preceded and/or followed by silence.",
        "Such large differences bring support to Novick and Sutton's (1994) claim that the discourse/ pragmatic role of these expressions strongly depends on their basic structural context.",
        "For example, in Novick and Sutton's words, an ACW in turn-initial position is ?clearly not serving as a prompt for the other speaker to continue?",
        "(page 97).",
        "Previous studies on the automatic disambiguation of other types of cue words, such as now, well, or like, present the problem as a binary classification task: Each cue word has either a discourse or a sentential sense (e.g., Litman 1996; Zufferey and Popescu-Belis 2004).",
        "In the study of automatic classification of ACWs presented in Section 5 we show that for spoken task-oriented dialogue, the simple discourse/sentential distinction is insufficient.",
        "In consequence, we define two new classification tasks besides the general task of classifying any ACW into any function.",
        "Our first task, the detection of an acknowledgment function, has important implications for the language management component in spoken dialogue systems, which must keep track of which material has reached mutual belief in a conversation (Bunt, Morante, and Keizer 2007; Roque and Traum 2009).",
        "Our second task, the detection of a discourse segment boundary function, should help in discourse segmentation and meeting processing tasks (Litman and Passonneau 1995).",
        "Our SVM models based on lexical, discourse, timing, and acoustic features approach the error rate of trained human labelers in all tasks, while our automatically computed phonetic features offer no improvement.",
        "Previous studies indicate that the pragmatic function of ambiguous expressions may be effectively predicted by models that combine information extracted from various sources, including lexical and prosodic (e.g., Litman 1996; Stolcke et al. 2000).",
        "Our results support this, and extend the list of useful information sources to include discourse and timing features that may be easily extracted from the time-aligned transcripts.",
        "Additionally, our machine learning study includes experiments with several combinations of feature sets, in an attempt to simulate the conditions of different applications.",
        "Models that are trained using features extracted only from the speech signal up to the IPU containing the target word simulate on-line applications such as spoken dialogue systems with access to acoustic/prosodic features.",
        "Although such models perform worse than ?off-line?",
        "models, which make use of left and right context, they still significantly outperform our baseline classifiers.",
        "Models that simulate the conditions of current spoken dialogue systems with access only to lexical features (although perhaps errorful) and TTS systems synthesizing spoken conversations, which have access only to features extracted from the input text, also significantly outperform our baseline classifiers.",
        "Interactions between state-of-the-art spoken dialogue systems and their users appear to contain very few instances of backchannel responses from either conversational partner.",
        "On the system's side, the absence of this important element of spoken communication may be due to the difficulty of detecting appropriate moments where a backchannel response would be welcome by the user.",
        "Recent advances on that research topic (Ward and Tsukahara 2000; Cathcart, Carletta, and Klein 2003; Gravano and Hirschberg 2009a) have encouraged research on ways to equip systems with the ability to signal to the user that the system is still listening (Maatman, Gratch, and Marsella 2005; Bevacqua, Mancini, and Pelachaud 2008; Morency, de Kok, and Gratch 2008)?",
        "for example, when the user is asked to enter large amounts of information.",
        "On the",
        " user's side, an important reason for not backchanneling may lie in the unnaturalness of such systems, often described as ?confusing?",
        "or even ?intimidating?",
        "by users, as well as their inability to recognize backchannels as such.",
        "Nonetheless, recent Wizard-of-Oz experiments conducted by Hjalmarsson (2009, 2011) show that humans appear to react to turn-management cues produced by a synthetic voice in the same way that they react to cues produced by another human.",
        "This important finding suggests that users of spoken dialogue systems could be cued to produce backchannel responses, for example to determine if they are still paying attention.",
        "In that case, it will be crucial for systems to be able to distinguish backchannels from other pragmatic functions (Shriberg et al. 1998).",
        "In Section 5.5 we present results on the task of automatically identifying backchannel ACWs from the other possible functions.",
        "Our models improve over the baseline in an off-line condition (e.g., for meeting processing tasks), but fail to do so in an on-line setting (e.g., for spoken dialogue systems).",
        "Practically all of the confusion of this on-line model comes from misclassifying agreements (Agr) as backchannels (BC) and vice versa.",
        "The reliability of our human labelers for distinguishing these two classes was measured by Fleiss's ?",
        "at 0.570, a level considerably lower than the 0.745 achieved for the general labeling task, which indicates that the backchannel identification task is difficult for humans as well, at least when they are not engaged in the conversation itself but only listening to it after the fact.",
        "Although we asked our annotators to distinguish the agreement function of ACWs from ?continued attention,?",
        "there are clearly cases where people disagree about whether speakers are indicating agreement or not.",
        "In future research we will investigate this issue in more detail, given the relevance of on-line identification of backchannels in spoken dialogue systems.",
        "In summary, in this study we have identified a number of characterizations of affirmative cue words in a large corpus of SAE task-oriented dialogue.",
        "The corpus on which our experiments were conducted, rich in ACWs conveying a wide range of discourse/pragmatic functions, has allowed us to systematically investigate many dimensions of these words, including their production and automatic disambiguation.",
        "Besides the value of our findings from a linguistic modeling perspective, we believe that incorporating these results into the production and understanding components of spoken dialogue systems should improve their performance and increase user satisfaction levels accordingly, getting us one step closer to the long-term goal of effectively emulating human behavior in dialogue systems.",
