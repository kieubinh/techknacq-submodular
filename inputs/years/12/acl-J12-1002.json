        "This article presents the thesis that defining meaning as context leads naturally to a model in which meanings of strings are represented as elements of an associative algebra over the real numbers, and entailment is described by a vector lattice ordering.",
        "This model is general enough to encompass several proposed methods of composition in vector-based representations of meaning.",
        "In recent years, the abundance of text corpora and computing power has allowed the development of techniques to analyze statistical properties of words.",
        "For example techniques such as latent semantic analysis (Deerwester et al. 1990) and its variants, and measures of distributional similarity (Lin 1998; Lee 1999), attempt to derive aspects of the meanings of words by statistical analysis, and statistical information is often used when parsing to determine sentence structure (Collins 1997).",
        "These techniques have proved useful in many applications within computational linguistics and natural language processing (Grefenstette 1994; Schu?tze 1998; Bellegarda 2000; Choi, Wiemer-Hastings, and Moore 2001; Lin 2003; McCarthy et al. 2004), arguably providing evidence that they capture something about the nature of words that should be included in representations of their meaning.",
        "However, it is very difficult to reconcile these techniques with existing theories of meaning in language, which revolve around logical and ontological representations.",
        "The new techniques, almost without exception, can be viewed as dealing with vector-based representations of meaning, placing meaning (at least at the word level) within the realm of mathematics and algebra; conversely the older theories of meaning dwell in the realm of logic and ontology.",

        "The problem appears to be a fundamental one in computational linguistics because the whole foundation of meaning seems to be in question.",
        "The older, logical theories often subscribe to a model-theoretic philosophy of meaning (Kamp and Reyle 1993; Blackburn and Bos 2005).",
        "According to this approach, sentences should be translated to a logical form that can be interpreted as a description of the state of the world.",
        "The new vector-based techniques, on the other hand, are often closer in spirit to the philosophy of meaning as context, the idea that the meaning of an expression is determined by how it is used.",
        "This is an old idea with origins in the philosophy of Wittgenstein (1953), who said that ?meaning just is use,?",
        "Firth's (1968) ?You shall know a word by the company it keeps,?",
        "and the distributional hypothesis of Harris (1968), that words will occur in similar contexts if and only if they have similar meanings.",
        "This hypothesis is justified by the success of techniques such as latent semantic analysis as well as experimental evidence (Miller and Charles 1991).",
        "Although the two philosophies are not obviously incompatible?especially because the former applies mainly at the sentence level and the latter mainly at the word level?it is not clear how they relate to each other.",
        "The problem of how to compose vector representations of meanings of words has recently received increased attention (Clark, Coecke, and Sadrzadeh 2008; Mitchell and Lapata 2008; Widdows 2008; Erk and Pado?",
        "2009; Baroni and Zamparelli 2010; Guevara 2011; Preller and Sadrzadeh 2011) although the problem has been considered in earlier work (Smolensky 1990; Landauer and Dumais 1997; Foltz, Kintsch, and Landauer 1998; Kintsch 2001).",
        "A solution to this problem would have practical as well as philosophical benefits.",
        "Current techniques such as latent semantic analysis work well at the word level, but we cannot extend them much beyond this, to the phrase or sentence level, without quickly encountering the data-sparseness problem: There are not enough occurrences of strings of words to determine what their vectors should be merely by looking in corpora.",
        "If we knew how such vectors should compose then we would be able to extend the benefits of the vector based techniques to the many applications that require reasoning about the meaning of phrases and sentences.",
        "This article describes the results of our own efforts to identify a theory that can unite these two paradigms, introduced in the author's DPhil thesis (Clarke 2007).",
        "In addition, we also discuss the relationship between this theory and methods of composition that have recently been proposed in the literature, showing that many of them can be considered as falling within our framework.",
        "Our approach in identifying the framework is summarized in Figure 1: Inspired by the philosophy of meaning as context and vector-based techniques we developed a mathematical model of meaning as context, in which the meaning of a string is a vector representing contexts in which that string occurs in a hypothetical infinite corpus.",
        "The theory on its own is not useful when applied to real-world corpora because of the problem of data sparseness.",
        "Instead we examine the mathematical properties of the model, and abstract them to form a framework which contains many of the properties of the model.",
        "Implementations of the framework are called context theories because they can be viewed as theories about the contexts in which strings occur.",
        "By analogy with the term ?model-theoretic?",
        "we use the term ?context-theoretic?",
        "for concepts relating to context theories, thus we call our framework the context-theoretic framework.",
        "Our approach in developing the context-theoretic framework.",
        "In order to ensure that the framework was practically useful, context theories were developed in parallel with the framework itself.",
        "The aim was to be able to describe existing approaches to representing meaning within the framework as fully as possible.",
        "In developing the framework we were looking for specific properties; namely, we wanted it to: provide some guidelines describing in what way the representation of a phrase or sentence should relate to the representations of the individual words as vectors; require information about the probability of a string of words to be incorporated into the representation; provide a way to measure the degree of entailment between strings based on the particular meaning representation; be general enough to encompass logical representations of meaning; and be able to incorporate the representation of ambiguity and uncertainty, including statistical information such as the probability of a parse or the probability that a word takes a particular sense.",
        "The framework we present is abstract, and hence does not subscribe to a particular method for obtaining word vectors: They may be raw frequency counts, or vectors obtained by a method such as latent semantic analysis.",
        "Nor does the framework provide a recipe for how to represent meaning in natural language; instead it provides restrictions on the set of possibilities.",
        "The advantage of the framework is in ensuring that techniques are used in a way that is well-founded in a theory of meaning.",
        "For example, given vector representations of words, there is not one single way of combining these to give vector representations of phrases and sentences, but in order to fit within the framework there are certain properties of the representation that need to hold.",
        "Any method of combining",
        " these vectors in which these properties hold can be considered within the framework and is thus justified according to the underlying theory; in addition the framework instructs us as to how to measure the degree of entailment between strings according to that particular method.",
        "The contribution of this article is as follows: We define the context-theoretic framework and introduce the mathematics necessary to understand it.",
        "The description presented here is cleaner than that of Clarke (2007), and in addition we provide examples that should provide intuition for the concepts we describe.",
        "We relate the framework to methods of composition that have been proposed in the literature, namely:",

        "the approach of Clark, Coecke, and Sadrzadeh (2008).",
        "It is important to note that the purpose of describing related work in terms of our framework is not merely to demonstrate the generality of our framework: In doing so, we identify previously ignored features of this work such as the lattice structure within the vector space.",
        "This allows any one of these approaches to be endowed with an entailment property defined by this lattice structure, based on a philosophy of meaning as context.",
        "Although the examples described here show that existing approaches can be described within the framework and show some of its potential, they cannot demonstrate its full power.",
        "The mathematical structures we make use of are extremely general, and we hope that in the future many interesting discoveries will be made by exploring the realm we identify here.",
        "Our approach in defining the framework may be perceived as overly abstract; however, we believe this approach has many potential benefits, because approaches to composition which may have been considered unrelated (such as the tensor product and vector addition) are now shown to be related.",
        "This means that when studying such constructions, work can be avoided by considering the general case, for the same reason that class inheritance aids code reuse.",
        "For example, definitions given in terms of the framework can be applied to all instances, such as our definition of a degree of entailment.",
        "We also hope to motivate people to prove theorems in terms of the framework, having demonstrated its wide applicability.",

        "It would be interesting to investigate whether ideas from free probability would carry over to context-theoretic semantics.",
