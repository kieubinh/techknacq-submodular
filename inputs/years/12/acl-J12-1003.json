        "Three types of information have primarily been utilized in the past to learn entailment rules between predicates: lexicographic methods, distributional similarity methods, and pattern-based methods.",
        "Lexicographic methods use manually prepared knowledge bases that contain information about semantic relations between lexical items.",
        "WordNet (Fellbaum 1998b), by far the most widely used resource, specifies relations such as hyponymy, synonymy, derivation, and entailment that can be used for semantic inference (Budanitsky and Hirst 2006).",
        "For example, if WordNet specifies that reduce is a hyponym of affect, then one can infer that X reduces Y ?",
        "X affects Y. WordNet has also been exploited to automatically generate a training set for a hyponym classifier (Snow, Jurafsky, and Ng 2004), and we make a similar use of WordNet in Section 4.1.",
        "A drawback of WordNet is that it specifies semantic relations for words and terms but not for more complex expressions.",
        "For example, WordNet does not cover a complex predicate such as X causes a reduction in Y.",
        "Another drawback of WordNet is that it only supplies semantic relations between lexical items, but does not provide any information on how to map arguments of predicates.",
        "For example, WordNet specifies that there is an entailment relation between the predicates pay and buy, but does not describe the way in which arguments are mapped: if X pays Y for Z then X buys Z from Y.",
        "Thus, using WordNet directly to derive entailment rules between predicates is possible only for semantic relations such as hyponymy and synonymy, where arguments typically preserve their syntactic positions on both sides of the rule.",
        "Some knowledge bases try to overcome this difficulty: Nomlex (Macleod et al. 1998) is a dictionary that provides the mapping of arguments between verbs and their nominalizations and has been utilized to derive predicative entailment rules (Meyers et al. 2004; Szpektor and Dagan 2009).",

        ": Each frame corresponds to an event and includes information on the predicates and arguments relevant for that specific event supplemented with annotated examples that specify argument positions.",
        "Consequently, FrameNet was also used to derive entailment rules between predicates (Coyne and Rambow 2009; Ben Aharon, Szpektor, and Dagan 2010).",
        "Additional manually constructed resources for predicates include PropBank (Kingsbury, Palmer, and Marcus 2002) and VerbNet (Kipper, Dang, and Palmer 2000).",

        " Lin and Pantel (2001) proposed an algorithm that is based on a mutual information criterion.",
        "A predicate is represented by a binary template, which is a dependency path between two arguments of a predicate where the arguments are replaced by variables.",
        "Note that in a dependency tree, a path between two arguments must pass through their common predicate.",
        "Also note that if a predicate has more than two arguments, then it is represented by more than one binary template, where each template corresponds to a different aspect of the predicate.",
        "For example, the proposition I bought a gift for her contains a predicate and three arguments, and therefore is represented by the following three binary templates: X",

        "arguments and so it is possible that u ?",
        "v. Note, however, that the DIRT similarity measure computes a symmetric score, which is appropriate for modeling synonymy but not entailment, an inherently directional relation.",
        "To remedy that, Szpektor and Dagan (2008) suggested a directional distributional similarity measure.",
        "In their work, Szpektor and Dagan chose to represent predicates with unary templates, which are identical to binary templates, only they contain a predicate and a single argument, such as: X subj ???",
        "buys.",
        "Szpektor and Dagan explain that unary templates are more expressive than binary templates, and that some predicates can only be encoded using unary templates.",
        "They propose that if for two unary templates u ?",
        "v, then relatively many of the features of u should be covered by the features of v. This is captured by the asymmetric Cover measure suggested by Weeds and Weir (2003) (we omit the subscript x from Fux and F v x because in their setting there is only one argument):",
        "The final directional score, termed BInc (Balanced Inclusion), is the geometric average of the Lin measure and the Cover measure:",
        "Berant et al. Learning Entailment Relations by Global Graph Structure Optimization Both Lin and Pantel as well as Szpektor and Dagan compute a similarity score for each argument separately, effectively decoupling the arguments from one another.",
        "It is clear, however, that although this alleviates sparsity problems, it disregards an important piece of information, namely, the co-occurrence of arguments.",
        "For example, if one looks at the following propositions: coffee increases blood pressure, coffee decreases fatigue, wine decreases blood pressure, wine increases fatigue, one can notice that the predicates occur with similar arguments and might mistakenly infer that decrease ?",
        "increase.",
        "However, looking at pairs of arguments reveals that the predicates do not share a single pair of arguments.",
        "Yates and Etzioni (2009) address this issue and propose a generative model that estimates the probability that two predicates are synonymous (synonymy is simply bidirectional entailment) by comparing pairs of arguments.",
        "They represent predicates and arguments as strings and compute for every predicate a feature vector that counts that number of times it occurs with any ordered pair of words as arguments.",
        "Their main modeling decision is to assume that two predicates are synonymous if the number of pairs of arguments they share is maximal.",
        "An earlier work by Szpektor et al. (2004) also tried to learn entailment rules between predicates by using pairs of arguments as features.",

        "Pattern-based methods are used to automatically extract pairs of predicates for a specific semantic relation.",
        "Pattern-based methods identify a semantic relation between two predicates by observing that they co-occur in specific patterns in sentences.",

        "Note also that the feature h-b-L-pCt, which uses binary templates, the Lin similarity measure, and features that are pairs of CUI tuples, is the best feature both in terms of the ablation test and when it is used as a single feature for the classifier.",
        "The result obtained by this feature is only 3.3 points lower than that obtained when using the entire feature set.",
        "We believe this is for two reasons: First, the 16 distributional similarity features are correlated with one another and thus using all of them does not boost performance substantially.",

        "The second reason for gaining only 3.3 points by the remaining features is that, as discussed, the new set of features is relatively sparse.",
        "To sum up, we suggest several hypotheses that explain our results and analysis: The new features are too sparse to substantially improve the performance of the local entailment classifier in our data set.",
        "This perhaps can be attributed to the nature of our domain-specific healthcare corpus.",
        "In the future, we would like to examine the sparsity of these features in a general domain.",
        "Looking at the training set accuracy, ablations, and precision of the new features, it seems that the behavior of most of them is reasonable.",
        "Thus, it is possible that in a different learning scheme that does not use the resources as features the information they provide may become beneficial.",
        "For example, in a simple ?back-off?",
        "approach one can use rules from precise resources to determine entailment, and apply a classifier only when no precise resource contains a relevant rule.",
        "In our corpus representing distributional similarity features with pairs of argument instantiations is better than treating each argument independently.",
        " Given the current training set accuracy and the sparsity of the new features, it is important to develop methods that gather large-scale information that is orthogonal to distributional similarity.",
        "In our opinion, the most promising direction for acquiring such rich information is by methods that look at co-occurrence of predicates or templates on the Web (Chklovski and Pantel 2004; Pekar 2008)."

      "heading": "7. Conclusions and Future Work",
      "text": [
        "This article presented a global optimization algorithm for learning entailment rules between predicates, represented as propositional templates.",
        "Most previous work on learning entailment rules between predicates focused on local learning methods, which consider each pair of predicates in isolation.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive attempt to date to exploit global interactions between predicates for improving the set of learned entailment rules.",
        "We modeled the problem as a graph learning problem, and searched for the best graph under a global transitivity constraint.",
        "Two objective functions were defined for the optimization procedure, one score-based and the other probabilistic, and we have shown that under certain conditions (specified in Appendix A) the score-based function can be interpreted probabilistically.",
        "This allowed us to use both margin as well as probabilistic classifiers for the underlying entailment classifier.",
        "We solved the optimization problem using Integer Linear Programming, which provides an optimal solution (compared to the greedy algorithm suggested by Snow, Jurafsky, and Ng [2006]), and demonstrated empirically that this method outperforms local algorithms as well as a state-of-the-art greedy optimization algorithm on the graph learning task.",
        "We also analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively the reasons for the improved performance of our global algorithm and performed detailed error analysis.",
        "Last, we experimented with various entailment classifiers that utilize different sets of features from many knowledge bases.",
        "The experiments and analysis performed indicate that the current performance of the local entailment classifier needs to be improved.",
        "We believe that the most promising direction for improving the local classifier is to use methods that look for co-occurrence of predicates in sentences or documents on the Web, because these methods excel at identifying specific semantic relations.",
        "It is also possible to use other sources of information such as lexicographic resources, although this probably will require a learning scheme that is robust to the relatively low coverage of these resources.",
        "Increasing the size of the training corpus is also an important direction for improving the entailment classifier.",
        "Another important direction for future work is to apply our algorithm to graphs that are larger by a few orders of magnitude than the focused entailment graphs dealt with in this article.",
        "This will introduce a challenge to our current optimization algorithm due to complexity issues, as our ILP contains O(|V|3) constraints.",
        "In addition, this will require careful handling of predicate ambiguity, which interferes with the transitivity of entailment and will become a pertinent issue in large graphs.",
        "Some first steps in this direction have already been carried out (Berant, Dagan, and Goldberger 2011).",
        "In addition, our graphs currently contain a single type of edge, namely, the entailment relation.",
        "We would like to model more types of edges in the graph, representing additional semantic relations such as co-hyponymy, and to explicitly describe the interactions between the various types of edges, aiming to further improve the quality of the learned entailment rules.",
        "Berant et al. Learning Entailment Relations by Global Graph Structure Optimization Figure 8 A hierarchical summary of propositions involving nausea as an argument, such as headache is related to nausea, acupuncture helps with nausea, and Lorazepam treats nausea.",
        "Last, in Section 3.1 we mentioned that by merging strongly connected components in entailment graphs, hierarchies of predicates can be generated (recall Figure 1).",
        "As proposed by Berant, Dagan, and Goldberger (2010), we believe that these hierarchies can be useful not only in the context of semantic inference applications, but also in the field of faceted search and hierarchical text exploration (Stoica, Hearst, and Richardson 2007).",
        "Figure 8 exemplifies how a set of propositions can be presented to a user according to the hierarchy of predicates shown in Figure 1.",
        "In the field of faceted search, information is presented using a number of hierarchies, corresponding to different facets or dimensions of the data.",
        "One can easily use the hierarchy of predicates learned by our algorithm as an additional facet in the context of a text-exploration application.",
        "In future work, we intend to implement this application and perform user experiments to test whether adding this hierarchy facilitates exploration of textual information.",

        "Assumption A.3 states that each feature vector is independent from other feature vectors given the graph.",
        "Assumption A.4 states that the features Fuv for the pair (u, v) are generated by a distribution depending only on whether entailment holds for (u, v).",
        "Last, Assumption A.5 states that edges are independent and the prior probability of a graph is a product of the prior probabilities of the edges.",
        "Using these assumptions and equations A.1 and A.2, we can now express the posterior P(G|F):",
        "Note that under the ?local model?",
        "the prior for an edge in the graph was uniform, because the model was trained over a balanced training set.",
        "Generally, however, this is not the case, and thus we introduce an edge prior into the model when formulating the global objective function.",
