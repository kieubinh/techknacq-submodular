        "Now imagine a computer being confronted with the same task, aiming to point out individual d1.",
        "Assuming it has access to a database containing all the relevant properties of the people in the scene, it needs to find some combination of properties which applies to d1, and not to the other two.",
        "There is a choice though: There are many ways in which d1 can be set apart from the rest (?the man on the left,?",
        "?the man with the glasses,?",
        "?the man with the tie?",
        "), and the computer has to decide which of these is optimal in the given context.",
        "Moreover, optimality can mean different things.",
        "It might be thought, for instance, that references are optimal when they are minimal in length, containing just enough information to single out the target.",
        "But, as we shall see, finding minimal references is computationally expensive, and it is not necessarily what speakers do, nor what is most useful to hearers.",

        "A survey of implemented, practical NLG systems shows that virtually all of them, regardless of their purpose, contain an REG module of some sort (Mellish et al. 2006).",
        "This is hardly surprising in view of the central role that reference plays in communication.",
        "A system providing advice about air travel (White, Clark, and Moore 2010) needs to refer to flights (?the cheapest flight,?",

        "), and a robot dialogue system that assembles construction toys together with a human user (Giuliani et al. 2010) needs to refer to the components (?insert the green bolt through the end of this red cube?).",
        "REG ?is concerned with how we produce a description of an entity that enables the hearer to identify that entity in a given context?",
        "(Reiter and Dale 2000, page 55).",
        "Because this can often be done in many different ways, a REG algorithm needs to make a number of choices.",
        "According to Reiter and Dale (2000), the first choice concerns what form of referring expression is to be used; should the target be referred to, for instance, using its proper name, a pronoun (?he?",
        "), or a description (?the man with the tie?).",
        "Proper names have limited applicability because many domain objects do not have a name that is in common usage.",
        "For pronoun generation, a simple but conservative rule is discussed by Reiter and Dale (2000), similar to one proposed by Dale (1989, pages 150?151): Use a pronoun if the target was mentioned in the previous sentence, and if this sentence contained no reference to any other entity of the same gender.",
        "Reiter and Dale (2000) concentrate mostly on the generation of descriptions.",
        "If the NLG system decides to generate a description, two choices need to be made: Which set of properties distinguishes the target (content selection), and how the selected properties are to be turned into natural language (linguistic realization).",
        "Content selection is a complex balancing act: We need to say enough to enable identification of the intended referent, but not too much.",
        "A selection of information needs to be made, and this needs to be done quickly.",

        "Why a survey on REG, and how to read it?",
        "REG, like NLG in general, has changed considerably since the overviews presented in Dale and Reiter (1995) and Reiter and Dale (2000), owing largely to an increased use of empirical data, and a widening of the class of referring expressions studied.",
        "Moreover, a gradual shift has taken place towards extended application domains, different input and output formats, and more flexible interactions with the user, and this shift is starting to necessitate the use of new REG techniques.",
        "Examples include recent systems in areas such as weather forecasting (Turner, Sripada, and Reiter 2009) and medical care (Portet et al. 2009), where complex references to spatial regions and time periods abound.",
        "The results of recent REG research are scattered over proceedings, books, and journals.",
        "The current survey offers a compact overview of the progress in this area and an assessment of the state of the art.",
        "The concept of reference is difficult to pin down exactly (Searle 1969; Abbott 2010).",
        "Searle therefore suggests that the proper approach is ?to examine those cases which constitute the center of variation of the concept of referring and then examine the borderline cases in light of similarities and differences from the paradigms?",
        "(Searle 1969, pages 26?",
        "27).",
        "The ?paradigms?",
        "of reference in Reiter and Dale (2000) are definite descriptions whose primary purpose it is to identify their referent.",
        "The vast majority of recent REG research subscribes to this view as well.",
        "Accordingly these paradigmatic cases will also be the main focus of this survey, although we shall often have occasion to discuss other types of expressions.",
        "However, to do full justice to indefinite or attributive descriptions, proper names, and personal pronouns would, in our view, require a separate, additional survey.",
        "In Section 2 we offer a brief overview of REG research up to 2000, discussing some classic algorithms.",
        "Next, we zoom in on the new directions in which recent work has taken REG research: extension of the coverage of algorithms, to include, for example, vague, relational, and plural descriptions (Section 3), exploration of different computational frameworks, such as Graph Theory and Description Logic (Section 4), and collection of data and evaluation of REG algorithms (Section 5).",

        "Second, evaluations suggest that human-produced descriptions differ from automatically generated ones in a number of ways.",
        "Human references often include redundant information, making the descriptions overspecified in ways that were not accounted for by standard REG algorithms.",
        "An additional problem is that there appears to be considerable individual variation, both within and between speakers, which is something that existing REG algorithms do not model (Dale and Viethen 2010).",
        "Third, it is still somewhat unclear what the best REG evaluation metrics are.",
        "The three REG Challenges based on the TUNA set-up offer a wealth of information in this respect (Gatt and Belz 2010).",
        "In each of these challenges, a number of research teams submitted one or more REG generation systems, allowing detailed statistical analyses over the various metrics.",
        "It was found that Dice, MASI, and PRP are very highly correlated (all r > .95).",
        "Interestingly, these metrics correlate negatively with the proportion of references that are minimally specified (Gatt, Belz, and Kow 2008); in other words, systems that produce more overspecified references tend to do better in terms of Dice and other overlap metrics.",
        "Concerning the surface realization metrics, it was found that?when comparing different realizations of a given set of attributes?the NIST and BLEU string metrics correlate strongly with each other (r = .9), as one might expect, but neither correlates well with Levenshtein distance (Gatt, Belz, and Kow 2008).",
        "As for the extrinsic measures, Gatt, Belz, and Kow (2008) only report a significant correlation between reading time and identification time, which suggests that slow readers are also slow identifiers, or that referring expressions that are hard to read also make it harder to identify the intended referent.",
        "Gatt, Belz, and Kow (2009) let participants listen to expressions that were produced either automatically or by human",
        " speakers, and found a strong correlation between identification accuracy and adequacy, suggesting that more adequate references also have more correct identifications.",
        "Also, they found a negative correlation between fluency and identification time, implying that more fluent descriptions reduce the identification time.",
        "It is notable that essentially no correlations were found between these extrinsic task performance measures and the automatic metrics for human-likeness (Belz and Gatt 2008; Gatt and Belz 2010).",
        "Different explanations are possible for this lack of correlation.",
        "Gatt and Belz (2010) note that the nature of the TUNA data could be partly responsible.",
        "The TUNA data collection was carried out in a Web-based and relatively unrestricted manner, and idiosyncratic references do occur in it (?a red chair, if you sit on it, your feet would show the south east?).",
        "It is possible that for another, more controlled corpus, a correlation between the two kinds of metrics would show up.",
        "It could also be that people are not always very good at designing their utterances in a way that is optimal for hearers (Horton and Keysar 1996; see also Section 6), so producing descriptions that resemble human-produced ones is not the same as producing descriptions that are of optimal use for hearers.",
        "This suggests that the two sets of metrics measure different things, and that they correspond with two different aims that the designer of a REG algorithm might have: One set of metrics could be used if the aim is to mimic speakers, another if the aim is to produce optimal benefits for hearers.",
        "So far, experimental evaluation has mostly been limited to the simplest of situations, focusing on algorithms that produce singular descriptions, expressing conjunctions of basic properties in small and artificial domains.",
        "Most of the extensions discussed in Section 3 have not been evaluated systematically.",
        "Moreover, tasks such as the one on which the TUNA corpus is based can be argued not to be ?ecologically valid?",
        ": Human participants produce typewritten expressions for an imaginary audience on the basis of abstract visual scenes.",
        "The effects of these limitations on the descriptions produced are partly unknown, although some reassuring results have recently been obtained.",
        "It has been shown, for example, that, speakers who address an imaginary audience refer in similar ways to those who address an audience that is physically present (van der Wege 2009).",
        "Similarly, Koolen et al. (2009) show that speaking rather than typing has no effect on the kind and number of attributes in the referring expressions that are produced, although speakers tend to use more words than typists to convey the same amount of information.",
        "It would nevertheless be valuable to evaluate REG algorithms in the context of a specific application, so the added value of different REG algorithms for a real-life application can be gauged (Gatt, Belz, and Kow 2009).",
        "Two recent evaluation challenges seem promising for these reasons.",
        "GREC (Belz et al. 2010) focuses on the task of deciding which form a referring expression should take in a textual context, which is important for generating coherent texts such as summaries (see also Section 6).",
        "GIVE (Koller et al. 2010) focuses on generating directions in a virtual 3D environment, where reference is only one task among a number of others.",
        "This new challenge has so far not included a separate test of REG algorithms employed in the systems submitted, but it seems likely that GIVE will cause REG research to focus on harder tasks, including reference in discourse context, reference to sets, and references that are spread out over several utterances (Denis 2010)."

        "It seems reasonable to assume that frequency tells us something about preference: A property that is used frequently is also more likely to be high on the list of preferred properties (Gatt and Belz 2010; van Deemter et al. in press).",
        "But suitable corpora to determine preferences are rare, as we have seen, and their construction is time-consuming.",
        "This raises the question of how much data would be needed to make reasonable guesses about preferred properties; this could be studied, for instance, by drawing learning curves where increasingly large proportions of a transparent corpus are used to estimate a preference order and the corresponding performance is measured.",
        "The IA is more drastically under-determined than most other algorithms: The Full Brevity and the Greedy Heuristic algorithm are specified completely up to situations where there is a tie?a tie between two equally lengthy descriptions in the first case, and a tie between two properties that have the same discriminatory power in the second.",
        "To resolve such ties frequency data would clearly be helpful.",
        "Similar questions apply to other generation algorithms.",
        "For instance, the graph-based algorithm as described by Krahmer et al. (2008) assigns one of three different costs to properties (they can be free, cheap, or somewhat expensive), and frequency data is used to determine which costs should be assigned to which properties (properties that are almost always used in a particular domain can be for free, etc.).",

        "Progress has been made in three related areas which have been discussed extensively in this survey.",
        "First, researchers have lifted a number of simplifications present in the work of Dale and Reiter (1995) and others, thereby considerably extending coverage of REG algorithms to include, for instance, relational, plural, and vague references (Section 3).",
        "Second, proposals have been put forward to recast REG in terms of existing and well-understood computational frameworks, such as labeled directed graphs and Description Logic, with various attractive consequences (Section 4).",
        "Third, there has been a shift towards data collection and empirical evaluation; this has made it possible to empirically evaluate REG algorithms, which is starting to give us an improved understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of existing work (Section 5).",
        "As a result of these developments, REG is now one of the best-developed subfields of NLG.",
        "How should the current state of the art in REG be assessed?",
        "The good news is that current REG algorithms can produce natural descriptions, which may even be more helpful than descriptions produced by people (Gatt, Belz, and Kow 2009).",
        "This is only true when certain simplifying assumptions are made, however, as in the early REG research typified by Dale and Reiter (1995).",
        "When REG leaves this limited ?comfort zone,?",
        "the picture changes drastically.",
        "Although in recent years the research community has gained a much better understanding of the challenges that face REG in that wider arena, many of these challenges are still waiting to be met (Section 6)."

        "Recent efforts to let REG algorithms refer to spatial regions suggest that in large, realistic domains, precise identification of a target is a goal that can be approximated, but seldom achieved (Turner et al. 2008; Turner, Sripada, and Reiter 2009).",

        "and",
        " say what they regarded as their criterion for success.",

        ": If speakers produce unclear descriptions, then so should algorithms.",

        "In NLG systems whose main aim is to be practically useful, for example, it may be more important for referring expressions to be clear than to be human-like in all respects.",
        "The difference is important because psycholinguists have shown that human speakers have only limited capabilities for taking the addressee into account, frequently producing expressions that cannot be interpreted correctly by an addressee?for example, when they are under time pressure (Horton and Keysar 1996).",
        "If usefulness or successfulness (Garoufi and Koller 2011), rather than human-likeness, is the yardstick for success then a different type of evaluation test needs to be used.",
        "Possible tests include, for example, speed and accuracy of task completion (i.e., how often and how fast do readers find the referent?).",
        "A variety of hearer-oriented tests is starting to be used in recent REG research (Paraboni, van Deemter, and Masthoff 2007; Khan, van Deemter, and Ritchie 2008), but evaluation of REG algorithms (and of NLG in general) remains difficult (see, e.g., Oberlander 1998; Belz 2009; and Gatt and Belz 2010).",
        "Arguably, a central problem is that many different evaluations metrics are conceivable, and an REG algorithm (like an NLG system in general) may well score high on some and poorly on other metrics.",
        "Hearer-oriented experiments may also be useful for evaluating referring expressions that are logically complex (cf.",

        "), which can be generated using the same methods.",
        "There are difficult methodological questions to be answered here about whether the aim of the generator is to model human competence or human performance.",
