        "We describe a novel domain, Fruit Carts, aimed at eliciting human language production for the twin purposes of (a) dialogue system research and development and (b) psycholinguistic research.",
        "Fruit Carts contains five tasks: choosing a cart, placing it on a map, painting the cart, rotating the cart, and filling the cart with fruit.",
        "Fruit Carts has been used for research in psycholinguistics and in dialogue systems.",
        "Based on these experiences, we discuss how well the Fruit Carts domain meets four desired features: unscripted, context-constrained, controllable difficulty, and separability into semi-independent subdialogues.",

        "Dialogue system research, like much else in computational linguistics, has greatly benefited from corpora of natural speech.",
        "With notable exceptions (e.g. the Edinburgh Maptask, Anderson et al. [1991]), these corpora consist of samples annotated with linguistic properties (e.g. POS, syntax, discourse status) setting aside the visual and",
        "pragmatic aspects of the context in which they occurred.",
        "In recent years natural language processing (NLP) researchers have been working to incorporate visual and other context into their models and systems (DeVault and Stone 2004; Gabsdil and Lemon 2004; Schuler, Wu, and Schwartz 2009).",
        "This is consistent with the growing evidence in psycholinguistics that human language production crucially depends on such aspects of context.",
        "To take this NLP research further, there is a need for more corpora that include both variation in, and annotation of, visual and pragmatic context.",
        "There are still many open questions that span computational linguistics and psycholinguistics concerning how natural language and context are related.",
        "One core question at the intersection of these areas is how the inherent difficulty of describing an end-goal (i.e., its codability) will affect the structure and content of referring expressions and the referential strategy speakers adopt.",
        "Referential strategies are a topic of growing interest in natural language generation.",
        "In recent work, Viethen and Dale (2006) demonstrated that even when describing simple grid layouts, people adopt different referential strategies, due perhaps to proximity to landmarks (and hence codability): the orange drawer below the two yellow drawers, in contrast to the yellow drawer in the third column from the left second from the top.",
        "For systems to produce humanlike references in these situations, existing methods of reference generation will need to be modified or extended to include better models of the choice of referential strategies (Viethen and Dale 2006).",
        "Such models can also be expected to improve reference resolution: If better predictions can be made about what people will say in a given situation, automatic speech recognition language models can be tighter, NLP grammars can be smaller, and unlikely parses can be avoided, improving both speed and accuracy.",
        "Recent psycholinguistic research suggests that codability does play a role in human reference production (e.g., Cook, Jaeger, and Tanenhaus 2009).",
        "This work has largely focused on timing, signals of production difficulty (e.g., disfluency, gesture), and the content of referring expressions (e.g., adjectives, pronouns).",
        "There has been much less consideration of how entire referential strategies might systematically vary with codability.",
        "A corpus with the correct design and structure will allow for investigation of the more well-studied aspects as well as higher-level factors such as strategy choice, and possible interactions between them.",
        "With these considerations in mind, we designed a domain, Fruit Carts, and a set of corresponding tasks in order to elicit human language production for two purposes: 1) the testing of psycholinguistic hypotheses, specifically that object complexity modulates referential strategy, and more generally the exploration of the relationship between visual context and human?human dialogue, and 2) research and development of dialogue systems that understand language as it unfolds, taking pragmatic factors into account early in the recognition process.",
        "By designing with both fields in mind we hope to strengthen the long tradition of cross-fertilization between the disciplines (e.g., Brennan 1991), particularly for task-or game-oriented systems and domains, with a visual component.",
        "We identified four important features to build into the domain.",
        "First, the language produced should be completely unscripted: Participants should be able to perform the task with a general description of what to do (e.g., Give instructions on how to make the map on the screen look like the map in your hand) and zero prior examples of what to say.",
        "For psycholinguistics, this makes the language natural speech rather than speech that is restricted by the instructions or by prior examples.",
        "For dialogue systems, this makes the language ?untrained?",
        "rather than the result of careful training, meaning that systems will be processing language that is representative of what speakers are likely to produce when they use the system, especially without extensive training.",
        "Second,",
        "Aist et al. Fruit Carts Domain and Corpus the language should be fairly well constrained by context.",
        "For psycholinguistics, this makes the language more straightforward to analyze and also more directly tied to the visual context and thus amenable to ?visual world?",
        "studies that use eye movements to examine real-time production (Griffin and Bock 2000) and comprehension (Tanenhaus et al. 1995).",
        "For dialogue systems, this makes the language more amenable to automatic processing and also facilitates the integration of different types of knowledge into the recognition process.",
        "Third, it should be possible to vary the difficulty of the tasks.",
        "For psycholinguistics, this makes hypotheses about the effect of task difficulty on language production amenable to study.",
        "For dialogue systems, this allows the resulting corpora to have a combination of relatively easy tasks (?low-hanging fruit?)",
        "and more difficult NLP challenges.",
        "Fourth, the domain should support the collection of dialogues that are separable into partially or semi-independent subdialogues, with limited need for reference to previous subdialogues.",
        "For psycholinguistics, this makes each subdialogue a separate trial, allowing for analyses where trials are treated as random effects in mixed-effect regression models or repeated measures in ANOVAs.",
        "For dialogue systems, this limits the likelihood that errors in processing one subdialogue will spill over and affect processing of subsequent subdialogues.",
        "For both research areas, this separability constraint enables within-subject experiments with each subdialogue as a trial.",
        "In purpose and approach, Fruit Carts is most similar to the Map Task (Anderson et al. 1991); both are simultaneously a set of experiments on language and a corpus used for developing language processing systems.",
        "Map Task dialogues ?are unscripted [but] the corpus as a whole comprises a large, carefully controlled elicitation exercise?",
        "(Anderson et al. 1991, page 352) that has been used inmany computational endeavors as well.",
        "Fruit Carts was guided by our twin goals of furthering the development of spoken language systems, and providing a psycholinguistic test bed in which to test specific hypotheses about human language production.",
        "Fruit Carts differs from Map Task in terms of dynamic object properties and in terms of the information available to the speaker and hearer.",
        "In the Map Task, objects have fixed properties that differ between giver and follower, yet remain constant while the path is constructed.",
        "In Fruit Carts, objects have properties that can be changed: position, angle, and color.",
        "This allows for a wide variety of linguistic behavior which in turn supports detailed exploration of continuous understanding by humans and machines.",
        "In the Map Task, the participants?",
        "screens differ, whereas in Fruit Carts the speaker and hearer share the same visual context, which simplifies the analysis and interpretation of results (Figure 1)."

        "The Fruit Carts domain has three screen areas: amap, an object bin, and a controls panel.",

        "The map contains named regions divided by solid lines, with three flags as landmarks.",
        "The region names did not appear on the screen, to preclude use of spelling in referring expressions (the C in Central Park).",
        "Names were chosen to be phonetically distinct.",

        "The final configuration shown is the actual screen after the five dialogues from the participant whose third, fourth, and fifth dialogues are shown in Appendix A.",
        "The object bin contains fruits and carts, by analogy with food vendor carts (e.g., hot dog stands).",
        "The fruits are avocados, bananas, cucumbers, grapefruits, and tomatoes, all botanically fruits.",
        "We chose fruits because they were nameable, especially with a label, and visually different from the carts.",
        "The carts are either squares or triangles, in two sizes, with an optional tag that for squares is either a diamond or a heart and for triangles is either a star or a circle.",
        "Adjectives (e.g., large, small) are commonly used in natural language descriptions and there is a growing body of psycholinguistic research, mostly with scripted utterances, that has used adjectives to investigate real-time language processing (Sedivy et al. 1999; Brown-Schmidt, Campana, and Tanenhaus 2005).",
        "Here, to support progressive restriction of potential carts, each component is easy to name but the entire shape requires a complex description rather than a prenominal modifier?or at least strongly prefers one, as no examples to the contrary were observed in the Fruit Carts corpus described later in this article.",
        "That is, whereas a square with stripes could be either the square with stripes or the striped square, a square with a diamond on the corner is the square with a diamond on the corner but not *the corner-diamonded square.",
        "The controls panel contains left and right rotation arrows and six paint colors (black, brown, orange, blue, pink, and purple) chosen to be distinct from the colors of the fruit.",

        "As Appendix A illustrates, these Fruit Carts data contain relatively few such references.",

        "For other utterances, grounding relied on the surrounding context?dialogue and/or task.",
        "For example, um a little to the left [D4] contains a direction (left) but might rely on the last action to identify the intended action as rotation or movement, and on the selected shape on the screen to identify the object.",
