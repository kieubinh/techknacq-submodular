        "Typically, the setting in these cases is different from our setting: Error is measured as the probability mass of strings that are not identified correctly by the learned finite state automaton, instead of measuring KL divergence between the automaton and the true distribution.",

        "To the best of our knowledge, it is still an open problem whether finite state automata are learnable in the distribution-dependent setting when measuring the error as the fraction of misidentified strings.",

        "In that study, the authors provided positive results for the sample complexity for learning probabilistic automata?they showed that a polynomial sample is sufficient for MLE.",
        "We demonstrate positive results for the more general class of probabilistic grammars which goes beyond probabilistic automata.",
        "Abe and Warmuth also showed that the problem of finding or even approximating the maximum likelihood solution for a two-state probabilistic automaton with an alphabet of an arbitrary size is hard.",
        "Even though these results extend to probabilistic grammars to some extent, we provide a novel proof that illustrates the NP-hardness of identifying the maximum likelihood solution for probabilistic grammars in the specific framework of ?proper approximations?",
        "that we define in this article.",
        "Whereas Abe and Warmuth show that the problem of maximum likelihood maximization for two-state HMMs is not approximable within a certain factor in time polynomial in the alphabet and the length of the observed sequence, we show that there is no polynomial algorithm (in the length of the observed strings) that identifies the maximum likelihood estimator in our framework.",
        "In our reduction, from 3-SAT to the problem of maximum likelihood estimation, the alphabet used is binary and the grammar size is proportional to the length of the formula.",
        "In Abe andWarmuth, the alphabet size varies, and the number of states is two.",
        "This article proceeds as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we review the background necessary from Vapnik's (1988) empirical risk minimization framework.",
        "This framework is reduced to maximum likelihood estimation when a specific loss function is used: the log-loss.",
        "There are some shortcomings in using the empirical risk minimization framework in its simplest form.",
        "In its simplest form, the ERM framework is distribution-free, which means that we make no assumptions about the distribution that generated the data.",
        "Naively attempting to apply the ERM framework to probabilistic grammars in the distribution-free setting does not lead to the desired sample complexity bounds.",
        "The reason for this is that the log-loss diverges whenever small probabilities are allocated in the learned hypothesis to structures or strings that have a rather large probability in the probability distribution that generates the data.",
        "With a distribution-free assumption, therefore, we would have to give treatment to distributions that are unlikely to be true for natural language data (e.g., where some extremely long sentences are very probable).",
        "To correct for this, we move to an analysis in a distribution-dependent setting, by presenting a set of assumptions about the distribution that generates the data.",
        "In Section 3 we discuss probabilistic grammars in a general way and introduce assumptions about the true distribution that are reasonable when our data come from natural language examples.",
        "It is important to note that this distribution need not be a probabilistic grammar.",
        "The next stepwe take, in Section 4, is approximating the set of probabilistic grammars over which we maximize likelihood.",
        "This is again required in order to overcome the divergence of the log-loss for probabilities that are very small.",
        "Our approximations are",
        " based on bounded approximations that have been used for deriving sample complexity bounds for graphical models in a distribution-free setting (Dasgupta 1997).",
        "Our approximations have two important properties: They are, by themselves, probabilistic grammars from the family we are interested in estimating, and they become a tighter approximation around the family of probabilistic grammars we are interested in estimating as more samples are available.",
        "Moving to the distribution-dependent setting and defining proper approximations enables us to derive sample complexity bounds.",
        "In Section 5 we present the sample complexity results for both the supervised and unsupervised cases.",
        "A question that lingers at this point is whether it is computationally feasible to maximize likelihood in our framework even when given enough samples.",
        "In Section 6, we describe algorithms we use to estimate probabilistic grammars in our framework, when given access to the required number of samples.",
        "We show that in the supervised case, we can indeed maximize likelihood in our approximation framework using a simple algorithm.",
        "For the unsupervised case, however, we show that maximizing likelihood is NP-hard.",
        "This fact is related to a notion known in the learning theory literature as inherent unpredictability (Kearns and Vazirani 1994): Accurate learning is computationally hard evenwith enough samples.",
        "To overcome this difficulty, we adapt the expectation-maximization algorithm (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977) to approximately maximize likelihood (or minimize log-loss) in the unsupervised case with proper approximations.",
        "In Section 7 we discuss some related ideas.",
        "These include the failure of an alternative kind of distributional assumption and connections to regularization by maximum a posteriori estimation with Dirichlet priors.",
