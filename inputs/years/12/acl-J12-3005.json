        "We aim at automatically inducing the semantic class for an adjective given its linguistic properties, as extracted from corpora and other resources.",
        "The acquisition of semantic classes has been widely studied for verbs (Dorr and Jones 1996; McCarthy 2000; Korhonen, Krymolowski, and Marx 2003; Lapata and Brew 2004; Schulte im Walde 2006; Joanis, Stevenson, and James 2008) and, to a lesser extent, for nouns (Hindle 1990; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993), but, with very few exceptions (Bohnet, Klatt, and Wanner 2002; Carvalho and Ranchhod 2003), not for adjectives.",
        "Furthermore, we cannot rely on a well-established classification for adjectives.",
        "The classes themselves are subject to experimentation.",
        "We will test two different classifications, analyzing the empirical properties of the classes and the problems in their definition.",
        "Another significant challenge is posed by polysemy, or the fact that one and the same adjective can have multiple senses.",
        "Different senses may fall into different classes, such that it is no longer possible to identify one single semantic class per adjective.",
        "Moreover, many adjectives exhibit similar sense alternations, in a phenomenon known as regular or systematic polysemy (Apresjan 1974; Copestake and Briscoe 1995).",
        "A special focus of the research presented, therefore, is on modeling regular polysemy.",
        "As an example of regular polysemy, take for instance the sense alternation for the adjective econo`mic exemplified in Example (1).",
        "Econo`mic, derived from economia (?economy?",

        "The first senses in Examples (1) and (2) have a transparent relation to the denotation of the deriving noun, as witnessed by the fact that they are translated as nouns in English (economy, family, love), whereas the other senses are translated as adjectives (cheap, familiar, lovely).",
        "For each of these adjectives, there is a relationship between the two senses, such that the sense alternations seem to correspond to a productive semantic process along the lines of Example (3) (Raskin and Nirenburg 1998, schema (43), page 173).",

        "In this article, therefore, we not only address the acquisition of semantic classes, but also the acquisition of polysemy: Our goal is to determine, for a given adjective, whether it is monosemous or polysemous, and to which class(es) it belongs.",
        "Note that we are not dealing with individual sense alternations, as related work on sense induction does (Schu?tze 1998; McCarthy et al. 2004; Brody and Lapata 2009), but with sense alternation types, that systematically hold across different lemmata.",
        "Thus, the present research is at the crossroad between sense induction and lexical acquisition.",
        "Regularities in sense alternations are pervasive in human languages, and they are probably favored by the properties of human cognition (Murphy 2002).",
        "Regular polysemy has been studied in theoretical linguistics (Apresjan 1974; Pustejovsky 1995) and in symbolic approaches to computational semantics (Copestake and Briscoe 1995).",
        "It has received little attention in empirical computational semantics, however.",
        "This is surprising, given the amount of work devoted to sense-related tasks such as Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD).",
        "In WSD (see Navigli [2009] for an overview) sense ambiguities are almost exclusively modeled for each individual lemma, despite the ensuing sparsity problems (Ando [2006] is an exception).",

        "In this direction, we test two alternative approaches.",
        "We first model polysemy in terms of independent classes to be separately acquired (e.g., an adjective with two senses ai and bi belongs to a class AB defined independently of classes A and B), and show that this model is not adequate.",
        "A second approach, which posits that polysemous adjectives simultaneously belong to more than one class (e.g., an adjective with two senses ai and bi belongs to both class A and class B), is more successful.",
        "Our best classifier achieves 69.1% accuracy against a 51% baseline, which is satisfactory, considering that the estimated upper bound (human agreement) for this task is 68%.",
        "We discuss pros and cons of the two models described and ways to overcome their limitations.",
        "In the following, we first review related work (Section 2) and linguistic aspects of adjective classification (Section 3), then present the two acquisition experiments (Sections 4 and 5), and finish with a general discussion (Section 6) and some conclusions and directions for future research (Section 7)."

        "As mentioned in the Introduction, there has been very little research in the semantic classification of adjectives.",
        "We know of only two articles on specifically this topic: Carvalho and Ranchhod (2003) used adjective classes similar to the ones explored here to disambiguate between nominal and adjectival readings in Portuguese.",
        "Adjective information, manually coded, served to establish constraints in a finite-state transducer part-of-speech tagger.",
        "Actually, POS tagging was also the initial motivation for the present research, as adjective?noun and adjective?verb (participle) ambiguities cause most difficulties to both humans and machines in languages such as English, German, and Catalan (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993; Brants 2000; Boleda 2007).",
        "Bohnet, Klatt, and Wanner (2002) also has similar goals to the present research, as it is aimed at automatically classifying German adjectives.",
        "However, the classification",
        " used is not purely semantic, polysemy is not taken into account, and the evidence and techniques used are more limited than the ones used here.",
        "Other research on adjectives within computational linguistics is oriented toward different goals than ours.",
        "Yallop, Korhonen, and Briscoe (2005) tackle syntactic, not semantic classification, akin to the acquisition of subcategorization frames for verbs.",
        "Another relevant line of research pursues WSD.",
        "Justeson and Katz (1995) and Chao and Dyer (2000) showed that adjectives are a very useful cue for disambiguating the sense of the nouns they modify.",
        "Adjective classes could be further exploited in WSD in at least two respects: (1) to establish an inventory of adjective senses (if polysemous instances are correctly detected; this is where sense induction and our own work fits in), and (2) to exploit class-based properties for the disambiguation, similar to related work on verb classes (Resnik 1993; Prescher, Riezler, and Rooth 2000; Kohomban and Lee 2005).",
        "The application where adjectives have received most attention, however, is Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis (Pang and Lee 2008), as adjectives are known to convey much of the evaluative and subjective information in language (Wiebe et al. 2004).",
        "The typical goal of this kind of study has been to identify subjective adjectives and their orientation (positive, neutral, negative).",
        "This type of research, from pioneering work by Hatzivassiloglou and colleages (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1993, 1997; Hatzivassiloglou andWiebe 2000) to current research (de Marneffe, Manning, and Potts 2010), has thus focused on scalar adjectives, that is, adjectives like good and bad, which can be translated into values that can be ordered along a scale.",
        "These adjectives typically enter into antonymy relations (the semantic relation between good and bad), and in fact antonymy is the main organizing criterion for adjectives in WordNet (Miller 1998), the most widely used semantic resource in NLP.",
        "However, when examining a large scale lexicon, it becomes immediately apparent that there are many other types of adjectives that do not easily fit in a scale-based or antonymy-based view of adjectives (Alonge et al. 2000).",
        "Some examples are pulmonary, former, and foldable.",
        "It is not clear, for instance, whether it makes sense to ask for an antonym of pulmonary, or to establish a ?foldability?",
        "scale for foldable.",
        "These adjectives need a different treatment, and they are treated in terms of different semantic classes in this article.",
        "The semantic properties of adjectives can also be exploited in advanced NLP tasks and applications such as Question Answering, Dialog Systems, Natural Language Generation, or Information Extraction.",
        "For instance, from a sentence like This maimai is round and sweet, we can quite safely infer that the (invented) object maimai is a physical object, probably edible.",
        "This type of process could be exploited in, for instance, Information Extraction and ontology population, although to our knowledge this possibility has received but little attention (Malouf 2000; Almuhareb and Poesio 2004).",
        "As for polysemy, previous approaches to the automatic acquisition of semantic classes have mostly disregarded the problem, by biasing the experimental material to include monosemous words only, or by choosing an approach that ignores polysemy (Hindle 1990; Merlo and Stevenson 2001; Schulte im Walde 2006; Joanis, Stevenson, and James 2008).",
        "There are a few exceptions to this tradition, such as Pereira, Tishby, and Lee (1993), Rooth et al. (1999), and Korhonen, Krymolowski, and Marx (2003), who used soft clustering methods for multiple assignment to verb semantic classes (see Section 4.5).",
        "There is very little related work in empirical computational semantics in modeling regular polysemy.",

        "The figure clearly shows that, whereas relational adjectives tend to have a differentiated value distribution for many of the features, the values for the event-related class in general overlap with those of the qualitative class.",

        "These two features show that in general event-related adjectives appear less often than qualitative adjectives in pre-nominal position and tend to bear more complements.",
        "Both differences are presumably due to the fact that many event adjectives inherit the argument structure of the deriving verb, with arguments expressed via PPs, constituting heavier constituents that are placed after the head noun.",
        "This is but a slight tendency and it is not homogeneous through the class, however.",
        "The remaining features do not show differences between event and qualitative adjectives, but rather properties of relational adjectives.",
        "In addition to the properties that were already known, the figure shows that relational adjectives appear more often in definite NPs acting as preposition complements (graphs E and H).",
        "Thus, the typical syntactic context for a relational adjective is preposition + definite determiner + noun + relational adjective).",
        "This type of adjective also appears slightly more often with feminine head nouns, which could be due to the fact that, in Catalan, many abstract nouns ( f?",

        "are feminine, for morphological reasons.",
        "These nouns are often modified by relational adjectives to select for subtypes of the class of objects denoted by the nouns (McNally and Boleda 2004).",
        "Another difficulty in the distributional characterization of the event class is the fact that it is quite heterogeneous, due to the variation at the morphology?semantics interface discussed earlier.",
        "This can be traced in Figure 4 by the fact that for most of the features, the box of the event class is larger than the box of the other two classes, meaning that there is more variation within the event class than within the other two classes.",
        "Feature value distribution across classes qualitative (Q), event-related (E), and relational (R) for nine selected features (see Section 5.2 for the definition of these features).",
        "To sum up, morphological features can quite reliably spot event-related adjectives, but distributional information cannot.",
        "As a result, in the cases where morphology gives thewrong prediction, nothing can be done on the distributional side to remedy this.",
        "This results in the confusion of event-related and qualitative adjectives shown in Table 12.",
        "polysemous adjectives: There are 26 monosemous adjectives assigned to a polysemous class.",
        "One of the reasons for this overgeneration is the procedure followed.",
        "The procedure treats the decision on each of the basic classes as if they were all independent.",
        "Thus, the probability for an adjective being polysemous amounts to the product of the probabilities of the adjective belonging to each of the basic classes, as expressed in Equation (4) for two arbitrary given classes, A and B.",
        "Table 14 shows that the distribution of polysemous items predicted by Equation (4) is more similar to the distribution obtained with the best machine learning classifier",

        "The distribution is estimated from the frequency over the 210 adjectives in the gold standard, and shown as absolute numbers.",
        "Both Equation (4) and the ML classifier assign 19 adjectives to the QE polysemy type, although the gold standard contains only 7 QE adjectives.",
        "The equation predicts fewer QR adjectives than observed in the data, but in this case the classifier produces a similar number of QR adjectives than attested (22 vs. 23).",
        "Finally, the classifier produces more ER adjectives than observed and also than predicted by Equation (4), but in this case the numbers are so small that no clear tendencies can be observed.",
        "Thus, the procedure followed can be said to cause the overgeneration of items for the QE polysemy type, but it does not account for the other two polysemous classes.",
        "Further qualitative analysis on the overgenerated polysemous adjectives (corresponding to the middle-gray cells in Table 12; not reported because of space concerns) showed that different types of evidence motivate the inclusion of monosemous adjectives in two classes, causing them to be considered polysemous.",
        "This suggests that, because polysemous adjectives exhibit only partial or limited evidence of each class, the threshold for positive assignment to a class is lowered, resulting in the observed overgeneration.",
        "Recall that at the beginning of this section, when introducing themodel, we warned that it would be specially challenging to distinguish between noise and evidence for a given class.",
        "We have indeed found this to be a challenge.",

        "The second model (Figure 5(b); experiments in Section 5) treats polysemous words alike to those of the basic classes: Polysemous assignments result frommembership in two basic classes.",
        "As can be seen in the figure, there are two main differences between the models.",
        "First, the number of classes considered: Whereas the second model only considers n classes, in the general case the first model will need to consider",
        "Boleda, Schulte im Walde, and Badia Modeling Regular Polysemy in Catalan Adjectives Figure 5 The two models of regular polysemy tested in this article, assuming a simplified scenario with just two basic classes (A and B).",
        "The rows represent three different cases: one monosemous adjective of class A (MonosemousA), one monosemous adjective of class B (MonosemousB), and one polysemous adjective (PolysemousAB).",
        "The columns represent the classes assumed in each model: Three classes (a), or only two (b).",

        "classes (n monosemous classes plus",
        "polysemous classes, all the possible two-combinations of the monosemous classes).",
        "This formula assumes that only two-way regular polysemy is allowed, as in this article; polysemy across three or more classes would make the explosion of classes even worse.",
        "It is clear that the second model is easier to learn.",
        "The second difference concerns the way class assignments to polysemous words are carried out.",
        "In the first model, polysemous words are assigned to one single, independent class, whereas in the second they are assigned to each of the two basic classes that give rise to the regular polysemy.",
        "Recall that the motivation for the first model was that?given that regularly polysemous adjectives show a particular hybrid behavior?",
        "we could expect that polysemous adjectives could be characterized as differentiated classes.",
        "This expectation has clearly not been borne out.",
        "A further problemwith the first model it that it in principle allows for a polysemous class AB whose properties do not necessarily have anything to do with those of the basic classes A and B.",
        "The second model, in contrast, enforces that polysemous adjectives exhibit properties of each of the classes they participate in, which is both theoretically and empirically more adequate.",
        "For these reasons, we believe that the secondmodel is more suitable to represent regular polysemy than the first model.",
        "The second model is also not completely satisfactory, however.",
        "As discussed in the previous section, in the current implementation of the model the class assignments are assumed to be independent (though this need not be the case in other instantiations of the model).",
        "Also, in a way, it is at the opposite end of the scale with respect to the first model: Whereas in the first model polysemous adjectives do not need to have anything in common with the basic classes, in the second model a polysemous word is assumed to be just like any other word in each of the basic classes.",
        "For instance, a qualitative-relational adjective is assumed to function both as a full-fledged qualitative adjective and a full-fledged relational adjective.",
        "By their very nature, polysemous words will show only some evidence for each of the classes, as their occurrences (and thus their properties) will be distributed across the two classes.",
        "Therefore, they will be untypical members of at least one of the intervening classes.",
        " An alternative instantiation of the second model could use soft clustering (Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Rooth et al. 1999; Korhonen, Krymolowski, andMarx 2003), which assigns a probability to each of the classes and is thus not bound to a hard yes/no decision, as our approach does.",
        "From a theoretical point of view (and for many practical purposes such as dictionary construction), however, a distinction betweenmonosemous and polysemous words is desirable, which adds a further parameter to be optimized in a soft clustering setting.",
        "Overlapping clustering (Banerjee et al. 2005), which allows for membership in multiple clusters, avoids this difficulty.",
        "Both methods have the advantage that they do not assume independence of the decisions.",
        "The most serious problem for the experiments presented in this article, however, would presumably also be a problem for these settings: The fact that the skewed sense distribution of many words makes it difficult to distinguish evidence for a particular class from noise.",
        "In the soft clustering setting, for instance, it would be hard to distinguish whether 10% evidence for class A and 90% for class B corresponds to polysemy with a skewed distribution, to noise in the data, or simply to an untypical instance.",
        "To sum up, the main problem for the models presented in this article is that neither model can capture the distributional connection between P(AB) and P(A), either because AB and A are seen as unrelated atoms in the first place (first model), or because AB is diluted into A and B (second model).",
        "A more refined statistical approach that can model this interdependency is needed for further progress.",
        "Such a model should take into account both the differences of polysemous adjectives with respect to the other adjectives in the basic classes (first model) and their similarities (second model), thus directly capturing their hybrid behavior."

        "This article has tackled the automatic induction of semantic classes for Catalan adjectives, with a special emphasis on regular polysemy.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first time that such an endeavor has been carried out, as (1) related work on lexical acquisition has focused on verbs (and, to a lesser extent, nouns) and onmajor languages such as English and German; and (2) polysemy in general has been largely ignored in lexical acquisition, and regular polysemy has only been sparsely addressed in empirical computational semantics.",
        "We have explored the relationship between observable cues and semantic properties for adjectives, and, specifically, the morphology?semantics and syntax?semantics interfaces.",
        "We have showed that there is a systematic relation between the type of denotation of an adjective and its morphological and distributional properties.",
        "Our experiments have furthermore related the linguistic properties of adjectives as described in the literature to the information that can be extracted from linguistic resources, such as corpora or lexical databases.",
        "The presented results and analyses provide empirical support for the qualitative and relational classes, defined in theoretical work, and bring event-related adjectives into focus, a type of adjective that has been largely neglected in the literature.",
        "This article has focused on Catalan as a case study, but most of the properties discussed (predicativity, gradability, complementation patterns), as well as the types of polysemy explored, are relevant for a broader range of languages, specially Indo-European languages (Dixon and Aikhenvald 2004).",
        "The approach does not require deep-processing resources (full parsing, semantic tagging, semantic role labeling), which makes it useful for lesser-researched languages.",
        "Boleda, Schulte im Walde, and Badia Modeling Regular Polysemy in Catalan Adjectives The experiments show that a major bottleneck for our purposes is the definition of the classification itself: The machine learning results obtained have reached an upper bound, as the best classifier has achieved 69.1% accuracy (against a 51.0% baseline), and the human agreement is 68%.",
        "Thus, improvements in the computational task will need to be preceded by improvements in the agreement scores, that is, by a better and clearer definition of the classification and the classification task.",
        "We have shown that this is by no means a trivial issue.",
        "In fact, low inter-coder agreement scores are a problem for machine learning approaches to semantic and discourse-related phenomena in general.",
        "This is in contrast to tasks such as POS tagging or syntactic parsing, where relatively high inter-coder agreement scores are achieved.",
        "This state of affairs is probably due to the fact that semantic and pragmatic phenomena are much less well understood than morphological or syntactic phenomena.",
        "Our experiments have highlighted a number of problems with the current classification proposal.",
        "First, the distinction between event-related and qualitative adjectives.",
        "The event class cannot be distinguished from the qualitative class with the distributional information used in this article, and its members are not homogeneous.",
        "We have shown that factors such as the aspectual class of the deriving verb or the suffix of the deverbal adjective play a role in the semantic and syntactic behavior of these adjectives that should be further explored.",
        "Also, a crucial type of evidence remains to be explored, namely, the selectional preferences of adjectives.",
        "These may be a relevant clue to the differences between qualitative and event-related adjectives.",
        "The second main problem is the fact that the qualitative class contains adjectives that do not fit into the other classes, constituting a sort of ?catch-all?",
        "class.",
        "A natural extension for the work presented in this article would be to define a finer-grained categorization including the problematic cases discussed earlier.",
        "For instance, adjectives deriving from stative verbs could be distinguished from those deriving from active verbs, and different types of qualitative adjectives could be treated as different classes.",
        "As for regular polysemy, we have shown that polysemous adjectives exhibit a hybrid behavior, with properties from all the classes involved in each type of regular polysemy.",
        "We have empirically tested two models of the phenomenon aimed at exploiting this hybrid behavior.",
        "The first model treats polysemous words in terms of independent classes, and we have argued that it is not adequate, neither from a theoretical nor from an empirical perspective.",
        "The second model assumes that polysemous words belong to each of the basic classes participating in the regular polysemy.",
        "This model is more adequate than the first one, as it accounts for the properties of the basic classes found in polysemous words, but it fails to account for the differences between polysemous and monosemous words.",
        "To improve on the modeling of regular polysemy, we plan to move to token-based (word-in-context) models (Schu?tze 1998; Erk and Pado?",
        "2010), as opposed to type-based models as we have done in this article.",
        "This should in turn shed light into the problem of distinguishing between evidence for a particular class from noise, discussed previously.",
        "Finally, at a methodological level, we have illustrated how the broad coverage, large-scale, radically empirical approaches developed in computational linguistics can be of use to uncover phenomena and facts that are relevant for the study of language, providing complementary evidence to the analytic tools traditionally used by linguists.",
        "Most prominently, we have shown that (1) by randomly sampling the set of words to be analyzed, new or neglected phenomena emerge; (2) the feature representation typically used by machine learning algorithms provides an empirical handle to the linguistic properties of words that can be explored in different ways (e.g., to test hypotheses about the morphology-syntax and semantics-syntax interfaces); (3) machine learning",
        " experiments provide a framework for the systematic evaluation of different models of the phenomenon under study (in our case, both adjective classification and regular polysemy).",
        "Computational linguistic studies are also inherently limited in several aspects, such as the type of evidence that can be used or the ways in which it can be used.",
        "Despite these limitations, we believe that empirical computational linguistics approaches are a gold mine of new knowledge about language.",
