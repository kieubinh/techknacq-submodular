        "Recently, corpus-based computational analysis corroborated this observation, and Kurokawa, Goutte, and Isabelle (2009) apply it to statistical machine translation, showing that for an English-to-French MT system, a translation model trained on an English-translated-to-French parallel corpus is better than one trained on French-translated-to-English texts.",

        "We also demonstrate that the differences between the two LMs are not biased by content, but rather reflect differences on abstract linguistic features.",
        "Research in Translation Studies holds a dual view on translationese, the sub-language of translated texts.",
        "On the one hand, there is a claim for so-called translation universals, traits of translationese which occur in any translated text irrespective of the source language.",

        "to the target text, and therefore creates a sub-translationese, the result of a pair-specific encounter between two specific languages.",
        "If both these claims are true then language models based on translations from the source language should best fit target language reference sentences, and language models based on translations from other source languages should fit reference sentences to a lesser extent yet outperform originally written texts.",

        "Furthermore, such data can be automatically identified (see Section 2).",

        "Numerous studies suggest that translated texts are different from original ones.",
        "Gellerstam (1986) compares texts written originally in Swedish and texts translated from English into Swedish.",
        "He notes that the differences between them do not indicate poor translation but rather a statistical phenomenon, which he terms translationese.",
        "He focuses mainly on lexical differences, for example, less colloquialism in the translations, or foreign words used in the translations ?with new shades of meaning taken from the English lexeme?",
        "(page 91).",
        "Only later studies consider grammatical differences (see, e.g., Santos 1995).",
        "The features of translationese were theoretically organized under the terms laws of translation and translation universals.",
        "Toury (1980, 1995) distinguishes between two laws: the law of interference and the law of growing standardization.",
        "The law of interference pertains to the fingerprints of the source text that are left in the translation product.",
        "The law of standardization pertains to the effort to standardize the translation product according to existing norms in the target language (and culture).",
        "Interestingly, these two laws are in fact reflected in the architecture of statistical machine translation: Interference in the translation model and standardization in the language model.",
        "The combined effect of these laws creates a hybrid text that partly corresponds to the source text and partly to texts written originally in the target language, but in fact belongs to neither (Frawley 1984).",
        "Baker (1993, 1995, 1996) suggests several candidates for translation universals, which are claimed to appear in any translated text, regardless of the source language.",
        "These include simplification, the tendency of translated texts to simplify the language, the message or both; and explicitation, their tendency to spell out implicit utterances that occur in the source text.",
        "During the 1990s, corpora were used extensively to study translationese.",
        "For example, Al-Shabab (1996) shows that translated texts exhibit lower lexical variety (type-to-token ratio) and Laviosa (1998) shows that their mean sentence length is lower, as is their lexical density (ratio of content to non-content words).",
        "These studies, although not conclusive, provide some evidence for the simplification hypothesis.",
        "Baroni and Bernardini (2006) use machine learning techniques to distinguish between original and translated Italian texts, reporting 86.7% accuracy.",
        "They manage to abstract from content and perform the task using onlymorpho-syntactic cues.",
        "Ilisei et al. (2010) perform the same task for Spanish but enhance it theoretically in order to check the simplification hypothesis.",
        "They first use a set of features which seem to capture ?general?",
        "characteristics of the text (ratio of grammatical words to content words); they then add another set of features, each of which relates to the simplification hypothesis.",
        "Finally, they remove each ?simplification feature?",
        "in turn and evaluate its contribution to the classification task.",
        "The most informative features are lexical variety, sentence length, and lexical density.",
        "1 Preliminary results were published in Lembersky, Ordan, and Wintner (2011).",
        "This is an extended, revised version of that paper, providing fuller data and reporting on more language pairs.",
        "Some experiments (in particular, Section 4.2.3) are completely new, as is the bulk of the discussion in Section 5, including the human evaluation.",
        " van Halteren (2008) focuses on six languages from Europarl (Koehn 2005): Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.",
        "For each of these languages, a parallel six-lingual subcorpus is extracted, including an original text and its translations into the other five languages.",
        "The task is to identify the source language of translated texts, and the reported results are excellent.",
        "This finding is crucial: as Baker (1996) states, translations do resemble each other; in accordance with the law of interference, however, the study of van Halteren (2008) suggests that translation from different source languages constitute different sublanguages.",
        "As we show in Section 4.2, LMs based on translations from the source language outperform LMs compiled from non-source translations, in terms of both fitness to the reference set and improving MT.",
        "Kurokawa, Goutte, and Isabelle (2009) show that the direction of translation affects the performance of statistical MT.",
        "They train systems to translate between French and English (and vice versa) using a French-translated-to-English parallel corpus, and then an English-translated-to-French one.",
        "They find that in translating into French it is better to use the latter parallel corpus, and when translating into English it is better to use the former.",

        "but rather indicate differences pertaining to the culture from which the speaker arrives.",
        "Most notable is the form ladies and gentlemen, which is the tenth most frequent trigram in T, but does not even rank among the top 100 in O.",
        "This is already noted by van Halteren",
        " (2008), according to whom this form is significantly more frequent in translations from five European languages as opposed to original English.",
        "In terms of (shallow) syntactic structure, we observe that part-of-speech n-grams are distributed somewhat differently in O and in T (we use the POS-tagged Europarl corpus of Section 4.1.2 for the following analysis).",
        "For example, proper nouns are more frequent in O (ranking 7 among all POS 1-grams) than in T (rank 9).",
        "This has influence on longer n-grams: For example, the 3-gram PRP MD VB is 20% more frequent in O than in T. The sequence <S> PRP VBP is almost twice as frequent in O.",
        "The 4-gram IN DT NN </S> is 25% more frequent in O.",
        "In contrast, the 4-gram IN DT NNS IN is 15% more frequent in T than in O.",
        "A full analysis of such patterns is beyond the scope of this article.",
        "Summing up, T-based language models are more fluent and therefore yield better translation results for the following reasons: They are more cohesive, less influenced by structural differences between the languages, such as the under-representation of verbs in original English texts, and less prone to interference (i.e., they can break away from the original towards a more coherent model of the target language)."

        "Chen, Beeferman, and Rosenfeld (1998) examine the ability of perplexity to estimate the performance of speech recognition.",
        "They find that perplexity often does not correlate well with word-error rates.",
