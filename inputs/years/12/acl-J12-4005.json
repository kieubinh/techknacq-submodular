        "Given the limitations and the difficulties in obtaining an in-depth semantic representation of texts as a whole, most efforts have been focused on partial semantic representation using less expressive semantic formalisms, such as those that come under the umbrella of Description Logic variants, or on discarding the whole semantic interpretation task in order to focus on smaller (and easier) subtasks.",
        "This is the case, for instance, in Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) systems, which indicate the semantic relations that hold between a predicate and its associated participants and properties, the relations of which are drawn from a pre-specified list of possible semantic roles for that predicate or class of predicates.",

        "Most of these efforts are verb-centered and reduce role labeling to the roles played by entities around a predicate instantiated as a verb.",
        "At a finer level, there is the task of WSD, for example, assigning the most appropriate sense to each lexical unit of the text from a predefined lexical-semantic resource.",
        "Once again a catalogue of classes has to be used as a range for the assignment.1 In this case as well, despite its excessive finer granularity, WordNet is the most widely used reference.",
        "See Navigli (2009) for a recent survey.",
        "In this line of research, there has recently been a growing interest in going beyond verb-centered hypotheses to tackle the computational treatment of deverbal nominalizations (nouns derived from verbs), in order to move forward to the full comprehension of texts.",
        "Deverbal nominalizations are lexical units that contain rich semantic information equivalent to a clausal structure.",
        "Many recent studies have focused on the detection of semantic relations between pairs of nominals that belong to different Nominal Phrases (NPs), such as Task 4 of SemEval 2007 (Girju et al. 2009) and Task 8 of SemEval 2010 (Hendrickx et al. 2010), or between nominals taking part in noun compound constructions.",
        "In the latter case, they take into account a predefined set of semantic relations (Girju et al. 2005) or use verb paraphrases with prepositions (Task 9 of SemEval 2010 [Butnariu et al. 2010a, 2010b]).",
        "Although these works include nominalizations, they are not strictly focused on them but cover all type of nouns.",
        "Actually, most of the work studying only deverbal nominalizations is focused on their argument structure: Some authors focus on the detection of arguments within the NP headed by the nominalization (Hull and Gomez 2000; Lapata 2002; Gurevich et al. 2006; Pado?, Pennacchiotti, and Sporleder 2008; Surdeanu et al. 2008; Gurevich and Waterman 2009), whereas others center their attention on detecting the implicit arguments of the nominalizations which are outside the NP (Gerber and Chai 2010; Ruppenhofer et al. 2010).",
        "Among the former group, there are different approaches to the problem: Lapata (2002) and Gurevich and Waterman (2009) use probabilistic models, Hull and Gomez (2000) and Gurevich et al. (2006) develop heuristic rules, Pado?, Pennacchiotti, and 1 Some approaches simply discriminate between different senses for a case without assigning it to a predefined specific class, however.",

        "The kind of argument annotated is also different in these works: Although only two, more syntactic labels (subj [subject] and obj [object]), are used to annotate the arguments in Lapata (2002), Gurevich et al. (2006), and Gurevich and Waterman (2009), Pado?, Pennacchiotti, and Sporleder (2008) use FrameNet labels and Surdeanu et al. (2008) use NomBank (Meyers, Reeves, and Macleod 2004)2 labels.",
        "The interpretation of nominalizations is crucial because they are common in texts and an important amount of information is representedwithin them.",
        "In the AnCora-ES corpus (Taule?, Mart?",
        "?, and Recasens 2008), for instance, the semantic information is mostly coded in verbs (56,590 verbal occurrences) but a significant number of deverbal nominalizations (23,431 occurrences) also encode rich semantic information.",
        "Most of the work on this topic sets out from the denotative distinction between nominalizations referring to an event, those that express an action or a process, and nominalizations referring to a result, those expressing the outcome of an action or process.",
        "From a theoretical point of view, it is stated that this denotative distinction may have repercussions on the argument-taking capability of deverbal nominalizations.",
        "Despite being aware of this distinction, computational approaches focus on event nominalizations, not taking into account the result ones or, more frequently, without characterizing the difference.",
        "For instance, SRL systems are mostly applied to event nominalizations (Pradhan et al. 2004; Erk and Pado?",
        "2006; Liu and Ng 2007).",
        "Result nominalizations are more frequent than the event types, however, at least in Spanish (1,845 event occurrences in contrast to 20,037 result occurrences in AnCora-ES).",
        "In the present work, we hypothesize that result nominalizations, like event nominalizations, can take arguments; therefore, discarding result nominalizations would imply a loss of semantic information, equally relevant to text representation.",

        "Concretely, we aim to determine the relevant linguistic information required to classify deverbal nominalizations as event or result types in Spanish.",
        "In order to achieve this goal, we have built an automatic classifier of deverbal nominalizations?the ADN-Classifier?for Spanish, aimed at identifying the semantic denotation of these nominal predicates (Peris et al. 2010).",
        "The ADN-Classifier is a tool that takes into account different levels of linguistic information depending on its availability, such as senses, lemmas, or syntactic and semantic information coded in the verbal and nominal lexicons (AnCora-Verb [Aparicio, Taule?, and Mart??",
        "2008] and AnCora-Nom [Peris and Taule?",
        "2011]) or in the AnCora-ES corpus.",
        "Therefore, this article contributes to the semantic analysis of texts focusing on Spanish deverbal nominalizations, although the proposal presented could be extended to other Romance languages.",
        "We base our study on theoretical hypotheses that we analyze empirically, and as a result we have developed three new resources: 1) the ADN-Classifier, the first tool that allows for the automatic classification of deverbal nouns as event or result nominalizations; 2) the AnCora-ES corpus enriched with the annotation of deverbal nominalizations according to their semantic denotation, the only Spanish corpus that incorporates this information; and 3) AnCora-Nom, a lexicon of deverbal nominalizations containing information about denotation types and argument structure.",

        " Resolution tasks it would be useful to have the nominalizations classified into denotations in order to detect coreference types.",

        "In the linguistics literature related to nominalizations, one of the most studied and controversial topics is the denotative distinction between event and result nominalizations.",
        "By event nominalization we mean those nouns that denote an action or process in the same way that a verb does.",
        "In other words, as their verbal counterparts, event nominalizations have the aspectual property of dynamicity (Example (7)).",
        "In contrast, a result nominalization refers to the state (Example (9)) or the concrete or abstract object resulting from the event (Example (8)).",
        "Both types of result nominalizations (states and",
        "objects) lack the aspectual property of dynamicity.",

        "?as.",
        "?The upward trend<result> of the euro has been reinforced in recent days.?",
        "In Example (7), the noun adaptacio?n (?adaptation?)",
        "denotes an event because it expresses an action in the same way that a verb does (it is equivalent to El proyecto americano consiste en adaptar la novela Paper Boy, ?The American project consists of adapting the Paper Boy novel?).",
        "The event interpretation is characterized as dynamic because it implies a change from ?not being adapted?",
        "to ?being adapted.?",
        "In contrast, in Example (8) the same nominalization is understood as a result because it denotes a specific object that is the outcome of the action of adapting a creative work into a film.",
        "In Example (9), the result interpretation is due to the fact that the verb base of tendencia, ?trend,?",
        "denotes a state, so the noun inherits the property of stativity (non-dynamicity) and does not imply any change.",
        "In this sense, our notions of event and result are equivalent to the complex-event and result nominalizations, respectively, in the terminology of Grimshaw (1990)3 or the terms process and result used in Pustejovsky (1995)4 and Alexiadou (2001).",
        "Although the event vs. result distinction we make is widespread, it is true that event and result nominalizations can also be represented in a more fine-grained way.",
        "For instance, Eberle, Faasz, and Heid (2009) distinguish between events (messung, ?measurement?",
        "), states (teilung, ?division?",
        "), and objects (lieferung, ?furnished material?)",
        "in German nominalizations, and Balvet, Barque, and Mar?",
        "?n (2010) propose a typology of French nominalizations that contemplates four aspectual types: states (admiration, ?admiration?",
        "), durative events (ope?ration, ?operation?",
        "), punctual events (explosion, ?explosion?",
        "), and objects (ba?timent, ?building?).",
        "For English, Levi (1978) identifies four types of nominalizations: actions (parental refusal), which are equivalent to the event notion; agents ( financial",
        " analyst), which denote the agent of an action and are characterized by using a different set of suffixes; products (human error), which denote the result of an action; and patients (student's inventions), which denote the patient object of the action.",
        "Also for English, Nunes (1993) defines five types of nominalizations: process nouns, that name the action or process denoted by the base verb (The documents?",
        "destruction by the North); result nouns, that denote a new creation resulting from the base verb (The invention was put on display); accumulated-action nouns, that name the sum total of a verb activity (The attack was unexpected); experiential-state nouns, nominalized stative verbs or nominalizations of a state brought about by a particular verb (Sam's interest in maths); and experiential-state results, the result counterpart of the previous class (Sam has many interests).",
        "The authors working on this topic mainly differ on two issues.",
        "On the one hand, they do not agree on how to consider (and therefore, how to represent) these two denotations: as two senses of the same lexical unit (Pustejovsky 1995; Badia 2002; Alonso 2004) or as two different lexical units (Grimshaw 1990; Picallo 1999; Alexiadou 2001).",
        "Regarding this denotative distinction, several linguistic criteria have been proposed in order to identify each of these denotations, mostly for English, although there are some proposals for Spanish (Picallo 1999), French, Greek, Russian, and Polish (Alexiadou 2001) (see Table 2 in Section 4.1).",
        "On the other hand, authors differ on the argument-taking capacity of deverbal nominalizations: Some linguists maintain that only event deverbal nominalizations can take arguments (Zubizarreta 1987; Grimshaw 1990), whereas others consider that both event and result nominalizations can take arguments (Pustejovsky 1995; Picallo 1999; Alexiadou 2001).",
        "Authors who conceptualize event and result nominalizations as different lexical units justify this in different ways.",
        "Grimshaw (1990) considers that only complex-event nominals legitimate an argument structure, and that constitutes the main difference with respect to result nominalizations which, according to her, lack argument structure.",
        "In Alexiadou (2001) and Picallo (1999), the idea that event and result nominalizations are different lexical units is justified by the different functional projection of these two types of nominalization and by word-formation at different levels of the language,5 respectively.",
        "In contrast to Grimshaw, however, they state that both types of nominalizations can select arguments.",
        "In the words of Alexiadou (2001, page 69): ?Given that there is no lexical difference between verbs and process nouns, and between result and process nouns, apart from the functional domain, all can take arguments.?",
        "Picallo also believes that complements of result nominalizations are arguments when argumental relationships can be established between them and the nominal head.",
        "In contrast, those who consider both denotations as senses of the same lexical unit maintain that nominalizations are underspecified lexical units (Pustejovsky 1995), units in which a disjunction of meaning is present (Alonso 2004), or simply lexical units with different senses (Badia 2002).",
        "Specifically, Pustejovsky accounts for the event-result ambiguity in nominalizations bymeans of an underspecified lexical representation called dot-object, arguing that event-result nominalizations are cases of complementary polysemy: ?both senses of a logically polysemous noun seem relevant for the interpretation of the noun in the context, but one sense seems ?focused?",
        "for purposes of a particular context?",
        "(Pustejovsky 1995, page 31).",
        "In relation to argument-taking capacity, both types of nominalizations are argumental because the dot-object representation has an argument structure in which the nominal arguments are specified.",
        "5 In Picallo (1999) it is stated that event nominalizations are created in the syntax whereas result nominalizations are created in the lexicon; therefore they have different derivation processes.",
        "Peris, Taule?, and Rodr?",
        "?guez Empirical Methods for the Study of Denotation in Nominalizations Alonso (2004) argues that these nominalizations present a disjunction of meaning because they can update an event and a result reading in the same sentence without the understanding of the sentence being affected.",
        "For instance, declaracio?n (?declaration?)",
        "in Example (10)6 can be interpreted as an event and as a result at the same time: Only event nominalizations can be said to have an initial moment and only result nominalizations can be said to have five pages.",
        "These two senses both originate in the same lexical unit, which includes both, and the context provides both meanings.",
        "(10) La declaracio?n<event/result> que el juez tomo?",
        "al testigo, que comenzo?",
        "a las once, ocupa cinco folios.",
        "?The statement<event/result> that the judge took from the witness, which began at eleven, takes up five pages.?",
        "Regarding argument-taking capacity, Alonso maintains that all nominalizations taking part in a support-verb construction can select arguments.",
        "So, if a result nominalization is part of a support-verb construction, it will also have argument structure.",
        "Following these authors, we also consider that result nominalizations can take arguments.",
        "Within a computational framework, there are different models that represent nominalizations; not all of them take into account the event and result distinction, however.",
        "For instance, in NomBank (Meyers, Reeves, and Macleod 2004) this distinction is completely ignored and the authors focus on argument structure.",
        "In contrast, Spencer and Zaretskaya (1999) label each nominal sense with one of the Grimshaw semantic categories (i.e., complex event, simple event, and result).",
        "Their database contains information about 7,000 Russian verbs and their 5,000 corresponding nominalizations, distinguishing between the verbal entries that nominalize the whole event while preserving the verbal argument structure, and those that denote a concrete or abstract result of the verb.",

        "?n 2010) annotates French deverbal nominalizations in the French TreeBank (Abeille?, Cle?ment, and Kinyon 2000) with one of the four classes proposed in their work (i.e., states, durative events, punctual events, and objects).",
        "In the middle ground between these two positions, we find the representation models proposed in WordNet (Fellbaum 1998), FrameNet (Baker, Fillmore, and Lowe 1998; Ruppenhofer et al. 2006), and Ontonotes (Hovy et al. 2006).",
        "WordNet, possibly due to its extremely fine granularity, usually includes among the senses corresponding to deverbal nouns one paraphrased as ?the acting of verb x?",
        "(our event nominalization) and another paraphrased to something similar to ?the thing X-verb+ed?",
        "(our result nominalization).",
        "FrameNet distinguishes between deverbal nominalizations defined as the action or process of X verb and nominalizations defined as entities.",
        "Concerning nouns, Ontonotes is interested in the disambiguation of noun senses in order to create an ontology.",
        "Within deverbal nouns the authors distinguish between nominalization senses that truly inherit the verb meaning and deverbal noun senses whose denotation is not directly related to the verb meaning.7 That is, they distinguish between two different types of deverbal nouns but this distinction is not akin to the event-result one.",
        "The distinctions established in WordNet and FrameNet are more similar to the one proposed in OntoNotes.",
        "To sum up, the event vs. result distinction in deverbal nominalizations has received much attention in linguistics literature.",
        "It seems to be less relevant in the computational",

        "As well as experimenting with AnCora-Nom-R1 simple features, we experimented with the binarization8 and grouping9 of several of them to address sparseness problems.",
        "Furthermore, with these experiments the foundations of the automatic classification system, the ADN-Classifier-R1, were laid (see step 3 in Figure 1).",
        "See Section 6 for a description of the ADN-Classifier.",

        "To do so, wemodified the (sense-based) model of classification underlying the ADN-Classifier-R1 (see step 2 in Figure 1) creating a new model able to carry out the more realistic task of classifying the occurrences in the whole AnCora-ES corpus.",
        "This new model (see step 5 in Figure 1) uses the following as knowledge resources: 1) the AnCora-Verb lexicon to obtain the features from the verbs related to nominalizations; 2) the complete AnCora-ES corpus (500kw); and 3) AnCora-Nom-R2, an extended lexicon of nominalizations without denotation types obtained automatically (see step 4 in Figure 1).",

        "The 3,077 occurrences were classified into 1,121 senses considering that different denotations associated with a lemma are different senses.",
        "Henceforth, we refer to them as nominalization senses.",

        "Two of the main sources of error found in the performance of the ADN-Classifier are data sparseness of some of the features (such as PP agent) and the fact that there are criteria at the disposal of human annotators that the ADN-Classifier is unable to detect.",
        "In order to reduce the problem of data sparseness it would be interesting to look for some linguistic generalizations of the sparse features in order to implement a backoff mechanism.",
        "Another line of future work is to analyze the criteria used by human annotators and not currently implemented either in the lexicon or in the corpus.",
        "Some additional features could be incorporated in the Classifier.",
        "Among them are path-based syntactic patterns that have been applied with success to related tasks (see Gildea and Palmer 2002).",
        "We have also experimented with a meta-classifier working on the results of binary classifiers (one for each class).",
        "The global accuracy of the meta-classifier was not greater than that of the current ADN.",
        "We think, however, that a binary classifier for the underspecified type (the most difficult one) could result in improvements.",
        "Most of the considerations regarding the scenarios described in Table 4 are based on a crude global evaluation of complementary NL processors such as a word sense disambiguator; for",
        " example, a specific scenario can be followed when the global accuracy of the NL processor crosses a given threshold.",
        "A more precise approach can also be adopted.",
        "Consider, for instance, the WSD task instead of a simple classifier providing a global accuracy?a regressor can provide individual scores of accuracy for each case (degree of confidence, margin, probability of correct classification, etc.).",
        "This more precise approach can lead to new scenarios incorporating hybrid models.",
        "The last point of future work consists in analyzing to what extent the ADN-Classifier and its models are applicable to other languages.",
        "Concretely, because we have a similar corpus for Catalan (lacking deverbal nominalization information) we plan to apply the models learned for Spanish to this closely related Romance language."
