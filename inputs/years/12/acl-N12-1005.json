        "where K feature functions (fk) are weighted by a set of coefficients (?k), and Z is a normalizing factor.",
        "The phrase-based approach differs from other approaches by the hidden variables of the translation process: the segmentation of a parallel sentence pair into phrase pairs and the associated phrase alignments.",
        "This formulation was introduced in (Zens et al., 2002) as an extension of the word based models (Brown et al., 1993), then later motivated within a discriminative framework (Och and Ney, 2004).",
        "One motivation for integrating more feature functions was to improve the estimation of the translation model P (t|s), which was initially based on relative frequencies, thus yielding poor estimates.",
        "This is because the units of phrase-based models are phrase pairs, made of a source and a target phrase; such units are viewed as the events of discrete random variables.",
        "The resulting representations of phrases (or words) thus entirely ignore the morphological, syntactic and semantic relationships that exist among those units in both languages.",
        "This lack of structure hinders the generalization power of the model and reduces its ability to adapt to other domains.",
        "Another consequence is that phrase-based models usually consider a very restricted context1.",
        "This is a general issue in statistical Natural Language Processing (NLP) and many possible remedies have been proposed in the literature, such as, for instance, using smoothing techniques (Chen and Goodman, 1996), or working with linguistically enriched, or more abstract, representations.",
        "In statistical language modeling, another line of research considers numerical representations, trained automat",
        "(Collobert et al., 2011)).",
        "An influential proposal, in this respect, is the work of (Bengio et al., 2003) on continuous space language models.",
        "In this approach, n-gram probabilities are estimated using a continuous representation of words in lieu of standard discrete representations.",
        "Experimental results, reported for instance in (Schwenk, 2007) show significant improvements in speech recognition applications.",
        "Recently, this model has been extended in several promising ways (Mikolov et al., 2011; Kuo et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2011).",
        "In the context of SMT, Schwenk et al. (2007) is the first attempt to estimate translation probabilities in a continuous space.",
        "However, because of the proposed neural architecture, the authors only consider a very restricted set of translation units, and therefore report only a slight impact on translation performance.",
        "The recent proposal of (Le et al., 2011a) seems especially relevant, as it is able, through the use of class-based models, to handle arbitrarily large vocabularies and opens the way to enhanced neural translation models.",
        "In this paper, we explore various neural architectures for translation models and consider three different ways to factor the joint probability P (s, t) differing by the units (respectively phrase pairs, phrases or words) that are projected in continuous spaces.",
        "While these decompositions are theoretically straightforward, they were not considered in the past because of data sparsity issues and of the resulting weaknesses of conventional maximum likelihood estimates.",
        "Our main contribution is then to show that such joint distributions can be efficiently computed by neural networks, even for very large context sizes; and that their use yields significant performance improvements.",
        "These models are evaluated in a n-best rescoring step using the framework of n-gram based systems, within which they integrate easily.",
        "Note, however that they could be used with any phrase-based system.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "We first recollect, in Section 2, the n-gram based approach, and discuss various implementations of this framework.",
        "We then describe, in Section 3, the neural architecture developed and explain how it can be made to handle large vocabulary tasks as well as language models over bilingual units.",
        "We finally report, in Section 4, experimental results obtained on a large-scale English to French translation task.",
        "2 Variations on the n-gram approach Even though n-gram translation models can be integrated within standard phrase-based systems (Niehues et al., 2011), the n-gram based framework provides a more convenient way to introduce our work and has also been used to build the baseline systems used in our experiments.",
        "In the n-gram based approach (Casacuberta and Vidal, 2004; Marin?o et al., 2006; Crego and Marin?o, 2006), translation is divided in two steps: a source reordering step and a translation step.",
        "Source reordering is based on a set of learned rewrite rules that non-deterministically reorder the input words so as to match the target order thereby generating a lattice of possible reorderings.",

        "The resulting BLEU score is here slightly worse than the one obtained with just the in-domain TM, yet delivering improved results with the respect to the baseline.",
        "In a last attempt, we amended the training regime of the neural network.",
        "In a fist step, we trained conventionally a SOUL model using the same out-of-domain parallel data as before.",
        "We then adapted this model by running five additional epochs of the back-propagation algorithm using the in-domain data.",
        "Using this adapted model yielded our best results to date with a BLEU improvement of 1.6 points over the baseline results.",

        "To the best of our knowledge, the first work on machine translation in continuous spaces is (Schwenk et al., 2007), where the authors introduced the model referred here to as the the standard n-gram translation model in Section 2.1.",
        "This model is an extension of the continuous space language model of (Bengio et al., 2003), the basic unit is the tuple (or equivalently the phrase pair).",
        "The resulting vocabulary being too large to be handled by neural networks without a structured output layer, the authors had thus to restrict the set of the predicted units to a 8k short-list .",
        "Moreover, in (Zamora-Martinez et al., 2010), the authors propose a tighter integration of a continuous space model with a n-gram approach but only for the target LM.",
        "A different approach, described in (Sarikaya et al., 2008), divides the problem in two parts: first the continuous representation is obtained by an adaptation of the Latent Semantic Analysis; then a Gaussian mixture model is learned using this continuous representation and included in a hidden Markov model.",
        "One problem with this approach is the separation between the training of the continuous representation on the one hand, and the training of the translation model on the other hand.",
        "In comparison, in our approach, the representation and the prediction are learned in a joined fashion.",
        "Other ways to address the data sparsity issues faced by translation model were also proposed in the literature.",
        "Smoothing is obviously one possibility (Foster et al., 2006).",
        "Another is to use factored language models, introduced in (Bilmes and Kirchhoff, 2003), then adapted for translation models in (Koehn and Hoang, 2007; Crego and Yvon, 2010).",
        "Such approaches require to use external linguistic analysis tools which are error prone; moreover, they did not seem to bring clear improvements, even when translating into morphologically rich languages."

        "In this paper, we have presented possible ways to use a neural network architecture as a translation model.",
        "A first contribution was to produce the first large-scale neural translation model, implemented here in the framework of the n-gram based models, taking advantage of a specific hierarchical architecture (SOUL).",
        "By considering several decompositions of the joint probability of a sentence pair, several bilingual translation models were presented and discussed.",
        "As it turned out, using a factorization which clearly distinguishes the source and target sides, and only involves word probabilities, proved an effective remedy to data sparsity issues and provided significant improvements over the baseline.",
        "Moreover, this approach was also experimented within the systems we submitted to the shared translation task of the seventh workshop on statistical machine translation (WMT 2012).",
        "These experimentations in a large scale setup and for different language pair corroborate the improvements reported in this article.",
        "We also investigated various training regimes for these models in a cross domain adaptation setting.",
        "Our results show that adapting an out-of-domain SOUL TM is both an effective and very fast way to perform bilingual model adaptation.",
        "Adding up all these novelties finally brought us a 1.6 BLEU point improvement over the baseline.",
        "Even though our experiments were carried out only within the framework of n-gram basedMT systems, using such models in other systems is straightforward.",
        "Future work will thus aim at introducing them into conventional phrase-based systems, such as Moses (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "Given that Moses only implicitly uses n-gram based information, adding SOUL translation models is expected to be even more helpful."
