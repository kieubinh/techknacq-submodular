        "Spoken dialogue systems that can detect and adapt to user affect1 are fast becoming reality (Schuller et al., 2009b; Batliner et al., 2008; Prendinger and Ishizuka, 2005; Vidrascu and Devillers, 2005; Lee ?Now at Univ.",
        "Toronto: jdrummond@cs.toronto.edu 1We use affect for emotions and attitudes that affect how users communicate.",
        "Other speech researchers also combine concepts of emotion, arousal, and attitudes where emotion is not full-blown (Cowie and Cornelius, 2003).",
        "and Narayanan, 2005; Shafran et al., 2003).",
        "The benefits are clear: affect-adaptive systems have been shown to increase task success (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011a; D?Mello et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2008) or improve other system performance metrics such as user satisfaction (Liu and Picard, 2005; Klein et al., 2002).",
        "However, to date most affective systems researchers have focused either only on affect detection, or only on detecting and adapting to a single affective state.",
        "The next step is thus to develop and evaluate spoken dialogue systems that detect and respond to multiple affective states.",
        "We previously showed that detecting and responding to user uncertainty during spoken dialogue computer tutoring significantly improves task success (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011a).",
        "We are now taking the next step: incorporating automatic detection and adaptation to user disengagement as well, with the goal of further improving task success.",
        "We targeted user uncertainty and disengagement because manual annotation showed them to be the two most common user affective states in our system and both are negatively correlated with task success (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2009; Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011b).",
        "Thus, we hypothesize that providing appropriate responses to these states would reduce their frequency, consequently improving task success.",
        "Although we address these user states in the tutoring domain, spoken dialogue researchers across domains and applications have investigated the automatic detection of both user uncertainty (e.g. (Drummond and Litman, 2011; PonBarry and Shieber, 2011; Paek and Ju, 2008; Alwan et al., 2007)) and user disengagement (e.g., (Schuller",
        "et al, 2010; Wang and Hirschberg, 2011; Schuller et al., 2009a)), to improve system performance.",
        "The detection of user disengagement in particular has received substantial attention in recent years, due to growing awareness of its potential for negatively impacting commercial applications (Wang and Hirschberg, 2011; Schuller et al., 2009a).",
        "In this paper we present a model for automatically detecting user disengagement during spoken dialogue interactions.",
        "Intrinsic evaluation of our model yields results on par with those of prior work.",
        "However, we argue that while intrinsic evaluations are necessary, they aren't sufficient when immediate implementation is the goal, because there is no a priori way to know when the model's performance is acceptable to use in a working system.",
        "This problem is particularly relevant to affect detection because it is such a difficult task, where no one achieves near-perfect results.",
        "We argue that for such tasks some extrinsic evaluation is also necessary, to show that the automatic labels are useful and/or are a reasonable substitute for a gold standard before undertaking a labor-intensive and time-consuming evaluation with real users.",
        "Here we use correlational analyses to show that our automatic disengagement labels are related to system performance in the same way as the gold standard (manual) labels.",
        "We further show through regression analyses that detecting user disengagement adds value over and above detecting only user uncertainty when modeling performance.",
        "These results provide strong evidence that enhancing a spoken dialogue system to detect and adapt to multiple affective states (specifically, user disengagement and uncertainty) has the potential to significantly improve performance even in the presence of noise due to automatic detection, when compared with only adapting to one affective state or ignoring affect entirely."

        "Our focus in this paper is on first using machine learning to develop a detector of user disengagement for spoken dialogue systems, and then evaluating its usefulness as fully as possible prior to its implementation and deployment with real users.",
        "Disengaged users are highly undesirable in human-computer interaction because they increase the potential for user dissatisfaction and task failure; thus over the past decade there has already been substantial prior work focused on detecting user disengagement and the closely related states of boredom, motivation and lack of interest (e.g., (Schuller et al., 2010; Wang and Hirschberg, 2011; Jeon et al., 2010; Schuller et al., 2009a; Bohus and Horvitz, 2009; Martalo et al., 2008; Porayska-Pomsta et al., 2008; Kapoor and Picard, 2005; Sidner and Lee, 2003; Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011b)).",
        "Within this work, specific affect definitions vary slightly with the intention of being coherent within the application and domain and being relevant to the specific adaptation goal (Martalo et al., 2008).",
        "However, affective systems researchers generally agree that disengaged users show little involvement in the interaction, and often display facial, gestural and linguistic signals such as gaze avoidance, finger tapping, humming, sarcasm, et cetera.",
        "The features used to detect disengagement also vary depending on system domain and application.",
        "For example, Sidner & Lee (2003) are interested in modeling more natural and collaborative human-robot interactions during basic conversations.",
        "They define an algorithm for the engagement process that involves appropriate eye gaze and turn-taking.",
        "Martalo et al. (2008) study how user engagement influences dialogue patterns during interactions with an embodied agent that gives advice about healthy dieting.",
        "They model engagement using manually coded dialogue acts based on the SWBDL-DAMSL scheme (Stolcke et al., 2000).",
        "Bohus and Horvitz (2009) study systems that attract and engage users for dynamic, multi-party dialogues in open-world settings.",
        "They model user intentions to engage the system with cues from facial sensors and the dialogue.",
        "Within recent spoken dialogue research, acoustic-prosodic, lexical and contextual features have been found to be effective detectors of disengagement (Schuller et al., 2010; Wang and Hirschberg, 2011; Jeon et al., 2010); we will briefly compare our own results with these in Section 5.",
        "While all of the above-mentioned research has presented intrinsic evaluations of their disengagement modeling efforts that indicate a reasonable degree of accuracy as compared to a gold standard (e.g., manual coding), only a few have yet demonstrated that the model's detected values are useful",
        "in practice and/or are a reasonable substitute for the gold standard with respect to some practical objective (e.g., a relationship to performance).",
        "In particular, two studies (Bohus and Horvitz, 2009; Schuller et al., 2009a) have gone directly from intrinsic evaluation of (dis)engagement models to performing user studies with the implemented model, thereby bypassing other less expensive and less labor-intensive means of extrinsic evaluation to quantify their model's usefulness?and potentially indicate its need to be further improved?before deployment with real users.",
        "Neither study reports statistically significant improvements in system performance as a result of detecting user (dis)engagement.",
        "Finally, while substantial spoken dialogue and affective systems research has shown that users display a range of affective states while interacting with a system (e.g. (Schuller et al., 2009b; Conati and Maclaren, 2009; Batliner et al., 2008; Devillers and Vidrascu, 2006; Lee and Narayanan, 2005; Shafran et al., 2003; Ang et al., 2002)), to date only a few affective systems have been built that detect and adapt to multiple user affective states (e.g., (D?Mello et al., 2010; Aist et al., 2002; Tsukahara andWard, 2001)), and most of these have been deployed with crucial natural language processing components ?wizarded?",
        "by a hidden human agent (e.g., who performs speech recognition or affect annotation on the user turns); moreover, none have yet shown significant improvements in system performance as a result of adapting to multiple user affective states."

        "Thus for both our automatically detected DISE labels (auto) and our gold standard DISE labels (manual), we first computed the total number of occurrences for each student, and then computed a bivariate Pearson's correlation between this total and two different metrics of performance: learning gain (LG) and user satisfaction (US).",

        "As shown, both automatic affect metrics have the same weight in the final model.",
        "This result suggests that adapting to our automatically detected disengagement and uncertainty labels can further improve learning over and above adapting to uncertainty alone.",
        "Although the final model's predictive power is low (R2=0.15), our interest here is only in investigating whether the two affective states are more useful in combination than in isolation for predicting performance.",
        "In similar types of stepwise regressions on prior ITSPOKE corpora, we?ve shown that more complete models of system performance incorporating many predictors of learning (i.e. affective states in conjunction with other dialogue features) can yield R2 values of over .5 (Forbes-Riley et al., 2008).16 15Using the stepwise method, Automatic DISE was the first feature selected, and Automatic UNC the second.",

        "We showed through intrinsic evaluations (i.e., cross-validation experiments using gold-standard labels) that the model yields results on par with prior work.",
        "We then showed crucially through novel extrinsic evaluation that the resulting automatically detected disengagement labels correlate with two primary performance metrics (user satisfaction and learning) in the same way as gold standard (manual) labels.",
        "This suggests that adapting to the automatic disengagement labels has the potential to significantly improve performance even in the presence of noise from the automatic labeling.",
        "Finally, further extrinsic analyses using multiple regression suggest that adapting to our automatic disengagement labels can improve learning (though not user satisfaction) over and above the improvement achieved by only adapting to automatically detected user uncertainty.",
