        "It is often necessary to split a long document into topically continuous segments.",
        "Segmentation may be particularly beneficial when working with documents without overt structure: speech transcripts (Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006), newswire (Misra et al., 2011) or novels (Kazantseva and Szpakowicz, 2011).",
        "The customary approach is to cast text segmentation as a binary problem: is there a shift of topic between any two adjacent textual units (e.g., sentences or paragraphs)?",
        "While necessary, this simplification is quite crude.",
        "Topic in discourse usually changes continually; some shifts are subtle, others ?",

        "In addition to topic changes per se, annotators effectively must classify some rhetorical and pragmatic phenomena ?",
        "exactly how much it is depends on the document genre.",

        "In fact, only about 50% of all annotated topical shifts are supported by at least 50% of annotators (including near-hits), while the other half is only marked by a minority.",
        "In this work we take the agreement about a certain topical shift as a measure of its prominence, and show how this measure can be simply utilized for the purpose of evaluation.",
        "The main claim of this paper is perhaps the following: when evaluating the performance of automatic segmenters, it is important to consider not only the overall similarity between human and machine segmentations, but also to examine the regions of disagreement.",
        "When a program misses or misplaces a prominent topic shift ?",

        "about identifying topically continuous segments.",
        "While the theoretical correctness of such usage remains questionable, it is sufficient for the purpose of our discussion, and it is in line with the literature on the topic.",

        "Passonneau and Litman (1997) describe an experiment where seven untrained annotators were asked to find discourse segments in a corpus of transcribed narratives about a movie.",
        "While the authors show that the agreement is significant, they also note that people include segment boundaries at different rates.",
        "Gruenstein, Niekrasz, and Purver (2005) describe the process of annotating parts of two corpora of meeting transcripts: ICSI (Janin et al., 2003) and ISL (Burger, MacLaren, and Yu, 2002).",
        "Two people annotated the texts at two levels: major and minor, corresponding to the more and less important topic shifts.",
        "Topical shifts were to be annotated so as to allow an outsider to glance at the transcript and get the gist of what she missed.",
        "Not unlike our work, the authors report rather low overall inter-annotator agreement.",
        "Galley et al. (2003) also compiled a layer of annotation for topical shifts for part of the ICSI corpus, using a somewhat different procedure with three annotators.",
        "Malioutov and Barzilay (2006) created a corpus of course lectures segmented by four annotators, noting that the annotators operated at different levels of granularity.",
        "In these three projects, manual annotations were compiled into a single gold standard reference for use in evaluating and fine-tuning automatic segmenters.",
        "The work described in this paper is different in several ways.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is",
        "the first attempt to annotate literary texts for topical shifts.",
        "Because we collected relatively many annotations for each chapter (four to six), we can make some generalizations as to the nature of the process.",
        "In addition to compiling and describing the corpus, we analyze disagreement patterns between annotators.",
        "We claim that even though the annotators may not agree on granularity, they do agree at some level, at least with respect to most prominent breaks.",
        "We propose that instead of compiling a single reference from multiple annotations it may be more useful to evaluate automatic segmenters against several annotations at once.",

        "None of the segmenters requires training in the conventional sense, but APS and MinCutSeg seg-meters come with scripts allowing to fine-tune several parameters.",

        "We have described a new corpus which can be used in research on topical segmentation.",
        "The corpus is compiled for fiction, a genre for which no such corpus exists.",
        "It contains a reasonable number of annotations per chapter to allow an in-depth analysis of topical segmentation as performed by humans.",
        "Our analysis of the corpus confirms the hypothesis that when asked to find topical segments, people operate at different levels of granularity.",
        "We show that only a small percentage of segment boundaries is agreed upon by all or almost all annotators.",
        "If, however, near-hits are considered, suggested segment boundaries can be ranked by their prominence using the information about how many people include each boundary in their annotation.",
        "We propose a simple modification to windowDiff which allows for taking into account more than one reference segmentation, and thus rewards or penalizes the output of automatic segmenters by considering the severity of their mistakes.",
        "The proposed metric is not trouble-free.",
        "It is a window-based metric so its value depends on the choice of the window size.",
        "While it has become a convention to set the window size to half of the average segment length in the reference segmentation, it is not obvious that the same logic applies in case of multi-annotator windowDiff.",
        "The metric also hides whether false positives or false negatives are the main source of error.",
        "All these shortcomings notwithstanding, the metric offers an advantage of allowing the evaluation of hypothetical segmentations with more subtlety than those using a single gold standard reference.",
        "When using regular windowDiff and a single reference segmentation, one is restricted to an evaluation based on binary comparisons: whether a given hypothetical boundary is similar to the gold standard segmentation (e.g., the majority opinion).",
        "Divergent segmentations are penalized even if they are similar to minority opinions (and thus feasible, though maybe less likely) or if they are completely different from anything created by humans (and thus probably genuinely erroneous).",
        "Our version of windowDiff, however, takes into account multiple annotations and gives partial reward to segmentations based on how similar there are to any human segmentation, not just the majority opinion (while giving preference to high agreement with the majority opinion).",
        "To evaluate the output of topical segmenters is hard.",
        "There is disagreement between the annotators about the appropriate level of granularity and about the exact placement of segment boundaries.",
        "The task itself is also a little vague.",
        "Just as it is the case in automatic text summarization, generation and other advanced NLP tasks, there is no single correct answer and the goal of a good evaluation metric is to reward plausible hypotheses and to penalize improbable ones.",
        "It is quite possible that a better metric than the one proposed here can be devised; see, for example, (Fournier and Inkpen, 2012)(Sca-iano and Inkpen, 2012).",
        "We feel, however, that any reliable metric for evaluating segmentations must ?",
        "in one manner or another ?",
        "take into account more than one annotation and the prominence of segment breaks."
