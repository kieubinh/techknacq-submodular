        "The responses include text and grammatical patterns (in all-cap labels representing parts-of-speech).",

        "where lexical items in square brackets are lemmas of potential translations) in a pop-up.",
        "TransAhead learns these constructs and translations during training.",
        "At run-time, TransAhead starts with a source sentence, and iterates with the user, making predictions on the grammar patterns and lexical translations, while adapting to the user's translation choices to resolve ambiguities in the source sentence related to word segmentation and word sense.",
