        "In this work, we evaluate a morphological analyser of Inuktitut, whose polysynthetic morphosyntax can cause particular problems for natural language processing; but our observations are also relevant to other languages with rich morphological systems.",
        "The existing NLP task for Inuktitut is that of word alignment (Martin et al., 2005), where Inuktitut tokens align to entire English clauses.",
        "While Langlais et al. (2005) theorises that a morphological analyser could aid in this task, we observed little to no improvement over a baseline model by making use of its segmentation.",
        "Nonetheless, morphological analysis does provide a great deal of information, but the task structure tends to disprefer its contribution."

        "Inuktitut is a macrolanguage of many more-or-less mutually intelligible dialects (Gordon, 2005).",
        "The morphosyntax of Inuktitut is particularly marked by a rich polysynthetic suffixing morphology, including incorporation of arguments into verbal tokens, as in natsiviniqtulauqsimavilli in (1).",
        "This phenomenon causes an individual token in Inuktitut to be approximately equivalent to an entire clause in English.",
        "?But have you ever eaten seal meat before??",
        "Lowe (1996) analyses the morphology as a four-place relationship: one head morpheme, zero or more lexical morphemes, one or more grammatical morphemes, and an optional enclitic.",
        "The morpho-tactics causes, amongst other phenomena, the final consonant of a morpheme to assimilate the manner of the initial consonant of the following morpheme (as in -villi), or to be dropped (as in natsiviniq-).",
        "Consequently, morphemes are not readily accessible from the realised surface form, thereby motivating the use of a morphological analyser."

        "Another typical approach is to perform morphological analysis at the same time as POS tagging (as in Hajic?",
        "and Hladka?",
        "(1998) for the fusional morphology in Czech), as it is often the case that",
        "determining the part-of-speech and choosing the appropriate inflectional paradigm are closely linked.",
        "For highly inflecting languages more generally, morphological analysis is often treated as a segment-and-normalise problem, amenable to analysis by weighted finite state transducer (wFST), for example, Creutz and Lagus (2002) for Finnish."

        "The challenge of the morphology becomes apparent when we contrast these figures with the types: about 416K for Inuktitut, but only 27K for English.",

        "Our approach examines morphological preprocessing of the Inuktitut training and test sets, with the idea of leveraging the morphological information into a corpus which is more amenable to alignment.",
        "The raw corpus appears to be under-segmented, where data sparseness from the many singletons would prevent reliable alignments.",

        "For other languages with rich morphology, it may be similarly valuable to target substantives for segmentation to improve alignment.",

        "Numerous common morphemes have no English equivalent, for example, -liaq- ?to go to?",
        "which seems to act as a light verb, or -niq-, a (re-)nominaliser for abstract nominals.",
        "While the output of the morphological analyser could probably be used more effectively in other tasks, there are still important impacts in word alignment and machine translation, including leveraging a dictionary (which is based on morphemes, not tokens, and as such requires segmentation and normalisation) or considering grammatical forms for syntactic approaches."
