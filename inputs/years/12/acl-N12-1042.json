        "Humans use speech to communicate what's on their mind.",
        "However, until now, automatic speech recognizers (ASR) and dialogue systems have had no direct way to take into account what is going on in a speaker's mind.",
        "Some work has attempted to infer cognitive states from volume and speaking rate to adapt language modeling (Ward and Vega, 2009) or from query click logs (Hakkani-Tu?r et al., 2011) to detect domains.",
        "A new way to address this limitation is to infer mental states from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals.",
        "EEG is a voltage signal that can be measured on the surface of the scalp, arising from large areas of coordinated neural activity.",
        "This neural activity varies as a function of development, mental state, and cognitive activity, and EEG can measurably detect such variation.",
        "Recently, a few companies have scaled back medical grade EEG technology to create portable EEG headsets that are commercially available and simple to use.",
        "The NeuroSky MindSetTM (2009), for example, is an audio headset equipped with a single-channel EEG sensor.",
        "It measures the voltage between an electrode that rests on the forehead and electrodes in contact with the ear.",
        "Unlike the multichannel electrode nets worn in labs, the sensor requires no gel or saline for recording, and requires no expertise to wear.",
        "Even with the limitations of recording from only a single sensor and working with untrained users, Furthermore, Mostow et al(2011) used its output signal to distinguish easy from difficult reading, achieving above-chance accuracy.",
        "Here we build on that work by using the output of such classifiers to adapt language models for ASR and thereby improve recognition accuracy.",
        "The most similar work is Jou and Schultz's (2008) use of electromyographic (EMG) signals generated by human articulatory muscles in producing speech.",
        "They showed that augmenting acoustic features with these EMG features can achieve rudimentary silent speech detection.",
        "Pasley et al. (2012) used electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings from nonprimary auditory cortex in the human superior temporal gyrus to reconstruct acoustic information in speech sounds.",
        "Our work differs from these efforts in that we use a consumer-grade single-channel EEG sensor measuring frontal lobe activities, and that we use the detected mental state just to help improve ASR performance rather than to dictate or reconstruct speech, which are much harder tasks.",
        "Section 2 describes how to use machine learning to distinguish mental states associated with easy and difficult readings.",
        "Section 3 describes how we use EEG classifier output to adapt ASR language models.",
        "Section 4 uses an oracle simulation to show how increasing EEG classifier accuracy will affect ASR accuracy.",
