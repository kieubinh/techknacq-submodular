        "There is growing interest in methods that incorporate human domain knowledge in machine learning algorithms, either as priors on model parameters or as constraints in an objective function.",
        "Such approaches lend themselves well to natural language tasks, where input features are often discrete variables that carry semantic meaning (e.g., words).",
        "A feature label is a simple but expressive form of domain knowledge that has received considerable attention recently (Druck et al., 2008; Melville et al., 2009).",
        "For example, a single feature (word) can be used to indicate a particular label or set of labels, such as ?excellent??",
        "positive or ?terrible??",
        "negative, which might be useful word-label rules for a sentiment analysis task.",
        "Contemporary work has also focused on making such learning algorithms active, by enabling them to pose ?queries?",
        "in the form of feature-based rules to be labeled by annotators in addition to ?",
        "and sometimes lieu of ?",
        "data instances such as documents (Attenberg et al., 2010; Druck et al., 2009).",
        "These concepts were recently implemented in a practical system for interactive training of text classifiers called DUALIST1.",
        "Settles (2011) reports that, in user experiments with real annotators, humans were able to train near state of the art classifiers with only a few minutes of effort.",
        "However, there were only five subjects, who were all computer science researchers.",
        "It is possible that these positive results can be attributed to the subjects?",
        "implicit familiarity with machine learning and natural language processing algorithms.",
        "This short paper sheds more light on previous experiments by replicating them with many more human subjects, and of a different type: non-experts recruited through the Amazon Mechanical Turk service2.",
        "We also analyze the impact of annotator be-havior on the resulting classifiers, and suggest relationships to recent work in curriculum learning."

        "Figure 1 shows a screenshot of DUALIST, an interactive machine learning system for quickly building text classifiers.",
        "The annotator is allowed to take three kinds of actions: ?",
        "label query documents (instances) by clicking class-label buttons in the left panel, ?",
        "label query words (features) by selecting them from the class-label columns in the right panel, or ?",
        "?volunteer?",

        "or ?, she labels queries that should help minimize the classifier's uncertainty on unlabeled documents (according to active learning heuristics).",
        "For action ?, the user is free to volunteer any relevant word, whether or not it appears in a document or word column.",

        "positive in a sentiment analysis task for movie reviews (leveraging her knowledge of domain), even if the word ?oscar?",

        "We recruited annotators through the crowdsourcing marketplace Mechanical Turk.",
        "Subjects were shown a tutorial page with a brief description of the classification task, as well as a cartoon of the interface similar to Figure 1 explaining the various annotation options.",
        "When they decided they were ready, users followed a link to a web server running a customized version of DUALIST, which is an open source web-based application.",
        "At the end of each trial, subjects were given a confirmation code to receive payment.",
        "We conducted experiments using two corpora from the original DUALIST study: Science (a subset of the 20 Newsgroups benchmark: cryptography, electronics, medicine, and space) and Movie Reviews (a sentiment analysis collection).",
        "These are not specialized domains, i.e., we could expect average Internet users to be knowledgable enough to perform the annotations.",
        "While both are generally accessible, these corpora represent different types of tasks and vary both in number of categories (four vs. two) and difficulty (Movie Reviews is known to be harder for learning algorithms).",
        "We replicated the same experimental conditions as previous work: DUALIST (the full interface in Figure 1), active-doc (the left-hand ?",
        "document panel only), and passive-doc (the ?",
        "document panel only, but with texts selected at random and not queried by active learning).",
        "For each condition, we recruited 25 users for the Science corpus (75 total) and 35 users for Movie Reviews (105 total).",
        "We were careful to publish tasks on MTurk in a way that no one user annotated more than one condition.",
        "Some users experienced technical difficulties that nullified their work, and four appeared to be spammers3.",
        "After removing these subjects from the analysis, we were left with 23 users for the Science DUALIST condition, 25 each for the two document-only conditions (73 total), 32 users for the Movie Reviews DUALIST condition, and 33 each for the document-only conditions (98 total).",
        "DUALIST automatically logged data about user actions and model accuracies as training progressed, although users could not see these statistics.",
        "Trials lasted 6 minutes for the Science corpus and 10 minutes for Movie Reviews.",
        "We did advertise a ?bonus?",
        "for the user who trained the best classifier to encourage correctness, but otherwise offered no guidance on how subjects should prioritize their time."

        "However, for Movie Reviews (bottom), there is little difference among the three settings, and in fact models trained with DUALIST appear to lag behind active learning with documents.",
        "Figure 2(b) shows the distribution of final classifier accuracies in each condition.",
        "For Science, the DUALIST users are significantly better than either of the baselines (two-sided KS test, p < 0.005).",
        "While the differences in DUALIST accuracies are not significantly different, we can see that the top quartile does much better than the two baselines.",
        "Clearly some DUALIST users are making better use of the interface and training better classifiers.",
        "How?",
        "It is important to note that users in the active-doc and passive-doc conditions can only choose action ?",
        "(label documents), whereas those in the DUALIST condition must allocate their time among three kinds of actions.",
        "It turns out that the annotators exhibited very non-uniform behavior in this respect.",
        "In particular, activity of action ?",
        "(volunteer labeled words) follows a power law, and many subjects volunteered no features at all.",
        "By inspecting the distribution of these actions for natural breakpoints, we identified three subgroups of DUALIST users: DV++ (many volunteered words), DV+ (some words), and DV- (none; labeled queries only).",
        "Note",
        "users in each behavioral subgroup of DUALIST subjects.",
        "that DV- is not functionally equivalent to the active-doc condition, as users in the DV- group could still view and label word queries.",
        "The three behavioral subgroups are summarized in Table 1.",
        "Figure 2(c) shows learning curves for these three groups.",
        "We can see that the DV++ and DV+ groups ultimately train better classifiers than the DV- group, and DV++ also dominates both the active and passive baselines from Figure 2(a).",
        "The DV++ group is particularly effective on the Movie Reviews corpus.",
        "This suggests that a user's choice to volunteer more labeled features ?",
        "by occasionally sidestepping the queries posed by the active learner and directly injecting their domain knowledge ?",
        "is a good predictor of classifier accuracy on this task.",
        "To tease apart the relative impact of other behaviors, we conducted an ordinary least-squares regression to predict classifier accuracy at the end of a trial.",
        "We included the number of user events for each ac",
        "tion as independent variables, plus two controls: the subject's document error rate in [0,1] with respect to the gold standard, and class entropy in [0, logC] of all labeled words (whereC is the number of classes).",
        "The entropy variable is meant to capture how ?balanced?",
        "a user's word-labeling activity was for actions?",
        "and?, with the intuition that a skewed set of words could confuse the learner, by biasing it away from categories with fewer labeled words.",
        "Table 2 summarizes these results.",
        "Surprisingly, query-labeling actions (?",
        "and ?)",
        "have a relatively small impact on accuracy.",
        "The number of volunteered words and entropy among word labels appear to be the only two factors that are somewhat significant: the former is strongest in the Movie Reviews corpus, the latter in Science4.",
        "Interestingly, there is a strong positive correlation between these two factors in the Movie Reviews corpus (Spearman's ?",
        "= 0.51, p = 0.02) but not in Science (?",
        "= 0.03).",
        "When we consider change in word label entropy over time, the Science DA++ group is balanced early on and becomes steadily more so on average , whereas DA+ goes for several minutes before catching up (and briefly overtaking) .",
        "This may account for DA+'s early dip in accuracy in Figure 2(c).",
        "For Movie Reviews, DA++ is more balanced than DA+ throughout the trial.",
        "DA++ labeled many words that were also class-balanced, which may explain why it is the best consistently-performing group.",
        "As is common in behavior modeling with small samples, the data are noisy and the regressions in Table 2 only explain 33%?46% of the variance in accuracy."

        "As interactive learning systems continue to expand the palette of interactive options (e.g., la-4Science has four labels and a larger entropy range, which might explain the importance of the entropy factor here.",

        "About half of those subjects alternated between extreme positive and negative instances in a relatively class-balanced way.",
        "This behavior was explained by showing that it is optimal under an assumption that, in reality, the learning task has many input features for which only one is relevant to the task.",

        "We argue that labeling features can be seen as a kind of training by curriculum.",
        "By volunteering labeled words in a class-balanced way (especially early on), a user provides clear, unambiguous training signals that effectively perform feature selection while biasing the classifier toward the user's hypothesis.",
        "Future research on mixed-initiative user interfaces might try to detect and encourage these kinds of annotator behaviors, and potentially improve interactive machine learning outcomes."
