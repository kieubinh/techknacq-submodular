        "Progress in natural language processing (NLP) research is driven and measured by automatic evaluation methods.",
        "Automatic evaluation allows fast and inexpensive feedback during development, and objective and reproducible evaluation during testing time.",
        "Grammatical error correction is an important NLP task with useful applications for second language learning.",
        "Evaluation for error correction is typically done by computing F1 measure between a set of proposed system edits and a set of human-annotated gold-standard edits (Leacock et al., 2010).",
        "Unfortunately, evaluation is complicated by the fact that the set of edit operations for a given system hypothesis is ambiguous.",
        "This is due to two reasons.",
        "First, the set of edits that transforms one string into another is not necessarily unique, even at the token level.",
        "Second, edits can consist of longer phrases which introduce additional ambiguity.",
        "To see how this can affect evaluation, consider the following source sentence and system hypothesis from the recent Helping Our Own (HOO) shared task (Dale and Kilgarriff, 2011) on grammatical error correction: Source : Our baseline system feeds word into PB-SMT pipeline.",

        ": Our baseline system feeds a word into PB-SMT pipeline.",
        "The HOO evaluation script extracts the system edit ( ?",
        "a), i.e., inserting the article a.",
        "Unfortunately, the gold-standard annotation instead contains the edits (word ?",
        "{a word, words}).",
        "Although the extracted system edit results in the same corrected sentence as the first gold-standard edit option, the system hypothesis was considered to be invalid.",
        "In this work, we propose a method, called MaxMatch (M2), to overcome this problem.",
        "The key idea is that if there are multiple possible ways to arrive at the same correction, the system should be evaluated according to the set of edits that matches the gold-standard as often as possible.",
        "To this end, we propose an algorithm for efficiently computing the set of phrase-level edits with the maximum overlap with the gold standard.",
        "The edits are subsequently scored using F1 measure.",
        "We test our method in the context of the HOO shared task and show that our method results in a more accurate evaluation for error correction.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the proposed method; Section 3 presents experimental results; Section 4 discusses some details of grammar correction evaluation; and Section 5 concludes the paper."
