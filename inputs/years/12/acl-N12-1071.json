        "Automatically identifying emotions expressed in text has a number of applications, including tracking customer satisfaction (Bougie et al., 2003), determining popularity of politicians and government policies (Mohammad and Yang, 2011), depression detection (Osgood and Walker, 1959; Pestian et al., 2008; Matykiewicz et al., 2009; Cherry et al., 2012), affect-based search (Mohammad, 2011), and improving human-computer interaction (Vela?squez, 1997; Ravaja et al., 2006).",
        "Supervised methods for classifying emotions expressed in a sentence tend to perform better than unsupervised ones.",
        "They use features such as unigrams and bigrams (Alm et al., 2005; Aman and Szpakow-icz, 2007; Neviarouskaya et al., 2009; Chaffar and Inkpen, 2011).",
        "For example, a system can learn that the word excruciating tends to occur in sentences la-beled with sadness, and use this word as a feature in classifying new sentences.",
        "Approaches that do not rely on supervised training with sentence-level annotations often use affect lexicons.",
        "An affect lexicon, in its simplest form, is a list of words and associated emotions and sentiments.",
        "For example, the word excruciating may be associated with the emotions of sadness and fear.",
        "Note that such lexicons are at best indicators of probable emotions, and that in any given sentence, the full context may suggest that a completely different emotion is being expressed.",
        "Therefore, it is unclear how useful such word-level emotion lexicons are for detecting emotions and meanings expressed in sentences, especially since supervised systems relying on tens of thousands of unigrams and bigrams can produce results that are hard to surpass.",
        "For example, it is possible that classifiers can learn from unigram features alone that excruciating is associated with sadness and fear.",
        "In this paper, we investigate whether word?",
        "emotion association lexicons can provide gains in addition to those already provided by ngram features.",
        "We conduct experiments with different affect lexicons and determine their usefulness in this extrinsic task.",
        "We also conduct experiments to determine how portable the ngram features and the emotion lexicon features are to a new domain."
