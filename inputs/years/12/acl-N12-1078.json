        "Given a parallel corpus, if two distinct words in language A, a1 and a2, are aligned to the same word b1 in language B, then this might signal that b1 is polysemous, or it might signal a1 and a2 are synonyms.",
        "Both assumptions with successful work have been put forward in the literature.",
        "We investigate these assumptions, along with other questions of word sense, by looking at sampled parallel sentences containing tokens of the same type in English, asking how often they mean the same thing when they are: 1. aligned to the same foreign type; and 2. aligned to different foreign types.",
        "Results for French-English and Chinese-English parallel corpora show similar behavior: Synonymy is only very weakly the more prevalent scenario, where both cases regularly occur."

        "1.",
        "Polysemy If two different words in language A are aligned to the same word in language B, then the word in language B is polysemous.",
        "2.",
        "Synonymy If two different words in language",
        "A are aligned to the same word in language B, then the two words in A are synonyms, and thus is not evidence of polysemy in B.",
        "Despite the alternate nature of these assumptions, both have associated articles in which a researcher claimed success.",
        "Under the polysemy assumption, Gale et al. (1992) used French translations as English sense indicators in the task of WSD.",
        "For instance, for the English word duty, the French translation droit was taken to signal its tax sense and devoir to signal its obligation sense.",
        "These French words were used as labels for different English senses.",
        "Similarly, in a cross-lingual WSD setting,1 Lefever et al. (2011) treated each English-foreign alignment as a so-called ParaSense, using it as a proxy for human labeled training data.",
        "Under the synonymy assumption, Diab and Resnik (2002) did word sense tagging by grouping together all English words that are translated into the same French word and by further enforcing that the majority sense for these English words was projected as the sense for the French word.",
        "Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005) applied the idea that French phrases aligned to the same English phrase are paraphrases in a system that induces paraphrases by pivoting through aligned foreign phrases.",
        "Based on this, and other successful prior work, it seems neither of the assumptions must hold universally.",
        "Therefore we investigate how often we might expect one or the other to dominate: we sample polysemous words from wide-domain {French,Chinese}-English corpora, and use Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to annotate word sense on the English side.",
        "We calculate empirical probabilities based on counting over the competing polysemous and synonymous scenario labels.",
        "A key factor deciding the validity of our conclusion is the reliability of the annotations derived via MTurk.",
        "Thus our first step is to evaluate the ability of Turkers to perform WSD.",
        "After verifying this 1E.g., given a sentence ?...",
        "more power, more duty ...?, the task asks to give a French translation of duty, which should be devior, after first recognizing the underlying obligation sense.",
        "as a reasonable process for acquiring large amounts of WSD labeled data, we go on to frame the experimental design, giving final results in Sec. 4."

        "Thus we first asked Turkers to re-annotate a sample of existing gold-standard data.",
        "With an eye towards costs saving, we also considered how many Turkers would be needed per item to produce results of sufficient quality.",

        "Two versions of the task were designed: 1. compare: given the same word in different sentences, tell whether their meaning is THE SAME, ALMOST THE SAME, UNLIKELY THE SAME or DIFFERENT, where the results were collapsed post-hoc into a binary same/different categorization; 2. sense map: map the meaning of a given word in a sentential context to its proper OntoNotes definition.",
