        "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is attractive for the learning of complex phenomena, for example, linguistic structure, where data annotation is expensive.",
        "Natural language processing applications have benefited from various SSL techniques, such as distributional word representations (Huang and Yates, 2009; Turian et al., 2010; Dhillon et al., 2011), self-training (McClosky et al., 2006), and entropy regularization (Jiao et al., 2006; Smith and Eisner, 2007).",
        "In this paper, we focus on semi-supervised learning that uses a graph constructed from labeled and unlabeled data.",
        "This framework, graph-based SSL?see Bengio et al. (2006) and Zhu (2008) for introductory material on this topic?has been widely used and has been shown to perform better than several other semi-supervised algorithms on benchmark datasets (Chapelle et al., 2006, ch.",
        "21).",
        "The method constructs a graph where a small portion of vertices correspond to labeled instances, and the rest are unlabeled.",
        "Pairs of vertices are connected by weighted edges denoting the similarity between the pair.",
        "Traditionally, Markov random walks (Szum-mer and Jaakkola, 2001; Baluja et al., 2008) or optimization of a loss function based on smoothness properties of the graph (Corduneanu and Jaakkola, 2003; Zhu et al., 2003; Subramanya and Bilmes, 2008, inter alia) are performed to propagate labels from the labeled vertices to the unlabeled ones.",
        "In this work, we are interested in multi-class generalizations of graph-propagation algorithms suitable for NLP applications, where each graph vertex can assume one or more out of many possible labels (Talukdar and Crammer, 2009; Subramanya and Bilmes, 2008, 2009).",
        "For us, graph vertices correspond to natural language types (not tokens) and undirected edges between them are weighted using a similarity metric.",
        "Recently, this setup has been used to learn soft labels on natural language types (say, word n-grams or syntactically disambiguated predicates) from seed data, resulting in large but noisy lexicons, which are used to constrain structured prediction models.",
        "Applications have ranged from domain adaptation of part-of-speech (POS) taggers (Subramanya et al., 2010), unsupervised learning of POS taggers by using bilingual graph-based projections (Das and Petrov, 2011), and shallow semantic parsing for unknown predicates (Das and Smith, 2011).",
        "However, none of the above captured the empirical fact that only a few categories typically associate with a given type (vertex).",
        "Take the case of POS tagging: Subramanya et al. (2010) construct a graph over trigram types as vertices, with 45 possible tags for the middle word of a trigram as the",
        "label set for each vertex.",
        "It is empirically observed that contextualized word types can assume very few (most often, one) POS tags.",
        "However, along with graph smoothness terms, they apply a penalty that encourages distributions to be close to uniform, the premise being that it would maximize the entropy of the distribution for a vertex that is far away or disconnected from a labeled vertex.",
        "To prefer maximum entropy solutions in low confidence regions of graphs, a similar entropic penalty is applied by Subramanya and Bilmes (2008, 2009).",
        "In this paper, we make two major algorithmic contributions.",
        "First, we relax the assumption made by most previous work (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002; Baluja et al., 2008; Subramanya and Bilmes, 2008; Subramanya and Bilmes, 2009; Subramanya et al., 2010; Das and Petrov, 2011; Das and Smith, 2011) that the `1 norm of the masses assigned to the labels for a given vertex must be 1.",
        "In other words, in our framework, the label distribution at each vertex is unnormalized?the only constraint we put on the vertices?",
        "vectors is that they must be nonnega-tive.1 This relaxation simplifies optimization: since only a nonnegativity constraint for each label's mass at each vertex needs to be imposed, we can apply a generic quasi-Newton method (Zhu et al., 1997).",
        "Second, we replace the penalties that prefer maximum entropy, used in prior work, with penalties that aim to identify sparse unnormalized measures at each graph vertex.",
        "We achieve this by penalizing the graph propagation objective with the `1 norm or the mixed `1,2 norm (Kowalski and Torre?sani, 2009) of the measures at each vertex, aiming for global and vertex-level sparsity, respectively.",
        "Importantly, the proposed graph objective functions are convex, so we avoid degenerate solutions and local minima.",
        "We present experiments on two natural language lexicon expansion problems in a semi-supervised setting: (i) inducing distributions of POS tags over n-gram types in the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank corpus (Marcus et al., 1993) and (ii) inducing distributions of semantic frames (Fillmore, 1982) over predicates unseen in anno-1Moreover, we also assume the edge weights in a given graph are unconstrained, consistent with prior work on graph-based SSL (Das and Petrov, 2011; Das and Smith, 2011; Subramanya and Bilmes, 2008; Subramanya and Bilmes, 2009; Subramanya et al., 2010; Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002).",
