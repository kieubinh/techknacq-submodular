        "Topic models are probabilistic graphical models meant to capture the semantic associations underlying corpora.",
        "Since the introduction of latent Dirichlet alocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), these models have been extended to account for more complex distributions over topics, such as adding supervision (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007), non-parametric priors (Blei et al., 2004; Teh et al., 2006), topic correlations (Li and McCallum, 2006; Mimno et al., 2007; Blei and Lafferty, 2006) and sparsity (Williamson et al., 2010; Eisenstein et al., 2011).",
        "While much research has focused on modeling distributions over topics, less focus has been given to the makeup of the topics themselves.",
        "This emphasis leads us to find two problems with LDA and its variants mentioned above: (1) independently generated topics and (2) overparameterized models.",
        "Independent Topics In the models above, the topics are modeled as independent draws from a single underlying distribution, typically a Dirichlet.",
        "This violates the topic modeling community's intuition that these distributions over words are often related.",
        "As an example, consider a corpus that supports two related topics, baseball and hockey.",
        "These topics likely overlap in their allocation of mass to high probability words (e.g. team, season, game, players), even though the two topics are unlikely to appear in the same documents.",
        "When topics are generated independently, the model does not provide a way to capture this sharing between related topics.",
        "Many extensions to LDA have addressed a related issue, LDA's inability to model topic correlation,1 by changing the distributions over topics (Blei and Lafferty, 2006; Li and McCallum, 2006; Mimno et al., 2007; Paisley et al., 2011).",
        "Yet, none of these change the underlying structure of the topic's distributions over words.",
        "Overparameterization Topics are most often parameterized as multinomial distributions over words: increasing the topics means learning new multinomials over large vocabularies, resulting in models consisting of millions of parameters.",
        "This issue was partially addressed in SAGE (Eisenstein et al., 2011) by encouraging sparsity in the topics which are parameterized by their difference in log-frequencies from a fixed background distribution.",
        "Yet the problem of overparameterization is also tied 1Two correlated topics, e.g. nutrition and exercise, are likely to co-occur, but their word distributions might not overlap.",
        "to the number of topics, and though SAGE reduces the number of non-zero parameters, it still requires a vocabulary-sized parameter vector for each topic.",
        "We present the Shared Components Topic Model (SCTM), which addresses both of these issues by generating each topic as a normalized product of a smaller number of underlying components.",
        "Rather than learning each new topic from scratch, we model a set of underlying component distributions that constrain topic formation.",
        "Each topic can then be viewed as a combination of these underlying components, where in a model such as LDA, we would say that components and topics stand in a one to one relationship.",
        "The key advantages of the SCTM are that it can learn and share structure between overlapping topics (e.g. baseball and hockey) and that it can represent the same number of topics in a much more compact representation, with far fewer parameters.",
        "Because the topics are products of components, we present a new training algorithm for the significantly more complex product case which relies on a Contrastive Divergence (CD) objective.",
        "Since SCTM topics, which are products of distributions, could be represented directly by distributions as in LDA, our goal is not necessarily to learn better topics, but to learn models that are substantially smaller in size and generalize better to unseen data.",
        "Experiments on two corpora show that our model uses fewer underlying multinomials and still achieves lower perplexity than LDA, which suggests that these constraints could lead to better topics."
