        "The motivation for this study was to confirm our suspicion that parsing models that performed well under one metric were likely to perform well under other metrics, thereby validating the widespread practice of using just a single metric when conducting research on improving parser performance.",
        "Our results are cautiously optimistic on this front.1 We use the problem of selecting the best performer from a large space of varied but related parse 1Note that we are not suggesting that these metrics provide redundant information for other uses, e.g. predicting utility for any particular downstream task.",

        "Analyses from the ERG consist of a syntax tree together with an underspecified logical formula called an MRS (Copestake et al., 2005).",
        "The parsers differ from each other along two dimensions: the feature templates employed, and the degree of regularization used.",
        "There are 57 different sets of traditional and novel feature templates collecting a variety of syntactic and semantic data about candidate ERG analyses.",
        "For each set of feature templates, parsers were trained with 41 different values for the quadratic regularization parameter, for a total of 2337 different parsers.",
        "TheWeScience Treebank of about 9100 sentences (Ytrest?l et al., 2009) was used both for training and testing the parsers, with 10-fold cross validation.",
        "We break down the problem of selecting the best parser into two tasks.",
        "The first task is to identify the optimal value for the regularization parameter for each set of feature templates.",
        "The second task is to compare the different sets of feature templates to each other, considering only the optimal value of the regularization parameter for each, and select the overall best.",
