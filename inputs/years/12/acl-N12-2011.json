        "The extraction of structured information from text is a long-standing challenge in Natural Language Processing which has been reinvigorated with the ever-increasing availability of user-generated textual content online.",
        "The large-scale extraction of unknown relations has been termed as Open Information Extraction (Open IE) (Banko et al., 2007) (also referred to as Open Relationship Extraction, Relation Extraction, or Relation Discovery).",
        "Many challenges exist in developing an Open IE solution, such as recognizing and disambiguating entities in a multi-document setting, and identifying all so-called relational terms 1This thesis proposal has been accepted for publication in (Merhav et al., 2012).",
        "in the sentences connecting pairs of entities.",
        "Relational terms are words (usually one or two) that describe a relation between entities (for instance, terms like ?running mate?, ?opponent?, ?governor of?",
        "are relational terms).",
        "One approach for Open IE is based on clustering of entity pairs to produce relations, as introduced by Hasegawa et al. (Hasegawa et al., 2004).",
        "Their and follow-up works (e.g., (Mesquita et al., 2010)) extract terms in a small window between two named entities to build the context vector of each entity pair, and then apply a clustering algorithm to cluster together entity pairs that share the same relation (e.g., Google?Youtube and Google?",
        "Motorola Mobility in a cluster about the ?acquired?",
        "relation).",
        "Contexts of entity pairs are represented using the vector space model.",
        "The state-of-the-art in clustering-based Open IE assigns weights to the terms according to the standard tf ?idf scheme.",
        "Motivation.",
        "Intuitively, the justification for using idf is that a term appearing in many documents (i.e., many contexts in our setting) would not be a good discriminator (Robertson, 2004), and thus should weigh proportionally less than other, more rare terms.",
        "For the task of relation extraction however, we are interested specifically in terms that describe relations.",
        "In our settings, a single document is a context vector of one entity pair, generated from all articles discussing this pair, which means that the fewer entity pairs a term appears in, the higher its idf score would be.",
        "Consequently, it is not necessarily the case that terms that are associated with high idf weights would be good relation discriminators.",
        "On the other hand, popular relational terms that ap",
        "ply to many entity pairs would have relatively lower idf weights.",
        "It is natural to expect that the relations extracted by an Open IE system are strongly correlated with a given context.",
        "For instance, marriage is a relation between two persons and thus belongs to the domain PER?PER.",
        "We exploit this observation to boost the weight of relational terms associated with marriage (e.g., ?wife?, ?spouse?, etc.)",
        "in those entity pairs where the domain is also PER?PER.",
        "The more dominant a term in a given domain compared to other domains, the higher its boosting score would be.",
        "Our work resembles the work on selectional preferences (Resnik, 1996).",
        "Selectional preferences are semantic constraints on arguments (e.g. a verb like ?eat?",
        "prefers as object edible things)."

        "Fully unsupervised Open IE systems are mainly based on clustering of entity pair contexts to produce clusters of entity pairs that share the same relations, as introduced by Hasegawa et al. (Hasegawa et al., 2004) (this is the system we use in this work as our baseline).",
