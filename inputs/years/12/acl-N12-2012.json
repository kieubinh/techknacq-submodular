        "Much has been written about humor and even sarcasm automatic recognition on Twitter.",
        "The task of classifying humorous tweets according to the type of humor has not been confronted so far, as far as we know.",
        "This research is aimed at applying classification and other NLP algorithms to the challenging task of automatically identifying the type and topic of humorous messages on Twitter.",
        "To achieve this goal, we will extend the related work surveyed hereinafter, adding different types of humor and characteristics to distinguish between them, including stylistic, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic ones.",
        "We will keep in mind the complex nature of the task at hand, which emanates from the informal language applied in tweets and variety of humor types and styles.",
        "These tend to be remarkably different from the type specific ones recognized in related works.",
        "We will use semi-supervised classifiers on a dataset of humorous tweets driven from different Twitter humor groups or funny tweet sites.",
        "Using a Mechanical Turk we will create a gold standard in which each tweet will be tagged by several annotators, in order to achieve an agreement between them, although the nature of the humor might allow one tweet to be classified under more than one class and topic of humor."

        "These may be found in such systems as Chatterbots, gaming and decision making.",
        "Humor is extremely important in any communicative form.",
        "It affects not only feelings but also influences human beliefs.",
        "It has even shown to encourage creativity.",
        "Enabling a machine to classify humor types (and topics) can have many practical applications, such as automatic humor subscriptions that send us only those messages that will make us laugh.",
        "It can serve as a basis for further research on humor generation of witty and adequate replies by conversational agent applications.",
        "We tend to expose more about ourselves in humor than in regular prose.",
        "In the next section we will highlight several research results from the fields of psychology and sociology that show this, and explore the differences in humor produced by different groups.",
        "This knowledge can be used to identify the latent attributes of the tweeters, e.g. gender, geographical location or origin and personality features based on their tweets.",
        "Aggressiveness in humor can be viewed as a potential warning sign and teach us about the authors mental well-being.",
        "We will now look at some examples of funny tweets from one of the sites, and then review the different types, topics and the way in which the human brain operates to get the joke.",

        "This makes it a wordplay joke that paraphrases a known phrase.",
        "But the main reason this is funny is the observation that a very common Face-book action is gay.",
        "Therefore, the type of this humor would be classified as observational and the topic Facebook.",

        "It is a tricky and complex task.",
        "We could parse the sentence to find out that the reader is advised to make someones cut sting, and we could use a semantic ontology or a lexicon to teach the computer that sting is a negative experience, which will lead to drawing the correct conclusion.",
        "We believe a comprehensive understanding of the sentence is not mandatory, but if necessary, we can use the work of Taylor (2010) as reference.",

        "Example (5) is an insult, and the topic is the proper name Jay Leno.",
        "This research will likely conclude that we prefer the human NE over the non-human one, when instructing the computer how to choose our topic.",
        "To recognize that this is an insult to Leno, we need to know he is a comedian, and that the tweet suggests that he is not funny.",
        "An internet search will discover the former.",
        "For the latter, we must understand what translate something into funny means.",
        "The semantics of the verb and its indirect object that follows the preposition into should clarify this.",
        "This can be achieved by parsing the tweet, looking up the semantics of translate and comedian in a semantic ontology, and concluding that Leno is not funny.",
        "This is contradictory to his profession and can be viewed as an insult.",

        "While the classification of different data, identifying whether tweets are humorous, sarcastic, or neither, has been examined closely in recent years, I am unaware of any research that has been done on automatic humor classification by type or topic.",
        "One of the first studies on computational humor was done by Binsted and Ritchie (1997), in which the authors modeled puns based on semantics and syntax.",
        "This work paved the way for humor generation research works, such as LIBJOG (Raskin and Attardo 1994), JAPE (Binsted and Ritchie 1994, 1997) and HA-HAcronym (Stock and Strapparava, 2003).",
        "The two former systems were criticized as pseudo-generative because of the template nature of their synthesized jokes.",
        "The latter is also very limited in its syntax.",
        "Only in later studies was the recognition of humor examined.",
        "Mihalcea and Strapparava (2005) used content and stylistic features to automatically recognize humor.",
        "This was done, however, on a more homogenous set of data, one-liners, that, unlike tweets, are formal, grammatically correct and often exhibit stylistic features, such as alliteration and antonyms, which seldom appear in tweets.",
        "Davi-dov et al. (2010) recognized sarcastic sentences in Twitter.",
        "They used a semi-supervised algorithm to acquire features that could then be used by the classifier to decide which data item was sarcastic.",
        "In addition to these lexical patterns, the classifier also used punctuation-based features (i.e. number of !).",

        "It was used as a basis for the Semantic Script-based Theory of Humour (SSTH) (Raskin 1985), and later on the General Theory of Verbal Humour (GTVH) (Attardo and Raskin 1991).",
        "Taylor (2010) found that the semantic recognition of humor is based on this theory and on humor data that support it.",
        "We can see that examples (1)-(5) in section 1 do not comply with this theory.",
        "It appears that some humorous statements can lack any incongruity.",
        "The superiority theory claims that humor is triggered by feelings of superiority with respect to ourselves or others from a prior event (Hobbes 1840).",
        "The relief theory views humor as a way out of taboo and a license for banned thoughts.",
        "Through humor the energy inhibited by social etiquette can be released and bring relief to both the author and audience.",
        "Freud, as early as 1905, supported this theory and connected humor to the unconscious (Freud, 1960).",
        "Minsky (1980) embraces the theory and observes the faulty logic in humor as another steam-releasing trait.",
        "Mihalcea (2006) enumerated the most discriminative content-based features learned by her humor classifier.",
        "The more substantial features were found to be human-centric vocabulary, professional communities and human weaknesses that often appear in humorous data.",
