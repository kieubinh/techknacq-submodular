        "Comment threads contain fascinating and useful insights into public reactions, but are challenging to read and understand without computational assistance.",
        "We present a tool for exploring large, community-created comments threads in an efficient manner.",
        "1 Introduction The comments made on blog posts and news articles provide both immediate and ongoing public reaction to the content of the post or article.",
        "When a given site allows users to respond to each other (?threaded?",
        "responses), the comment sets become a genuine public conversation.",
        "However, this information can be difficult to access.",
        "Comments are typically not indexed by search engines, the volume is often enormous, and threads may continue to be added to over months or even years.",
        "This makes it hard to find particular information of interest (say, a mention of a particular company in a set of thousands of YouTube comments), or to understand the gist of the discussion at a high-level.",
        "Our goal in this work was to create a simple tool which would allow people to rapidly ingest useful information contained in large community-created comment threads, where the volume of data precludes manual inspection.",
        "To this end, we created CoFi (Comment Filter), a language-independent, web-based interactive browser for single comment threads.",
        "2 How CoFi works For a given set of comments, we create a distinct CoFi instance.",
        "Each instance is over a natural data set, e.g. all comments from a particular discussion group, comments attached to an individual news article, or tweets resulting from a topical search.",
        "Creating a CoFi instance has three steps: harvesting the comments, clustering the comments, and responding to user interactions while they visualize and navigate (sorting and filtering) the dataset.",
        "2.1 Harvesting the data Our comments are harvested from individual web sites.",
        "These need not be in English, or even in a single language.",
        "Typically, sites use proprietary javascript to present comments.",
        "Each web site has a unique interface and formatting to serve the comments to web browsers, and there is no general purpose tool to gather comments everywhere.",
        "The CoFi approach has been to factor this part of the problem into one harvesting engine per web site.",
        "Some sites provide an API that simplifies the problem of harvesting comments that contain particular keywords.",
        "On other sites, there seems to be no reliable alternative to developer ingenuity when it comes to altering the harvesting engines to accommodate data formats.",
        "Thus, we note that the harvesting activity is only semi-automated.",
        "2.2 Clustering the data Once harvesting is complete, the rest of the process is automatic.",
        "Clusters are generated and labeled using a pipeline of machine learning tools.",
        "The open source package MALLET provides many of our document ingestion and clustering components (McCallum, 2002).",
        "Our processing components are language-independent and can be used with non-English or mixed language data sets.",
        "Specifically, we use a combination of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), K-Means clustering, and calculation of mutual information.",
        "LDA models each document (aka comment) as a mixture of latent topics, which are in turn comprised of a probability distribution over words (Chen, 2011, gives a good overview).",
        "It's an unsupervised algorithm that performs approximate inference.",
        "The topics it infers are the ones that best explain the statistical distributions of words observed in the",
        "At the bottom of the cluster lists, there is a View All Comments option.",
        "Sorting the entire set by relevance gives a good snapshot of most and least useful comments in the thread.",
        "From any of the views, clicking on a user name will display all comments from that user, and clicking on the comment ID will present that sub-thread; top-level comments are numbered X, while replies are la-beled X.X.",
        "The CoFi interface also allows the user to export individual comments, marking those comments as having been ?handled?",
        "and routed to a particular person.",
        "This makes it easier to incrementally process comments as they arrive.",
        "We have applied CoFi to 72 distinct data sets, including forum discussions, news article, blog and YouTube comments, Twitter and comments on regulatory changes submitted to government offices via Regulations.gov.",
        "These last documents are much longer than those CoFi was intended to han-dle, but CoFi was nonetheless able to support interesting analysis.",
        "In one instance, we identified a clear case of ?astroturfing?",
        "(fake grassroots movement) based on the CoFi clusters.",
        "Acknowledgements Over the course of this project, many people have supported our work.",
