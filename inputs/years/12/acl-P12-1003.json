        "Learning curves are routinely used to illustrate how the performance of experimental methods depend on the amount of training data used.",
        "In the SMT area, Koehn et al. (2003) used learning curves to compare performance for various meta-parameter settings such as maximum phrase length, while Turchi et al. (2008) extensively studied the behaviour of learning curves under a number of test conditions on Spanish-English.",
        "In Birch et al. (2008), the authors examined corpus features that contribute most to the machine translation performance.",
        "Their results showed that the most predictive features were the morphological complexity of the languages, their linguistic relatedness and their word-order divergence; in our work, we make use of these features, among others, for predicting translation accuracy (Section 4).",
        "In a Machine Learning context, Perlich et al. (2003) used learning curves for predicting maximum performance bounds of learning algorithms and to compare them.",
        "In Gu et al. (2001), the learning curves of two classification algorithms were modelled for eight different large data sets.",
        "This work uses similar a priori knowledge for restricting the form of learning curves as ours (see Section 3), and also similar empirical evaluation criteria for comparing curve families with one another.",
        "While both application and performance metric in our work are different, we arrive at a similar conclusion that a power law family of the form y = c ?",
        "a x??",
        "is a good model of the learning curves.",
        "Learning curves are also frequently used for determining empirically the number of iterations for an incremental learning procedure.",
        "The crucial difference in our work is that in the previous cases, learning curves are plotted a posteriori i.e. once the labelled data has become available and the training has been performed, whereas in our work the learning curve itself is the object of the prediction.",
        "Our goal is to learn to predict what the learning curve will be a priori without having to label the data at all (S1), or through labelling only a very small amount of it (S2).",
        "In this respect, the academic field of Computational Learning Theory has a similar goal, since it strives to identify bounds to performance measures1, typically including a dependency on the training sample size.",

        "The first condition just says that more training data is better.",
        "The second condition expresses a notion of ?diminishing returns?, namely that a given amount of additional training data is more advantageous when added to a small rather than to a big amount of initial data.",
        "The last condition is related to our use of BLEU ?",
        "which is bounded by 1 ?",

        "Here, we proposed methods that can be directly applied to predicting learning curves in realistic scenarios.",
        "We identified a suitable parametric family for modeling learning curves via an extensive empirical comparison.",
        "We described an inference method that requires a minimal initial investment in the form of only a small parallel test dataset.",
        "For the cases where a slightly larger in-domain ?seed?",
        "parallel corpus is available, we introduced an extrapolation method and a combined method yielding high-precision predictions: using models trained on up to 20K sentence pairs we can predict performance on a given test set with a root mean squared error in the order of 1 BLEU point at 75K sentence pairs, and in the order of 2-4 BLEU points at 500K.",
        "Considering that variations in the order of 1 BLEU point on a same test dataset can be observed simply due to the instability of the standard MERT parameter tuning algorithm (Foster and Kuhn, 2009; Clark et al., 2011), we believe our results to be close to what can be achieved in principle.",
        "Note that by using gold curves as labels instead of actual measures we implicitly average across many rounds of MERT (14 for each curve), greatly attenuating the impact of the instability in the optimization procedure due to randomness.",
        "For enabling this work we trained a multitude of instances of the same phrase-based SMT system on 30 distinct combinations of language-pair and domain, each with fourteen distinct training sets of increasing size and tested these instances on multiple in-domain datasets, generating 96 learning curves.",
        "BLEU measurements for all 96 learning curves along with the gold curves and feature values used for inferring the learning curves are available as additional material to this submission.",
        "We believe that it should be possible to use insights from this paper in an active learning setting, to select, from an available monolingual source, a subset of a given size for manual translation, in such a way at to yield the highest performance, and we plan to extend our work in this direction."
