        "Acoustic models are an indispensable component of speech recognizers.",
        "However, the standard process of training acoustic models is expensive, and requires not only language-specific knowledge, e.g., the phone set of the language, a pronunciation dictionary, but also a large amount of transcribed data.",
        "Unfortunately, these necessary data are only available for a very small number of languages in the world.",
        "Therefore, a procedure for training acoustic models without annotated data would not only be a breakthrough from the traditional approach, but would also allow us to build speech recognizers for any language efficiently.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised acoustic modeling with only spoken utterances as training data.",
        "As suggested in Garcia and Gish (2006), unsupervised acoustic modeling can be broken down to three sub-tasks: segmentation, clustering segments, and modeling the sound pattern of each cluster.",
        "In previous work, the three sub-problems were often approached sequentially and independently in which initial steps are not related to later ones (Lee et al., 1988; Garcia and Gish, 2006; Chan and Lee, 2011).",
        "For example, the speech data was usually segmented regardless of the clustering results and the learned acoustic models.",
        "In contrast to the previous methods, we approach the problem by modeling the three sub-problems as well as the unknown set of sub-word units as latent variables in one nonparametric Bayesian model.",
        "More specifically, we formulate a Dirichlet process mixture model where each mixture is a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) used to model a sub-word unit and to generate observed segments of that unit.",
        "Our model seeks the set of sub-word units, segmentation, clustering and HMMs that best represent the observed data through an iterative inference process.",
        "We implement the inference process using Gibbs sampling.",
        "We test the effectiveness of our model on the TIMIT database (Garofolo et al., 1993).",
        "Our model shows its ability to discover sub-word units that are highly correlated with standard English phones and to capture acoustic context information.",
        "For the segmentation task, our model outperforms the state-of",
        "the-art unsupervised method and improves the relative F-score by 18.8 points (Dusan and Rabiner, 2006).",
        "Finally, we test the quality of the learned acoustic models through a keyword spotting task.",
        "Compared to the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods (Zhang and Glass, 2009; Zhang et al., 2012), our model yields a relative improvement in precision of top hits by at least 22.1% with only some degradation in equal error rate (EER), and outperforms a language-mismatched acoustic model trained with supervised data."

        "the general guideline used in (Lee et al., 1988; Garcia and Gish, 2006; Chan and Lee, 2011) and approach the problem of unsupervised acoustic modeling by solving three sub-problems of the task: segmentation, clustering and modeling each cluster.",
        "The key difference, however, is that our model does not assume independence among the three aspects of the problem, which allows our model to refine its solution to one sub-problem by exploiting what it has learned about other parts of the problem.",
        "Second, unlike (Lee et al., 1988; Garcia and Gish, 2006) in which the number of sub-word units to be learned is assumed to be known, our model learns the proper size from the training data directly.",
        "Instead of segmenting utterances, the authors of (Varadarajan et al., 2008) trained a single state HMM using all data at first, and then iteratively split the HMM states based on objective functions.",
        "This method achieved high performance in a phone recognition task using a label-to-phone transducer trained from some transcriptions.",
        "However, the performance seemed to rely on the quality of the transducer.",
        "For our work, we assume no transcriptions are available and measure the quality of the learned acoustic units via a spoken query detection task as in Jansen and Church (2011).",
        "Jansen and Church (2011) approached the task of unsupervised acoustic modeling by first discovering repetitive patterns in the data, and then learned a whole-word HMM for each found pattern, where the state number of each HMM depends on the average length of the pattern.",
        "The states of the whole-word HMMs were then collapsed and used to represent acoustic units.",
        "Instead of discovering repetitive patterns first, our model is able to learn from any given data.",
        "Unsupervised Speech Segmentation One goal of our model is to segment speech data into small sub-word (e.g., phone) segments.",
        "Most unsupervised speech segmentation methods rely on acoustic change for hypothesizing phone boundaries (Scharenborg et al., 2010; Qiao et al., 2008; Dusan and Rabiner, 2006; Estevan et al., 2007).",
        "Even though the overall approaches differ, these algorithms are all one-stage and bottom-up segmentation methods (Scharenborg et al., 2010).",
        "Our model does not make a single one-stage decision; instead, it infers the segmentation through an iterative process and exploits the learned sub-word models to guide its hypotheses on phone boundaries.",
        "Bayesian Model for Segmentation Our model is inspired by previous applications of nonparametric Bayesian models to segmentation problems in NLP and speaker diarization (Goldwater, 2009; Fox et al., 2011); particularly, we adapt the inference method used in (Goldwater, 2009) to our segmentation task.",
        "Our problem is, in principle, similar to the word segmentation problem discussed in (Goldwater, 2009).",
        "The main difference, however, is that our model is under the continuous real value domain, and the problem of (Goldwater, 2009) is under the discrete symbolic domain.",

        "To conduct spoken term detection experiments on the TIMIT dataset, we computed a posteriorgram representation for both training and test feature frames over the 4Except when a cluster label is mapped to /vcl/ /b/, /vcl/ /g/ and /vcl/ /d/, where the duration of the release /b/, /g/, /d/ is almost always shorter than the closure /vcl/.",

        "For every keyword, spoken examples were extracted from the training set and were searched for in the test set using segmental dynamic time warping (Zhang and Glass, 2009).",
        "In addition to the supervised acoustic models, we also compare our model against the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods for this task (Zhang and Glass, 2009; Zhang et al., 2012).",
        "Zhang and Glass (2009) trained a GMM with 50 components to decode posteriorgrams for the feature frames, and Zhang et al. (2012) used a deep Boltzmann machine (DBM) trained with pseudo phone labels generated from an unsupervised GMM to produce a posteriorgram representation.",
        "The evaluation metrics they used were: 1) P@N, the average precision of the top N hits, where N is the number of occurrences of each keyword in the test set; 2) EER: the average equal error rate at which the false acceptance rate is equal to the false rejection rate.",
        "We also report experimental results using the P@N and EER metrics.",

        "from the TIMIT training set excluding the sa type utterances and the 48 phones used in TIMIT.",
        "Note that for clarity, we show only pairs that occurred more than 200 times in the alignment results.",
        "The average co-occurrence frequency of the mapping pairs in this figure is 431. correlation between the cluster labels and individual English phones.",
        "For example, clusters 19, 20 and 21 are mapped exclusively to the vowel /ae/.",
        "A more careful examination on the alignment results shows that the three clusters are mapped to the same vowel in a different acoustic context.",
        "For example, cluster 19 is mapped to /ae/ followed by stop consonants, while cluster 20 corresponds to /ae/ followed by nasal consonants.",
        "This context-dependent relationship is also observed in other English phones and their corresponding sets of clusters.",
        "Fig.",
        "4 also shows that a cluster may be mapped to multiple English phones.",
        "For instance, clusters 85 and 89 are mapped to more than one phone; nevertheless, a closer look reveals that these clusters are mapped to /n/, /d/ and /b/, which are sounds with a similar place of articulation (i.e. labial and dental).",
        "These correlations indicate that our model is able to discover the phonetic composition of a set of speech data without any language-specific knowledge.",
        "The performance of the four acoustic models on the spoken term detection task is presented in Table 2.",
        "The English triphone model achieves the best P@N and EER results and performs slightly better than the English monophone model, which indicates a correlation between the quality of an acoustic model and its performance on the spoken term detection task.",
        "Although our unsupervised model does not perform as well as the supervised English",
        "vised acoustic models on the spoken term detection task.",
        "acoustic models, it generates a comparable EER and a more accurate detection performance for top hits than the Thai monophone model.",
        "This indicates that even without supervision, our model captures and learns the acoustic characteristics of a language automatically and is able to produce an acoustic model that outperforms a language-mismatched acoustic model trained with high supervision.",
        "Table 3 shows that our model improves P@N by a large margin and generates only a slightly worse EER than the GMM baseline on the spoken term detection task.",
        "At the end of the training process, our model induced 169 HMMs, which were used to compute posteriorgrams.",
        "This seems unfair at first glance because Zhang and Glass (2009) only used 50 Gaussians for decoding, and the better result of our model could be a natural outcome of the higher complexity of our model.",
        "However, Zhang and Glass (2009) pointed out that using more Gaussian mixtures for their model did not improve their model performance.",
        "This indicates that the key reason for the improvement is our joint modeling method instead of simply the higher complexity of our model.",
        "Compared to the DBM baseline, our model produces a higher EER; however, it improves the relative detection precision of top hits by 24.3%.",
        "As indicated in (Zhang et al., 2012), the hierarchical structure of DBM allows the model to provide a descent posterior representation of phonetic units.",
        "Even though our model only contains simple HMMs and Gaussians, it still achieves a comparable, if not better, performance as the DBM baseline.",
        "This demonstrates that even with just a simple model structure, the proposed learning algorithm is able to acquire rich phonetic knowledge from data and generate a fine posterior representation for phonetic units.",

        "pre-segmentation (pre-seg) method.",
        "The language-independent pre-seg method is suitable for seeding our model.",
        "It eliminates most unlikely boundaries while retaining about 87% true boundaries.",
        "Even though this indicates that at best our model only recalls 87% of the true boundaries, the pre-seg reduces the search space significantly.",
        "In addition, it also allows the model to capture proper phone durations, which compensates the fact that we do not include any explicit duration modeling mechanisms in our approach.",
        "In the best semi-supervised baseline model (Qiao et al., 2008), the number of phone boundaries in an utterance was assumed to be known.",
        "Although our model does not incorporate this information, it still achieves a very close F-score.",
        "When compared to the baseline in which the number of phone boundaries in each utterance was also unknown (Dusan and Rabiner, 2006), our model outperforms in both recall and precision, improving the relative F-score by 18.8%.",
        "The key difference between the two baselines and our method is that our model does not treat segmentation as a standalone problem; instead, it jointly learns segmentation, clustering and acoustic units from data.",
        "The improvement on the segmentation task shown by our model further supports the strength of the joint learning scheme proposed in this paper."
