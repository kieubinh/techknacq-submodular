        "Automatic word alignment is a vital component of nearly all current statistical translation pipelines.",
        "Although state-of-the-art translation models use rules that operate on units bigger than words (like phrases or tree fragments), they nearly always use word alignments to drive extraction of those translation rules.",
        "The dominant approach to word alignment has been the IBM models (Brown et al., 1993) together with the HMM model (Vogel et al., 1996).",
        "These models are unsupervised, making them applicable to any language pair for which parallel text is available.",
        "Moreover, they are widely disseminated in the open-source GIZA++ toolkit (Och and Ney, 2004).",
        "These properties make them the default choice for most statistical MT systems.",
        "In the decades since their invention, many models have surpassed them in accuracy, but none has supplanted them in practice.",
        "Some of these models are partially supervised, combining unlabeled parallel text with manually-aligned parallel text (Moore, 2005; Taskar et al., 2005; Riesa and Marcu, 2010).",
        "Although manually-aligned data is very valuable, it is only available for a small number of language pairs.",
        "Other models are unsupervised like the IBM models (Liang et al., 2006; Grac?a et al., 2010; Dyer et al., 2011), but have not been as widely adopted as GIZA++ has.",
        "In this paper, we propose a simple extension to the IBM/HMM models that is unsupervised like the IBM models, is as scalable as GIZA++ because it is implemented on top of GIZA++, and provides significant improvements in both alignment and translation quality.",
        "It extends the IBM/HMM models by incorporating an `0 prior, inspired by the principle of minimum description length (Barron et al., 1998), to encourage sparsity in the word-to-word translation model (Section 2.2).",
        "This extension follows our previous work on unsupervised part-of-speech tagging (Vaswani et al., 2010), but enables it to scale to the large datasets typical in word alignment, using an efficient training method based on projected gradient descent (Section 2.3).",
        "Experiments on Czech-, Arabic-, Chinese-and Urdu-English translation (Section 3) demonstrate consistent significant improvements over IBM Model 4 in both word alignment (up to +6.7 F1) and translation quality (up to +1.4 Bleu).",
        "Our implementation has been released as a simple modification to the GIZA++ toolkit that can be used as a drop-in replacement for GIZA++ in any existing MT pipeline."
