        "Automatically describing images in natural language is an intriguing, but complex AI task, requiring accurate computational visual recognition, comprehensive world knowledge, and natural language generation.",
        "Some past research has simplified the general image description goal by assuming that relevant text for an image is provided (e.g., Aker and Gaizauskas (2010), Feng and Lapata (2010)).",
        "This allows descriptions to be generated using effective summarization techniques with relatively surface level image understanding.",
        "However, such text (e.g., news articles or encyclopedic text) is often only loosely related to an image's specific content and many natural images do not come with associated text for summarization.",
        "In contrast, other recent work has focused more on the visual recognition aspect by detecting content elements (e.g., scenes, objects, attributes, actions, etc) and then composing descriptions from scratch (e.g., Yao et al. (2010), Kulkarni et al. (2011), Yang et al. (2011), Li et al. (2011)), or by retrieving existing whole descriptions from visually similar images (e.g., Farhadi et al. (2010), Ordonez et al. (2011)).",
        "For the latter approaches, it is unrealistic to expect that there will always exist a single complete description for retrieval that is pertinent to a given query image.",
        "For the former approaches, visual recognition first generates an intermediate representation of image content using a set of English words, then language generation constructs a full description by adding function words and optionally applying simple re-ordering.",
        "Because the generation process sticks relatively closely to the recognized content, the resulting descriptions often lack the kind of coverage, creativity, and complexity typically found in human-written text.",
        "In this paper, we propose a holistic data-driven approach that combines and extends the best aspects of these previous approaches ?",
        "a) using visual recognition to directly predict individual image content elements, and b) using retrieval from existing human-composed descriptions to generate natural, creative, and inter",
        "esting captions.",
        "We also lift the restriction of retrieving existing whole descriptions by gathering visually relevant phrases which we combine to produce novel and query-image specific descriptions.",
        "By judiciously exploiting the correspondence between image content elements and phrases, it is possible to generate natural language descriptions that are substantially richer in content and more linguistically interesting than previous work.",
        "At a high level, our approach can be motivated by linguistic theories about the connection between reading activities and writing skills, i.e., substantial reading enriches writing skills, (e.g., Hafiz and Tudor (1989), Tsang (1996)).",
        "Analogously, our generation algorithm attains a higher level of linguistic sophistication by reading large amounts of descriptive text available online.",
        "Our approach is also motivated by language grounding by visual worlds (e.g., Roy (2002), Dindo and Zambuto (2010), Monner and Reggia (2011)), as in our approach the meaning of a phrase in a description is implicitly grounded by the relevant content of the image.",
        "Another important thrust of this work is collective image-level content-planning, integrating saliency, content relations, and discourse structure based on statistics drawn from a large image-text parallel corpus.",
        "This contrasts with previous approaches that generate multiple sentences without considering discourse flow or redundancy (e.g., Li et al. (2011)).",
        "For example, for an image showing a flock of birds, generating a large number of sentences stating the relative position of each bird is probably not useful.",
        "Content planning and phrase synthesis can be naturally viewed as constraint optimization problems.",
        "We employ Integer Linear Programming (ILP) as an optimization framework that has been used successfully in other generation tasks (e.g., Clarke and Lapata (2006), Martins and Smith (2009), Woodsend and Lapata (2010)).",
        "Our ILP formulation encodes a rich set of linguistically motivated constraints and weights that incorporate multiple aspects of the generation process.",
        "Empirical results demonstrate that our final system generates linguistically more appealing and semantically more correct descriptions than two nontrivial baselines."

        "For a query image, we retrieve relevant candidate natural language phrases by visually comparing the query image to database images from the SBU Captioned Photo Collection (Ordonez et al., 2011) (1 million photographs with associated human-composed descriptions).",
        "Visual similarity for several kinds of image content are used to compare the query image to images from the database, including: 1) object detections for 89 common object categories (Felzenszwalb et al., 2010), 2) scene classifications for 26 common scene categories (Xiao et al., 2010), and 3) region based detections for stuff categories (e.g. grass, road, sky) (Ordonez et al., 2011).",

        "Although not directly focused on image description generation, some previous work in the realm of summarization shares the similar problem of content planning and surface realization.",
        "There 8E.g., ?A desk on top of a cat?",
        "is grammatically correct, but cognitively absurd.",
        "are subtle, but important differences however.",
        "First, sentence compression is hardly the goal of image description generation, as human written descriptions are not necessarily succinct.9 Second, unlike summarization, we are not given with a set of coherent text snippet to begin with, and the level of noise coming from the visual recognition errors is much higher than that of starting with clean text.",
        "As a result, choosing an additional phrase in the image description is much riskier than it is in summarization.",
        "Some recent research proposed very elegant approaches to summarization using ILP for collective content planning and/or surface realization (e.g., Martins and Smith (2009), Woodsend and Lapata (2010), Woodsend et al. (2010)).",
        "Perhaps the most important difference in our approach is the use of negative weights in the objective function to create the necessary tension between selection (salience) and compatibility, which makes it possible for ILP to generate variable length descriptions, effectively correcting some of the erroneous vision detections.",
        "In contrast, all previous work operates with a predefined upper limit in length, hence the ILP was formulated to include as many textual units as possible modulo constraints.",
        "To conclude, we have presented a collective approach to generating natural image descriptions.",
        "Our approach is the first to systematically incorporate state of the art computer vision to retrieve visually relevant candidate phrases, then produce images descriptions that are substantially more complex and human-like than previous attempts.",

        "9On a related note, the notion of saliency also differs in that human written captions often digress on details that might be tangential to the visible content of the image.",
