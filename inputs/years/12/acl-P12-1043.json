        "In the past few years, opinion mining and sentiment analysis have attracted much attention in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR) (Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu, 2010).",
        "Sentiment lexicon construction and topic lexicon extraction are two fundamental subtasks for opinion mining (Qiu et al., 2009).",
        "A sentiment lexicon is a list of sentiment expressions, which are used to indicate sentiment polarity (e.g., positive or negative).",
        "The sentiment lexicon is domain dependent as users may use different sentiment words to express their opinion in different domains (e.g., different products).",
        "A topic lexicon is a list of topic expressions, on which the sentiment words are expressed.",
        "Extracting the topic lexicon from a specific domain is important because users not only care about the overall sentiment polarity of a review but also care about which aspects are mentioned in review.",
        "Note that, similar to sentiment lexicons, different domains may have very different topic lexicons.",
        "Recently, Jin and Ho (2009) and Li et al. (2010a) showed that supervised learning methods can achieve state-of-the-art results for lexicon extraction.",
        "However, the performance of these methods highly relies on manually annotated training data.",
        "In most cases, the labeling work may be time-consuming and expensive.",
        "It is impossible to annotate each domain of interest to build precise domain-dependent lexicons.",
        "It is more desirable to automatically construct precise lexicons in domains of interest by transferring knowledge from other domains.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the co-extraction task of sentiment and topic lexicons in a target domain where we do not have any labeled data, but have plenty of labeled data in a source domain.",
        "Our goal is to leverage the knowledge extracted from the source domain to help lexicon co-extraction in the target domain.",
        "To address this problem, we propose a two-stage domain adaptation method.",
        "In the first step, we build a bridge between the source and target domains by identifying some common sentiment words as sentiment seeds in the target domain, such as ?good?, ?bad?, ?nice?, etc.",
        "After that, we generate topic seeds in the target domain by mining some general syntactic relation patterns between the sentiment and topic words from the source domain.",
        "In the second step, we propose a Relational Adaptive bootstraPping (RAP) algorithm to expand the seeds in the target domain.",
        "Our proposed method can uti",
        "lize useful labeled data from the source domain as well as exploit the relationships between the topic and sentiment words to propagate information for lexicon construction in the target domain.",
        "Experimental results show that our proposed method is effective for cross-domain lexicon co-extraction.",
        "In summary, we have three main contributions: 1) We give a systematic study on cross-domain sentiment analysis in word level.",
        "While, most of previous work focused on document level; 2) A new two-step domain adaptation framework, with a novel RAP algorithm for seed expansion, is proposed.",
