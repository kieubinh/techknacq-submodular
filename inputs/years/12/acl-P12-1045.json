        "Learning to understand the semantics of human languages has been one of the ultimate goals of natural language processing (NLP).",
        "Traditional learning approaches have relied on access to parallel corpora of natural language sentences paired with their meanings (Mooney, 2007; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007; Lu et al., 2008; Kwiatkowski et al., 2010).",
        "However, constructing such semantic annotations can be difficult and time-consuming.",
        "More recently, there has been work on learning from ambiguous supervision where a set of potential sentence meanings are given, only one (or a small subset) of which are correct (Chen and Mooney, 2008; Liang et al., 2009; Bordes et al., 2010; Chen andMooney, 2011).",
        "Given the training data, the system needs to infer the correcting meaning for each training sentence.",
        "Building a lexicon of the formal meaning representations of words and phrases, either implicitly or explicitly, is usually an important step in inferring the meanings of entire sentences.",
        "In particular, Chen and Mooney (2011) first learned a lexicon to help them resolve ambiguous supervision of relational data in which the number of choices is exponential.",
        "They represent the perceptual context as a graph and allow each sentence in the training data to align to any connected subgraph.",
        "Their lexicon learning algorithm finds the common connected subgraph that occurs with a word by taking intersections of the graphs that represent the different contexts in which the word appears.",
        "While the algorithm produced a good lexicon for their application of learning to interpret navigation instructions, it only works in batch settings and does not scale well to large datasets.",
        "In this paper we introduce a novel online algorithm that is an order of magnitude faster and also produces better results on their navigation task.",
        "In addition to the new lexicon learning algorithm, we also look at modifying the meaning representation grammar (MRG) for their formal semantic language.",
        "By using a MRG that correlates better to the structure of natural language, we further improve the performance on the navigation task.",
        "Since our al",
        "gorithm can scale to larger datasets, we present results on collecting and training on additional data from Amazon's Mechanical Turk.",

        "A common way to learn a lexicon across many different contexts is to find the common parts of the formal representations associated with different occurrences of the same words or phrases (Siskind, 1996).",

        "The goal of the navigation task is to build a system that can understand free-form natural-language instructions and follow them to move to the intended destination (MacMahon et al., 2006; Shimizu and Haas, 2009; Matuszek et al., 2010; Kollar et al., 2010; Vogel and Jurafsky, 2010; Chen and Mooney, 2011).",

        "The goal is then to build a system that can produce the correct aj given a previously unseen (ej , wj) pair.",
        "Since the observed actions ai only consists of low-level actions (e.g. turn left, turn right, walk forward) and not high-level concepts (e.g. turn your back against the wall and walk to the couch), Chen and Mooney first use a set of rules to automatically construct the space of reasonable plans using the action trace and knowledge about the world.",
        "The space is represented compactly using a graph as shown in",
        "and consists of the low-level observed actions interleaved with verification steps indicating what objects should be observed after each action.",
        "Given that these landmarks plans contain a lot of extraneous details, Chen andMooney learn a lexicon and use it to identify and remove the irrelevant parts of the plans.",
        "They use a greedy method to remove nodes from the graphs that are not associated with any of the words in the instructions.",
        "The remaining refined landmarks plans are then treated as supervised training data for a semantic-parser learner, KRISP (Kate and Mooney, 2006).",

We also update the counts of how many examples we have encountered so far and counts of the n-grams w and subgraphs g. At any given time, we can compute a lexicon using these various counts.",

        "We use the same scoring function as Chen and Mooney, which can be computed efficiently using the counts we keep.",
        "In contrast to Chen and Mooney's algorithm though, we add the constraint of minimum support by not creating lexical entries for any n-gram w that appeared in less than minSup training examples.",

        "It should be noted that SGOLL can also become computationally intractable if the sizes of the navigations plans are large or if we set the maximum subgraph size m to a large number.",
        "Moreover, the memory requirement can be quite high if there are many different subgraphs g associated with each n-gram w. To deal with such scalability issues, we could use beam-search and only keep the top k candidates associated with each w. Another important step is to define canonical orderings of the nodes in the graphs.",
        "This allows us to determine if two graphs are identical in constant time and also lets us use a hash table to quickly update the co-occurrence and subgraph counts.",

        "The earliest work on cross-situational word learning was by Siskind (1996) who developed a rule-based system to solve the referential ambiguity problem.",
        "However, it did not handle noise and was tested only on artificial data.",
        "More recently, Fazly et al. (2010) proposed a probabilistic incremental model that can learn online similar to our algorithm and was tested on transcriptions of child-directed speech.",
        "However, they generated the semantic representations from the text itself rather than from the environment.",
        "Moreover, the referential ambiguity was introduced artificially by including the correct semantic representation of the neighboring sentence.",
        "Our work falls into the larger framework of learning the semantics of language from weak supervision.",
        "This problem can be seen as an alignment problem where each sentence in the training data needs to be aligned to one or more records that represent its meaning.",
        "Chen and Mooney (2008) previously introduced another task that aligns sportscasting commentaries to events in a simulated soccer game.",
        "Using an EM-like retraining method, they alternated between building a semantic parser and estimating the most likely alignment.",
        "Liang et al. (2009) developed an unsupervised approach using a generative model to solve the alignment problem.",
        "They demonstrated improved results on matching sentences and events on the sportscasting task and also introduced a new task of aligning weather forecasts to weather information.",
        "Kim and Mooney (2010) further improved the generative alignment model by incorporating the full semantic parsing model from Lu et al. (2008).",
        "This resulted in a joint generative model that outperformed all previous results.",
        "In addition to treating the ambiguous supervision problem as an alignment problem, there have been other approaches such as treating it as a ranking problem (Bordes et al., 2010), or a PCFG learning problem (Borschinger et al., 2011).",
        "Parallel to the work of learning from ambiguous supervision, other recent work has also looked at training semantic parsers from supervision other than logical-form annotations.",
        "Clarke et al. (2010) and Liang et al. (2011) trained systems on question and answer pairs by automatically finding semantic interpretations of the questions that would generate the correct answers.",
        "Artzi and Zettlemoyer (2011) use conversation logs between a computer system and a human user to learn to interpret the human utterances.",
        "Finally, Goldwasser et al. (2011) presented an unsupervised approach of learning a semantic parser by using an EM-like retraining loop.",
        "They use confidence estimation as a proxy for the model's prediction quality, preferring models that have high confidence about their parses."

      "text": [
        "Learning the semantics of language from the perceptual context in which it is uttered is a useful approach because only minimal human supervision is required.",
        "In this paper we presented a novel online algorithm for building a lexicon from ambiguously supervised relational data.",
        "In contrast to the previous approach that computed common subgraphs between different contexts in which an n-gram appeared, we instead focus on small, connected subgraphs and introduce an algorithm, SGOLL, that is an order of magnitude faster.",
        "In addition to being more scalable, SGOLL also performed better on the task of interpreting navigation instructions.",
        "In addition, we showed that changing the MRG and collecting additional training data from Mechanical Turk further improve the performance of the overall navigation system.",
        "Finally, we demonstrated the generality of the system by using it to learn Chinese navigation instructions and achieved similar results."
