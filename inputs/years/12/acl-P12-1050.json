        "Despite the large research effort devoted to the mod-eling of word reordering, this remains one of the main obstacles to the development of accurate SMT systems for many language pairs.",
        "On one hand, the phrase-based approach (PSMT) (Och, 2002; Zens et al., 2002; Koehn et al., 2003), with its shallow and loose modeling of linguistic equivalences, appears as the most competitive choice for closely related language pairs with similar clause structures, both in terms of quality and of efficiency.",
        "On the other, tree-based approaches (Wu, 1997; Yamada, 2002; Chiang, 2005) gain advantage, at the cost of higher complexity and isomorphism assumptions, on language pairs with radically different word orders.",
        "Lying between these two extremes are language pairs where most of the reordering happens locally, and where long reorderings can be isolated and described by a handful of linguistic rules.",
        "Notable examples are the family-unrelated Arabic-English and the related German-English language pairs.",
        "Interestingly, on these pairs, PSMT generally prevails over tree-based SMT1, producing overall high-quality outputs and isolated but critical reordering errors that undermine the global sentence meaning.",
        "Previous works on this type of language pairs have mostly focused on source reordering prior to translation (Xia and McCord, 2004; Collins et al., 2005), or on sophisticated reordering models integrated into decoding (Koehn et al., 2005; Al-Onaizan and Pap-ineni, 2006), achieving mixed results.",
        "To merge the best of both approaches ?",
        "namely, access to rich context in the former and natural coupling of reordering and translation decisions in the latter ?",
        "we intro-ducemodified distortion matrices: a novel method to seamlessly provide to the decoder a set of likely long reorderings precomputed for a given input sentence.",
        "Added to the usual space of local permutations defined by a low distortion limit (DL), this results in a linguistically informed definition of the search space that simplifies the task of the in-decoder reordering model, besides decreasing its complexity.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "After reviewing a selection of relevant works, we analyze salient reordering patterns in Arabic-English and German-English, and describe the corresponding chunk-based reordering rule sets.",
        "In the following sections we present a reordering selection technique based on 1A good comparison of phrase-based and tree-based approaches across language pairs with different reordering levels can be found in (Zollmann et al., 2008).",

        "Pre-processing approaches to word reordering aim at permuting input words in a way that minimizes the reordering needed for translation: deterministic reordering aims at finding a single optimal reordering for each input sentence, which is then translated monotonically (Xia and McCord, 2004) or with a low DL (Collins et al., 2005; Habash, 2007); non-deterministic reordering encodes multiple alternative reorderings into a word lattice and lets a monotonic decoder find the best path according to its models (Zhang et al., 2007; Crego and Habash, 2008; Elming and Habash, 2009; Niehues and Kolss, 2009).",
        "The latter approaches are ideally conceived as alternative to in-decoding reordering, and therefore require an exhaustive reordering rule set.",
        "Two recent works (Bisazza and Federico, 2010; Andreas et al., 2011) opt instead for a hybrid way: rules are used to generate multiple likely reorderings, but only for a specific phenomenon ?",
        "namely verb-initial clauses in Arabic.",
        "This yields sparse reordering lattices that can be translated with a regular decoder performing additional reordering.",
        "Reordering rules for preprocessing are either manually written (Collins et al., 2005) or automatically learned from syntactic parses (Xia and McCord, 2004; Habash, 2007; Elming and Habash, 2009), shallow syntax chunks (Zhang et al., 2007; Crego and Habash, 2008) or part-of-speech labels (Niehues and Kolss, 2009).",
        "Similarly to hybrid approaches, in this work we use few linguistically informed rules to generate multiple reorderings for selected phenomena but, as a difference, we do not employ lattices to represent them.",
        "We also include a competitive in-decoding reordering model in all the systems used to evaluate our methods.",
        "Another large body of work is devoted to the modeling of reordering decisions inside decoding, based on a decomposition of the problem into a sequence of basic reordering steps.",
        "Existing approaches range from basic linear distortion to more complex models that are conditioned on the words being translated.",
        "The linear distortion model (Koehn et al., 2003) encourages monotonic translations by penalizing source position jumps proportionally to their length.",
        "If used alone, this model is inadequate for language pairs with different word orders.",
        "Green et al. (2010) tried to improve it with a future distortion cost estimate.",
        "Thus they were able to preserve baseline performance at a very high DL, but not to improve it.",
        "Lexicalized phrase orientation models (Tillmann, 2004; Koehn et al., 2005; Zens and Ney, 2006; Galley and Manning, 2008) predict the orientation of a phrase with respect to the last translated one.",
        "These models are known to well handle local reordering and are widely adopted by the PSMT community.",
        "However, they are unsuitable to model long reordering as they classify as ?discontinuous?",
        "every phrase that does not immediately follow or precede the last translated one.",
        "Lexicalized distortion models predict the jump from the last translated word to the next one, with a class for each possible jump length (Al-Onaizan and Papineni, 2006), or bin of lengths (Green et al., 2010).",
        "These models are conceived to deal with long reordering, but can easily suffer from data sparseness, especially for longer jumps occurring less frequently.",
        "Following a typical sequence modeling approach, Feng et al. (2010) train n-gram language models on source data previously reordered in accordance to the target language translation.",
        "This method does not directly model reordering decisions, but rather word sequences produced by them.",
        "Despite their high perplexities, reordered LMs yield some improvements when integrated to a PSMT baseline that already includes a discriminative phrase orientation model (Zens and Ney, 2006).",
        "In this work we use similar models to rank sets of chunk permutations.",
        "Attempting to improve the reordering space definition, Yahyaei and Monz (2010) train a classifier to guess the most likely jump length at each source position, then use its predictions to dynamically set the DL.",
        "Translation improvements are obtained on a simple task with mostly short sentences (BTEC).",
        "Modifying the distortion function, as proposed in this paper, makes it possible to expand the pemutation search space by a much finer degree than varying the DL does."

        "Our study focuses on Arabic-English and German-English: two language pairs characterized by uneven distributions of word-reordering phenomena, with long-range movements concentrating on few patterns.",
        "In Arabic-English, the internal order of most noun phrases needs to be reversed during translation, which is generally well handled by phrase-internal reordering or local distortion.",
        "At the constituent level, instead, Arabic admits both SV(O) and VS(O) orders, the latter causing problematic long reorderings.",
        "Common errors due to this issue are the absence of main verb in the English translation, or the placement of the main verb before its own subject.",
        "In both cases, adequacy is seriously compromised.",
        "In German-English, the noun phrase structure is similar between source and target languages.",
        "However, at the constituent level, the verb-second order of German main clauses conflicts with the rigid SVO structure of English, as does the clause-final verb position of German subordinate clauses.",
        "As a further complication, German compound verbs are split apart so that the non-finite element (main verb) can appear long after the inflected auxiliary or modal.",
        "Thanks to sophisticated reordering models, state-of-the-art PSMT systems are generally good at handling local reordering phenomena that are not captured by phrase-internal reordering.",
        "However, they typically fail to predict long reorderings.",
        "We believe this is mainly not the fault of the reordering models, but rather of a too coarse definition of the search space.",
        "To have a concrete idea, consider that a small change of the DL from 5 to 6 words, in a sentence of 8, makes the number of explorable permutations increase from about 9,000 to 22,000.",
        "Existing models cannot be powerful enough to deal with such a rapidly growing search space.",
        "As a result, decoding at very high DLs is not a good solution for these language pairs.",
        "Indeed, decent performances are obtained within a low or mediumDL, but this obviously comes at the expense of long reorderings, which are often crucial to preserve the general meaning of a translated sentence.",
        "For instance, taking English as the target language, it is precisely the relative positioning of predicate arguments that determines their role, in the absence of case markers.",
        "Thus, a wrongly reordered verb with minor impact on automatic scores, can be judged very badly by a human evaluator.",

        "Except for some gains in KRS reported on eval08-NW, most of the scores are lower or equal to the baseline.",

        "However, with modified distortion, the best results according to all metrics are obtained with a DL of 4.",
        "Looking at the rest of the table, we see that reordering selection is not as crucial as in Arabic-English.",
        "This is in line with the properties of the more precise German reordering rule set (two rules out of three generate at most 3 reorderings per sequence).",
        "Considering all scores, the last setting (3-best reordering and A?A) appears as the best one, achieving the following gains over the baseline: +.4/+.5 BLEU, +.2/+.1 METEOR, +1.6/+1.7 KRS and +1.7/+1.8 KRS(R).",
        "The agreement observed among such diverse metrics makes us confident about the goodness of the approach."

        "In Arabic-English and German-English, long reordering concentrates on specific patterns describable by a small number of linguistic rules.",
        "By means of non-deterministic chunk reordering rules, we have generated likely permutations of the test sentences and ranked them with n-gram LMs trained on pre-reordered data.",
        "We have then introduced the notion of modified distortion matrices to naturally encode a set of likely reorderings in the decoder input.",
        "Modified distortion allows for a finer and more linguistically informed definition of the search space, which is reflected in better translation outputs and more efficient decoding.",
        "We expect that further improvements may be achieved by refining the Arabic reordering rules with specific POS tags and lexical cues.",
        "We also plan to evaluate modified distortion matrices in conjunction with a different type of in-decoding reordering model such as the one proposed by Green et al.",
        "(2010).",
        "Finally, we may try to exploit not only the ranking, but also the scores produced by the reordered LMs, as an additional decoding feature."
