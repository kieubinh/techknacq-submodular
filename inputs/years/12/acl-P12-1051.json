        "Since strict isomorphism is overly restrictive, this assumption is often relaxed by applying transformations.",
        "Several approaches assume a tree structure to the NL, MR, or both (Ge and Mooney, 2005; Kate and Mooney, 2006; Wong and Mooney, 2006; Lu et al., 2008; Bo?rschinger et al., 2011), and often in",

        "Yet, while many semantic parsing systems resemble the formalism, each was proposed as an independent model requiring custom algorithms, leaving it unclear how developments in one line of inquiry relate to others.",
        "We argue for a unifying theory of tree transformation based semantic parsing by presenting a tree transducer model and drawing connections to other similar systems.",
        "We make a further contribution by bringing to tree transducers the benefits of the Bayesian framework for principled handling of data sparsity and",

        "Our variational algorithm produces better semantic parses than EM while remaining general to a broad class of transducers appropriate for other domains.",
        "In short, our contributions are three-fold: we present a new state-of-the-art semantic parsing model, propose a broader theory for tree transformation based semantic parsing, and present a general inference algorithm for the tree transducer framework.",

        "Drawing this connection facilitates a greater flow of ideas in the research community, allowing semantic parsing to leverage ideas from other work with tree automata, while making clearer how seemingly isolated efforts might relate to one another.",
        "We demonstrate this by both building on previous work in training tree transducers using EM (Graehl et al., 2008), 7Numbers differ slightly here from previously published results due to the fact that we have standardized the inputs to the different systems.",
        "bold, while the highest among the tree based models are marked with a bullet.",
        "The dotted line separates the tree based from non-tree based models.7 and describing a general purpose variational inference algorithm for adapting tree transducers to the Bayesian framework.",
        "The new VB algorithm results in an overall performance improvement for the transducer over EM training, and the general effectiveness of the approach is further demonstrated by the Bayesian transducer achieving highest accuracy among other tree transformation based approaches."
