        "Online micro-blogging services have revolutionized the way people discover, share, and distribute information.",
        "Twitter is perhaps the most popular such service with over 140 million active users as of 2012.1 Twitter enables users to send and read text-based posts of up to 140 characters, known as tweets.",
        "Twitter users follow others or are followed.",
        "Being a follower on Twitter means that the user receives all the tweets from those she follows.",
        "Common practice of responding to a tweet has evolved into a well-defined markup culture (e.g., RT stands for retweet, ?@?",
        "followed by an identifier indicates the user).",
        "The strict limit of 140 characters allows for quick and immediate communication in real time, whilst enforcing brevity.",
        "Moreover, the retweet mechanism empowers users to spread information of their choice beyond the reach of their original followers.",
        "Twitter has become a prominent broadcasting medium, taking priority over traditional news sources (Teevan et al., 2011).",
        "Shared information through this channel spreads faster than would have been possible with conventional news sites or RSS feeds and can reach a far wider population base.",
        "However, the proliferation of user-generated content comes at a price.",
        "Over 340 millions of tweets are being generated daily amounting to thousands of tweets per second!2 Twitter's own search engine handles more than 1.6 billion search queries per day.3 This enormous amount of data renders it infeasible to browse the entire Twitter network; even if this was possible, it would be extremely difficult for users to find information they are interested in.",
        "A hypothetical tweet recommendation system could",
        "alleviate this acute information overload, e.g., by limiting the stream of tweets to those of interest to the user, or by discovering intriguing content outside the user's following network.",
        "The tweet recommendation task is challenging for several reasons.",
        "Firstly, Twitter does not merely consist of a set of tweets.",
        "Rather, it contains many latent networks including the following relationships among users and the retweeting linkage (which indicates information diffusion).",
        "Secondly, the recommendations ought to be of interest to the user and likely to to attract user response (e.g., to be retweeted).",
        "Thirdly, recommendations should be personalized (Cho and Schonfeld, 2007; Yan et al., 2011), avoid redundancy, and demonstrate diversity.",
        "In this paper we present a graph-theoretic approach to tweet recommendation that attempts to address these challenges.",
        "Our recommender operates over a heterogeneous network that connects the users (or authors) and the tweets they produce.",
        "The user network represents links among authors based on their following be-havior, whereas the tweet network connects tweets based on content similarity.",
        "A third bipartite graph ties the two together.",
        "Tweet and author entities in this network are ranked simultaneously following a co-ranking algorithm (Zhou et al., 2007).",
        "The main intuition behind co-ranking is that there is a mutually reinforcing relationship between authors and tweets that could be reflected in the rankings.",
        "Tweets are important if they are related to other important tweets and authored by important users who in turn are related to other important users.",
        "The model exploits this mutually reinforcing relationship between tweets and their authors and couples two random walks, one on the tweet graph and one on the author graph, into a combined one.",
        "Rather than creating a global ranking over all tweets in a collection, we extend this framework to individual users and produce personalized recommendations.",
        "Moreover, we incorporate diversity by allowing the random walk on the tweet graph to be time-variant (Mei et al., 2010).",
        "Experimental results on a real-world dataset consisting of 364,287,744 tweets from 9,449,542 users show that the co-ranking approach substantially improves performance over the state of the art.",
        "We obtain a relative improvement of 18.3% (in nDCG) and 7.8% (in MAP) over the best comparison system."

        "Many websites currently offer a real-time search service which returns ranked lists of Twitter posts or shared links according to user queries.",

        "Our work also develops a tweet recommendation system.",
        "Our model exploits the information provided by the tweets and the underlying social networks in a unified co-ranking framework.",
        "Although",
        "these sources have been previously used to search or recommend tweets, our model considers them simultaneously and produces a ranking that is informed by both.",
        "Furthermore, we argue that the graph-theoretic framework upon which co-ranking operates is beneficial as it allows to incorporate personalization (we provide user-specific rankings) and diversity (the ranking is optimized so as to avoid redundancy).",
        "The co-ranking framework has been initially developed for measuring scientific impact and modeling the relationship between authors and their publications (Zhou et al., 2007).",
        "However, the adaptation of this framework to the tweet recommendation task is novel to our knowledge."

        "rui is the relevance score (i.e., 1: retweeted, 0: not retweeted) for the i-th tweet in the ranking list for user u.",
        "We also evaluated system output in terms of Mean Average Precision (MAP), under the assumption that retweeted tweets are relevant and the rest irrele",
        "where Nu is the number of reposted tweets for user u, and Pui is the precision at i-th position for user u (Manning et al., 2008).",
        "The automatic evaluation sketched above does not assess the full potential of our recommendation system.",
        "For instance, it is possible for the algorithm to recommend tweets to users with no linkage to their publishers.",
        "Such tweets may be of potential interest, however our goldstandard data can only provide information for tweets and users with following links.",
        "our system and comparison baselines against judgments elicited by users.",
        "We therefore asked the 23 users whose Twitter data formed the basis of our corpus to judge the tweets ranked by our algorithm and comparison systems.",
        "The users were asked to read the systems?",
        "recommendations and decide for every tweet presented to them whether they would retweet it or not, under the assumption that retweeting takes place when users find the tweet interesting.",
        "In both automatic and human-based evaluations we ranked all tweets in the test data.",
        "Then for each date and user we selected the top 50 ones.",
        "Our nDCG and MAP results are averages over users and dates."

        "Our results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.",
        "Table 1 reports results when model performance is evaluated against the gold standard ranking obtained from the Twitter network.",
        "In Table 2 model performance is compared against rankings elicited by users.",
        "As can be seen, the Random method performs worst.",
        "This is hardly surprising as it recommends tweets without any notion of their importance or user interest.",
        "Length performs considerably better than",
        "against human judgments.",
        "Random.",
        "This might be due to the fact that informativeness is related to tweet length.",
        "Using merely the number of retweets does not seem to capture the tweet importance as well as Length.",
        "This suggests that highly retweeted posts are not necessarily informative.",
        "For example, in our data, the most frequently reposted tweet is a commercial advertisement calling for reposting!",
        "The supervised systems (RSVM, DTC, and WLC) greatly improve performance over the naive baselines.",
        "These methods employ standard machine learning algorithms (such as SVMs, decision trees and linear regression) on a large feature space.",
        "Aside from the learning algorithm, their main difference lies in the selection of the feature space, e.g., the way content is represented and whether authority is taken into account.",
        "DTC performs best on most evaluation criteria.",
        "However, neither DTC nor RSVM, or WLC take personalization into account.",
        "They generate the same recommendation lists for all users.",
        "Our co-ranking algorithm models user interest with respect to the content of the tweets and their publishers.",
        "Moreover, it attempts to create diverse output and has an explicit mechanism for minimizing redundancy.",
        "In all instances, using both DCG and MAP, it outperforms the comparison systems.",
        "Interestingly, the performance of CoRank is better when measured against human judgments.",
        "This indicates that users are interested in tweets that fall outside the scope of their followers and that recommendation can improve user experience.",
        "We further examined the contribution of the individual components of our system to the tweet recommendation task.",
        "Tables 3 and 4 show how the performance of our co-ranking algorithm varies when considering only tweet popularity using the standard PageRank algorithm, personalization (PersRank), and diversity (DivRank).",
        "Note that DivRank is only applied to the tweet graph.",
        "The PageRank algorithm on its own makes good recommendations, while incorporating personalization improves the performance substantially, which indicates that individual users show preferences to specific topics or other users.",
        "Diversity on its own does not seem to make a difference, however it improves performance when combined with personalization.",
        "Intuitively, users are more likely to repost tweets from their followees, or tweets closely related to those retweeted previously."

      "heading": "6 Conclusions",
      "text": [
        "We presented a co-ranking framework for a tweet recommendation system that takes popularity, personalization and diversity into account.",
        "Central to our approach is the representation of tweets and their users in a heterogeneous network and the ability to produce a global ranking that takes both information sources into account.",
        "Our model obtains substantial performance gains over competitive approaches on a large real-world dataset (it improves by 18.3% in DCG and 7.8% in MAP over the best baseline).",
        "Our experiments suggest that improvements are due to the synergy of the two information sources (i.e., tweets and their authors).",
        "The adopted graph-theoretic framework is advantageous in that it allows to produce user-specific recommendations and incorporate diversity in a unified model.",
        "Evaluation with actual Twitter users shows that our recommender can indeed identify interesting information that lies outside the the user's immediate following network.",
        "In the future, we plan to extend the co-ranking framework so as to incorporate information credibility and temporal recency.",
