        "We adapt the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR) which have been reported to be effective for classification and the Linear CRF (LCRF) which is used to summarize ordinary text documents in (Shen et al., 2007) as baselines for comparison.",
        "To better illustrate the effectiveness of question segmentation based contextual factors and the group L1 regularization term, we carry the tests in the following sequence: (a) we use only the contextual factors cf3 and cf4 with default L2 regularization (gCRF); (b) we add the reply question based factors cf1 and cf2 to the model (gCRF-QS); and (c) we replace default L2 regularization with our proposed group L1 regularization term (gCRF-QS-l1).",
        "For linear CRF system, we use all our textual and non-textual features as well as the local (exact previous and next) neighborhood contextual factors instead of the features of (Shen et al., 2007) for fairness.",
        "For the thresholds used in the contextual factors, we enforce ?lq to be equal to ?ls and ?uq equal to ?us for the purpose of simplifying the parameters setting (?lq = ?ls = 0.4, ?uq = ?us = 0.8 in our experiments).",
        "We randomly divide the dataset into ten subsets (every subset with 40 questions and the associated answers), and conduct a tenfold cross validation and for each round where the nine subsets are used to train the model and the remaining one for testing.",
        "The precision, recall and F1 measures of these models are presented in Table 2.",
        "Table 2 shows that our general CRF model based on question segmentation with group L1 regularization outperforms the baselines significantly in all three measures (gCRF-QS-l1 is 13.99% better than SVM in precision, 9.77% better in recall and 11.72% better in F1 score).",
        "We note that both SVM and LR,",

        "denotes there is no difference in statistical significance.",
        "which just utilize the independent sentence-level features, behave not vary well here, and there is no statistically significant performance difference between them.",
        "We also find that LCRF which utilizes the local context information between sentences perform better than the LR method in precision and F1 with statistical significance.",
        "While we consider the general local and non-local contextual factor cf3 and cf4 for novelty and non-redundancy constraints, the gCRF performs much better than LCRF in all three measures; and we obtain further performance improvement by adding the contextual factors based on QS, especially in the recall measurement.",
        "This is mainly because we have divided the question into several sub questions, and the system is able to select more novel sentences than just treating the original multi-sentence as a whole.",
        "In addition, when we replace the default L2 regularization by the group L1 regularization for more efficient feature weight learning, we obtain a much better performance in precision while not sacrificing the recall measurement statistically.",
        "We also compute the Precision, Recall and F1 in ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L measurements, which are widely used to measure the quality of automatic text summarization.",
        "The experimental results are listed in Table 3.",
        "All results in the Table are the average of the tenfold cross validation experiments on our dataset.",
        "It is observed that our gCRF-QS-l1 model improves the performance in terms of precision, recall and F1 score on all three measurements of ROUGE1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L by a significant margin compared to other baselines due to the use of local and non-local contextual factors and factors based on QS with group L1 regularization.",
        "Since the ROUGEmeasures care more about the recall and precision of N-grams as well as common substrings to the reference summary rather than the whole sentence, they offer a better measurement in modeling the user's information needs.",
        "Therefore, the improvements in these measures are more encouraging than those of the average classification accuracy for answer summarization.",
        "From the viewpoint of ROUGE measures we observe that our question segmentation method can enhance the recall of the summaries significantly due to the more fine-grained modeling of sub questions.",
        "We also find that the precision of the group L1 regularization is much better than that of the default L2 regularization while not hurting the recall significantly.",

        "The main reasons that the feature 7 (Similarity to Question) has low contribution is that we have utilized the similarity to question in the contextual factors, and this similarity feature in the single site becomes redundant.",
        "Similarly, the features Author Level and Best Answer Number are likely to be redundant when other non-textual features(Total Answer Number and Total Points) are presented together.",
