        "While some sellers (generally large professional ones) provide rich, structured description of their products (using schemas or via a global trade item number), the vast majority only provide unstructured natural language descriptions.",
        "To manage items effectively and provide the best user experience, it is critical for these marketplaces to structure their inventory into descriptive name-value pairs (called properties) and ensure that items of the same kind (digital cameras for instance) are described using a unique set of property names (brand, model, zoom, resolution, etc.)",

        "For example, this is important for measuring item similarity and complementarity in merchandising, providing faceted navigation and various business intelligence applications.",
        "Note that structuring items does not necessarily mean identifying products as not all e-commerce inventory is manufactured (animals for examples).",
        "Structuring inventory in the e-commerce domain raises several challenges.",
        "First, one needs to identify and extract the names and the values used by individual sellers from unstructured textual descriptions.",
        "Second, different sellers may describe the same product in very different ways, using different terminologies.",
        "For example, Figure 1 shows 3 item descriptions of hard drives from 3 different sellers.",
        "The left description mentions ?rotational speed?",
        "in a specification table while the other two descriptions use the synonym ?spindle speed?",
        "in a bulleted list (top right) or natural language specifications (bottom right).",
        "This requires discovering semantically equivalent property names and values across inventories from multiple sellers.",
        "Third, the scale at which on-line marketplaces operate makes impractical to solve any of these problems manually.",
        "For instance, eBay reported 99 million active users in 2011, many of whom are sellers, which may translate into thousands or even millions of synonyms to discover accross more than 20,000 categories ranging from consumer electronics to collectible and art.",
        "This paper describes a two step process for structuring items in the e-commerce domain.",
        "The first step consists in an unsupervised property extraction technique which allows discovering name-value",

        "A lot of progress has been accomplished in the area of property discovery from product reviews since the pioneering work by (Hu and Liu, 2004).",
        "Most of this work is based on the observation, later formalized as double propagation by (Qiu et al., 2009), that in reviews, opinion words are usually associated with product properties in some ways, and thus product properties can be identified from opinion words and opinion words from properties alternately and iteratively.",
        "While (Hu and Liu, 2004) initially used association mining techniques; (Liu et al., 2005) used Part-Of-Speech and supervised rule mining to generate language patterns and identify product properties; (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005) used point wise mutual information between candidate properties and meronymy discriminators; (Zhuang et al., 2006; Qiu et al., 2009) improved on previous work by using dependency parsing; (Kobayashi et al., 2007) mined property-opinion patterns using statistical and contextual cues; (Wang and Wang, 2008) leveraged property-opinion mutual information and linguistic rules to identify infrequent properties; and (Zhang et al., 2010) proposed a ranking scheme to improve double propagation precision.",
        "In this paper, we are focusing on extracting properties from product descriptions which do not contain opinion words.",
        "In a sense, item properties can be viewed as slots of product templates and our work bears similarities with template induction methods.",
        "(Chambers and Jurafsky, 2011) proposed a method for inferring event templates based on word clustering according to their proximity in the corpus and syntactic function clustering.",
        "Unfortunately, this technique cannot be applied to our problem due to the lack of discourse redundancy within item descriptions.",
        "(Putthividhya and Hu, 2011) and (Sachan et al., 2011) also addressed the problem of structuring items in the e-commerce domain.",
        "However, these works assume that property names are known in advance and focus on discovering values for these properties from very short product titles.",
        "Although we are primarily concerned with unsupervised property discovery, it is worth mentioning (Peng and McCallum, 2004) and (Ghani et al., 2006) who approached the problem using supervised machine learning techniques and require labeled data."

        "Our work is related to the synonym discovery research which aims at identifying groups of words that are semantically identical based on some defined similarity metric.",
        "The body of work on this problem can be divided into two major approaches (Agirre et al., 2009): methods that are based on the available knowledge resources (e.g., WordNet, or available taxonomies) (Yang and Powers, 2005; Alvarez and Lim, 2007; Hughes and Ra-mage, ), and methods that use contextual/property distribution around the words (Pereira et al., 1993; Chen et al., 2006; Sahami and Heilman, 2006; Pan-tel et al., 2009).",
        "(Zhai et al., 2010) propose a constrained semi-supervised learning method using a naive Bayes formulation of EM seeded by a small set of labeled data and a set of soft constraints based on the prior knowledge of the problem.",
        "There has been also some recent work on applying topic mod-eling (e.g., LDA) for solving this problem (Guo et al., 2009).",
        "Our work is also related to the existing research on schema matching problem where the objective is to identify objects that are semantically related cross schemas.",
        "There has been an extensive study on the",

        "problem of schema matching (for a comprehensive survey see (Rahm and Bernstein, 2001; Bellahsene et al., 2011; Bernstein et al., 2011)).",
        "In general the work can be classified into rule-based and learning-based approaches.",
        "Rule-based systems (Castano and de Antonellis, 1999; Milo and Zohar, 1998; L. Palopol and Ursino, 1998) often utilize only the schema information (e.g., elements, domain types of schema elements, and schema structure) to define a similarity metric for performing matching among the schema elements in a hard coded fashion.",
        "In contrast learning based approaches learn a similarity metric based on both the schema information and the data.",
        "Earlier learning based systems (Li and Clifton, 2000; Perkowitz and Etzioni, 1995; Clifton et al., 1997) often rely on one type of learning (e.g., schema meta-data, statistics of the data content, properties of the objects shared between the schemas, etc).",
        "These systems do not exploit the complete textual information in the data content therefore have limited applicability.",
        "Most recent systems attempt to incorporate the textual contents of the data sources into the system.",
        "Doan et al.",
        "(2001) introduce LSD which is a semi-automatic machine learning based matching framework that trains a set of base learners using a set of user provided semantic mappings over a small data sources.",

        "Given a new data source, the base learners are used to discover semantic mappings and their prediction is combined using a meta-learner.",
        "Similar to LSD, GLUE (Doan et al., 2003) also uses a set of base learners combined into a meta-learner for solving the matching problem between two ontologies.",
        "Our work is mostly related to (Wick et al., 2008) where they propose a general framework for performing jointly schema matching, co-reference and canonicalization using a supervised machine learning approach.",

        "In other words, popular properties are used by many sellers and some of them write their descriptions in a manner that makes these properties easy to extract.",
