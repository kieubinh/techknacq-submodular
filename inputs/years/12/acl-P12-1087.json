        "Relation extraction is the problem of populating a target relation (representing an entity-level relationship or attribute) with facts extracted from natural-language text.",
        "Sample relations include people's titles, birth places, and marriage relationships.",
        "Traditional relation-extraction systems rely on manual annotations or domain-specific rules provided by experts, both of which are scarce resources that are not portable across domains.",
        "To remedy these problems, recent years have seen interest in the distant supervision approach for relation extraction (Wu and Weld, 2007; Mintz et al., 2009).",
        "The input to distant supervision is a set of seed facts for the target relation together with an (unlabeled) text corpus, and the output is a set of (noisy) annotations that can be used by any machine learning technique to train a statistical model for the target relation.",
        "For example, given the target relation birthPlace(person, place) and a seed fact birthPlace(John, Springfield), the sentence ?John and his wife were born in Springfield in 1946?",
        "(S1) would qualify as a positive training example.",
        "Distant supervision replaces the expensive process of manually acquiring annotations that is required by direct supervision with resources that already exist in many scenarios (seed facts and a text corpus).",
        "On the other hand, distantly labeled data may not be as accurate as manual annotations.",
        "For example, ?John left Springfield when he was 16?",
        "(S2) would also be considered a positive example about place of birth by distant supervision as it contains both John and Springfield.",
        "The hypothesis is that the broad coverage and high redundancy in a large corpus would compensate for this noise.",
        "For example, with a large enough corpus, a distant supervision system may find that patterns in the sentence S1 strongly correlate with seed facts of birthPlace whereas patterns in S2 do not qualify as a strong indicator.",
        "Thus, intuitively the quality of distant supervision should improve as we use larger corpora.",
        "However, there has been no study on the impact of corpus size on distant supervision for relation extraction.",
        "Our goal is to fill this gap.",

        "another resource that may be valuable to distant supervision is crowdsourc",

        "For example, one could employ crowd workers to provide feedback on whether distant supervision examples are correct or not (Gormley et al., 2010).",
        "Intuitively the crowd workforce is a perfect fit for such tasks since many erroneous distant labels could be easily identified and corrected by humans.",
        "For example, distant supervision may mistakenly consider ?Obama took a vacation in Hawaii?",
        "a positive example for birthPlace simply because a database says that Obama was born in Hawaii; a crowd worker would correctly point out that this sentence is not actually indicative of this relation.",
        "It is unclear however which strategy one should use: scaling the text corpus or the amount of human feedback.",
        "Our primary contribution is to empirically assess how scaling these inputs to distant supervision impacts its result quality.",
        "We study this question with input data sets that are orders of magnitude larger than those in prior work.",
        "While the largest corpus (Wikipedia and New York Times) employed by recent work on distant supervision (Mintz et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011) contain about 2M documents, we run experiments on a 100M-document (50X more) corpus drawn from ClueWeb.1 While prior work (Gormley et al., 2010) on crowdsourcing for distant supervision used thousands of human feedback units, we acquire tens of thousands of human-provided labels.",
        "Despite the large scale, we follow state-of-the-art distant supervision approaches and use deep linguistic features, e.g., part-of-speech tags and dependency parsing.2 Our experiments shed insight on the following",
        "two questions: 1.",
        "How does increasing the corpus size impact the quality of distant supervision?",
        "2.",
        "For a given corpus size, how does increasing",
        "the amount of human feedback impact the quality of distant supervision?",

        "For example, on a TAC corpus with",
        "We find that the quality of distant supervision tends to be recall gated, that is, for any given relation, distant supervision fails to find all possible linguistic signals that indicate a relation.",
        "By expanding the corpus one can expand the number of patterns that occur with a known set of entities.",
        "Thus, as a rule of thumb for developing distant supervision systems, one should first attempt to expand the training corpus and then worry about precision of labels only after having obtained a broad-coverage corpus.",
        "Throughout this paper, it is important to understand the difference between mentions and entities.",

        "We found that text corpus size has a stronger impact on precision and recall than human feedback.",
        "We observed that distant-supervision systems are often recall gated; thus, to improve distant-supervision quality, one should first try to enlarge the input training corpus and then increase precision.",
        "It was initially counter-intuitive to us that human labels did not have a large impact on precision.",
        "One reason is that human labels acquired from crowdsourcing have comparable noise level as distant labels ?",
        "as shown by Figure 4.",
        "Thus, techniques that improve the accuracy of crowd-sourced answers are an interesting direction for future work.",
        "We used a particular form of human input (yes/no votes on distant labels) and a particular statistical model to incorporate this information (logistic regression).",
        "It is interesting future work to study other types of human input (e.g., new examples or features) and more sophisticated techniques for incorporating human input, as well as machine learning methods that explicitly model feature interactions."
