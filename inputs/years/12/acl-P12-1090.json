        "Verb classifications have been shown to be useful both from a theoretical and from a practical perspective.",
        "From the theoretical viewpoint, they permit capturing syntactic and/or semantic generalisations about verbs (Levin, 1993; Kipper Schuler, 2006).",
        "From a practical perspective, they support factorisation and have been shown to be effective in various NLP (Natural language Processing) tasks such as semantic role labelling (Swier and Stevenson, 2005) or word sense disambiguation (Dang, 2004).",
        "While there has been much work on automatically acquiring verb classes for English (Sun et al., 2010) and to a lesser extent for German (Brew and Schulte im Walde, 2002; Schulte im Walde, 2003; Schulte im Walde, 2006), Japanese (Oishi and Matsumoto, 1997) and Italian (Merlo et al., 2002), few studies have been conducted on the automatic classification of French verbs.",
        "Recently however, two proposals have been put forward.",
        "On the one hand, (Sun et al., 2010) applied a clustering approach developed for English to French.",
        "They exploit features extracted from a large scale subcategorisation lexicon (LexSchem (Mes-siant, 2008)) acquired fully automatically from Le Monde newspaper corpus and show that, as for English, syntactic frames and verb selectional preferences perform better than lexical cooccurence features.",
        "Their approach achieves a F-measure of 55.1 on 116 verbs occurring at least 150 times in Lexschem.",
        "The best performance is achieved when restricting the approach to verbs occurring at least 4000 times (43 verbs) with an F-measure of 65.4.",
        "On the other hand, Falk and Gardent (2011) present a classification approach for French verbs based on the use of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA).",
        "FCA (Barbut and Monjardet, 1970) is a symbolic classification technique which permits creating classes associating sets of objects (eg.",
        "French verbs) with sets of features (eg.",
        "syntactic frames).",
        "Falk and Gardent (2011) provide no evaluation for their results however, only a qualitative analysis.",
        "In this paper, we describe a novel approach to the clustering of French verbs which (i) gives good results on the established benchmark used in (Sun et al., 2010) and (ii) associates verbs with a feature profile describing their syntactic and semantic properties.",
        "The approach exploits a clustering method called IGNGF (Incremental Growing Neural Gas with Feature Maximisation, (Lamirel et al., 2011b)) which uses the features characterising each cluster both to guide the clustering process and to label the output clusters.",
        "We apply this method to the data contained in various verb lexicons and we evalu",
        "ate the resulting classification on a slightly modified version of the gold standard provided by (Sun et al., 2010).",
        "We show that the approach yields promising results (F-measure of 70%) and that the clustering produced systematically associates verbs with syntactic frames and thematic grids thereby providing an interesting basis for the creation and evaluation of a Verbnet-like classification.",
        "Section 2 describes the lexical resources used for feature extraction and Section 3 the experimental setup.",
        "Sections 4 and 5 present the data used for and the results obtained.",

        "Our aim is to accquire a classification which covers the core verbs of French, could be used to support semantic role labelling and is similar in spirit to the English Verbnet.",
        "In this first experiment, we therefore favoured extracting the features used for clustering, not from a large corpus parsed automatically, but from manually validated resources1.",
        "These lexical resources are (i) a syntactic lexicon produced by merging three existing lexicons for French and (ii) the English Verbnet.",
        "Among the many syntactic lexicons available for French (Nicolas et al., 2008; Messiant, 2008; Kups?c?",
        "and Abeille?, 2008; van den Eynde and Mertens, 2003; Gross, 1975), we selected and merged three lexicons built or validated manually namely, Dico-valence, TreeLex and the LADL tables.",
        "The resulting lexicon contains 5918 verbs, 20433 lexical entries (i.e., verb/frame pairs) and 345 subcategorisation frames.",
        "It also contains more detailed syntactic and semantic features such as lexical preferences (e.g., locative argument, concrete object) or thematic role information (e.g., symmetric arguments, asset role) which we make use of for clustering.",
        "We use the English Verbnet as a resource for associating French verbs with thematic grids as follows.",
        "We translate the verbs in the English Verbnet classes to French using English-French dictionaries2.",
        "To 1Of course, the same approach could be applied to corpus based data (as done e.g., in (Sun et al., 2010)) thus making the approach fully unsupervised and directly applicable to any language for which a parser is available.",
        "deal with polysemy, we train a supervised classifier as follows.",
        "We first map French verbs with English Verbnet classes: A French verb is associated with an English Verbnet class if, according to our dictionaries, it is a translation of an English verb in this class.",
        "The task of the classifier is then to produce a probability estimate for the correctness of this association, given the training data.",
        "The training set is built by stating for 1740 ?French verb, English Verbnet class?",
        "pairs whether the verb has the thematic grid given by the pair's Verbnet class3.",
        "This set is used to train an SVM (support vector machine) classifier4.",
        "The features we use are similar to those used in (Mouton, 2010): they are numeric and are derived for example from the number of translations an English or French verb had, the size of the Verbnet classes, the number of classes a verb is a member of etc.",
        "The resulting classifier gives for each ?French verb, English VN class?",
        "pair the estimated probability of the pair's verb being a member of the pair's class5.",
        "We select 6000 pairs with highest probability estimates and obtain the translated classes by assigning each verb in a selected pair to the pair's class.",

        "Given this, cluster C2 correctly groups together two Verbnet classes (other cos-45.4 and hit-18.1) which share the same thematic grid (cf. Table 3).",
        "In addition, the features associated with this cluster indicate that verbs in these two classes are transitive, select a concrete object, and can be pronominalised which again is correct for most verbs in that cluster.",
        "Similarly, cluster C11 groups together verbs from two Verbnet classes with identical theta grid (light emission-43.1 and modes of being with motion-47.3) while its associated features correctly indicate that verbs from both classes accept both the intransitive form without object (la jeune fille rayonne / the young girl glows, un cheval galope / a horse gallops) and with a prepositional object (la jeune fille rayonne de bonheur / the young girl glows with happiness, un cheval galope vers l?infini / a horse gallops to infinity).",
        "The third cluster grouping together verbs from two Verbnet classes is C7 which contains mainly judgement verbs (to applaud, bless, compliment, punish) but also some verbs from the (very large) other cos-45.4 class.",
        "In this case, a prevalent shared feature is that both types of verbs accept a de-object that is, a prepositional object introduced by ?de?",
        "(Jean ap-plaudit Marie d?avoir danse?",
        "/ Jean applaudit Marie for having danced; Jean de?gage le sable de la route / Jean clears the sand of the road).",
        "The semantic features necessary to provide a finer grained analysis of their differences are lacking.",
        "Interestingly, clustering also highlights classes which are semantically homogeneous but syntactically distinct.",
        "While clusters C6 and C10 both",
        "contain mostly verbs from the amuse-31.1 class (amuser,agacer,e?nerver,de?primer), their features indicate that verbs in C10 accept the pronominal form (e.g., Jean s?amuse) while verbs in C6 do not (e.g., *Jean se de?prime).",
        "In this case, clustering highlights a syntactic distinction which is present in French but not in English.",
        "In contrast, the dispersion of verbs from the other cos-45.4 class over clusters C2 and C7 has no obvious explanation.",
        "One reason might be that this class is rather large (361 verbs) and thus might contain French verbs that do not necessarily share properties with the original Verbnet class.",
        "Syntax and Semantics.",
        "We examined whether the prevalent syntactic features labelling each cluster were compatible with the verbs and with the semantic class(es) manually assigned to the clusters.",
        "Table 6 sketches the relation between cluster, syntactic frames and Verbnet like classes.",
        "It shows for instance that the prevalent frame of the C0 class (manner speaking-37.3) correctly indicates that verbs in that cluster subcategorise for a sentential argument and an AOBJ (prepositional object in ?a`?)",
        "(e.g., Jean bafouille a` Marie qu?il est amoureux / Jean stammers to Mary that he is in love); and that verbs in the C9 class (characterize-29.2) subcategorise for an object NP and an attribute (Jean nomme Marie pre?sidente / Jean appoints Marie president).",
        "In general, we found that the prevalent frames associated with each cluster adequately characterise the syntax of that verb class."

        "We presented an approach to the automatic classification of french verbs which showed good results on an established testset and associates verb clusters with syntactic and semantic features.",
        "Whether the features associated by the IGNGF clustering with the verb clusters appropriately car-acterise these clusters remains an open question.",
        "We carried out a first evaluation using these features to label the syntactic arguments of verbs in a corpus with thematic roles and found that precision is high but recall low mainly because of polysemy: the frames and grids made available by the classification for a given verb are correct for that verb but not for the verb sense occurring in the corpus.",
        "This suggests that overlapping clustering techniques need to",
        "Verbnet like classes.",
        "be applied.",
        "We are also investigating how the approach scales up to the full set of verbs present in the lexicon.",
        "Both Dicovalence and the LADL tables contain rich detailed information about the syntactic and semantic properties of French verbs.",
        "We intend to tap on that potential and explore how well the various semantic features that can be extracted from these resources support automatic verb classification for the full set of verbs present in our lexicon."
