        "Modeling word reordering between source and target sentences has been a research focus since the emerging of statistical machine translation.",
        "In phrase-based models (Och, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003), phrase is introduced to serve as the fundamental translation element and deal with local reordering, while a distance based distortion model is used to coarsely depict the exponentially decayed word movement probabilities in language translation.",
        "Further work in this direction employed lexi?This work has been done while the first author was visiting Microsoft Research Asia.",
        "calized distortion models, including both generative (Koehn et al., 2005) and discriminative (Zens and Ney, 2006; Xiong et al., 2006) variants, to achieve finer-grained estimations, while other work took into account the hierarchical language structures in translation (Chiang, 2005; Galley and Manning, 2008).",
        "Long-distance word reordering between language pairs with substantial word order difference, such as Japanese with Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) structure and English with Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure, is generally viewed beyond the scope of the phrase-based systems discussed above, because of either distortion limits or lack of discriminative features for modeling.",
        "The most notable solution to this problem is adopting syntax-based SMT models, especially methods making use of source side syntactic parse trees.",
        "There are two major categories in this line of research.",
        "One is tree-to-string model (Quirk et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006) which directly uses source parse trees to derive a large set of translation rules and associated model parameters.",
        "The other is called syntax pre-reordering ?",
        "an approach that repositions source words to approximate target language word order as much as possible based on the features from source syntactic parse trees.",
        "This is usually done in a preprocessing step, and then followed by a standard phrase-based SMT system that takes the reordered source sentence as input to finish the translation.",
        "In this paper, we continue this line of work and address the problem of word reordering based on source syntactic parse trees for SMT.",
        "Similar to most previous work, our approach tries to rearrange the source tree nodes sharing a common parent to mimic",
        "the word order in target language.",
        "To this end, we propose a simple but effective ranking-based approach to word reordering.",
        "The ranking model is automatically derived from the word aligned parallel data, viewing the source tree nodes to be reordered as list items to be ranked.",
        "The ranks of tree nodes are determined by their relative positions in the target language ?",
        "the node in the most front gets the highest rank, while the ending word in the target sentence gets the lowest rank.",
        "The ranking model is trained to directly minimize the mis-ordering of tree nodes, which differs from the prior work based on maximum likelihood estimations of reordering patterns (Li et al., 2007; Genzel, 2010), and does not require any special tweaking in model training.",
        "The ranking model can not only be used in a pre-reordering based SMT system, but also be integrated into a phrase-based decoder serving as additional distortion features.",
        "We evaluated our approach on large-scale Japanese-English and English-Japanese machine translation tasks, and experimental results show that our approach can bring significant improvements to the baseline phrase-based SMT system in both pre-ordering and integrated decoding settings.",
        "In the rest of the paper, we will first formally present our ranking-based word reordering model, then followed by detailed steps of modeling training and integration into a phrase-based SMT system.",

        "dependency labels (for English), function words (for Japanese), and the distance and punctuations between child and head.",

        "Lexicon features generally continue to improve the RankingSVM accuracy and reduce CLN on training data, but they do not bring further improvement for SMT systems beyond the top 100 most frequent words.",
        "Our explanation is that less frequent lexicons tend to help local reordering only, which is already handled by the underlying phrase-based system."

        "There have been several studies focusing on compiling hand-crafted syntactic reorder rules.",
        "Collins et al.",
        "(2005), Wang et al. (2007), Ramanathan et al. (2008), Lee et al. (2010) have developed rules for German-English, Chinese-English, English-Hindi and English-Japanese respectively.",
        "Xu et al. (2009) designed a clever precedence reordering rule set for translation from English to several SOV languages.",
        "The drawback for hand-crafted rules is that they depend upon expert knowledge to produce and are limited to their targeted language pairs.",
        "Automatically learning syntactic reordering rules have also been explored in several work.",
        "Li et al.",
        "(2007) and Visweswariah et al. (2010) learned probability of reordering patterns from constituent trees using either Maximum Entropy or maximum likelihood estimation.",
        "Since reordering patterns are matched against a tree node together with all its direct children, data sparseness problem will arise when tree nodes have many children (Li et al., 2007); Visweswariah et al. (2010) also mentioned their method yielded no improvement when applied to dependency trees in their initial experiments.",
        "Genzel (2010) dealt with the data sparseness problem by using window heuristic, and learned reordering pattern sequence from dependency trees.",
        "Even with the window heuristic, they were unable to evaluate all candidates due to the huge number of possible patterns.",
        "Different from the previous approaches, we treat syntax-based reordering as a ranking problem between different source tree nodes.",
        "Our method does not require the source nodes to match some specific patterns, but encodes reordering knowledge in the form of a ranking function, which naturally handles reordering between any number of tree nodes; the ranking function is trained by well-established rank learning method to minimize the number of mis-ordered tree nodes in the training data.",
        "Tree-to-string systems (Quirk et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006) model syntactic reordering using minimal or composed translation rules, which may contain reordering involving tree nodes from multiple tree levels.",
        "Our method can be naturally extended to deal with such multiple level reordering.",
        "For a tree-to-string rule with multiple tree levels, instead of ranking the direct children of the root node, we rank all leaf nodes (Most are frontier nodes (Galley et al., 2006)) in the translation rule.",
        "We need to redesign our ranking feature templates to encode the reordering information in the source part of the translation rules.",
        "We need to remember the source side context of the rules, the model size would still be much smaller than a full-fledged tree-to-string system because we do not need to explicitly store the target variants for each rule."
