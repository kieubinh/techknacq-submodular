        "The hierarchical phrase-based model (Chiang, 2007) makes an advance of statistical machine translation by employing hierarchical phrases, which not only uses phrases to learn local translations but also uses hierarchical phrases to capture reorderings of words and subphrases which can cover a large scope.",
        "Besides, this model is formal syntax-based and does not need to specify the syntactic constituents of subphrases, so it can directly learn synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG) from a parallel text without relying on any linguistic annotations or assumptions, which makes it used conveniently and widely.",
        "?This work was done when the first author visited Microsoft Research Asia as an intern.",

        "The tree-to-string model (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006) introduces linguistic syntax via source parse to direct word reordering, especially long-distance reordering.",
        "Furthermore, this model is formalised as Tree Substitution Grammars, so it observes syntactic cohesion.",
        "Syntactic cohesion means that the translation of a string covered by a subtree in a source parse tends to be continuous.",
        "Fox (2002) shows that translation between English and French satisfies cohesion in the majority cases.",

        "But unfortunately, the tree-to-string model requires each node must be strictly matched during rule matching, which makes it strongly dependent on the relationship of tree nodes and their roles in the whole sentence.",

        "In this paper, we present a hierarchical chunk-to-string translation model to combine the merits of the two models.",

        "Our model can combine the merits of both the models: employing linguistic syntax to direct decoding, being syntax cohesive and robust to parsing errors.",
        "We refine the hierarchical chunk-to-string model into two models: a loose model (more similar to the hierarchical phrase-based model) and a tight model (more similar to the tree-to-string model).",
        "Our experiments show that our decoder can improve translation performance significantly over the hierarchical phrase-based decoder and the tree-to-string decoder.",
        "Besides, the loose model gives a better performance while the tight model gives a faster speed."
