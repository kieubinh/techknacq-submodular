        "Factorization is crucial to discriminative parsing.",
        "Previous discriminative parsing models usually factor a parse tree into a set of parts.",
        "Each part is scored separately to ensure tractability.",
        "In dependency parsing (DP), the number of dependencies in a part is called the order of a DP model (Koo and Collins, 2010).",
        "Accordingly, existing graph-based DP models can be categorized into tree groups, namely, the first-order (Eisner, 1996; McDonald et al., 2005a; McDonald et al., 2005b), second-order (McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Carreras, 2007) and third-order (Koo and Collins, 2010) models.",
        "Similarly, we can define the order of constituent parsing in terms of the number of grammar rules in a part.",
        "Then, the previous discriminative constituent parsing models (Johnson, 2001; Henderson, 2004; Taskar et al., 2004; Petrov and Klein, 2008a; ?The research reported in this paper was partially supported by the Research Grants Council of HKSAR, China, through the GRF Grant 9041597 (CityU 144410).",
        "Petrov and Klein, 2008b; Finkel et al., 2008) are the first-order ones, because there is only one grammar rule in a part.",
        "The discriminative re-scoring models (Collins, 2000; Collins and Duffy, 2002; Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Huang, 2008) can be viewed as previous attempts to higher-order constituent parsing, using some parts containing more than one grammar rule as non-local features.",
        "In this paper, we present a higher-order constituent parsing model1 based on these previous works.",
        "It allows multiple adjacent grammar rules in each part of a parse tree, so as to utilize more local structural context to decide the plausibility of a grammar rule instance.",
        "Evaluated on the PTB WSJ and Chinese Treebank, it achieves its best F1 scores of 91.86% and 85.58%, respectively.",
        "Combined with other high-performance parsers under the framework of constituent recombination (Sagae and Lavie, 2006; Fossum and Knight, 2009), this model further enhances the F1 scores to 92.80% and 85.60%, the highest ones achieved so far on these two data sets."
