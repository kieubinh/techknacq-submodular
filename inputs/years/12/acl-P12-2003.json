        "Fortunately, it comes with much headroom for improving accuracy, including a tunable margin parameter C for the classifier, richer feature sets (Zhang and Nivre, 2011) and ensemble models (Surdeanu and Manning, 2010).",

        "We also considered the 11Berkeley's performance suffered with jackknifed tags (76.5 versus 77.0%), possibly because it parses and tags better jointly.",
        "12Although Mate's performance was not significantly better than Berkeley's in our setting, it has the potential to tap richer features and other advantages of dependency parsers (Nivre and McDonald, 2008) to further boost accuracy, which may be difficult in the generative framework of a typical constituent parser.",

        "However, this tool relies on function tag information from the CTB in determining dependency relations.",
        "Since these tags usually cannot be produced by constituent parsers, we could not, in turn, obtain CoNLL-style dependency trees from their output.",
        "This points to another advantage of dependency parsers: they need only the dependency tree corpus to train and can conveniently make use of native (unconverted) corpora, such as the Chinese Dependency Treebank (Liu et al., 2006).",
