        "In social psychology, it is generally accepted that one discloses more of his/her personal information to someone in a strong relationship.",

        "Our framework uses text mining techniques to discover topics, emotions, sentiments, lexical patterns, as well as personally identifiable information (PII) and personally embarrassing information (PEI).",

        "We often self-disclose, that is, share our emotions, personal information, and secrets, with our friends, family, coworkers, and even strangers.",
        "Social psychologists say that the degree of self-disclosure in a relationship depends on the strength of the relationship, and strategic self-disclosure can strengthen the relationship (Duck, 2007).",
        "In this paper, we study whether relationship strength has the same effect on self-disclosure of Twitter users.",
        "To do this, we first present a method for computational analysis of self-disclosure in online conversations and show promising results.",
        "To accommodate the largely unannotated nature of online conversation data, we take a topic-model based approach (Blei et al., 2003) for discovering latent patterns that reveal self-disclosure.",
        "A similar approach was able to discover sentiments (Jo and Oh, 2011) and emotions (Kim et al., 2012) from user contents.",
        "Prior work on self-disclosure for online social networks has been from communications research (Jiang et al., 2011; Humphreys et al., 2010) which relies on human judgements for analyzing self-disclosure.",
        "The limitation of such research is that the data is small, so our approach of automatic analysis of self-disclosure will be able to show robust results over a much larger data set.",
        "Analyzing relationship strength in online social networks has been done for Facebook and Twitter in (Gilbert and Karahalios, 2009; Gilbert, 2012) and for enterprise SNS (Wu et al., 2010).",
        "In this paper, we estimate relationship strength simply based on the duration and frequency of interaction.",
        "We then look at the correlation between self-disclosure and relationship strength and present the preliminary results that show a positive and significant correlation."

        "We asked the Turkers to read the conversation chains representing the topics discovered by LDA and have them mark the conversations that contain PII and PEI.",

        "We looked at the relationship strength in Twitter conversational partners and how much they self-disclose to each other.",
        "We found that people disclose more to closer friends, confirming the social psychology studies, but people show more positive sentiment to weak relationships rather than strong relationships.",
        "This reflects the social norm toward first-time acquaintances on Twitter.",
        "Also, emotional openness does not change significantly with relationship strength.",
        "We think this may be due to the inherent difficulty in truly identifying the emotions on Twitter.",
        "Identifying emotion merely based on keywords captures mostly shallow emotions, and deeper emotional openness either does not occur much on",
        "lationship that shows a high degree of self-disclosure.",
        "Twitter or cannot be captures very well.",
        "With our automatic analysis, we showed that when Twitter users have conversations, they control self-disclosure depending on the relationship strength.",
        "We showed the results of measuring the relationship strength of a Twitter conversational dyad with chain frequency and length.",
        "We also showed the results of automatically analyzing self-disclosure behaviors using topic modeling.",
        "This is ongoing work, and we are looking to improve methods for analyzing relationship strength and self-disclosure, especially emotions, PII and PEI.",
        "For relationship strength, we will consider not only interaction frequency, but also network distance and relationship duration.",
        "For finding emotions, first we will adapt existing models (Vaassen and Daele-mans, 2011; Tokuhisa et al., 2008) and suggest a new semi-supervised model.",
        "For finding PII and PEI, we will not only consider the topics, but also time, place and the structure of questions and answers.",
        "This paper is a starting point that has shown some promising research directions for an important problem."
