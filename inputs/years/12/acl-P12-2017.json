        "If the observations are conditionally independent given the hypothesis, one can simply take the posterior at time step t as the prior for the posterior update at time step t+ 1.",
        "Here, each particle corresponds to a specific segmentation of the data observed so far, or more precisely, the specific CRP seating of word tokens in this segmentation; we refer to this as its history.",
        "Its weight indicates how well a particle is supported by the data, and each observation corresponds to an unsegmented utterance.",

        "To get the particles at time t+1 from the particles at time t, update each particle using the observation at time t+1 as follows: sample a segmentation for this observation, given the particle's history, then add the words in this segmentation to that history.",
        "After each particle has been updated, their weights are adjusted to reflect how well they are now supported by the observations.",
        "The set of updated and reweighted particles constitutes the approximation of the posterior at time t+ 1.",
        "To overcome the problem of degeneracy (the situation where only very few particles have non-negligible weights), Bo?rschinger and Johnson use",
        "resampling; basically, high-probability particles are permitted to have multiple descendants that can replace low-probability particles.",
        "For reasons of space, we refer the reader to Bo?rschinger and Johnson (2011) for the details of these steps.",
        "While necessary to address the degeneracy problem, resampling leads to a loss of sample diversity; very quickly, almost all particles have an identical history, descending from only a small number of (previously) high probability particles.",
        "With a strict online learning constraint, this can only be counteracted by using an extremely large number of particles.",
        "An alternative strategy which we explore here is to use rejuvenation; the core idea is to restore sample diversity after each resampling step by performing MCMC resampling steps on each particle's history, thus leading to particles with different histories in each generation, even if they all have the same parent.",
        "(e.g., Canini et al. (2009)) This makes it necessary to store previously processed observations and thus no longer qualifies as online learning in a strict sense, but it still yields an incremental algorithm that learns as the observations arrive sequentially, instead of delaying learning until all observations are available.",
        "In our setting, rejuvenation works as follows.",
        "After each resampling step, for each particle the algorithm performs a fixed number of the following re",
        "juvenation steps: 1. randomly choose a previously observed utterance 2. resample the segmentation for this utterance",
        "and update the particle accordingly For the resampling step, we use Mochihashi et al. (2009)'s algorithm to efficiently sample segmentations for an unsegmented utterance o, given a sequence of n previously observed words W1:n. As the CRP is exchangeable, during resampling we can treat every utterance as if it were the last, making it possible to use this algorithm for any utterance, irrespective of its actual position in the data.",
        "Crucially, however, the distribution over segmentations that this algorithm samples from is not the true posterior distribution P (?|o, ?,W1:n) as defined by the CRP, but a slightly different proposal distribution Q(?|o, ?,W1:n) that does not take into account the intra-sentential word dependencies for a segmentation of o.",
        "It is precisely because we ignore these dependencies that an efficient dynamic programming algorithm is possible, but because Q is different from the target conditional distribution P , our algorithm that uses Q instead of P needs to correct for this.",
        "In a particle filter, this is done when the particle weights are calculated (Bo?rschinger and Johnson, 2011).",
        "For an MCMC algorithm or our rejuvenation step, a Metropolis-Hastings accept/reject step is required, as described in detail by Johnson et al. (2007) in the context of grammatical inference.1 In our case, during rejuvenation an utterance u with current segmentation s is reanalyzed as follows: ?",
