        "We propose an improved, bottom-up method for converting CCG derivations into PTB-style phrase structure trees.",
        "In contrast with past work (Clark and Curran, 2009), which used simple transductions on category pairs, our approach uses richer transductions attached to single categories.",
        "Our conversion preserves more sentences under round-trip conversion (51.1% vs. 39.6%) and is more robust.",
        "In particular, unlike past methods, ours does not require ad-hoc rules over non-local features, and so can be easily integrated into a parser."

        "Converting the Penn Treebank (PTB, Marcus et al., 1993) to other formalisms, such as HPSG (Miyao et al., 2004), LFG (Cahill et al., 2008), LTAG (Xia, 1999), and CCG (Hockenmaier, 2003), is a complex process that renders linguistic phenomena in formalism-specific ways.",
        "Tools for reversing these conversions are desirable for downstream parser use and parser comparison.",
        "However, reversing conversions is difficult, as corpus conversions may lose information or smooth over PTB inconsistencies.",
        "Clark and Curran (2009) developed a CCG to PTB conversion that treats the CCG derivation as a phrase structure tree and applies hand-crafted rules to every pair of categories that combine in the derivation.",
        "Because their approach does not exploit the generalisations inherent in the CCG formalism, they must resort to ad-hoc rules over non-local features of the CCG constituents being combined (when a fixed pair of CCG categories correspond to multiple PTB structures).",
        "Even with such rules, they correctly convert only 39.6% of gold CCGbank derivations.",
        "Our conversion assigns a set of bracket instructions to each word based on its CCG category, then follows the CCG derivation, applying and combining instructions at each combinatory step to build a phrase structure tree.",
        "This requires specific instructions for each category (not all pairs), and generic operations for each combinator.",
        "We cover all categories in the development set and correctly convert 51.1% of sentences.",
        "Unlike Clark and Curran's approach, we require no rules that consider non-local features of constituents, which enables the possibility of simple integration with a CKY-based parser.",
        "The most common errors our approach makes involve nodes for clauses and rare spans such as QPs, NXs, and NACs.",
        "Many of these errors are inconsistencies in the original PTB annotations that are not recoverable.",
        "These issues make evaluating parser output difficult, but our method does enable an improved comparison of CCG and PTB parsers."

        "Combinators define how adjacent categories can combine.",
        "Figure 1 uses function application, where a complex category consumes an adjacent argument to form its result, e.g. S [dcl ]\\NP combines with the NP to its left to form an S [dcl ].",
        "More powerful combinators allow categories to combine with greater flexibility.",
        "We cannot form a PTB tree by simply relabeling the categories in a CCG derivation because the mapping to phrase labels is many-to-many, CCG derivations contain extra brackets due to binarisation, and there are cases where the constituents in the PTB tree and the CCG derivation cross (e.g. in Figure 1)."

        "We have sixteen special cases for non-combinatory binary rules and twelve special cases for non-combinatory unary rules.",
