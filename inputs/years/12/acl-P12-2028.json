        "To date, many unsupervised WSD systems rely on a sense similarity module that returns a similarity score given two senses.",
        "Many similarity measures use the taxonomy structure of WordNet [WN] (Fellbaum, 1998), which allows only noun-noun and verb-verb pair similarity computation since the other parts of speech (adjectives and adverbs) do not have a taxonomic representation structure.",
        "For example, the jcn similarity measure (Jiang and Conrath, 1997) computes the sense pair similarity score based on the information content of three senses: the two senses and their least common subsumer in the noun/verb hierarchy.",
        "The most popular sense similarity measure is the Extended Lesk [elesk] measure (Banerjee and Peder-sen, 2003).",
        "In elesk, the similarity score is computed based on the length of overlapping words/phrases between two extended dictionary definitions.",
        "The definitions are extended by definitions of neighbor senses to discover more overlapping words.",
        "However, exact word matching is lossy.",
        "Below are two definitions from WN: bank#n#1: a financial institution that accepts deposits and channels the money into lending activities stock#n#1: the capital raised by a corporation through the issue of shares entitling holders to an ownership interest (equity) Despite the high semantic relatedness of the two senses, the overlapping words in the two definitions are only a, the, leading to a very low similarity score.",
        "Accordingly we are interested in extracting latent semantics from sense definitions to improve elesk.",
        "However, the challenge lies in that sense definitions are typically too short/sparse for latent variable models to learn accurate semantics, since these models are designed for long documents.",
        "For example, topic models such as LDA (Blei et al., 2003), can only find the dominant topic based on the observed words in a definition (financial topic in bank#n#1 and stock#n#1) without further discernibility.",
        "In this case, many senses will share the same latent semantics profile, as long as they are in the same topic/domain.",
        "To solve the sparsity issue we use missing words as negative evidence of latent semantics, as in (Guo and Diab, 2012).",
        "We define missing words of a sense definition as the whole vocabulary in a corpus minus the observed words in the sense definition.",
        "Since observed words in definitions are too few to reveal the semantics of senses, missing words can be used to tell the model what the definition is not about.",
        "Therefore, we want to find a latent semantics profile that is related to observed words in a definition, but also not related to missing words, so that the induced latent semantics is unique for the sense.",
        "Finally we also show how to use WN neighbor sense definitions to construct a nuanced sense similarity wmfvec, based on the inferred latent semantic vectors of senses.",
        "We show that wmfvec outperforms elesk and LDA based approaches in four All-words WSD data sets.",

        "Assume there are 3 dimensions in our latent model: financial, sport, institution.",
        "We use Rvo to denote the sum of relatedness between latent vector v and all observed words; similarly, Rvm is the sum of relatedness between the vector v and all missing words.",
        "Hypothesis v1 is given by topic models, where only the financial dimension is found, and it has the maximum relatedness to observed words in bank#n#1 definition Rv1o = 20. v2 is the ideal latent vector, since it also detects that bank#n#1 is related to institution.",
        "It has a slightly smaller Rv2o = 18, but more importantly, its relatedness to missing words, Rv2m = 300, is substantially smaller than Rv1m = 600.",
        "However, we cannot simply choose a hypothesis with the maximum Ro ?Rm value, since v3, which is clearly not related to bank#n#1 but with a minimum Rm = 100, will therefore be (erroneously) returned as the answer.",

        "We choose the Indegree algorithm used in (Sinha and Mihalcea, 2007; Guo and Diab, 2010) as our disambiguation algorithm.",
