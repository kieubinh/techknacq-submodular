        "One of the main reasons why tense/aspect error correction is difficult is that the choice of tense/aspect is highly dependent on global context.",
        "Previous research on grammatical error correction typically uses pointwise prediction that performs classification on each word independently, and thus fails to capture the information of neigh-boring labels.",
        "In order to take global information into account, we regard the task as sequence labeling: each verb phrase in a document is labeled with tense/aspect depending on surrounding labels.",

        "Because of the growing number of learners of English, there is an increasing demand to help learners of English.",

        "However, manual feedback needs a lot of work and time, and it also requires much grammatical knowledge.",
        "Thus, a variety of automatic methods for helping English learning and education have been proposed.",
        "The mainstream of English error detection and correction has focused on article errors (Knight and Chander, 1994; Brockett et al., 2006) and preposition errors (Chodorow et al., 2007; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2011), that commonly occur in essays by ESL learners.",
        "On the other hand, tense and aspect errors have been little studied, even though they are also commonly found in learners?",
        "essays (Lee and Sen-eff, 2006; Bitchener et al., 2005).",
        "For instance, Lee (2008) corrects English verb inflection errors, but they do not deal with tense/aspect errors because the choice of tense and aspect highly depends on global context, which makes correction difficult.",
        "Consider the following sentences taken from a corpus of a Japanese learner of English.",
        "(1) I had a good time this Summer Vacation.",
        "First, I *go to KAIYUKAN 1 with my friends.",
        "In this example, go in the second sentence should be written as went.",
        "It is difficult to correct this type of error because there are two choices for correction, namely went and will go.",
        "In this case, we can exploit global context to determine which correction is appropriate: the first sentence describes a past event, and the second sentence refers the first sentence.",
        "Thus, the verb should be changed to past tense.",
        "This deduction is easy for humans, but is difficult for machines.",
        "One way to incorporate such global context into tense/aspect error correction is to use a machine learning-based sequence labeling approach.",
        "Therefore, we regard the task as sequence labeling: each verb phrase in the document is labeled with tense/aspect depending on surrounding labels.",
        "This model naturally takes global context into account.",

        "Developing a high-quality tense and aspect error correction system requires a large corpus annotated with tense/aspect errors.",
