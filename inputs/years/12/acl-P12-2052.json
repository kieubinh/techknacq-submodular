        "Authorship attribution (AA) has attracted much attention due to its many applications in, e.g., computer forensics, criminal law, military intelligence, and humanities research (Stamatatos, 2009).",
        "The traditional problem, which is the focus of our work, is to attribute test texts of unknown authorship to one of a set of known authors, whose training texts are supplied in advance (i.e., a supervised classification problem).",
        "While most of the early work on AA focused on formal texts with only a few possible authors, researchers have recently turned their attention to informal texts and tens to thousands of authors (Koppel et al., 2011).",
        "In parallel, topic models have gained popularity as a means of analysing such large text corpora (Blei, 2012).",
        "In (Seroussi et al., 2011), we showed that methods based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) ?",
        "a popular topic model by Blei et al. (2003) ?",
        "yield good AA performance.",
        "However, LDA does not model authors explicitly, and we are not aware of any previous studies that apply author-aware topic models to traditional AA.",
        "This paper aims to address this gap.",
        "In addition to being the first (to the best of our knowledge) to apply Rosen-Zvi et al's (2004) Author-Topic Model (AT) to traditional AA, the main contribution of this paper is our Disjoint Author-Document Topic Model (DADT), which addresses AT's limitations in the context of AA.",
        "We show that DADT outperforms AT, LDA, and linear support vector machines on AA with many authors."

        "Background.",
        "Our definition of DADT is motivated by the observation that when authors write texts on the same issue, specific words must be used (e.g., texts about LDA are likely to contain the words ?topic?",
        "and ?prior?",
        "), while other words vary in frequency according to author style.",
        "Also, texts by the same author share similar style markers, independently of content (Koppel et al., 2009).",
        "DADT aims to separate document words from author words by generating them from two disjoint topic sets of T (D) document topics and T (A) author topics.",
        "Lacoste-Julien et al. (2008) and Ramage et al. (2009) (among others) also used disjoint topic sets to represent document labels, and Chemudugunta et al. (2006) separated corpus-level topics from document-specific words.",
        "However, we are unaware of any applications of these ideas to AA.",
        "The closest work we know of is by Mimno and McCallum (2008), whose DMR model outperformed AT in AA",
        "of multi-authored texts (DMR does not use disjoint topic sets).",
        "We use AT rather than DMR, since we found that AT outperforms DMR in AA of single-authored texts, which are the focus of this paper.",
        "The Model.",
        "Figure 1 shows DADT's graphical representation, with document-related parameters on the left (the LDA component), and author-related parameters on the right (the AT component).",
        "We define the model for single-authored texts, but it can be easily extended to multi-authored texts.",
        "The generative process for DADT is described below.",
        "We use D and C to denote the Dirichlet and categorical distributions respectively, and A, D and V to denote the number of authors, documents, and unique vocabulary words respectively.",
        "In addition, we mark each step as coming from either LDA or AT, or as new in DADT.",
        "Global level: L. For each document topic t, draw a word dis",
        "D. Draw a distribution over authors ?",
        "?",
        "D (?",

        "DADT versus AT.",

        "authors, as described by Rosen-Zvi et al. (2010) (i.e., AT trained with an additional unique ?fictitious?",
        "author for each document, allowing it to adapt to individual documents and not only to authors).",
        "However, there are several key differences between DADT and AT.",
        "First, in DADT author topics are disjoint from document topics, with different priors for each topic set.",
        "Thus, the number of author topics can be different from the number of document topics, enabling us to vary the number of author topics according to the number of authors in the corpus.",
        "Second, DADT places different priors on the word distributions for author topics and document topics (?",
        "(A) and ?",
        "(D) respectively).",
        "Stopwords are known to be strong indicators of authorship (Koppel et al., 2009), and DADT allows us to use this knowledge by assigning higher weights to the elements of ?",
        "(A) that correspond to stopwords than to such elements in ?(D).",
        "Third, DADT learns the ratio between document words and author words on a per-document basis, and makes it possible to specify a prior belief of what this ratio should be.",
        "We found that specifying a prior belief that about 80% of each document is composed of author words yielded better results than using AT's approach, which evenly splits each document into author and document words.",
        "Fourth, DADT defines the process that generates authors.",
        "This allows us to consider the number of texts by each author when performing AA.",
        "This also enables the potential use of DADT in a semi-supervised setting by training on unlabelled texts, which we plan to explore in the future."

        "This approach uses the Hellinger distances of topic distributions to assign test texts to the closest author.",

        "These splits allow DADT to de-noise the author representations by allocating document words to a relatively small number of document topics.",

        "Our DADT model yielded the best results in all cases (the differences between DADT and the other methods are statistically significant according to a paired two-tailed t-test with p < 0.05).",
        "We attribute DADT's superior performance to the de-noising effect of the disjoint topic sets, which appear to yield author representations of higher predictive quality than those of the other models.",
        "As expected, AT significantly outperformed LDA-H. On the other hand, AT-FA performed much worse than all the other methods on PAN?11, probably because of the inherent noisiness in using the same topics to model both authors and documents.",

        "DADT's PAN?11 testing result is close to the third-best accuracy from the PAN?11 competition (Argamon and Juola, 2011).",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge, DADT obtained the best accuracy for a fully-supervised method that uses only unigram features.",
        "Specifically, Kourtis and Stamatatos (2011), who obtained the highest accuracy (65.8%), assumed that all the test texts are given to the classifier at the same time, and used this additional information with a semi-supervised method; while Kern et al. (2011) and Tanguy et al. (2011), who obtained the second-best (64.2%) and third-best (59.4%) accuracies respectively, used various feature types (e.g., features obtained from parse trees).",
        "Further, preprocessing differences make it hard to compare the methods on a level playing field.",
        "Nonetheless, we note that extending DADT to enable semi-supervised classification and additional feature types are promising future work directions.",
        "While all the methods yielded relatively low accuracies on Blog due to its size, topic-based methods were more strongly affected than SVM by the transition from the 1,000 author subset to the full dataset.",
        "This is probably because topic-based methods use a single model, making them more sensitive to corpus size than SVM's one-versus-all setup that uses one model per author.",
        "Notably, an oracle that chooses the correct answer between SVM and DADT when they disagree yields an accuracy of 37.15% on the full dataset, suggesting it is worthwhile to explore ensembles that combine the outputs of SVM and DADT (we tried using DADT topics as additional SVM features, but this did not outperform DADT)."
