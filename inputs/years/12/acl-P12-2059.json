        "Statistical machine translation (SMT) systems, require parallel corpora of sentences and their translations, called bitexts, which are often not sufficiently large.",
        "However, for many closely-related languages, SMT can be carried out even with small bitexts by exploring relations below the word level.",
        "Closely-related languages such as Macedonian and Bulgarian exhibit a large overlap in their vocabulary and strong syntactic and lexical similarities.",
        "Spelling conventions in such related languages can still be different, and they may diverge more substantially at the level of morphology.",
        "However, the differences often constitute consistent regularities that can be generalized when translating.",
        "The language similarities and the regularities in morphological variation and spelling motivate the use of character-level translation models, which were applied to translation (Vilar et al., 2007; Tiedemann, 2009a) and transliteration (Matthews, 2007)."

        "Certainly, translation cannot be adequately mod-eled as simple transliteration, even for closely-related languages.",
        "However, the strength of phrase-based SMT (Koehn et al., 2003) is that it can support rather large sequences (phrases) that capture translations of entire chunks.",
        "This makes it possible to include mappings that go far beyond the edit-distance-based string operations usually modeled in transliteration.",
        "Table 1 shows how character-level phrase tables can cover mappings spanning over multi-word units.",
        "Thus, character-level phrase-based SMT models combine the generality of character-by-character transliteration and lexical mappings of larger units that could possibly refer to morphemes, words or phrases, as well as to various combinations thereof."

        "We map character n-gram alignments to links between single characters before extraction.",

        "Then, following (Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Wu and Wang, 2007; Utiyama and Isahara, 2007), we induced conditional lexical translation probabilities",

        "We calculated a similar quantity Dir(m, b), where the probabilities Pr(m|b) and Pr(b|m) are estimated using maximum likelihood from the MK?BG bitext directly.",
        "Finally, we calculated the similarity score S(m, b) = Piv(m, b)+Dir(m, b)+2?LCSR(m, b), where LCSR is the longest common subsequence of two strings, divided by the length of the longer one.",
        "The score S(m, b) is high for words that are likely to be cognates, i.e., that (i) have high probability of being mutual translations, which is expressed by the first two terms in the summation, and (ii) have similar spelling, as expressed by the last term.",
        "Here we give equal weight to Dir(m, b) and Piv(m, b); we also give equal weights to the translational similarity (the sum of the first two terms) and to the spelling similarity (twice LCSR).",
        "We excluded all words of length less than three, as well as all Macedonian-Bulgarian word pairs (m, b) for which Piv(m, b) + Dir(m, b) < 0.01, and those for which LCSR(m, b) was below 0.58, a value found by Kondrak et al. (2003) to work well for a number of European language pairs.",
        "Finally, using S(m, b), we induced a weighted bipartite graph, and we performed a greedy approximation to the maximum weighted bipartite matching in that graph using competitive linking (Melamed, 2000), to produce the final list of cognate pairs.",
        "Note that the above-described cognate extraction algorithm has three important components: (1) orthographic, based on LCSR, (2) semantic, based",
        "on word alignments and pivoting over English, and (3) competitive linking.",
        "The orthographic component is essential when looking for cognates since they must have similar spelling by definition, while",
