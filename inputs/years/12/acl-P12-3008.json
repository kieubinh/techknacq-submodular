        "In the future, other formats can easily be integrated in our modular implementation.",
        "Validation of such a variety of formats is important.",
        "Therefore among others, we included XML/DTD validation, text encoding detection software, and language identification tools with pre-trained models for over 60 languages.",

        "Import processes automatically align translated documents with each other using standard length-based sentence alignment methods (Gale and Church, 1993; Varga et al., 2005).",
