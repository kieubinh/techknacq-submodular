        "In recent years research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been steadily moving towards multilingual processing: the availability of ever growing amounts of text in different languages, in fact, has been a major driving force behind research on multilingual approaches, from morphosyntactic (Das and Petrov, 2011) and syntacticosemantic (Peirsman and Pado?, 2010) phenomena to high-end tasks like textual entailment (Mehdad et al., 2011) and sentiment analysis (Lu et al., 2011).",
        "These research trends would seem to indicate the time is ripe for developing methods capable of performing semantic analysis of texts written in any language: however, this objective is still far from being attained, as is demonstrated by research in a core language understanding task such as Word Sense Disambiguation (Navigli, 2009, WSD) continuing to be focused primarily on English.",
        "While the lack of resources has hampered the development of effective multilingual approaches to WSD, recently this idea has been revamped with the organization of SemEval tasks on cross-lingual WSD (Lefever and Hoste, 2010) and cross-lingual lexical substitution (Mihalcea et al., 2010).",
        "In addition, new research on the topic has explored the translation of sentences into many languages (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2010; Lefever et al., 2011; Banea and Mihalcea, 2011), as well as the projection of monolingual knowledge onto another language (Khapra et al., 2011).",
        "In our research we focus on knowledge-based methods and tools for multilingual WSD, since knowledge-rich WSD has been shown to achieve high performance across domains (Agirre et al., 2009; Navigli et al., 2011) and to compete with supervised methods on a variety of lexical disambiguation tasks (Ponzetto and Navigli, 2010).",
        "Our vision of knowledge-rich multilingual WSD requires two fundamental components: first, a wide-coverage multilingual lexical knowledge base; second, tools to effectively query, retrieve and exploit its information for disambiguation.",
        "Nevertheless, to date, no integrated resources and tools exist that are freely available to the research community on a multilingual scale.",
        "Previous endeavors are either not freely available (EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998)), or are only accessible via a Web interface (cf. the Multilingual Research Repository (Atserias et al., 2004) and MENTA (de Melo and Weikum, 2010)), thus providing no programmatic access.",
        "And this is despite the fact that the availability of easy-to-use libraries for efficient information access is known to foster top-level research ?",
        "cf. the widespread use of semantic similarity measures in NLP, thanks to the availability of WordNet::Similarity (Peder-sen et al., 2004).",
        "With the present contribution we aim to fill this gap in multilingual tools, providing a multi-tiered contribution consisting of (a) an Application Programming Interface (API) for efficiently accessing the information available in BabelNet (Navigli and",
        "Ponzetto, 2010), a very large knowledge repository with concept lexicalizations in 6 languages (Catalan, English, French, German, Italian and Spanish), at the lexicographic (i.e., word senses), encyclope-dic (i.e., named entities) and conceptual (i.e., concepts and semantic relations) levels; (b) an API to perform graph-based WSD with BabelNet, thus providing, for the first time, a freely-available toolkit for performing knowledge-basedWSD in a multilingual and cross-lingual setting."

        "which automatically integrates fine-grained lexicographic information with large amounts of encyclopedic knowledge by means of a high-performing mapping algorithm (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2010).",
        "In addition to this conceptual backbone, BabelNet provides a multilingual lexical dimension.",

        "In addition, translation relations among lexical items are represented as a mapping from source to target senses ?",

        "Finally, semantic relations are encoded using WordNet's pointers and an additional symbol for Wikipedia relations (r), which can also specify the source of the relation (e.g., FROM IT means that the relation was harvested from the Italian Wikipedia).",
