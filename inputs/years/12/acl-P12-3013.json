        "These abilities make BIUTEE an appealing RTE system for two research communities: (1) researchers of end applications, that can benefit from generic textual inference, and (2) RTE researchers, who can integrate their novel algorithms and knowledge resources into our system, saving the time and effort of developing a complete RTE system from scratch.",

        "Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) is the task of identifying, given two text fragments, whether one of them can be inferred from the other (Dagan et al., 2006).",
        "This task generalizes a common problem that arises in many tasks at the semantic level of NLP.",
        "For example, in Information Extraction (IE), a system may be given a template with variables (e.g., ?X is employed by Y?)",
        "and has to find text fragments from which this template, with variables replaced by proper entities, can be inferred.",
        "In Summariza-tion, a good summary should be inferred from the",
        "given text, and, in addition, should not contain duplicated information, i.e., sentences which can be inferred from other sentences in the summary.",
        "Detecting these inferences can be performed by an RTE system.",
        "Since first introduced, several approaches have been proposed for this task, ranging from shallow lexical similarity methods (e.g., (Clark and Harrison, 2010; MacKinlay and Baldwin, 2009)), to complex linguistically-motivated methods, which incorporate extensive linguistic analysis (syntactic parsing, coreference resolution, semantic role labelling, etc.)",
        "and a rich inventory of linguistic and world-knowledge resources (e.g., (Iftene, 2008; de Salvo Braz et al., 2005; Bar-Haim et al., 2007)).",
        "Building such complex systems requires substantial development efforts, which might become a barrier for newcomers to RTE research.",
        "Thus, flexible and extensible publicly available RTE systems are expected to significantly facilitate research in this field.",
        "More concretely, two major research communities would benefit from a publicly available RTE system: 1.",
        "Higher-level application developers, who would use an RTE system to solve inference tasks in their application.",
        "RTE systems for this type of researchers should be adaptable for the application specific data: they should be configurable, trainable, and extensible with inference knowledge that captures application-specific phenomena.",
        "2.",
        "Researchers in the RTE community, that would not need to build a complete RTE system for their research.",
        "Rather, they may integrate",
        "their novel research components into an existing open-source system.",
        "Such research efforts might include developing knowledge resources, developing inference components for specific phenomena such as temporal inference, or extending RTE to different languages.",
        "A flexible and extensible RTE system is expected to encourage researchers to create and share their textual-inference components.",
        "A good example from another research area is the Moses system for Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) (Koehn et al., 2007), which provides the core SMT components while being extended with new research components by a large scientific community.",
        "Yet, until now rather few and quite limited RTE systems were made publicly available.",
        "Moreover, these systems are restricted in the types of knowledge resources which they can utilize, and in the scope of their inference algorithms.",
        "For example, EDITS2 (Kouylekov and Negri, 2010) is a distance-based RTE system, which can exploit only lexical knowledge resources.",
        "NutCracker3 (Bos and Mark-ert, 2005) is a system based on logical representation and automatic theorem proving, but utilizes only WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) as a lexical knowledge resource.",
        "Therefore, we provide our open-source textual-entailment system, BIUTEE.",
        "Our system provides state-of-the-art linguistic analysis tools and exploits various types of manually built and automatically acquired knowledge resources, including lexical, lexical-syntactic and syntactic rewrite rules.",
        "Furthermore, the system components, including preprocessing utilities, knowledge resources, and even the steps of the inference algorithm, are modular, and can be replaced or extended easily with new components.",
        "Extensibility and flexibility are also supported by a plug-in mechanism, by which new inference components can be integrated without changing existing code.",
        "Notable support for researchers is provided by a visual tracing tool, Tracer, which visualizes every step of the inference process as shown in Figures 2"

        "In this section we provide a high level description of the inference components.",
        "Further details of the algorithmic components appear in references provided throughout this section.",
        "BIUTEE follows the transformation based paradigm, which recognizes textual entailment by converting the text into the hypothesis via a sequence of transformations.",
        "Such a sequence is often referred to as a proof, and is performed, in our system, over the syntactic representation of the text - the text's parse tree(s).",
        "A transformation modifies a given parse tree, resulting in a generation of a new parse tree, which can be further modified by subsequent transformations.",
        "Consider, for example, the following text-hypothesis pair: Text: ... Obasanjo invited him to step down as president ... and accept political asylum in Nigeria.",
        "Hypothesis: Charles G. Taylor was offered asylum in Nigeria.",
        "This text-hypothesis pair requires two major transformations: (1) substituting ?him?",
        "by ?Charles G. Taylor?",
        "via a coreference substitution to an earlier mention in the text, and (2) inferring that if ?X accept Y?",
        "then ?X was offered Y?.",
        "BIUTEE allows many types of transformations, by which any hypothesis can be proven from any text.",
        "Given a TH pair, the system finds a proof which generates H from T, and estimates the proof validity.",
        "The system returns a score which indicates how likely it is that the obtained proof is valid, i.e., the transformations along the proof preserve entailment from the meaning of T. The main type of transformations is application of entailment-rules (Bar-Haim et al., 2007).",
        "An entailment rule is composed of two sub-trees, termed left-hand-side and right-hand-side, and is applied on a parse-tree fragment that matches its left-hand-side, by substituting the left-hand-side with the right-hand-side.",
        "This formalism is simple yet powerful, and captures many types of knowledge.",
        "The simplest type of rules is lexical rules, like car ?",
        "vehicle.",
        "More complicated rules capture the entailment relation between predicate-argument structures, like X accept Y ?",
        "X was offered Y. Entailment rules can also encode syntactic phenomena like the semantic equivalence of active and passive structures (X Verb[active] Y ?",
        "Y is Verb[passive] by X).",
        "Various knowledge resources, represented as entailment rules, are freely available in BIUTEE's web-site.",
        "The complete formalism of entailment rules, adopted by our system, is described in (Bar-Haim et al., 2007).",
        "Coreference relations are utilized via coreference-substitution transformations: one mention of an entity is replaced by another mention of the same entity, based on coreference relations.",
        "In the above example the system could apply such a transformation to substitute ?him?",
        "with ?Charles G. Taylor?.",
        "Since applications of entailment rules and coreference substitutions are yet, in most cases, insufficient in transforming T into H, our system allows on-the-fly transformations.",
        "These transformations include insertions of missing nodes, flipping parts-of-speech, moving sub-trees, etc.",
        "(see (Stern and Dagan, 2011) for a complete list of these transformations).",
        "Since these transformations are not justified by given knowledge resources, we use linguistically-motivated features to estimate their validity.",
        "For example, for on-the-fly lexical insertions we consider as features the named-entity annotation of the inserted word, and its probability estimation according to a unigram language model, which yields lower costs for more frequent words.",
        "Given a (T,H) pair, the system applies a search algorithm (Stern et al., 2012) to find a proof O = (o1, o2, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "on) that transforms T into H. For each proof step oi the system calculates a cost c(oi).",
        "This cost is defined as follows: the system uses a weight-vector w, which is learned in the training phase.",
        "In addition, each transformation oi is represented by a feature vector f(oi) which characterizes the transformation.",
        "The cost c(oi) is defined as w ?",
        "f(oi).",
        "The proof cost is defined as the sum of the costs of the transformations from which it is composed, i.e.:",
        "If the proof cost is below a threshold b, then the system concludes that T entails H. The complete description of the cost model, as well as the method for learning the parameters w and b is described in (Stern and Dagan, 2011)."
