        "Linguistic annotation by means of automatic procedures, such as part-of-speech (POS) tagging, is a backbone of modern corpus linguistics; POS tagged corpora enhance the possibilities of corpus query.",
        "However, many linguistic phenomena are not amenable to automatic annotation and are not readily identifiable on the basis of surface features.",
        "Non-canonical constructions (NCCs), which are the use-case of the tool presented in this paper, are a case in point.",
        "NCCs, of which cleft-sentences are a well-known example, raise a number of issues that prevent their reliable automatic identification in corpora.",
        "Yet, they warrant corpus study due to the relatively low frequency of individual instances, their deviation from canonical construction patterns and frequent ambiguity.",
        "This makes them hard to distinguish from other, seemingly similar constructions.",
        "Expert knowledge is thus required to reliably identify and annotate such phenomena in sufficiently large corpora like the 100 mil.",
        "word British National Corpus (BNC Consortium, 2007).",
        "This necessitates manual annotation which is time-consuming and error-prone when carried out by individual linguists.",
        "To overcome these issues, CSNIPER implements a web-based multi-user annotation scenario in which linguists formulate and refine queries that identify a given linguistic construction in a corpus and assess the query results to distinguish instances of the phenomenon under study (true positives) from such examples that are wrongly identified by the query (false positives).",
        "Each expert linguist thus acts as a rater rather than an annotator.",
        "The tool records assessments made by each rater.",
        "A subsequent evaluation step measures the inter-rater agreement.",
        "The actual annotation step is deferred until after this evaluation in order to achieve high annotation confidence.",
        "proach which entails the following interlinking functionalities (see fig. 1): Query development: Corpus queries can be developed and refined within the tool.",
        "Based on query results which are assessed and labeled by the user, queries can be systematically evaluated and refined for precision.",
        "This transfers some of the ideas of",
        "relevance feedback, which is a common method of improving search results in information retrieval, to a linguistic corpus query system.",
        "Assessment: Query results are presented to the user as a list of sentences with optional additional context; the user assesses and labels each sentence as representing or not representing an instance of the linguistic phenomenon under study.",
        "The tool implements a function that allows the user to comment on decisions and to temporarily mark sentences with uncertain assessments for later review.",
        "Evaluation: Evaluation is a central functionality of CSNIPER serving three purposes.",
        "1) It integrates with the query development by providing feedback to refine queries and improve query precision.",
        "2) It provides information on sentences not labeled consistently by all users, which can be used to review the assessments.",
        "3) It calculates the inter-rater agreement which is used in the corpus annotation step to ensure high annotation confidence.",
        "Corpus annotation: By assessing and labeling query results as correct or wrong, raters provide the tool with their annotation decisions.",
        "CSNIPER annotates the corpus with those annotation decisions that exceed a certain inter-rater agreement threshold.",
        "This annotation-by-query approach of querying, assessing, evaluating and annotating allows multiple distributed raters to incrementally improve query results and achieve high quality annotations.",
        "In this paper, we show how such an approach is well-suited for annotation tasks that require manual analysis over large corpora.",
        "The approach is generalizable to any kind of linguistic phenomena that can be located in corpora on the basis of queries and require manual assessment by multiple expert raters.",
        "In the next two sections, we are providing a more detailed description of the use-case driving the development of CSNIPER (sect.",
