        "The lack of parallel corpora and linguistic resources for many languages and domains is one of the major obstacles for the further advancement of automated translation.",
        "A possible solution is to exploit comparable corpora (non-parallel bi-or multilingual text resources) which are much more widely available than parallel translation data.",
        "Our presented toolkit deals with parallel content extraction from comparable corpora.",
        "It consists of tools bundled in two workflows: (1) alignment of comparable documents and extraction of parallel sentences and (2) extraction and bilingual mapping of terms and named entities.",
        "The toolkit pairs similar bilingual comparable documents and extracts parallel sentences and bilingual terminological and named entity dictionaries from comparable corpora.",
        "This demonstration focuses on the English, Latvian, Lithuanian, and Romanian languages.",
        "Introduction In recent decades, data-driven approaches have significantly advanced the development of machine translation (MT).",
        "However, lack of sufficient bilingual linguistic resources for many languages and domains is still one of the major obstacles for further advancement of automated translation.",
        "At the same time, comparable corpora, i.e., non-parallel bi-or multilingual text resources such as daily news articles and large knowledge bases like Wikipedia, are much more widely available than parallel translation data.",
        "While methods for the use of parallel corpora in machine translation are well studied (Koehn, 2010), similar techniques for comparable corpora have not been thoroughly worked out.",
        "Only the latest research has shown that language pairs and domains with little parallel data can benefit from the exploitation of comparable corpora (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005; Lu et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2010; Abdul-Rauf and Schwenk, 2009 and 2011).",
        "In this paper we present the ACCURAT toolkit1 - a collection of tools that are capable of analysing comparable corpora and extracting parallel data which can be used to improve the performance of statistical and rule/example-based MT systems.",
        "Although the toolkit may be used for parallel data acquisition for open (broad) domain systems, it will be most beneficial for under-resourced languages or specific domains which are not covered by available parallel resources.",
        "The ACCURAT toolkit produces: ?",
        "comparable document pairs with comparability scores, allowing to estimate the overall comparability of corpora; ?",
        "parallel sentences which can be used as additional parallel data sources for statistical translation model learning;",
        "?",
        "terminology dictionaries ?",
        "this type of data is expected to improve domain-dependent translation; ?",
        "named entity dictionaries.",
        "The demonstration showcases two general use case scenarios defined in the toolkit: ?parallel data mining from comparable corpora?",
        "and ?named entity/terminology extraction and mapping from comparable corpora?.",
        "The next section provides a general overview of workflows followed by descriptions of methods and tools integrated in the workflows.",
        "1 Overview of the Workflows The toolkit's tools are integrated within two workflows (visualised in Figure 1).",
        "Figure 1.",
        "Workflows of the ACCURAT toolkit.",
        "The workflow for parallel data mining from comparable corpora aligns comparable corpora in the document level (section 2.1).",
        "This step is crucial as the further steps are computationally intensive.",
        "To minimise search space, documents are aligned with possible candidates that are likely to contain parallel data.",
        "Then parallel sentence pairs are extracted from the aligned comparable corpora (section 2.2).",
        "The workflow for named entity (NE) and terminology extraction and mapping from comparable corpora extracts data in a dictionary-like format.",
        "Providing a list of document pairs, the workflow tags NEs or terms in all documents using language specific taggers (named entity recognisers (NER) or term extractors) and performs multilingual NE (section 2.3) or term mapping (section 2.4), thereby producing bilingual NE or term dictionaries.",
        "The workflow also accepts preprocessed documents, thus skipping the tagging process.",
        "Since all tools use command line interfaces, task automation and workflow specification can be done with simple console/terminal scripts.",
        "All tools can be run on the Windows operating system (some are also platform independent)."

        "We define comparability by how useful a pair of documents is for parallel data extraction.",
        "The higher the comparability score, the more likely two documents contain more overlapping parallel data.",
        "The methods are developed to perform lightweight comparability estimation that minimises search space of relatively large corpora (e.g., 10,000 documents in each language).",
        "There are two comparability metric tools in the toolkit: a translation based and a dictionary based metric.",
        "The Translation based metric (Su and Babych, 2012a) uses MT APIs for document translation into English.",
        "Then four independent similarity feature functions are applied to a document pair: ?",
        "Lexical feature ?",
        "both documents are preprocessed (tokenised, lemmatised, and stop-words are filtered) and then vectorised.",
        "The lexical overlap score is calculated as a cosine similarity functionover the vectors of two documents.",
        "?",
        "Structural feature ?",
        "the difference of sentence counts and content word counts (equally interpolated).",
        "?",
        "Keyword feature ?",
        "the cosine similarity of top 20 keywords.",
        "?",
        "NE feature ?",
        "the cosine similarity of NEs (extracted using Stanford NER).",
        "These similarity measures are linearly combined in a final comparability score.",
        "This is implemented by a simple weighted average strategy, in which each",
        "type of feature is associated with a weight indicating its relative confidence or importance.",
        "The comparability scores are normalised on a scale of 0 to 1, where a higher comparability score indicates a higher comparability level.",
        "The reliability of the proposed metric has been evaluated on a gold standard of comparable corpora for 11 language pairs (Skadi?a et al., 2010).",
        "The gold standard consists of news articles, legal documents, knowledge-base articles, user manuals, and medical documents.",
        "Document pairs in the gold standard were rated by human judges as being parallel, strongly comparable, or weakly comparable.",
        "The evaluation results suggest that the comparability scores reliably reflect comparability levels.",
        "In addition, there is a strong correlation between human defined comparability levels and the confidence scores derived from the comparability metric, as the Pearson R correlation scores vary between 0.966 and 0.999, depending on the language pair.",
        "The Dictionary based metric (Su and Babych, 2012b) is a lightweight approach, which uses bilingual dictionaries to lexically map documents from one language to another.",
        "The dictionaries are automatically generated via word alignment using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) on parallel corpora.",
        "For each word in the source language, the top two translation candidates (based on the word alignment probability in GIZA++) are retrieved as possible translations into the target language.",
        "This metric provides a much faster lexical translation process, although word-for-word lexical mapping produces less reliable translations than MT based translations.",
        "Moreover, the lower quality of text translation in the dictionary based metric does not necessarily degrade its performance in predicting comparability levels of comparable document pairs.",
        "The evaluation on the gold standard shows a strong correlation (between 0.883 and 0.999) between human defined comparability levels and the confidence scores of the metric."

        "In the second step (which is optional),",
        "the resulting candidates are further filtered, and those that do not meet minimum requirements are eliminated.",
        "To work for a certain language pair, LEXACC needs additional resources: (i) a GIZA++-like translation dictionary, (ii) lists of stop-words in both languages, and (iii) lists of word suffixes in both languages (used for stemming).",
        "The performance of LEXACC, regarding precision and recall, can be controlled by a threshold applied to the overall interpolated parallelism score.",
        "The tool has been evaluated on news article comparable corpora.",
