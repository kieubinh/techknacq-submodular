        "Syntax-based statistical machine translation (SMT) systems have achieved promising improvements in recent years.",
        "Depending on the type of input, the systems are divided into two categories: string-based systems whose input is a string to be simultaneously parsed and translated by a synchronous grammar (Wu, 1997; Chiang, 2005; Galley et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008), and tree/forest-based systems whose input is already a parse tree or a packed forest to be directly converted into a target tree or string (Ding and Palmer, 2005; Quirk et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006; Mi et al., 2008; Mi and Huang, 2008; Zhang et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2011a).",
        "?Work done when all the authors were in The University of Tokyo.",
        "Depending on whether or not parsers are explicitly used for obtaining linguistically annotated data during training, the systems are also divided into two categories: formally syntax-based systems that do not use additional parsers (Wu, 1997; Chiang, 2005; Xiong et al., 2006), and linguistically syntax-based systems that use PCFG parsers (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006; Galley et al., 2006; Mi et al., 2008; Mi and Huang, 2008; Zhang et al., 2009), HPSG parsers (Wu et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2011a), or dependency parsers (Ding and Palmer, 2005; Quirk et al., 2005; Shen et al., 2008).",
        "A classification1 of syntax-based SMT systems is shown in Table 1.",
        "Translation rules can be extracted from aligned string-string (Chiang, 2005), tree-tree (Ding and Palmer, 2005) and tree/forest-string (Galley et al., 2004; Mi and Huang, 2008; Wu et al., 2011a) data structures.",
        "Leveraging structural and linguistic information from parse trees/forests, the latter two structures are believed to be better than their string-string counterparts in handling non-local reordering, and have achieved promising translation results.",
        "Moreover, the tree/forest-string structure is more widely used than the tree-tree structure, presumably because using two parsers on the source and target languages is subject to more problems than making use of a parser on one language, such as the shortage of high precision/recall parsers for languages other than English, compound parse error rates, and inconsistency of errors.",
        "In Table 1, note that tree-to-string rules are generic and applicable",
        "All the systems listed here are linguistically syntax-based except the last two (Chiang, 2005) and (Xiong et al., 2006), which are formally syntax-based.",

        "However, few tree/forest-to-string systems have been made open source and this makes it difficult and time-consuming to testify and follow existing proposals involved in recently published papers.",
        "The Akamon system2, written in Java and following the tree/forest-to-string research direction, implements all of the algorithms for both tree-to-string translation rule extraction (Galley et al., 2004; Mi and Huang, 2008; Wu et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2011a) and tree/forest-based decoding (Liu et al., 2006; Mi et al., 2008).",
