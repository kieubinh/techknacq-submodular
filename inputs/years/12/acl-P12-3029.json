        "The Google Books Ngram Corpus (Michel et al., 2011) has enabled the quantitative analysis of linguistic and cultural trends as reflected in millions of books written over the past five centuries.",
        "The corpus consists of words and phrases (i.e., ngrams) and their usage frequency over time.",
        "The data is available for download, and can also be viewed through the interactive Google Books Ngram Viewer at http://books.google.com/ngrams.",
        "The sheer quantity of and broad historical scope of the data has enabled a wide range of analyses (Michel et al., 2011; Ravallion, 2011).",
        "Of course, examining raw ngram frequencies is of limited utility when studying many aspects of linguistic change, particularly the ones related to syntax.",
        "For instance, most English verbs are regular (their past tense is formed by adding -ed), and the few exceptions, known as irregular verbs, tend to regularize over the",
        "time, showing that burned became the dominant spelling around 1880.",
        "Our new syntactic annotations enable a more refined analysis, suggesting that the crossing-point for the verb usage (burned VERB vs. burnt VERB) was decades earlier.",
        "centuries (Lieberman et al., 2007).",
        "Figure 1 illustrates how burned gradually overtook burnt, becoming more frequent around 1880.",
        "Unfortunately, as a study of verb regularization, this analysis is skewed by a significant confound: both words can serve as either verbs (e.g., the house burnt) or adjectives (e.g., the burnt toast).",
        "Because many words have multiple syntactic interpretations, such confounds often limit the utility of raw ngram frequency data.",
        "In this work we provide a new edition of the Google Books Ngram Corpus that contains over 8 million books, or 6% of all books ever published (cf.",
        "Section 3).",
        "Moreover, we include syntactic analysis in order to facilitate a fine-grained analysis of the evolution of syntax.",
        "Ngrams are annotated with part-of-speech tags (e.g., in the phrase he burnt the toast, burnt is a verb; in the burnt toast, burnt is an adjective) and head-modifier dependencies (e.g., in the phrase the little black book, little modifies book).",
        "The annotated ngrams are far more useful for ex",
        "amining the evolution of grammar and syntax.",
        "For our study of the regularization of the verb burn, the availability of syntactic annotations resolves the verb vs. adjective ambiguity in the original data, allowing us to only examine instances where burnt and burned appear as verbs.",
        "This more refined analysis suggests a crossover date for the frequency of the verb forms that is several decades earlier than the overall (verbs and adjectives) crossover.",
        "We use state-of-the-art statistical part-of-speech taggers and dependency parsers to produce syntactic annotations for eight languages in the Google Books collection.",
        "The annotations consist of 12 language universal part-of-speech tags and unlabeled head-modifier dependencies.",
        "Section 4 describes the models that we used and the format of the annotations in detail.",
        "We assess the expected annotation accuracies experimentally and discuss how we adapt the taggers and parsers to historical text in Section 5.",
        "The annotated ngrams are available as a new edition of the Google Books Ngram Corpus; we provide some examples from the new corpus in Figure 3."
