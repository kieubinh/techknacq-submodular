        "When learning a second language, non-native speakers make errors at all levels of linguistic analysis, from pronunciation and intonation to language use.",
        "Word choice errors form a substantial part of all errors made by learners and may also be observed in writing or speech of native speakers.",
        "This category of errors includes homophones.",
        "Some commonly known confusions in English are accept-except, advice-advise, buy-by-bye, ate-eight, to name but a few.",
        "Other errors can be explained by a non-native speaker's inability to distinguish between words because there exists only one corresponding word in their native language.",
        "For example, Portuguese and Spanish speakers have difficulties to differentiate between te doen (to do) and te maken (to make), and Turkish between kunnen (can), weten (to know) and kennen (to know) in Dutch (Coenen et al., 1979).",
        "Adopting terminology from Golding and Roth (1999) and Rozovskaya and Roth (2010), do/make and kunnen/kennen/weten form two confusion sets.",
        "However, unlike the case of kunnen/kennen/weten, where the correct choice is often determined by syntactic context 1, the choice between to make and to do can be motivated by semantic factors.",
        "It has been argued in the literature that the correct use of these verbs depends on what is being expressed: to do is used to refer to daily routines and activities, while to make is used to describe constructing or creating something.",
        "Since word choice errors have different nature, we hypothesize that there may exist no uniform approach to correct them.",
        "State-of-the-art spell-checkers are able to detect spelling and agreement errors but fail to find words used incorrectly, e.g. to distinguish to make from to do.",
        "Motivated by the implications that the correct prediction of two verbs of interest may have for automatic error correction, we model the problem of choosing the correct verb in a similar vein to selectional preferences.",
        "The latter has been considered for a variety of applications, e. g. semantic role la-beling (Zapirain et al., 2009).",
        "Words such as be or do have been often excluded from consideration because they are highly polysemous and ?do not select strongly for their arguments?",
        "(McCarthy and Carroll, 2003).",
        "In this paper, we study whether semantic classes of arguments may be used to determine the correct predicate (e.g., to make or to do) and consider the following research questions:",

        "How do approaches using contextual and syntactic information compare when predicting to make vs. to do?",
        "The paper is organised as follows.",
        "Section 2.1 discusses the methods, followed by Section 2.2 on data.",

        "For each verb in question, we have a frequency-based ranking list of nouns co-occurring with it (verb-object pairs) which we use for the first two methods.",

        "(1999) have proposed a soft-clustering method to determine selectional preferences, which models the joint distribution of nouns n and verbs v by conditioning them on a hidden class c. The probability of a pair (v, n) then equals",
        "Similarity-based method The next classifier we use combines similarity between nouns with ranking information and is a modification of the method described in (Padó et al., 2007).",
        "First, for all words ni on the ranking list their frequency scores are normalised between 0 and 1, fi.",
        "Then, they are weighed by the similarity score between a new noun nj and a corresponding word on the ranking list, ni, and the noun with the highest score (1-nearest neighbour) is selected: argmax ni fi ?",
        "sim(nj , ni) (2) Finally, two highest scores for each verb's ranking list are compared and the verb with higher score is selected as a preferred one.",
        "In addition, if we sum over all seen words instead of choosing the nearest neighbour, this will lead to the original approach by Padó et al. (2007).",
        "In the experimental part we consider both approaches (the original method is referred to as SMP while the nearest neighbour approach is marked by SMknn) and study whether there is any difference between the two when a verb that allows many different arguments is considered (e.g., it may be better to use the nearest neighbour approach for to do rather than aggregating over all similarity scores).",
        "Bag-of-words (BoW) approach This widely used approach to document classification considers contextual words and their frequencies to represent documents (Zellig, 1954).",
        "We restrict the length of the context around two verbs (within a window of ?2 and ?3 around the focus word, make or do) and build a Naive Bayes classifier."

        "all sentences with to do or to make (based on lem-mata).",
        "The verb to make occurs in 2,13% of sentences, and the verb to do in 3,27% of sentences in the PukWAC corpus.",

        "Unlike in English data, to make occurs here more often than to do (3,3% vs. 1%).",
        "This difference can be explained by the fact that to do is also an auxiliary verb in English which leads to more occurrences in total.",

        "Coverage is especially indicative for LCS and semantic similarity approaches because they may fail to yield predictions.",
        "For these methods, we provide two evaluations.",
        "First, in order to be able to compare results against the BoW approach, we measure accuracy and coverage on all test examples.",
        "In such a case, if some direct objects occur very often in the test set and are classified correctly, accuracy scores will be boosted.",
        "Therefore, we also provide the second evaluation where we measure accuracy and coverage on (unique) test examples regardless of how frequent they are.",
        "This evaluation will give us a better insight into how well LCS and similarity-based methods work.",
        "Finally, we tested several settings for the LSC method and the results presented here are obtained for 20 clusters and 50 iterations.",
        "We remove stop words 2 but do not take any other preprocessing steps.",
        "For both languages, it is more difficult to predict to do than to make, although the differences in performance on Dutch data (NL) are much smaller than on English data (EN (sm)).",
        "An interesting observation is that using second-order similarity slightly boosts performance for to make but is highly undesirable for predicting to do (decrease in accuracy for around 15%) in Dutch.",
        "This may be explained by the fact that the objects of to do are already very generic.",
        "Our findings on English data are that the similarity-based approach is more sensitive to the choice of aggregating over all words in the training set or selecting the nearest neighbour.",
        "In particular, we obtained better performance when choosing the nearest neighbour for to do but aggregating over all scores for to make.",
        "The results on Dutch and English data are in general not always comparable.",
        "In addition to the differences in performance of similarity-based methods, the BoW models work better for predicting to do in English but to make in Dutch.",
        "As expected, similarity-based approaches yield higher coverage than LSC, although the latter is superior in terms of accuracy (in all cases but to do in English).",
        "Since LSC turned out to be the most computationally efficient method, we have also run it on larger subsets of the PukWAC data set, up to the entire corpus.",
        "We have not noticed any signifi",
