        "However, finding a compelling account of semantic compositionality that utilises such representations has proven more difficult and is an active research topic (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008; Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011).",
        "It is in this area that our paper makes its contribution.",
        "The dominant approaches to distributional semantics have relied on relatively simple frequency counting techniques.",
        "However, such approaches fail to generalise to the much sparser distributions encountered when modeling compositional processes and provide no account of selectional preference.",
        "We propose a probabilistic model of the semantic representations for nouns and modifiers.",
        "The foundation of this model is a latent variable representation of noun and adjective semantics together with their compositional probabilities.",
        "We employ this formulation to give a dual view of noun-modifier semantics: the induced latent variables provide an explicit account of selectional preference while the marginal distributions of the latent variables for each word implicitly produce a distributed representation.",
