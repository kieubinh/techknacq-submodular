        "Table 4 summarizes the findings of the previous section for some of the most common verbs that appear in phrasal implicative constructions and the semantic types of nouns they collocate with.",
        "This table lists the implicative signatures of over three hundred phrasal implicative verb-noun collocations.",
        "On the level of surface strings the number of constructions is of course much larger because of different tenses for the verb and the many ways of fleshing a noun into a noun phrase.",
        "For example, the verb waste expands to wasted, has wasted, did not waste, etc.",
        "The noun chance expands to a chanche, the chance, his chance, her last chance, etc.",
        "The verb-noun collocations are publicly available.7 It is a much larger class than the simple implicatives discussed in Section 2 but it is not complete.",
        "From a linguistic point of view finding all the specimens is not important if the conceptual classification is done correctly.",
        "For computational applications completeness does matter.",
        "We plan to continue to expand the list in the near future.",
        "The noun and verb classes discussed in Section 3 contain items that are not together in any WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) SYNSET class.",
        "For example, acquit, fulfill, meet, and perform are interchangeable in sentences such as",
        "(37) a.",
        "He conscientiously acquitted his duty to inform and educate the Court.",
        "b.",
        "He fulfilled his duty to cremate his dead brother's body.",
        "c. The officer met his duty to investigate and had probable cause to arrest Kim.",
        "As far as WordNet is concerned, the verbs acquit, fulfill, meet, and perform are totally unrelated.",
        "Nevertheless they constitute an equivalence class for this particular phrasal implicative collocation, the MEET OBLIGATION to X construction.",
        "The same holds for the noun classes in Section 3.",
        "The class in 3.5 includes chutzpah and foresight.",
        "Substituting foresight for chutzpah in (33a) would retain the entailment, that Julie asked the meter maid for a quarter, but it would bring in a different presupposition.",
        "Some computational systems already take advantage of the semantic classification of simple and phrasal implicatives.",
        "PARC's Bridge system (Nairn et al., 2006) implements the simple implicatives discussed in Section 2.",
        "A few of the phrasal implicatives discussed in Section 3 have also been implemented in Bridge (Pichotta, 2008).",
        "The NatLog system (MacCartney, 2009) implements the same simple implicatives as Bridge but in a different way.",

        "NatLog takes (1b), Kim forgot to reschedule the meeting, as a paraphrase of what it entails, Kim did not reschedule the meeting, Bridge doesn't.",
        "But neither system recognizes the presupposition of intent that comes with the construction forget to X.",
        "One area that remains to be systematically explored is the complements of adjectives.",
        "It is known that there are factive adjectives such as strange, as in It is strange that Federer has never suffered a major injury, and two-way implicative adjectives such as lucky, as in He was lucky to break even, and phrasal adjective ++ |??",
        "constructions such as see (it) fit to X, as in He saw fit to laugh and sneer at us.",
