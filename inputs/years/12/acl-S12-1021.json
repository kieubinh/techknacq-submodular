        "The challenge posed by MWEs is threefold, consisting of MWE identification, classification and interpretation.",
        "Following the identification of a MWE, it needs to be established whether the expression should be treated as lexical (idiomatic) or as compositional.",

        "We develop a fine-grained representation of compositionality using a novel generative approach that models context as generated by compound constituents.",

        "(Spa?rck Jones, 1985), and are thus able to proliferate infinitely.",
        "At the same time, semantic composition can take many different forms, making uniform interpretation of compounds impossible (Zanzotto et al., 2010).",
        "Most current work on MWEs focuses on interpreting compounds and sidesteps the task of determining whether a compound is compositional in the first place (Butnariu et al., 2010; Kim and Baldwin, 2008).",
        "Such methods, aimed at learning the semantics of compounds, can roughly be divided into two major strands of research.",
        "One group relies on data intensive methods to extract semantics vectors from large corpora (Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Zanzotto et al., 2010; Gies-brecht, 2009).",
        "The focus of these approaches is to develop methods for composing the vectors of un-igrams into a semantic vector representing a compound.",
        "Some of the work in this area touches on the issue of lexicality, as models learning distributional representations of MWEs ideally would first establish whether a given MWE is compositional or not (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010).",
        "The other group are knowledge intensive approaches collecting linguistic features (Kim and Baldwin, 2005; Korkontzelos and Manandhar, 2009).",
        "Tratz and Hovy (2010), for instance, train a classifier for noun compound interpretation on a large set of WORDNET and Thesaurus features.",
        "Combined approaches include Kim and Baldwin (2008), who interpret noun compounds by extrapolating their semantics from observations where the two nouns forming a compound are in an intransitive relationship.",
        "For example extracting the phrase ?the family owns a car?",
        "from the training data would help learn that the compound ?family car?",
        "describes a POSSESSOR-OWNED/POSSESSED relationship.",
        "Some of these supervised classifiers include lexicality as a classification option, considering it jointly with the actual compound interpretation.",
        "Next to the work on MWE interpretation there has been some work focused on determining lexicality in its own right (Reddy et al., 2011; Bu et al., 2010; Kim and Baldwin, 2007).",
        "One possibility is to exploit special properties of lexical MWEs such as high statistical association of their constituents (Pedersen, 2011) or syntactic rigidity (Fazly et al., 2009; McCarthy et al., 2007).",
        "However, these approaches are limited in their applicability to compound nouns (Reddy et al., 2011).",
        "Another method is to compare the semantics of a compound and its constituents to decide compositionality.",
        "The approaches used to determine those semantics can again be divided into knowledge intensive and data-driven methods.",
        "Depending on the chosen representation of semantics these approaches can either be used for supervised classifiers or together with a distance metric comparing vector space representations of semantics.",
        "In a binary setting, a threshold would then be applied to the result of that distance function (Korkontzelos and Manandhar, 2009).",
        "In a real-valued setting the distance metric itself can be used as a measure for compositionality (Reddy et al., 2011).",

        "The two interpolation methods that we implemented helped us to strongly improve overall model performance.",
        "Our empirical evaluation of interpolation metricsClex(c) and Ilex(c) also gives credence to the hypothesis that lexicality is related to semantic similarity.",
        "On the theoretical side, we offered further support to the real-valued treatment of lexicality.",
        "Further work will include using larger training corpora.",
        "While the BNC is a popular corpus in Computational Linguistics, it proved to be too small to learn sensible representations for a number of compounds encountered in the test data.",
        "Using larger corpora will also allow us to further study and reduce the sparsity issues encountered.",
        "To study the relationship between constituent and compound compositionality in greater depth, we will also investigate alternative approaches for interpolation.",
        "Similarity measures that consider the semantic relevance of individual context elements should also be considered as a next step.",
        "Another obvious source of future work is to apply our approach to general collocations beyond the special case of noun compounds only."
