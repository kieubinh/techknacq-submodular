        "Scope ambiguity is a major source of ambiguity in semantic representation.",
        "For example, the sentence 1. Every politician has a website.",
        "has at least two possible interpretations, one in which each politician may have a different website (i.e., Every has wide scope) and one in which there is a unique website for all the politicians (i.e., Every has narrow scope).",
        "Since finding the most preferred reading automatically is very hard, the most widely adopted solution is to use an Underspecified Representation (UR), that is to encode the ambiguity in the semantic representation and leave scoping underspecified.",
        "In an early effort, Woods (1986) developed an un-scoped logical form where the above sentence is represented (roughly) as the formula: 2.",
        "Has(?Every x Politician?, ?A y Website?)",
        "To obtain a fully scoped formula, the quantifiers are pulled out one by one and wrapped around the formula.",
        "If we pull out Every first, we produce the fully-scoped formula: 3.",
        "A(y,Website(y), Every(x, Politician(x), Has(x, y))",
        "If we had pulled out A first, we would have had the other reading, with Every having wide scope.",
        "Hobbs and Shieber (1987) extend this formalism to support operators (such as not) and present an enumeration algorithm that is more efficient than the naive wrapping approach.",
        "Since the introduction of Quasi Logical Form (Al-shawi and Crouch, 1992), there has been a lot of work on designing constraint-based underspecification formalisms where the readings of a UR are not defined in a constructive fashion as shown above, but rather by a set of constraints.",
        "A fully-scoped structure is a reading iff it satisfies all the constraints.",
        "The advantage of these frameworks is that as the processing goes deeper, new (say pragmatically-driven) constraints can be added to the representation in order to filter out unwanted readings.",
        "Hole Semantics (Bos, 1996; Bos, 2002), Constraint Language for Lambda Structures (CLLS) (Egg et al., 2001), and Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) (Copes-take et al., 2001) are among these frameworks.",
        "In an effort to bridge the gap between the above formalisms, a graph theoretic model of scope underspecification was defined by Bodirsky et al. (2004), called Weakly Normal Dominance Graphs.",
        "This",
        "framework and its ancestor, Dominance Constraints (Althaus et al., 2003), are broad frameworks for solving constrained tree structures in general.",
        "When it comes to scope underspecification, some of the terminology becomes counter-intuitive.",
        "Therefore, here we first define (scope) Underspecification Graphs (UG), a notational variant of weakly normal dominance graphs, solely defined to model scope underspecification.1 Figure 1 shows a UG for the following sentence.",
        "4.",
        "Every child of a politician runs.",
        "The big circles and the dot nodes are usually referred to as the hole nodes (or simply holes) and the label nodes (or simply labels) respectively.",
        "The left and the right holes of each quantifier are placehold-ers for the restriction and the body of the quantifier.",
        "A fully scoped structure is built by plugging labels into holes, as shown in Figure 2(a).",
        "The dotted edges represent the constraints.",
        "For example, the constraint from the restriction hole of Every(x) to the node Politician(x) states that this label node must be within the scope of the restriction of Ev-ery(x) in every reading of the sentence.",
        "The constraint edge from Every(x) to Run(x) forces the binding constraint for variable x; that is variable x in Run(x) must be within the scope of its quantifier.",
        "Figure 2(b) represents the other possible reading of the sentence.",
        "Now consider the sentence: 5.",
        "Every politician, whom I know a child of, probably runs.",
        "with its UG shown in Figure 3.",
        "This sentence contains a scopal adverbial (a.k.a.",
        "fixed-scopal; cf. Copestake et al. (2005)), the word Probably.",
        "Since in general, quantifiers can move inside or outside a",
        "scopal operator, the scope of Probably is left underspecified, and hence represented by a hole.",
        "It is easy to verify that the corresponding UG has five possible readings, two of which are shown in Figure 4.",
        "There are at least two major algorithmic problems that need to be solved for any given UG U : the satisfiability problem; that is whether there exists any reading satisfying all the constraints in U , and the enumeration problem; that is enumerating all the possible readings of a satisfiable U .",
        "Unfortunately, both problems are NP-complete for UG in its general form (Althaus et al., 2003).",
        "This proves that Hole Semantics and Minimal Recursion Semantics are also intractable in their general form (Thater, 2007).",
        "In the last decade, there has been a series of interesting work on finding a tractable subset of those frameworks, broad enough to cover most structures occurring in practice.",
        "Those efforts resulted in two closely related tractable frameworks: (dominance) net and weak (dominance) net.",
        "Intuitively, the net condition requires the following property.",
        "Given a UG U , for every label node in U with n holes, if the node together with all its holes is removed from U , the remaining part is composed of at most n (weakly) connected components.",
        "A difference between net and weak net is that in nets, label",
        "to-label constraints (e.g. the constraint between Ev-ery(x) and Run(x) in Figure 1) are not allowed.",
        "Using a sample grammar for CLLS, Koller et al. (2003) conjecture that the syntax/semantics interface of CLLS only generates underspecified representations that follow the definition of net and hence can be solved in polynomial time.",
        "They also prove that the same efficient algorithms can be used to solve the underspecification structures of Hole Semantics which satisfy the net condition.",
        "Unlike Hole Semantics and CLLS, MRS implicitly carries label-to-label constraints; hence the concept of net could not be applied to MRS.",
        "In order to address this, Niehren and Thater (2003) define the notion of weak net and conjecture that it covers all semantically complete MRS structures occurring in practice.",
        "Fuchss et al. (2004) supported the claim by investigating MRS structures in the Redwoods corpus (Oepen et al., 2002).",
        "Later coherent sentences were found in other corpora or suggested by other researchers (see Section 6.2.2 in Thater (2007)), whose UR violates the net condition, invalidating the conjecture.",
        "However, violating the net condition occurs in a similar way in those examples, suggesting a family of non-net structures, characterized in Section 4.2.",
        "Since then, it has been an open question whether there exists a tractable superset of weak nets, covering this family of non-net UGs.",
        "In the rest of this paper, we answer this question.",
        "We modify the definition of weak net to define a superset of it, which we call super net.",
        "Super net covers the above mentioned family of non-net structures, yet is solvable by (almost) the same algorithms as those solving weak nets with the same time and space complexity.",
        "The structure of the paper is as follows.",
        "We define our framework in Section 2 and present the polynomial-time algorithms for its satisfiability and enumeration problems in Section 3.",
        "In Section 4, we compare our framework with nets and weak nets.",
