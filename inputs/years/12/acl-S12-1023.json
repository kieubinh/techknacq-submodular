        "Polysemy is pervasive in human language and is a problem in almost all applications of NLP, ranging from Machine Translation (as word senses can translate differently) to Textual Entailment (as most lexical entailments are sense-specific).",
        "The field has thus devoted a large amount of effort to the representation and modeling of word senses.",
        "The arguably most prominent effort is Word Sense Disambiguation, WSD (Navigli, 2009), an in-vitro task whose goal is to identify which, of a set of predefined senses, is the one used in a given context.",
        "In work on WSD and other tasks related to polysemy, such as word sense induction, sense alternations are treated as word-specific.",
        "As a result, a model for the meaning of lamb that accounts for the relation between the animal and food senses cannot predict that the same relation holds between instances of chicken or salmon in the same type of contexts.",
        "A large number of studies in linguistics and cognitive science show evidence that there are regularities in the way words vary in their meaning (Apresjan, 1974; Lakoff and Johnson, 1980; Copestake and Briscoe, 1995; Pustejovsky, 1995; Gentner et al., 2001; Murphy, 2002), due to general analogical processes such as regular polysemy, metonymy and metaphor.",
        "Most work in theoretical linguistics has focused on regular, systematic, or logical polysemy, which accounts for alternations like ANIMAL-FOOD.",
        "Sense alternations also arise from metaphorical use of words, as dark in dark glass-dark mood, and also from metonymy when, for instance, using the name of a place for a representative (as in Germany signed the treatise).",
        "Disregarding this evidence is empirically inadequate and leads to the well-known lexical bottleneck of current word sense models, which have serious problems in achieving high coverage (Navigli, 2009).",
        "We believe that empirical computational semantics could profit from a model of polysemy1 which (a) is applicable across individual words, and thus capable of capturing general patterns and generalizing to new 1Our work is mostly inspired in research on regular polysemy.",

        "Other improvements on the model and evaluation will be to develop more informed baselines that capture semantic shifts, as well as to test alternate weighting schemes for the co-occurrence vectors (e.g. PMI) and to use larger corpora than the BNC.",
        "The second step is to go beyond the limited in-vitro evaluation we have presented here by integrating alternation prediction into larger NLP tasks.",
        "Knowledge about alternations can play an important role in counteracting sparseness in many tasks that involve semantic compatibility, e.g., testing the applicability of lexical inference rules (Szpektor et al., 2008)."
