        "Semantic representation of text has received considerable attention these past years.",
        "While early shallow approaches have been proven useful for several natural language processing applications (Wu and Fung, 2009; Surdeanu et al., 2003; Shen and La-pata, 2007), the field is moving towards analyzing and processing complex linguistic phenomena, such as metaphor (Shutova, 2010) or modality and negation (Morante and Sporleder, 2012).",
        "The *SEM 2012 Shared Task is devoted to negation, specifically, to resolving its scope and focus.",
        "Negation is a grammatical category that comprises devices used to reverse the truth value of propositions.",
        "Broadly speaking, scope is the part of the meaning that is negated and focus the part of the scope that is most prominently or explicitly negated (Huddleston and Pullum, 2002).",
        "Although negation is a very relevant and complex semantic aspect of language, current proposals to annotate meaning either dismiss negation or only treat it in a partial manner.",
        "The interest in automatically processing negation originated in the medical domain (Chapman et al., 2001), since clinical reports and discharge summaries must be reliably interpreted and indexed.",
        "The annotation of negation and hedge cues and their scope in the BioScope corpus (Vincze et al., 2008) represented a pioneering effort.",
        "This corpus boosted research on scope resolution, especially since it was used in the CoNLL 2010 Shared Task (CoNLL ST 2010) on hedge detection (Farkas et al., 2010).",
        "Negation has also been studied in sentiment analysis (Wiegand et al., 2010) as a means to determine the polarity of sentiments and opinions.",
        "Whereas several scope detectors have been developed using BioScope (Morante and Daelemans, 2009; Velldal et al., 2012), there is a lack of corpora and tools to process negation in general domain texts.",
        "This is why we have prepared new corpora for scope and focus detection.",
        "Scope is annotated in Conan Doyle stories (CD-SCO corpus).",
        "For each negation, the cue, its scope and the negated event, if any, are marked as shown in example (1a).",
        "Focus is annotated on top of PropBank, which uses the WSJ section of the Penn TreeBank (PB-FOC corpus).",
        "Focus annotation is restricted to verbal negations annotated with MNEG in PropBank, and all the words belonging to a semantic role are selected as focus.",

        "These three scenarios also trigger a false negative (FN).",
        "Finally, FN also occur when the gold annotations specify a scope but the system makes no such prediction (Farkas et al., 2010).",
        "As we see it, the CONLL 2010 ST evaluation requirements were somewhat strict because for a scope to be counted as TP, the negation cue had to be correctly identified (strict match) as well as the punctuation tokens within the scope.",

        "These DRGs allow for cue detection by means of labelled tuples.",
        "Scope detection is done by gathering the tokens that occur within the scope of the negated DRSs.",
        "For negated event detection, a basic algorithm takes the detected scope and returns the negated event based on information from the syntax tree within the scope.",
        "UCM-1 and UCM-2 are rule-based systems that rely heavily on information from the syntax tree.",
        "The UCM-1 system was initially designed for pro",
        "candc/wiki/boxer cessing opinionated texts.",
        "It applies a dictionary approach to cue detection, with the detection of affixal cues being performed using WordNet.",
        "Non-affixal cue detection is performed by consulting a predefined list of cues.",
        "It then uses information from the syntax tree in order to get a first approximation to the scope, which is later refined using a set of post-processing rules.",
        "In the case of the UCM-2 system an algorithm detects negation cues and their scope by traversing Minipar dependency structures.",
        "Finally, the scope is refined with post-processing rules that take into account the information provided by the first algorithm and linguistic clause boundaries.",
        "If we compare tracks, the Global best results obtained in the closed track (57.63 F1) are higher than the Global best results obtained in the open track (54.82 F1).",
        "If we compare approaches, the best results in the two tracks are obtained with machine learning-based systems.",
        "The rule-based systems participating in the open track clearly score lower (39.56 F1 the best) than the machine learning-based system (54.82 F1).",
        "Regarding subtasks, systems achieve higher results in the cue detection task (92.34 F1 the best) and lower results in the scope resolution (72.40 F1 the best) and negated event detection (67.02 F1 the best) tasks.",
        "This is not surprising, not only because of the error propagation effect, but also because the set of negation cues is closed and comprises mostly single tokens, whereas scope sequences are longer.",
        "The best results in cue detection are obtained by the FBK system that uses CRFs and applies a special procedure to detect the negation cues that are subtokens.",
        "The best scores for scope resolution (72.40, 72.39 F1) are obtained by two machine learning components.",
        "UWashington uses CRFs with features derived from the syntax tree.",
        "UiO2 uses CRFs models with syntactic and lexical features for scopes, together with a set of labels aimed at capturing the behavior of certain tokens within the mechanics of negation.",
        "The best scores for negated events (67.02 F1) are obtained by the UiO1 system that first classifies negations as factual or non-factual, and then applies an SVM ranker over candidate events.",
        "Finally, we would like to draw the attention to the different scores obtained depending on the evaluation measure used.",
        "When scope resolution is evaluated with the Scope (NCM, CM) measure, results",
        "are much lower than when using the Scope Tokens measure, which does not reflect the ability of systems to deal with sequences.",
        "Another observation is related to the difference in precision scores between the two versions of the evaluation measures.",
        "Whereas for Cues and Negated the differences are not so big because most cues and negated events span over a single token, for Scopes they are.",
        "The best Scope NCM precision score is 90.00 %, whereas the best Scope NCM B precision score is 59.54 %.",
        "This shows that the scores can change considerably depending on how partial matches are counted (as FP and FN, or only as FN).",
        "As a final remark it is worth noting that the ranking of systems does not change when using the B measures."

        "A total of 14 runs were submitted, 12 for scope detection and 2 for focus detection.",
        "Of these, four runs are from systems that take a rule-based approach, two runs from hybrid systems, and the rest from systems that take a machine learning approach using SVMs or CRFs.",
        "Most participants designed a three component architecture.",
        "For a future edition of the shared task we would like to unify the annotation schemes of the two corpora, namely the annotation of focus in PB-FOC and negated events in CD-SCO.",
        "The annotation of more data with both scope and focus would allow us to study the two aspects jointly.",
        "We would also like to provide better evaluation measures for scope resolution.",
        "Currently, scopes are evaluated in terms of F1, which demands a division of errors into the categories TP/FP/TN/FN borrowed from the evaluation of information retrieval systems.",
        "These categories are not completely appropriate to be assigned to sequence tasks, such as scope resolution."
