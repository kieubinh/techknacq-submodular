        "Relational similarity measures the degree of correspondence between two relations, where instance pairs that have high relational similarity are said to be analogous, i.e., to express the same relation (Turney, 2006).",
        "However, a class of analogous relations may still have significant variability in the degree of relational similarity of its members.",
        "Consider the four word pairs dog:bark, cat:meow, floor:squeak, and car:honk.",
        "We could say that these four X:Y pairs are all instances of the semantic relation EN-TITY:SOUND; that is, X is an entity that characteristically makes the sound Y .",
        "Within a class of analogous pairs, certain pairs are more characteristic of the relation.",
        "For example, many would agree that dog:bark and cat:meow are better prototypes of the ENTITY:SOUND relation than floor:squeak.",
        "Our task requires automatic systems to quantify the degree of prototypicality of a target pair by measuring the relational similarity between it and pairs that are given as defining examples of a particular relation.",
        "So far, most work in semantic relations has focused on differences between relation categories for classifying new relation instances.",
        "Past SemEval tasks that use relations have focused largely on discrete classification (Girju et al., 2007; Hendrickx et al., 2010) and paraphrasing the relations connecting noun compounds with a verb (Butnariu et al., 2010), which is also a form of discrete classification due to the lack of continuous degrees.",
        "However, there is some loss of information in any discrete classification of semantic relations.",
        "Furthermore, while some discrete classifiers provide a degree of confidence or probability for a relation classification, there is no a priori reason that such values would correspond to human prototypicality judgments.",
        "Our proposed task is distinct from these past tasks in that we focus on measuring the degree of relational similarity.1 A graded measure of the degree of relational similarity would tell us that dog:bark is more similar to cat:meow than to floor:squeak.",
        "The discrete classification ENTITY:SOUND drops this information.",
        "Systems that are successful at identifying degrees of relation similarity can have a significant impact where an application must choose between multiple instances of the same relation.",
        "We illustrate this with two examples.",
        "First, consider a relational search task (Cafarella et al., 2006).",
        "A user of a relational search engine might give the query,",
        "?List all things that are part of a car.?",
        "SemEval2007 Task 4 proposed that a relational search engine would use semantic relation classification to answer queries like this one.",
        "For this query, a classifier that was trained with the relation PART:WHOLE would be used.",
        "However, a system for measuring degrees of relational similarity would be better suited to relational search than a discrete classifier, because the relational search engine could then rank the output list in order of applicability.",
        "For the same query, the search engine could rank each item X in descending order of the degree of relational similarity between X:car and a training set of prototypical examples of the relation PART:WHOLE.",
        "This would be analogous to how standard search engines rank documents or web pages in descending order of relevance to the user's query.",
        "As a second example, consider the role of relational similarity in analogical transfer.",
        "When faced with a new situation, we look for an analogous situation in our past experience, and we use analogical inference to transfer information from the past experience (the source domain) to the new situation (the target domain) (Gentner, 1983; Holyoak, 2012).",
        "Analogy is based on relational similarity (Gentner, 1983; Turney, 2008).",
        "The degree of relational similarity in an analogy is indicative of the likelihood that transferred knowledge will be applicable in the target domain.",
        "For example, past experience tells us that a dog barks to send a signal to other creatures.",
        "If we transfer this knowledge to a new experience with a cat meowing, we can predict that the cat is sending a signal, and we can act appropriately with that prediction.",
        "If we transfer this knowledge to a new experience with a floor squeaking, we might predict that the floor is sending a signal, which might lead us to act inappropriately.",
        "If we have a choice among several source analogies, usually the source pair with the highest degree of relational similarity to the target pair will prove to be the most useful analogy in the target domain, providing practical benefits beyond discrete relational classification."

        "Given a pair such as repair:break, we compare this pair to the paradigmatic examples and/or the schematic representation, in order to estimate its degree of prototypicality.",
        "The challenges are (1) to infer the relation from the paradigmatic examples and identify what relational or featural attributes best characterize that relation, and (2) to identify the relation of the given pair and rate how similar it is to that shared by the paradigmatic examples."

      "text": [
        "Researchers in psychology and linguistics have considered many different categorizations of semantic relations.",
        "The particular relation categorization is often driven by both the type of data and the intended application.",
        "Nastase and Szpakowicz (2003) propose a two-level hierarchy for noun-modifier relations, which has been widely used (Nakov and Hearst, 2008; Nastase et al., 2006; Turney and Littman, 2005; Turney, 2005).",
        "Others have used classifications based on the requirements for a specific task, such as Information Extraction (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006) or biomedical applications (Stephens et al., 2001).",
        "We adopt the relation classification scheme of Be-jar et al. (1991), which includes ten high-level categories (e.g., CAUSE-PURPOSE and SPACE-TIME).",
        "Each category has between five and ten more refined subcategories (e.g., CAUSE-PURPOSE includes CAUSE:EFFECT and ACTION:GOAL), for a total of 79 distinct subcategories.",
        "Although these categories do not reflect all possible semantic relations, they greatly expand the coverage of relation types from those used in past relation-based SemEval tasks (Girju et al., 2007; Hendrickx et al., 2010), which used only seven and nine relation types, respectively.",
        "Furthermore, the classification includes many of the fundamental relations, e.g., TAXONOMIC and PART:WHOLE, while also including relations between a variety of parts of speech and less common relations, such as REFERENCE (e.g., SIGN:SIGNIFICANT) and NONATTRIBUTE (e.g., AGENT:ATYPICAL ACTION).",

        "In the second part of the Phase 1 questionnaire, Turkers were shown the three prototypes again and asked to generate four word pairs that expressed the same relation.",
        "Turkers were directed to be mindful of the order of the words in each pair, as reversed orderings can have very different degrees of prototypicality in the case of directional relations.",
        "The Turkers provided a total of 3160 additional examples for the 79 subcategories, 2905 of which were unique.",
        "We applied minor manual correction to remove spelling errors, which reduced the total number of examples to 2823.",
        "A median of 38 examples were found per subcategory with a maximum of 40 and minimum of 23.",

        "Two teams, BUAP and UTD, accounted for relation directionality, while Duluth did not, which resulted in the Duluth systems ranking reversed pairs the same.",
        "Therefore, we conducted a post-hoc analysis of the impact of reversals by removing the reversed pairs from the computed prototypicality rankings.",
        "Table 5 reports the resulting Spearman's ?.",
        "With Spearman's ?, we can easily evaluate the impact of the reversals, because we can delete a reversed pair without affecting anything else.",
        "For the MaxDiff questions, if there is one reversal in a group of four choices, then we need to delete the whole MaxDiff question.",
        "Therefore we do not include the MaxDiff score in Table 5.",
        "Removing reversals decreased performance in the three systems that were sensitive to pair ordering (BUAP, UTD-NB, and UTD-SVM), while only marginally increasing performance in the three systems that ignored the ordering.",
        "The performance decrease in systems that use ordering suggests that the reversed pairs are easily identified and ranked appropriately low.",
        "As a further estimate of the models?",
        "ability to correctly order reversals, we compared the difference in a reversal's rank for both a system?s",
        "tween a pair and its reversal in the gold standard.",
        "ranking and the ranking computed from Turker Responses.",
        "Table 6 reports the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) in ranking difference for the three systems that took argument order into account.",
        "Although not the best performing system, Table 6 indicates that the UTD-SVM system was most able to appropriately weight reversals?",
        "prototypicality.",
        "In contrast, the UTD-NB system often had many pairs tied for the lowest rank, which either resulted in pair and its reversal being tied or having a much smaller rank difference, thereby increasing its RMSE."

        "We have introduced a new task focused on rating the degrees of prototypicality for word pairs sharing the same relation.",
        "Participants first identify the relation shared between example pairs and then rate the degree to which each pair expresses that relation.",
        "As a part of the task, we constructed a dataset of prototypicality ratings for 3218 word pairs in 79 different relation categories.",
        "Participating systems used combinations of corpus-based, syntactic, and WordNet features, with varying degrees of success.",
        "The task also included a competitive baseline, PMI, which surpassed all but one system.",
        "Several models obtained moderate performance in select relation subcategories, but no one approach succeeded in general, which introduces much opportunity for future improvement.",
        "We also hope that both the example pairs and their prototypicality ratings will be a valuable data set for future research in Linguistics as well as Cognitive Psychology.",
        "All data sets for this task have been made publicly available on the task website."
