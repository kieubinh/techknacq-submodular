        "We model simplicity with a range of features divided into six groups.",
        "Five of these groups make use of the distributional hypothesis and rely on external corpora.",
        "We measure a candidate's distribution in terms of its lexical associations (RI), participation in syntactic structures (S??",
        "), or corpus presence in order to assess its simplicity (N???",
        "?, SW, C???).",
        "A single group, L?",
        "?, measures intrinsic aspects of the substitution candidate, such as its length.",
        "The substitution candidate is either an adjective, an adverb, a noun, or a verb, and all candidates within a list share the same part of speech.",
        "Because word class might influence simplicity, we allow our model to fit parameters specific to the candidate's part of speech by making a copy of the features for each part of speech which is active only when the candidate is in the given part of speech.",
        "Simple Wikipedia (SW) These two features contain relative frequency counts of the substitution form in Simple English Wikipedia (SWfreq), and the log likelihood ratio of finding the word in the simple corpus to finding it in regular Wikipedia (SWLLR)1.",
        "Word length (L??)",
        "This set of three features describes the length of the substitution form in characters (L?",
        "?sf ), the length of the longest token (L?",
        "?max), and the length of the substitution form in tokens (L??tokens).",
        "Word length is an integral part of common measures of text complexity, e.g in the English Flesch?Kincaid (Kincaid et al., 1975) in the form of syllable count, and in the Scandinavian LIX (Bjornsson, 1983).",
        "Character trigram model (C???)",
        "These three features approximate the reading difficulty of a word in terms of the probabilities of its forming character trigrams, with special characters to mark word beginning and end.",
        "A word with an unusual combination of characters takes longer to read and is perceived as less simple (Ehri, 2005).",
        "We calculate the minimum, average, and maximum trigram probability (C??",
        "?min, C??",
        "?avg, and C??",
        "?max).2 Web corpus N-gram (N????)",

        "N???",
        "?sf is the probability of substitution form itself, a feature which also is the backbone of our frequency baseline.",
        "Random Indexing (RI) These four features are obtained from measures taken from a word-to-word distributional semantic model.",
        "Random Indexing (RI) was chosen for efficiency reasons (Sahlgren, 2005).",
        "We include features describing the semantic distances between the candidate and the original",
        "form (RIorig), and between the candidate and a prototype vector (RIproto).",
        "For the distance between candidate and original, we hypothesize that annotators would prefer a synonym closer to the original form.",
        "A prototype distributional vector of a set of words is built by summing the individual word vectors, thus obtaining a representation that approximates the be-havior of that class overall (Turney and Pantel, 2010).",
        "Longer distances indicate that the currently examined substitution is far from the shared meaning of all the synonyms, making it a less likely candidate.",
        "The features are included for both lemma and surface forms of the words.",
        "Syntactic complexity (S??)",
        "These 23 features measure the syntactic complexity of documents where the substitution candidate occurs.",
        "We used measures from (Lu, 2010) in which they describe 14 automatic measures of syntactic complexity calculated from frequency counts of 9 types of syntactic structures.",
        "This group of syntax-metric scores builds on two ideas.",
        "First, syntactic complexity and word difficulty go together.",
        "A sentence with a complicated syntax is more likely to be made up of difficult words, and conversely, the probability that a word in a sentence is simple goes up when we know that the syntax of the sentence is uncomplicated.",
        "To model this we search for instances of the substitution candidates in the UKWAC corpus4 and measure the syntactic complexity of the documents where they occur.",

        "Consider the adjective ?frigid?, which may be judged to be simpler than ?gelid?",
        "if referring to temperature, but perhaps less simple than ?ice-cold?",
        "when characterizing someone's personality.",
