        "Cross-lingual textual entailment (CLTE) (Mehdad et al., 2010) is an extension of textual entailment (TE) (Dagan and Glickman, 2004).",
        "The task of recognizing entailment is to determine whether a hypothesis H can be semantically inferred from a text T .",
        "The CLTE task adds a cross-lingual dimension to the problem by considering sentence pairs, where T and H are in different languages.",
        "The SemEval-2012 CLTE task (Negri et al., 2012) asks participants to judge entailment pairs in four language combinations1, defining four target entailment relations, forward, backward, bidirectional and no entailment.",
        "We investigate this problem in a statistical learning framework, which allows us to combine cross-lingual word alignment features as well as common 1Spanish-English (es-en), Italian-English (it-en), French-English (fr-en) and German-English (de-en).",
        "monolingual entailment metrics, such as bag-of-words overlap, edit distance and monolingual alignments on translations of T and H , using standard statistical machine translation (SMT) tools and resources.",
        "Our goal is to address this task without deep processing components to make it easily portable across languages.",
        "We argue that the cross-lingual entailment task can benefit from direct alignments between T and H , since a large amount of bilingual parallel data is available, which naturally models synonymy and paraphrasing across languages."

        "With the yearly Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) challenge (Dagan et al., 2006), there has been a lot of work on monolingual TE.",
        "We therefore include established monolingual features in our approach, such as alignment scores (MacCartney et al., 2008), edit distance and bag-of-words lexical overlap measures (Kouylekov and Negri, 2010).",
        "So far, the only work on CLTE that we are aware of is Mehdad et al. (2010), where the problem is reduced to monolingual entailment using machine translation, and Mehdad et al. (2011), which exploits parallel corpora for generating features based on phrase alignments as input to an SVM.",
        "Our approach combines ideas from both, mostly resembling Mehdad et al. (2011).",
        "There are, however, several differences; we use word translation probabilities instead of phrase tables and model monolingual and cross-lingual alignment separately.",
        "We also include additional similarity measures derived from the MT evaluation metric Meteor, which was used in Volokh and Neumann (2011) for the monolingual TE task.",

        "versely, Pado?",
        "et al (2009) showed that textual entailment features can be used for measuring MT quality, indicating a strong relatedness of the two problems.",
        "The CLTE task is also related to the problem of identifying parallel sentence pairs in a non-parallel corpus, so we adapt alignment-based features from Munteanu and Marcu (2005), where a Maximum Entropy classifier was used to judge if two sentences are sufficiently parallel.",
        "Regarding the view on entailment, MacCartney and Manning (2007) proposed the decomposition of top-level entailment, such as equivalence (which corresponds to the CLTE bidirectional class), into atomic forward and backward entailment predictions, which is mirrored in our multi-label approach with two binary classifiers."
