        "Currently, there are many dependency parsers available, such as Eisner's probabilistic dependency parser (Eisner, 1996), McDonald's MSTParser (McDonald et al. 2005a; McDonald et al. 2005b) and Nivre's MaltParser (Nivre, 2006).",
        "Despite of elaborate models, lots of problems still exist in dependency parsing.",
        "For example, sentence length has been proved to show great impact on the parsing performance.",
        "(Li et al., 2010) used a two-stage approach based on sentence fragment for high-order graph-based dependency parsing.",
        "Lacking of linguistic knowledge is also blamed.",

        "Meanwhile, Chu-Liu-Edmond's algorithm (Chu and Liu, 1965) is applied for non-projective task, which takes O(n2) time.",
        "Three methods are adopted to MSTParser in our system: 1) Sentences are split into sub-sentences by commas and semicolons, for which there are two ways.",
        "Splitting sentences by all commas and semicolons is used in our primary system.",
        "In our contrast system, we use a classifier to determine whether a comma or semicolon can be used to split the sentence.",
        "In the primary and contrast system, the proto sentences and the sub-sentences are trained and tested separately and the outputs are merged in the end.",
        "2) In a Chinese word, the last character usually contains main sense or semantic class.",
        "We treat the last character of the word as word lemma and find it gets a slightly improvement in the experiment.",
        "3) An experiment trying to solve the problem of multilevel labels was conducted by parsing different levels separately and consequently merging the outputs together.",
