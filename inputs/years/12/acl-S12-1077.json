        "Our participations were two systems.",

        "The proposed rules enable the system to adequately handle domain knowledge gaps that are inherent when working with knowledge resources.",

        "Accurately establishing sentence semantic similarity would provide one of the key ingredients for solutions to many text-related applications, such as automatic grading systems (Mohler and Mihalcea, 2009), paraphrasing (Fernando and Stevenson, 2008), text entailment (Corley et al., 2005) and summarization (Erkan and Radev, 2004).",
        "Current approaches for computing semantic similarity between a pair of sentences focus on analyzing their shared words (Salton, 1989), structures (Hu et al. 2011;Mandreoli et al. 2002), semantics (Mihalcea et al. 2006; Le el al.",
        "2006; Hatzivassiloglou, 1999) or any of their combinations (Liu et al. 2008; Foltz et al. 1998).",
        "The goal is to arrive at a score which increases proportionally with the relatedness between the two sentences.",
        "Yet, they are not concerned with scoring the interpretations of such relatedness (Zhang et al. 2011; Jesus et al. 2011; Wenyin et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2008).",
        "Semantic Textual Similarity (STS), SEMEVAL12 Task 6 (Agirre et al. 2012), measures the degree of semantic equivalence between a pair of sentences by comparing meaningful contents within a sentence.",
        "The assigned scores range from 0 to 5 for each sentence pair with the following interpretations: (5) completely equivalent, (4) mostly equivalent pair with missing unimportant information, (3) roughly equivalent with missing important information, (2) not equivalent, but sharing some details, (1) not equivalent but sharing the same topic and (0) not equivalent and on different topics.",
        "The goal of developing our rule-based system was to identify knowledge representations which have possibly all task human interpretations.",
        "Meanwhile, the system domain-free rules aim to help the human annotator in scoring semantic equivalence of sentence pair.",
        "The proposed rule-based solution exploits both sentence syntax and semantics.",
        "First, it uses Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2002) to expose the sentence structure, part-of-speech (POS) word tags, parse tree and Subject-Verb-Object (S-V-O) dependencies.",
        "Second, Illinois Coreference Package (Bengtson and Roth, 2008) is used to extract sentence named entities resolving possible men",
        "tions.",
        "Third, WordNet (Miller, 1995) and Adapted Lesk Algorithm for word sense disambiguation (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2010) are used to compute each sentence word semantic relatedness to the other sentence.",
        "ReVerb (Etzioni et al. 2011) augments WordNet in case of uncovered words and helps us to discriminate the topics of sentences.",
        "We use (Blake, 2007) thought to compare the sentence pair words with each other.",
        "Finally, we evolve a rule-based module to present the human heuristics when he interprets the relatedness of the sentence pair meaningful contents.",
        "Throughout our training and testing experiments, we used Task6 corpora (Agirre et al. 2012) namely MSRpar, MSRvid, SMTeuroparl, OnWN and SMTnews; where: - MSRpar is 1500 pairs of sentences of MSR-Paraphrase, Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus; 750 for training and 750 for testing.",

        "- SMTnews is 399 pairs of sentences of news conversation sentence pairs from WMT; it is only a testing corpus.",
