        "For the last couple of years the research community has focused on a deeper analysis of natural languages, seeking to capture the meaning of the text in different contexts: in machine translation preserving the meaning of the translations is crucial to determine whether a translation is useful or not, in question-answering understanding the question leads to the desired answers (while the opposite case makes a system rather frustrating to the user) and the examples could continue.",
        "In this newly defined task, Semantic Textual Similarity, there is hope that efforts in different areas will be shared and united towards the goal of identifying meaning and recognizing equivalent, similar or unrelated texts.",

        "The system is based on a machine learning approach and it utilizes eight WordNet-based (Fellbaum, 1998) similarity measures, as explained in (Castillo, 2011), with the purpose of obtaining the maximum similarity between two WordNet concepts.",

        "Results reported in Table 1 show that we achieved the best performance with SVM with regression and Linear Regression classifiers and using MLP we obtained the worst results to predict each dataset.",
        "To our surprise, a linear regression classifier reports better accuracy that MLP, it may be mainly due to the correlation coefficient used, namely Pearson, which is a measure of a linear dependence between two variables and linear regression builds a model assuming linear influence of independent features.",
        "We believe that using Spearman correlation should be better than using the Pearson coefficient given that Spearman assumes non-linear correlation among variables.",
        "However, it is not clear how it behaves when several dataset are combined to obtain a global score.",
        "Indeed, further discussion is needed in order to find the best metric to the STS pilot task.",
        "Given these results, in our submission for the STS pilot task we used a combination of STS datasets as training set and the SVM with regression classifier.",
        "Because our approach is mainly based on machine learning the quality and quantity of dataset is a key factor to determine the performance of the system, thus we decided to experiment with RTE datasets too (Bentivogli et el., 2009) with the aim of increasing the size of the training set.",
        "To achieve this goal, first we chose the RTE3 dataset because it is simpler than subsequent datasets and it was proved to provide a high accuracy predicting other datasets (Castillo, 2011).",
        "Second, taking into account that RTE datasets are binary classified as YES or NO entailment, we assumed that a non entailment can be treated as a value of 2.0 in the STS pilot task and an entailment can be thought of as a value of 3.0 in STS.",
        "Of course, many pairs classified as 3.0 could be mostly equivalent (4.0) or completely equivalent (5.0) but we ignored this fact in the following experiment.",
        "From these experiments we conclude that RTE3 alone is not enough to adequately predict neither of the STS datasets, and it is understandable if we note that only one pair with 2.0 and 3.0 scores are present in this dataset.",
        "On the other hand, by combining RTE3 with a STS corpus we always obtain a slight decrease in performance in comparison to using STS alone.",
        "It is likely due to an unbalanced set and possible contradictory pairs (e.g: a par in RTE3 classified as 3.0 when it should be classified 4.3).",
        "Thus, we conclude that in order to use the RTE datasets our system needs a manual annotation of the degree of semantic similarity of every pair <T,H> of RTE dataset.",

        "This highlights the need for larger datasets for the purpose of building more accurate models.",
        "With ALLnrm our system achieved better results but since this metric is based on normalized Pearson correlation which assumes a linear correlation, we believe that this metric is not representative of the underlying phenomenon.",
