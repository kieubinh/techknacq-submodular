        "These models are based on the distributional hypothesis in linguistics that words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings.",
        "The similarities between these vectors indicate similarity in the meanings of corresponding words.",
        "The state of the art model in paraphrase detection uses an unsupervised recursive autoencoder (RAE) model based on an unfolding objective that learn feature vectors for phrases in syntactic parse trees (Socher et al., 2011).",
        "The idea of neural language models is to jointly learn an embedding of words into an n-dimensional vector space that capture distributional syntactic and semantic information via the words co-occurrence statistics.",
        "Further details and evaluations of these embeddings are discussed in Turian et al. (2010).",
        "Once the distributional syntactic and semantic matrix is learned on an unlabeled corpus, one can use it for subsequent tasks by using each words vector to represent that word.",

        "Interestingly, the opposite is true of eigenword similarity, where the best results are seen when they are independent of selectors or the neural models.",
        "The decreased correlations can be accounted for by the new features introducing over fitting, and one should note that no such reductions in performance are significant compared to the baseline, where as our best performance is a significant (p < 0.05) improvement.",

        "We did not tune our system differently for different data sets although there is evidence of specific features favoring certain data sets.",
        "In the case of the neural model of similarity we expect that deriving phrase level representations from the sentences and utilizing the dynamic pooling layer should give us a more thorough measure of similarity beyond the sentence-level vectors we used in this work.",

        "al, 2011).",
