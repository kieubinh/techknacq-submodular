        "uni-directional relations between monolingual pairs) transformed into their cross-lingual counterpart by translating the hypotheses into other languages (Negri and Mehdad, 2010), and ii) machine translation evaluation datasets (Mehdad et al., 2012b).",
        "The content synchronization task represents a challenging application scenario to test the capabilities of CLTE systems, by proposing a richer inventory of phenomena (i.e. ?Bidirectional?/?Forward?/?Backward?/?No entailment?",
        "multi-directional entailment relations).",
        "Multi-directional CLTE recognition can be seen as the identification of semantic equivalence and information disparity between two topically related sentences, at the cross-lingual level.",
        "This is a core aspect of the multilingual content synchronization task, which represents a challenging application scenario for a variety of NLP technologies, and a shared research framework for the integration of semantics and MT technology.",

        "(translation of the two input texts into the same language, as in (Mehdad et al., 2010)), or an ?integrated solution?",
        "that exploits bilingual phrase tables to capture lexical relations and contextual information (Mehdad et al., 2011).",
        "The promising results achieved with the integrated approach still rely on phrasal matching techniques that disregard relevant semantic aspects of the problem.",
        "By filling this gap integrating linguistically motivated features, in our participation, we propose an approach that combines lexical, syntactic and semantic features within a machine learning framework (Mehdad et al., 2012a).",
        "Our submitted runs have been produced by training and optimizing multiclass and binary SVM classifiers, over the Spanish-English (Spa-Eng) development set.",
        "In both cases, our results were positive, showing significant improvements over the median systems and average scores obtained by participants.",

        "Phrase Table (PT) matching: through",
        "these features, a semantic judgement about entailment is made exclusively on the basis of lexical evidence.",
        "The matching features are calculated with a phrase-to-phrase matching process.",
        "A phrase in our approach is an n-gram composed of one or more (up to 5) consecutive words, excluding punctuation.",
        "Entailment decisions are assigned combining phrasal matching scores calculated for each level of n-grams (i.e. considering the number of 1-grams, 2-grams,..., 5-grams extracted from H that match with n-grams in T).",
        "Phrasal matches, performed either at the level of tokens, lemmas, or stems, can be of two types:",
        "1.",
        "Exact: in the case that two phrases are identical at one of the three levels (token, lemma, stem).",
        "2.",
        "Lexical: in the case that two different phrases",
        "can be mapped through entries of the resources used to bridge T and H (i.e. phrase tables).",
        "For each phrase in H, we first search for exact matches at the level of token with phrases in T. If no match is found at a token level, the other levels (lemma and stem) are attempted.",
        "Then, in case of failure with exact matching, lexical matching is performed at the same three levels.",
        "To reduce redundant matches, the lexical matches between pairs of phrases which have already been identified as exact matches are not considered.",
        "Once the matching phase for each n-gram level has been concluded, the number of matches Matchn and the number of phrases in the hypothesis H(n) is used to estimate the portion of phrases in H that are matched at each level n (Equation 1).1 Since languages can express the same meaning with different amounts of words, a phrase with length n in H can match a phrase with any length in T.",
        "In order to build English-Spanish phrase tables for our experiments, we used the freely available Europarl V.4, News Commentary and United Nations Spanish-English parallel corpora released for the WMT10 Shared Translation Task.2 We run the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1995) and Snowball stemmer (Porter, 2001) for preprocessing, and used the Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2000) toolkit to align the tokenized corpora at the word level.",

        "Yahoo?",
        "is evident when syntax (in this case subject-object inversion) is taken into account, but can not be caught by bag-of-words methods.",
        "We define a dependency relation as a triple that connects pairs of words through a grammatical relation.",
        "For example, ?nsubj (loves, John)?",
        "is a dependency relation with head loves and dependent John connected by the relation nsubj, which means that ?John?",

        "terms (e.g. unseen person, location, or organization names) is an effective way to improve CLTE performance, even at the cost of some loss in precision.",
        "Semantic phrase tables, however, have two additional advantages.",
        "The first is related to their smaller size and, in turn, its positive impact on system's efficiency, due to the considerable search space reduction.",
        "Semantic tags allow to merge different sequences of tokens into a single tag and, consequently, different phrase entries can be unified to one semantic phrase entry.",
        "As a result, for instance, the SPT used in our experiments is more than 30% smaller than the original token-based one.",
        "The second advantage relates to their potential impact on the confidence of CLTE judgements.",
        "Since a semantic tag might cover more than one token in the original entry phrase, SPT entries are often short generalizations of longer original phrases.",
        "Consequently, the matching process can benefit from the increased probability of mapping higher order n-grams (i.e. those providing more contextual information) from H into T and vice-versa.",
        "Like lexical phrase tables, SPTs are extracted from parallel corpora.",
        "As a first step, we annotate the corpora with named-entity taggers (FreeLing in our case (Carreras et al., 2004)) for the source and target languages, replacing named entities with general semantic labels chosen from a coarse-grained taxonomy including the categories: person, location, organization, date and numeric expression.",
        "Then, we combine the sequences of unique labels into one single token of the same label, and we run Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2000) to align the resulting semantically augmented corpora.",
        "Finally, we extract the semantic phrase table from the augmented aligned corpora using the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "For the matching phase, we first annotate T and H in the same way we labeled our parallel corpora.",
        "Then, for each n-gram order (n=1 to 5, excluding punctuation), we use the SPT to calculate a matching score (SPT matchn, see Equation 3), as the number of n-grams in H that match with phrases in T divided by the number of n-grams in H. The matching algorithm is same as the phrase table matching one.",
        "In our supervised learning framework, the computed PT, SPT and DR scores are used as separate features, giving to an SVM classifier, LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011), the possibility to learn optimal feature weights from training data."
