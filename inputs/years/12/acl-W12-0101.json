        "Over the past decades, Machine Translation (MT) has undergone various changes with regard to the underlying technology.",
        "Starting in the middle of the last century with rule-based MT, a first logical step was taken towards the end of the century, when statistical methods in Natural Language Processing (NLP) gained overall importance, as the growing number of online available texts could be used as a basis for statistical computations performed on these texts and translations, which resulted in an enhancement of existing rules, statistics and thus results.",
        "The new field of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) was born and MT systems became increasingly better as more and more texts and translations were available.",
        "In parallel to the developments in MT, the Web has significantly grown and gained importance, especially in the recently defined field of the Semantic Web.",
        "After having accepted statistical methods as a promising change in MT, we believe that a next logical step will combine MT with Semantic Web technology, resulting in a new focus which can be called Semantic Web Machine Translation (SWMT).",
        "In this paper, we will develop our ideas step by step and will demonstrate on a sample sentence including a lexical ambiguity that our approach does not involve a costly disambiguation process on the basis of parsing online-dictionaries.",
        "Instead, we believe that modern Information Technology (IT) is aligned and committed to information and its markup, as the W3C Semantic Web technology stack1 demonstrates, and that we can use the contained knowledge in our disambiguation process without additional MT rules or statistics being applied."

        "More recent development in MT has started to use the vast amount of texts and knowledge that is",

        "(Boothroyd 2011) Therefore, with the change of available resources and the growing number of natural language that is available in machine-readable format as well as the growing number of users inputting corrections to machine translations manually, thus allowing a direct and correct match between source and target texts, we have entered this subfield of MT which focuses on a statistical analysis of texts, in which documents are translated according to a probability distribution p(e|f) which states that a string e in the target language is the translation of a string f in the source language.",
        "Philipp Koehn, being among the most popular SMT researchers and developers, also highlights today's quality of SMT and the relevance of the vast amounts of texts in the web, which provide the basis for SMT translations, by stating ?Now, armed with vast amounts of example translations and powerful computers, we can witness significant progress toward achieving that dream.?",
        "(Koehn et al. 2012) The research field of statistical machine translation is a rather new field.",
        "In his commented bibliography2 Koehn includes statistics about the distribution of publications in the SMT field across the years 1953 until 2008.",
        "It is clearly shown that only a few publications appeared before the millennium change and that SMT clearly became an issue of growing interest in the new millennium, with a peak in 2006.",
        "Scientists working in the MT field suddenly became aware of the relevance and potential provided by statistics in machine translation and computational linguistics in general.",
        "Still in 2003, Knight & Koehn stated, that ?the currently best performing statistical machine translation systems are still crawling at the bottom?, (Knight & Koehn 2004, p. 10), implying that most of the approaches hadn't gone beyond simple word to word translations yet and hadn't included more advanced stages of NLP, like syntax or even semantics.",
        "Among those who made essential contributions to the field of SMT was Kevin Knight who stated in 1999 that ?We want to automatically analyse existing human sentence translations, with an eye toward building general translation rules we will use these rules to translate new texts automatically.?",
        "(Knight 1999) The previous statements all point at the vast knowledge included in the just as vast amounts of texts available in digital form in the internet, partly in the form of human sentence translations.",
        "At the same time that MT started clearly moving into using the Web to search for machine-readable texts and translations that could be used in the expanding SMT field, Tim Berners-Lee (Berners-Lee & Hendler 2001) defined the knowledge, that is included in the Web content, to ex",

        "As mentioned earlier, we believe that modern IT follows the commitment of information and it's markup, and the Semantic Web technology stack is a perfect implementation of that paradigm.",
        "To demonstrate our approach, we selected a common and well known issue: The problem in many areas of NLP is the ambiguity of natural language on various levels, from word level to sentence level.",
        "In many cases, strings can only be disambiguated on the basis of world or expert knowledge.",
