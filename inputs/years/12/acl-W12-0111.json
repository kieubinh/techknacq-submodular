        "It is not surprising that lexical substitution achieves a significant increase in all metrics.",
        "The approach only translates untranslated words using the RBMT lexicon.",
        "This can improve the translation or, because of noisy matching elements, introduce wrong words but the penalty incurred for untranslated words and wrongly translated words is the same if the number of tokens is similar.",
        "Further, lexical substitution does not rely on structural similarity and can avoid the potential sources of errors encountered at a later processing stage.",
        "Skeleton selection has little impact on the metrics and distinct derivations can result in the same surface structure, giving the same scores, but it is evident that finding the most similar tree improves substitution.",
        "The improvements observed in the 100k experiments are not evident in the metrics when the full Europarl data is used.",
        "The more powerful SMT system is able to handle more translations but manual evaluation reveals a distribution where the majority of rankings for the baseline systems",
        "are in the lower half and rankings for the hybrid systems tend more towards the mid-to-upper rankings, with TED-R having more distribution around the second-best and highest score.",
        "This indicates that the approach creates more accurate translations.",
        "The leaves technique consistently underper-forms lexical substitution, but manual evaluation shows a high correlation between the two methods and their average ranks are similar.",
        "TED-R is ranked higher than the leaves technique in the metrics and manual evaluation also ranks TED-R higher than lexical substitution.",
        "This suggests that the extra surface structure removed is not present in the reference translation and that TED-R is a better implementation of the post-editing approach.",
        "Subtree substitution, whether using leaves or TED, does not handle parentheses, hyphens and numbers well.",
        "The structure severely degrades when performing substitution near these environments.",
        "The example in Table 3 shows the errors made by the substitution algorithm.",
        "An entire subphrase is duplicated using the leaves technique which introduces an opening parenthesis with no closing counterpart and includes the erroneous translation came, while TED-R duplicates / 1999 - 1999 / 2208.",
        "The reason for these wayward substitutions can be found in the dependency tree.",
        "The matching parentheses are not part of the same subtree and this is the root cause of the problem.",
        "The leaves technique is very sensitive to these errors and there is no easy way to prevent spurious parentheses from being introduced.",
        "Re-ranking in TED-R could filter these hypotheses out, but because the re-ranking module cannot model this dependency, the sentences with these errors are not always discarded.",
        "In the manual evaluation campaign, the sentence from Table 3 was included in the sample sentences.",
        "It would seem that the many evaluators did not view this error as impor",
        "tant or it was ignored.",
        "It would be impossible to find the referenced Council decision based on the translations and dates or monetary amounts might change drastically, which would not be acceptable if the translated text should be ready for publishing after translation.",
        "For gisting, where the user knows that the translation is not perfect, this may constitute less of a problem."

        "Experiments using a different RBMT engine should also be conducted.",
        "The RBMT module does not always produce one complete tree structure for a sentence and the reattachment algorithm handles this by adding any additional graphs to the root node of the tree structure.",
        "A RBMT engine that produces complete derivations is likely to improve the translation quality.",
