        "Wordnets for different languages have been created for a quite a long time 1 ; also these wordnets have been developed further and updated with new information.",
        "Typically there is a special software for editing wordnets, for example VisDic2, WordnetLoom (Piasecki et al. 2010), Polaris (Louw, 1998).",
        "These editing tools often present only one kind of view of the data which might not be enough for feedback or for detecting problematic synsets/semantic relations.",
        "The visualization method described here can be used separately from the editing tool; therefore it provides an additional view to data present in wordnet.",
        "For initial data PrWN version 3.03 and EstWN version 63 4 have been taken.",
        "PRWN contains of 117 374 synsets and EstWn of 51 688 synsets.",
        "The creation of EstWN started in 1998 within the EuroWordNet project5.",
        "At present the",
        "main goal is to increase EstWN with new concepts and enrich EstWN with different kinds of semantic relations.",
        "But at the same time it is necessary to check and correct the concepts already present (Kerner, 2010).",
        "The main idea and basic design of all wordnets in the project came from Princeton WordNet (more in Miller et al1990).",
        "Each wordnet is structured along the same lines: synonyms (sharing the same meaning) are grouped into synonym sets (synsets).",
        "Synsets are connected to each other by semantic relations, like hyperonymy (is-a) and meronymy (is-part-of).",
        "As objects of analysis only noun synsets and hyperonymy-hyponymy relations are considered (of course, it is possible to extend the analysis over different word classes and different semantic relations).",
        "So, due to these constraints we have taken 82 115 synsets from PRWN (149 309 different words in synsets) and 41 938 synsets from EstWN (64 747 different words in synsets)."

        "We will explain our method's main idea with a small artificial example.",
        "Let us have a small separated subset presented as a matrix:",

        "On the right side of",
        "that figure we have presented the same data as a bipartite graph where all column numbers are positioned on the upper line and all rows on the lower line.",
        "Every connecting line on the right side has been drawn between every ?1?-s column and row number.",
        "As we see a lot of line crossings there exist even in our very small example.",
        "It is possible to reorder the rows and columns of that table into optimal positions so that the number of line crossings would be minimal possible.",
        "If there is full order then there will be no crossings of lines.",
        "Generally this crossing number minimization is a NP-complete task.",
        "We are using the idea of Stephan Niermann's (2005) evolutionary algorithm to minimize the number of line crossings.",
        "In our example the optimal result will be:",
        "As we can see there are no crossings and all connections are separated into two classes ?",
        "let's call them closed sets.",
        "We have got a nice and natural ordering for rows and columns.",
        "With",
        "that kind of picture the relations between words (synsets) are easier to see and understand.",
        "We will present real cases from PrWN and EstWN later.",
        "3 Practical application of the method",
        "Next we will describe the steps that should be taken in order to obtain visual pictures for lexicographers.",
        "?",
        "First the word class and a semantic relation of interest is chosen from wordnet.",
        "For nouns and verbs hyperonymy and hyponymy are probably the most informative relations, for adjectives and adverbs near_synonymy (but of course this method allows us to choose different semantic relations in combination with different word classes).",
        "?",
        "In order to find closed sets we use the connected component separating algorithm for graphs given in D. Knuth (1968).",
        "For example using hyponym-hyperonym relation and word classes of nouns then there will be 7 907 closed sets for EstWN and 15 452 closed sets for PrWN.",
        "Every closed set is presented in a table as a row with different lengths.",
        "An arbitrary closed set is similar to the following picture in Figure 3.",
        "?",
        "As a next step we use all connections for those two sets in a wordnet to get the relation matrix as it is shown in Figure 1 left part.",
        "?",
        "Then the minimal crossing algorithm is used (result is seen on the right side of Figure 2).",
        "?",
        "As the last step a lexicographer analyzes the figures.",
        "It is still important to mention that our approach is not quite useful for analyzing the large closed sets.",
        "The reason is that in Nierman's evolutionary algorithm if the size of the matrix grows than the time increases with the speed O(n2).",
        "For example, to solve the 30x30 matrix, it takes 3 minutes and to solve 60x60 matrix, it takes 60 minutes.",
        "That is the reason why in this paper only closed sets that do not exceed the 30 hyponym sets are considered.",
        "The pictures from closed sets (Figure 4, 5, 6) were solved as follows: Figure 4 (3 x 5 matrix) 0,28sec, Figure 5 (4 x 11 matrix) 1,5sec, Figure 6 (4 x 12 matrix) 1,7sec.",
        "For larger closed sets it is better to use the modified Power Iteration Clustering method by Lin and Cohen (2010) instead of Niermann's algorithm.",
        "As a matter of fact, the largest closed set in EstWN has 4103 hyponyms-synsets x 405 hyperonym-synsets and the largest closed set in PrWN has 2371 hyponyms-synsets x 167 hyperonym-synsets (Figure 3).",
