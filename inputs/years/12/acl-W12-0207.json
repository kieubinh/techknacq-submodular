        "Particular settings of these variables are associated with the co-occurrences of certain lexico-grammatical features, creating distinctive registers (e.g., the language of linguistics in academic discourse).",
        "We also consider investigations of recent language change, observed, e.g., by (Mair, 2006), who analyses changes in preferences of lexico-grammatical selection in English in the 1960s vs. the 1990s.",
        "As a case study, we show an analysis of modal verbs (falling into the contextual variable of tenor), which we group according to (Biber, 1999) into three categories of meaning that represent three features: obligation, permission and volition (see Table 1)."

        "In this way, we can determine general tendencies (e.g., increase of permission over time) or provide detailed analyses for certain linguistic features and registers by selecting subparts of the data and by highlighting different data dimensions (e.g., comparing changes between different registers).",
