        "Haspelmath 2011, hereafter WALS), we will show that phylogenetic methods represent a unique tool for exploring the relationships between creole languages and other languages of the world and can provide invaluable insights into questions on language birth and evolution.",
        "2.",
        "Classification A number of studies have sought to classify English-based creoles on the basis of shared similarities (Hancock 1969, 1987; McWhorter 1995; Baker 1999 to mention just a few).",
        "The results presented in these studies are in accordance on several higher-level groupings (the West African, the Suriname, and the Eastern/Western Caribbean groups).",
        "We expect therefore to find similar groupings in our results, even though we are using different features and a different method.",
        "The languages selected for this investigation are presented in Hancock's (1987) seminal study on the relationships between 33 Atlantic English-based creoles 2 .",
        "On the basis of these data, Hancock (1987: 324-325) attempted to construct a historical scenario explaining their distribution.",
        "Although he summarized the results in a tree structure, it is worth mentioning that Hancock indicated the influences between varieties with dotted lines, thus foreshadowing the approach advocated here, i.e. when investigating relationships between (especially creole) languages, lateral influences must be taken into account and somehow be graphically depicted.",
        "The 33 languages were analyzed and 62 typological features attesting the presence vs. absence of a particular phenomenon were selected for binary encoding (see also the Supplementary Materials).",
        "The data were used as input for the software SplitsTree v. 4.12.3 (Huson and Bryant 2006) and returned the network presented in Fig. 1.",
        "The geographic location of each variety is indicated with the following colors: blue = Leeward Is., brown = Pacific; green = Caribbean; grey = Suriname; pink = Windward Is.",
        "; red = West Africa; yellow = mainland US.",
        "Several clusters are immediately evident in the network reproduced in Fig. 1.",
        "While the color codes help visualize the geographic distribution of the included languages, the varieties which appear closest to one another also correspond to 2 The full list of languages and features used throughout the essay with the corresponding abbreviations is found in the Supplementary Materials.",
        "nothing else (the Feature Pool hypothesis); and finally, iv) no language in particular and creole similarities are to be explained by restructuring universals, where similar solutions were found in order to optimize communication (the universalist approach).",
        "These approaches are not necessarily mutually exclusive (e.g. Mufwene 1986).",
        "In order to determine whether the predictions made by the various theories accounting for the emergence and development of creoles are borne out by the facts, a sample of creoles and non-creole languages was carefully selected and binary oppositions were encoded according to the 97 morphosyntactic features presented in Holm and Patrick's Comparative Creole Syntax (Holm and Patrick 2007, henceforth CCS).",
        "The 18 creoles originally described in the Holm and Patrick volume were included, as well as languages known to be involved in the creation of the creoles.",
        "Apart from the 18 CCS creoles, we included 19 substrates, 7 lexifiers, as well as 8 non-creoles, selected because of their analytic character and relative low complexity so as to match the character of creoles (see Bakker et al. 2011).",
        "In order to facilitate the interpretation of the figures, it should be kept in mind that the abbreviations used in each network provide the following information: a three-letter code was attributed to each language and written in upper-case for creoles and in lower-case for all non-creoles.",
        "A further distinction is made in all the abbreviations, where an initial capital letter (L, S or X) indicates whether the language is a lexifier, a substrate or a non-creole respectively, while a lower-case ?c?",
        "precedes all the abbreviations for the creoles.",
        "In the following, with the help of phylogenetic networks, we will test the predictions made by each of the four major proposals seeking to account for the emergence and development of creoles.",
        "3.1 The superstratist view The main idea within the superstratist framework is that the structural similarities between creoles are due to the role played by the superstrate (or lexifier) language in the period of creole formation.",
        "Thus, in this view, creoles are mere continuations of the European languages which provided the bulk of their lexicon and are thus genetically related to their lexifiers.",
        "Moreover, according to Mufwene (e.g. 2000, 2008) and Chaudenson (1992, 2003), creolization results from normal language change under particular sociohistorical circumstances and is more a sociological process rather than a linguistic one, and therefore creoles are in this view indistinguishable from non-creoles structurally and typologically.",
        "In order to test the validity of the superstratist approach, we produced a network",
        "The study conducted by Parkvall (2008) was the first to make use of quantitative cross-linguistic data for creoles, and the results presented strongly suggested that creoles are structurally distinguishable from non-creoles from a simplicity point of view.",
        "In his investigation of the complexity of creoles, Parkvall selected 43 features, 37 of which were taken directly from the WALS (Dryer and Haspelmath 2011), with a further six added by that author.",
        "These features were used to calculate the relative complexity of the 155 languages included in the WALS for which at least 30 features were known (see Parkvall 2008 for the selection criteria).",
        "He then added data on 30 creoles and pidgins with diverse lexifiers (2008: 278), some of which are also found in the CCS sample: Dominican, Guinea Bissau, Haitian, Jamaican, Nubi, Negerhollands, Palenquero and Tok Pisin, i.e. almost half of the Holm and Patrick sample.",
        "Parkvall interpreted his results as evidence that creoles are structurally less complex than other natural languages.",
        "Consequently, another conclusion reached by the author was that creoles form a typological group characterized by a relatively low level of structural complexity.",
        "The dataset used by Parkvall (2008) also served to provide additional evidence that creoles do indeed form a typological group (Bakker et al. 2011) on the basis of a quantitative empirical analysis.",
        "The strongest piece of evidence Bakker et al's (2011) large-scale investigation presents relies on Parkvall's (2008) data: 34 creoles and pidgins distinctly cluster in a network including 155 non-creole languages of the world.",
        "However, the validity of the results is somewhat undermined by the fact that the data which allowed the authors to reach this conclusion were specifically selected on the basis of creole properties, in that Parkvall selected the features in WALS that could be quantified in terms of complexity (e.g. presence versus absence of a grammatical distinction, or less versus more of a particular phenomenon).",
        "Thus, one could object that the results do not really reflect what the authors claim them to (see also Kouwenberg 2010 for a critical assessment).",
        "In order to provide additional, and this time irrefutable evidence, these results must be replicated with different samples and different features.",
        "This is what will be attempted in this section, first with the CCS languages and features used in the previous section, then with various samples of WALS languages and features.",
        "4.2 Using the CCS features and languages The morphosyntactic features described in Holm and Patrick (2007) are divided up into 20 overarching categories covering various areas (such as TMA systems, NPs or relativization strategies), which were reduced to 18 binary features by selecting for each category the feature(s) that were shared by most creoles.",
        "The major linguistic families are indicated with colors in order to facilitate the interpretation of",
        "more specifically on the relationships between creoles and other languages, both creoles and non-creoles.",
        "The problem of the classification of creoles was shown to be a manageable task with the help of phylogenetic networks.",
        "The various theories seeking to account for the similarities between creoles were investigated with the help of phylogenetic networks, and it was found that the chosen analysis was advantageous in that it allowed to graphically represent the relationships between the various languages involved in the emergence of creoles.",
        "Finally, the controversial question of whether creoles form a distinguishable subgroup among the world's languages was similarly satisfactorily answered using phylogenetic trees.",
        "Moreover, we introduced different ways of depicting the results, where color codes were used so as to instantly identify linguistic patterns.",
        "The availability of freely accessible online databases is constantly increasing, and the prospects for future research are many in the perspective of the interplay between computational methods and linguistics, and, more specifically, in the context of creole languages, as their emegence raise questions on the very nature of language evolution as well.",
