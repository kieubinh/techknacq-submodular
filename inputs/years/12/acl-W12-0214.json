        "The first AustKin project (AustKin I) collected a large database of kinship terms from Aboriginal languages all over Australia, endeavouring to maintain standards of spelling, kin formulae and group identities, without losing the details of original sources used.",
        "An online geospatial interface has been used to map distributions of forms of terms and their polysemies or equations.",
        "The patterns of the latter provide identification of kinship systems as defined in ethnology.",
        "The project proposed and tested hypotheses about the evolution of such systems in Australia based on knowledge of the common polysemies and related changes.",
        "The next stage, AustKin II, builds on hypotheses from the current authors and others, testing these further by adding two more components to the database: the marriage rules and the social categories used by each group.",
        "Of the latter, section and subsection systems are unique to Australia.",
        "The aim is to gauge how these different systems fit together and propose how they evolved over time and how they influenced each other.",
        "1.The AustKin project 1.1The design of the AustKin database.",
        "The AustKin database documents words in the domain of kinship terminologies for 316 Australian languages or dialects (which could be grouped into about 200 languages, depending on criteria used).",
        "The 3i6 languages/dialects have an average of approximately two different wordlists each.",
        "from different ethnographic or historical sources for each language or dialect, with a total of over 22 000 words that belong to the domain of kinship.",
        "Designing a database and an interface to such a database has revealed itself to be a complex matter since the number and diversity of variables that need to be taken into account are considerable.",
        "In summary, the following had to be taken into account: A ?",
        "Systemic variables 1) Kinship terminologies are not just words, but also relationships; and in particular they are related among each other.",
        "2) A kinship terminology constitutes a system; but not all kinship terminologies belong to the same type of system.",
        "3) Kinship terminologies change and they need to be placed against their chronological and historical background.",
        "B ?",
        "Sporadic variables 1) Kinship terminologies are recorded by humans, and often by non-linguists; they include errors.",
        "2) Kinship terminologies are seldom complete, and need to be completed when possible through other sources.",
        "3) Original Informants may not always have been local speakers.",
        "Arriving at, or at least proposing, potential solutions to the B-type variables was not as difficult as it may appear.",
        "The solution chosen was to keep each kin term in its original form as it appears in the original source, while working with rewritten words (for instance those in an orthography standard for the whole database) linked to the original source, so as to be able to retrace every step of transformation and analysis",
        "undertaken for each kinship term and system.",
        "The standard orthography used for comparison is based on common ground between practical orthographies in use, and can be entered on a normal keyboard, rather than for instance the Interenational Phonetic Alphabet.",
        "We have also chosen to record as many as possible sets for each language and to investigate these in parallel.",
        "And further, the individual researchers had the opportunity to create a ?canonical?",
        "set out of these various and often partial word lists for analytical purposes.",
        "Here again, it was important to be able to trace steps and modifications.",
        "Therefore, each such canonical set is attributed to a participant of the team, and each participant of the team can create his or her own canonical set, or create other types of sets of words based on typologies or groupings the researcher is interested in.",
        "1.2 Standardisation of kinterm meanings Kinship terms can generally be described using the following elementary idiom, which is in one form or another applied in anthropology and linguistics, but which we have to some degree adapted to our needs.",
        "Females: M = Mother (one generation above, direct line) Z = Sister (same generation, identical link to M or F) D = Daughter (one generation below, direct line) W = Wife (same generation, alliance, reciprocal of H) Males: F = Father (one generation above, direct line) B = Brother (same gen., identical link to M or F) S = Son (one generation below, direct line) H =Husband (same generation, alliance, reciprocal of W) Additionally, since this element is in some cases structurally significant, the following two codes are used to indicate relative age difference: e = elder y = younger Also, for some terms, the gender of the propositus needs to be detailed: f=female; m = male.",
        "The ?propositus?",
        "refers to e.g. ?John?",
        "in ?John's father?.",
        "Thus, for example, a man's patrilateral female cross-cousin is a father's sister's daughter and is coded as mFZD.",
        "Terms for grandchildren require this distinction of gender of propositus to be made.",
        "For instance the reciprocal of MM is fDS or fDD, whereas the reciprocal of MF is mDS or mDD.",
        "?Cross?",
        "in the term ?cross-cousin?",
        "means that there is difference in gender between the first two kin links in the kintype e.g. beween ?mother?",
        "and ?brother?",
        "in MBD and ?father?",
        "and ?sister?",
        "in FZD.",
        "The obverse is ?parallel?, where the gender of the two links is the same, as in the parallel cousins MZD and FBD.",
        "In many kinship systems around the world, including in Australia, this is a fundamental distinction: for instance ?cross-cousins?",
        "can frequently marry, whereas parallel cousins are classed as siblings, and cannot marry.",
        "?Cross?",
        "and ?parallel?",
        "are also used for other relations e.g. MF is a cross-grandparent and MM is a parallel grandparent.",
        "The way of coding by letters concatenated into strings representing kintypes allows for the search and establishment of equivalences (also known as ?equations?",
        "or ?polysemies?).",
        "For example, if after searching for equivalences, the words for MBD and FZD are found to be identical in some languages, then we can assume that cross-cousins are not distinguished according to father's or mother's line.",
        "Such conclusions have important consequences for the identification, for example, of so-called skewed systems).",
        "In such systems, the equivalences are between vertically adjacent generations, for instance an MBD can be called M in an Omaha system, which identifies relatives linked vertically in the male line.",
        "1.3 Kinterm polysemies and kinship systems A well-used search function in the AustKin database is the polysemy search.",
        "This finds languages in which specific kin types are united in one kin term.",
        "So to take the examples already mentioned, we can use this function to find languages in which MBD=FZD, or MBD=M.",
        "These instances of polysemy can then be mapped on-line using the geo-spatial interface of AustKin.",
        "The actual forms of these terms can also be mapped using another search function and overlays of language families and subgroups used to get a preliminary idea of whether the forms and the polysemies are correlated with linguistic groupings.",
        "These polysemies are the prime features which identify what we know as ?kinship systems?.",
        "MBD=FZD, for instance, is a symmetrical system of cross-cousin terminology and, as discussed in the section on AustKin II, tends to be associated with symmetrical cross-cousin marriage.",
        "On the other hand, if MBD ?",
        "FZD (the terms for the kin types are different) then this an asymmetrical system, associated with asymmetrical marriage in many cases.",
        "MBD =M is a feature of an Omaha skewing system.",
        "Even in the case of skewing, it is often the case that there is variability between the use of separate or the same term depending on social and discourse contexts, remarked also for other types of systems in Australia (Dousset, 2002, 2003) as well as elsewhere in the world by Kronenfeld (2009).",
        "The database allows coding of such contexts of variation.",
        "From Morgan (1997 [1871]) on, it has been remarked that there is a limited set of ways in which kinship terminologies vary, and there have been several attempts to codify these as named systems.",
        "The normal usage of the term ?kinship system?",
        "in anthropology emphasises patterns of equivalence as discussed in the above paragraphs Systems which have more than one diagnostic equation can be plotted using the AustKin database.",
        "The ?Kariera?",
        "system, named after a language group reputedly with this pattern in its full form, exhibits several equations and non-equations in the grandparental generation MM=FFZ?FM=MFZ; FF=MMB?MF=FMB; This type of system also usually has the symmetrical cross-cousin pattern FZD=MBD, FZS=MBS .",
        "However, adding additional criteria for these named types may not be best practice.",
        "Rather, one of the strategies we have followed in AustKin I research is to propose hypotheses about which are the most robust diagnostic patterns and then verify empirically in our database the extent to which other patterns can be predicted by the most diagnostic pattern of polysemy, e.g. the grandparental equations or non-equations cited above for ?Kariera?",
        "(McConvell and Hendery, to appear).",
        "?Kariera?",
        "itself can be considered as a subtype of the Dravidian system, found in many societies on all continents, where ?cross?",
        "and ?parallel?",
        "relatives are rigorously distinguished.",
        "However, in the Australian Kariera systems this characteristic of distinguishing cross and parallel is found strongly expressed in the grandparental generation, whereas elsewhere in the world this may not be the case.",
        "Kariera is only one of the systems in Australia.",
        "Others include the ?Aranda?",
        "system in which MM?FFZ?FM?MFZ; FF?MMB?MF?FMB in other words, twice the number of distinctive terms.",
        "Other kinds of systems are those with asymmetrical cross-cousin terms (eg FZD?MBD) and asymmetrical grandparent terms, which form a kind of halfway house between Kariera and Aranda, for instance MM?FFZ?FM=MFZ; FF?MMB?MF=FMB One system which neutralises the cross-parallel division found in Kariera is the so-called ?Aluridja?",
        "system.",
        "In some such systems the main feature is the neutralisation of distinctions between cross-cousins and parallel cousins/siblings.",
        "In some systems, such as in the Western Desert, the distinction between cross and parallel grandparents is also neutralised yielding a system like the modern European grandmother-grandfather terminology.",
        "1.4 Reconstruction of proto-forms, proto meanings and proto-systems While anthropological (ethnological) research on kinship has sometimes been comparative, producing synchronic typologies of systems, it has rarely focused on diachronic change and reconstruction.",
        "Even the work on transformations from Levi-Strauss to more recent significant work such as Godelier et al. (1998) has not tied transformations to times, places and lexical forms.",
        "In linguistics, however, there has been a current of research on reconstructing kinship terms and systems (e.g. Blust, 1980; Whistler, 1980), but not in Australia.",
        "Our aim in the AustKin project has been to apply the comparative method to Australian kinship data using systematic querying of databases, and marry the results to anthropological work.",
        "One of the key issues in kinship reconstruction is understanding and prediction of types of semantic change.",
        "A guiding principle has been that most semantic change happens via a stage of polysemy.",
        "In our database we can find instances of polysemy A=B which lie between meaning A",
        "and meaning B.",
        "So for instance we can map M=MBD and MB=MBS, two of the key Omaha equations.",
        "These show distributions of this polysemy (with different forms of kinship terms) in various areas (Figure 1, see McConvell, in press).",
        "Figure 1: Omaha skewing polysemies in Northern Australia These polysemy patterns have implications for the change in meaning of terms and their reconstruction.",
        "Note that one of the languages with an Omaha skewing pattern in Figure 1 is Ayabadhu in eastern Cape York Peninsula.",
        "Now look at the distribution of cognates of the root for MB in Ayabadhu (kaala) in Figure 2.",
        "The MB meanings are all clustered around Cape York Peninsula in the Paman subgroup of Pama-Nyungan and to some extent south of there (the left-side blue half-arrows).",
        "However there are also cognates scattered north-west into Yolngu, in North-east Arnhem Land, west into Ngumpin-Yapa, south-east into Southern Queensland and Northern New South Wales.",
        "All these latter forms of the root (the right-side red half-arrows) have the meaning of (matrilateral) cross-cousin and/or spouse or sibling-in-law (the latter polysemy change is due to cross-cousin marriage).",
        "The hypothesis to explain this striking pattern is that the original meaning is MB, as reconstructed in proto-Paman, but also, we suggest, in proto-Pama-Nyungan.",
        "The meaning change to MB's child (MBD/MBS) and subsequently extended to spouse through another common polysemy, is due to the existence of Omaha skewing in Paman languages, which is the bridge between the uncle and cousin/spouse meaning.",
        "This bridge remains intact in the form of a polysemy in some languages such as Ayabadhu."

      "heading": "2.1 Marriage rules In Aboriginal Australia, marriages take place between kinship categories or classes, not just between individuals, lineages, clans or moieties. A preferential or prescribed wife for a male propositus may be a MBD (mother's brother's daughter); or she may be a MMBDD (mother's mother's brother's daughter's daughter), or she may be a classificatory ? not actual - DD (daughter's daughter) etc. In most cases, the hypothesis can be advanced that the kinship terminologies which are part of the AustKin I database are coherent with this new database that will record and map the marriage relationships. Earlier attempts at typologies of kinship systems often included marriage rules in the definition of kinship systems. This would not be a wise precedent for us to follow. We know for instance that sometimes the marriage systems do not ?fit? exactly with the kinship terminologies. Because of our concern with change we also need to record such cases very carefully as they may represent ?phasing in? of a kinship terminology or marriage system not totally in harmony with each other due to time-lag between them, or competition between different systems exerting influence on a group. It is important to record marriage rules separately from kinship systems to compare them as independent factors. In many cases there is a main ?straight? marriage partner recognized, and this person can be designated by a kin type e.g. MBD for a man. These are often classificatory rather than actual cross-cousins, and in some groups actual first cross-cousins are unmarriageable. For many systems though there is a hierarchy of preference for marriageable kin types. Among the Gurindji for instance, for a man the MMBDD is the ?first choice?, but a cross-cousin MBD/FZD is second choice, and so on. There is a need then for a ranked coding of marriage options, using kin types, with other systems and cultural categories being brought in where necessary. Some marriage systems may be a good deal more complex than this, even at the level of ideal rules, involving, for instance, preference for certain other clans or language groups, geographic exogamy, or contingent dispreference for marriage with families with whom marriage had been contracted in previous generations, generating a pattern Keen (2002) calls ?shifting webs?. Where these factors are systematic they should be allowed for in our coding protocols.",

Sections and subsections are named sociocentric divisions, four and eight respectively. Each occurs in separate regions with a little overlap between them The sections are made up of a set pf classificatory or fictive parallel kin of the same or harmonic (+2 or -2) generations In subsections each section is divided into two, with those who are classificatory mother's mother('s siblings) and woman's daughter's children to each other separated into a different subsection from siblings and father's father('s siblings).

      "heading": "2.3 Analysis of synchronic and diachronic relationships between kin, skins and marriage In relation to Australia here has been a tradition of combining kinship terminology, marriage rules and social categories (sections and subsections) into a unitary ?kinship system? in which these elements are inextricably connected by close functional cohesion. This perception of how Australian systems operate became especially influential due to analyses of section systems by anthropologists exploring componential approaches such as Burling (1962), Often this nglects the relative independence and differing histories of these elements. More significantly for our project, such an approach does not facilitate comparison and the tracing of diachronic interactions of kinship terminology, marriage and social categories which we have identified as a major goal. We need to design the AustKin II database so that these elements are in separate modules but their relationships can be tracked both visualization by historical-geographical maps and subject to statistical analysis showing how closely the elements match with each other. We already have standard assumptions which we can recast as hypotheses and pay close attention to the mismatches and deviations. Beyond these three components there is also a demographic one, in particular how actual marriage patterns relate to maintenance and change of marriage rules, kinship systems and social categories. The possibility of ?bottlenecks? leading to change in social category systems has been mentioned? this relates both to marriage patterns, general interaction and perhaps population size and density.

        "Another more wide ranging hypothesis to which we pay attention is that of White and Denham (2009), where the functional advantage of types of kinship systems such as Omaha skewing and social categories like sections and subsections lies in their driving force towards exogamy, rescuing small groups from otherwise almost certain demographic collapse.",

        "If our historical reconstruction work can begin to find relative or even absolute dates for these institutional changes, we can contribute to debate which has gone on for some time over whether the type of society of recent times in Australia is very ancient or whether there was a major change, perhaps related to ?intensification?",

      "heading": "4. Conclusions The study of the evolution of Australian kinship systems and the relationship between them and marriage and social category (?skins?) systems is significant not just for Australia. It has been claimed by Allen (1998) that the primordial world social organization was based on a ?tetradic? structure similar to sections, from which evolved Dravidian-Kariera systems. Hage (2003) claimed to have found ?Kariera? systems in proto-languages in many part of the world. If the earliest kinship systems we can detect in Australia by our reconstruction methods are Kariera, then this adds some weight to the world primordial (or very early) Dravidian-Kariera hypothesis, but is by no means convincing, as we are probably dealing with proto-languages of not much more than 5000 years in age. A similar problem of relative short age also besets the idea that Australian sections may be relics of a very early human type of social organization. It may be that sections are in fact younger than the proto-languages e.g. proto-Pama-Nyungan) and this is something AustKin II may be able to find out.In order to give credible answers to such questions we should not indulge in speculation, as so many have. We have some good methods in linguistics and ethnology and these have to be put to work systematically.",
