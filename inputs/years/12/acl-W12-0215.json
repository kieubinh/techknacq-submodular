        "We can evaluate the models based on how good they are at discovering rules.",
        "(Wettig et al., 2011) showed that aligning multiple symbols captures some of the context and thereby finds more complex rules than their 1-1 alignment model.",
        "However, certain alignments, such as t?t/d, p?p/b, and k?k/g between Finnish and Estonian, cannot be explained by the multiple-symbol model.",
        "This is due to the rule of voicing of word-medial plosives in Estonian.",
        "This rule could be expressed in terms of Two-level Morphology, (Koskenniemi, 1983) as: a voiceless plosive in Finnish, may correspond to voiced in Estonian, if not word-initial.",
        "The context model finds this rule, shown in Fig. 5.",
        "This tree codes the Target-level (i.e., Estonian) Voiced consonant feature.",
        "In each node, the counts of corresponding feature values are shown in brackets.",
        "In the root node?prior to knowing anything about the environment?there is almost complete uncertainty (i.e., high entropy) about the value of Voiced feature of an Estonian consonant: 821 voiceless to 801 voiced in our data.",
        "Redder nodes indicate higher entropy, bluer nodes?lower entropy.",
        "The query in the root node tells us to check the context Finnish Itself Voiced for the most informative clue about whether the current Estonian consonant is voiced or not.",
        "Tracing the options down left to right from the root, we obtain the rules.",
        "The leftmost branch says, if the Finnish is voiced (?",
        "), then the Estonian is almost certainly voiced as well?615 voiced to 2 voiceless in this case.",
        "If the Finnish is voiceless (Finnish Itself Voiced = ), it says voicing may occur, but only in the red nodes?i.e., only if preceded by a voiced consonant on Estonian level (the branch marked by ?, 56 cases), or?if previous position is not a consonant (the 6= branch indicates that the candidate's query does not apply: i.e., the sound found in that position is not a consonant)?",
        "it can be voiced only if the corresponding Finnish is a plosive (P, 78 cases).",
        "The blue nodes in this branch say that otherwise, the Estonian consonant almost certainly remains voiceless.",
        "The context models discover numerous complex rules for different language pairs.",
        "For example, they learn a rule that initial Finnish k ?changes?",
        "(corresponds) to h in Hungarian, if it is followed by a back vowel; the correspondence between Komi trills and Udmurt sibilants; etc.",
        "Imputation: We introduce a novel test of the quality of the models, by using them to impute unseen data, as follows.",
        "For a given model, and a language pair (L1, L2)?e.g., (Finnish, Estonian)?hold out one word pair, and train the model on the remaining data.",
        "Then show the model the hidden Finnish word and let it guess 3In fact, phonetically, in modern spoken Estonian, the consonants that are written using the symbols b,d,g are not technically voiced, but that is a finer point, we use this rule for illustration of the principle.",
        "the corresponding Estonian.",
        "Imputation can be done for all models with a simple dynamic programming algorithm, similar to the Viterbi-like search used during training.",
        "Formally, given the hidden Finnish string, the imputation procedure selects from all possible Estonian strings the most probable Estonian string, given the model.",
        "We then compute an edit distance between the imputed sting and the true withheld Estonian word (e.g., using the Levenshtein distance).",
        "We repeat this procedure for all word pairs in the (L1, L2) data set, sum the edit distances and normalize by the total size of the (true) L2 data?this yields the Normalized Edit Distance NED(L2|L1,M) between L1 and L2, under model M .",
        "Imputation is a more intuitive measure of the model's quality than code length, with a clear practical interpretation.",
        "NED is also the ultimate test of the model's quality.",
        "If model M imputes better than M ?",
        "?i.e., NED(L2|L1,M) < NED(L2|L1,M ?",

        "it has learned more about the regularities between L1 and L2, and it knows more about L2 given L1.",
        "The context model, which has much lower cost than the baseline, almost always has lower NED.",
        "This also yields an important insight: it is an encouraging indication that optimizing the code length is a good approach?the algorithm does not optimize NED directly, and yet the cost correlates strongly with NED, which is a simple and intuitive measure of the model's quality."

        "The models take only the etymological data set as input, and require no further linguistic assumptions.",
        "In this regard, they is as objective as possible, given the data.",
        "The data set itself, of course, may be highly subjective and questionable.",
        "The objectivity of models given the data now opens new possibilities for comparing entire data sets.",
        "For example, we can begin to compare the Finnish and Estonian datasets in SSA vs. StarLing, although the data sets have quite different characteristics, e.g., different size?3200 vs. 800 word pairs, respectively?and the comparison is done impartially, relying solely on the data provided.",
        "Another direct consequence of the presented methods is that they enable us to quantify uncertainty of entries in the corpus of etymological data.",
        "For example, for a given entry x in language L1, we can compute exactly the probability that x would be imputed by any of the models, trained on all the remaining data from L1 plus any other set of languages in the family.",
        "This can be applied equally to any entry, in particular to entries marked dubious by the database creators.",

        "The cost of an optimal alignment obtained over a given data set serves as a measure of its internal consistency.",
        "We are currently working to combine the context model with 3 and higher-dimensional models, and to extend these models to perform diachronic imputation, i.e., reconstruction of proto-forms.",
        "We also intend to test the models on databases of other language families."
