        "This paper reports on work in progress that is aimed at providing domain-specific automated style checking to support German-language legislative editing in the Swiss federal administration.",
        "In the federal administration of the Swiss Confederation, drafts of new acts and ordinances go through several editorial cycles.",
        "In a majority of cases, they are originally written by civil servants in one of the federal offices concerned, and then reviewed and edited both by legal experts (at the Federal Office of Justice) and language experts (at the Federal Chancellery).",
        "While the former ensure that the drafts meet al relevant legal requirements, the latter are concerned with the formal and linguistic quality of the texts.",
        "To help this task, the authorities have drawn up style guidelines specifically geared towards Swiss legislative texts (Bundeskan-zlei, 2003; Bundesamt f?r Justiz, 2007).",
        "Style guidelines for laws (and other types of legal texts) may serve three main purposes: (i) improving the understandability of the texts (Lerch, 2004; Wydick, 2005; Mindlin, 2005; Butt and Castle, 2006; Eichhoff-Cyrus and Antos, 2008), (ii) enforcing their consistency with related texts, and (iii) facilitating their translatability into other languages.",
        "These aims are shared with writing guidelines developed for controlled languages in the domain of technical documentation (Lehrndor-fer, 1996; Reuther, 2003; Muegge, 2007).",
        "The problem is that the manual assessment of draft laws for their compliance with all relevant style guidelines is time-consuming and easily inconsistent due to the number of authors and editors involved in the drafting process.",
        "The aim of the work presented in this paper is to facilitate this process by providing methods for a consistent automatic identification of some specific guideline violations.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organised as follows.",
        "We first delineate the aim and scope of the project presented in the paper (section 2) and the approach we are pursuing (section 3).",
        "In the main part of the paper, we then identify and discuss the two main challenges that have to be tackled: the technical challenge of providing NLP methods for legislative drafts (section 4) and the linguistic challenge of concretising the existing drafting guidelines for legislative texts (section 5)."

        "The aim of the project to be presented in this paper is to develop methods of automated style checking specifically geared towards legislative editing, and to implement these methods in a prototypical tool (cf. sections 3 and 4).",
        "We work towards automat",
        "ically detecting violations of existing guidelines, and where these guidelines are very abstract, we concretise them so that they become detectable by machine (cf. section 5).",
        "However, it is explicitly not the goal of our project to propose novel style rules.",
        "We have adopted a broad conception of ?style checking?",
        "that is roughly equivalent to how the term, and its variant ?controlled language checking,?",
        "have been used in the context of technical writing (Geldbach, 2009).",
        "It comprises the assessment of various aspects of text composition controlled by specific writing guidelines (typographical conventions, lexical preferences, syntax-related recommendations, constraints on discourse and document structure), but it does not include the evaluation of spelling and grammar.",
        "While our project focuses on style checking for German-language Swiss federal laws (the federal constitution, acts of parliament, ordinances, federal decrees, cantonal constitutions), we believe that the challenges arising from the task are independent of the chosen language and legislative system but pertain to the domain in general."

      "text": [
        "The most important innovative contribution of our project is the enhancement of the method of error modelling to meet the requirements of legislative editing.",
        "Error modelling means that texts are searched for specific features that indicate a style guideline violation: the forms of specific ?errors?",
        "are thus anticipated and modelled.",
        "The method of error modelling has mainly been developed for automated style checking in the domain of technical writing.",
        "Companies often control the language used in their technical documentation in order to improve the understandability, readability and translatability of these texts.",
        "Controlled language checkers are tools that evaluate input texts for compliance with such style guidelines set up by a company.1 State-of-the-art controlled language checkers work along the following lines.",
        "In a preprocessing step, they first perform an automatic analysis of the input text (tokenisation, text segmentation, morphological analysis, part-of-speech tagging, parsing) and enrich it with the respective structural and linguistic information.",
        "They then apply a number of predefined rules that model potential ?errors?",
        "(i.e. violations of individual style guidelines) and aim at detecting them in the analysed text.",
        "Most checkers give their users the option to choose which rules the input text is to be checked for.",
        "Once a violation of the company's style guidelines has been detected, the respective passage is highlighted and an appropriate help text is made available to the user (e.g. as a comment in the original document or in an extra document generated by the system).",
        "The system we are working on is constructed along the same lines; its architecture is outlined in Fig. 1.",
        "Transferring the described method to the domain of legislative editing has posed challenges to both preprocessing and error modelling.",
        "The peculiarities of legal language and legislative texts have necessitated a range of adaptations in the NLP procedures devised, and the guidelines for legislative drafting have required highly domain-specific",
        "error modelling, which needed to be backed up by substantial linguistic research.",
        "We will detail these two sets of challenges in the following two sections."

        "Our text segmentation tool detects the boundaries of chapters, sections, articles, paragraphs, sentences and enumeration elements, and marks them by adding corresponding XML tags to the text.",
        "There are three reasons why text segmentation",
        "is crucial to our endeavour: 1.",
        "Proper text segmentation ensures that only",
        "relevant token spans are passed on to further processing routines (e.g. sentences contained in articles must to be passed on to the parser, whereas article numbers or section headings must not).",
        "2.",
        "Most structural units are themselves the object of style rules (e.g. ?sections should not contain more than twelve articles, articles should not contain more than three paragraphs and paragraphs should not contain more than one sentence?).",
        "The successful detection of violations of such rules depends on the correct delimitation of the respective structural units in the text.",
        "3.",
        "Certain structural units constitute the context for other style rules (e.g. ?the sentence right before the first element of an enumeration has to end in a colon?",
        "; ?the antecedent of a pronoun must be within the same article?).",
        "Here too, correct text segmentation constitutes the prerequisite for an automated assessment of the respective style rules.",
        "We have devised a line-based pattern-matching algorithm with look-around to detect the boundaries of the structural units of legislative drafts (H?fler and Piotrowski, 2011).",
        "The algorithm also exploits formatting information extracted together with the text from the Word documents.",
        "However, not all formatting information has proven equally reliable: as the Word documents in which the drafts are composed do only make use of style environments to a very limited extent, formatting errors are relatively frequent.",
        "Font properties such as italics or bold face, or the use of list environments are frequently erroneous and can thus not be exploited for the purpose of delimiting text segments; headers and newline information, on the other hand, have proven relatively reliable.",

        "To solve the problem, we combine the output of TreeTag-ger's part-of-speech tagging with the lemma information delivered by the morphology analysis tool GERTWOL (Haapalainen and Majorin, 1995).",

        "An example is the rule pertaining to the use of the modal sollen (?should?).",
        "The drafting guidelines forbid the use of this modal except in statements of purpose.",
        "Statements of purpose thus constitute a special context inside which the detection of an instance of sollen is not to trigger an error message.",
        "Other examples of contexts in which special style rules apply are transitional provisions (?bergangsbestimmungen), repeals and amendments of current legislation (Aufhebungen und ?n-derungen bisherigen Rechts), definitions of the",
        "subject of a law (Gegenstandsbestimmungen), definitions of the scope of a law (Geltungsbereichsbestimmungen), definitions of terms (Begriffsbestimmungen), as well as preambles (Pr?ambeln) and commencement clauses (Ingresse).",
        "A number of these contexts can be identified automatically by assessing an article's position in the text and certain keywords contained in its header.",
        "A statements of purpose, for instance, is usually the first article of a law, and its header usually contains the words Zweck (?purpose?)",
        "or Ziel (?aim?).",
        "Similar rules can be applied to recognise transitional provisions, repeals and amendments of current legislation, and definitions of the subject and the scope of a law.",

        "Definitions of terms, for instance, do not only occur as separate articles at the beginning of a law; they can also appear in the form of individual sentences throughout the text.",
        "As there is a whole range of style rules pertaining to legal definitions (e.g. ?a term must only be defined if it occurs at least three times in the text?",
        "; ?a term must only be defined once within the same text?",
        "; ?a term must not be defined by itself?",
        "), the detection of this particular context (and its components: the term and the actual definition) is crucial to a style checker for legislative texts.5 To identify legal definitions in the text, we have begun to adopt strategies developed in the context of legal information retrieval: Walter and Pinkal (2009) and de Maat and Winkels (2010), for instance, show that definitions in German court decisions and in Dutch laws respectively can be detected by searching for combinations of key words and sentence patterns typically used in these domain-specific contexts.",
        "In H?fler et al. (2011) we have argued that this approach is also feasible with regard to Swiss legislative texts: our pilot study has shown that a substantial number of legal definitions can be detected even without resorting to syntactic analyses, merely by searching for typical string patterns such as ?X im Sinne dieser Verordnung ist/sind Y?",
        "(?X in the sense of this ordinance is/are Y?).",
        "We are currently working towards refining and extending the detection of legal definitions by including additional syntactic information yielded by the processes of chunking and parsing into the search patterns.",
        "5Further rules for the use of legal definitions in Swiss law texts are provided by Bratschi (2009).",
        "Once the legal definitions occurring in a draft have been marked, the aforementioned style rules can be checked automatically (e.g. by searching the text for terms that are defined in a definition but occur less than three times in the remainder of the text; by checking if there are any two legal definitions that define the same term; by assessing if there are definitions where the defined term also occurs in the actual definition).",
        "After having outlined some of the main challenges that the peculiarities of legal language and legislative texts pose to the various preprocessing tasks, we now turn to the process of error modelling, i.e. the effort of transferring the guidelines for legislative drafting into concrete error detection mechanisms operating on the preprocessed texts."

        "The formalisation of some other rules is somewhat more complicated but can still be derived more or less directly.",

        "Abstract Rules However, guidelines for legislative drafting frequently contain rules that define relatively abstract constraints.",

        "Even if one ignores the fact that the definite article in letters a and b is in fact not the same as the one in letter c (the former being plural, the latter singular), it is quite apparent that articles cannot be extracted from the elements of an enumeration without the nouns they specify.",
        "Even the seemingly simple rule in question is thus in need of a more linguistically informed concretisation before it can be effectively checked by machine.",
        "The examples illustrate that style guidelines for legislative writing are often kept at a level of abstraction that necessitates concretisations if one is to detect violations of the respective rules automatically.",
        "Besides the development of domain-specific preprocessing algorithms, the extensive and highly specialised linguistic research required for such concretisations constitutes the main task being tackled in this project.",
        "Conflicting Rules A further challenge to error modelling arises from the fact that a large proportion of drafting guidelines for legislative texts do not constitute absolute constraints but rather have the status of general writing principles and rules of thumb.",
        "This fact has to be reflected in the feedback messages that the system gives to its users: what the tool detects are often not ?errors?",
        "in the proper sense of the word but merely passages that the author or editor may want to reconsider.",
        "The fact that many style rules only define soft constraints also means that there may be conflicting rules.",
        "Consider, for instance, sentence (5):",
        "monetary penalty despite being granted an extended deadline for payment or a reduced daily penalty unit or fails to perform the community service despite being warned of the consequences, the alternative custodial sentence is executed.",
        "On the one hand, this sentence must be considered a violation of the style rule that states that the main verb of a sentence (here execute) should be introduced as early as possible (Regierungsrat des Kantons Z?rich, 2005, p. 73).",
        "On the other hand, if the sentence was rearranged in compliance with this rule ?",
        "by switching the order of the main clause and the subsidiary clause ?",
        "it would violate the rule stating that information is to be presented in temporal and causal order (Bundesamt f?r Justiz, 2007, p. 354).",
        "This latter rule entails that the condition precedes its consequence.",
        "To be able to deal with such conflicting constraints, error detection strategies have to be assigned weights.",
        "However, one and the same rule may have different weights under different circumstances.",
        "In conditional sentences like the one shown above, the causality principle obviously weighs more than the rule that the main verb must be introduced early in the sentence.",
        "Such context-dependent rankings for individual style rules have to be inferred and corroborated by tailor-made corpus-linguistic studies."

        "Without extensive adaptations, off-the-shelf NLP tools that have been trained on corpora of newspaper articles are not adequately equipped to deal with the peculiarities of legal language and legislative texts.",
        "Second, the error modelling for a large number of drafting guidelines requires a concretisation step before automated error detection strategies can be put in place.",
        "The substantial linguistic research that such concretisations require constitutes a core task to be carried out in the development of a style checker for legislative texts."
