        "Leading deception researchers have recently argued that verbal cues are the most promising indicators for detecting deception (Vrij, 2008) while lamenting the fact that the majority of previous research has focused on nonverbal cues.",
        "At the same time, increasing amounts of language are being digitized and stored on computers and the Internet ?",
        "from email, Twitter and online dating profiles to legal testimony and corporate communication.",
        "With the recent advances in natural language processing that have enhanced our ability to analyze language, researchers now have an opportunity to similarly advance our understanding of deception.",
        "One of the crucial components of this enterprise, as recognized by the call for papers for the present workshop, is the need to develop corpora for developing and testing models of deception.",
        "To date there has not been any systematic approach for corpus creation within the deception field.",
        "In the present study, we first provide an overview of traditional approaches for this task (Section 2) and discuss recent deception detection methods that rely on non-gold standard corpora (Section 3).",
        "Section 4 introduces novel approaches for corpus creation that employ crowdsourcing and argues that these have several advantages over traditional and non-gold standard approaches.",
        "Finally, we describe an in-depth case study of how these techniques can be implemented to study deceptive online hotel reviews (Section 5)."

      "text": [
        "The vast majority of studies examining deception employ some form of the sanctioned lie method.",
        "A common example is recruiting participants for a study on deception and randomly assigning them to a lie or truth condition.",
        "A classic example of this kind of procedure is the original study by Ek-man and Friesen (1969), in which nurses were required to watch pleasant or highly disturbing movie clips.",
        "The nurses were instructed to indicate that they were watching a pleasing movie, which required the nurses watching the disturbing clips to lie about their current emotional state.",
        "In another example, Newman et.",
        "al.",
        "(2003) ask",
        "participants about their beliefs concerning a given topic, such as abortion, and then instruct participants to convince a partner that they hold the opposite belief.",
        "Another form of sanctioned deception is to instruct participants to engage in some form of mock crime and then ask them to lie about it.",
        "For example, in one study (Porter and Yuille, 1996), participants were asked to take an item, such as a wallet, from a room and then lie about it afterwards.",
        "The mock crime approach improves the ecological validity of the deception, and makes it the case that the person actually did in fact act a certain way that they then must deny.",
        "The advantages are obvious for these sanctioned lie approaches.",
        "The researcher has large degrees of experimental control over what the participant lies about and when, which allows for careful comparison across the deceptive and non-deceptive accounts.",
        "Another advantage is the relative ease of instructing participants to lie vs. trying to identify actual (but unknown) lies in a dialogue.",
        "The limitations for this approach, however, are also obvious.",
        "In asking participants to lie, the researcher is essentially giving permission to the person to lie.",
        "This should affect the participant's behavior as the lie is being conducted at the behest of a power figure, essentially acting out their deception.",
        "Indeed, a number of scholars have pointed out this problem (Frank and Ek-man, 1997), and have suggested that unless high stakes are employed the paradigm produces data that does not replicate any typical lying situation.",
        "High stakes refers to the potential for punishment if the lie is detected or reward if the lie goes undetected.",
        "Perhaps because of the difficulty in creating high-stakes deception scenarios, to date there are few corpora involving high-stakes lies."

      "heading": "2.2 Unsanctioned Deception",
      "text": [
        "Unsanctioned lies are those that are told without any explicit instruction or permission from the researcher.",
        "These kinds of lies have been collected in a number of ways.",
        "Two related methods for collecting information about unsanctioned lies are diary studies and survey studies.",
        "In diary studies participants are asked on an ongoing basis (e.g., every night) to recall lies that they told over a given period (e.g., a day, a week) (DePaulo et al., 1996; Hancock et al., 2004).",
        "Similarly, recent studies have asked participants in national surveys how often they have lied in the last 24 hours (Serota et al., 2010).",
        "One important feature of these approaches is that the lies have already taken place, and thus they do not share the same limitations as sanctioned lies.",
        "There are several drawbacks, however, especially given the current goal to collect deception corpora.",
        "First, both diary studies and survey approaches require self-reported recall of deception.",
        "Several biases are likely to affect the results, including under-reporting of deception in order to reduce embarrassment and difficult-to-remember deceptions that have occurred over the time period.",
        "More importantly, this kind of approach does not lend itself to collecting the actual language of the lie, for incorporation into a corpus: people have a poor memory for conversation recall (Stafford and Sharkey, 1987).",
        "One method for getting around the memory limitations for natural discourse is to record the discourse and ask participants to later identify any deceptions in their discourse.",
        "For instance, one study (Feldman and Happ, 2002) asked participants to meet another individual and talk for ten minutes.",
        "After the discussion, participants were asked to examine the videotape of the discussion and indicated any times in which they were deceptive.",
        "More recently, others have used the retrospective identification technique on mediated communication, such as SMS, which produces an automatic record of the conversation that can be reviewed for deception (Hancock, 2009).",
        "Because this approach preserves a record that the participant can use to identify the deception, this technique can generate data for linguistic analysis.",
        "However, an important limitation, as with the diary and survey data, is that the researcher must assume that the participant is being truthful about their deception reporting.",
        "The last form of unsanctioned lying involves incentivizing participants to first cheat on a task and to then lie when asked about the cheating be-havior.",
        "Levine et al. (2010) have recently used",
        "this approach, which involved students performing a trivia quiz.",
        "During the quiz, an opportunity to cheat arises where some of the students will take the opportunity.",
        "At this point, they have not yet lied, but, after the quiz is over, all students are asked whether they cheated by an interviewer who does not know if they cheated or not.",
        "While most of the cheaters admit to cheating, a small fraction of the cheaters deny cheating.",
        "This subset of cheating denials represents real deception.",
        "The advantages to this approach are threefold: (1) the deception is unsanctioned, (2) it does not involve self-report, and (3) the deceptions have objective ground-truth.",
        "Unfortunately, these kinds of experiments are extremely effort-intensive given the number of deceptions produced.",
        "Only a tiny fraction of the participants typically end up cheating and subsequently lying about the cheating.",
        "While these techniques have been useful in many psychology experiments, in which assessing deception detection has been the priority rather than corpus creation, they are not very feasible when considering obtaining corpora for large-scale settings, e.g., the web.",
        "Furthermore, the techniques are limited in the kinds of contexts that can be created.",
        "For instance, in many cases, e.g., deliberate posting of fake online reviews, subjects can be both highly incentivized to lie and highly concerned with getting caught.",
        "One could imagine surveying hotel owners as to whether they have ever posted a fake review?but it would seem unlikely that any owner would ever admit to having done so."

        "The proposed characteristics include features based on the number of reviews written, e.g., by first-time reviewers, as well as the review ratings, especially as they compare to other ratings of the same hotel.",
        "Li et al. (2011) study deceptive product reviews found on Epinions.com.",
        "Based on user-provided helpfulness ratings, they first draw a subsample of reviews such that the majority are considered to be unhelpful.",

        "Manual annotation of deception is problematic for a number of reasons.",

        "For example, manual annotations can be expensive to obtain, especially in large-scale settings, e.g., the web.",
        "Most seriously however, is that human ability to detect deception is notoriously poor (Bond and DePaulo, 2006).",

        "More generally, the deceptive reviews should be generated under the same basic guidelines as governs the generation of truthful reviews.",
        "E.g., they should have the same length constraints, the same quality constraints, etc.",
        "Step 1: Identify the set of entities to be covered in the truthful reviews.",
        "In order to define a set of desirable reviews, a master database, provided by the review site itself, is mined to identify the most commented (most popular) entities.",
        "These are a good source of truthful reviews.",
        "In particular, previous work has hypothesized that popular offerings are less likely to be targeted by spam (Jindal and Liu, 2008), and therefore reviews for those entities are less likely to be deceptive?enabling those reviews to later comprise the truthful review corpus.",
        "The review site database typically divides the entity set into subcategories that differ across contexts: in the case of hotel reviews the subcategories might refer to cities, or in the case of doctor reviews subcategories might refer to specialties.",
        "To ensure that enough reviews of the entity can be collected, it may be important to select subcategories that themselves are popular.",
        "The study of Ott et al.",
        "(2011), for example, focused on reviews of hotels in Chicago, IL, gathering positive (i.e., 5-star) reviews for the 20 most popular hotels.",

        "(A link to the website was provided.)",
        "Step 3: Attach appropriate warnings to the crowdsource solicitation.",
        "It is important that warnings are attached to the solicitation to avoid gathering (and paying for) reviews that would invalidate the review set for the research.",
        "For example, because each review should be written by a different person, the warning might disallow coders from performing multiple reviews; forbid any form of plagiarism; require that reviews be ?on topic,?",
        "coherent, etc.",
        "Finally, the prompt may inform the Turker that this exercise is for academic purposes only and will not be posted online, however, if such a notice is presented before the review is written and submitted, the resulting lie may be overly sanctioned.",

        "First, and perhaps most importantly, the deceptions are being solicited in exactly the manner real-world deceptions are initiated.",
        "This is important in that the deception task, though sanctioned, is precisely the same task that a real-world deceiver might use, e.g., to collect fake hotel reviews for themselves.",
        "Second, this approach is extremely cost effective in terms of the time and finances required to create custom deception settings that fit a specific context.",
        "Here we looked at creating fake hotel reviews, but we can easily apply this approach to other types of reviews, including reviews of medical professionals, restaurants, and products."
