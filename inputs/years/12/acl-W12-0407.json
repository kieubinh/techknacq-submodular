        "I will begin with a discussion of how and why the polygraph is used in a screening interview and touch on some of the newer techniques in deception detection using body movements, vocal and verbal behavior that are now being tested.",
        "We'll then look at some of the needs for deception detection and applications on our wish list.",
        "The talk will include cases where the current technology has been good and where it has not."
