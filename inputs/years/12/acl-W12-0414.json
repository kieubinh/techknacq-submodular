        "Deception can occur in many different ways; it is possible to deceive not only about the content of a message, but about its background or origin.",
        "For example, a friendly invitation can become sexual harassment when sent from the wrong person, and very few ransom notes are signed by their authors.",
        "Recent research into stylometry has shown that it is practical to identify authors based on their writing style, but it is equally practical (at present technology) for authors to use a deliberately deceptive style, either obfuscating their own style or mimicking that of another writer, with a strong likelihood of avoiding identification.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the possibility of identifying, not the specific author of a text, but whether or not the author of a text wrote with the (deceptive) intent to disguise their style.",
        "Our results strongly suggest that this deceptive intent can itself be identified with greater reliability than the actual author can be."

        "Stylometric authorship attribution ?",
        "assessing the author of a document by statistical analysis of its contents ?",
        "has its origins in the 19th century (Mendenhall, 1887; de Morgan, 1851), but has experienced tremendous resurgence since the work of (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964) and the beginnings of the corpus revolution.",
        "With the exponential growth of digital-only texts and the increasing need to validate or test the legitimacy of questioned digital documents, this is obviously an area with many potential applications.",
        "The most commonly cited stylometric study is of course that of Mosteller and Wallace (1964), who examined the frequency of appearance of approximately thirty function words within the collection of documents known as The Federalist Papers.",
        "Using a form of Bayesian analysis, they were able to show significant differences among the various authors in their use of these words and hence infer the probabilities that each document had been written by each author ?",
        "i.e. infer authorship.",
        "Another classic in this field is the study of the Oz books by Binongo (2003), where he applied principal component analysis (PCA) to the frequencies of the fifty most frequent words in these books and was able to demonstrate (via the first two principle components) a clear visual separation between the books written by Baum and those written later by Thompson.",
        "Recent surveys of this field (Argamon et al., 2009; Koppel et al., 2005; Rudman, 1998; Koppel et al.,",
        "2009; Juola, 2006; Jockers and Witten, 2010; Sta-matatos, 2009) illustrate many techniques of increasing sophistication and accuracy.",
        "What, however, of the person who doesn't want to be identified?",
        "Chaski (2005) cites several real-world instances where authorship attribution was applied to the task of detecting miscreants, and in one case a murderer.",
        "We assume that these miscreants would have preferred to hide their identities if possible.",
        "On a more positive note, activists who fear a tyrannical government would do well to avoid being identified by the political police.",
        "Intuitively, it seems plausible that one would be able to write ?in a different style,?",
        "although it also seems intuitively plausible that at least part of one's writing style is fixed and immutable (van Halteren et al., 2005) ?",
        "you can't pretend, for example, to a bigger vocabulary than you have, as you can't use words that you don't know.",
        "On the other hand, the long tradition of pastiche and parody suggests that at least some aspects of style can be copied.",
        "It should be noted that this type of ?deception?",
        "is different than what most research project study.",
        "Traditionally, a ?deceptive?",
        "statement occurs when a speaker or writer offers an untruth; we instead suggest that another form of ?deception?",
        "can occur when a speaker or writer offers a statement that he or she does not want to be identified with.",
        "This statement may be true (a whistle-blower identifying a problem, but not wanting to risk being fired) or false (a criminal writing a false confession to incriminate someone else) ?",
        "the key deception being the identity of the author.",
        "There is little research on the success of ?deceptive style?",
        "and what little there is should lend hope to activists and whistleblowers.",
        "A team of Drexel researchers (Brennan and Greenstadt, 2009; Afroz et al., 2012) developed a small corpus of deceptive writing (described in detail later), but were unable to find any methods to pierce the deception.",
        "Larger scale analyses (Juola and Vescovi, 2010; Juola and Vescovi, 2011) similarly failed.",
        "?",
        "[N]o method [out of more than 1000 tested] was able to perform ?significantly?",
        "above chance at the standard 0.05 level.. .",

        "observe that, yes, there is a confirmed problem here.",
        "Although these analyses performed (on average) above chance, they did not do so by robust margins, and there is enough variance in individual performance that we cannot claim even to have ?significant?",
        "improvement.?",
        "In light of these results, the Drexel team have proposed and developed a tool [?Anonymouth?, (Afroz and Brennan, 2011; Perlroth, 2012)] that provides a more formal and systematic method of disguising their writing style.",
        "Based in part on the JGAAP tool (Juola et al., 2009; Juola, 2006), this system allows would-be activists to see what aspects of their linguistic fingerprints are more obvious in a document, and guides these same activists to make changes to neutralize their personal style, or even to assume a specific other's style.",
        "In some sense, Anonymouth is the ?evil twin?",
        "countermeasure to JGAAP ?",
        "while JGAAP detects style, Anonymouth in theory renders style indetectable.",
        "Does it work?",
        "The tool is still too new for substantial testing, but we assume based on the earlier work that it will still be difficult to detect the original author under the deception.",
        "However, it may be possible to detect the act of deception itself.",
        "As will be seen in the following sections, standard stylometric tools themselves can do that."

        "essays have themselves a stable style.",
        "JGAAP itself (Juola, 2006) follows a standard model for statistical authorship attribution.",
        "Documents are preprocessed (?canonicized?)",
        "to eliminate distracting or uninformative variation (for example, the length of a printed line is set by the editor, not the author, so ?normalizing whites-pace?",
        "removes some editorial distraction).",
        "Following this, they are broken up into individual events which are subject to some form of statistical analysis and classification.",

        "capital letters at the beginning of a sentence), and normalize whitespace as described above.",
        "Binongo then broke the books up into individual words and selected only the top fifty most common words as his events of interest.",

        "The B/G corpus (as published) collects the writings of twelve people, with approximately ten essays (totaling about 5000 words) per person.",
        "In addition, it has twelve passages from The Road by the professional author Cormac McCarthy.",
        "This establishes a baseline of 126 essays of ?normal?",
        "writing, writing where there is no attempt to disguise style (and hence no deception).",

        "(a so-called ?obfuscation?",
        "), and another in the style of Cormac McCarthy as expressed in The Road (?imitation?).",

        "writing where the writer is attempting to conceal their style.",
        "Of the twelve (thirteen including McCarthy) writers in the sample, we used nine (plus McCarthy) as training data, labeling all instances of the writer using their own style as ?HONEST?",
        "and all instances of obfuscation/imitation as ?DECEPTIVE.?",

        "?(!)?",

        "?her?",
        "and ?ere?).",

        "We thus have the highly surprising result that, while identifying the specific author may be difficult, uncovering the mere fact that the author",
        "is concerned about being identified is relatively easy.",
        "This of course parallels the rather commonplace situation in detective fiction where the fact that the criminal has wiped the fingerprints off the murder weapon is both easy to learn and highly significant, even if the criminal's actual identity must wait five more chapters for the big reveal.",
        "Similarly, it appears to be fairly easy to detect the attempt to wipe one's authorial ?fingerprints?",
        "off of the writing.",

        "(or any of the other test subjects) attempted to write in the style of Cormac McCarthy, the result was actually closer to a third party's attempt to write deceptively than it was to McCarthy's writing himself.",
        "In the specific case of ?Andrew?s?",
        "imitative writing, all six of the six closest samples were of deceptive writing, suggesting that ?deceptive writing?",
        "is itself a recognizable style.",
        "Further investigation is clearly required into the characteristics of the style of deception.",

        "is a recognizable and distinct style from McCarthy?s, but also from ?obfuscated style.?",
        "There may be one or several ?obfuscated styles.?",
        "It is not clear from this study what the characteristics of this style are, and in fact, the inability of JGAAP (and JGAAP's distance-based measures in particular) to produce explanations for what are evidently clear-cut categorizations is one of the major weaknesses of the JGAAP system as currently envisioned.",
