        "Other approaches used supervised mechanisms for OCR error correction, such as: statistical language models (Nagata, 1996; Zhuang et al., 2004; Magdy and Darwish, 2006), noisy channel model (Kolak and Resnik, 2002).",

        "This issue will affect the algorithm implemented in VOSE utilizing the contexts to predict the potential replacements.",
        "VOSE can handle such errors to limited extent.",
        "Merging Cases (Category 2) In this case, two or more erroneous syllables are accidentally merged.",
        "Currently, VOSE cannot",
        "handle such cases.",
        "We aim to investigate this in our future work.",
        "(both in English, Vietnamese) (Category 3) Abbreviations or proper nouns or numbers are unknown (for VOSE) because they do not appear in ngram extraction data.",
        "If VOSE marks them as errors, it could not correct them properly.",

        "cases in which punctuation marks (e.g. comma, dot, dash, .",
        ".",
        ". )",
        "are accidentally added between two different syllable or within one syllable.",

        "?",
        "cases relating to semantics in Vietnamese.",
        "?",
        "cases where one Vietnamese syllable that is changed incorrectly becomes an English word.",
        "Lost Cases (Category 5) This case happens when a syllable which is accidentally lost most of its characters or too short becomes extremely hard to correct.",
        "Additionally, we conducted to observe the distribution of the above categories (Figure 3).",
        "As can be seen, Category 4 dominates more than 70% cases that VOSE has troubles for detection & correction."

        "In this paper, we?ve proposed & developed a new approach for spell checking task (both detection and correction) for Vietnamese OCR-scanned text documents.",

        "to integrate the prior language-specific knowledge easily.",
        "Based on the evaluation on a real dataset, the system currently offers an acceptable performance (best result: detection accuracy 86%, correction accuracy 71%).",
        "With just an amount of small n-gram extraction data, the obtained result is very promising.",
        "Also, the detailed error analysis in previous section reveals that cases that current system VOSE cannot solve are extremely hard, referring to the problem of semantics-related ambiguity in Vietnamese language.",
        "Further remarkable point of proposed approach is that it can perform the detection & correction processes in real-time manner.",
        "Future works include some directions.",
        "First, we should crawl and add more textual data for n-gram extraction to improve the performance of current system.",
        "More data VOSE has, more accurate it performs.",
        "Second, we should investigate more on categories (as discussed earlier) that VOSE could not resolve well.",
        "Last, we also adapt this work for another language (like English) to assess the generalization and efficiency of proposed approach."
