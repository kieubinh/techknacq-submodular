        "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an information extraction (IE) task that aims at extracting and categorizing specific entities (proper names or dedicated linguistic units as time expressions, amounts, etc.)",
        "in texts.",
        "These texts can be produced in diverse conditions.",
        "In particular, they may correspond to either electronic written documents (Marsh & Perzanowski, 1998) or more recently speech transcripts provided by a human expert or an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system (Galliano et al., 2009).",
        "The recognized entities may later be used by higher-level tasks for different purposes such as Information Retrieval or Open-Domain Question-Answering (Voorhees & Harman, 2000).",
        "While NER is often considered as quite a simple task, there is still room for improvement when it is confronted to difficult contexts.",
        "For instance, NER systems may have to cope with noisy data such as word sequences containing speech recognition errors in ASR.",
        "In addition, NER is no more circumscribed to proper names, but may also involve common nouns (e.g., ?the judge?)",
        "or complex multi-word expressions (e.g. ?the Computer Science department of the New York University?).",
        "These complementary needs for robust and detailed processing explain that knowledge-based and data-driven approaches remain equally competitive on NER tasks as shown by numerous evaluation campaigns.",
        "For instance, the French-speaking Ester2 evaluation campaign on radio broadcasts (Galliano et al., 2009) has shown that knowledge-based approaches outperformed data-driven ones on manual transcriptions while a system based on Conditional Random Fields (CRFs, participant LIA) is ranked first on noisy ASR transcripts.",
        "This is why the development of hybrid systems has been investigated by the NER community.",
        "In this paper, we present a strategy of hybridization benefiting from features produced by a knowledge-based system (CasEN) and a data-driven pattern extractor (mineXtract).",
        "CasEN has been manually implemented based on finite-state transducers.",
        "Such a hand-crafted system requires substantial efforts to be adapted to dedicated tasks.",
        "We developed mineXtract, a text-mining system that automatically extracts informative rules, based on hierarchical sequential pattern mining.",
        "Both implement processings that are context-aware and use lexicons.",
        "Finally, to recognize NEs, we propose mStruct, a light multi-purpose automatic annotator, parameterized using logistic regression over available features.",
        "It takes into account features provided by lower-level systems and annotation scheme constraints to output a valid annotation maximizing likelihood.",
        "Our experiments show that the resulting hybrid system outperforms standalone systems and reaches performances comparable to a baseline hybrid CRF system.",
