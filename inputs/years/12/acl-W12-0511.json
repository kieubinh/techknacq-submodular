        "Digital versions of bilingual dictionaries often have errors that need to be fixed.",
        "For example, Figures 1 through 5 show an example of an error that occurred in one of our development dictionaries and how the error should be corrected.",
        "Figure 1 shows the entry for the word ?turfah?",
        "as it appeared in the original print copy of (Qureshi and Haq, 1991).",
        "We see this word has three senses with slightly different meanings.",
        "The third sense is ?rare?.",
        "In the original digitized XML version of (Qureshi and Haq, 1991) depicted in Figure 2, this was misrepresented as not being the meaning",
        "of ?turfah?",
        "but instead being a usage note that frequency of use of the third sense was rare.",
        "Figure 3 shows the tree corresponding to this XML representation.",
        "The corrected digital XML representation is depicted in Figure 4 and the corresponding corrected tree is shown in Figure 5.",
        "Zajic et al. (2011) presented a method for repairing a digital dictionary in an XML format using a dictionary markup language called DML.",
        "It remains time-consuming and error-prone however to have a human read through and manually correct a digital version of a dictionary, even with languages such as DML available.",
        "We therefore investigate automating the detection of errors.",
        "We investigate the use of three individual methods.",
        "The first is a supervised feature-based method trained using SVMs (Support Vector Machines).",
        "The second is a language-modeling",
        "method that replicates the method presented in (Rodrigues et al., 2011).",
        "The third is a simple rule inference method.",
        "The three individual methods have different performances.",
        "So we investigate how we can combine the methods most effectively.",
        "We experiment with majority vote, score combination, and random forest methods and find that random forest combinations work the best.",
        "For many dictionaries, training data will not be available in large quantities a priori and therefore methods that require only small amounts of training data are desirable.",
        "Interestingly, for automatically detecting errors in dictionaries, we find that the unsupervised methods have performance that rivals that of the supervised feature-based method trained using SVMs.",
        "Moreover, when we combine methods using the random forest method, the combination of unsupervised methods works better than the supervised method in isolation and almost as well as the combination of all available methods.",
        "A potential drawback of using the random forest combination method however is that it requires training data.",
        "We investigated how much training data is needed and find that the amount of training data required is modest.",
        "Furthermore, by selecting the training data to be labeled with the use of specific selection methods reminiscent of active learning, it may be possible to train the random forest system combination method with even less data without sacrificing performance.",

        "Classifier combination techniques can be broadly classified into two categories: mathematical and behavioral (Tulyakov et al., 2008).",
        "In the first category, functions or rules combine normalized classifier scores from individual classifiers.",
        "Examples of techniques in this category include Majority Voting (Lam and Suen, 1997), as well as simple score combination rules such as: sum rule, min rule, max rule and product rule (Kittler et al., 1998; Ross and Jain, 2003; Jain et al., 2005).",
        "In the second category, the output of individual classifiers are combined to form a feature vector as",
        "the input to a generic classifier such as classification trees (P. and Chollet, 1999; Ross and Jain, 2003) or the k-nearest neighbors classifier (P. and Chollet, 1999).",
        "Our method falls into the second category, where we use a random forest for system combination.",
        "The random forest method is described in (Breiman, 2001).",
        "It is an ensemble classifier consisting of a collection of decision trees (called a random forest) and the output of the random forest is the mode of the classes output by the individual trees.",
        "Each single tree is trained as follows: 1) a random set of samples from the initial training set is selected as a training set and 2) at each node of the tree, a random subset of the features is selected, and the locally optimal split is based on only this feature subset.",
        "The tree is fully grown without pruning.",
        "Ma et al. (2005) used random forests for combining scores of several biometric devices for identity verification and have shown encouraging results.",
        "They use all fully supervised methods.",
        "In contrast, we explore minimizing the amount of training data needed to train a random forest of unsupervised methods.",
        "The use of active learning in order to reduce training data requirements without sacrificing model performance has been reported on extensively in the literature (e.g., (Seung et al., 1992; Cohn et al., 1994; Lewis and Gale, 1994; Cohn et al., 1996; Freund et al., 1997)).",
        "When training our random forest combination of individual methods that are themselves unsupervised, we explore how to select the data so that only small amounts of training data are needed because for many dictionaries, gathering training data may be expensive and labor-intensive."

        "Before we discuss our approaches for combining systems, we briefly explain the three individual systems that form the foundation of our combined system.",
        "First, we use a supervised approach where we train a model using SVMlight (Joachims, 1999) with a linear kernel and default regularization parameters.",
        "We use a depth first traversal of the XML tree and use unigrams and bigrams of the tags that occur as features for each subtree to make a classification decision.",

        "The first unsupervised approach learns rules for",
        "when to classify nodes as errors or not.",
        "The rule-based method computes an anomaly score based on the probability of subtree structures.",
        "Given a structure A and its probability P(A), the event that A occurs has anomaly score 1-P(A) and the event that A does not occur has anomaly score",
        "P(A).",
        "The basic idea is if a certain structure happens rarely, i.e. P(A) is very small, then the occurrence of A should have a high anomaly score.",
        "On the other hand, if A occurs frequently, then the absence of A indicates anomaly.",
        "To obtain the anomaly score of a tree, we simply take the maximal scores of all events induced by subtrees within this tree.",
        "The second unsupervised approach uses a reimplementation of the language modeling method described in (Rodrigues et al., 2011).",
        "Briefly, this methods works by calculating the probability a flattened XML branch can occur, given a probability model trained on the XML branches from the original dictionary.",
        "We used (Stolcke, 2002) to generate bigram models using Good Turing smoothing and Katz back off, and evaluated the log probability of the XML branches, ranking the likelihood.",
        "The first 1000 branches were submitted to the hybrid system marked as an error, and the remaining were submitted as a non-error.",

        "We investigate three methods for combining the three individual methods.",
        "As a baseline, we investigate simple majority vote.",
        "This method takes the classification decisions of the three methods and assigns the final classification as the classification that the majority of the methods predicted.",
        "A drawback of majority vote is that it does not weight the votes at all.",
        "However, it might make sense to weight the votes according to factors such as the strength of the classification score.",
        "For example, all of our classifiers make binary decisions but output scores that are indicative of the confidence of their classifications.",
        "Therefore we also explore a score combination method that considers these scores.",
        "Since measures from the different systems are in different ranges, we normalize these measurements before combining them (Jain et al., 2005).",
        "We use z-score which com",
        "putes the arithmetic mean and standard deviation of the given data for score normalization.",
        "We then take the summation of normalized measures as the final measure.",
        "Classification is performed by thresholding this final measure.1 Another approach would be to weight them by the performance level of the various constituent classifiers in the ensemble.",
        "Weighting based on performance level of the individual classifiers is difficult because it would require extra labeled data to estimate the various performance levels.",
        "It is not clear how to translate the different performance estimates into weights, or how to have those weights interact with weights based on strengths of classification.",
        "Therefore, we did not weigh based on performance level explicitly.",
        "We believe that our third combination method, the use of random forests, implicitly captures weighting based on performance level and strengths of classifications.",
        "Our random forest approach uses three features, one for each of the individual systems we use.",
        "With random forests, strengths of classification are taken into account because they form the values of the three features we use.",
        "In addition, the performance level is taken into account because the training data used to train the decision trees that form the forest help to guide binning of the feature values into appropriate ranges where classification decisions are made correctly.",

        "We investigated how the amount of training data affects the performance, and found that a small amount of labeled data is all that the random forest needs in order to be successful.",
        "Moreover, although this requires further exploration, there is weak evidence that the size of the labeled data can potentially be reduced by choosing it carefully from the region that is expected to be most errorful.",

        "An examination of examples that are marked as being errors in our ground truth but that were not detected to be errors by any of our systems suggests that some examples are decided on the basis of features not yet considered by any system.",

        "Automatic systems detected that the first FORM was an error, however did not mark the second FORM as an error whereas our ground truth marked both as errors.",
        "Examination of false negatives also revealed cases where the systems were correct that there was no error but our ground truth wrongly indicated that there was an error.",
        "These were due to our semi-automated method for producing ground truth that considers elements mentioned in DML commands to be errors.",
        "We discovered instances in which merely mentioning an element in a DML command does not imply that the element is an error.",
        "These cases are useful for making refinements to how ground truth is generated from DML commands.",
        "Examination of false positives revealed two categories.",
        "One was where the element is indeed an error but was not marked as an element in our ground truth because it was part of a larger error",

        "The other category was where there were actual errors that the dictionary editors didn't repair with DML but that should have been repaired.",
