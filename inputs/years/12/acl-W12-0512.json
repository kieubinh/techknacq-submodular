        "Models have been trained using 5, 10, 15 and 20 answers for each system.",
        "For the evaluation, we used 147 factoid questions used in the 2010 Quaero4 evaluation campaign.",
        "The document collection is made of 500,000 Web pages5.",
        "We used the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) as it is a usual metric in Question-Answering on the first five candidate answers.",
        "The MRR is the average of the reciprocal ranks of all considered answers.",

        "The baseline results, provided by each of the three systems, are presented in Table 2.",
        "QAVAL and RITEL-S have quite similar results which are higher than those obtained by the RITEL-P system.",
        "We can observe that, within the 20 top ranks, 38% of the questions have an answer given by all the systems, 76 % by at least 2 systems and 21% receive no correct answers.",
        "The best possible result that could be obtained by a perfect fusion method is also indicated in this table (0.79 of MRR and 79% for top-1).",
        "Such a method would lead to rank first each correct answer found by at least a system.",

        "It ranks 98 % of the correct answers given by the 3 systems in top 5 ranks.",
        "It also ranks better correct answers given by 2 systems (60% are ranked in the top 5 ranks versus about 48 % with the two other methods).",
        "The rank-based method is globally reliable for selecting correct answers in the top 5 ranks.",
        "This behavior is consistent with the fact that our QA systems, when they found a correct answer, generally rank it in first positions.",
        "Some correct answers given by only one system remain in the first position, and about 10% of them remain in the top 5 ranks and are not superseded by common wrong answers.",
        "However the major part of these correct single-system answers are discarded after the 5 first ranks (39% of them by the SVM method, 45% by the rank-based method and 53% by the hybrid method).",
        "In that case, a ML method is a better solution for deciding, however an improvement would be possible only if other features could be found for a better characterization of a correct answer, or maybe by enlarging the training base.",
        "According to these results, we also can expect that with more QA systems, a fusion approach would be more effective."
