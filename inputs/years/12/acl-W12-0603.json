        "The social media platform of Twitter makes available a plethora of data to probe the communicative act of people in a social network woven by interesting events, people, topics, etc.",
        "Communicative acts such as disseminating information, asking questions, or expressing feelings all fall in the purview of ?speech act?, a long established area in pragmatics (Austin 1962).",
        "The automatic recognition of speech act in tons of tweets has both theoretical and practical appeal.",
        "Practically, it helps tweeters to find topics to read or tweet about based on speech act compositions.",
        "Theoretically, it introduces a new dimension to study social media content as well as providing real-life data to validate or falsify claims in the speech act theory.",
        "Different taxonomies of speech act have been proposed by linguists and computational linguists, ranging from a few to over a hundred types.",
        "In this work, we adopt the 5 types of speech act used in our previous work (Zhang et al.",
        "2011), which are in turn inherited from (Searle 1975): statement, question, suggestion, comment, and miscellaneous.",
        "Our choice is based on the fact that unlike face-to-face communication, twittering is more in a ?broadcasting?",
        "style than on a personal basis.",
        "Statement and comment, which are usually intended to make one's knowledge, thought, and sentiment known, thus befit Twitter's communicative style.",
        "Question and suggestion on Twitter are usually targeted at other tweeters in general or one's followers.",
        "More interpersonal speech acts such as ?threat?",
        "or ?thank?",
        "as well as rare speech acts in Twitter (Searle's (1975) ?commissives?",
        "and ?declaratives?)",
        "are relegated to ?miscellaneous?.",
        "Some examples from our experimental datasets are provided in Table 1.",
        "Assuming one tweet demonstrates only one speech act, the automatic recognition of those speech act types in Twitter is a multi-class classification task.",
        "We concede that this assumption may not always hold in real situations.",
        "But given the short length of tweets, multi-speech act tweets are rare and we find this simplifying assumption effective in reducing the complexity of our problem.",
        "A major problem with this task is the deficiency of training data.",
        "Tweeters as well as face-to-face interlocutors do not often identify their speech acts; human annotation is costly and time-consuming.",
        "Although our previous research (Zhang et al. 2011) sheds light on the preparation of training data, it did not adequately address this problem.",
        "Our contribution in this work is to directly address the problem of training data deficiency by using two well-known semi-supervised learning techniques that leverage the relationship between a small seed of training data and a large body of unlabeled data: transductive SVM and graph-based label propagation.",
        "The empirical results show that the knowledge about unlabeled data provides promising solutions to the data deficiency problem, and that transductive SVM is more competent for our task.",
        "Our exploration with different training/unlabeled data ratios for three major Twitter categories and a mixed-type category provides solid evidential support for future research.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 reviews works related to speech act recognition and semi-supervised learning; Section 3 briefly discusses supervised learning of speech act types developed in our earlier work and complementing the previous findings with learning curves.",
        "The technical details of semi-supervised learning are presented in Section 4.",
        "Then we report and discuss the results of our experiments in Section 5.",

        "The automatic recognition of speech act, also known as ?dialogue act?, has attracted sustained interest in computational linguistics and speech technology for over a decade (Searle 1975; Stolcke et al. 2000).",
        "A few annotated corpora such as Switchboard-DAMSL (Jurafsky et al. 1997) and Meeting Recorder Dialog Act (Dhillon et al. 2004) are widely used, with data transcribed from telephone or face-to-face conversation.",
        "Prior to the flourish of microblogging services such as Twitter, speech act recognition has been extended to electronic media such as email and discussion forum (Cohen et al. 2004; Feng et al. 2006) in order to study the behavior of email or message senders.",
        "The annotated corpora for ordinary verbal communications and the methods developed for email, or discussion forum cannot be directly used for our task because Twitter text has a distinctive Netspeak style that is situated between speech and text but resembles neither (Crystal 2006, 2011).",
        "Compared with email or forum post, it is rife with linguistic noises such as spelling mistakes, random coinages, mixed use of letters and symbols.",
        "Speech act recognition in Twitter is a fairly new task.",
        "In our pioneering work (Zhang et al. 2011), we show that Twitter text normalization is unnecessary and even counterproductive for this task.",
        "More importantly, we propose a set of useful features and draw empirical conclusion about the scope of this task, such as recognizing speech act on the coarse-grade category level works as well as on the fine-grade topic level.",
        "In this work, we continue to adopt this framework including other learning details (speech act types and feature selection for tweets), but the new quest starts where the old one left: tackling insufficient training data.",
        "As in many practical applications, sufficient annotated data are hard to obtain.",
        "Therefore, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning methods are actively pursued.",
        "While unsupervised sentence classification is rule-based and domain-dependent (Deshpande et al. 2010), semi-supervised methods that both alleviate the data deficiency problem and leverage the power of state-of-the-art classifiers hold more promises for different domains (Medlock and Briscoe 2007; Erkan et al. 2007).",
        "In the machine learning literature, a classic semi-supervised learning scheme is proposed by Yarowsky (1995), which is a classical self-teaching process that makes no use of labeled data before they are classified.",
        "More theoretical analyses are made by (Culp and Michailidis 2007) and (Haffari and Sarkar 2007).",
        "Transductive SVM (Joachims 1999) extends the state-of-the-art inductive SVM by explicitly considering the relationship between labeled and unlabeled data.",
        "The graph-based label propagation model (Zhu et al. 2003; Zhou et al. 2004) using a harmonic function also accommodates the knowledge about unlabeled data.",
        "We will adapt both of them to our multi-class classification task.",
        "Jeong et al. (2009) report a semi-supervised approach to classifying speech acts in emails and online forums.",
        "But their subtree-based method is not applicable to our task because Twitter's noisy textual quality cannot be found in the much cleaner email or forum texts."

        "Most instances are predicted as either Sta or Mis.",
        "The wrong prediction as Mis cannot be explained by imbalance of training data.",
        "Rather, it is due to the fact that the single-class scores for Mis after smoothing on the graph are generally higher than those for Que, Sug, or Com.",
        "In other words, the graph-based method is highly sensitive to class differences when multi-class prediction is converted from single-class predictions on a scheme like one-vs-all.",

        "1) Semi-supervised learning approaches, especially transductive SVM, perform comparably to supervised learning approaches, such as inductive SVM, with considerably less training data and lower training/test ratio.",
        "Increasing training data cannot improve performance proportionately.",
        "2) Transductive SVM proves to be more effective than graph-based label propagation for our task.",
        "The performance of the latter is hurt by two factors: a) the inappropriate assumption about similar tweets having the same speech act and b) its vulnerability to class differences under the one-vs-all multi-class conversion scheme.",
        "3) For supervised learning as well as semi-supervised learning for multi-class classification, training data imbalance poses no lesser threat than training data deficiency."

        "Speech act recognition in Twitter facilitates content-based user behavior study.",
        "Realizing that it is obsessed with insufficient training data, we start where previous research left.",
        "We are not aware of previous study of semi-supervised learning of speech acts in Twitter and in this paper we contribute to scalable speech act recognition by drawing conclusions from extensive experiments.",
        "Specifically, we 1) extend the work of (Zhang et al. 2011) by establishing the practicality of semi-supervised learning that leverages the knowledge of unlabeled data as a promising solution to insufficient training data; 2) show that transductive SVM is more effective than graph-based label propagation for our problem, which aptly extends the maximal margin approach to unlabeled data and is more amenable to the multi-class scenario; 3) provide detailed empirical evidences of multi-class and single-class results, which can inform future extensions in this direction and design of practical systems.",
        "At this stage, we are not sure whether the one-vs-all scheme is a bottleneck to one class-oriented classifiers (it appears to be so for the graph-based method).",
        "Therefore we will next explore other multi-class conversion schemes and also consider semi-supervised learning using inherently multi-class classifiers such as Na?ve Bayes or Decision Tree.",
        "In the future, we will also explore unsupervised approaches to recognizing speech acts in Twitter."
