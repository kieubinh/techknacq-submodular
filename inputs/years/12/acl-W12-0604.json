        "With the ever increasing popularity of blogging grows the need of finding ways for better organizing the blogosphere.",
        "Besides identifying SPAM from legitimate blogs, one promising idea is to classify blog posts into topics such as travel, sports, religion, and so on, which could lead to better ways of exploring the blogosphere.",
        "Besides navigation, blog classification can be useful as a data preprocessing step before other forms of analysis can be done: for example companies can view the perception and reception of products, movies, books and more based on opinions in blogs of different segments.",
        "We approach the problem by using machine learning.",
        "In particular, in the development of a learning-based classifier, two crucial tasks are the choice of the features and the building of training data.",
        "We adopt a novel approach when selecting features: we use an off-the-shelf Named Entity Recognition (NER) tool to identify entities in the text.",
        "Our hypothesis is that one can detect the topic of a post by focusing on the entities discussed in the post.",
        "Previous text classification tools use the entire vocabulary as potential features, which is a superset of our feature set.",
        "Our results show that despite using a smaller feature set, our method can achieve very high accuracy.",
        "Obtaining training data is a challenge for most learning tools, as it often involves manual inspection of hundreds or thousands of examples.",
        "We address this by using distant supervision, where a separate dataset is used to obtain training data for the classifier.",
        "The distant dataset used here is Freebase1, which is an open online database, along with related Wikipedia articles.",
        "The classes in our tests are domains in Freebase, which are defined by their curators.",
        "Summary of Results.",
        "For our evaluation, we use a large sample of blog posts from a public snapshot of the blogosphere, collected around 2008.",
        "These posts are manually labeled by volunteers (undergraduate students in Computing Science), and used as the ground-truth test data.",
        "Our results indicate that training a classifier relying on named entities using Freebase and Wikipedia, can achieve high accuracy levels on manually annotated data.",
        "We also identify some potential problems related to selecting the categories to be used in the classification.",
        "Overall, our results indicate that robust classifiers are possible using off-the-shelf tools and freely available",

        "Our work is related to topic identification techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) (Steyvers and Griffiths, 2007).",
        "These techniques infer possible topic classes, and use unsupervised learning (clustering) approaches.",
        "In contrast, our technique allows the specification of classes (topics) of interest and attempts to classify text within those classes only.",
        "Next we discuss two other lines of work more closely related to ours.",
        "Blog classification.",
        "There have been few attempts at classifying blog posts by topic.",
        "Most previous methods focus on classification of the authors and the sentiment of the posts.",
        "Ikeda et al. (2008) discussed the classification of blog authors by gender and age.",
        "They use a semi-supervised technique and look at the blogs in groups of two or more.",
        "These groupings are based on which are relatively similar and relatively different.",
        "They assume that multiple entries from the same author are more similar to each other than to posts from other blogs, and use this to train the classifier.",
        "The classifier they use is support vector machines, and the bag-of-words feature representation.",
        "Thus, they consider all unique words in their classification.",
        "They find their methods to be 70-95% accurate on age classification, depending on the particular age class (i.e. the 20s vs the 30s class is more difficult to distinguish than the 20s vs the 50s) and up to 91% accurate on gender identification.",
        "This is quite different than the approach presented here, as we are examining topic classification.",
        "Yang et al. (2007) consider the sentiment (positive or negative) analysis of blog posts.",
        "Their classifier is trained at the sentence level and applied to the entire document.",
        "They use emoticons to first create training data and then use support vector machines and conditional random fields in the actual classification.",
        "They use individual words as features and find that conditional random fields outperform support vector machines.",
        "This paper works both with blog posts and distance learning based on the emoticons, however this type of distant supervision is slightly different than our approach.",
        "It may also be referred to as using weakly labeled data.",
        "Elgersma and de Rijke (2008) classify blogs as personal vs non-personal.",
        "The authors define personal blogs as diary or journal, presenting personal accounts of daily life and intimate thoughts and feelings.",
        "They use the frequency of words more often used in personal blogs versus those more frequently used in general blogs, pronouns, in-links, out-links and hosts as the features for the blogs.",
        "They then perform supervised training on the data using a set of 152 manually labeled blogs to train their classifier.",
        "The results show that the decision tree method produced the highest accuracy at about 90% (Elgersma and de Rijke, 2008).",
        "A work which looks at true topic classification of blogs, as is being done here, is that of Hashimoto and Kurohashi (2008), who use a domain dictionary to classify blog posts without machine learning (i.e., using a rule-based system).",
        "They use keywords for each domain, or category as the basis for classification.",
        "They then create a score of a blog post based on the number of keywords from each domain; the domain with the highest count becomes the category for that post.",
        "They also expand the keywords in their domain by adding new words on the fly.",
        "This is done by taking an unknown word (one that does not currently exist in a domain) and attempting to categorize it using its online search results and/or Wikipedia article.",
        "They attempt to classify the results or article and then, in turn, classify the word.",
        "They find their classification method to be up to 99% accurate.",
        "This idea can be related to the use of Freebase as the domain dictionary in the current problem, but will be expanded to include machine learning techniques, which these authors avoid.",
        "Distant supervision.",
        "Distant supervision is a relatively new idea in the field of machine learning.",
        "The term was first introduced by Mintz et al.",
        "(2009) in 2009 in their paper on relation extraction.",
        "The idea is to use facts in Freebase to obtain training data (i.e., provide distant supervision), based on the premise that if a pair of entities that have a relation in Freebase, it will likely be expressed in some way in a new context.",
        "They found their approach to be about 66-69% accurate on large amounts of data.",
        "Although the goal of their work (namely, extracting relations from the text) was different from ours, the use of Freebase and entities is directly related to the work",
        "presented here.",
        "Go et al. (Go et al., 2009) use distant supervision to label the sentiment associated with Twitter posts.",
        "They use tweets containing emoticons to label the training data, as follows.",
        "If a tweet contains a :) or an : ( then it is considered to have a positive or a negative sentiment.",
        "Those tweets with multiple emoticons were discarded.",
        "Then emoticons themselves are removed from all data (to avoid them being used as features), and the labeled data is used to train the classifier.",
        "They found their approach to be around 78-83% accurate using several different machine learning techniques (Go et al., 2009).",
        "The authors do not discuss their feature representations in detail, but make use of both unigrams and bigrams.",
        "Phan et al. (Phan et al., 2008) consider using a universal data set to train a classifier for web data similar to blogs .",
        "This idea is very similar to the concept of distant supervision.",
        "They consider Wikipedia and MEDLINE, as universal data sets, and they use the maximum entropy as their classifier.",
        "They apply their methods to two problems, topic clustering of web search results and disease classification for medical abstracts; they report accuracy levels around 80%."

        "Another category with relatively less counts is celebrities, which can also be explained by the lower document count (1,605 available articles relating to this topic in Freebase).",

        "Articles in the travel topic can include information about many things that can be done and seen around the world, such as the culinary traits of the places being discussed and the celebrities that visited them, or the religious figures that represent them.",
        "Thus, one would expect some overlap among the named entities relating to these less well-defined classes.",
        "These concepts tie easily into the various other topic categories we have considered and help to explain why misclassification was higher for these cases.",
        "We also observed that with the NBM results, in all three variations of the multi-class experiments, there was a fairly consistent trade-off between recall and precision for the celebrities class.",
        "The erroneous classification of posts into celebrities could be explained in a similar way to those in food&travel.",
        "The fact that celebrities can exist in sports, politics, and religion means that many of the posts may fit into two or more classes and explains the errors.",
        "The best way to explore this further would be to do multiple class labels per post rather than just choosing a single label.",

        "Recall that the need for the class other is mostly to test whether the classifier can handle ?noise?",
        "(blogs which are too general to be classified).",
        "With this in mind, the trend in Figure 1 (increasing classification performance as classes are removed) is encouraging, as it indicates that more focused classes (e.g., religion and sports) can actually be separated well by a classifier using distant supervision, even in the presence of less well-defined classes.",

        "Reducing the feature contributes to increasing the scalability of topic classification, compared to the state of the art which is to process the entire vocabulary.",
        "The second observation is that distant supervision is effective in obtaining training data: By using Freebase and Wikipedia to obtain training data for standard machine learning classifiers, accuracy as high as mid-90% were achieved on our binary classification task, and around 70% for the multi-class task.",
        "Our tests confirmed the superiority of NBM for text classification tasks, which had been observed before.",
        "Moreover, our test also showed that this superior performance is very robust across a variety of settings.",
        "Our results also show that it is important to consider topics carefully, as there can be considerable overlap in many general classes",
        "and this can cause misclassification.",
        "Obviously, such overlap is inevitable?and indeed expecting that a single topic can be found for each post can be viewed as a restriction.",
        "The most straightforward way to overcome this is by allowing multiple class labels per sample, rather than forcing a single classification.",
        "Given the difficulty of the task, we believe our results are a clear indication that distant supervision is a very promising option for topic classification of social media content.",
        "Future Work.",
        "One immediate avenue for future work is understanding whether there are techniques that can separate the classes with high overlap, such as celebrities, food&drinks and travel.",
        "However, it is very hard even for humans to separate these classes, so it is not clear what level of accuracy can be achieved.",
        "Another option is to examine additional features which could improve the accuracy of the classifier without drastically increasing the costs.",
        "Features of the blog posts such as link structure and post length, which we disregarded, may improve classification.",
        "Moreover, one could use unsupervised methods to find relations between the named entities and exploit those, e.g., for bootstrapping.",
        "A similar idea would be to exploit dependencies among relational terms involving entities, which could easily be done on blogs and the Wikipedia articles.",
        "Topic selection is another area for future work.",
        "Our selection of topics was very general and based on Freebase domains, but a more detailed study of how to select more specific topics would be worthwhile.",
