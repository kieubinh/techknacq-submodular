        "Evolutionary change happens when structures are copied, the copying is inexact, and the survival of copies is uncertain.",

        "Often evolutionary change leaves little or no trace, except for those copies which are present at the moment.",
        "In these cases, determining the evolutionary history of a family of structures involves comparing surviving copies and making inferences from where they correspond and where they differ.",
        "Language is, for the most part, one of those cases.",
        "Most languages have not had a writing system until recently, and so their history has left no direct trace.",
        "Since the 18th century, linguists have been comparing languages to reconstruct both common parents and individual histories for these languages (Jones, 1786; Schleicher, 1861; Brugmann, 1884, for example).",
        "In this paper, we hope to contribute to this effort by presenting a formal model of a particular kind of evolutionary change, namely contact-induced change, and placing limits on when its past presence can be inferred from synchronic evidence.",
        "Contact-induced change can happen when speakers of different languages come in contact, or where there is a sizeable group of bi-or multi-linguals.",
        "We distinguish two different types.",
        "One type, contact-induced assimilation (CIA) changes languages so that they become more similar to each other.",
        "This is the type of contact-induced change that is most obvious and that has been best studied.",
        "The consensus is that it can affect all subsystems of a language depending on the intensity of contact (see eg.",
        "Thomason & Kaufman 1988).",
        "The other type, less frequently noticed and only recently receiving attention (see eg.",
        "Franc?ois 2011, Arnal 2011), is contact-induced differentiation (CID) where the change acts specifically to make the languages less similar.",
        "This type of contact-induced change predominantly affects the parts of a language which speakers are most conscious of being distinct: the phonological forms of morphemes and words.",
        "It is hard to isolate contact-induced change in",
        "related languages from the effects of common inheritance or normal independent drift.",
        "In languages in contact over a long period of time, it is impossible to tell whether the dropping of any single cognate is the result of chance variation or the action of a differentiation process.",
        "Likewise, if languages are compared using a single-valued measure of similarity (such as fraction of cognates in a Swadesh list), the effects of more or less contact-induced changes cannot be distinguished from a greater or lesser time-depth since the common ancestor.",
        "This is shown in figure 1.",
        "induced change between related languages.",
        "Contact-induced assimilation and having a more recent common ancestor can both account for language similarities.",
        "Contact-induced differentiation accounts for less similarity, but so does positing a remoter common ancestor that allows time for more independent drift resulting in greater differentiation without contact.",
        "A single similarity measure is insufficient to separate time-depth from contact-induced change.",
        "Contact-induced change is, however, different from independent drift.",
        "If it is detectable at all, it will be because it creates different counts of synonyms and different proportions of cognates, than drift alone.",
        "Thus, with enough data, it should possible to distinguish the effects of time-depth and contact-induced change.",

        "Perhaps the most extreme example of change aimed at increasing the difference in one's own speech is that of the Uisai dialect of Buin, a language spoken in Papua New Guinea on Bougainville island.",

        "This paper has looked at different ways that relations may evolve from a common parent structure.",
        "They may undergo local mutational changes, global substitutions, independent changes, or those triggered by contact with other relations.",
        "In one class of relations, with reasonable assumptions, it is clear that a large, but possible, amount of data needs to be adduced to ascertain that CIA and/or CID have occured, rather than just shared origin and independent drift.",
        "In historical linguistics, this opens the door, for testing whether the impressionistic accounts of CID are reflected in the distributional properties of the languages concerned.",
        "It may also be possible to circumvent the onerous data requirements, by bringing in data from multiple independent relations within the language, such as those defining morphological structure and phonology, as well as the lexicon.",
        "As mentioned in the introduction, this work is part of a larger programme by the authors to develop statistical tools able to show that CID has taken place, if it has.",
        "This work is partly driven by the need to account historically for the low cognacy but high structural similarity between nearby Australian languages.",
        "In the Daly River area, adjacent languages with very similar phonology, syntax and morphology show remarkably low cognacy counts, often around 8% (Harvey, 2008).",
        "One possible explanation for this is a powerful CID imperative acting over a short time depth to differentiate the vocabularies of the languages.",
        "The result presented in this paper suggests that with sufficient lexical data, direct statistical evidence could be found if this is indeed the correct explanation.",
        "There are potential uses for this work beyond historical linguistics as well.",
        "The model might assist in some cases of plagiarism detection, for example, where two students worked together on an assignment, and then set out to deliberately differentiate them by altering vocabulary.",
        "Similar analysis of documents might reflect other reasons for reworking a text, such as to give it a new identity for a new setting."
