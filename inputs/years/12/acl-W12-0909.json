        "In the edit distance algorithm, values range from 0 to 1 according to the degree of the similarity between the two strings As expected, the distribution of the edit distance values was not uniform and the 1650 string pairs elicited a very small range of edit distance values.",
        "In total, 96% of cases elicited only four different edit distance values (namely, 0.83, 0.87, 0.93 and 0.97); the remaining 4% elicited three different values which were all higher than 0.7.",

        "As in the case of the edit distances, the cosine values were asymmetrically distributed, highly skewed to the right (for high similarity values).",

        "Although the nature of the difference between PHACTS's output and the edit distance algorithm should be better evaluated with respect to a more varied data set, also including pairs of very dissimilar strings, we could preliminarily conclude that the cosine value calculated by PHACTS for pairs of activation-based string representations did not correspond to an edit distance calculation.",
