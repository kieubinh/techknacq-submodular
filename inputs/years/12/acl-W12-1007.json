        "Literature can be studied in a number of different ways and from many different perspectives, but text analysis - in a wide sense - will surely always make up a central component of literature studies.",
        "If such analysis can be integrated with advanced visual methods and fed back to the daily work of the literature researcher, then it is likely to reveal the presence of useful and nuanced insights into the complex daily lives, ideas and beliefs of the main characters found in many of the literary works.",
        "Therefore, the names of all characters appearing in literary texts can be one such line of enquiry, which is both an important sub-field of literature studies (literary onomastics) and at the same time the result obtained by a mature language technology (named entity recognition) which can be turned into a tool in aid of text analysis in this field.",
        "(Flanders et al., 1998) discuss that references to one type of names, namely that of people, are of intrinsic interest because they reveal networks of friendship, enmity, and collaboration; familial relationships; and political alliances.",
        "People's names can be an appropriate starting point for research on biographical, historical, or literary issues, as well as being a key linguistic and textual feature in its permutations and usage.",
        "We argue that the integration of text analysis and visualization techniques, which have turned out to be useful in other scientific fields such as bioinformatics (Nature Methods, 2010), could be put to effective use also in literature studies.",
        "We also see an opportunity to devise new ways of exploring the large volumes of literary texts being made available through national cultural heritage digitization projects.",
        "Digitized information and the task of storing, generating and mining an ever greater volume of (textual) data becomes simpler and more efficient with every passing day.",
        "Along with this opportunity, however, comes a further challenge: to create the means whereby one can tap this great potentiality and engage it for the advancement of (scientific) understanding and knowledge mining.",

        "As a case study, we have analyzed a subset, 13 novels, of the Swedish Literature Bank1 collection through two levels of inquiry by focusing on person names, their gender and their normalized, linked form, including mentions of theistic beings (e.g.",
        "Gods?",
        "names and mythological characters), and examining their appearance in sentences, paragraphs and chapters.",
        "Our aim is to explore the usage of alternative visualization means that provide additional insight by showing the data at higher resolution levels or that permit an analysis of the development of the story in the course of the text.",
        "The employed visualization techniques are scalable enough to display several novels at once and therefore allow a literature scholar to compare different literary texts to each other.",

        "Each of the visualization techniques that we experimented with has its strengths and weaknesses if used for the analysis of a novel with respect to its characters.",
        "Person networks come with the advantage that they can show relationships between characters.",
        "This way clusters of persons that form a group within the story become visible.",
        "In contrast to this, summary plots can only show co-occurrence within a chapter (or smaller text unit).",
        "But their strength is to show the development of the set of persons involved in the plot.",
        "In such a tabular representation it is easy to compare the in",
        "male / female and are sorted within each category according to the overall frequency of the characters.",
        "volvement of different characters across the document.",
        "Even more details are provided by the literature fingerprinting technique.",
        "Because the technique is very scalable, every single word can be visualized.",
        "Coloring is used to encode text properties of interest.",
        "Again, the development of the characters across a document is visible, this time even within single chapters.",
        "However, compared to the summary plot technique, fewer person names can be distinguished.",
        "Obviously, a combination of the three techniques is advisable for analyzing novels with respect to the persons involved.",
        "But our comparison of the three techniques also allows us to identify a missing type of visualization: One that is able to show the development of the story in terms of the characters involved and at the same time is able to display their relationships.",
        "Furthermore, the techniques lead to interesting insight but these newly generated hypotheses need to be checked in the text.",
        "A tighter integration of the actual text source into the visualization tools could therefore be a valuable extension."

        "The combination of robust text analysis with visual analytics brings a new set of tools to literature analysis, provides powerful insights on document collections, and advances our understanding of the evolution of human behavior, society, technological advancement and cultural trends.",
        "As a matter of fact, (Michel, 2010), introduced the term ?Culturomics?, i.e. the application of high-throughput data collection, digital book archives and the like, and analysis to the study of human culture and we believe that novel insights towards this direction can be gained by combining such technologies.",
        "In this paper we have shown that quantifiable data such as (person) names can be identified, extracted, and visualized in novel ways.",
        "In the future we intend to further extend the capabilities for visual literature analysis.",
        "One research goal is the development of a visualization technique that allows to investigate the development of a story across a novel but at the same time shows the relationships between the characters.",
        "Furthermore, we believe that interactive visual analysis tools (instead of static visualizations) open up additional possibilities for literature scholars to explore the large volumes of digitized literary collections that are nowadays available."
