        "This paper examines methods to enrich such metadata with inline links to Wikipedia.",
        "These links allow users to find interesting background information on the items and related topics, and provides a richer experience especially where the metadata is limited.",

        "Mihalcea and Csomai (2007) first addressed the task of automatically adding inline Wikipedia links into text and coined the term Wikification for the process.",
        "Their procedure for wikification used two stages.",
        "The first stage was detection, which involved identifying the terms and phrases from which links should be made.",
        "The most accurate method for this was found to be using link probability, defined as the number of Wikipedia articles that use the term as an anchor, divided by the number of Wikipedia articles that mention it at all.",
        "The next stage, disambiguation ensure that the detected phrases link to the appropriate article.",
        "For example the term plane usually links to an article about fixed wing aircraft.",
        "However it sometimes points to a page describing the mathematical concept of a theoretical surface, or of the tool for flattening wooden surfaces.",
        "To find the correct destination a classifier is trained using features from the context.",
        "Although the quality of re",
        "sults obtained is very good, a large amount of preprocessing is required, since the entire Wikipedia encyclopedia must be parsed.",
        "Milne and Witten (2008) build upon this previous work with the WikiMiner program.",
        "The software is trained on Wikipedia articles, and thus learns to disambiguate and detect links in the same way as Wikipedia editors.",
        "Disambiguation of terms within the text is performed first.",
        "A machine-learning classifier is used with several features.",
        "The main features used are commonness and relatedness, as in Medelyan et al. (2008).",
        "The commonness of a target sense is defined by the number of times it is used a destination from some anchor text e.g. the anchor text ?Tree?",
        "links to the article about the plant more often than the mathematical concept and is thus more common.",
        "Relatedness gives a measure of the similarity of two articles by comparing their incoming and outgoing links.",
        "The performance achieved using their approach is currently state of the art for this task.",
        "The WikiMiner software is freely available2, and has been used as the basis for the approaches presented here.",
        "Recent work on named entity linking and wikification makes use of categories and link information (Bunescu and Pa≈üca, 2006; Dakka and Cucerzan, 2008; Kulkarni et al., 2009).",
        "Wikification has also been applied to the medical domain (He et al., 2011).",
        "Wikipedia categories and links have been used previously to find the similarity between CH items (Grieser et al., 2011).",
