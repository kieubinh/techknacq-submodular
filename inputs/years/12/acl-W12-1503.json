        "We compare two REG algorithms in terms of their performance: the classic Incremental Algorithm and the more recent Graph algorithm.",

        "In our experiments, preferences are learned from training sets that vary in size, in two domains and languages.",

        "Most practical NLG systems include a dedicated module for Referring Expression Generation (REG) in one form or another (Mellish et al., 2006).",
        "One central problem a REG module needs to address is deciding on the contents of a description.",
        "Jordan and Walker (2005), for example, studied human-produced descriptions in a furniture scenario, and found that speakers can refer to a target in many different ways (?the yellow rug?, ?the $150 rug?, etc.).",
        "The question, then, is how speakers decide which attributes to include in a description, and how this decision process can be modeled in a REG algorithm.",
        "When we focus on the generation of distinguishing descriptions (which is often done in REG), it is usually assumed that some attributes are more preferred than others: when trying to identify a chair, for example, its colour is probably more helpful than its size.",
        "It is precisely this intuition of preferred attributes which is incorporated in the Incremental Algorithm (Dale and Reiter, 1995), arguably one of the most influential REG algorithms to date.",
        "The Incremental Algorithm (IA) assumes the existence of a complete, ordered list of preferred attributes.",
        "The algorithm basically iterates through this list, adding an attribute (e.g., COLOUR) to the description under construction if its value (e.g., yellow) helps ruling out one or more of the remaining distractors.",
        "Even though the IA is exceptional in that it relies on a complete ordering of attributes, most current REG algorithms make use of preferences in some way (Fabbrizio et al., 2008; Gerva's et al., 2008; Kelleher, 2007; Spanger et al., 2008; Viethen and Dale, 2010).",
        "The graph-based REG algorithm (Krahmer et al., 2003), for example, models preferences in terms of costs, where cheaper is more preferred.",
        "Contrary to the IA, the graph-based algorithm assumes that preferences operate at the level of attribute-value pairs (or properties) rather than at the level of attributes; in this way it becomes possible to prefer a straightforward size (large) over a subtle colour (mauve, taupe).",
        "Moreover, the graph-based algorithm looks for the cheapest overall description, and may opt for a description with a single, relatively dispreferred property (?the man with the blue eyes?)",
        "when the alternative would be to combine many, relatively preferred properties (?the large, balding man with the bow tie and the striped tuxedo?).",
        "This flexibility is arguably one of the",
        "reasons why the graph-based REG approach works well: it was the best performing system in the most recent REG Challenge (Gatt et al., 2009).",
        "But where do the preferences used in the algorithms come from?",
        "Dale and Reiter point out that preferences are domain dependent, and that determining them for a given domain is essentially an empirical question.",
        "Unfortunately, they do not specify how this particular empirical question should be answered.",
        "The general preference for colour over size is experimentally well-established (Pechmann, 1989), but for most other cases experimental data are not readily available.",
        "An alternative would be to look at human data, preferably in a ?semantically transparent?",
        "corpus (van Deemter et al., 2006), that is: a corpus that contains the attributes and values of all domain objects, together with the attribute-value pairs actually included in a target reference.",
        "Such corpora are typically collected using human participants, who are asked to produce referring expressions for targets in controlled visual scenes.",
        "One example is the TUNA corpus, which is a publicly available data set containing 2280 human-produced descriptions in total, and which formed the basis of various REG Challenges.",
        "Clearly, building a corpus such as TUNA is a time consuming and labour intensive exercise, so it will not be surprising that only a handful of such corpora exists (and often only for English).",
        "This raises an important question: how many human-produced references are needed to make a good estimate of which attributes and properties are preferred?",
        "Do we really need hundreds of instances, or is it conceivable that a few of them (collected in a semantically transparent way) will do?",
        "This is not an easy matter, since various factors might play a role: from which data set are example references sampled, what are the domains of interest, and, perhaps most importantly, which REG algorithm is considered?",
        "In this paper, we address these questions by systematically training two REG algorithms (the Incremental Algorithm and the graph-based REG algorithm) on sets of human-produced descriptions of increasing size and evaluating them on a held-out test set; we do this for two different domains (people and furniture descriptions) and two data sets in two different languages (TUNA and D-TUNA, the Dutch version of TUNA).",
        "That size of the training set may have an impact on the performance of a REG algorithm was already suggested by Theune et al. (2011), who used the English TUNA corpus to determine preferences (costs) for the graph-based algorithm using a similar learning curve set-up as we use here.",
        "However, the current paper expands on Theune et al. (2011) in three major ways.",
        "Firstly, and most importantly, where Theune et al. reported results for only one algorithm (the graph-based one), we directly compare the performance of the graph-based algorithm and the Incremental Algorithm (something which, somewhat surprisingly, has not been done before).",
        "Secondly, we test whether these algorithms perform differently in two different languages (English and Dutch), and thirdly, we use eight training set sizes, which is more than the six set sizes that were used by Theune et al. Below we first explain in more detail which algorithms (Section 2) and corpora (Section 3) we used for our experiments.",
        "Then we describe how we derived costs and orders from subsets of these corpora (Section 4), and report the results of our experiments focusing on effects of domain, language and size of the training set (Section 5).",
        "We end with a discussion and conclusion (Section 6), where we also compare the performance of the IA trained on small set sizes with that of the classical Full Brevity and Greedy algorithms (Dale and Reiter, 1995)."

        "In this section we briefly describe the two algorithms, and their settings, used in our experiment.",
        "For details about these algorithms we refer to the original publications.",
        "The Incremental Algorithm (IA) The basic assumption underlying the Incremental Algorithm (Dale and Reiter, 1995) is that speakers ?prefer?",
        "certain attributes over others when referring to objects.",
        "This intuition is formalized in the notion of a list of attributes, ranked in order of preference.",
        "When generating a description for a target, the algorithm iterates through this list, adding an attribute to the description under construction if its value helps rule out any of the distractors not previously ruled out.",
        "There is no backtracking in the IA, which means that a selected attribute is always realized in",
        "the final description, even if the inclusion of later attributes renders it redundant.",
        "In this way, the IA is capable of generating overspecified descriptions, in accordance with the human tendency to mention redundant information (Pechmann, 1989; Engelhardt et al., 2006; Arts et al., 2011).",
        "The TYPE attribute (typically realized as the head noun) has a special status in the IA.",
        "After running the algorithm it is checked whether TYPE is in the description; if not, it is added, so that TYPE is always included even if it does not rule out any distractors.",
        "To derive preference orders from human-produced descriptions we proceeded as follows: given a set of n descriptions sampled from a larger corpus (where n is the set size, a variable we systematically control in our experiment), we counted the number of times a certain attribute occurred in the n descriptions.",
        "The most frequently occurring attribute was placed at the first position of the preferred attributes list, followed by the second most frequent attribute, etc.",
        "In the case of a tie (i.e., when two attributes occurred equally often, which typically is more likely to happen in small training sets), the attributes were ordered alphabetically.",
        "In this way, we made sure that all ties were treated in the same, comparable manner, which resulted in a complete ranking of attributes, as required by the IA.",
        "The Graph-based Algorithm (Graph) In the graph-based algorithm (Krahmer et al., 2003), which we refer to as Graph, information about domain objects is represented as a labelled directed graph, and REG is modeled as a graph-search problem.",
        "The output of the algorithm is the cheapest distinguishing subgraph, given a particular cost function assigning costs to properties (i.e., attribute-value pairs).",
        "By assigning zero costs to some properties Graph is also capable of generating overspecified descriptions, including redundant properties.",
        "To ensure that the graph search does not terminate before the free properties are added, the search order must be explicitly controlled (Viethen et al., 2008).",
        "To ensure a fair comparison with the IA, we make sure that if the target's TYPE property was not originally selected by the algorithm, it is added afterwards.",
        "In this study, both the costs and orders required by Graph are derived from corpus data.",
        "We base the property order on the frequency with which each attribute-value pair is mentioned in a training corpus, relative to the number of target objects with this property.",
        "The properties are then listed in order of decreasing frequency.",
        "Costs can be derived from the same corpus frequencies; here, following Theune et al. (2011), we adopt a systematic way of deriving costs from frequencies based on k-means clustering.",
        "Theune and colleagues achieved the best performance with k = 2, meaning that the properties are divided in two groups based on their frequency.",
        "The properties in the group with the highest frequency get cost 0.",
        "These ?free?",
        "properties are always included in the description if they help distinguish the target.",
        "The properties in the less frequent group get cost 1; of these properties, the algorithm only adds the minimum number necessary to achieve a distinguishing description.",
        "Ties due to properties occurring with the same frequency need not be resolved when determining the cost function, since Graph does not assume the existence of a complete ordering.",
        "Properties that did not occur in a training corpus were automatically assigned cost 1.",
        "Like we did for the IA, we listed attribute-value pairs with the same frequency in alphabetical order."

        "Our results show that small data sets can be used to train these algorithms, achieving results that are not significantly different from those derived from a much larger training set.",
        "In the simple furniture domain even one training item can already be sufficient, at least for the IA.",
        "As shown in Table 4, on the whole the IA needed fewer training data than Graph (except in the English people domain, where Graph only needed a set size of 10 to hit the ceiling for Dice, while the IA needed a set size of 20).",
        "Given that the IA ranks attributes, while the graph-based REG algorithm ranks attribute-value pairs, the difference in required training data is not surprising.",
        "In any domain, there will be more attribute-value pairs than attributes, so determining an attribute ranking is an easier task than determining a ranking of attribute-value pairs.",
        "Another advantage of ranking attributes rather than attribute-value pairs is that it is less vulnerable to the problem of ?missing data?.",
        "More specifically, the chance that a specific attribute does not occur in a small training set is much smaller than the chance that a specific attribute-value pair does not occur.",
        "As a consequence, the IA needs fewer data to obtain complete attribute orderings than Graph needs to obtain costs for all attribute-value pairs.",
        "Interestingly, we only found interactions between training set size and algorithm in the furniture domain.",
        "In the people domain, there was no significant difference between the size of the training sets required by the algorithms.",
        "This could be explained by the fact that the people domain has about twice as many attributes as the furniture domain, and fewer values per attribute (see Table 1).",
        "This means that for people the difference between the number of attributes (IA) and the number of attribute-value pairs (Graph) is not as big as for furniture, so the two algorithms are on more equal grounds.",
        "Both algorithms performed better on furniture than on people.",
        "Arguably, the people pictures in the TUNA experiment can be described in many more different ways than the furniture pictures can, so it stands to reason that ranking potential attributes and values is more difficult in the people than in the furniture domain.",
        "In a similar vein, we might expect Graph's flexible generation strategy to be more useful in the people domain, where more can be gained by the use of costs, than in the furniture domain, where there are relatively few options anyway, and a simple linear ordering may be quite sufficient.",
        "This expectation was at least partially confirmed by the results: although in most cases the differences are not significant, Graph tends to perform numerically better than the IA in the people domain.",
        "Here we see the pay-off of Graph's more fine-grained preference ranking, which allows it to distinguish between more and less salient attribute values.",
        "In the furniture domain, most attribute values appear to be more or less equally salient (e.g., none of the colours gets notably mentioned more often), but in the people domain certain values are clearly more salient than others.",
        "In particular, the attributes HASBEARD and HASGLASSES are among the most frequent attributes in the people domain when their value is true (i.e., the target object can be distinguished by his beard or glasses), but they hardly get mentioned when their value is false.",
        "Graph quickly learns this distinction, assigning low costs and a high ranking to <HASBEARD, true> and <HASGLASSES, true> while assigning high costs and a low ranking to <HASBEARD, false> and <HASGLASSES, false>.",
        "The IA, on the other hand, does not distinguish between the values of these attributes.",
        "Moreover, the graph-based algorithm is arguably more generic than the Incremental Algorithm, as it can straightforwardly deal with relational properties and lends itself to various extensions (Krahmer et al., 2003).",
        "In short, the larger training investment required for Graph in simple domains may be compensated by its versatility and better performance on more complex domains.",
        "To test this assumption, our experiment should be repeated using data from a more realistic and complex domain, e.g., geographic descriptions (Turner et al., 2008).",
        "Unfortunately, currently no such data sets are available.",
        "Finally, we found that the results of both algorithms were better for the Dutch data than for the English ones.",
        "We think that this is not so much an ef",
        "fect of the language (as English and Dutch are highly comparable) but rather of the way the TUNA and D-TUNA corpora were constructed.",
        "The D-TUNA corpus was collected in more controlled conditions than TUNA and as a result, arguably, it contains training data of a higher quality.",
        "Also, because the D-TUNA corpus does not contain any location properties (X-and Y-DIMENSION) its furniture and people domains are slightly less complex than their TUNA counterparts, making the attribute selection task a bit easier.",
        "One caveat of our study is that so far we have only used the standard automatic metrics on REG evaluation (albeit in accordance with many other studies in this area).",
        "However, it has been found that these do not always correspond to the results of human-based evaluations, so it would be interesting to see whether the same learning curve effects are obtained for extrinsic, task based evaluations involving human subjects.",
        "Following Belz and Gatt (2008), this could be done by measuring reading times, identification times or error rates as a function of training set size.",
        "Comparing IA with FB and GR We have shown that small set sizes are sufficient to reach ceiling for the IA.",
        "But which preference orders (PO?s) do we find with these small set sizes?",
        "And how does the IA's performance with these orders compare to the results obtained by alternative algorithms such as Dale and Reiter's (1995) classic Full Brevity (FB) and Greedy Algorithm (GR)?",
        "?",
        "a question explicitly asked by van Deemter et al. (2012).",
        "In the furniture domain, all five English training sets of size 5 yield a PO for which van Deemter et al. showed that it causes the IA to significantly outperform FB and GR (i.e., either C(olor)O(rientation)S(ize) or CSO; note that here we abstract over TYPE which van Deemter and colleagues do not consider).",
        "When we look at the English people domain and consider set size 10 (ceiling for Dice), we find that four out of five sets have a preference order where HAIRCOLOUR, HASBEARD and HASGLASSES are in the top three (again disregarding TYPE); one of these is the best performing preference order found by van Deemter and colleagues (GBH), another performs slightly less well but still significantly better than FB and GR (BGH); the other two score statistically comparable to the classical algorithms.",
        "The fifth people PO includes X-and Y-DIMENSION in the top three, which van Deemter et al. ignore.",
        "In sum: in almost all cases, small set sizes (5 and 10 respectively) yield POs with which the IA performs at least as well as the FB and GR algorithms, and in most cases significantly better.",
        "Conclusion We have shown that with few training instances, acceptable attribute selection results can be achieved; that is, results that do not significantly differ from those obtained using a much larger training set.",
        "Given the scarcity of resources in this field, we feel that this is an important result for researchers working on REG and Natural Language Generation in general.",
        "We found that less training data is needed in simple domains with few attributes, such as the furniture domain, and more in relatively more complex domains such as the people domain.",
        "The data set being used is also of influence: better results were achieved with D-TUNA than with the TUNA corpus, which probably not so much reflects a language difference, but a difference in the way the corpora were collected.",
        "We found some interesting differences between the IA and Graph algorithms, which can be largely explained by the fact that the former ranks attributes, and the latter attribute-value pairs.",
        "The advantage of the former (coarser) approach is that overall, fewer training items are required, while the latter (more fine-grained) approach is better equipped to deal with more complex domains.",
        "In the furniture domain both algorithms had a similar performance, while in the people domain Graph did slightly better than the IA.",
        "It has to be kept in mind that these results are based on the relatively simple furniture and people domains, and evaluated in terms of a limited (though standard) set of evaluation metrics.",
        "We hope that in the near future semantically transparent corpora for more complex domains will become available, so that these kinds of learning curve experiments can be replicated."
