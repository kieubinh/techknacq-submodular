        "With the increasing interest in data-driven surface realization, the question on the adequate annotation of corpora for generation also becomes increasingly important.",
        "While in the early days of stochastic generation, annotations produced for other applications were used (Knight and Hatzivassiloglou, 1995; Langkilde and Knight, 1998; Bangalore and Rambow, 2000; Oh and Rudnicky, 2000; Langkilde-Geary, 2002), the poor results obtained, e.g., by (Bohnet et al., 2010) with the original CoNLL 2009 corpora, show that annotations that serve well for other applications, may not do so for generation and thus need at least to be adjusted.1 This has also been acknowledged in the run-up to the surface realization challenge 2011 (Belz et al., 2011), where a considerable amount of work has been invested into the conversion of the annotations of the CoNLL 2008 corpora (Surdeanu et al., 2008), i.e., PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005), which served as the reference treebank, into a more ?generation friendly?",
        "annotation.",
        "However, all of the available annotations are to a certain extent still syntactic.",
        "Even PropBank and its generation-oriented variants contain a significant number of syntactic features (Bohnet et al., 2011b).",
        "Some previous approaches to data-driven generation avoid the problem related to the lack of semantic resources in that they use hybrid models that imply a symbolic submodule which derives the syntactic representation that is then used by the stochastic submodule (Knight and Hatzivassiloglou, 1995; Langkilde and Knight, 1998).",
        "(Walker et al., 2002), (Stent et al., 2004), (Wong and Mooney, 2007), and (Mairesse et al., 2010) start from deeper structures: Walker et al. and Stent et al. from deep-syntactic structures (Mel?c?uk, 1988), and Wong and Mooney and Mairesse et al. from higher order predicate logic structures.",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge, 1Trained on the original ConLL 2009 corpora, (Bohnet et al., 2010)'s SVM-based generator reached a BLEU score of 0.12 for Chinese, 0.18 for English, 0.11 for German and 0.14 for Spanish.",
        "Joining the unconnected parts of the sentence annotations to connected trees (as required by a stochastic realizer) improved the performance to a BLEU score of 0.69 for Chinese, 0.66 for English, 0.61 for German and 0.68 for Spanish.",
        "none of them uses corpora annotated with the structures from which they start.",
        "To deep stochastic generation, the use of hybrid models is not an option and training a realizer on syntactically-biased annotations is highly problematic in the case of data-to-text NLG, which starts from numeric time series or conceptual or semantic structures: the syntactic features will be simply not available in the input structures at the moment of application.2.",
        "Therefore, it is crucial to define a theoretically sound semantic annotation that is still good in practical terms.",
        "Our goal is thus to discuss some general principles of a semantic generation-oriented annotation schema and offer a first evaluation of its possible impact on stochastic generation.",
        "Section2 details what kind of information is available respectively not available during data-to-text generation.",
        "Section 3 states some general principles that constrain an adequate semantic representation, while Section 4 formally defines their well-formedness.",
        "Section 5 reports then on the experiments made with the proposed annotation, and Section6 offers some conclusions.",
        "2 What can we and what we cannot count on?",
        "In data-to-text or ontology-to-text generation, with the standard content selection?discourse structur-ing?surface generation pipeline in place, and no hard-wired linguistic realization of the individual chunks of the data or ontology structure, the input to the surface realization module can only be an abstract structure that does not contain any syntactic (and even lexical) information.",
        "Conceptual graphs in the sense of Sowa (Sowa, 2000) are structures of this kind;3 see Figure 1 for illustration (?Cmpl?",

        "= ?Characteristic?, and ?Amt?",
        "= ?Amount?).",
        "Content selection accounts for the determination of the content units that are to be communicated and Discourse Structuring for the delimitation of Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) 2Even though in this article we are particularly interested in data-to-text generation, we are convinced that clean semantic and syntactic annotations also facilitate text-to-text generation.",
        "3But note that this can be any other content structure.",
        "and their organization and for the discursive relations between them (e.g., Bcas (Because) in the Figure).",
        "In particular, such a structure cannot contain: ?",
        "non-meaningful nodes: governed prepositions (BECAUSE of, CONCENTRATION of), auxiliaries (passive be), determiners (a, the); ?",
        "syntactic connectors (between A and B), relative pronouns, etc.",
        "?",
        "syntactic structure information: A modifies B, A is the subject of B, etc.",
        "In other words, a deep stochastic generator has to be able to produce all syntactic phenomena from generic structures that guarantee a certain flexibility when it comes to their surface form (i.e., without encoding directly this type of syntactic information).",
        "For instance, a concentration of NO2 can be realized as a NO2 concentration, between 23h00 and 00h00 as from 23h00 until 00h00, etc.",
        "This implies that deep annotations as, for instance, have been derived so far from PennTreeBank/PropBank, in which either all syntactic nodes of the annotation are kept (as in (Bohnet et al., 2010)) or only certain syntactic nodes are removed (as THAT complementizers and TO infinitives in the shared task 2011 on surface realization (Belz et al., 2011)) still fall short of a genuine semantic annotation.",
        "Both retain a lot of syntactic information which is not accessible in genuine data-to-text generation: nodes (relative pronouns, governed prepositions and conjunctions, determiners, auxiliaries, etc.)",
        "and edges (relative clause edges, control edges, modifier vs. argumen-tal edges, etc.).",
        "This lets us raise the question how the annotation policies should look like to serve generation well and to what extent existing resources such as PropBank comply with them already.",
        "We believe that the answer is critical for the future research agenda in generation and will certainly play an outstanding role in the shared tasks to come.",
        "In the next section, we assess the minimal principles which the annotation suitable for (at least) data-to-text generation must follow in order to lead to a core semantic structure.",

        "semantic annotation Before talking about generation-suitable annotation, we must make some general assumptions concerning NLG as such.",
        "These assumptions are necessary (but might not always be sufficient) to cover deep generation in all its subtleties: (i) data-to-text generation starts from an abstract conceptual or semantic representation of the content that is to be rendered into a well-formed sentence; (ii) data-to-text generation is a series of equivalence mappings from more abstract to more concrete structures, with a chain of inflected words as the final structure; (iii) the equivalence between the source structure Ss and the target structure St is explicit and self-contained, i.e., for the mapping from Ss to St, only features contained in Ss and St are used.",
        "The first assumption is in the very nature of the generation task in general; the second and the third are owed to requirements of statistical generation (although a number of rule-based generators show these characteristics as well).",
        "The three basic assumptions give rise to the following four principles.",
        "1.",
        "Semanticity: The semantic annotation must cap",
        "ture the meaning and only the meaning of a given sentence.",
        "Functional nodes (auxiliaries, determiners, governed conjunctions and prepositions), node duplicates and syntactically-motivated arcs should not appear in the semantic structure: they reflect grammatical and lexical features, and thus already anticipate how the meaning will be worded.",
        "For example, meet-AGENT?the (directors), meet-LOCATION?in (Spain), meet-TIME?in (2002) cited in (Buch-Kromann et al., 2011) as semantic annotation of the phrase meeting between the directors in Spain in 2002 in the Copenhagen Dependency Treebank does not meet this criterion: the, and both ins are functional nodes.",
        "Node duplicates such as the relative pronoun that in the PropBank annotation (But Panama illustrates that their their substitute is a system) that?R-A0-produces (an absurd gridlock) equally reflect syntactic features, as do syntactically-motivated arc labels of the kind ?R(elative)-A0?.",

        "with syntactico-functional relations (?AM-MNR?",

        "The predicate-argument analysis of modifiers suggests namely that they are predicative semantemes that take as argument the node that governs them in the syntactic structure; in the above structure: absurd?A1?gridlock.",
        "This applies also to locatives, temporals and other ?circumstan-tials?, which are most conveniently represented as two-place semantemes: house?A1?location?",
        "A2?Barcelona, party?A1?time?A2?yesterday, and so on.",

        "As a consequence, we believe that new annotation policies are needed to obtain a high quality semantic resource.",
