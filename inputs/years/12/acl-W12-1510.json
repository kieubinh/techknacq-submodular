        "The fundamental goal underlying LA was to develop a system capable of generating high quality texts in a wide variety of languages, particularly minority and endangered languages.",
        "Drafts produced by LA are always easily understandable, grammatically correct, semantically equivalent to the source documents, and at approximately a sixth grade reading level.",
        "Because the system is based on linguistic research, LA is expected to work well for typologically diverse languages; it works equally well for languages that are coranking or clause chaining, highly isolating or highly polysynthetic, fusional or agglutinative, etc.",
        "A natural language generator of this type is practical only when translating large quantities of texts into many different languages.",
        "Therefore semantic representations for a large variety of texts are being developed for LA.",
        "This system is a tool which enables linguists to document a language and simultaneously generate numerous texts for the speakers of that language.",
        "A model of LA is shown in Figure 1.",
        "As seen in the figure, there are five primary components: 1) the ontology, 2) the semantic representations, 3) the lexicon, 4) the transfer grammar, and 5) the synthesizing grammar.",
        "The two components",

        "These innate concepts can be used to explicate every word in every language.",
        "If semantic representations were developed using only these innate primitives, the problem of lexical mismatch between languages would be eliminated.",
        "However, building semantic representations using only the innate concepts is unwieldy, so semantically simple molecules were identified in a principled manner.",
        "For our semantic molecules, we elected to use the defining vocabulary in Longman's Contemporary English Dictionary (2003).",
        "By using these semantically simple concepts, the problem of lexical mismatch between source and target languages is significantly reduced.",
        "There are certainly still instances of lexical mismatch, and we have an approach for dealing with them which will be described below.",

        "Therefore a new format was developed specifically for LA's semantic representational system.",
        "LA's semantic representations are comprised of a controlled, English influenced metalanguage augmented by a feature system which was designed to accommodate a wide variety of languages.",
