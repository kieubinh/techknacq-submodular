        "A practical problem in developing ontologies for the semantic web is that mistakes are hard to spot.",
        "One reason for this lies in the opacity of the standard OWL formalisms, such as OWL/RDF, which are designed for efficient processing by computer programs and not for fast comprehension by people.",
        "Various tools have been proposed to address this problem, including not only graphical interfaces such as Prote?ge?, but NLG (Natural Language Generation) programs that verbalise the axioms of an ontology as text (Kaljurand and Fuchs, 2007; Schwitter and Meyer, 2007; Hart et al., 2008).",
        "Using such a tool, a mistaken axiom presented through a sentence like ?Every person is a movie?",
        "immediately leaps to the eye.",
        "Although there is evidence that verbalisation helps developers to check individual axioms (Stevens et al., 2011), there remains a more subtle problem of undesired entailments, often based on interactions among axioms.",
        "The difference between axioms and entailments is that whereas axioms are statements encoded by the developer, entailments are statements inferred from axioms by automated reasoners such as FaCT++ (Tsarkov and Horrocks, 2006).",
        "Because reasoning systems interpret statements absolutely literally, it is quite common for apparently innocuous axioms to lead to absurd conclusions such as ?Everything is a person?, ?Nothing is a person?, or indeed ?Every person is a movie?.",
        "The standard reasoning algorithms, based on tableau algorithms, will compute these entailments efficiently, but they provide no information that helps explain why an undesired conclusion was drawn, and hence which axiom or axioms need to be corrected.",
        "To provide an explanation of an entailment, the first step is obviously to determine which axioms are relevant to the inference.",
        "A set of relevant axioms is known technically as a justification of the entailment, defined as any minimal subset of the ontology from which the entailment can be drawn (Kalyan-pur, 2006).",
        "The minimality requirement here means that if any axiom is removed from a justification, the entailment will no longer be inferable.",
        "Drawing on Kalyanpur's work, the most direct strategy for planning an explanation is simply to verbalise the axioms in the justification, followed by the entailment, with no additional content.",
        "This strategy serves as a useful baseline for comparison, and might even be effective for some simple justi",

        "An example of a justification requiring further explanation is shown in Table 1.",
        "Statements are presented in mathematical notation in the middle column (rather than in OWL, which would take up a lot more space), with a natural language gloss in the right column.",
        "Since these sentences are handcrafted they should be more fluent than the output of a verbaliser, but even with this benefit, it is extremely hard to see why the entailment follows.",
        "The key to understanding this inference lies in the first axiom, which asserts an equivalence between two classes: good movies, and things that only have ratings of four stars.",
        "The precise condition for an individual to belong to the second class is that all of its ratings should be four star, and this condition would be trivially satisfied if the individual had no ratings at all.",
        "From this it follows that people, parrots, parsnips, or in general things that cannot have a rating, all belong to the second class, which is asserted to be equivalent to the class of good movies.",
        "If individuals with no rating are good movies, then by axioms 3 and 4 they are also movies, so we are left with two paradoxical statements: individuals with a rating are movies (axiom 2), and individuals without a rating are movies (the intermediate conclusion just derived).",
        "Since everything that exists must either have some rating or no rating, we are driven to the conclusion that everything is a movie, from which it follows that any person (or parrot, etc.)",
        "must also be a movie: hence the entailment.",
        "Our target explanation for this case is as follows: Every person is a movie because the ontology implies that everything is a movie.",

        "Statement (a) is stated in axiom 2 in the justification.",
        "Statement (b) is inferred because the ontology implies that (c) anything that has no rating at all is a good movie, and (d) every good movie is a movie.",

        "Since the second class trivially accepts anything that has no rating at all, we conclude that anything that has no rating at all is a good movie.",
        "Note that in this or any other intelligible explanation, a path is traced from premises to conclusion by introducing a number of intermediate statements, or lemmas.",
        "Sometimes a lemma merely unpacks part of the meaning of an axiom ?",
        "the part that actually contributes to the entailment.",
        "This is clearly what we are doing when we draw from axiom 1 the implication that all individuals with no ratings are good movies.",
        "Alternatively a lemma could be obtained by combining two axioms, or perhaps even more.",
        "By introducing appropriate lemmas of either type, we can construct a proof tree in which the root node is the entailment, the terminal nodes are the axioms in the justification, and the other nodes are lemmas.",
        "An explanation based on a proof tree should be easier to understand because it replaces a single complex inference step with a number of simpler ones.",
        "Assuming that some kind of proof tree is needed, the next question is how to construct proof trees that provide effective explanations.",
        "Here two conditions need to be met: (1) the proof tree should be correct, in the sense that all steps are valid; (2) it should be",
        "accessible, in the sense that all steps are understandable.",
        "As can be seen, one of these conditions is logical, the other psychological.",
        "Several research groups have proposed methods for producing logically correct proof trees for description logic (McGuinness, 1996; Borgida et al., 1999; Horridge et al., 2010), but explanations planned in this way will not necessarily meet our second requirement.",
        "In fact they could fail in two ways: either they might employ a single reasoning step that most people cannot follow, or they might unduly complicate the text by including multiple steps where a single step would have been understood equally well.",

        "Our deduction rules were derived through a corpus study of around 500 OWL ontologies.",
