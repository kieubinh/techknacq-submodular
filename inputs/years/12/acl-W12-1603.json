        "One challenge of implementing spoken dialogue systems for long-term interaction is how to adapt the dialogue as user and system become more familiar.",

        "For tutoring systems, this may additionally require knowing how relationships are signaled among non-adult users.",
        "We therefore investigate conversational strategies used by teenagers in peer tutoring dialogues, and how these strategies function differently among friends or strangers.",
        "In particular, we use annotated and automatically extracted linguistic devices to predict impoliteness and positivity in the next turn.",
        "To take into account the sparse nature of these features in real data we use models including Lasso, ridge estimator, and elastic net.",
        "We evaluate the predictive power of our models under various settings, and compare our sparse models with standard non-sparse solutions.",
        "Our experiments demonstrate that our models are more accurate than non-sparse models quantitatively, and that teens use unexpected kinds of language to do relationship work such as signaling rapport, but friends and strangers, tutors and tutees, carry out this work in quite different ways from one another."

        "Rapport, the harmonious synchrony between interlocutors, has numerous benefits for a range of dialogue types, including direction giving (Cassell et al., 2007) or contributing to patient recovery (Vowles and Thompson, 2012).",
        "In peer tutoring, an educational paradigm in which students of similar ability tutor one another, friendship among tutors and tutees leads to better learning (Gartner et al., 1971).",
        "With the burgeoning use of spoken dialogue systems in education, understanding the process by which two humans build and signal rapport during learning becomes a vital step for implementing spoken dialogue systems (SDSs) that can initiate (and, as importantly, maintain) a successful relationship with students over time.",
        "However, implementing a tutorial dialogue system that appropriately challenges students in the way that peers do so well (Sharpley et al., 1983), while still demonstrating the rapport that peers can also provide, calls for understanding the differences in communication between peer tutors just meeting and those who are already friends.",
        "The Tickle-Degnen and Rosenthal (1990) model provides a starting point by outlining the components of rapport, including the finding that positivity decreases over the course of a relationship.",
        "The popularity of this model, however, has not diminished the disproportionate attention that positivity and politeness receive in analyses of rapport (Brown and Levinson, 1978), including in the vast majority of computational approaches to rapport-building in dialogue (Stronks et al., 2002; Johnson and Rizzo, 2004; Bickmore and Picard, 2005; Gratch et al., 2006; McLaren et al., 2007; Cassell et al., 2007; Baker et al., 2008; Bickmore et al., 2011).",
        "The creation and expression of rapport is complex, and can also be signaled through negative, or impolite, exchanges (Straehle, 1993; Watts, 2003; Spencer-Oatey, 2008) that communicate affection and relationship security among intimates who can flout common social norms (Culpeper, 2011; Kienpoint-ner, 1997).",
        "However, it is an open question as to whether such rudeness is likely to impress a new student on the first day of class.",
        "We must better understand how and when impoliteness and other negative dialogue moves can contribute to the development and expression of the rapport that is so important in educational relationships.",
        "In this analysis, then, we begin with a corpus of tutoring chat data annotated with a set of affectively-charged linguistic devices (e.g. complaining, emoticons), and then differentiate between the linguistic devices that friend and stranger interlocutors employ (with friendship standing as a proxy for pre-existent rapport) and the resulting social effects or functions of those devices on the partners.",
        "Since our ultimate goal is to build an SDS that can adapt to the user's language in real time, we also automatically extract lexical and syntactic features from the conversations.",
        "And, in order to determine what the system should say to evoke particular",
        "responses, we predict social effects in partner two from the use of the linguistic devices in partner one.",
        "Since we want to understand how the system can deal with newly met peers as well as peers who have become friends, we develop and evaluate our model on dyads of friends and then evaluate the same model with dyads of strangers, to examine whether dyads with less a priori rapport react differently to the same linguistic devices.",
        "Of course, in addition to understanding the phenomenon of rapport in all of its complexity, a major challenge for building rapport-signaling SDS is to construct a compact feature space that capture only reliable rapport signals and generalizes well across different speakers.",
        "Of course phenomena such as insults, complaints and pet names, no matter how important, appear relatively rarely in data of this sort.",
        "Training discriminative models with maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) on such datasets usually results in assigning too much weight on less frequent signals.",
        "This standard MLE training method not only produces dense models, but may also overestimates lower frequency features that might be unreliable signals and overfit to a particular set of speakers.",
        "In recent studies on speaker state prediction that use lexical features, it has been shown that MLE estimators demonstrate large performance gaps between non-overlapping speaker datasets (Jeon et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2012a).",
        "On the other hand, recent studies on `1/`2 based group penalty for evaluating dialogue systems (Gonza?lez-Brenes and Mostow, 2011), structured sparsity for linguistic structure prediction (Martins et al., 2011), and discovering historical legal opinions with a sparse mixed-effects latent variable model (Wang et al., 2012b) have all shown concrete benefits of modeling sparsity in language-related predictive tasks.",
        "We therefore apply sparsity-sensitive models that can prevent less frequent features from overfitting.",
        "We start with the `1- regularized Lasso (Tibshirani, 1994) model, since, compared to other covariance matrix based sparse models, such as sparse Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), the Lasso model is straightforward and requires fewer computing resources when the feature dimension is high.",
        "Hence, we compare the contributions of both automated features and annotated features using the proposed Lasso model to predict impoliteness and positivity.",
        "In addition to Lasso and a logistic regression baseline, we introduce two alternative penalty models: the non-sparse ridge (le Cessie and van Houwelin-gen, 1992) estimator, and an elastic net model (Zou and Hastie, 2005).",
        "The ridge estimator applies a quadratic penalty for feature selection, resulting in a smooth objective function and a non-sparse feature space, which can be seen as a strong non-sparse penalty model.",
        "We investigate the elastic net model, because it balances the pros and cons of Lasso and ridge estimators, and enforces composite penalty.",
        "In addition to the model comparisons, by varying the different sizes of feature windows (number of turns in the dialogue history), we empirically show that our proposed sparse log-linear model is flexible, enabling the model to capture long-range dependency.",
        "This approach also allows us to extend previous work on speaker state prediction.",
        "Although speaker state prediction has attracted much attention in the dialogue research community, most studies have focused on the analysis of anger, frustration, and other classic emotions (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004; Liscombe et al., 2005; Devillers and Vidrascu, 2006; Ai et al., 2006; Grimm et al., 2007; Gupta and Ni-tendra., 2007; Metallinou et al., 2011).",
        "Recently, Wang and Hirschberg (2011) proposed a hierarchical model that detects level of interest of speakers in dialogue, using a multistream prediction feedback technique.",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge, we are among the first to study the problem of automatic impoliteness and positivity prediction in dialogue.",
        "Because our ultimate goal is to build an SDS that responds to users?",
        "language use over time, the features from the user's target turn that the model is aiming to predict are not observable, which renders the task more difficult than previous speaker state detection tasks.",
        "Our main contributions are three-fold: (1) analysis of linguistic devices that function to signal rapport among friends - and their effects on non-friend dyads; (2) detailed analyses of language behavior features that predict these rapport behaviors - both impoliteness and positivity - in the next turn of teenagers?",
        "peer tutoring sessions; (3) an evaluation of non-sparse and sparse log-linear models for predicting impoliteness and positivity.",
        "By understanding the signals of rapport that a person is likely to display in response to various linguistic devices, we can begin to build an SDS that can anticipate the social response and adapt to the rapport-signaling efforts of its partner, both as a newly introduced technology, and, over time, as a system with whom the user has a rapport."
