        "The ability to recognize the discourse relations that exist between arbitrary text spans is crucial for understanding a given text.",
        "Indeed, a number of natural language processing (NLP) applications rely on it ?",
        "e.g., question answering, text summarization, and textual entailment.",
        "Fortunately, explicit discourse relations ?",
        "discourse relations marked by explicit connectives ?",
        "have been shown to be easily identified by automatic means (Pitler et al., 2008): each such connective is generally strongly coupled with a particular relation.",
        "The connective ?because?, for example, serves as a prominent cue for the CONTINGENCY relation.",
        "The identification of implicit discourse relations ?",
        "where such connectives are absent ?",
        "is much harder.",
        "It has been the subject of much recent research since the release of the Penn Discourse Treebank 2.0 (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008), which annotates relations between adjacent text spans in Wall Street Journal (WSJ) articles, while clearly distinguishing implicit from explicit discourse relations.1 Recent studies, for example, explored the utility of various classes of features for the task, including linguistically informed features, context, constituent and dependency parse features, and features that encode entity information or rely on language models (Pitler et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2009; Louis et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2010).",
        "To date, however, there has not been a systematic study of combinations of these features for implicit discourse relation identification.",
        "In addition, the results of existing studies are often difficult to compare because of differences in data set creation, feature set choice, or experimental methodology.",
        "This paper provides a systematic study of previously proposed features for implicit discourse relation identification and identifies feature combinations that optimize F1-score using forward selection (John et al., 1994).",
        "We report the performance of our binary (one vs. rest) classifiers on the PDTB data set for its four top-level discourse relation classes: COMPARISON, CONTINGENCY, EXPANSION, and TEMPORAL.",
        "In each case, the resulting classifiers achieve the best F1-scores for the PDTB to date.",
        "We 1Research on implicit discourse relation recognition prior to the release of the PDTB instead relied on synthetic data created by removing explicit connectives from explicit discourse relation instances (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002), but the trained classifiers do not perform as well on real-world data (Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2007).",
        "further identify factors for feature extraction that can have a major impact performance, including stemming and lexicon look-up.",
        "Finally, by documenting an easily replicable experimental methodology and making public the code for feature extraction2, we hope to provide a new set of baselines for future studies of implicit discourse relation identification."

        "In the work reported here, we use the relation type to distinguish examples of explicit vs. implicit discourse relations.",
        "In particular, we consider all instances with a relation type other than explicit as implicit relations since they lack an explicit connective between the text spans.",
        "The relation sense determines the relation that exists between its text span arguments as one of: COMPARISON, CONTINGENCY, EXPANSION, and TEMPORAL.",

        "The four relation senses comprise the target classes for our classifiers.",
        "A notable feature of the PDTB is that the annotation is done on the same corpus as Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), which provides parse trees and part-of-speech (POS) tags.",

        "Word pairs as features.",
        "Starting with earlier works that proposed them as features (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002), some form of word pairs has generally been part of feature sets for implicit discourse relation recognition.",
        "According to our research, however, these features provide little or no additional gain, once other features are employed.",
        "This seems sensible, since we now have a clearer idea of the types of information important for the task and have developed a variety of feature types, each of which aims to represent these specific aspects of the discourse relation arguments.",
        "Thus, general features like word pairs may no longer have a role to play for implicit discourse relation identification.",
        "Preprocessing.",
        "Preprocessing turned out to impact the classifier performance immensely, especially for features like polarity and inquirer tags that rely on information retrieved from a lexicon.",
        "For these features, if a match for a given word is not found in the lexicon, no information is passed on to the classifier.",
        "As an example, consider the General Inquirer lexicon.",
        "Most of its verb entries are present tense singular in form; thus, without stemming, dictionary look up fails for a large portion of the verbs.",
        "In our case, the F1-score increases by roughly 10% after stemming.",
        "Further tuning is possible by a few hand-written",
        "as good as that of the binary classifiers shown here.",
        "One major difference is that it is harder to balance the number of instances across all the classes when training 4-way classifiers.",
        "rules to guide lexicon lookup.",
        "The word supplied, for instance, becomes suppli after stemming, which still fails to match the lexicon entry supply, unless adjusted accordingly.",
        "Binning.",
        "An additional finding regards features that capture numeric, rather than binary, information, such as polarity.",
        "Since this feature encodes the counts of each type of sentiment word (with respect to each argument and their cross product), and Naive Bayes can only interpret binary features, we first employed a binning mechanism with each bin covering a single value.",
        "For instance, if arg1 consists of three positive words, we included arg1pos1, arg1pos2 and arg1pos3 as features instead of just arg1pos3.",
        "The rationale behind binning is that it captures the proximity of related instances.",
        "Imagine having three instances each with one, two, and three positive words in arg1, respectively.",
        "Without binning, the features added are simply arg1pos1, arg1pos2, arg1pos3, respectively.",
        "From the perspective of the classifier, the third instance is no more similar to the second instance than it is to the first instance, even though having three positive words is clearly closer to having two positive words than having one positive word.",
        "With binning, this proximity is captured by the fact that the first instance has just one feature in common with the third instance, whereas the second instance has two.",
        "Binning, however, significantly degrades performance on most of the classification tasks.",
        "One possible explanation is that these features function as an abstraction of certain lexical patterns, rather than directly capturing similarities among instances of the same class."
