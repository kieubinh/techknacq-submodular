        "Users of the demonstration system can use a web-based version (simulating pedestrian movement using StreetView) to engage in a variety of interleaved conversations such as navigating from A to B, using the QA functionality to learn more about points of interest (PoI) nearby, and searching for amenities and tourist attractions.",

        "Although navigation and local information are available to users through smartphone apps, there are still important problems such as how such information is delivered safely and proactively, and without cognitively overloading the user.",
        "(Kray et al., 2003) suggested that cognitive load of information presented in textual and speech-based interfaces is medium and low respectively when compared to more complicated visual interfaces.",
        "Our objective, therefore, is to build a hands-free and eyes-free system that engages the pedestrian user by presenting all information and receiving user requests through speech only.",
        "In addition, and in contrast to other mobile applications, this system is conversational ?",
        "meaning that it accumulates information over time, and plans its utterances to achieve long-term goals.",
        "It integrates with a city model and a visibility engine (Bar-tie and Mackaness, 2012) to identify points of interests and visibile landmarks for presentation, a pedestrian tracker to improve the GPS positioning of the user and a question-answering (QA) system to enable users to explore information about the city more freely than with a graphical interface.",
        "Table 1 presents an example dialogue interaction with the system showing the use of visibility information and Question-Answering.",
        "User: Take me to Princes Street.",
        "System: Turn left on to South Bridge and walk towards the tower in front of you.",
        "... System: Near you is the famous statue of David Hume.",
