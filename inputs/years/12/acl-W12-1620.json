        "SimCoach virtual humans are not designed to act as therapists, but rather to encourage users to explore available options and seek treatment when needed by fostering comfort and confidence in a safe and anonymous environment where users can express their concerns to an artificial conversational partner without fear of judgment or possible repercussions.",

        "There is often a tension between system initiative and performance of the system's decision-making for understanding and actions.",
        "A strong system-initiative policy reduces the action state space since",
        "user actions are only allowed at certain points in the dialogue.",
        "System initiative also usually makes it easier for a domain expert to design a dialogue policy that will behave as desired.1 Such systems can work well if the limited options available to the user are what the user wants to do, but can be problematic otherwise, especially if the user has a choice of whether or not to use the system.",
        "In particular, this approach may not be well suited to an application like SimCoach.",
        "At the other extreme, some systems allow the user to say anything at any time, but have fairly flat dialogue policies, e.g., (Leuski et al., 2006).",
        "These systems can work well when the user is naturally in charge, such as in interviewing a character, but may not be suitable for situations in which a character is asking the user questions, or mixed initiative is desired.",
        "True mixed initiative is notoriously difficult for a manually constructed call-flow graph, in which the system might want to take different actions in response to similar stimuli, depending on local utilities.",
        "Reinforcement learning approaches (Williams and Young, 2007; English and Heeman, 2005) can be very useful at learning local policy optimizations, but they require large amounts of training data and a well-defined global reward structure, are difficult to apply to a large state-space and remove some of the control, which can be undesirable (Paek and Pierac-cini, 2008).",
        "Our approach to this problem is a forward-looking reward seeking agent, similar to that described in (Liu and Schubert, 2010), though with support for complex dialogue interaction and its authoring.",
        "Authoring involves design of local subdialogue networks with preconditions and effects, and also qualitative reward categories (goals), which can be instantiated with specific reward values.",
        "The dialogue manager, called FLoReS, can locally optimize policy decisions, by calculating the highest overall expected reward for the best sequence of subdialogues from a given point.",
        "Within a subdialogue, authors can craft the specific structure of interaction.",
        "Briefly, the main modules that form FLoReS are: ?",
        "The information state, a propositional knowl-1Simple structures, such as a call flow graph (Pieraccini and Huerta, 2005) and branching narrative for interactive games (Tavinor, 2009) will suffice for authoring.",
        "edge base that keeps track of the current state of the conversation.",
        "The information state supports missing or unknown information by allowing atomic formulas to have 3 possible values: true, false and null.",
        "?",
        "A set of inference rules that allows the system to add new knowledge to its information state, based on logical reasoning.",
        "Forward inference facilitates policy authoring by providing a mechanism to specify information state updates that are independent of the specific dialogue context.2 ?",
        "An event handling system, that allows the information state to be updated based on user input, system action, or other classes of author-defined events (such as system timeouts).",
        "?",
        "A set of operators.",
        "Operators represent local dialogue structure (trees), and can also be thought of as reusable subdialogues.",
        "Each state within the subdialogue can include a reward for reaching that state.",
        "Rewards are functions of the goals of the system, and are the main method used to decide what to do when there is more than one applicable operator.",
        "Operators have preconditions and effects.",
        "Effects specify changes to the information state.",
        "The preconditions define when an operator can be activated."
