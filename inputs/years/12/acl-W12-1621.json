        "Their knowledge and representation of the shared world are significantly different.",
        "When a shared perceptual basis is missing, grounding references to the environment will be difficult (Clark, 1996).",
        "Therefore, a foremost question is to understand how partners with mismatched perceptual capabilities mediate shared basis to achieve referential grounding.",

        "This setting is similar to the baseline approach used in (Prasov and Chai, 2008; Prasov and Chai, 2010).",
        "In the second setting, the complete graph-based approach is applied, i.e. both the object's properties and the relations between objects are considered.",
        "As shown in Table 2, although the improvements of performance for the no-error objects and mis-segmented objects are not significant due to the small sample sizes, the performance for the mis-recognized objects is significantly improved by 27.3% (p < .001).",
        "The improvement for the overall performance is also significant (by 24.9%, p < .001).",
        "The comparison between two settings have demonstrated the importance of representing and reasoning on relations between objects in referential grounding, and the graph-based approach provides an ideal solution to capture relations.",
        "In particular, even CV error rate is high (due to the simple CV algorithms we used), our method is still able to achieve 66% accuracy of grounding the mis-recognized objects.",
        "Furthermore, when a referred object is completely ?missing?",
        "in the vision graph",
        "due to segmentation error6, our method is capable to detect such discrepancy between linguistic input and visual perception.",
        "The results have shown that 44.4% of those cases have been correctly detected.",
        "This is also a very important aspect since information about failures of grounding will allow the dialogue manager and/or the vision system to adapt better strategies."

        "The work presented here only represents an initial step in our ongoing investigation towards mediating shared perceptual basis in situated dialogue.",
        "It consists of several simplifications which will be addressed in our future work.",
        "First, the discourse graph is created only based on contributions from the director, using manual annotations of formal semantics of the discourse.",
        "As shown in the examples (Section 3.2), the collaborative discourse has rich dynamics reflecting participants?",
        "collaborative behaviors.",
        "So our future work is to model these different discourse dynamics and take them into account in the creation of the discourse graph.",
        "The discourse graph will be created after each contribution as the conversation unfolds.",
        "When utterances are automatically processed, semantics of these utterances often will not be extracted correctly or completely as in their manual annotations.",
        "Therefore, our future work will also explore how to efficiently match hypothesized discourse graphs (from automated semantic processing) with vision graphs.",
        "Second, our current symbol grounding functions are very simple and intuitive.",
        "Our future work will explore more sophisticated models that have theoretical motivations (e.g., grounding spatial terms based on the Attentional Vector Sum (AVS) model (Regier and Carlson, 2001)) and enable automated acquisition of these functions (Roy, 2002; Gorniak and Roy, 2004b).",
        "In addition, we will explore context-based symbol grounding functions where context will be explicitly modeled.",
        "Grounding a linguistic term to a visual feature will be influenced by contextual factors such as surroundings of the environment, the 6For example, if the director refers to ?a white ball?",
        "but CV algorithm fails to detect that object from the environment, then the node in the discourse graph representing ?a white ball?",
        "should not be mapped to anything in the vision graph.",
        "discourse history, the speaker's individual preference, and so on.",
        "Lastly, as shown in our examples, the matcher also contributes significantly to ground references.",
        "This appears to suggest that, in situated dialogue, lower-calibre partners (i.e., robot, and here the matcher) also make extra effort to ground references.",
        "The underlying motivation could be their urge to match what they perceive from the environment to what they are told by their higher-calibre partners (i.e., human).",
        "This motivation can be potentially modeled as graph-matching and can be used to guide the design of system responses.",
        "We will explore this idea in the future."

        "In situated human robot dialogue, a robot and its human partners have significantly mismatched capabilities in perceiving the environment, which makes grounding of references in the environment especially difficult.",
        "To address this challenge, this paper describes an empirical study investigating how human partners mediate the mismatched perceptual basis.",
        "Based on this data, we developed a graph-based approach and formulate referential grounding as inexact graph matching.",
