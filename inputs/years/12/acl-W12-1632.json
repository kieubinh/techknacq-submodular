        "The automatic identification of information status (Prince, 1981; 1992), i.e. categorizing discourse entities into different classes on the given-new scale, has recently been identified as an important issue in natural language processing (Nissim, 2006; Rahman and Ng, 2011; 2012).",
        "It is widely acknowledged that information status and, more generally, information structure,1 is reflected in word order, in the form of referring expressions as well as in prosody.",
        "In computational linguistics, the ability to automatically label text with information status, therefore, could be of great benefit to many applications, including surface realization, text-to-speech synthesis, anaphora resolution, summarization, etc.",
        "The task of automatically labeling text with information status, however, is a difficult one.",
        "Part of 1Information structure is usually taken to describe clause-internal divisions into focus-background, topic-comment, or theme-rheme, which are in turn defined in terms of contextual factors such as given-new information, salience, contrast and alternatives, cf. Steedman and Kruijff-Korbayova?",
        "(2003), Krifka (2007).",
        "Information status is the subfield of information structure which exclusively deals with the given-new distinction and which is normally confined to referring expressions.",
        "the difficulty arises from the fact that, to a certain degree, such labeling requires world knowledge and semantic comprehension of the text, but another obstacle is simply that theoretical notions of information status are not used consistently in the literature.",
        "In this paper we outline a system, trained on a small amount of data, that achieves encouraging results on the task of automatically labeling transcribed German radio news data with fine-grained information status labels."

        "A simpler variant of the task is anaphoricity detection (discourse-new detection) (Bean and Riloff, 1999; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Uryupina, 2003; Denis and Baldridge, 2007; Zhou and Kong, 2011), which divides discourse entities into anaphoric (given) and new.",
        "Identifying discourse-new expressions in texts is helpful as a precursor to coreference resolution, since, by definition, there is no need to identify antecedents for new entities.",
        "In the linguistic literature, referring expressions have been distinguished in much more detail, and there is reason to believe that this could also provide useful information for NLP applications.",
        "Nissim (2006) and Rahman and Ng (2011) developed methods to automatically identify three different classes: OLD, MEDIATED and NEW expressions.",
        "This classification, which is described in Nissim et al. (2004), has been used for annotating the Switchboard dialog corpus (Calhoun et al., 2010), on which both studies are based.",

(2010), (ii) use (morpho-)syntactic and functional features automatically extracted from a deep linguistic parser in our CRF sequence model, (iii) test our approach on a different language (German), (iv) show that high accuracy can be achieved with a limited number of training examples, and (v) that the approach works on a different genre (transcribed radio news bulletins which contain complex embedded phrases like an offer to the minority Tamil population of Sri Lanka, not typically found in spoken dialog).",

        "Unused.",
        "In manual annotation practice, it is very often impossible to decide whether an entity is hearer-known, since this depends on who we assume the hearer to be; and even if we agree on a recipient, we may still be mistaken about their knowledge.",

        "It remains for future work to show the effect of different label set granularities in practical applications.",

        "Sometimes world knowledge is required in order to be able to accurately predict a label; for example, to know that the pope can be categorized as UNUSED-KNOWN, because it can occur discourse-initially, whereas the priest must usually be categorized as GIVEN.",
        "The BRIDGING relationship is also difficult to capture without some world knowledge.",
        "For example, to infer that the waitress can be categorized as BRIDGING in the context of the restaurant requires information that links the two concepts.",
