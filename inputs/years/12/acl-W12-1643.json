        "The work in this paper builds on, connects and extends several strands of research: grounded semantics (Roy, 2005), which worries about the connection between language and the situation in which it is used, but often does not go beyond the word level to include linguistic structure information and does not work incrementally;1 statistical NLU (see e.g. (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2009; Liang et al.,",
        "2011)), which tries to infer linguistic structures automatically, but normally stops at generating, not interpreting semantic representations, and works with (the text of) full utterances and not incrementally on speech data; and incremental NLU, which is a less intensely studied field, but where previous contributions (such as (DeVault et al., 2009; Devault et al., 2011; Aist et al., 2007; Schlangen and Skantze, 2009)) have not dealt with learned grounded semantics.",
        "We go beyond this earlier work in that we study a model that is incremental, can use linguistic structure, and learns from conversational data a semantics that connects the utterance to its visual and discourse context.",
        "We have looked at individual components of this before (grounded semantics in (Siebert and Schlangen, 2008); incremental reference resolution in (Schlangen et al., 2009); incremental general NLU in (Heintze et al., 2010); interaction between incremental parsing and reference resolution in (Peldszus et al., 2012)), but use a more sophisticated model in this work and show that tackling these tasks jointly improves performance.",
        "We apply Markov Logic Networks (MLNs, (Richardson and Domingos, 2006)) as the machine learning technique in our experiments.",
        "MLNs have recently received attention in language processing fields like co-reference resolution (Chen, 2009), semantic role labeling (Meza-Ruiz and Riedel, 2009), spoken (albeit neither situational nor incremental) NLU (Meurs et al., 2008), and web information extraction (Satpal et al., 2011).",
        "The framework offers a convenient way of specifying factor functions on sets of random variables for undirected graphical models (Markov Random Fields, see (Kindermann and Snell, 1980)), in such a way that the factors correspond to weighted first order formulae and the joint distribution of random variables corresponds to probabilities of groundings of formulae.",
        "In this way, MLNs offer a helpful bridge between symbolic representation and stochastic inference.",
        "Weights of formulae can be specified by hand or learned from data; we used the latter capability.",
        "Figure 1 shows data flow in our task.",
        "We use combinations of situated context, previous context, and linguistic information as evidence to an MLN, and infer what action is to be taken, what object is to be acted upon, and specifications of the manner of execution."

        "These representations were not further manually checked for appropriateness, and hence do not necessarily represent ground truth.",
        "As in (Peldszus et al., 2012), we discarded utterances without clear semantic alignments.",
        "One major difference from them is that we do include the 661 utterances that used pronouns to refer to pieces, leaving us with 1687 utterances, 5.43 words per utterance (sd 2.36), with a vocabulary of 237 distinct words.",
        "These were transcribed utterances and not automatic speech recognition output, so our results represent an upper-bound on real world performance.",
        "The task that we wanted our model to tackle can then be stated as follows: given information about the current state of the world (i.e., the game board), the previous system action, and about the (possibly still not-yet completed) utterance, predict an interpretation for the utterance, in the form of such a frame.",
        "The elements of the frame may be specified separately; as argued in (Heintze et al., 2010), this is the most appropriate format for incremental processing since it provides a rough alignment between parts of the utterance and parts of its interpretation.",
        "Figure 3 illustrates such a desired output from the model.",

        "This is a pleasing result, as it shows that the model is indeed capable of making the desired connection between language and world; as none of it was not explicitly given, which words and linguistic structure linked to which properties was completely learned by the discriminative training.",
