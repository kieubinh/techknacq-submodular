        "Mental State Verbs (MSVs), such as think, know, and want, are very frequent in child-directed language, yet children use them productively much later than lower-frequency action verbs, such as fall and throw (Johnson and Wellman, 1980; Shatz et al., 1983).",
        "Psycholinguistic theories have suggested that there is a delay in the acquisition of MSVs because they require certain cognitive and/or linguistic skills that are not available during the early stages of language development.",
        "For example, MSVs typically occur with a sentential complement (SC) that refers to the propositional content of the mental state, as in He thinks Mom went home.",
        "Children have to reach a stage of syntactic development that includes some facility with SCs in order to fully acquire MSVs.",
        "However, even at 3?5 years old, children are able to process SCs only imperfectly (e.g., Asplin, 2002).",
        "Even when children are able to produce SCs with other verbs (such as verbs of communication, as in He said Mom went home), there is a lag before they productively use MSVs referring to actual mental content (Diessel and Tomasello, 2001).1 Psycholinguists have suggested that young children lack the conceptual ability to conceive that others have mental states separate from their own (Bartsch and Wellman, 1995; Gopnik and Meltzoff, 1997), further delaying the acquisition of MSVs.",
        "Another factor suggested to contribute to the difficulty of acquiring MSVs is their informational requirements (Gleitman et al., 2005; Papafragou et al., 2007).",
        "Children learn word meanings by figuring out which aspects of an observed scene are referred to by a particular word (Quine, 1960).",
        "MSVs often refer to aspects of the world that are not directly observable (i.e., the beliefs and desires of another entity).",
        "Thus, in addition to the above-mentioned challenges posed by children's developing linguistic/conceptual abilities, children may simply have difficulty in identifying the relevant mental content necessary to learning MSVs.",
        "In particular, Papafragou et al. (2007) [PCG] have shown that even given adequate conceptual and linguistic abilities (as in adults) the mental events in a scene (the actors?",
        "internal states) are not attended to as much as the actions, unless there are cues that heighten the salience of the mental content.",
        "PCG further demonstrate that children's sensitivity to such cues lags behind that of adults, suggesting an additional factor in the acquisition of MSVs which 1Researchers have noted that children use MSVs in fixed phrases, in a performative use or as a pragmatic marker, well before they use them to refer to actual mental content (e.g., Diessel and Tomasello, 2001; Shatz et al., 1983).",
        "Here by ?acquisition of MSVs?, we are specifically referring to children learning usages that genuinely refer to mental content.",
        "is the developmental change in how strongly such cues are associated with the relevant mental content.",
        "We develop a computational model of MSV acquisition (the first, to our knowledge) to further illuminate these issues.",
        "We extend an existing model of verb argument structure acquisition (Alishahi and Stevenson, 2008) to enable the representation and processing of mental state semantics and syntax.",
        "We simulate the developmental change proposed by PCG through a gradually increasing ability in the model to appropriately attend to the mental content of a scene.",
        "In addition, we suggest that even when the learner's semantic representation is biased towards the action content, the learner attends to the observed SC syntax in an MSV utterance.",
        "This is especially important to account for the pattern of errors in child data.",
        "Our model thus extends the account of PCG to show that a probabilistic interplay of the semantic and syntactic features of a partial and somewhat erroneous perception of the input, combined with a growing ability to attend to cues indicative of mental content, can help to account for children's developmental trajectory in learning MSVs."

      "text": [
        "To investigate the linguistic and contextual cues that could help in learning MSVs, PCG use a procedure called the Human Simulation Paradigm (originally proposed by Gillette et al., 1999).",
        "In this paradigm, subjects are put in situations intended to simulate various word learning conditions of young children.",
        "E.g., in one condition, adults watch silent videos of caregivers interacting with children, and are asked to predict the verb uttered by the caregiver.",
        "In another condition, subjects hear a sentence containing a nonce verb (e.g., gorp) after watching the video, and are asked what gorp might mean.",
        "We focus on two factors investigated by PCG in the performance of adults and children in identifying MSVs.",
        "The first factor they investigated involved the syntactic frame used when subjects were given a sentence with a nonce verb.",
        "PCG hypothesized that an SC frame would be a cue to mental content (and an MSV), since the SC refers to propositional content.",
        "The second factor PCG examined was whether the video described a ?true belief?",
        "or a ?false belief?",
        "scene: A true belief scene shows an ordinary situation which unfolds as the character in the scene expects ?",
        "e.g., a little boy takes food to his grandmother, and she is there in the house as expected.",
        "The corresponding false belief scene has an unexpected outcome for the character ?",
        "in this case, another character has replaced the grandmother in her bed.",
        "Here the hypothesis was that such false belief scenes would heighten the salience of mental activity in the scene and lead to greater belief verb responses in describing them.",
        "PCG's results showed that both adults and children were sensitive to both the scene and syntax cues, but children's ability to draw on such cues was inferior to that of adults.",
        "They thus propose that the difference between children and adults is that children have not yet formed as strong an association as adults between the cues and the mental content of a scene as required to match the performance of adults.",
        "Nonetheless, their results suggest that the participating children had the conceptual and linguistic abilities required for MSVs, since they were able to produce them under conditions with sufficiently strong cues.",
        "We simulate PCG's experiments using a novel computational approach.",
        "Following PCG, we assume that even when a learner is able to perceive the general semantic and syntactic properties of a belief scene and associated utterance, they may not attend to the mental content in every situation, and that this ability improves over time.",
        "We model a developmental change in a learner's attention to mental content: At early stages, corresponding to the state of young children, the learner largely focuses on the action aspects of a belief scene, even in the presence of an utterance using an MSV.",
        "Over time, the learner gradually increases in the ability to attend appropriately to the mental aspects of such a scene and utterance, until adult-like competence is achieved in associating the available cues with mental content.",
        "Importantly, our work extends the proposal of PCG by bringing in evidence from other relevant studies on children's ability to process SCs.",
        "More specifically, we suggest that when children hear a sentence like I think Mom went home, they recognize (and record) the existence of an SC, while at the same time they focus on the action semantics as the main (most salient) event.",
        "In other words, we assume that children's imperfect syntactic abil",
        "ities are at least sufficient to recognize the SC usage (Nelson et al., 1989; Asplin, 2002).",
        "However, their attention is mostly directed towards the action expressed in the embedded complement, either because mental content is less easily observable than action (Papafragou et al., 2007), or due to the linguistic saliency of the embedded clause (Diessel and Tomasello, 2001; Dehe and Wichmann, 2010).",
        "As mentioned above, we model this misrepresentation by considering the possibility of not attending to mental content in a belief scene.",
        "Specifically, we assume that (i) the model is very likely to overlook the mental content at earlier stages (corresponding to children's observed behaviour); and (ii) as the model ?ages?",
        "(i.e., receives more input), its attentional abilities improve and thus the model is more likely to focus on the mental content as the main proposition.",
        "Our results suggest that these changes to the model lead to a match between our model's behaviour and PCG's differential results for children and adults."

        "As in PCG, the likelihood of Belief verb predictions in our model is higher than that of Action verbs for the False Belief situation, in both ?child?",
        "and ?adult?",
        "stages, with a larger difference as the model ?ages?",
        "(i.e., processes more input).",
        "For the True Belief situation also the pattern is similar to that of PCG: Belief verbs are less likely than Action verbs to be predicted at early stages, but as the model receives more input, the likelihood of Belief verbs becomes slightly higher than that of Action verbs.",
        "PCG's hypothesis of greater attention to the action content of a scene implicitly implies that children focus on the action semantics and syntax of the embedded SC of a Belief verb.",
        "We have suggested instead that the focus is on the action semantics within the context of the SC syntax of the MSV.",
        "To directly evaluate the necessity of our latter assumption, we performed a simulation using both action syntax and semantics to represent the physical interpretation of the belief scene.",
        "Specifically, the syntactic features in this representation were non-SC structure with only one verb.",
        "Based on these settings, the model predicted high likelihood for the Belief verbs from a very early stage, not showing the same delayed acquisition pattern exhibited by PCG's results.",
        "This result suggests that the SC syntax plays an important role in MSV acquisition."

        "Various studies have considered why mental state verbs (MSVs) appear relatively late in children's productions (e.g., Shatz et al., 1983; Bartsch and Wellman, 1995).",
        "The Human Simulation Paradigm has revealed that adult participants tend to focus on the physical action cues of a scene (Gleitman et al., 2005).",
        "PCG's results further show that cues emphasizing mental content lead to a significant increase in MSV responses in such tasks.",
        "Moreover, they show that a sentential complement (SC) structure is a stronger cue to an MSV than the semantic cues emphasizing mental content.",
        "In this paper we adapt a computational Bayesian model to analyze such semantic and syntactic cues in the ability of children to identify them.",
        "We simulate an attentional mechanism of the growing sensitivity to mental content in a scene into the model.",
        "We show that both the ability to observe the obscure mental content and the ability to recognize the use of an SC structure are essential to replicate PCG's observations.",
        "Moreover, our results predict the strong association of MSVs to the SC syntax, for the first time (to our knowledge) in a computational model.",
        "Children often use verbs other than MSVs in experimental settings in which MSVs would be the appropriate or correct verb choice (Asplin, 2002; Kidd et al., 2006; Papafragou et al., 2007).",
        "Our model presents similar variability in verb choice.",
        "One underlying cause of this behaviour in the model is its association of action semantics to SC syntax, due to the tendency to observe the physical cues in a scene associated with an utterance using an MSV with an SC.",
        "Preliminary results (not reported here) imply that the association of perception and communication verbs that frequently appear with SC contribute to this pattern of verb choice (see de Villiers, 2005, for theoretical support).",
        "Our results require further work to fully understand this behaviour.",
        "Finally, our model will facilitate future work in regards to the performative usage of MSVs, in which MSVs do not indicate mental content, but rather direct the conversation.",
        "Several studies (e.g., Diessel and Tomasello, 2001; Howard et al., 2008), have referred to the role performative use likely plays in MSV acquisition, since the first MSV usages by children are performative.",
        "The semantic properties MSVs take in performative usages is not currently represented in our lexicon.",
        "However, the physical interpretation of the mental scene that we have used in our experiments here is similar to the performative usage: i.e., the main perceived action and the observed syntactic structure are the same.",
        "At the moment, our results imply that the association of MSVs with their genuine mental meaning is delayed by interpretations of the mental scene which overlook the mental content.",
        "In the future, we aim to incorporate the semantic representation of performative usages to better analyze their effect on MSV acquisition."
