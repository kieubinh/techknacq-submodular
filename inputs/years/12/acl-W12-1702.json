        "For a given concrete noun concept, humans are usually able to cite properties (e.g., elephant is animal, car has wheels) of that concept; cognitive psychologists have theorised that such properties are fundamental to understanding the abstract mental representation of concepts in the brain.",
        "Consequently, the ability to automatically extract such properties would be of enormous benefit to the field of experimental psychology.",
        "This paper investigates the use of semi-supervised learning and support vector machines to automatically extract concept-relation-feature triples from two large corpora (Wikipedia and UKWAC) for concrete noun concepts.",
        "Previous approaches have relied on manually-generated rules and hand-crafted resources such as WordNet; our method requires neither yet achieves better performance than these prior approaches, measured both by comparison with a property norm-derived gold standard as well as direct human evaluation.",

        "The representation of concrete concepts (e.g., car, banana, spanner) in the human brain has long been an important area of investigation for cognitive psychologists.",
        "Recent theories of this mental representation have proposed a componential, property-based and distributed model of conceptual knowledge (e.g., Farah and McClelland (1991), Randall et al.",
        "(2004), Tyler et al. (2000)).",
        "In order to empirically test these cognitive theories, researchers have moved towards employing real-world knowledge in their experiments.",
        "This knowledge has usually been procured from human-derived lists of properties taken from property norming studies (Garrard et al., 2001; McRae et al., 2005).",
        "In such studies, human participants are asked to describe and note properties of a given concept (e.g., has shell for turtle).",
        "Synonymous responses are grouped together as a single property and those meeting a certain minimum response-frequency threshold are taken as valid properties.",
        "The most wide-ranging study to date was that conducted by McRae et al. (2005): some sample properties from this set are in Table 1.",
        "As others have noted (Murphy, 2002; McRae et al., 2005), property norming studies are prone to a number of deficiencies.",
        "One such weakness is the incongruity of shared properties across even highly-related concepts: human respondents exhibit a lack of consistency when listing properties that are common to many similar concepts.",
        "For example, while has legs is listed as a property of crocodile in the McRae norms, it is absent as a property of alligator.",
        "A related issue is the non-comprehensive nature of the generated norms ?",
        "although they may cover the most salient properties for a given concept, they are unlikely to comprise all of a concept's properties (e.g., has heart does not appear as a property of any of the 92 animal concepts).",
        "Our research aims to use NLP techniques to create a system able to emulate the output of such studies, and overcome some of the aforementioned weaknesses.",
        "Our proposed system begins by searching dependency-parsed corpora for those sentences containing concept and feature terms which are also found in a McRae norm-derived training set of properties.",
        "For these sentences, the system generates grammatical relation/part-of-speech structural attributes and applies support vector machines (SVMs) to learn sets of attributes likely to indicate the instantiation of a property in a sentence.",
        "These",
        "turtle bowl has a shell 25 is round 19 lays eggs 16 used for eating 12 swims 15 used for soup 11 is green 14 used for food 11 lives in water 14 used for liquids 10 is slow 13 used for eating cereal 10 an animal 11 made of plastic 8 walks 10 used for holding things 7 walks slowly 10 is curved 7 has 4 legs 9 found in kitchens 7",
        "duction frequencies for turtle and bowl.",
        "learned patterns of salient attributes are finally applied to a corpus to derive new properties for unseen concepts.",
        "Our task is a challenging one: the properties we seek are extremely diverse in their form.",
        "They range from the simple (e.g., banana is yellow) to the complex (e.g., bayonet found at the end of a gun).",
        "Although the properties can broadly be divided into a number of categories (encyclopedic, taxonomic, functional, etc) there is not a great deal of regularity in the nature of the properties a given noun will likely possess: it is highly concept-dependent.",
        "Furthermore, we hope to derive these properties from corpora, with the assumption that these properties will manifest themselves therein.",
        "Indeed, Andrews et al. (2005) discuss a theory of human knowledge which relies on a combination of both distributional (i.e., derived from spoken and written language) and experiential data (i.e., that derived from our interactions with the real world), claiming that the necessary contribution of each data-type for a comprehensive human semantic representation is non-trivial.",
        "Finally, there are difficulties associated with evaluating our system's output directly against a set of human-generated property norms: we discuss these in further detail later.",
        "Given their provenance, the properties found in property norms are free-form.",
        "To simplify our task we apply a more rigid representation to the properties we already have and to those we aim to seek.",
        "We delineate each property into a concept relation feature triple (see Section 2.2) and our task becomes one of finding valid relation feature pairs given a particular concept.",
        "This recoding renders our task more well-defined and makes evaluation of our method",
        "Marine reptiles include five species of turtle.",
        "more comparable to previous and related work.",
        "Having framed our task in this way, there is an obvious parallel with relation extraction: both necessitate the selection/classification of relationships between individual entities (in our case, between concept and feature).",
        "Hearst (1992) was the first to propose a pattern-based approach to this task using lexico-syntactic patterns to automatically extract hyponyms and this technique has frequently been used for ontology learning.",
        "For example, Pantel and Pennacchiotti (2008) linked instantiations of a set of semantic relations into existing semantic ontologies and Davidov et al. (2007) employed seed concepts from a given semantic class to discover relations shared by concepts in that class.",
        "Our task is more complex than classic relation extraction for two main reasons: 1) the relations which we aim to extract are not limited to a small set of just a few well-defined relations (e.g., is-a and part-of) nor to the relations of a specific semantic class (e.g., capital-is for countries).",
        "Indeed the relations can be as many and diverse as the concepts themselves (e.g., each concept could possess a unique and distinguishing relation and feature).",
        "2) We are attempting to simultaneously extract two pieces of information: features of the concept and those features?",
        "defining relationship with the concept, but only those relations and features which would be classified as ?common-sense?, something which is easy for humans to recognise but difficult (if not impossible) to describe rigorously or formally.",
        "There has recently been work on the automatic ex",
        "traction of binary relations that scale to a web corpus, for example the ReVerb (Etzioni et al., 2011) and WOE (Wu and Weld, 2010) systems.",
        "These systems are designed to extract legitimate relations from a given sentence.",
        "In contrast, our aim is to capture more general relationships which are ?common-sense?",
        "; just because an extracted relation is correct in a given context does not automatically make it true in general.",
        "Previous reasoned approaches to our task have taken their lead from Hearst and her successors, employing manually-created rulesets to extract such properties from corpora (e.g., Baroni et al. (2009), Devereux et al. (2010), and our comparison system (Kelly et al., 2010)).",
        "Baroni et al. extract relational information in the form of ?type-sketches?, which give an approximate, implicit description of the relationship whereas we are aiming to extract explicit relations between the target concept and its corresponding features.",
        "Devereux et al. and Kelly et al. have attempted this, but both employ WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) to extract semantic relatedness information.",
        "We use semi-supervised learning as it offers a flexible technique of harnessing small amounts of labelled data to derive information from unlabelled datasets/corpora and allows us to guide the extraction towards our desired ?common-sense?",
        "output.",
