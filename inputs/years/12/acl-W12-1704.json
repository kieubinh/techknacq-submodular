        "Some loci in the phrase structure systems of natural languages appear to employ center embedding recursion (Chomsky, 1957), or at least an approximation of it (Christiansen and Chater, 1999).",
        "For example, one can embed a clause within a clause in English, using the object-extracted relative clause construction (e.g., the dog that the goat chased barked.).",
        "But such recursion does not appear in every phrase and may not appear in every language (Everett, 2005).",
        "Therefore, the system that learns natural languages must have a way of recognizing recursion when it occurs.",

        "Here, we use the term ?finite state?",
        "to refer to a system that can only be in a finite number of states.",
        "We use the term ?recursion?",
        "to refer to situations in which multiple embeddings require the use of an unbounded symbol memory to keep track of unfinished dependencies.1 We focus here on the case of center-embedding recursion, which can be generated by a context free grammar (one symbol on the left of each rule, finitely many symbols on the right) or a push-down automaton (stack memory + finite state controller) but not by a finite state device (Hopcroft and Ullman, 1979).",
        "One natural approach to the recursion recognition problem, recently explored by Perfors et al. (2011), involves Bayesian grammar selection.",
        "Perfors et al.",
        "'s model considered a range of grammars, including both finite state and context free grammars.",
        "Their system, parameterized by data from English-speaking children in the Childes Database selected a context free grammar.",
        "Several features of this approach are notable: (i) There is a rich set of structural assumptions (the grammars in the pool of candidates).",
        "(ii) Because many plausible grammars generate overlapping data sets, a complexity ranking is also assumed and the system operates under Occam's Razor: prefer simpler grammars.",
        "(iii) Grammar selection and on-line parsing are treated as sep1This is a narrow construal of the term ?recursion?.",
        "Sometimes the term is used for any situation in which a rule can be applied arbitrarily many times in the generation of a single sentence, including finite-state cases.",
        "arate problems in that the system is evaluated for coverage of the observed sentences, but the particular method of parsing plays no role in the selection process.",
        "Here, we focus on a contrasting approach: recurrent neural network models discover the structure of grammatical systems by sequentially processing the corpus data, attempting to predict after each word, what word will come next (Elman, 1990; Elman, 1991).",
        "With respect to the properties mentioned above, the neural network approach has some advantages: (i) Formal analyses of some of the networks and related systems (Moore, 1998; Siegel-mann, 1999; Tabor, 2009b) indicate that these models make even richer structural assumptions than the Bayesian approach: if the networks have infinite precision, then some of them recognize all string languages, including non-computable ones.",
        "For a long while, theorists of cognition have adopted the view that positing a restrictive hypothesis space is desirable?otherwise a theory of structure would seem to have little substance.",
        "However, if one offers a hypothesis about the organization of the hypothesis space, and a principle that specifies the way a learning organism navigates in the space, then the theory can still make strong, testable predictions.",
        "We suggest that assuming a very general function class is preferable to presupposing arbitrary grammar or class restrictions.",
        "(ii) The recurrent networks do not employ an independently defined complexity metric.",
        "Instead, the learning process successively breaks symmetries in the initially unbiased weight set, driven by asymmetries in the data.",
        "The result is a bias toward simplicity.",
        "We see this as an advantage in that the simplicity preference stems from the form of the architecture and learning mechanism.",
        "(iii) Word-by-word parsing and grammar selection occur as part of a single process?the network updates its weights every time it processes a word and this results in the formation of a parsing system.",
        "We see this as an advantage in that the moment-to-moment interaction of the system with data resembles the circumstances of a learning child.",
        "On the other hand, there has long been a serious difficulty with the network approach: the network dynamics and solutions have been very opaque to analysis.",
        "Although the systems sometimes learn well and capture data effectively, they are not scientifically very revealing unless we can interpret them.",
        "The Bayesian grammar-selection approach is much stronger in this regard: the formal properties of the grammars employed are well understood and the selection process is well-grounded in statistical theory?e.g., Griffiths et al. (2010).",
        "Here, we take advantage of recent formal results indicating how recurrent neural networks can encode abstract recursive structure (Moore, 1998; Pollack, 1987; Siegelmann, 1999; Tabor, 2000) An essential insight is that the network can use a spatial recursive structure, a fractal, to encode the temporal recursive structure of a symbol sequence.",
        "When the network is trained on short sentences exhibiting a few levels of embedding, it tends to generalize to higher levels of embedding, suggesting that it is not merely shaping itself to the training data, but discovers an abstract principle (Rodriguez et al., 1999; Rodriguez, 2001; Tabor, 2003; Wiles and Elman, 1995).",
        "During the course of learning, the fractal comes into being gradually in such a way that lower-order finite-state approximations to the recursion develop before higher-order structure does?a complexity cline phenomenon (Tabor, 2003).",
        "We examined human and neural network learning of a recursive language with an artificial grammar paradigm, the Box Prediction paradigm.",
        "Whereas our previous investigations of this task (Cho et al., 2011) focused on counting recursion languages (only a single stack symbol is required to track the recursive dependencies), we provide evidence here for mirror recursion learning by a few participants (multiple stack symbols required).",
        "We show how the theory of fractal grammars can be used to hand wire a network that processes the recursive language of our task.",
        "We then provide evidence that a Simple Recurrent Network (Elman, 1990; Elman, 1991), trained on the same task, also develops a fractal encoding.",
        "Moreover, the network shows evidence of a embodying a complexity-cline?similarly complex grammars are adjacent in the parameter space.",
        "An individual differences analysis indicates that a similar pattern arises in the humans.",
        "We conclude that the network encodings can be formally related to symbolic recursive models, but are different in that learning occurs by continuous grammar metamorphosis."

To see if the SRN's complexity cline predictions are in line with those of the FLNNs, we correlated the network's performance at the end of the Training Phase with its performance in the Test Phase.",

        "80% is the level of correct performance that a particular finite-state device we refer to as the ?Simple Markov Model?",
        "would yield during these 100 trials.",
        "The Simple Markov Model predicts 2 after 1, 3 after 2, 4 after 3, and 1 after 4.",
        "The two top scorers among these twelve generalized perfectly to each first instance of the four Level 3 types in the test phase.",
        "If, contrary to our hypothesis, all 12 were using finite state mechanisms, and they guessed randomly on novel transitions, the chances of observing 2 or more perfect scorers would be 0.9% (p = .009).",
        "We take this as evidence that the two strongest generalizers developed a representation closely approximating a recursive system.",
        "Performance at the end of training correlated with accuracy on 24 novel transitions in Level 3 sentences at test (r(69) = 0.72, p < .0001).",
        "This corresponds to test (a) of the SRN Results section above, suggesting some kind of grammar proximity model.",
        "Regarding (b), accuracy on the 8 novel transitions in 2This is not single-trial learning.",
        "It is immediate generalization to unseen cases.",
        "the 4 first instances of novel Level 3 sentences also correlated with the performance at the end of training, r(69) = 0.57, p < .0001.",
        "These results lend some empirical support to the complexity cline predictions of the fractal model."

        "The complexity cline prediction was also borne out by the human data: not only did performance on lower levels of embedding correlate with performance on higher levels of embedding, but it predicted generalization behavior, suggesting that the representation continuously metamorphoses from a finite-state system into an infinite state system.",

        "We suggest that further exploration of the relationship between the Bayesian models and the recurrent neural network models will be helpful.",
        "A novel claim of the present work is that they it is possible to compare recurrent neural network models and symbolic structure models on the same terms.",
        "We suggest that further examination of this relationship may be helpful in addressing the challenging problems of complex language learning."
