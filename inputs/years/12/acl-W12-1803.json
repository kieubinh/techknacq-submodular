        "Still, evaluations are individual undertakings in most areas, as common metrics and procedures which would be applicable for a range of systems are sparse.",

        "Common metrics for quantifying user and system interaction behavior and perceived quality ?",

        "Whereas early assessment and evaluation cycles were based on ad-hoc selected metrics, approaches have been made to come up with a standard set of metrics for quantifying interactions between users and systems which would make evaluation exercises comparable.",
        "The International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) has standardized two sets of metrics: ITU-T Suppl.",
        "24 to P-Series (2005) for spoken dialog systems, and ITU-T Suppl.",
        "25 to P-Series Rec.",
        "(2011) for multimodal dialog systems.",
        "These metrics describe system performance (e.g. in terms of error rates) and user/system interaction behavior (e.g. in terms of meta-communication acts, durations) in a quantitative way, and can thus serve as an input to the models discussed below.",
        "Input is welcome to stabilize these metrics, so that they are of more use to researchers and system developers.",
        "The proper conjunction between such metrics and standardized annotation schemes (e.g., Bunt et al., 2010) will strengthen the establishment and spreading of a specific set of metrics.",
        "When it comes to user-perceived quality, Hone and Graham (2000) have made a first attempt to come up with a validated questionnaire (SASSI), which, however, lacks a scale to assess speech output quality.",
        "The approach has been put forward in ITU-T Rec.",
        "P.851 (2003) by including speech output and dialog managing capabilities.",
        "A framework structure was preferred over a fixed (and validated) questionnaire, in order to more flexibly address the needs of researchers and developers.",
        "This approach still needs to be extended towards multimodal systems, where modality appropriateness, preference and perceived performance have to be considered.",
        "ITU-T welcomes contributions on this topic.",
        "For practical usage, it is desirable to have evaluation methods which provide diagnostic value to the system developer, so that the sources of misbe-havior can be identified.",
        "The diagnosis can be based on perceptual dimensions (effectiveness, efficiency, mental effort, etc.)",
        "or on technical characteristics (error rates, vocabulary coverage, etc.)",

        "The first approach to predict user judgments on the basis of interaction metrics is the well-known PARADISE model (Walker et al., 1997).",
        "The main challenge to date is the low generalizability of such models.",
        "The reason is that many of the underlying input parameters are interdependent, and that a simple linear combination does not account for more complex relationships (e.g. there might be an optimum length for a dialog, which cannot be easily described by a purely linear model).",
        "However, other algorithms such as non-linear regression, classification trees or Markov models, have not shown a significantly improved performance (M?ller et al., 2008; Engelbrecht, 2011).",
        "The latter are however adequate to describe the evolution of user opinion during the dialog, and thus might have principled advantages over models which use aggregated interaction performance metrics as an input."

        "During system development, it would be useful to anticipate how users would interact with a dialog system.",

        "Whereas user behavior simulation has frequently been used for training statistical dialog managers, only few approaches are documented which apply them to system evaluation.",
        "Early approaches mainly selected possible utterances from a set of collected data.",
        "The MeMo workbench (Engelbrecht, 2011) tried to combine statistical selection of probable interaction paths with the knowledge of usability experts about what typically influences user behavior.",
        "Such knowledge can also be generated by a conversational analysis and categorization (Schmidt et al., 2010).",
        "A different approach has been followed in the SpeechEval project (M?ller et al., 2009) where statistical dialog managers have been trained on a large diverse dataset to generate utterances on a conceptual level.",
        "The system is then amended with ASR and TTS to allow for a speech-based black-box interaction with telephone-based dialog systems.",
        "Combined with diagnostic quality prediction models, such tools can support system developers to evaluate different dialog strategies early in the design cycle and at low costs, and thus avoid dissatisfied users.",
        "The approach still has to be extended towards multimodal dialog systems."
