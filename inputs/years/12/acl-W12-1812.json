        "In dialog systems, belief tracking refers to maintaining a distribution over multiple dialog states as a dialog progresses.",
        "Belief tracking is desirable because it provides robustness to errors in speech recognition, which can be quite common.",
        "This distribution can be modeled in a variety of ways, including heuristic scores (Higashinaka et al., 2003), Bayesian networks (Paek and Horvitz, 2000; Williams and Young, 2007), and discriminative models (Bohus and Rudnicky, 2006).",
        "Techniques have been fielded which scale to realistically sized dialog problems and operate in real time (Young et al., 2009; Thomson and Young, 2010; Williams, 2010; Mehta et al., 2010).",
        "In lab settings, belief tracking has been shown to improve overall system performance (Young et al., 2009; Thomson and Young, 2010).",
        "Despite this progress, there are still important unresolved issues.",
        "For example, a deployment with real callers (Williams, 2011) found that belief tracking sometimes degraded performance due to model mismatches that are difficult to anticipate at training time.",
        "What is lacking is a careful comparison of methods to determine their relative strengths, in terms of generalization, sample efficiency, speed, etc.",
        "This position paper argues for a belief tracking challenge task.",
        "A corpus of labeled dialogs and scoring code would be released.",
        "Research teams would enter one or more belief tracking algorithms, which would be evaluated on a held-out test set."

    {
      "heading": "2 Corpus",
      "text": [
        "The Spoken dialog challenge corpus is an attractive corpus for this challenge.",
        "It consists of phone calls from real (not simulated) bus riders with real (not imagined) information needs.",
        "There have been 2 rounds of the challenge (2010, and 2011-2012), with 3 systems in each round.",
        "The rounds differed in scope and (probably) user population.",
        "A total of 3 different teams entered systems, using different dialog designs, speech recognizers, and audio output.",
        "For each system in each round, 500-1500 dialogs were logged.",
        "While it would be ideal if the corpus included more complex interactions such as negotiations, as a publicly available corpus it is unparalleled in terms of size, realism, and system diversity.",
        "There are limitations to a challenge based on this corpus: it would not allow comparisons across domains, nor for multi-modal or situated dialog.",
        "These aspects could be left for a future challenge.",
        "Another possible objection is that off-line experiments would not measure end-to-end impact on a real dialog system; however, we do know that good belief tracking improves dialog performance (Young",
        "et al, 2009; Thomson and Young, 2010; Williams, 2011), so characterizing and improving belief tracking seems a logical next step.",
        "Moreover, building an end-to-end dialog system is a daunting task, out of reach of many research teams without specific funding.",
        "A corpus-based challenge has a much lower barrier to entry."

      "heading": "3 Evaluation issues",
      "text": [
        "There are many (not one!)",
        "metrics to evaluate.",
        "It is crucial to design these in advance and implement them as computer programs for use during development.",
        "Specific metrics could draw on the following core concepts.",
        "Baseline accuracy measures the speech recognition 1-best ?",
        "i.e., accuracy without belief tracking.",
        "1-best accuracy measures how often the belief tracker's 1-best hypothesis is correct.",
        "Mean reciprocal rank measures the quality of the ordering of the belief state, ignoring the probabilities used to order; log-likelihood measures the quality of the probabilities.",
        "ROC curves measure the 1-best discrimination of the belief tracker at different false-accept rates, or at the equal error rate.",
        "An important question is at which turns to assess the accuracy of the belief in a slot.",
        "For example, accuracy could be measured at every turn; every turn after a slot is first mentioned; only turns where a slot is mentioned; only turns where a slot appears in the speech recognition result; and so on.",
        "Depending on the evaluation metric, it may be necessary to annotate dialogs for the user's goal, which could be done automatically or manually.",
        "Another issue is how to automatically determine whether a belief state value is correct at the semantic level.",
        "A final question is how to divide the corpus into a training and test set in a way that measures robustness to the different conditions.",
        "Perhaps some of the data from the second round (which has not yet been released) could be held back for evaluation."

      "heading": "4 Next steps",

        "The next step is to form a group of interested researchers to work through the issues above, particularly for the preparation of the corpus and evaluation methodology.",
        "Once this is documented and agreed, code to perform the evaluation can be developed, and additional labelling (if needed) can be started."
