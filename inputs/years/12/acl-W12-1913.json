        "Most unsupervised dependency systems rely on gold-standard Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags, either directly, using the PoS tags instead of words, or indirectly in the back-off mechanism of fully lexicalized models (Headden et al., 2009).",
        "It has been shown in supervised systems that using a hierarchical syntactic structure model can produce competitive sequence models; in other words that a parser can be a good tagger (Li et al., 2011; Auli and Lopez, 2011; Cohen et al., 2011).",
        "This is unsurprising, as the parser uses a rich set of hierarchical features that enable it to look at a less localized environment than a PoS tagger which in most cases relies solely on local contextual features.",
        "However this interaction has not been shown for the unsupervised setting.",
        "To our knowledge, this work is the first to show that using dependencies for unsupervised PoS induction is indeed useful."

        "Although most unsupervised systems depend on gold-standard PoS information, they can also be used in a fully unsupervised pipeline.",
        "One reason for doing so is to use dependency parsing as an extrinsic evaluation for unsupervised PoS induction (Headden et al., 2008).",
        "As discussed in that paper (and also by Klein and Manning (2004)) the quality of the dependencies drops with the use of induced tags.",
        "One way of producing better PoS tags is to use the dependency parser's output to influence the PoS inducer, thus turning the pipeline into a loop.",
        "The main difficulty of this approach is to find a way of incorporating dependency information into a PoS induction system.",
        "In previous work",
        "(Christodoulopoulos et al., 2011) we have described BMMM: a PoS induction system that makes it is easy to incorporate multiple features either at the type or token level.",
        "For the dependency induction system we chose the DMV model of Klein and Manning (2004) because of its simplicity and its popularity.",
        "Both systems are described briefly in section 3.",
        "Using these two systems we performed an iterated learning experiment.",

        "(Smith et al., 2003).",
        "Here we treat the two systems as the individuals1 that influence each other in successive generations starting from a run of the original BMMM system without dependency information (fig.",
        "1).",
        "We start with a run of the basic BMMM system using just context and morphology features (generation 0) and use the output to train the DMV.",
        "To complete the first generation, we then use the induced dependencies as features (as described in section 4) for a new run of the BMMM system.",
        "As there is no single objective function, this setup 1This is not directly analogous to the language evolution notion of iterated learning; here instead of a single type of individual we have two separate systems that learn/model different representations.",
        "does not guarantee that either the quality of PoS tags or the dependencies will improve after each generation.",
        "However, in practice this iterated learning approach works well (as we discuss in section 4)."
