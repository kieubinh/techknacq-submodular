        "Note that Google Translate does not currently provide a way to perform such selective translation.",
        "However, other open-source SMT systems such as Moses8 and Joshua9 do.",
        "Furthermore, it might also be useful to exploit n-best translation outputs instead of just relying on the 1-best as we currently do.",
        "As an alternative to selective translation, one could simply extract the identified errorful spans and round-trip translate each of them individually.",
        "For example, consider the sentence: ?Most of all, luck is null prep no use without a hard work.?",
        "where the preposition of is omitted and there is an extraneous article a before ?hard work?.",
        "With this approach, one would simply provide Google Translate with the two phrasal spans containing the errors, instead of the entire sentence.",
        "More generally, although we use Google Translate for this pilot study due to its easy availability, it might be more practical and useful to rely on an in-house SMT system that trades-off translation quality for additional features.",
        "We also found that the language-model based techniques performed quite poorly compared to the other techniques.",
        "We suspect that this is due to the fact that Google Translate already employs large-order language models trained on trillions of words.",
        "Using lower-order models trained on much smaller corpora might simply introduce noise.",
        "However, a detailed analysis is certainly warranted.",
        "In conclusion, we claim that our preliminary exploration of large-scale round-trip translation based techniques yielded fairly reasonable results.",
        "However, more importantly, it makes it clear that, with",
        "tial to be very effective at whole-sentence grammatical error correction."
