        "However, EFL learners have difficulty paraphrasing in their writing partly",
        "because of their insufficient lexical knowledge (Abasi et al. 2006; Chandrasoma et al. 2004).",
        "If they are provided with direct and substantial support while writing, they may be able to express their thoughts more fluently.",
        "Unfortunately, few paraphrase reference tools have been developed to provide instant assistance to learners in their writing process.",
        "In the light of the pressing need for paraphrase reference tools, we develop PREFER, a paraphrasing assistant system to help EFL learners vary their expression during writing.",
        "Over the past decade, paraphrasing techniques have played an important role in many areas of Natural Language Processing, such as machine translation, and question answering.",
        "However, very few studies have been conducted concerning the application of automatic paraphrase generation techniques in language learning and teaching.",
        "In this paper, we treat the paraphrase generation problem as a graph-related problem.",
        "We adopt the PageRank algorithm (Page et al., 1999) to generate paraphrases based on the assumption that a page with more incoming links is likely to receive a higher rank.",
        "Meanwhile, a page which is linked by a higher ranked page should transitively be ranked higher.",
        "We take advantage of transitivity of relevance to rank and filter the paraphrases generated by the pivot-based method (i.e., phrase are treated as paraphrases if they share the same translations) of Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005).",
        "The advantage of the pivot approach is that the generated paraphrases are exactly semantically equivalent to the query phrase.",
        "However, its",
        "quality of the paraphrases highly correlates with that of the techniques of bilingual alignment.",
        "To overcome such limitation, we use the PageRank algorithm to refine the generated paraphrases.",
        "In other words, we leverage the PageRank algorithm to find more relevant paraphrases that preserve both meaning and grammaticality for language learners.",
        "The results of a manual evaluation and a system assessment show that our approach and system perform well."
