        "In SLA research, a range of measures have been proposed to study the development of complexity in the language produced by learners.",
        "These measures are used to evaluate the oral or written production abilities of language learners.",

        "Since we want to classify and retrieve texts for learners of different age groups, we hypothesized that these SLA-based complexity measures of learner production, when used as features for readability classification will improve the performance of the classifiers.",

        "Considering the 25 syntactic features alone, the 10 most predictive features were: (MLS, CoOrd, DC/C, CN/C, CP/C, NumPP, VPSize, C/T, CN/T and NumVP), referred to as BEST10SYN in the table.",
        "The 10 most predictive features amongst all the lexical features were: (NumChar, NumSyll, AWL, ModV, AdvV, AdjV, LV, VV1, NV and SVV1).",
        "They are referred to as BEST10LEX in the table.",
        "Although the traditionally used features (NumChar, NumSyll, MLS) seem to be the most predictive, it can be seen from the other top ranked features, that there is significant overlap between the best features identified by WEKA and the features which Lu (2010; 2011b) identified as correlating best with language development (shown in italics in Table 3 and Table 4), which supports our hypothesis that the SLA-based measures are useful features for readability classification of non-learner text too."

        "Table 5 shows the results of our classification experiments using WEKA's Multi-Layer Perceptron algorithm with different combinations of features.",
        "Combining all features results in the best accuracy of 93.3%, which is a large improvement over the current state of the art in readability classification reported on the WeeklyReader corpus (74.01% by Feng et al., 2010).",
        "It should, however, be kept",
        "in mind that the improvement is achieved on the WeeBit corpus which is an extension of the WeeklyReader corpus previously used.",
        "Interestingly, the result of 89.7% for BEST10ALL, the top 10 features chosen by the WEKA ranker, are quite close to our best result, with a very small number of features.",
        "Lexical features seem to perform better than syntactic features when considered separately.",
        "However, this better performance of lexical features was mainly due to the addition of the traditionally used features NumChar and NumSyll.",
        "So it is no wonder that these shallow features have been used in the traditional readability formulae for such a long time; but the predictive power of the traditional formulae as features by themselves is poor (38.8%), in line with the conclusions drawn in previous research (Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005; Feng et al., 2010) about the Flesch-Kincaid and Dale-Chall formulae.",
        "Interestingly, Coleman, which was not considered in those previous approaches, was ranked among the Top-10 most predictive features by the WEKA ranker.",
        "So it holds a good predictive power when used as one of the features for the classifier.",
        "We also studied the impact of SLA based features alone on readability classification.",
        "The performance of the SLA based lexical features (SLALEX) and syntactic features (SLASYN) when considered separately are still in a comparable range with the previously reported results on readability classification (68.1% and 71.2% respectively).",
        "However, combining both of them resulted in an accuracy of 82.3%, which is a considerable improvement over previously reported results.",
        "It again adds weight to the initial hypothesis that SLA based features can be useful for readability classification."

        "To address this issue, we explored two avenues.",

        "A summary of the results can be seen in Table 6.",
        "Our approach with 46 features results in 91.3% accuracy on the WeeklyReader corpus, compared to 74.01% as the best previous WeeklyReader result, reported by Feng et al. (2010) for their much larger feature set (122 features).",
        "In order to verify the impact of our choice of features, we also did a replication of the parsed syntactic feature measures reported by (Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005) on the WeeklyReader corpus and obtained essentially the same accuracy as the one pub",
        "lished (50.7% vs. 50.91%), supporting the comparability of the WeeklyReader data used.",
        "The significant performance increase we reported thus seems to be due to the new features we integrated from the SLA literature.",
        "Secondly, we were interested in the impact of the training size on the results.",
        "We therefore investigated how good our best approach (using all features) is on a training corpus that is comparable to the WeeklyReader corpus used in previous work in terms of the number of documents per class.",
        "When we took 1400 WeeklyReader documents distributed into four classes as described in Feng et al. (2010), we obtained an accuracy of 84.2%, compared to the 74.01% they reported as best result.",
        "Using 2500 documents distributed into four classes as in Petersen and Ostendorf (2009) we obtained 88.4%, compared to their best result of 63.18%.",
        "Given that the original corpora used are not available, these WeeklyReader corpora with the same source, number of documents, and size of classes are as close as we can get to a direct comparison.",
        "In the future, the availability of the WeeBit corpus will support a more direct comparison of approaches.",

        "We created a new corpus, WeeBit, by combining texts from two graded web sources WeeklyReader and BBC Bitesize.",
        "The resulting text corpus is larger and covers more grade levels, spanning the age group between 7 and 16 years.",
        "We hope that the availability of this graded corpus will be useful as an empirical basis for future studies in automatic readability assessment.13 We studied the impact of various lexical and syntactic features and explored their performance in combination with features encoding syntactic complexity and lexical richness that were inspired by Second Language Acquisition research.",
        "Our experiments show that not only the full set of features, but 13As mentioned above, we will make the WeeBit corpus available to all researchers who have obtained the inexpensive research license from WeeklyReader.",
        "also specific manually or automatically selected subsets of features provide results significantly improving on the previously published state of the art in automatic readability assessment.",
        "There also seems to be a clear correlation between the good predictors according to SLA research on language learning and those that performed well in text classification.",
        "Although the exact criteria based on which the individual corpora (WeeklyReader, BBC-Bitesize) were created is not known, it is possible that they were created with the well-known, traditional readability formulae in mind.",
        "It would be surprising if the two corpora, compiled in the US and Britain by different companies, were created with the same set of measures in mind, so the WeeBit corpus should be less affected.",
        "Still, it is possible that the reason the traditional features NumChar, NumSyll and MLS held such a strong predictive power is that these measures were considered when the texts were written.",
        "But removing these traditional features only strengthens the role of the other features and thereby the main point of the paper arguing for the usefuless of SLA developmental measures for readability classification.",
        "As a part of our future work, we intend to revisit and study the impact of further classes of features employed in psycholinguistics and cognitive science research, such as those studied in Coh-Metrix (Graesser et al., 2004) or in the context of retrieving texts for specific groups of readers (Feng, 2010).",
        "In terms of our overall application goal, we are currently studying the ability of the classification models we built to generalize to web data.",
        "We then plan to add the classification model to a language aware search engine (Ott and Meurers, 2010).",
        "Such a search engine may then also be able to integrate user feedback on the readability levels of webpages, to build a dynamic, online model of readability."
