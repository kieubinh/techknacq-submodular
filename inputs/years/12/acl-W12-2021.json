        "competence in vocabulary usage.",
        "Spoken language assessments typically measure multiple dimensions of language ability.",
        "Overall proficiency in the target language can be assessed by testing the abilities in various areas including fluency, pronunciation, and intonation; grammar and vocabulary; and discourse structure.",
        "With the recent move toward the objective assessment of language ability (spoken and written), it is imperative that we develop methods for quantifying these abilities and measuring them automatically.",
        "A majority of the studies in automated speech scoring have focused on fluency (Cucchiarini et al., 2000; Cucchiarini et al., 2002), pronunciation (Witt and Young, 1997; Witt, 1999; Franco et al., 1997; Neumeyer et al., 2000), and intonation (Zechner et al., 2011).",
        "More recently, Chen and Yoon (2011) and Chen and Zechner (2011) have measured syntactic competence in speech scoring.",
        "However, only a few have explored features related to vocabulary usage and they have been limited to type-token ratio (TTR) related features (e.g., Lu (2011)).",
        "In addition, Bernstein et al. (2010) developed vocabulary features that measure the similarity between the vocabulary in the test responses and the vocabulary in the pre-collected texts in the same topic.",
        "However, their features assessed content and topicality, not vocabulary usage.",
        "The speaking construct of vocabulary usage comprises two sub-constructs: sophistication and precision.",
        "The aspect of vocabulary that we intend to measure in this paper is that of lexical sophistication, also termed lexical diversity and lexical richness in second language studies.",
        "Measures of lexical sophistication attempt to quantify the degree to which a varied and large vocabulary is used (Laufer and Nation, 1995).",
        "In order to assess the degree of lex",
        "ical sophistication, we employ a vocabulary profile-based approach (partly motivated from the results of a previous study, as will be explained in Section 2).",
        "By a vocabulary profile, it is meant that the frequency of each vocabulary item is calculated from a reference corpus covering the language variety of the target situation.",
        "The degree of lexical sophistication is captured by the word frequency - low frequency words are considered to be more difficult, and therefore more sophisticated.",
        "We then design features that capture the difficulty level of vocabulary items in test takers?",
        "responses.",
        "Finally, we perform correlation analyses between these new features and human proficiency scores and assess the feature's importance with respect to the other features in an automatic scoring module.",
        "The novelty of this study lies in the use of vocabulary profile in an automatic scoring set-up to assess lexical sophistication.",
        "This paper will proceed as follows: we will review related work in Section 2.",
        "Data and experiment setup will be explained in Section 3 and Section 4.",
        "Next, we will present the results in Section 5, discuss them in Section 6, and conclude with a summary of the importance of our findings in Section 7."

        "Measures of lexical richness have been the focus of several studies involving assessment of L1 and L2 language abilities (Laufer and Nation, 1995; Vermeer, 2000; Daller et al., 2003; Kormos and Denes, 2004).",
        "The types of measures considered in these studies can be grouped into quantitative and qualitative measures.",
        "The quantitative measures give insight into the number of words known, but do not distinguish them from one another based on their category or frequency in language use.",
        "They have evolved to make up for the widely applied measure type-token-ratio (TTR).",
        "However, owing to its sensitivity to the number of tokens, TTR has been considered as an unstable measure in differing proficiency levels of language learners.",
        "The Guiraud index, Uber index, and Herdan index (Vermeer, 2000; Daller et al., 2003; Lu, 2011) are some measures in this category mostly derived from TTR as either simpler transformations of the TTR or its scaled versions to ameliorate the effect of differing token cardinalities.",
        "Qualitative measures, on the other hand, distinguish themselves from those derived from TTR since they take into account distinctions between words such as their parts of speech or difficulty levels.",
        "Adding a qualitative dimension gives more insight into lexical aspects of language ability than the purely quantitative measures such as TTR-based measures.",
        "Some measures in this category include a derived form of the limiting relative diversity (LRD) given by ?",
        "D(verbs)/D(nouns) using the D-measure proposed in (Malvern and Richards, 1997), Lexical frequency profile (LFP) (Laufer and Nation, 1995) and P-Lex (Meara and Bell, 2003).",
        "LFP uses a vocabulary profile (VP) for a given body of written text or spoken utterance and gives the percentage of words used at different frequency levels (such as from the one-thousand most common words, the next thousand most common words) where the words themselves come from a pre-compiled vocabulary list, such as the Academic Word List (AWL) with its associated frequency distribution on words by Coxhead(1998).",
        "Frequency level refers to a class of words (or appropriately chosen word units) that are grouped based on their frequencies of actual usage in corpora.",
        "P-Lex is another approach that uses the frequency level of the words to assess lexical richness.",
        "These measures are based on the differing frequencies of lexical items and hence rely on the availability of frequency lists for the language being considered.",
        "These two different types of measures have been used in the analysis of essays written by second language learners of English (ESL).",
        "Laufer and Nation (1995) have shown that LFP correlates well with an independent measure of vocabulary knowledge and that it is possible to categorize learners according to different proficiency levels using this measure.",
        "In another study seeking to understand the extent to which VP based on students?",
        "essays predicted their academic performance (Morris and Cobb, 2004), it was observed that students?",
        "vocabulary profile results correlated significantly with their grades.",
        "Additionally, VP was found to be indicative of finer distinctions in the language skills of high proficiency nonnative speakers than oral interviews can cover.",
        "Furthermore, these measures have been employed in automated essay scoring.",
        "Attali and Burstein",
        "(2006) used average word frequency and average word length in characters across the words in the essay.",
        "In addition to the average word frequency measure, the average word length measure was implemented to assess the average difficulty of the word used in the essay under the assumption that the words with more characters were more difficult than the words with fewer characters.",
        "These features showed promising performance in estimating test takers?",
        "proficiency levels.",
        "In contrast to qualitative measures, quantitative measures did not achieve promising performance.",
        "Vermeer (2000) showed that quantitative measures achieve neither the validity nor the reliability of the measures, regardless of the transformations and corrections.",
        "More recently, the relationship of lexical richness to ESL learners?",
        "speaking task performance has been studied by Lu (2011).",
        "The comprehensive study was aimed at measuring lexical richness along the three dimensions of lexical density, sophistication, and variation, using 25 different metrics (belonging to both the qualitative and quantitative categories above) available in the language acquisition literature.",
        "His results, based on the manual transcription of a spoken corpus of English learners, indicate that a) lexical variation (the number of word types) correlated most strongly with the raters?",
        "judg-ments of the quality of ESL learners?",
        "oral narratives, b) lexical sophistication only had a very small effect, and c) lexical density (indicative of proportion of lexical words) in an oral narrative did not appear to relate to its quality.",
        "In this study, we seek to quantify vocabulary usage in terms of measures of lexical sophistication: VP based on a set of reference word lists.",
        "The novelty of the current study lies in the use of VP as a measure of lexical sophistication for spoken language assessment.",
        "It derives support from other studies (Morris and Cobb, 2004; Laufer and Nation, 1995) but is carried out in a completely different context, that of automatic scoring of proficiency levels in spontaneous speech, an area not explored thus far in existing literature.",
        "Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the genre of the reference corpus on the performance of these lexical measures.",
        "For this purpose, three different corpora will be used to generate reference frequency levels.",
        "Finally, we will investigate how the characteristics of the item types influence the performance of these measures."

        "In general, we found that the test takers used a fairly small number of vocabulary items in the spoken responses.",
        "On average, the total types used in the responses was 87.21 for IND items and 98.52 for INT items.",
        "Furthermore, the proportions of high frequency words on test takers?",
        "spoken responses were markedly high.",
        "The proportion of top-100 words was almost 50% and the proportion of top1500 words (summation of TOP1-TOP4) was over 89% on average.",
        "This means that only 1500 words represent almost 90% of the active vocabulary of the test takers in their spontaneous speech.",
        "Figure 1 presents the average TOP1-TOP6 features across all proficiency levels.",
        "The values of INT items were similar to IND items, but the TOP3-TOP6 values were slightly higher than IND items; INT items tended to include more low frequency words.",
        "In order to investigate the impact of the higher proportion of low frequency words in INT items, we selected two features (aFreq and TOP1) and further analyzed them.",
        "Table 9 provides the mean of aFreq and TOP1 for each score level.",
        "The features were generated using AEST as a reference.",
        "score level On average, the differences between adjacent score levels in INT items were smaller than those in IND items.",
        "The weaker distinction between score levels may result in the lower performance of vocabulary profile features in INT items.",
        "Particularly, the differences were smaller in lower score levels (2- 4) than in higher score levels (5-8).",
        "The relatively high proportion of low frequency words in the low score level reduced the predictive power of vocabulary profile features.",
        "This difference between the item-types strongly supports item-type-specific modeling.",
        "We combined the IND and INT item responses and computed a correlation between the features and the proficiency scores over the entirety of data sets.",
        "Despite increase in sample sizes, the correlations were lower than both the corresponding correlations of the IND items and the INT items.",
        "For instance, the correlation of the T2K-SWAL-based aFreq feature was?0.393, and that of the AEST databased aFreq was?0.50, which was approximately 3% lower than the INT items and 10% lower than the IND items.",
        "The difference in the vocabulary distributions between the two item-types decreased the performance",
        "of the features.",
        "In this study, AEST databased features outperformed T2K-SWAL-based features.",
        "Although no items in the evaluation data overlapped with items in AEST data, the similarity in the speakers?",
        "proficiency levels and task types might have resulted in a better match between the vocabulary and its distributions of AEST data with AEST balanced data, finally the AEST databased features achieved the best performance.",
        "In order to explore the degree to which AEST balanced data (test responses) and the reference corpora matched, we calculated the proportion of word types that occurred in test responses and reference corpora (the coverage of reference list).",
        "The ASR hypotheses of AEST balanced data comprised 6,024 word types.",
        "GSL covered 73%, T2K-SWAL covered 99%, and AEST data covered close to 100%.",
        "Considering the fact that, a) despite high coverage of both T2K-SWAL and AEST data, T2K-SWALbased features achieved much lower performance than AEST data, and, b) despite huge differences in the coverage between T2K-SWAL and GSL, the performance of features based on these reference corpora were comparable, coverage was not likely to have been a factor having a strong impact on the performance.",
        "The large differences in the performance of TOP1 across reference lists support the possibility of the strong influence of high frequency word types on proficiency; the kinds of word types that were in the TOP1 bins were an important factor that influenced the performance of vocabulary profile features.",
        "Finally, genre differences (spoken texts vs. written texts) in reference corpora did not have strong impact on the predictive ability of the features; the performance of features based on written reference corpus (GSL) were comparable to those based on a spoken reference corpus (T2K-SWAL).",
        "Despite the high correlation shown by the individual features (such as aFreq), we do not see a corresponding increase in the performance of the scoring model with all the best performing features.",
        "The most likely explanation to this is the small training data size; in each fold, only about 380 responses for IND and about 760 responses for INT were used in the scoring model training.",
        "Another possibility is overlap with the existing features; the aspect that vocabulary profile features are modeling may be already covered to some extent in existing feature set.",
        "In future research, we will further investigate this aspect in details."

        "In general, vocabulary profile features showed strong correlations with human proficiency scores, but when used in an automatic scoring model in combination with an existing set of predictors of language proficiency, the augmented feature set showed marginal improvement in predicting human-assigned scores of proficiency."
