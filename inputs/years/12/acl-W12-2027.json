        "Some grammatical error detection methods, including the ones currently used by the Educational Testing Service's e-rater system (At-tali and Burstein, 2006), are tuned for precision because of the perceived high cost of false positives (i.e., marking fluent English as ungrammatical).",
        "Precision, however, is not optimal for all tasks, particularly the HOO 2012 Shared Task on grammatical errors, which uses F-score for evaluation.",

        "The detection of grammatical errors is a challenging problem that, arguably, requires the use of both linguistic knowledge (e.g., in the form of rules or complex features) and large corpora for statistical learning.",
        "Additionally, grammatical error detection can be applied in various scenarios (e.g., automated essay scoring, writing assistance, language learning), many of which may benefit from task-specific adaptation or tuning.",
        "For example, one might want to take a different approach when detecting errors for the purpose of providing feedback than when detecting errors to evaluate the quality of writing in an essay.",
        "Thus, it seems desirable to take a flexible approach to grammatical error detection that incorporates multiple, complementary techniques.",
        "In this paper, we extend the preposition and determiner error detection modules currently used in the Educational Testing Service's e-rater automated essay scoring system (Attali and Burstein, 2006) for the HOO 2012 Shared Task on grammatical errors (?2).",
        "We refer to this set of modules from e-rater as our ?base system?",
        "(?3).",
        "While the base system uses statistical methods to learn models of grammatical English, it also leverages substantial amounts of linguistic knowledge in the form of various hand-coded filters and complex syntactic features.",
        "The base system is also tuned for high precision at the expense of recall in order to avoid a high rate of potentially costly false positives (i.e., frequent marking of correct English sentences as ungrammatical).",
        "We apply the pre-existing base system without modifications but complement it with a large-scale n-gram method (?5) based on work by Bergsma et al.",
        "(2009).",
        "The n-gram method employs very little linguistic knowledge and instead relies almost exclusively upon corpus statistics.",
        "We also tune the resulting hybrid system with labeled training data in order to maximize the primary evaluation metric used in the HOO 2012 Shared Task: balanced F-score, or F1 (?6).",
        "We find that the tuned hybrid system improves upon the recall and F-score of the base system.",
        "Also, in the HOO 2012 Shared Task, the hybrid system achieved results that were competitive with other submitted grammatical error detection systems (?7)."

        "), determiner selection errors (?RD?",
        "), extraneous determiners (?UD?",
        "), and missing determiners (?MD?).",
        "For training and testing data, the shared task uses short essays from an examination for speakers of English as a foreign language.",
        "The data includes gold standard human annotations identifying preposition and determiner errors.",
        "These errors are represented as edits that transform an ungrammatical text into a grammatical one.",
        "Edits consist of start and end offsets into the original text and a correction string that should replace the original text at the specified offsets.",
        "The offsets differ by error type: word selection errors include just the word, extraneous word errors include an extra space after the word so that a blank will result in an appropriate amount of whitespace, and missing word errors specify spans of length zero.",
        "There are three subtasks: detection, recognition, and correction.",
        "Each is evaluated according to precision, recall, and F-score according to a set of gold standard edits produced by human annotation.",
        "While the correction subtask requires both correct character offsets and appropriate corrections, the detection and recognition subtasks only consider the offsets.",
        "Detection and recognition are essentially the same, except that detection allows for loose matching of offsets, which permits mismatches between the extraneous use (e.g., UT) and word selection (e.g., RT) error types.",
        "For our submission to the shared task, we chose to tune for the detection subtask, and we also chose to avoid the correction task entirely since the interface to the pre-existing base system did not give us access to possible corrections.",
        "a relatively rare occurrence, include a space before the word rather than after it.",

        "Figure 3 shows examples of errors detected by the n-gram system but missed by the base system.",
        "Example (3) shows an example of where the base system does not detect the extraneous preposition because it only searches for these in certain quantifier constructions.",
        "Example (4) contains a spelling error, which confuses the determiner error detection system.",
        "It has not seen the misspelling often enough to be able to reliably judge whether it needs an article or not before it, and so errs on the side of caution.",
        "When diffender is correctly spelled as defender, the base system does detect that there is a missing article in the sentence.",
        "There were a small number of cases where dialect caused a mismatch between our system's error predictions and the gold standard.",
        "For example, an hotel is not marked as an error in the gold standard since it is correct in many dialects.",
        "However, it was always corrected to a hotel by our system.",
        "Our system also often corrected determiners before the noun camp, since in American Standard English it is more usual to talk about going to Summer Camp rather than going to a/the Summer Camp.",
        "Although the task was to detect preposition and determiner errors in isolation, there was sometimes interference from other errors in the sentence.",
        "This impacted the task in two ways.",
        "Firstly, in a sentence",
        "with multiple errors, it was sometimes possible to correct it in multiple ways, not all of which involved preposition or determiner errors.",
        "For example, you could correct the phrase a women by either changing the a to the, deleting the a entirely or replacing women with woman.",
        "The last change would not fall under the category of determiner error, and so there was sometimes a mismatch between the corrections predicted by the system and the gold standard corrections.",
        "Secondly, the presence of multiple errors impacted the task when a gold standard correction depended on another error in the same sentence being corrected in a particular way.",
        "For example, you could correct I'm really excited to read the book.",
        "as I'm really excited about reading the book., however if you add the preposition about without correcting to read this correction results in the sentence becoming even more ungrammatical than the original.11"

      "text": [
        "In this paper, we have described a hybrid system for grammatical error detection that combines a pre-existing base system, which leverages detailed linguistic knowledge and produces high-precision output, with a large-scale n-gram approach, which relies almost exclusively on simple counting of n-grams in a massive corpus.",
        "Though the base system was not tuned at all for the HOO 2012 Shared Task, it performed well in the official evaluation.",
        "The two methods also complemented each other well: many of the predictions from one did not appear in the output of the other, and the F-score of the hybrid system was considerably higher than the scores for the individual methods."

        "11Many of these cases were addressed in the revised version of the gold standard data, however we feel that the issue is a more general one and deserves consideration in the design of future tasks."
