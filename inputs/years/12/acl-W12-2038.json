        "Reading texts in a second language presents the language learner with a number of comprehension problems, including the problem of interpreting words that are unknown or are used in unfamiliar ways.",
        "These problems are exacerbated by the prevalence of lexical ambiguity.",
        "Landes et al. (1998) report that more than half the content words in English texts are lexically ambiguous, with the most frequent words having a large number of meanings.",
        "The word face, for example, is listed in WordNet (Fell-baum, 1998) with twelve different nominal senses; although not all are equally prevalent, there is still much potential for confusion.",
        "To address this, we have designed an online reading assistant to provide sense-specific lexical information to readers.",
        "By sense-specific, we refer to information applicable only for one given sense (meaning) of a word.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the system design and whether such a system can be beneficial.",
        "Our experiment with learners illustrates the effectiveness of such information for vocabulary acquisition and reading comprehension.",
        "The problem of lexical ambiguity in reading comprehension is a significant one.",
        "While dictionaries can help improve comprehension and acquisition (see, e.g., Prichard, 2008), lexical ambiguity may lead to misunderstandings and unsuccessful vocabulary acquisition (Luppescu and Day, 1993), as learners may become confused when trying to locate an appropriate meaning for an unknown word among numerous sense entries.",
        "Luppescu and Day showed that readers who use a (printed) dictionary have improved comprehension and acquisition, but to the detriment of their reading speed.",
        "For electronic dictionaries as well, lexical ambiguity remains a problem (Koyama and Takeuchi, 2004; Laufer and Hill, 2000; Leffa, 1992; Prichard, 2008), as readers need specific information about a word as it is used in context in order to effectively comprehend the text and thus learn the word.",
        "Kulka-rni et al. (2008) demonstrated that providing readers with sense-specific information led learners to significantly better vocabulary acquisition than providing them with general word meaning information.",
        "We have developed an online system to provide vocabulary assistance to learners of English as a Second Language (ESL), allowing them to click on unfamiliar words and see lexical information?",
        "target word definitions and examples?relevant to that particular usage.",
        "We discuss previous online",
        "systems in section 2.",
        "Importantly, the examples we present are from the COBUILD dictionary (Sinclair, 2006), which is designed for language learners.",
        "To present these for any text, our system must map automatic word sense disambiguation (WSD) system output (using WordNet senses (Fellbaum, 1998)) to COBUILD, as covered in section 3, where we also describe general properties of the web system.",
        "The main contribution of this work is to investigate whether high-quality sense-specific lexical information presented in an intelligent reading system helps learners in their vocabulary acquisition and reading comprehension and to investigate the effect of automatic errors on learning.",
        "We accordingly ask the following research questions:",
        "1.",
        "Does sense-specific lexical information facilitate vocabulary acquisition to a greater extent than: a) no lexical information, and b) lexical information on all senses of each chosen word?",
        "2.",
        "Does sense-specific lexical information facili",
        "tate learners?",
        "reading comprehension?",

      "text": [
        "While there are many studies in second language acquisition (SLA) on providing vocabulary and reading assistance (e.g., Prichard, 2008; Luppescu and Day, 1993), we focus on outlining intelligent computer-assisted language learning (ICALL) systems here (see also discussion in Dela Rosa and Es-kenazi, 2011).",
        "Such systems hold the promise of alleviating some problems of acquiring words while reading by providing information specific to each word as it is used in context (Nerbonne and Smit, 1996; Kulkarni et al., 2008).",
        "The GLOSSER-RuG system (Nerbonne and Smit, 1996) disambiguates on the basis of part of speech (POS).",
        "This is helpful in distinguishing verbal and nominal uses, for example, but is, of course, ineffective when a word has more than one sense in the same POS (e.g., face).",
        "More effective is the REAP Tutor (Heilman et al., 2006), which uses word sense disambiguation to provide lexicographic information and has been shown to benefit learners by providing sense-specific lexical information (Dela Rosa and Eskenazi, 2011; Kulkarni et al., 2008).",
        "We build from this work by further demonstrating the utility of sense-specific information.",
        "What distinguishes our work is how we build from the notion that the lexical information provided needs to be tuned to the capacities of ESL learners.",
        "For example, definitions and illustrative examples should make use of familiar vocabulary if they are to aid language learners; example sentences directly taken from corpora or from the web seem less appropriate because the information in them might be less accessible (Groot, 2000; Kilgarriff et al., 2008; Segler et al., 2002).",
        "On the other hand, examples constructed by lexicographers for learner dictionaries typically control for syntactic and lexical complexity (Segler et al., 2002).",
        "We thus make use of examples from a dictionary targeting learners.",
        "Specifically, we make use of the examples from the Collins COBUILD Student's Dictionary (Sinclair, 2006), as it is widely used by ESL learners.",
        "The content in COBUILD is based on actual English usage and derived from analysis of a large corpus of written and spoken English, thereby providing authentic examples (Sinclair, 2006).",

        "Then, when the learner clicks on a word while reading, the manager sends the word with its sense information to the lexical database and brings the word with its sense-specific lexical information back to the learner from the lexical database.",

        "Although for some internal testing with different WSD systems we used other third-party software (e.g., the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003)), our word sense disam-biguator (see below) provides tokenization, lemma-tization, and POS tagging, as well as collocation identification.",

        "To obtain the sense-appropriate information, we must perform word sense disambiguation (WSD) on the input text.",
        "We use SenseRelate::AllWords (SR:AW) (Pedersen and Kolhatkar, 2009) to perform WSD of input texts, as this system has broad coverage of content words.",
        "Given that SR:AW does not outperform the most frequent sense (MFS) baseline, we intend to explore using the MFS in the future, as well as other WSD systems, such as SenseLearner (Mihalcea and Cso-mai, 2005).",
        "However, the quality of SR:AW (F-measure of 54?61% on different corpora) is sufficient to explore in our system and gives us a point to work from.",
        "Indeed, as we will see in section 5.3,",
        "while SR:AW makes errors, vocabulary learning is, in some ways, perhaps not dramatically impeded.",
        "Even with a WSD system, pointing to appropriate examples is complicated by the fact that the database of learner-appropriate examples is from one repository (COBUILD, see section 2), while automatic WSD systems generally use senses from another (WordNet).",
        "The lexical database, then, is indexed by WordNet senses, each of which points to an appropriate corresponding COBUILD sense.",
        "While we would prefer disambiguating COBUILD senses directly, we are not aware of any systems which do this or any COBUILD sense-tagged data to train a system on.",
        "If the benefits for vocabulary acquisition gained by providing learner-friendly examples from COBUILD merit it, future work could explore building a collection of COBUILD-tagged data to train a WSD system?perhaps a semi-automatic process using the automatic system we describe next.",
        "To build a lexical database covering all words, we built a word sense alignment (WSA) system; this is also in line with a related research agenda investigating the correspondences between sense inventories (Eom et al., 2012).",
        "Space limitations preclude a more detailed discussion, but the WSA system works by running SR:AW on COBUILD examples in order to induce a basic alignment structure between WordNet and COBUILD.",
        "We then post-process this structure, relying on a heuristic of favoring flatter alignment structures?i.e., links spread out more evenly between senses in each inventory.1 Iteratively replacing one link with another, to give flatter structures, we weight each type of proposed alignment and accept a new alignment if the weight combined with the probability originally assigned by the WSD system is the best improvement over that of the original alignment structure.",
        "After all these steps, the alignments give the lexical database for linking WSD output to COBUILD senses.",
        "We consider alignment structures wherein each WordNet sense maps to exactly one COBUILD sense, to match the task at hand, i.e., mapping each disambiguated WordNet sense to a single set of COBUILD examples.",
        "This assumption also makes postprocessing feasible: instead of considering an 1The general idea is to use information about the alignment structure as a whole; flatter alignments is a convenient heuristic, in lieu of having any other additional information.",
        "exponential number of alignment structures, we consider only a polynomial number.",
        "Having collected alignment judgments from linguistics students and faculty, we evaluated the system against a small set of nine words, covering 63 WordNet senses (Eom et al., 2012).",
        "The WSA system had a precision of 42.7% (recall=44.5%) when evaluating against the most popular sense, but a precision of 60.7% (recall=36.5%) when evaluating against all senses that seem to be related.",
        "We focus on precision since it is important to know whether a learner is being pointed to a correct set of examples or not; whether there are other possibly relevant examples to show is less important.",
        "In Eom et al. (2012), we discuss some difficulties of aligning between the two resources in the general case; while some senses go unaligned between the resources, this was not the case for the words used in this study.",
        "For this study, since we use predetermined input texts, we also created gold-standard information, where each word in the text is manually given a link to the appropriate COBUILD information; note that here there is no intermediate WordNet sense to account for.",
        "This lets us gauge: a) whether the gold-standard information is helpful to learners, and b) comparatively speaking, what the effects are of using the potentially noisy information provided by the functioning system."

        "Since the first research question is to examine the improvement between the pretest and the posttest, the test of homogeneity of variance was carried out to ensure that the pretest/posttest scores of the participants across the four groups showed similar variances.",
        "Levene's test of homogeneity of variances suggested that the 4 groups could be considered to have similar variances on both the pretest (F (3, 55) = 0.49, p = 0.69) and the post-test (F (3, 56) = 0.13, p = 0.94), meaning that this assumption underlying the use of ANOVA was met.",

        "Turning to the results of the treatments in table 3, the four groups show larger differences on their posttest.",

        "In other words, not considering Group, there is evidence of improvement from pre to posttest.",
        "Most crucially related to the first research question about whether the groups would have different amounts of vocabulary acquisition over time, we see a significant Time*Group effect (F (3, 56) = 7.20, p < .001, partial eta2= 0.28).",
        "The partial eta2 values for Time (0.53) and Time*Group (0.28) in table 2 represent large effect sizes which thus provide strong evidence for the differences.",

        "The first comparisons, in table 4, show significant mean differences between the pretest and posttest for three groups (GS, SS, AS), whereas no significant difference is observed in the NS group, meaning that the three groups who received lexical information showed improvement whereas the group who received no information did not.",

        "performance on the overall scores of their pretest and posttest, we examine their performance over their pretest and posttest only on words they clicked while reading, as well as how much they clicked.",

        "Although these differences are not statistically significant, the apparent trend may suggest that the GS group realized",
        "for clicked words (percentage correct) they could get high-quality lexical information from clicking words and so clicked more often.",
        "Examining only clicked target words, the test of homogeneity confirmed the error variance of all participants were equivalent at the outset of the study (p = 0.15).",
        "The percentages correct of the words that were clicked in the pretest and posttest are in table 6.",
        "The pre to post gain here conveys a general trend: for the words participants clicked on, they showed improvement, with larger gains than for all words (compare the best gain of 26% in table 3).",
        "As with all words, in the RM ANOVA the effect of Time shows a statistically significant difference (F (1, 42) = 96.20, p < 0.01).",

        "Despite non-significance, two potentially interesting points emerge which can be followed up on in the future: 1) descriptively speaking, the SS group shows the largest gain between pretest and posttest (56%); and 2) the AS group shows as much improvement as the GS group (45%).",
        "This may come from the fact that the number of senses listed for many clicked words was small enough (e.g., 2?3) to find an appropriate sense.",

        "This may be related to the small number of sense entries of the target words (average = 2.95), and a further study should be done on target words with more sense entries, in addition to validating some of the preliminary results presented in this paper regarding clicked words.",
