        "Such a computational model can be useful in developing an early warning system able to analyze writing samples for signs of mental distress.",
        "This could serve as a red flag, signaling when someone might need a professional assessment by a clinician.",
        "This paper reports on classification of distressed and non-distressed short, written excerpts from relevant web forums, using features automatically extracted from input text.",
        "Varying the value of k in k-fold cross-validation shows that both coarse-grained and fine-grained automatic classification of affect states are generally 20% more accurate in detecting affect state than randomly assigning a distress label to a text.",
        "The study also compares the importance of bundled linguistic super-factors with a 2k factorial model.",
        "Analyzing the importance of different linguistic features for this task indicates main effects of affect word list matches, pronouns, and parts of speech in the predictive model.",
        "Excerpt length contributed to interaction effects.",

        "The societal costs of treating mental health are staggering.",
        "Sultz and Young (2011) estimate that the total mental health care treatment costs in the United States amount to more than USD 100 billion per year.",
        "The health care system in the United States generally focuses on treating patients?",
        "illnesses rather than on preventing their occurrence, and mental health care is no exception.",
        "Mental health diagnosis typically takes place after patients already show behavioral and physical symptoms associated with mental distress.",
        "Moreover, there are 33,000 suicides every year in the United States and, according to Matykiewicz et al. (2009; referencing Kung et al. (2008)), ?",
        "[i]n the United States, suicide ranks second as the leading cause of death among 25-34 year-olds and the third leading cause of death among 15-25 year-olds?",
        "(p. 179).",
        "Diagnosing mental illnesses is difficult.",
        "For example, depression has a prevalence of 19.5%, according to Mitchell et al. (2009), and is mostly diagnosed and treated by general practitioners.",
        "However, it is diagnosed correctly in only 47.3% of cases.",
        "Commonly, the initial assessment of mental distress does not rely on clinical tests or advanced technology, and the evaluation of a patient is typically performed through the use of standardized questionnaires.",
        "A patient's answers are then compiled and compared with disease classification guidelines, such as the International Classification of Diseases or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, to guide the patient's diagnosis.",
        "However, these diagnostic methods are not precise and have high rates of false positives and false negatives.",
        "For example, in the United States, half of those who received mental health treatment did not meet the diagnostic criteria for a mental disorder (Kessler et al., 2005).",
        "In addition, societal and financial barriers prevent many people from seeking medical attention.",
        "In fact, in the USA, between 1990 and 2003, two-thirds of those with mental disorders did not receive treatment (Kessler et al., 2005).",
        "Many societies around the world stigmatize and discriminate against people with mental disorders, contributing to the unwillingness of individuals to acknowledge the problem and seek help (Michels et al., 2006; Fabrega, 1991).",
        "It would be helpful if, e.g., military clinicians could effectively and non-invasively analyze soldiers?",
        "writing samples, social media posts, or email correspondence to screen service members for trouble coping with combat-related stress, to complement self-reporting or patient surveys.",
        "Careful thought would be required for access to such information so that it helps and not hurts.",
        "It seems useful as additional information for doctors.",
        "We report on an initial study in which we analyze a smaller balanced dataset and experiment with inference of affect states at two different levels of affective granularity.",
        "Our work is based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) using supervised machine learning.",
        "We also discuss 2k factorial, a method commonly used in engineering statistics, which has been successfully applied to many domains within engineering and product design for feature selection.",
        "Our work contributes initial reference values for what can be achieved by applying four fundamental supervised classification methods and text-based features to the challenging task of automatically classifying mental affect states in short texts based on just a small dataset.",
        "We discuss performance both in terms of different experimental setups, which linguistic features matter, and how labels confuse with each other.",
        "2 Relevant previous work Computational linguistics approaches have been applied to a range of challenging problems with impact outside the language technology field, e.g., to predict pricing movements on the stock market (Schumaker, 2010) or opinions on political candidates in event prediction markets (Lerman et al., 2008).",
        "In psychology, psychiatry, and criminology, studies with natural language data have found differences in behaviors for mental health patients or inmates with various mental health disorders (e.g., Andreasen and Pfohl, 1976; Harvey, 1983; Ragin and Oltmanns, 1983; Fraser et al., 1986; Endres, 2004; Gawda, 2010).",

        "or ?completers?",
        "as accurately as mental health experts (p. 96).",
        "The authors also found that emotional content was useful for the expert clinicians, but not for the automatic inference methods.",
        "However, this might indicate that the study did not consider an appropriate feature set.",
        "In comparison, Alm (2009) explored a more comprehensive feature set for automatic affect prediction in text.",
        "Matykiewicz et al. (2009) discriminated between suicide notes and control texts using automatic clustering techniques, and discovered sub-clusters within suicide writings.",
        "In 2011, Pestian et al. (2012) organized a challenge to determine emotions and meaningful information in notes by suicide completers.",

        "The minimum number of experiments needed to deduce a model that explains the direct and interaction effects of k factors is 2k.",
        "For example, a problem in which 5 factors are assumed to affect the value of a response requires executing 25=32 experiments, each with a unique arrangement of factor levels.",
        "Replications of these experiments are recommended to increase accuracy in the estimation of the term coefficients.",
        "Having 42 candidate linguistic features that could influence an evaluator's decisions to categorize the distress state of a text would have required at least 242 (over 4 trillion!)",

        "This mapping was used to generate a response formula (similar to a multi-attribute regression expression) that found the direct effect of the super-factors and their interactions on the distress evaluation.",
        "We found that three main effects of the super-factors and four of their interactions were statistically significant.",
        "The significant super-factors were affect, pronoun, and part of speech.",

        "We further propose using the 2k factorial mechanism to systematically reduce the super-factors into simpler features.",
        "For example, because one of the super-factors did not show a significant main effect, we can assume that its linguistic features do not individually reflect distress or non-distress.",
        "Thus, one could reconfigure new super-features, assigning new values to the 200 excerpts, and repeat the analysis and remove any super-feature whose main and secondary effects are not significant.",

        "In clinical settings, data can be especially hard to obtain, and it is useful to understand the limitations and affordances of modeling with limited data.",
        "Similarly, it is important to understand how models perform on fundamental algorithms and shallow features extracted from text that can generalize to, for example, resource-poor languages.",
        "While this data was adequate for exploratory investigation, a larger, clinical dataset would be less prone to selection bias.",
        "Combining text with other analysis information seems key in future work.",
        "Also, more advanced algorithms could yield more accurate predictions, as could iterations of the 2k factorial analysis.",
