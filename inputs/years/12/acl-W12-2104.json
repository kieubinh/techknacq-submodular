        "We examine the response to the recent natural disaster Hurricane Irene on Twitter.com.",
        "We collect over 65,000 Twitter messages relating to Hurricane Irene from August 18th to August 31st, 2011, and group them by location and gender.",
        "We train a sentiment classifier to categorize messages based on level of concern, and then use this classifier to investigate demographic differences.",
        "We report three principal findings: (1) the number of Twitter messages related to Hurricane Irene in directly affected regions peaks around the time the hurricane hits that region; (2) the level of concern in the days leading up to the hurricane's arrival is dependent on region; and (3) the level of concern is dependent on gender, with females being more likely to express concern than males.",
        "Qualitative linguistic variations further support these differences.",
        "We conclude that social media analysis provides a viable, real-time complement to traditional survey methods for understanding public perception towards an impending disaster.",
        "Introduction In 2011, natural disasters cost the United States more than 1,000 lives and $52 billion.",
        "The number of disasters costing over $1 billion in 2011 (twelve) is more than in the entire decade of the 1980s.1 As the number of people living in disaster-prone areas grows, it becomes increasingly important to have reliable, up-to-the-minute assessments of emergency preparedness during impending disas-1?Record year for billion-dollar disasters?, CBS News, December 7, 2011. ters.",
        "Understanding issues such as personal risk perception, preparedness, and evacuation plans helps public agencies better tailor emergency warnings, preparations, and response.",
        "Social scientists typically investigate these issues using polling data.",
        "The research shows significant demographic differences in response to government warnings, personal risk assessment, and evacuation decisions (Perry and Mushkatel, 1986; Perry and Lindell, 1991; Goltz et al., 1992; Fothergill et al., 1999; West and Orr, 2007; Enarson, 1998).",
        "For example, Fothergill et al. (1999) find that minorities differ in their risk perception and in their response to emergency warnings, with some groups having fatalistic sentiments that lead to greater fear and less preparedness.",
        "Goltz et al. (1992) find that people with lower income and education, Hispanics, and women all expressed greater fear of earthquakes.",
        "This past research suggests governments could benefit by tailoring their messaging and response to address the variability between groups.",
        "While survey data have advanced our knowledge of these issues, they have two major drawbacks for use in disaster research.",
        "First, most surveys rely on responses to hypothetical scenarios, for example by asking subjects if they would evacuate under certain scenarios.",
        "This hypothetical bias is well-known (Murphy et al., 2005).",
        "Second, surveys are often impractical in disaster scenarios.",
        "In a rapidly-changing environment, governments cannot wait for a time-consuming survey to be conducted and the results analyzed before making warning and response decisions.",
        "Additionally, survey response rates shortly before or after a disaster are likely to be quite low, as citizens are either without power or are busy preparing or rebuilding.",
        "Thus, it is difficult to collect data",
        "during the critical times immediately before and after the disaster.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of assessing public risk perception using social media analysis.",
        "Social media analysis has recently been used to estimate trends of interest such as stock prices (Gilbert and Karahalios, 2010), movie sales (Asur and Huberman, 2010), political mood (O?Connor et al., 2010a), and influenza rates (Lam-pos and Cristianini, 2010; Culotta, 2010; Culotta, 2012).",
        "We apply a similar methodology here to assess the public's level of concern toward an impending natural disaster.",
        "As a case study, we examine attitudes toward Hurricane Irene expressed on Twitter.com.",
        "We collect over 65,000 Twitter messages referencing Hurricane Irene between August 18th and August 31st, 2011; and we train a sentiment classifier to annotate messages by level of concern.",
        "We specifically look at how message volume and sentiment varies over time, location, and gender.",
        "Our findings indicate that message volume increases over the days leading up to the hurricane, and then sharply decreases following its dispersal.",
        "The timing of the increase and subsequent decrease in messages differs based on the location relative to the storm.",
        "There is also an increasing proportion of concerned messages leading up to Hurricane Irene's arrival, which then decreases after Irene dissipation.",
        "A demographic analysis of the proportion of concerned messages shows significant differences both by region and gender.",
        "The gender differences in particular are supported by previous survey results from the social science literature (West and Orr, 2007).",
        "These results suggest that social media analysis is a viable technology for understanding public perception during a hurricane.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: First, we describe the data collection methodology, including how messages are annotated with location and gender.",
        "Next, we present sentiment classification experiments comparing various classifiers, tokenization procedures, and feature sets.",
        "Finally, we apply this classifier to the entire message set and analyze demographic variation in levels of concern."

        "Recent research has investigated the effectiveness of social media for crisis communication (Savelyev et al., 2011) ?",
        "indeed, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency now uses Twitter to disseminate information during natural disasters (Kalish, 2011).",
        "Other work has examined the spread of false rumors during earthquakes (Mendoza et al., 2010) and tsunamis (Acar and Muraki, 2011) and characterized social network dynamics during floods (Cheong and Cheong, 2011), fires (Vieweg et al., 2010), and violence (Heverin and Zach, 2010).",
        "While some of this past research organizes messages by topic, to our knowledge no work has analyzed disaster sentiment or its demographic determinants.",
        "Survey research by West and Orr (2007) concluded that women may feel more vulnerable during hurricanes because they are more likely to have children and belong to a lower socio-economic class.",
        "Richer people, they find, tend to have an easier time dealing with natural disasters like hurricanes.",
        "These reasons might explain our finding that women are more likely on Twitter to show concern than men about Hurricane Irene.",
        "West and Orr also find differences in regional perceptions of vulnerability between coastal areas and non-coastal areas.",
        "Our location annotation must be more precise before we can perform a similar analysis.",
        "More generally, our approach can be considered a type of computational social science, an emerging area of study applying computer science algorithms to social science research (Lazer et al., 2009; Hopkins and King, 2010).",
        "Conclusion and Future Work Our results show that analyzing Twitter messages relating to Hurricane Irene reveals differences in sentiment depending on a person's gender or location.",
        "We conclude that social media analysis is a viable complement to existing survey methodologies, providing real-time insight into public perceptions of a disaster.",
        "Future directions include investigating how to account for classifier error in hypothesis testing (Fuller, 1987), adjusting classification proportions using quantification methods (Forman, 2007), as well as applying the approach to different disasters and identifying additional sentiment classes of interest.",
        "Finally, it will be important to infer a greater variety of demographic attributes and also to adjust for the demographic bias inherent in social media."
