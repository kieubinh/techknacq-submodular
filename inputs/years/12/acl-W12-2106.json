        "Twitter tracks the follower count of the tweet's author, which we feel is the best approximation of this.",
        "Thus we do not perform retweet count prediction, but instead cast our task as: Given the content of a tweet, perform a multi-class classification that predicts its range of retweet per follower (RTpF) ratio."
