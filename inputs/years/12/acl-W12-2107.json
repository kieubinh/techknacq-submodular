        "In addition to grammar adaptation, we can enrich our grammars by increasing the non-terminal sets.",
        "To do this, we created a nested hierarchy of ?regions?",
        "of the emoticons, with constraints related to the canonical composition of the faces, e.g., eyes are inside of faces, noses/mouths between eyes, etc.",
        "These non-terminals replace our generic non-terminal X in the rule schemata.",
        "For the current paper, we included the following five ?region?",
        "non-terminals: ITEM, OUT, FACE, EYES, NM.",
        "The non-terminal ITEM is intended as a topmost non-terminal to allow multiple emoticons in a single sequence, via an ITEM ?",

        "ITEM ITEM) has zero or one non-terminals on the righthand side.",
        "In our new schemata, non-terminals on the left-hand side can only have non-terminals on the right-hand side at the same or lower levels.",
        "This enforces the nesting constraint, i.e., that eyes are inside of the face.",
        "Levels can be omitted however ?",
        "e.g., eyes but no explicit face delimiter ?",
        "hence we can ?skip?",

        "weight.",

        "weight) or rewrite to the next level after emitting symbols (with a ?move to next level?",
        "weight).",
        "To encode a preference to move to the next level rather than to stay at the same level, we assign a weight of 1 to moving to the next level and a weight of 0.5 to staying at the same level.",
        "The ?skip?",
        "weights depend on the level, e.g., skipping OUT should be cheap (weight of 0.5), while skipping the others more expensive (weight of 0.1).",
        "These weights are like counts, and are added to the similarity counts when deriving the probability of the rule.",
        "Finally, there is a rule in the schemata in Table 1 with a pair of symbols and no middle non-terminal.",
        "This is most appropriate for eyes, hence will only be generated at that level.",
        "Similarly, the single symbol on the right-hand side is for the NM (nose/mouth) region.",
        "Table 2 presents our expanded rule schemata.",
        "Note that the grammar generated with this expanded set of non-terminals is robust, just as the earlier grammar is, in that every sequence is guaranteed to have a parse.",
