        "Yet, there are still a large number of people who are denied this fundamental human right ?",
        "access to information.",
        "In 2006 the UN conducted an audit with the aim of testing the state of accessibility of the leading websites around the world.",
        "The results were rather disappointing, with only three out of 100 tested web pages achieving basic accessibility status.",
        "It is therefore clear that one of the priorities for the future is working on enabling inclusion of all the groups that are currently marginalised and denied equal access to information as the rest of the population.",
        "Written information available online is far too often presented in a way that is perceived as incomprehensible to individuals with cognitive disabilities.",
        "It is therefore necessary to simplify the complex textual content in order to make it more accessible.",
        "However, manual simplification is too time-consuming and little cost-effective so as to yield sufficient amount of simplified reading material in a satisfactory time frame.",
        "Hence, the need and interest arise to develop automatic or semi-automatic simplification tools that would (partially) substitute humans in carrying out this laborious task.",
        "Our project is one such aspiration.",
        "Our goal is to offer an automated text simplification tool for Spanish, targeted at readers with cognitive disabilities.",
        "We delimit our research to simplification of informative texts and news articles.",
        "So far we have focused primarily on syntactic simplification, with an already implemented module currently in the test stage (Bott and Saggion, 2012b).",
        "The present work, however, deals with lexical simplification and is centred around a corpus analysis, a preparatory stage for the development of a separate lexical module in the future.",
        "Earlier work already establishes the importance of lexical changes for text simplification (Carroll et al., 1998; Caseli et al., 2009; De Belder et al., 2010).",
        "Upon examining a parallel corpus consisting of original and manually simplified newspaper articles in Spanish, we have found that by far the most common type of changes applied by human editors are precisely lexical changes, accounting for 17.48% of all annotated operations (Bott and Saggion, 2012a).",
        "Words perceived as more complicated are replaced",
        "by their simpler synonyms.",
        "A recurring example is that of reporting verbs.",
        "Corpus analysis shows a clear tendency towards replacing all reporting verbs such as advertir (warn), afirmar (declare), explicar (explain), etc.",
        "with the ubiquitous decir (say).",

        "Text simplification has so far been approached with two different aims.",
        "One is to offer simplified versions of original text to human readers, such as foreign language learners (Petersen and Ostendorf, 2007; Medero and Ostendorf, 2011); aphasic people (Devlin and Unthank, 2006); low literacy individuals (Specia, 2010) and others.",
        "On the other hand, simplified text is seen as input for further natural language processing to enhance its proficiency, e.g. in machine translation or information retrieval tools (Klebanov et al., 2004).",
        "The earliest simplification systems employed a rule-based approach and focused on syntactic structure of the text (Chan-drasekar et al., 1996).",
        "The PSET project (Carroll et al., 1998) dealt with simplification of news articles in English for aphasic readers.",
        "Together with syntactic analysis and transformations similar to those of Chandrasekar et al. (1996), they employed lexical simplification based on looking up synonyms in WordNet and extracting Kucera-Francis frequency from the Oxford Psycholinguistic Database (Quin-lan, 1992).",
        "Therefore, the most frequent of a set of synonyms for every content word of the input text was chosen to appear in its simplified version.",
        "The above approach to lexical simplification has been repeated in a number of works (Lal and Ruger, 2002; Burstein et al., 2007).",
        "Bautista et al. (2009) also rely on a dictionary of synonyms, but their criterion for choosing the most appropriate one is word-length rather than frequency.",
        "Caseli et al. (2009) analyse lexical operations on a parallel corpus of original and manually simplified texts in Portuguese, using lists of simple words and discourse markers as resources.",
        "Bautista et al. (2011) focused on numerical expressions as one particular problem of lexical simplification and suggested the use of hedges as a means of dealing with complex numerical content.",
        "Given the fact that many words tend to be poly-semic, attempts have been made to address this issue so as to provide more accurate, context-aware lexical substitution.",
        "De Belder et al. (2010) were the first to employ word sense disambiguation techniques in order to capture contextual information, while Biran et al. (2011) apply an unsupervised method for learning pairs of complex and simple synonyms based on an unaligned corpus of texts from the original Wikipedia and Simple English Wikipedia."

        "The automatic alignments have then been manually corrected through a graphical editing tool within the GATE framework (Cunningham et al., 2002).",
        "A total of 570 sentences have been aligned (246 in original and 324 in simple texts), with the following correlations between them: one to one, one to many or many to one, as well as cases where there is no correlation (cases of content reduction through summarisation or information expansion through the introduction of definitions).",
        "The alignments facilitate the observation of the corpus, particularly cases where entire sentences have been eliminated or inserted.",
        "A parallel corpus thus aligned enables us to engage in data analysis as well as possibly carry out machine learning experiments to treat specific problems we have so far detected.",
        "We have documented all simplification operations used by human editors and placed them in eight major categories applied at various linguistic levels (individual words, phrases or sentences).",
        "The operations are change, delete, insert, split, proximization, re-order, select and join, listed in the decreasing order of their relative frequency in the corpus.",

        "We have found that for 54.76% of the words, the frequency of the simple word is higher than the frequency of its original equivalent; in 30.95% of the cases, the frequency is the same; only 3.57% of the simple words have lower frequency than the corresponding original ones; and in 10.71% of the cases it was impossible to analyse the frequency since the original word was a multi-word expression not included in the dictionary, as is the case with complex conjunctions like sin embargo (however) or pese a (despite).",

        "Analysis suggests that frequency in combination with word length is the necessary combination of factors to consider when deciding on the choice among a set of synonyms to replace a difficult input word.",
        "On the other hand, a high number of polysemic input words underline the importance of including word sense disambiguation as part of the lexical substitution module.",
        "Based on the available data, we have so far derived a set of rules concerning reporting verbs, adjectives of nationality, numerical expressions and named entities, all of which are to be further developed and implemented in the future.",
        "Numerical expressions in particular are given an important place in our system and more in-depth analysis is being carried out.",
        "We are working on rounding of big numbers and the use of modifiers in the simplification of these expressions.",
        "A number of issues are still to be tackled, such as elimination of nominalisation and simplification of multi-word expressions.",
        "The ultimate goal is to implement the lexical module as part of a larger architecture of the system for automatic text simplification for Spanish."
