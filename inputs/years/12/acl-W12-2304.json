        "In this paper we propose a new formulation to the unsupervised word segmentation problem.",
        "Our idea is based on the observation that language evolves because of the need to reduce communication efforts.",
        "For instance, new terminologies, abbreviations, and slang that carry complex semantics which cannot be efficiently expressed in the original languages are invented so that concepts can be conveyed.",
        "Such an evolution, we hypothesize, is limited to the extent where the evolved vocabulary exhibits similar complexity as the original one, in light of reducing the extra cost to pick up the new language.",
        "This process is realized as an optimization problem called regularized compression, which gets this name from its analogy to text compression.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "We briefly summarize related work on unsupervised word segmentation in Section 2.",
        "In Section 3, we introduce the proposed formulation.",

        "The past few years have seen many nonparametric Bayesian methods developed to model natural languages.",
        "Many such applications were applied to word segmentation and have collectively reshaped the entire research field.",
        "Two most notable examples are hierarchical Bayesian models and the minimum description length principle.",
        "Our method fits in the latter category since we use this principle to optimize model parameters.",
        "Hierarchical Bayesian methods were first introduced to complement conventional probabilistic methods to facilitate context-aware word generation.",

        "Their approach was a significant improvement over conventional probabilistic methods, and has inspired further explorations into more advanced hierarchical modeling techniques.",
        "Such examples include the nested Pitman-Yor process (Mochihashi et al., 2009), a sophisticated installment for hierarchi",
        "cal modeling at both word and character levels, and adaptor grammars (Johnson and Goldwater, 2009), a framework that aligns HDP to probabilistic context-free grammars.",
        "The minimum description length (MDL) principle, originally developed in the context of information theory, was adopted in Bayesian statistics as a principled model selection method (Rissanen, 1978).",
        "Its connection to lexical acquisition was first uncovered in behavioral studies, and early applications focused mostly on applying MDL to induce word segmentation that results in compact lexicons (Kit and Wilks, 1999; Yu, 2000; Argamon et al., 2004).",
        "More recent approaches (Zhikov et al., 2010; Hewlett and Cohen, 2011) used MDL in combination with existing algorithms, such as branching entropy (Tanaka-Ishii, 2005; Jin and Ishii, 2006) and bootstrap voting experts (Hewlett and Cohen, 2009), to determine the best segmentation parameters.",
        "On various benchmarks, MDL-powered algorithms have achieved state-of-the-art performance, sometimes even surpassing that of the most sophisticated hierarchical modeling methods."

        "Preliminary experimental results suggest that the regularized compression method, even only with partial evidence, seems as effective as the state-of-the-art methods in different language settings.",
        "When paired with MDL criteria, regularized compression is comparable to hierarchical Bayesian methods and MDL-based algorithms in terms of segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency.",
        "Furthermore, regularized compression is less memory-demanding than the other approaches; thus, it scales more easily to large corpora for carrying out certain tasks such as segmenting historical texts written in ancient languages, or preprocessing a large dataset for subsequent manual annotation.",
        "We have identified a number of limitations of regular compression.",
        "First, the choice of candidate n-grams does not cover hapax legomena, i.e., words that occur only once in the corpus.",
        "At present, precluding these low-frequency n-grams seems to be a necessary compromise due to our limited understanding about the dynamics behind regular compression.",
        "Second, regularized compression does not work well with low volume data, since on smaller dataset the distribution of frequency counts is less precise.",
        "Third, the algorithm may stop identifying new word types at some point.",
        "We suspect that this is related to the choice of n-gram, since in our implementation no two existing ?words?",
        "can be aggregated into one.",
        "These issues shall be addressed in our future work."
