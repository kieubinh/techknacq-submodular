        "For the final devoicing language, the summed weight of IDENT-VOICE and CAT?/bet/ (6.05) is greater than the weight of CAT?/bed/ (3.65), and so the grammar assigns higher probability to (/bet/, [bet]), as shown in Table 4.",
        "For the ternary contrast language on the other hand, the UR constraints have zero weight, and so the decision is fully determined by the relatively high weighted IDENT-VOICE, favoring (/bet/, [bet]).",
        "Even though the learner of the final devoicing language has not acquired the single UR of the traditional phonological analysis, it has acquired a contextually conditioned distribution over UR choices that is appropriate for the learning data.",
        "There are weights on the UR constraints that would fail to yield this result.",
        "For example, if CAT?/bet/ had a sufficiently high weight relative to the other constraints, then the UR would be fixed as /bet/, and there would be no weighting of the remaining constraints that would pick both [beda] as the highest probability candidate for ?cats?, and [mota] as the highest probability candidate for ?dogs?.",
        "Anticipating the discussion of learning in the next section, the weight configuration just described can form a local minimum for our learner.",

        "The weights for the coda devoicing language are such that a non-negligible proportion of the probability is reserved for unfaithful (/bed/, [bet]).",
        "Since we have in the case of final devoicing an example of a multiple UR analysis for a language with a phonological regularity, we need to ask whether the grammar generalizes appropriately.",
        "The answer is yes.",
        "Because of the high weight of NO-CODA-VOICE (401.41) and relatively low weight of IDENT-VOICE (6.05), an underlying voiced obstru-ent will with extremely high probability map to a surface voiceless one in word-final position.",
        "In generating final devoicing this grammar produces predictable relationships between morphologically related words.",
        "For example, if a learner with this grammar were to see a plural like [maga] and no singular form, it would posit only /mag/ as the UR for the root.",
        "Nonetheless, it would predict with probability near 1 that the singular is pronounced [mak].",
        "Given the observed data from the language in Table 4, it would not have been necessary for the learner to construct a grammar that generalizes in this way.",
        "For example, the grammar learned for the ternary contrast language also generates the alternation between [bet] and [bed+a], without producing generalized final devoicing.",
        "We thus require a learner with a bias for generalization.",
        "Our learner, described in the next section, meets this requirement by incorporating an independently motivated preference for high weighted Output constraints, and low weighted Faithfulness.",

        "Each of these (Input, UR, SR) triples potentially incurs distinct constraint violations.",

        "The probabilities p(yij , zijk |xi) are defined just as for simple input/output probabilities?they simply include a contribution from candidates on URs.",

        "In such cases these constraints are always satisfied; we therefore omit them from our analyses without loss of correctness.",
        "This grammatical framework allows a way of viewing the problem of learning as somewhat agnostic with respect to URs.",
        "The learner observes some particular distribution over SRs for a particular input morpheme string and can make any consistent choice about the distribution over URs.",
        "It is in this respect that our approach diverges most importantly from prior work on learning URs in Optimality Theory-like frameworks.",
        "Our model incorporates ideas from Apoussidou (2007), who uses UR constraints for on-line learning of URs in a probabilistic OT framework, and Eisenstat (2009), who uses a log-linear model very similar to ours.",
        "Our approach differs, however, in that learning of unique URs is not taken as a goal.",
        "With the above explicit statement of probabilities, the learner's problem is then to minimize the distinction between its predicted Input/SR distribution and the observed probabilities.",
        "For the results presented here, we minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence (Kullback and Leibler, 1951) between the predicted distribution pw and observed distribution p?.",
        "We use an L2 (Gaussian) prior (Tychonoff and Arsenin, 1977) on the weights.",
        "Such a prior introduces a pressure for lower weights, which is especially important for categorical learning cases (in which KL minimization reduces to likelihood maximization).",
        "These problems contain probabilities at unity, causing weights to scale arbitrarily high without additional restriction.",
        "We used a regularization with ?2 = 10, 000 for all solutions presented in this paper.",
        "We also include in our prior a term that maximizes the sum of the weights of Output constraints, and minimizes the sum of the weights of Faithfulness constraints.",
        "The objective function remains bounded from above by the L2 prior, and is also bounded from below by a restriction to non-negative weights.",
        "This term is adapted from research on phonotactic learning in OT starting with Smolensky (1996); see further references in Jesney and Tessier (2011).",
        "It resembles somewhat the R-measure of Prince and Tesar (2004), but unlike the R-measure this added prior is continuous, improving performance in optimization.",
        "In experimentation, we found that this term was necessary to ensure generalization; the L2 prior alone, even with a smaller variance for Faithfulness than Output constraints, was insufficient.",
        "It might be possible to create a more refined version of this term that is sensitive to dependencies between constraints, but this version has sufficed for our purposes.",

        "It is a generally unresolved issue how a learner decides whether to use one, or more, URs in an analysis of an alternation.",
        "Presumably, learners begin by encoding the various phonological realizations of a morpheme.",
        "How, and when, do they decide to collapse these into a single UR?",
        "The problem is made more difficult because as noted in the introduction, learners need to consider contextually conditioned UR choice, which is required for at least phonologically conditioned suppletive allomorphy.",
        "Previous work on UR learning, including Tesar (2006), abstracts from this issue by allowing only single URs.",
        "As a reviewer suggests, a Minimum Description Length criterion might create a bias for fewer URs, but this seems not yet to have been implemented.",
        "In the present approach, phonological generalizations can be acquired even when multiple URs are used, as shown in all of our simulations.",
        "This means that the issue raised in the last paragraph can be completely sidestepped by never requiring learners to adopt single URs for alternating morphemes.",
        "This approach also sidesteps the difficult issues of choosing which parts of each alternant make up the single UR, and when to leave some structure underspecified.",
        "With the French simulation, we have further shown that UR choice handles data that escape underspecification.",
        "These advantages suggest that the single UR doctrine, in place since Jakobson (1948), is worth reconsidering, especially in frameworks like OT that can formalize contextual choice of URs without loss of generalization.",
        "One direction for further research is in model-ing not only choice between allomorphs, but also their discovery in morpheme segmentation, which involves increasing the size of the hypothesized UR constraint set.",
        "Our initial explorations show promise, and this could lead to useful applications in natural language processing, in which MaxEnt models are of course already common.",
        "Another extension is to other cases of semi-supervised learning.",
        "Here we sum over all of the (UR, SR) pairs corresponding to an observed form.",
        "Similar summations can be made over other full structures when the learning data are incomplete: over representations such as syllable structures and syntactic trees, and even over derivations.",
        "One such extension that we have explored is to learning ?opacity?",
        "(Kiparsky, 1973); see Staubs and Pater (2012) for initial results, which do rely on a type of abstract UR.",
        "Finally, one might attempt to model learning of paradigmatic generalizations that are probabilistic across the lexicon, as in Turkish voicing (Becker et al., 2011) - see the related MaxEnt results in Hayes et al. (2009) and Moore-Cantwell (2012)."
