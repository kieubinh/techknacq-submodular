        "From these alignments, we automatically extract narrative recall scores which can then be used for diagnostic screening.",
        "The significant reduction in alignment error rate (AER) afforded by the graph-based method results in improved automatic scoring and diagnostic classification.",

      "text": [
        "Much of the work in biomedical natural language processing has focused on mining information from electronic health records, clinical notes, and medical literature, but NLP is also very well suited for ana-lyzing patient language data, in terms of both content and linguistic features, for neurological evaluation.",
        "NLP-driven analysis of clinical language data has been used to assess language development (Sagae et al., 2005), language impairment (Gabani et al., 2009) and cognitive status (Roark et al., 2007; Roark et al., 2011).",
        "These approaches rely on the extraction of syntactic features from spoken language transcripts in order to identify characteristics of language use associated with a particular disorder.",
        "In this paper, rather than focusing on linguistic features, we instead propose an NLP-based method for automating the standard manual method for scoring the Wechsler Logical Memory (WLM) subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale (Wechsler, 1997) with the eventual goal of developing a screening tool for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), the earliest observable precursor to dementia.",
        "During standard administration of the WLM, the examiner reads a brief narrative to the subject, who then retells the story to the examiner, once immediately upon hearing the story and a second time after a 30-minute delay.",
        "The examiner scores the retelling in real time by counting the number of recalled story elements, each of which corresponds to a word or short phrase in the source narrative.",
        "Our method for automatically extracting the score from a retelling relies on an alignment between substrings in the retelling and substrings in the original narrative.",
        "The scores thus extracted can then be used for diagnostic classification.",
        "Previous approaches to alignment-based narrative analysis (Prud?hommeaux and Roark, 2011a; Prud?hommeaux and Roark, 2011b) have relied exclusively on modified versions of standard word alignment algorithms typically applied to large bilingual parallel corpora for building machine translation models (Liang et al., 2006; Och et al., 2000).",
        "Scores extracted from the alignments produced using these algorithms achieved fairly high classifi",
        "cation accuracy, but the somewhat weak alignment quality limited performance.",
        "In this paper, we compare these word alignment approaches to a new approach that uses traditionally-derived word alignments between retellings as the input for graph-based exploration of the alignment space in order to improve alignment accuracy.",
        "Using both earlier approaches and our novel method for word alignment, we then evaluate the accuracy of automated scoring and diagnostic classification for MCI.",
        "Although the alignment error rates for our data might be considered high in the context of building phrase tables for machine translation, the alignments produced using the graph-based method are remarkably accurate given the small size of our training corpus.",
        "In addition, these more accurate alignments lead to gains in scoring accuracy and to classification performance approaching that of manually derived scores.",
        "This method for word alignment and score extraction is general enough to be easily adapted to other tests used in neuropsychological evaluation, including not only those related to narrative recall, such as the NEPSY Narrative Memory subtest (Korkman et al., 1998) but also picture description tasks, such as the Cookie Theft picture description task of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (Goodglass et al., 2001) or the Renfrew Bus Story (Glasgow and Cowley, 1994).",
        "In addition, this technique has the potential to improve word alignment for more general NLP tasks that rely on small corpora, such as multilingual word alignment or word alignment of comparable corpora."

      "heading": "2 Background",
      "text": [
        "The act of retelling or producing a narrative taps into a wide array of cognitive functions, not only memory but also language comprehension, language production, executive function, and theory of mind.",
        "The inability to coherently produce or recall a narrative is therefore associated with many different cognitive and developmental disorders, including dementia, autism (Tager-Flusberg, 1995), and language impairment (Dodwell and Bavin, 2008; Botting, 2002).",
        "Narrative tasks are widely used in neuropsychological assessment, and many commonly used instruments and diagnostic protocols include a task involving narrative recall or production (Korkman et al., 1998; Wechsler, 1997; Lord et al., 2002).",
        "In this paper, we focus on evaluating narrative recall within the context of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), the earliest clinically significant precursor of dementia.",
        "The cognitive and memory problems associated with MCI do not necessarily interfere with daily living activities (Ritchie and Touchon, 2000) and can therefore be difficult to diagnose using standard dementia screening tools, such as the Mini-Mental State Exam (Folstein et al., 1975).",
        "A definitive diagnosis of MCI requires an extensive interview with the patient and a family member or caregiver.",
        "Because of the effort required for diagnosis and the insensitivity of the standard screening tools, MCI frequently goes undiagnosed, delaying the introduction of appropriate treatment and remediation.",
        "Early and unobtrusive detection will become increasingly important as the elderly population grows and as research advances in delaying and potentially stopping the progression of MCI into moderate and severe dementia.",
        "Narrative recall tasks, such as the test used in research presented here, the Wechsler Logical Memory subtest (WLM), are often used in conjunction with other cognitive measures in attempts to identify MCI and dementia.",
        "Multiple studies have demonstrated a significant difference in performance on the WLM between subjects with MCI and typically ag-ing controls, particularly in combination with tests of verbal fluency and memory (Storandt and Hill, 1989; Peterson et al., 1999; Nordlund et al., 2005).",
        "The WLM can also serve as a cognitive indicator of physiological characteristics associated with symptomatic Alzheimers disease, even in the absence of previously reported dementia (Schmitt et al., 2000; Bennett et al., 2006).",
        "Some previous work on automated analysis of the WLM has focused on using the retellings as a source of linguistic data for extracting syntactic and phonetic features that can distinguish subjects with MCI from typically aging controls (Roark et al., 2011).",
        "There has been some work on automating scoring of other narrative recall tasks using unigram overlap (Hakkani-Tur et al., 2010), but Dunn et al. (2002) are among the only researchers to apply automated methods to scoring the WLM for the purpose of identifying dementia, using latent semantic analysis to measure the semantic distance between a retelling",
        "and the source narrative.",
        "Although scoring automation is not typically used in a clinical setting, the objectivity offered by automated measures is particularly important for tests like the WLM, which are often administered by practitioners working in a community setting and serving a diverse population.",
        "Researchers working on NLP tasks such as paraphrase extraction (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001), word-sense disambiguation (Diab and Resnik, 2002), and bilingual lexicon induction (Sahlgren and Karlgren, 2005), often rely on aligned parallel or comparable corpora.",
        "Recasting the automated scoring of a neuropsychological test as another NLP task involving the analysis of parallel texts, however, is a relatively new idea.",
        "We hope that the methods presented here will both highlight the flexibility of techniques originally developed for standard NLP tasks and attract attention to the wide variety of biomedical data sources and potential clinical applications for these techniques."

        "The CDR has high inter-annotator reliability (Morris, 1993) when conducted by trained experts.",

        "We expect that our decision to select as a new alignment the most frequent source word over the distribution of source words at the end of 1000 walks could be improved, since it does not allow for one-to-many mappings.",
        "In addition, it would be worthwhile to experiment with several posterior thresholds, both during the decoding step of the Berkeley aligner and in the graph edges.",
        "In order to produce a viable clinical screening tool, it is crucial that we incorporate speech recognition in the pipeline.",
        "Our very preliminary investigation into using ASR to generate transcripts for alignment seems promising and surprisingly robust to the problems that might be expected when working with noisy audio.",
        "In our future work, we also plan to examine longitudinal data for individual subjects to see whether our techniques can detect subtle differences in recall and coherence between a recent retelling and a series of earlier baseline retellings.",
        "Since the metric commonly used to quantify the progression of dementia, the Clinical Dementia Rating, relies on observed changes in cognitive function over time, longitudinal analysis of performance on the Wechsler Logical Memory task may be the most promising application for our research."
