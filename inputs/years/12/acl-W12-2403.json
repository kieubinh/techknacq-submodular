        "This is also a great advantage for systems designed for instance for text mining, terminology structuring and alignment, or for more specific tasks such as pharmacovigilance.",
        "The pharmacovigilance area covers the identification of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in order to improve the vigilance on the health products.",

        "MedDRA is a relatively fine-grained terminology with nearly 90,000 terms.",
        "This means that a given pharmacovigilance report can be coded with different terms which have close meaning (Fescharek et al., 2004), like muscle pain and muscle ache or headache and cephalgia: although formally different the terms from these pairs have the same meaning.",
        "The difficulty is then to detect their semantic closeness.",
        "Indeed, if this semantic information is available, reports from the phramacovigilance data-banks and mentionning similar adverse events can be aggregated: the safety signal is intensified and the safety regulation process is improved.",
        "In order to aggregate the pharmacovigilance reports, several types of semantic information from MedDRA are used: (1) different hierarchical levels of MedDRA between the five levels available; (2) the SMQs (Standardized MedDRA Queries) which group together terms associated to a given medical condition such as Acute renal failure, Angioedema or Embolic and thrombotic events; and (3) specific resources (Bousquet et al., 2005; Iavindrasana et al., 2006; Alecu et al., 2008; Jaulent and Alecu, 2009).",
        "The SMQs are defined by groups of experts through a long and meticulous work consisting of the manual study of the MedDRA structure and of the analysis of the scientific literature (CIOMS, 2004).",

        "We will perform an exhaustive analysis of the nature of semantic relations which can be observed within the SMQs and propose other methods to further improve the coverage of the clusters.",

        "The results will also be evaluation by several experts, which will allow to assess the inter-expert variation and its influence on the results.",
