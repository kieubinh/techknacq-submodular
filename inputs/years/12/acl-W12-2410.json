        "Biomedical domain information extraction has in recent years seen a shift from focus on the extraction of simple pairwise relations (Pyysalo et al., 2008; Tikk et al., 2010) towards the extraction of events, represented as structured associations of arbitrary numbers of participants in specific roles (Ananiadou et al., 2010).",
        "Domain event extraction has been popularized in particular by the BioNLP Shared Task (ST) challenges in 2009 and 2011 (Kim et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2011).",
        "While the BioNLP ST?09 emphasized protein interactions and regulatory relationships, the expressive event formalism can also be applied to the extraction of statements regarding the properties of individual proteins.",
        "Accordingly, the EPI (Epigenetics and Post-Translational Modifications) subchallenge of the BioNLP ST?11 provided corpora and competitive evaluations for the detection of epigenetics and post-translational modification (PTM) events, while the REL (Entity Relations) subchallenge covers structural and complex membership relations of proteins (Ohta et al., 2011b; Pyysalo et al., 2011).",
        "The complex memberships and domains define the physical nature of an individual protein, which is closely linked to its function and biological activity.",
        "Post-translational modifications alter and regulate this activity via structural or chemical changes induced by the covalent attachment of small molecules to the protein.",
        "In epigenetic regulation, gene expression is controlled by the chemical modification of DNA and the his-tone proteins supporting chromosomal DNA.",
        "All of these aspects are important for defining the biological role of a protein, and thus the EPI and REL tasks enable the development of text mining systems that can extract a more complete picture of the biomolecular reactions and relations than previously possible (cf. Table 1).",
        "Furthermore, previous work has shown promising results for improving event extraction by",
        "integration of ?static?",
        "entity relations (Pyysalo et al., 2009), in particular for the previously only available PTM event, phosphorylation (Van Landeghem et al., 2010).",
        "Information on protein modifications is available in general-purpose protein databases such as UniProt, and there are also a number of dedicated database resources covering such protein modifications (Wu and others, 2003; Lee et al., 2006; Li et al., 2009).",
        "While the automatic extraction of PTMs from text has also been considered in a number of earlier studies, these have primarily involved single PTM reactions extracted with special-purpose methods (Hu et al., 2005; Yuan et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2008).",
        "The EPI task and associated work (Ohta et al., 2010) were the first to target numerous PTM reactions in a general framework using retrainable extraction methods.",
        "The automatic detection of modification statements using keyword matching-based methods has been applied also in support of DNA methylation DB curation (Ongenaert et al., 2008; Fang et al., 2011).",
        "However, as for PTM, the EPI task and its preparatory efforts (Ohta et al., 2011a) were the first to consider DNA methylation using the general event extraction approach.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to extend the event extraction approach to PTM and DNA methylation event extraction to the scale of the entire available literature.",
        "The Turku Event Extraction System (TEES), first introduced for the BioNLP ST?09 (Bjo?rne et al., 2009), was updated and generalized for participation in the BioNLP ST?11, in which it had the best performance on both the EPI and REL challenges (Bjo?rne and Salakoski, 2011).",
        "With an F-score of 53.33% for the EPI and 57.7% for the REL task, it performed over 16 pp better than the next best systems, making it well suited for our study.",
        "We apply this system to the extraction of EPI events and REL relations from all PubMed abstracts and all PMC open access articles, using a pipeline of open source text mining tools introduced in Bjo?rne et al. (2010).",
        "We further process the result using a recently created bibliome-scale gene normalization dataset1.",
        "This normalization effort connects protein and gene mentions in text to their database IDs, a prerequi-1Data currently under review.",
        "site for effective use of text mining results for most bioinformatics applications.",
        "In addition to protein names, the EPI and REL challenges refer to the protein substructures, modifications and complexes, which we also need to normalize in order to determine the biological context of these events.",
        "In this work, we develop a number of rule-based algorithms for the normalization of such non-protein entities.",
        "With both proteins and other entities normalized, we can align the set of events extracted from the literature with biological databases containing annotations on protein features, such as UniProt.",
        "We can determine how many known and unknown features we have extracted from text, and what percentage of various protein feature annotations our text mining results cover.",
        "This association naturally also works in the other direction, as we can take a gene or protein and find yet unannotated post-translational modifications, domains, or other features from scientific articles, a promising use case for supporting biomedical database curation."
