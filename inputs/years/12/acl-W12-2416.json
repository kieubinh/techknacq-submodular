        "Manually annotating clinical document corpora to generate reference standards for Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems or Machine Learning (ML) is a time-consuming and labor-intensive endeavor.",
        "Although a variety of open source annotation tools currently exist, there is a clear opportunity to develop new tools and assess functionalities that introduce efficiencies into the process of generating reference standards.",
        "These features include: management of document corpora and batch as-signment, integration of machine-assisted verification functions, semi-automated cu-ration of annotated information, and support of machine-assisted pre-annotation.",
        "The goals of reducing annotator workload and improving the quality of reference standards are important considerations for development of new tools.",
        "An infrastructure is also needed that will support large-scale but secure annotation of sensitive clinical data as well as crowdsourcing which has proven successful for a variety of annotation tasks.",
        "We introduce the Extensible Human Oracle Suite of Tools (eHOST) http://code.google.com/p/ehost that provides such functionalities that when coupled with server integration offer an end-to-end solution to carry out small or large scale as well as crowd sourced annotation projects.",
        "1 Introduction Supervised learning methods benefit from a reference standard that is used to train and evaluate the performance of Natural Language Processing (NLP) or Machine Learning (ML) systems for information extraction and classification.",
        "Ideal-ly, generating a reference standard involves the review of more than one annotator with an accompanying adjudication step to resolve discrepancies (Roberts et al., 2007; Roberts et al., 2009).",
        "However, manual annotation of clinical, texts is time-consuming, expensive, and requires considerable effort.",
        "Reducing the time and costs required for manual annotation could be achieved by developing new tools that integrate methods to more efficiently annotate clinical texts and integrate a management interface that allows administration of large or small scale annotation projects.",
        "Such a tool could also integrate methods to pre-annotate entities such as noun phrases or clinical concepts mapped to a standard vocabulary.",
        "Efficiencies could be realized via reduction in human workload, modification of annotation tasks that could include crowd sourcing, and implementation of machine-assisted approaches.",
        "Typically annotation of clinical texts requires human reviewers to identify information classes of interest called ?markables?.",
        "These tasks may also require reviewers to assign attributes to those information classes and build relations between spans of annotated text.",
        "For each annotation task there may be one or many types of markables and each markable class may be associated with one or more spans of text and may include single or even multiple tokens.",
        "These tasks may occur simultaneously, or may also be done in different steps and by multiple review-ers.",
        "Furthermore, these activities require written guidelines that clearly explicate what infor",
        "mation to annotate, specifics about each markable class, such as how much information to include in annotated spans, or syntactic rules to provide further guidance on annotated spans.",
        "Annotation tasks may benefit by incorporating rules or guidelines as part of the annotation task itself in the form of machine-assisted verifica-tion.",
        "There are many annotation tools available, and the majority of them were designed for linguistic or gene annotation.",
        "Linguistic annotation tools such as Callisto and WordFreak are standalone clients suitable for small to medium scale tasks where collaborative effort is not empha-sized.",
        "Functionality integrated with eHOST was inspired by existing features of these tools with the intent of providing a more efficient means of reference standard generation in a large collaborative environment.",
        "One annotation tool called Knowtator, a plug-in for Prot?g?",
        "(Musen, M.A., et al. 1995) developed by Ogren (2006) has been widely used to annotate clinical texts and generate reference standards.",
        "However, no standalone system exists that can provide end users with the ability to manually or semi-automatically edit, curate, and easily navigate annotated information.",
        "There are also specific functionalities that are missing from open source annotation tools in the clinical and biomedical domains that would introduce efficiencies into manual annotation tasks.",
        "These functionalities include: annotation of clinical texts along with database storage of stand-off annotations, the ability to interactively annotate texts in a way that allows users to react to either pre-annotations imported from NLP or ML systems or use exact string matching across an active corpus to identify similar spans of text to those already annotated.",
        "Additionally, these systems do not generally support crowd sourcing, ma-chine-assisted pre-annotation or verification approaches integrated directly with the annotation tool.",
        "This paper discusses development of a prototype open source system designed to provide functionality that supports these activities and offers an end-to-end solution when coupled with server integration to reduce both annotator and administrative workload associated with reference standard.",
        "We introduce the Extensible Human Oracle Suite of Tools (eHOST) created with these expectations in mind.",
        "2 Background Our goal for these development efforts was to build a prototype open source system that improves upon existing tools by including new functions and refining capabilities available in other annotation tools.",
        "The resulting GUI interface provides a means of visually representing annotated information, its attributes, and relations between annotated mentions.",
        "These efforts also focused integrating various machine-assisted approaches that can be used to easily curate and navigate annotated information within a document corpus, pre-annotate information, and also verify annotations based on rules checks that correspond with annotation guidelines or linguistic and syntactic cues.",
        "The eHOST provides basic functionality including manual annotation of information representing markable classes and assignment of information attributes and relationships between markable classes.",
        "Annotations exported from eHOST are written using the XML format as Knowtator thus allowing integration of inputs and outputs to and from Knowtator and indirectly to Prot?g?",
        "3.3.1.",
        "Coupling eHOST with an integrated server package such as the one under development by the VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) called the Chart Administration Server for Patient Review (CASPR) provides one method of increasing efficiencies for small or large-scale annotation efforts that could also include crowd sourcing.",
        "2.1 System Features Development In the domains of computational linguistics and biomedical informatics various approaches that can be used to improve annotation efficiencies have been evaluated for a variety of tasks including information extraction and classifica-tion.",
        "While several methods may help reduce the time and costs required to create reference standards, one of the simplest approaches may include integrating machine-assisted methods to pre-annotate relevant spans of text allowing the annotator to add missing annotations, modify spans, or delete spurious annotations.",
        "Neveol (2011) evaluated use of automatic semantic pre",
        "annotation of PubMed queries.",
        "This study showed a significant reduction in the number of required annotations when using pre-annotations, reduction in annotation time with higher inter-annotator agreement.",
        "Pre-annotation using simple approaches such as regular expressions coupled with dictionaries (South et al., 2010a) based on the UMLS as a source of lexical knowledge (Friedman, 2001) and pre-annotation of information representing protected health information (South et al., 2010b).",
        "In both cases finding that annotators preferred particular types of pre-annotation over others, but improvements in reference standard quality occur when pre-annotation was provided.",
        "Others have explored the use of third party tools for the pre-annotation task for UMLS concepts (Savova, 2008) and pre-annotation using an algorithmic approach (Chapman, et al., 2007) combined with domain expert annotations reused for temporal relation annotation (Mowery, 2008).",
        "Savova (2008) suggests limited utility when a third party tool is used for pre-annotation and Mowery (2008) suggest that even with domain expert pre-annotations, additional features are required to discern temporality.",

        "In all three cases the resulting annotation set was of comparable quality to that derived from expert annotators.",
        "Wang et al., (2008) make general recommendations for best approaches to crowd sourcing that include closer interactions between human and machine methods in ways that more efficiently connect domain expertise with the annotation task.",
        "Subsequent sections in this paper walk the reader through the various basic and advanced features eHOST provides.",
        "These features have been developed in a way that provides flexibility to add additional modules that support improvements in annotation workflow and efficiency for a variety of annotation scenarios applicable to computational linguistics and biomedical informatics.",
        "Some of these features may be useful for crowd-sourced efforts whereas others may simply represent an improvement in the way annotation is visualized or how manual effort can be reduced.",

        "These reports and the editor window display can also be used to quickly train annotators on new clinical domains using a reference standard created by domain experts for training purposes.",
        "Using these features error analysis can also be done by importing outputs from an NLP system that have been converted into the XML format used by eHOST."

        "chine-Assisted verification is most useful when used on lexical or syntax rules to ensure that candidate phrases generated by automated systems are similar to those marked by humans.",
        "These rules rely more on adherence to patterns than on decision-making, so the strengths of human review with machine approaches to semi-automated verification can be leveraged.",
        "When identifying medical concepts, it is common that noun phrases are marked as candidates.",
        "The determination of how much of a noun phrase to mark (inclusion of articles, adjectives, noun-modifiers, prepositional phrases) and at what granularity (simple nouns or complex noun phrases) may vary with each project.",
        "The verifier allows portions of an annotation guideline to be programmed into rules that check for consistency.",
        "Rules check whether a word appears within a user-defined window before and after an annotation.",
        "Each rule can be linked to text that describes why the annotation was flagged.",
        "Annotators are then provided suggestions on the correct span based on the rule.",
        "Us-ing the surrounding text, the guideline text, and the suggestion, the annotator can determine the final span for an annotation.",
        "These machine-assisted verifier functions help support reference standard generation by providing the context of annotations that seem to fail syntactic and lexical rules while allowing human annotators to focus on domain expertise required to identify and classify information found in clinical texts.",
        "Conclusion Our prototype system provides functionalities that have been created to more efficiently support reference standard generation including ma-chine-assisted annotation approaches.",
