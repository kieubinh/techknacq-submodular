        "EBM requires to identify the best evidence, understand the methodology and strength of the approaches reported in the evidence, and bring relevant findings into clinical practice.",
        "Davidoff et al. (1995) express EBM in terms of five related ideas.",
        "Their ideas imply that the conclusions should be derived based on the best evidence available, the clinical decisions should be made based on the conclusions derived, and the performance of the clinical decisions should be evaluated constantly.",
        "Thus, physicians practicing EBM should be constantly aware of the new ideas and the best methodologies available based on the most recent literature.",
        "But the amount of clinical documents available is increasing everyday.",
        "For example, Pubmed, a service of the US National Library of Medicine contains more than 21 million citations for biomedical literature from MEDLINE, life science journals, and online books (last updated on December 7, 2011) 1.",
        "The abundance of digital information makes difficult the task of evaluating the quality of results presented and the significance of the conclusions drawn.",
        "Thus, it has become an important task to grade the quality of evidence so that the most significant evidence is incorporated into the clinical practices.",
        "There are several scale systems available to grade medical evidence.",
        "Some of them are: hierarchy of evidence proposed by Evans (2003), Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) scale by GRADE (2004), and Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) scale by Ebell et al. (2004).",
        "The SORT scale addresses the quality, quantity, and consistency of evidence and proposes three levels of ratings: A, B, and C. Grade A is recommended based on the consistent, good-quality patient-oriented evidence, grade B is based on the inconsistent or limited-quality patient-oriented evidence, and grade C is based on consensus, disease-oriented evidence, usual practice, expert opinion or case studies.",
        "The Australasian Language Technology Association (ALTA) 2011 organized the shared task competition2 to build an automatic evidence grading system for EBM based on the SORT grading scale.",
        "We carry out our experiments using the data set provided for the competition and compare the accuracy of grading the evidence by applying basic approaches and an ensemble (stacking) based approach of classification.",
        "We show that the later approach can achieve 73.77% of grading accuracy, a significant improvement over the basic approaches.",
        "We further extend our experiments to show that, using feature sets generated from the method and conclusion sections of the abstracts helps to obtain higher accuracy in evidence grading than using a feature set generated from the entire body of the abstracts."

        "They applied a three way classification approach where the instances classified as A or C were removed from the test set and labeled as such, while instances classified as B were passed to the next classifier in the pipeline.",
        "They repeated this process until they reached the end of three sequential classifiers.",

        "This paper presents an approach of grading the medical evidence applying a stacking based classifier using the features from publication types, MeSH terms, abstract body, and method, and conclusion sections of the abstracts.",
        "The results show that this approach achieves an accuracy of 73.77%, that is significantly better than the previously reported work.",
        "Here, we present two findings: 1) We show that the stacking based approach helps to obtain a better result in evidence grading than the basic approach of classification.",
        "2) We also show that the method and conclusion sections of the abstracts contain important information necessary for evidence grading.",
        "Using the feature sets generated from these two sections helps to achieve a higher accuracy than by using the feature set generated from the entire body of the abstracts.",
        "In this work, all the information available in the method and conclusion sections of the abstracts is treated with equal weight.",
        "Evidence grading should not depend upon specific disease names and syndromes, but should be based on how strong the facts are presented.",
        "We would like to extend our approach by removing the words describing specific disease names, disease syndromes, and medications, and giving higher weight to the terms that describe the assertion of the statements.",
        "In our current work, we apply a simple approach to extract the method and conclusion sections from the abstracts not having sections.",
        "Improving the approach by using a machine learning algorithm that can more accurately extract the sections might help to increase the accuracy of grading.",
        "Including the information about the strength of assertions made in the conclusion sections could also help in boosting the accuracy.",
        "Future work would also include testing the effectiveness of our approach on other diverse data sets having complex structures of the evidence, or on a different grading scale."
