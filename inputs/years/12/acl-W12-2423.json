        "With the rapidly increasing biomedical literature, text mining has become popular for finding biomedical information in text.",
        "Among others, named entity recognition (NER) for bio-entities such as genes and proteins is a fundamental task because extracting biological relationships begins with entity identification.",
        "However, NER in biomedical literature is challenging due to the irregularities and ambiguities in bio-entities nomenclature (Yang et al., 2008).",
        "In particular, compound entity names make this problem difficult because it also requires deciding word boundaries.",
        "Recent bio-text competitions such as JNLPBA (Kim et al., 2004) and BioCreative (Lu et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2008) have evaluated NER systems for gene mentions.",
        "Even though progress has been made in several areas, gene identification methods are not yet sufficient for real-world use without human interaction (Arighi et al., 2011).",
        "Thus, at the present, a realistic suggestion is to use these algorithms as an aid to human curation and information retrieval (Altman et al., 2008).",
        "In this paper, we define a new task, gene/protein sentence classification.",
        "A gene or protein sentence means a sentence including at least one specific gene or protein name.",
        "This new task has advantages over gene mention identification.",
        "First, gene name boundaries are not important at the sentence level and human judges will agree more in their judgments.",
        "Second, highlighting gene sentences may be more useful in manual search and browsing environments since this can be done more accurately and with less distraction from incorrect annotations.",
        "To classify gene/protein sentences, we here propose an ensemble approach to combine different NER identifiers.",
        "Previous NER approaches are mostly developed on a small number of gold",
        "standard sets including GENIA (Kim et al., 2003) and BioCreative (Smith et al., 2008) corpora.",
        "These sets help to find regular name patterns in a limited set of articles, but also limit the NER performance for real-world use.",
        "In the proposed approach, we use a Semantic Model and a Priority Model along with BANNER (Leaman and Gonzalez, 2008).",
        "The Semantic and Priority Models are used to provide more robust performance on gene/protein sentence classification because they utilize larger resources such as SemCat and Pub-Med?R to detect gene names.",
        "For experiments, we created three new gold-standard sets to include cases appearing in the most recent publications.",
        "The experimental results show that our approach outperforms machine learning classifiers using unigrams and substring features as well as standalone BANNER classification on five gold-standard datasets.",

        "While BANNER shows good performance on well-known gold-standard sets, it suffers from relatively poor performance on unknown examples.",
        "To overcome this problem, we combine BANNER with two other predictors, a Sematic Model and a Priority Model.",
        "First, the Semantic Model and the Priority Model do not use previous gold-standard sets for training.",
        "Second, these two models learn name patterns in different ways, i.e., semantic relationships for the Semantic Model and positional and lexical information for the Priority Model.",
        "This combination of a strong predictor and two weaker but more general predictors can respond better to unknown name patterns.",
        "As described above, the proposed method mainly relies on outputs from different NER methods, whereas word features can still provide useful evidence for discriminating gene and non-gene sentences.",
        "Hence, we alternatively utilize word features such as unigrams and substrings along with NER features.",
        "For NER features only, the output is the sum of binary decisions from three NER modules.",
        "For word and NER features, the Huber classifier (Kim and Wilbur, 2011) is trained to combine the features.",
