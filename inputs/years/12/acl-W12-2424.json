        "Patient health records are maintained securely according to the provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).",
        "Investigators must obtain informed consent from patients whose data will be used for other purposes.",
        "This means defining which data will be used and how they will be used.",
        "In addition to writing protocols and obtaining consent from patients, medical experts must either manually codify important information or teach a machine how to do it.",

        "Our research focuses on answering difficult neuropsychiatric questions such as, ?Who is at higher risk of dying by suicide??",
        "or ?Who is a good candidate for epilepsy surgery evaluation??",
        "Large amounts of data that might answer these questions exist in the form of text dictated by clinicians or written by patients and thus unavailable.",
        "Parallel to the collection of such data, we explored whether small datasets can be used to build reliable methods of making this information available.",
        "Here, we investigate how text classification training size relates to certain aspects of linear support vector machines.",
        "We hypothesize that a sufficiently large training subset will generate stable and reliable performance estimates of a classifier.",
        "On the other hand, if the dataset is too small, then even small changes to the training size will change the performance of a classifier and manifest unstable and unreliable estimates.",
        "We introduce quantitive definitions for stability and reliability and give empirical evidence on how they work."

        "How much data is needed for reliable and stable analysis?",
        "This question has been answered for most univariate problems, and a few solutions exist for multivariate problems, but no widely accepted answer is available for sparse and high-dimensional data.",
        "Nonetheless, we will review the few sample size calculation methods that have been used for machine learning.",
        "Hsieh et al. (1998) described a method for calculating the sample size needed for logistic and linear regression models.",
        "The multivariate problem was simplified to a series of univariate two-sample t-tests on the input variables.",
        "A variance inflation factor was used to correct for the multidimensionality which quantifies the severity of multicollinearity in the least squares regression: collinearity deflates and non-collinearity inflates sample size estimation.",
        "Computer simulations were done on low-dimensional and continuous data, so it is not known whether the method is applicable to text categorization.",
        "Guyon et al. (1998) addressed the problem of determining what size test set guarantees statistically significant results in a character recognition task, as a function of the expected error rate.",
        "This method does not assume which learner will be used.",
        "Instead, it requires specific parameters that describe handwriting data collection properties such as between-writers variance and within-writer variance.",
        "The downside of this method is that it must assume the worst-case scenario: a large variance in data and a low error rate for the classifier.",
        "For this reason larger datasets are recommended.",
        "Dobbin et al. (2008) and Jianhua Hu (2005) focused only on sample size for a classifier that learns from gene expression data.",
        "No assumptions were made about the classifier, only about the data structure.",
        "All gene expressions were measured on a continuous scale that denotes some luminescence corresponding to the relative abundance of nucleic acid sequences in the target DNA strand.",
        "The data, regardless of size, can be qualified using just one parameter, fold change, which measures changes in the expression level of a gene under two different conditions.",
        "Furthermore, the fold change can be standardized for compatibility with other biological experiments: with a lower standardized fold change, more samples are needed, and with more genes, more samples are needed.",
        "There is a strong assumption about data makeup, but no assumption is made about the classifier.",
        "This solution allows for small sample sizes but does not generalize to text classification data.",
        "Way et al. (2010) evaluated the performance of various classifiers and featured a selection technique in the presence of different training sample sizes.",
        "Experiments were conducted on synthetic data, with two classes drawn from multivariate Gaussian distributions with unequal means and either equal or unequal covariance matrices.",
        "The conclusion was that support vector machines with a radial kernel performed slightly better than the LDA when the training sample size was small.",
        "Only certain combinations of feature selection and classification methods work well with small sample sizes.",
        "We will use similar assumptions for sparse and high-dimensional data.",
        "Most recently, Juckett (2012) developed a method for determining the number of documents needed for a gold standard corpus.",
        "The sample size calculation was based on the concept of capture probabilities.",
        "It is defined as the normalized sum of probabilities over all words of interest.",
        "For example, if the required capture probability is 0.95 for a set of medical words, when using larger corpora that contain these words, it must first be calculated how many documents are needed to capture the same probability in the target corpus.",
        "This method is specific to linguistic research on annotated corpora, where the probabilities of individual words in the sought corpora must match the probabilities of words in the target domain.",
        "This method focuses solely on the data structure and does not assume an algorithm or the task that it will serve.",
        "The downside is a higher sample size.",
        "When reviewing various methods for sample size calculation, we found that as more assumptions can be made, fewer data are needed for meaningful analysis.",
        "Assumptions can be made about data structure and quality, the task the data serve, feature selection, and the classifier.",
        "Our approach exploits a scenario where the task, the feature selection, and the classifier are known."

        "Moreover, we now have a new direction for thinking about optimizing classification algorithms: instead of focusing solely on accuracy, we can also measure the dispersion and see whether this is a better indicator of what would happen with unevaluated data.",

        "Reliability dispersion measures indirectly whether the decision hyperplane is always similar and how much it varies, while stability dispersion measures how well we are generalizing and how much variability there is.",
        "If the sample size is large enough, we should always get the same decision hyperplane with the same generalization accuracy.",
        "With little empirical evidence, we can conclude that classifier performance measured by just a single K in a cross-validation test is not sufficient.",
        "K must be be varied, and other measures must be present, such as the SVM reliability index, that support or contradict the generalization accuracy estimates.",
        "We suggest that other measures for sample size calculation and algorithm tuning may exist and there is still much to be learned about the mechanics of support vector machines."
