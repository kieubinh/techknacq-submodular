        "Although in news articles and other formal writing it is typical to mention a person by the last name (e.g., Obama rather than Barack) as long as the referent is clear, stories, conversations, and other less formal genres would make more frequent use of first names of individuals for re-mention compared to other genres.",
        "Because the importance of coreference resolution is not limited to formal writing, coreference resolution systems need to incorporate name-specific knowledge, either in preprocessing stages such as parsing and NER or in coreference resolution after the preprocessing.",
        "Error (4) is not as undesirable as the other ones: Even for a human annotator, it is more difficult to make a coreference decision for a case like this one, in which the fact that the salad-eating lady was shocked would come about similarly for any frog, not just Froggy.",
