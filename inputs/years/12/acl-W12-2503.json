        "What is the role of textual features above the sentence level in advancing the machine translation of literature?",
        "This paper examines how referential cohesion is expressed in literary and non-literary texts and how this cohesion affects translation.",
        "We first show in a corpus study on English that literary texts use more dense reference chains to express greater referential cohesion than news.",
        "We then compare the referential cohesion of machine versus human translations of Chinese literature and news.",
        "While human translators capture the greater referential cohesion of literature, Google translations perform less well at capturing literary cohesion.",
        "Our results suggest that incorporating discourse features above the sentence level is an important direction for MT research if it is to be applied to literature.",
        "Introduction The concept of literary machine translation might seem at first to be a near-contradiction in terms.",
        "The field of machine translation has traditionally aimed its sights at the translation of technical or otherwise informative texts, with the strongest focus on newswire and other informative texts relevant to the goals of government funders.",
        "Nevertheless, the prospect of literary MT is appealing.",
        "Human translation of literary texts is an extremely time-and money-intensive task, but one that is a crucial element of the global system of transcultural literary exchange.",
        "From a technical standpoint, since ?by definition, literature is the art that uses language?",
        "(Chapman 1973), literary translation represents perhaps the strongest formulation of the machine translation problem.",
        "Jonathan Slocum, writing in 1985, essentially rejects the idea of literary MT altogether, noting that it is serendipitous for technical MT that emphasis is placed on semantic fidelity to the source text, whereas literary translation must take into account larger considerations such as style with which ?computers do not fare well.?",
        "Given the explosion of statistical methodologies in MT, are we now at a point where we can hope to begin tackling some of the questions associated with a potential literary machine translation?",
        "This problem is severely understudied.",
        "Regardless of the plausibility (or even desirability) of eventually using MT to produce full-fledged translations of literary texts, a serious consideration of the unique difficulties posed by literary translation may well serve to push forward our computational understanding of literature and the language of translation.",
        "In particular, literary translation seems to demand that we address larger-scale textual features beyond the sentence-level approach commonly employed by contemporary MT systems.",
        "There is a substantial body of work by scholars in the field of translation studies addressing greater-than-sentence-level textual features from a linguistic and literary-theoretical perspective, and this existing work can offer conceptual understanding and a parallel vocabulary with which to discuss progress in this regard in machine translation.",
        "Eugene Nida (1964), for example, used the terms ?formal equivalence?",
        "and ?dynamic equivalence?",
        "to differentiate between translations aiming to replicate the form of their source and those aiming to replicate the source text's effects on its readers.",
        "Hatim and Mason (1995) brought the ?seven standards of textuality?",
        "set forth by Beaugrande and Dressler (1981) into the translation studies context as metrics for evaluating the ?expectation-fulfilling?",
        "or ?expectation-defying?",
        "outcome of a translated text.",
        "Cohesion is defined by Beaugrande and Dressler as ?concern[ing] the ways in which the components of the textual world, i.e., the configuration of concepts and relations which underlie the surface text, are mutually accessible and relevant.\" Cohesion considers the limited human capacity for storing the ?surface materials?",
        "of a text long enough to relate them semantically during the act of reading.",
        "We therefore propose to study referential cohesion (Halliday and Hasan 1976), the relation between co-referring entities in a narrative, as an important component of cohesion.",
        "Referential cohesion has a significant literature in natural language processing (Grosz et al. 1995, Mani et al. 1998, Marcu 2000, Karamanis et al. 2004, Kibble and Power 2004, Elsner and Charniak 2008, Barzilay and Lapata 2008, inter alia) as does automatic coreference resolution, which has significantly increased in accuracy in recent years (Bengston and Roth 2008, Haghighi and Klein 2009, Haghighi and Klein 2010, Rahman and Ng 2011, Pradhan et al. 2011, Lee et al. 2011).",
        "We formulate and test two hypotheses in this position paper: First, we anticipate that given stylistic considerations and their fundamental narrative function, prose literary texts are inherently ?more cohesive?",
        "than news.",
        "Second, in light of the aforementioned necessity for ?dynamic equivalence?",
        "in the literary translation, we anticipate that current machine translation systems, built with newswire texts in mind, will be less successful at conveying cohesion for literary texts than for news."
