        "The task of authorship attribution (for an overview cf. Stamatatos, 2009) is typically performed with superficial features of texts such as sentence length, word frequencies, and use of punctuation & vocabulary.",
        "While such methods attain high accuracies (e.g., Grieve, 2007), the models make purely statistical decisions that are difficult to interpret.",
        "To overcome this we could turn to higher-level patterns of texts, such as their syntactic structure.",
        "Syntactic stylometry was first attempted by Baayen et al. (1996), who looked at the distribution of frequencies of grammar productions.1 More recently, Raghavan et al. (2010) identified authors by deriving a probabilistic grammar for each author and picking the author grammar that can parse the unidentified",
        "text with the highest probability.",
        "There is also work that looks at syntax on a more shallow level, such as Hirst and Feiguina (2007), who work with partial parses; Wiersma et al. (2011) looked at n-grams of part-of-speech (POS) tags, and Menon and Choi (2011) focussed on particular word frequencies such as those of ?stop words,?",
        "attaining accuracies well above 90% even in cross-domain tasks.",
        "In this work we also aim to perform syntactic stylometry, but we analyze syntactic parse trees directly, instead of summarizing the data as a set of grammar productions or a probability measure.",
        "The unit of comparison is tree fragments.",
        "Our hypothesis is that the use of fragments can provide a more interpretable model compared to one that uses fine-grained surface features such as word tokens."

        "from authors with a putatively distinctive style.",
        "In order to analyze the syntactic structure of the corpus we use hierarchical phrase-structures, which divide sentences into a series of constituents that are represented in a tree-structure; cf. figure 1 for an example.",
        "We analyze phrase-structures using the notion of tree fragments (referred to as subset trees by Collins and Duffy, 2002).",
        "This notion is taken from the framework of Data-Oriented Parsing (Scha, 1990), which hypothesizes that language production and comprehension exploits an inventory of fragments from previous language experience that are used as building blocks for novel sentences.",
        "In our case we can surmise that literary authors might make use of a specific inventory in writing their works, which characterizes their style.",
        "Fragments can be characterized as follows: Definition.",
        "A fragment f of a tree T is a connected subset of nodes from T , with |f |?",
        "2, such that each node of f has either all or none of the children of the corresponding node in T .",
        "When a node of a fragment has no children, it is called a frontier node; in a parsing algorithm such nodes function as substitution sites where the fragment can be combined with other fragments.",
        "Cf. figure 2 for an example of a fragment.",
        "An important consideration is that fragments can be of arbitrary size.",
        "The notion of fragments captures anything from a single context-free production such as",
        "(1) S ?",
        "NP VP .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "to complete stock phrases such as (2) Come with me if you want to live.",
        "In other words, instead of making assumptions about grain size, we let the data decide.",
        "This is in contrast to n-gram models where n is an a priori defined sliding window size, which must be kept low because",
        "the translations are contemporaneous with the works of Conrad.",
        "of data-sparsity considerations.",
        "To obtain phrase-structures of the corpus we employ the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003), which is a treebank parser trained on the Wall Street journal (WSJ) section of the Penn treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "This unlexicalized parser attains an accuracy of 85.7 % on the WSJ benchmark (|w |?",
        "100).",
        "Performance is probably much worse when parsing text from a different domain, such as literature; for example dialogue and questions are not well represented in the news domain on which the parser is trained.",
        "Despite these issues we expect that useful information can be extracted from the latent hierarchical structure that is revealed in parse trees, specifically in how patterns in this structure recur across different texts.",
        "We pre-process all texts manually to strip away dedications, epigraphs, prefaces, tables of contents, and other such material.",
        "We also verified that no occurrences of the author names remained.2 Sentence and word-level tokenization is done by the Stanford parser.",
        "Finally, the parser assigns the most likely parse tree for each sentence in the corpus.",
        "No further training is performed; as our method is memory-based, all computation is done during classification.",
        "In the testing phase the author texts from the training sections are compared with the parse trees of texts to be identified.",
        "To do this we modified the fragment extraction algorithm of Sangati et al. (2010) to identify the common fragments among two different sets of parse trees.3 This is a tree kernel method (Collins and Duffy, 2002) which uses dynamic programming to efficiently extract the maximal fragments that two trees have in common.",
        "We use the variant reported by Moschitti (2006) which runs in average linear time in the number of nodes in the trees.",
        "To identify the author of an unknown text we collect the fragments which it has in common with each known author.",
        "In order to avoid biases due to different sizes of each author corpus, we use the first 15,000 sentences from each training section.",
        "From these results all fragments which were found in more than one author corpus are removed.",
        "The remaining fragments which are unique to each author are used to compute a similarity score.",
        "We have explored different variations of similarity scores, such as the number of nodes, the average number of nodes, or the fragment frequencies.",
        "A simple method which appears to work well is to count the total number of content words.4 Given the parse trees of a known author A and those of an unknown author B, with their unique common fragments denoted as A uB, the resulting similarity is defined as:",
        "However, while the number of sentences in the train-2Exception: War and Peace contains a character with the same name as its author.",
        "However, since this occurs in only one of the works, it cannot affect the results.",
        "verbs.",
        "They are identified by the part-of-speech tags that are part of the parse trees.",
        "ing sets has been fixed, they still diverge in the average number of words per sentence, which is reflected in the number of nodes per tree as well.",
        "This causes a bias because statistically, there is a higher chance that some fragment in a larger tree will match with another.",
        "Therefore we also normalize for the average number of nodes.",
        "The author can now be guessed as:",
        "Note that working with content words does not mean that the model reduces to an n-gram model, because fragments can be discontiguous; e.g., ?he said X but Y .?",
        "Furthermore the fragments contain hierarchical structure while n-grams do not.",
        "To verify this contention, we also evaluate our model with trigrams instead of fragments.",
        "For this we use trigrams of word & part-of-speech pairs, with words stemmed using Porter's algorithm.",
        "With trigrams we simply count the number of trigrams that one text shares with another.",
        "Raghavan et al. (2010) have observed that the lexical information in n-grams and the structural information from a PCFG perform a complementary role, achieving the highest performance when both are combined.",
        "We therefore also evaluate with a combination of the two."
