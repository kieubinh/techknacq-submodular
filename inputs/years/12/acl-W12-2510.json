        "In this paper, we focus on one such application: extraction of quotable phrases from books.",
        "Quotable phrase extraction can be used, among other things, for finding new original quotations for dictionaries and online quotation repositories, as well as for generating catchy previews for book advertisement.",
        "We develop a quotable phrase extraction process that includes sentence segmentation, unsupervised sentence filtering based on a quotable language model, and a supervised quotable phrase detection using lexical and syntactic features.",
        "Our evaluation demonstrates that this process can be used for high-precision quotable phrase extraction, especially in applications that can tolerate lower recall.",
        "A study using a reddit community of quote enthusiasts as well as a simple corpus analysis further demonstrate the practical applications of our work.",
