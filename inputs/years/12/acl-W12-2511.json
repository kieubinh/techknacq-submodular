        "SRL has been successfully used in machine translation, summari-zation and information extraction.",
        "In order to build robust SRL systems there is a need for significant resources the most important of which are semantically annotated resources such as proposition banks.",
        "Several such resources exist now for different languages including FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), VerbNet (Kipper et al. 2000) and PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005).",
        "These resources have marked a surge in efficient approaches to automatic SRL of the English language.",
        "Apart from English, there exist various PropBank projects in Chinese (Xue et al., 2009), Korean (Palmer et al. 2006) and Hindi (Ashwini et al., 2011).",
        "These resources exist on a large scale spearheading the SRL research in the associated languages (Carreras and Marquez, 2005), Surdeanu et al. (2008).",

        "Apart from the modesty in size, the Arabic language genre used in the APB does not represent the full scope of the Arabic language.",
        "The Arabic culture has a long history of literary writing and a rich linguistic heritage in classical Arabic.",
        "In fact all historical religious non-religious texts are written in Classical Arabic.",

        "The main goal behind this project is to extend coverage of the existing Arabic PropBank (APB) to more verbs and genres (Zaghouani et al. 2010; Diab et al. 2008).",
        "APB is limited to the newswire domain in modern standard Arabic (MSA).",
        "It significantly lags behind the English PropBank (EPB) in size.",
        "EPB consists of 5413 verbs corresponding to 7268 different verb senses, the APB only covers 2127 verb types corresponding to 2657 different verb senses.",
        "According to El-Dahdah (2008) Arabic Dictionary, there are more than 16,000 verbs in the Arabic language.",
        "The Quran corpus comprises a total of 1466 verb types including 810 not present in APB.",
        "Adding the 810 verbs to the APB is clearly a significant boost to the size of the APB (38% amounting to 2937 verb types).",
        "In the current paper however we address the annotation of the Quran as a stand alone resource while leveraging our experience in the APB annotation process.",
        "The Quran consists of 1466 verb types corresponding to 19,356 verb token instances.",
        "The language of the Quran is Classical Arabic (CA) of 77,430 words, sequenced in chapters and verses, dating back to over 1431 years.",
        "It is considered a reference text on both religious as well as linguistic matters.",
        "The language is fully specified with vocalic and pronunciation markers to ensure faithful oration.",
        "The language is poetic and literary in many instances with subtle allusions (Zahri 1990).",
        "It is the source of many other religious and heritage writings and a book of great importance to muslims worldwide, including non speakers of Arabic.",
        "Dukes and Buckwalter (2010) started the Quranic Arabic Corpus, an annotated linguistic resource which marks the Arabic grammar, syntax and morphology for each word.",
        "The QATB provides two levels of analysis: morphological annotation and syntactic representation.",
        "The syntax of traditional Arabic grammar is represented in the Quranic Treebank using hybrid dependency graphs as shown in Figure 1.1 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first PropBank annotation of a religious and literary style text.",
        "The new verbs added from the Quran are also common verbs widely used today in MSA but the Quranic context adds more possible senses to these verbs.",
        "Having a QAPB allows for a more semantic level of analysis to the Quran.",
        "Currently the Quranic Corpus Portal2 comprises morphological annotations, syntactic treebanks, and a semantic ontology.",
        "Adding the QAPB will render it a unique source for Arabic language scholars worldwide (more than 50,000 unique visitors per day).",
        "Linguistic studies of the Quranic verbs such as verbal alternations, verb valency, polysemy and verbal ambiguity are one of the possible research directions that could be studied with this new resource.",
        "On the other hand, the Arabic NLP research community will benefit from the increased coverage of the APB verbs, and the new domain covered (religious) and the new writing style (Quranic Arabic).",
        "Furthermore, Quranic citations are commonly used today in MSA written texts (books, newspapers, etc.",
        "), as well as Arabic social media intertwined with dialectal writings.",
        "This",
        "makes the annotation of a Quranic style a rare and relevant resource for the building of Arabic NLP applications."

        "In the future plans, the corpus will cover eventually all the 1466 verbs in the whole Quranic corpus.",

        "Once a predicate (in this case a verb) is chosen, framer-look at an average sample size of 60-70 instances per predicate found in the Quranic corpus in order to get an idea of its syntactic behavior.",
        "Based on these observations and their linguistic knowledge and native-speaker intuition, the framers create a Frame File for each verb containing one or more framesets, which correspond to coarse-grained senses of the predicate lemma.",

        "The Arabic root-meaning search tool is freely available online.",
        "The search is done by root, the tool displays all possible meanings separated by a comma with citation examples from many sources including the Quran.",
        "Once the Frame files are created, the data that have the identified predicate occurrences are passed on to the annotators for a double-blind annotation process using the previously created framesets.",
        "Each PropBank entry represents a particular instance of a verb in a particular sentence in the Treebank and the mapping of numbered roles to precise meanings is given on a verb-by-verb basis in a set of frames files during the annotation procedure.",
        "To ensure consistency, the data is double annotated and finally adjudicated by a third annotator.",
        "The adjudicator resolves differences between the two annotations if present to produce the gold annotation.",
        "A sample Frameset and a related annotation example from the QAPB are shown in Table 1.",
        "During the annotation process, the data is organized by verb such that each verb with all its instances is annotated at once.",
        "In doing so, we firstly ensure that the framesets of similar verbs, and in turn, the annotation of the verbs, will both be consistent across the data.",
        "Secondly, by tackling annotation on a verb-by-verb basis, the annotators are able to concentrate on a single verb at a time, making the process easier and faster for the annotators."
