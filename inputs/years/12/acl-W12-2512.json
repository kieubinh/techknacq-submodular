        "and ?good made make great?).",
        "Below is a sample of the topic keys for the first 20 topics: black satin green jet; trimmed satin skirt dress; skirt made skirts hips; silk black long jet; brown gray blue dark; white tulle dress low; worn ladies young made; de black white soie; flannel worn warm skirts; dress costumes white blue; blue pink white pale; satin velvet lace brocade; price shown centre set; plain figures shown designs; yard cents sold cost ;",
        "At first, the topic with the highest percentage for each volume was chosen, along with its topic keys.",
        "Then every year for which this is the number one topic was found.",
        "Some topics will be associated with the same year a number of times, because each year contains roughly 52 volumes each of which has a topic distribution.",
        "The number of times each year shows up in each number one topic was counted and plotted (Figure 1).",
        "This allows one to see which topics are strongly correlated with a particular year or set of years, and from here it may be possible to deduce which topics are most representative of trends by year.",
        "Some keys (e.g. ?cost made black ladies?)",
        "are very general, uninformative and infrequent.",
        "Others occur several times in one year and not in any other year (e.g. ?costumes costume style trimming?).",
        "Then there are topics that occur frequently over a short range of years (e.g. ?dresses skirt plain wool?).",
        "And still other, such as ?fur seal skin black?",
        "that occur infrequently over a vast range of years, vs those that occur infrequently over a short range of years, ?flannel worn warm skirts?.",
        "The most relevant topics are the ones that occur frequently over a short range of time.",
        "These are topics that may be representative of trends, and it would be helpful to plot the distribution of such topics over time."

        "Due to the large amount of data generated by the 100-topic model, a 20-topic model was generated to provide a more thorough analysis of the data.",

        "This might lead to less fine-grained topics for the data.",
        "Some topics clearly stand out as having a very high frequency for a short range of years (e.g. ?made gown skirt gowns?).",
        "Next, the distribution of a sample of topics was plotted by year.",
        "This was done by following each topic separately over time; the percent of the topic in the distribution for each year was plotted by year.",
        "Since every year has many topic distributions (corresponding to each of the 52 volumes per year for most years) a bootstrapping sampling method was performed to determine the percentage associated with a specific topic and year.",
        "Bootstrapping provides the advantage of a weighted average that correctly preserves the original distribution.",
        "A percent from the topic percent-pool for the year was chosen randomly 1,000 times and averaged to produce one single percent associated with that topic and year.",
        "The most frequently occurring topics are ?Silk long made back?",

        "It appears that the topic keys generated by the 100- topic model are more relevant and contain more information than those generated by the 20-topic model.",
        "On the other hand the 20-topic model is simpler to analyze.",
        "Therefore, inspired by the work on Martha Ballard's diary [4] another model was generated with 20 topic keys for each of 20 topics.",
        "These labels were plotted by year, and topics with the most movement are shown (Figure 3).",
        "There are trends here that clearly stand out, but there does not seem to be enough data to follow the trends through to the end.",
        "Certain topics rise in popularity and fall again, however, it is impossible to know from 30 years of data if they rise again further in time.",
        "Similarly to the 20-topic model with 4 topic keys, many topics stand out due to their cyclic nature.",
        "However unlike the 4-topic keys model, rises and dips in frequency are more dramatic, suggesting that more topic keys leads to a more thorough analysis of trends.",

        "Highlighted topic keys describe real trends and provide a starting point for further analysis.",
        "Not surprisingly, frequent topics coincide with the most highly peaking and oscillating topics in Figure 3.",
        "These frequent topics also depict more fashion trends, as defined by the categories mentioned above.",
        "For example, below is a non-frequent topic, and it does not include a single topic key that falls into the categories defined above: 2 hair head price natural cents large fancy pretty long ladies hand lady box made cards dolls water children good dressed."

        "Topic modeling for 19th century magazine data does not automatically yield relevant topics that can be plotted and analyzed.",

        "It is important to correctly classify topic keys and identify useless topics.",
        "It seems to be the case that more topics and more topic keys yield better results; which may then be obtained by carefully sorting through the 100-topic model and categorizing topic keys into topic labels, then plotting them by year to analyze trends.",
        "It may be possible with more detailed analyses to deduce topic keys that are cyclic in nature when put in context (e.g. ?back?",
        "in Figure 2).",
        "A heat map can be a good way to weed out uninteresting topics.",
        "It also provides an excellent visualization method for the rise and fall of topics, as well as topic cyclicality.",
        "Based on these highlighted topics, it is interesting to group the topic keys by characteristic (e.g., color, article of clothing, construction, technique, material etc).",

        "Honing in on specific topic categories (e.g. articles of clothing, materials, colors and styles) can help illuminate trends.",
