        "In recent years, the wide availability of digitized literary works has given rise to a computational approach to analyzing these texts.",
        "This approach has been used, sometimes in conjunction with more traditional literary analysis techniques, to better grasp the intricacies of several literary works.",
        "As the field matured, new approaches and ideas gave rise to the use of techniques, like social networks, usually reserved for quantitive fields in order to gain new insights into the works.",
        "Recently, Elson et al. (2010) extracted networks from a corpus of 19th century texts in order to debunk long standing hypotheses from comparative literature (Elson et al., 2010).",
        "Moretti (2011) examined a social event network constructed from Hamlet in order to delve deeper into its infamously dense character network.",
        "While this approach is clearly powerful, it is not without drawbacks.",
        "As Moretti (2011) points out, undirected and unweighted networks are blunt instruments and limited in their use.",
        "While, as discussed below, some researchers have sought to rectify these limitations, few have done so with a strict and specific rubric for categorizing interactions.",
        "In this paper, we annotate Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland using a well-defined annotation scheme which we have previously developed on newswire text Agarwal et al. (2010).",
        "It is well suited to deal with the aforementioned limitations.",
        "We show that using different types of networks can be useful by allowing us to provide a model for determining point-of-view.",
        "We also show that social networks allow characters to be categorized into roles based on how they function in the text, but that this approach is limited when using static social networks.",
        "We then build and visualize dynamic networks and show that static networks can distort the importance of characters.",
        "By using dynamic networks, we can build a fuller picture of how each character works in a literary text.",
        "Our paper uses an annotation scheme that is well-defined and has been used in previous computational models that extract social events from news articles (Agarwal and Rambow, 2010).",
        "This computational model may be adapted to extract these events from literary texts.",
        "However, the focus of this paper is not to adapt the previously proposed computational model to a new domain or genre, but to first demonstrate the usefulness of this annotation scheme for the analysis of literary texts, and the social networks derived from it.",
        "All results reported in this paper are based on hand annotation of the text.",
        "Furthermore, we are investigating a single text, so that we do cannot draw conclusions about the usefulness of our methods for validating theories of literature.",
        "We summarize the contributions of this paper: ?",
        "We manually extract a social network from Al",
        "ice in Wonderland based on the definition of social events as proposed by us in (Agarwal et al., 2010).",
        "?",
        "We use static network analysis (in a bottom-up approach) for creating character sketches.",
        "We show that exploiting the distinction between different types of social events (interaction and observation), we are able to gain insights into the roles characters play in this novel.",
        "?",
        "We point certain limitations of the static network analysis and propose the use of dynamic network analysis for literary texts.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we present previous work.",
        "In Section 3, we present a brief overview of social events.",
        "In Section 4, we discuss the data and annotation scheme.",
        "In Section 6, we present results on static network analysis, and results on dynamic network analysis in Section 7.",

        "The power of network analysis in the field of literature is evidenced by the rapid rise of work and interest in the field in recent years.",
        "Network extraction and analysis has been performed on subjects as varied as the Marvel universe (Alberich et al., 2002), Les Mise?rables (Newman and Girvan, 2004), and ancient Greek tragedies (Rydberg-Cox, 2011).",
        "Elson et al. (2010) has looked at debunking comparative literature theories by examining networks for sixty 19th-century novels.",
        "Elson et al. (2010) used natural language processing techniques to attribute quoted speech to characters in the novels, and then used this data to create networks that allowed the researchers to make novel observations about the correlation between setting and the number of characters.",
        "Because the study was limited to quoted speech, however, a large chunk of interactions (such as non-quoted dialog, observations and thoughts) were missing from the network and subsequent analysis.",
        "Our work specifically addresses these missed cases, and in that sense our technique for creating social networks is complementary to that of Elson et al. (2010).",
        "Several other researchers have found network theory to be useful in the study of literature.",
        "In his study of Dicken's Bleak House, Sack refines the granularity of interaction types by breaking down links by the purpose of the interaction, differentiating between conversations meant, for example, for legal investigation vs. philanthropy.",
        "Sack (2006) also expands on the definition of ties, including face-to-face interaction as well as what he terms ?weak ties?, which includes interactions like being involved in the same legal suit.",
        "His links are a hybrid of quantitative and qualitative.",
        "Characters are linked by interaction, but how these interactions are then classified are subjective according to Sack (2006).",
        "Thus, they do not follow a strictly defined rubric.",
        "Celikyilmaz et al. (2010) have also worked along a similar track, analyzing networks built based on topical similarity in actor speech.",
        "A theorist who has grappled with the limitations of network analysis is Franco Moretti.",
        "In Network Theory Plot Analysis, Moretti (2011) takes a similar path as Elson et al. (2010), where the act of speech signifies interaction.",
        "Moretti (2011) points out that his close reading of the network extracted from Hamlet is limited by several factors.",
        "First, edges are unweighted, giving equal importance to interactions that are a few words and long, more involved conversations.",
        "Second, edges have no direction, which eliminates who initiated each interaction.",
        "Moretti (2011) concludes that more rigorous network analysis tools are needed in order to make further headway in the field.",
        "In this paper we extract two types networks from Alice in Wonderland, one directed and the other undirected, both of which are weighted.",
        "We show that indeed discriminating between unidirectional and bidirectional linkages gives us insight into the character profiles and their role in the novel.",
        "Overall, the previous work has primarily focused on turning time into space, flattening out the action in order to bring to light something that was obfuscated previously.",
        "However, time and its passage plays a crucial role in literature.",
        "Literature is, after all, built in layers, with successive scenes stacking up on each other.",
        "Texts reveal information not all at once, like a network, but in spurts.",
        "This is not merely an unfortunate side-effect of the medium, but a central element that is manipulated by authors and",
        "is central in extracting ?meaning?",
        "(Perry, 1979).",
        "However, the static social network (SSN) medium itself is not suited to clearly reveal these changes.",
        "Dynamic social networks (DSN), on the other hand, can go beyond the summary statistics of SSN.",
        "Moreover, because of their flattening effect, SSNs can lead to inaccurate or inexact information (Berger-Wolf et al., 2006).",
        "The DSN approach has many applications, from analyzing how terrorist cells evolve over time (Carley, 2003), to mapping the interactions in the writing community (Perry-Smith and Shalley, 2003).",
        "One of the obstacles to using DSNs is that they are not as straightforward to visualize as SSNs.",
        "In this paper, we use a visualization outlined in Moody et al. (2005).",
        "While the visualization may not be novel, to the best of our knowledge, DSNs have not yet been used to observe networks extracted from literary texts.",
        "Our goal is to push beyond the limitations of static network analysis of literature by adding the crucial element it lacks: dynamism."

        "An important aspect of annotating social events is taking into consideration the intention of the author: does the author want us to notice an event between characters or is he/she simply describing a setting of a plot?",

        "Figure 2 presents plots for dynamic network analysis of the different types of networks extracted from Alice in Wonderland.",
        "We look at interaction (INR) and observation (OBS) networks, as we did for the previous section, except we do this for each of the 10 chapters independently of all other chapters.",
        "The social network metrics we consider are: degree, in-degree and out-degree centrality.",
        "Note that for an undirected network (i.e. INR), all three network analysis metrics are the same.",
        "In this section we present insights about the three characters considered in the previous section (Alice, Mouse and Rabbit), that are lost in static network analysis.",
        "From Figure 2, it is clear that Alice (dotted blue line) is not the most central character in every chapter, something that is lost in the static network.",
        "Consider figure 2(a) i.e. degree centrality of INR network.",
        "Alice ranks 2 in chapters 3, 4 (the drying ceremony mentioned above) and 9.",
        "In chapter 9, Alice is overshadowed by The Hatter and Rabbit.",
        "This makes sense, as this chapter concerns Rabbit and The Hatter being witnesses at Alice's trial.",
        "By breaking the story down chapter by chapter like this, it becomes evident that although Alice is a very active character throughout, there are moments, such as the trial, where she is inactive, indeed powerless.",
        "Yet as soon as the trial is over and Alice is back in her own world in chapter 10, we see a spike as she again takes an active role in her fate.",
        "Figure 2(b) shows in-degree centrality for the OBS network.",
        "This represents how often a character is thought about or talked about by another character.",
        "Notice that Alice is completely absent in this network: no one thinks about or mentions her.",
        "This is to be expected, as Alice is our guide through Wonderland.",
        "No one mentions her because she is present in every scene, thus any dialog about her will become an interaction.",
        "Likewise, no one thinks of her because the reader is not presented with other character's thoughts, only Alice?s.",
        "This is consistent with earlier observations made in the static network.",
        "Interestingly, Queen (solid black line) comes to dominate the later chapters, as she becomes the focus of Alice's thoughts and mentions.",
        "Again, this spike in Queen's influence (Figure 2(b)) is lost in the static network.",
        "But it is Queen who ultimately has the power to decide the final punishment for Alice at the end of the trial, so it is fitting that Alice's thoughts are fixated with her.",
        "Figure 2(c) shows the out-degree centrality of the OBS network, a starkly different picture.",
        "Here, we see why Mouse (dashed red line) has such importance in the static network.",
        "Over the course of the drying ceremony in chapter 2 and 3, he mentions a very large number of characters.",
        "The dynamic network allows us to see that while Mouse does play a key role at one point of the story, his influence is largely limited to that one section.",
        "Other characters overshadow him for the rest of the text.",
        "Comparing Mouse's role in the in-degree centrality graph (figure 2(b)) vs. out-degree centrality (figure 2(c)), we can see that much of Mouse's influence comes not from entities referring to him (in-degree), but rather the number of entities he mentions.",
        "His importance",
        "centrality values (Degree, In-degree, Out-degree) in different types of network (INR and OBS).",
        "X-axis has the chapter numbers (one through ten) and Y-axis has the value of the relevant centrality measure.",
        "in the piece, then, appears to be isolated to a key chapter where he acts as a guide to introduce many entities to the reader.",
        "Likewise, tracing Rabbit (dash-dotted green line) across in-and out-degree centrality of the OBS network (figure 2(b) and 2(c)) gives a more fine-grained view of how he works in the text.",
        "He is the most mentioned in chapters 1 and 4, chapters that sandwich a big event, the drying ceremony of chapters 2 and 3.",
        "Likewise, he reemerges for another big event, Alice's trial (chapter 8, 9, 10).",
        "As previously mentioned, Queen is the primary concern in Alice's mind during the length of the trial.",
        "However, Queen is absent from the out-degree graph?she makes no reference to off-screen characters.",
        "Rabbit, who has a large spike in out-degree links during these chapters, is the one who actually mentions a large number of characters, while Queen focuses on interacting with those already present.",
        "Thus, Rabbit is a character that concerns Alice during large set-pieces, one whose primary purpose comes in noticing and being noticed.",
        "We see that using a dynamic network can provide a more subtle view than using a static network.",
        "Characters who are key in certain sections are no longer overshadowed, like Queen, nor are their importance exaggerated, like Mouse.",
        "It can also provide us with a better view of when and how a protagonist is most important throughout the text.",
        "Finally, analyzing across data dimensions can provide a very specific idea of how a character is functioning, as seen with Rabbit."

      "heading": "8 Conclusion",
      "text": [
        "In this paper we have motivated a computational approach to dynamic network analysis.",
        "We have hand-annotated Lewis Carrol's Alice in Wonderland using a strict and well-defined annotation scheme and created social event networks from these annotations.",
        "From these, we have shown the usefulness of using different types of networks to analyze different aspects of a text.",
        "We derive point-of-view from a social network.",
        "We also break down important characters into certain roles that describe how they function in the text.",
        "Ultimately, we find that these roles are limited by the static nature of social networks and create dynamic networks.",
        "From these, we extract a clearer picture of how these roles work, as well as other characters overshadowed in the static network.",
        "Having shown the value of such analysis, future work will focus on adapting our computational model (Agarwal and Rambow, 2010) for extracting social events from a different domain (news articles) to this new domain (literary text).",
        "We will then investigate a large number of literary texts and investigate how we can use our machinery to empirically validate theories about literature."
