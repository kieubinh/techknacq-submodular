        "Language models are used to estimate the probability of a sequence of words.",
        "They are an important module in many areas of natural language processing, in particular large vocabulary speech recognition (LVCSR) and statistical machine translation (SMT).",
        "The goal of LVCSR is to convert a speech signal x into a sequence of words w. This is usually approached with the following fundamental equation:",
        "In SMT, we are faced with a sequence of words e in the source language and we are looking for its best translation f into the target language.",
        "Again, we apply Bayes rule to introduce a language model:",
        "Although we use a language model to evaluate the probability of the produced sequence of words, w and f respectively, we argue that the task of the language model is not exactly the same for both applications.",
        "In LVCSR, the LM must choose among a large number of possible segmentations of the phoneme sequence into words, given the pronunciation lexicon.",
        "It is also the only component that helps to select among homonyms, i.e. words that are pronounced in the same way, but that are written differently and which have usually different meanings (e.g. ate/eight or build/billed).",
        "In SMT, on the other hand, the LM has the responsibility to chose the best translation of a source word given the context.",
        "More importantly, the LM is a key component which has to sort out good and bad word reorderings.",
        "This is known to be a very difficult issue when translating from or into languages like Chinese, Japanese or German.",
        "In LVCSR, the word order is given by the time-synchronous processing of the speech signal.",
        "Finally, the LM helps to deal with gender, number,",
        "etc accordance of morphologically rich languages, when used in an LVCSR as well as an SMT system.",
        "Overall, one can say that the semantic level seems to be more important for language modeling in SMT than LVCSR.",
        "In both applications, so called back-off n-gram language models are the de facto standard since several decades.",
        "They were first introduced in the eighties, followed by intensive research on smoothing methods.",
        "An extensive comparison can be found in (Chen and Goodman, 1999).",
        "Modified-Kneser Ney smoothing seems to be the best performing method and it is this approach that is almost exclusively used today.",
        "Some years ago, there was a clear tendency in SMT to use huge LMs trained on hundreds on billions (1011) of words (Brants et al., 2007).",
        "The authors report continuous improvement of the translation quality with increasing size of the LM training data, but these models require a large cluster to train and to perform inference using distributed storage.",
        "Therefore, several approaches were proposed to limit the storage size of large LMs, for instance (Federico and Cettolo, 2007; Talbot and Osborne, 2007; Heafield, 2011)."

        "The main drawback of back-off n-gram language models is the fact that the probabilities are estimated in a discrete space.",

        "It is important to note that the CSLM is still an n-gram approach, but the notion of backing-off to shorter contexts does not exist any more.",

        "It also has the advantage that the complexity only slightly increases for longer context windows, while it is generally considered to be unfeasible to train back-off LMs on billions of words for orders larger than 5.",
