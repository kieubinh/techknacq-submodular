        "In both these cases, the speech signal is transmitted through a second channel, which means that the user needs two digital boxes.",

        "Other projects have been trying to use OCR (optical character recognition) to interpret the subtitles on the TV or computer screen.",
        "In 2002, a project by the Swedish Association of the Visually Impaired developed a prototype that used OCR to Interpret subtitles, which then were spoken aloud using TTS (Eliasson, 2005, pp.",
        "63?64).",
        "The project estimated that a mass-produced product would cost around 2500C, which they concluded would be too much",
        "for ordinary users.",
        "In 2007, a similar Danish project described a tool that reads the composite video signal, performs OCR on the subtitles and then speaks them using TTS (Nielson and Bothe, 2007).",
        "They also developed a specialised OCR algorithm for subtitle detection (J?nsson and Bothe, 2007).",
        "However, both systems have remained prototypes and have not been released as publicly available tools.",
        "A similar Czech project has investigated how to minimise speech overlap and how to get better synchronisation by using techniques such as time compression and text simplification (Hanzl?c?ek et al., 2008; Matou?ek et al., 2010).",
        "Their evaluation is purely technical, where they count the number of overlapped subtitles and the number of subtitles that require different compression factors, but they have not evaluated their prototype system on actual users.",
        "Finally, there is an ongoing Swedish project by the Swedish dyslexia association ?Dyslexif?rbundet FMLS?",
