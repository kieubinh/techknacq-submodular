        "This paper describes a demonstration of the WinkTalk system, which is a speech synthesis platform using expressive synthetic voices.",
        "With the help of a webcamera and facial expression analysis, the system allows the user to control the expressive features of the synthetic speech for a particular utterance with their facial expressions.",
        "Based on a personalised mapping between three expressive synthetic voices and the users facial expressions, the system selects a voice that matches their face at the moment of sending a message.",
        "The WinkTalk system is an early research prototype that aims to demonstrate that facial expressions can be used as a more intuitive control over expressive speech synthesis than manual selection of voice types, thereby contributing to an improved communication experience for users of speech generating devices."

        "During a human verbal communication process, expressive features of face and speech are congruent, operating in a synchronised manner (Campbell, 2008), (Graf et al., 2002).",
        "Facial expressions and expressive speech styles often help to convey the emotional intent of the speaker that is only partially contained in the words.",
        "The application described in this paper aims to make use of this synchrony and applies facial expressions as a real time volitional control over the expressive features of synthetic utterance productions of augmented speakers.",
        "The WinkTalk system is currently a research prototype in progress, operating on a personal computer equipped with a webcamera.",
        "The goal of the system is to respond to the need of integrated multimodality in speech generating devices of users of augmentative and alternative communication1 (AAC) applications (Higginbotham, 2010).",
        "Being able to correctly link facial expression to synthetic speech output is a step forward to a more intuitive way of controlling the expressiveness of synthetic speech.",
        "The approach can be considered novel, as the authors are not aware of another system using facial expressions to control expressive TTS."

        "The WinkTalk system is a web based application developed using AJAX and PHP technologies.",

        "The internal architecture of the system is shown in figure 1.",
        "The system operates based on a configurable workflow defining the three modes of the system: a personalisation mode, an automatic voice selection mode based on facial expression, which is the core functionality of the system, and a control mode of manual voice selection, that was included for evaluation purposes.",
        "In the manual voice selection application the user is presented with the three options and selects the voice style that 1Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) refers to an area of research, clinical, and educational practice.",
        "AAC involves attempts to study and when necessary compensate for temporary or permanent impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions of individuals with severe disorders of speech-language production and/or comprehension, including spoken and written modes of communication.",
        "(ASHA, 2005)",
        "Talk system matches the emotional or expressive intent of the message.",
        "It has previously been shown that after a short familiarisation with the voices, it is possible for the user to make a fairly good prediction of how a particular utterance will sound when synthesised with one of the voices (Sze?kely et al., 2012).",
        "This makes it possible to use the system in a conversation situation, in which the user does not have the opportunity to listen to the three possible speech samples but needs to make a choice ahead of the time of the synthesis.",
        "The automatic voice choice mode and the personalisation mode will be described in sections 3 and 4, respectively."

        "The initial mapping between facial expression categories and ranges of intensity values and voices are shown in Table 1.",
        "For example, an image analysed as containing the facial expression suprised with an intensity of 25, the system will synthesise the corresponding utterance with the C voice.",
        "The system always uses the facial expression category with the highest value for a particular image.",
        "These initial values have been",
        "chosen based on considerations about arousal levels of the underlying basic emotion of the facial expression categories, for example with surprise being a high arousal emotion, the intensity scores of it result sooner in a higher intensity voice choice.",
        "The values have also been supported by the results a perceptual test carried out by 25 participants on a dataset that was balanced to contain equal amount of stimuli from all facial expression categories.",
        "Participants were asked to select from three synthesised utterances the one best matching the facial expression of a person on a picture.",
        "The perceptual test has shown that 90% of all majority votings (above 66% agreement among participants) fell within the initial threshold values.",
        "When a message is being sent to the synthesiser, the system makes a snapshot of the user's face.",
        "Based on the image scores and threshold table, the system decides which voice best suits the current facial expression and returns the results accordingly.",
        "The system also provides an option to take streaming video input from the camera rather than a single image, and calculate the feature values over an interval of the video around the time of sending a message.",
        "To take into consideration the cases where individual preferences of voice choice differ greatly, as well as to account for individual differences in facial characteristics, a personalisation component has been integrated in the system, which will be introduced in section 4."
