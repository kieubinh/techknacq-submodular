        "In the United States, approximately $100 billion are spent annually on the direct and indirect care of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the majority of which is attributed to long-term institutional care (Ernst et al., 1997).",
        "As the population ages, the incidence of AD will double or triple, with Medicare costs alone reaching $189 billion in the US by 2015 (Bharucha et al., 2009).",
        "Given the growing need to support this population, there is an increasing interest in the design and development of technologies that support this population at home and extend ones quality of life and autonomy (Mihailidis et al., 2008).",
        "?Contact: frank@cs.toronto.edu Alzheimer's disease is a type of progressive neuro-degenerative dementia characterized by marked declines in mental acuity, specifically in cognitive, social, and functional capacity.",
        "A decline in memory (short- and long-term), executive capacity, visual-spacial reasoning, and linguistic ability are all typical effects of AD (Cummings, 2004).",
        "These declines make the completion of activities of daily living (e.g., finances, preparing a meal) difficult and more severe declines often necessitate caregiver assistance.",
        "Caregivers who assist individuals with AD at home are common, but are often the precursor to placement in a long-term care (LTC) facility (Gaugler et al., 2009).",
        "We are building systems that automate, where possible, some of the support activities that currently require family or formal (i.e., employed) caregivers.",
        "Specifically, we are designing an intelligent dialog component that can engage in two-way speech communication with an individual in order to help guide that individual towards the completion of certain daily household tasks, including washing ones hands and brushing ones teeth.",
        "A typical installation setup in a bathroom, shown in figure 1, consists of video cameras that track a user's hands and the area in and around the sink, as well as microphones, speakers, and a screen that can display prompting information.",
        "Similar installations are being tested in other household rooms as part of the COACH project (Mihailidis et al., 2008), according to the task; this is an example of ambient intelligence in which technology embedded in the environment is sensitive to the activities of the user with it (Spanoudakis et al., 2010).",
        "Our goal is to encode in software the kinds of techniques used by caregivers to help their clients achieve these activities; this includes automatically identifying and recovering from breakdowns in communication and flexibly adapting to the individual over time.",
        "Before such a system can be deployed, the underlying models need to be adjusted to the desired population and tasks.",
        "Similarly, the speech output component would need to be programmed according to the vocabularies, grammars, and dialog strategies used by caregivers.",
        "This paper presents preliminary experiments towards dedicated speech recognition for such a system.",

        "Of these, individuals with middle-stage AD exhibited more discourse-related difficulties including inattention, failure to track propositions and thematic information, and deficits in working memory.",
        "The most common repair initiators and repairs given communication breakdown involved frequent ?wh-questions and hypotheses (e.g., ?Do you mean??).",
        "Conversational partners of individuals with middle-stage AD initiated repair less frequently than conversational partners of control subjects, possibly aware of their deteriorating ability, or to avoid possible further confusion.",
