        "Some approaches have concentrated on specific constructions which are especially hard to understand for readers with disabilities (Carroll et al., 1998; Canning et al., 2000), others focused on text simplification as a help for other linguistic tasks such as the simplification of patent texts (Mille and Wanner, 2008; Bouayad-Agha et al., 2009).",
        "Recently the availability of larger parallel or quasi-parallel corpora, most notably the combination of the English and the Simple English Wikipedia, has opened up new possibilities for the use of more purely data-driven approaches.",

        "(2011).",
        "They use standard software from the field of statistical machine translation (SMT) and apply these to the problem of text simplification.",
        "They complement these with a deletion component which was created for the task.",
        "They concentrate on four text simplification operations: deletion, rewording (lexical simplification), reordering and insertions.",
        "Text simplification is explicitly treated in a similar way to sentence compression.",
        "They use standard SMT software, Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) and GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000), and define the problem as translating from English (represented by the English Wikipedia) to Simple English (represented by the Simple English Wikipedia).",
        "The translation process can then imply any of the four mentioned operations.",
        "They compared their approach to various other systems, including a dedicated sentence compression system (Knight and Marcu, 2002) and show that their system outperforms the others when evaluated on automatic metrics which use human created reference text, including BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).",
        "Their problem setting does, however, not include sentence splitting (as we will describe below).",
        "Another potential problem is that the metrics they use for evaluation compare to human references, but they do not necessarily reflect human acceptability or grammaticality.",

(2010) on the same data set, but they have to admit that learning from parallel bi-text is not as efficient as learning from revision histories of the Wiki-pages.",

        "Simplification There are several considerations which lead us to take a hybrid approach to text simplification.",
        "First of all there is a lack of parallel data in the case of Spanish.",
        "Within our project we are preparing a corpus of Spanish news texts (from the domain of national news, international news, society and culture), consisting of 200 news text and their manually simplified versions.",
        "The manual simplification is time consuming and requires work from specially trained experts, so the resulting corpus is not very big, even if the quality is controlled and the type of data is very specific for our needs.",
        "It is also very hard to find large amounts of parallel text from other sources.",
        "In order to use data driven techniques we would require amounts of bi-text comparable to those used for statistical machine translation (SMT) and this makes it nearly impossible to approach the problem from this direction, at least for the time being.",
        "But there are also theoretic considerations which make us believe that a rule based approach is a good starting point for automatic text simplification.",
        "We consider that there are at least four separate NLP tasks which may be combined in a text simplification setting and which may help to reduce the reading difficulty of a text.",
        "They all have a different nature and require different solutions.",
        "?",
        "Lexical simplification: technical terms, foreign words or infrequent lexical items make a text more difficult to understand and the task consists in substituting them with counterparts which are easier to understand.",
        "?",
        "Reduction of syntactic complexity: long sentences, subordinate structure and especially recursive subordination make a text harder to understand.",
        "The task consists in splitting long sentences in a series of shorter ones.",
        "?",
        "Content reduction: redundant information make a text harder to read.",
        "The task consists in identifying linguistic structures which can be deleted without harming the text grammaticality and informativeness in general.",

        "The linear distance between the two instances of this noun is considerable and the sentences in which two alignment targets occur are not even necessarily adjacent.",
        "In addition, there may be multiple occurrences of the same word in the simplified text which are not correct targets; the most apparent case are functional words, but even words which are generally infrequent may be used repeatedly in a small stretch of text if the topic requires it (in this paragraph, for example, the word translation occurs 4 times and the word sentence 5 times).",
        "While a machine can probably learn the one-to-may translations which are needed here, a non-trivial extension of the machine-translation setting is needed and the learning problem needs to be carefully reformulated.",

        "The mobile applications are basically RSS/Atom feed readers, with simplification capabilities (provided by the service layer).",
        "Both applications work the same way and allow to the user functionalities as keeping a list of favourite feeds, adding and removing feeds, marking content as favourite and showing the simplified and original versions of the content.",
        "Also a web service was created, which works in a similar way for RSS and Atom feeds and allows to simplify the text portion of other publicly available websites.",
        "Figure 2 shows a screen capture of the mobile application running in a Android tablet, displaying a simplification example of a text taken from a news website.",
        "The display text of this image is reproduced in Table 4 for better readability.",
        "The text itself is too long for us to provide a translation, but it can be seen that many sentences have been split.",
        "Also a series of minor problems can be seen, which we will resolve in the near future: The first word of a sentence is still in lower case and the head noun of the named entity John Langdon Haydon Down was not correctly identified."

        "Automatic text simplification is an Assistive Technology which help people with cognitive disabilities to gain access to textual information.",
        "In this paper we have presented a syntactic simplification module of a automatic text simplification system which is under development.",
        "We have presented arguments for the decision of using a hybrid strategy which combines a rule-based grammar with a statistical support component, we have described the implementation of this idea and have given a contrastive evaluation of the grammar with and without statistical support.",
        "The simplification system we described here is integrated in a user-oriented service architecture with mobile applications and web services.",
        "In future work we will further enhance the system and integrate new components dedicated to other simplification aspects, such as lexical simplification and content reduction."
