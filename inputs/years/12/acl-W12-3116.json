        "Being a new topic, it still does not have well established baselines, datasets or standard evaluation metrics.",
        "The usual approach is to use a set of features which are used to train a classifier in order to assign a prediction score to each sentence.",
        "In this work, we propose a set of features based on the morphological and syntactic properties of involved languages thus abstracting away from word surface particularities (such as vocabulary and domain).",
        "This approach is shown to be very useful for evaluation task (Popovic?, 2011; Popovic?",
        "et al, 2011; Callison-Burch et al., 2011).",
        "The features investigated in this work are based on the language model (LM) scores and on the IBM1 lexicon scores (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "The inclusion of IBM1 scores in translation systems has shown experimentally to improve translation quality (Och et al., 2003).",
        "They also have been used for confidence estimation for machine translation (Blatz et al., 2003).",

        "To the best of our knowledge, these scores have not yet been used for translation quality estimation.",
        "The LM scores of words and POS tags are used for quality estimation in previous work (Spe-cia et al., 2009), and in our work we investigate the scores calculated on morphemes and POS tags.",
        "At this point, only preliminary experiments have been carried out in order to determine if the proposed features are promising at all.",
