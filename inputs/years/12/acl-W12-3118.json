        "The WMT 2012 Quality Estimation shared-task focused on automatic methods for estimating machine translation output quality at runtime (sentence-level estimation).",
        "Different from MT evaluation metrics, quality prediction (QP) systems do not rely on reference translations and are generally built using machine learning techniques to estimate quality scores (Specia et al., 2009; Soricut and Echihabi, 2010; Bach et al., 2011; Specia, 2011).",
        "Some interesting uses of sentence-level MT quality prediction are the following: decide whether a given translation is good enough for publishing as-is (Soricut and Echihabi, 2010), or inform monolingual (target-language) readers whether or not they can rely on a translation; filter out sentences that are not good enough for post-editing by professional translators (Specia, 2011); select the best translation among options from multiple MT systems (Soricut and Narsale, 2012), etc.",
        "This shared-task focused on estimating the quality of English to Spanish automatic translations.",
        "The training set distributed for the shared task comprised of 1, 832 English sentences taken from the news domain and their Spanish translations.",
        "The translations were produced by the Moses SMT system (Koehn et al., 2007) trained on Europarl data.",
        "Translations also had a quality score derived from an average of three human judgements of Post-Editing effort using a 1 5 scale (1 for worse-quality/most-effort, and 5 for best-quality/least-effort).",
        "Submissions were evaluated using a blind official test set of 422 sentences produced in the same fashion as the training set.",
        "Two subtasks were considered: (i) scoring translations using the 1-5 quality scores (Scoring), and (ii) ranking translations from best to worse (Ranking).",
        "The official metrics used for the Ranking task were DeltaAvg (measuring how valuable a proposed ranking is from the perspective of extrinsic values associated with the test entries, in this case post-editing effort on a 1-5 scale; for instance, a DeltaAvg of 0.5 means that the top-ranked quantiles have +0.5 better quality on average compared to the entire set), as well as the Spearman ranking correlation.",
        "For the Scoring task the metrics were Mean-Absolute-Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).",
        "The interested reader is referred to (Callison-Burch et al., 2012) for detailed descriptions of both the data and the evaluation metrics used in the shared-task.",
