        "Evaluations were performed with different translation quality measures: BLEU, NIST, TER and METEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2011) which evaluate distinct aspects of the quality of the translations.",
        "First we evaluated the WMT11 test (test11) as an internal indicator of our systems.",
        "Later we did the same analysis with the WMT12 official test files.",
        "Table 5 presents the obtained results.",
        "Experiments began building the baseline system, which included the special treatment for clitics, contractions and casing as described in Section 2.2.",
        "Once the baseline was set, we proceeded with two parallel lines, one for morphology simplification and the other for domain adaptation.",
        "For morphology generation approach (Table 5) oracles (Morph.",
        "Oracle) represent how much gain we could expect with a perfect generation module and generation (Morph.",
        "Gen.) represent the actual performance combining simplification and the generation strategies.",
        "Oracles achieve a promising averaged improvement of +1.79% (depending on the metric or the test set) with respect to the baseline.",
        "However, generation only improves the baseline by a +0.61%, encouraging us to keep working on that strategy.",
        "Regarding the domain adaptation approach, we evaluated the internal test set (test11).",
        "As we can see again on Table 5a the adaptation strategy outperforms the baseline on all quality measures starting with an averaged gain of +0.94%.",
        "Comparing the two approaches, we can see that the domain adaptation method was better in terms of BLEU score and TER than the morphology generation but the latter was better on NIST and METEOR on our internal test set.",
        "This made us decided for the latter as the primary system submitted, leaving the domain adaptation approach system as a contrastive submission.",
        "Additionally to the automatic quality measures, we are particularly interested in the manual evaluation results, as we believe the morphology generation will be more sensitive to this type of eval",
        "uation than to automatic metrics.",
        "Official results (test12) can be found on Table 5b.",
        "Surprisingly, this time the domain adaptation approach performed better than the morphology simplification on all metrics: BLEU, NIST, TER and METEOR, with an averaged gain of +1.04% over the baseline system, which ranks our submissions second and third in terms of BLEU scores (contrastive and primary respectively) when compared with all other submissions for the WMT12 translation task.5 Conclusions and further work This papers describes the UPC participation during the 2012 WMT's Translation Task.",
        "We have participated with a baseline system for Spanish-to-English, a baseline system for English-to-Spanish and two independent enhancements to the baseline system for English-to-Spanish as well.",
        "Our primary submission applied morphology simplification and generation with the objective of ease the translation process when dealing with rich morphology languages like Spanish, deferring the morphology generation as an external post-process classification task.",
        "The second approach focused on domain adaptation.",
        "Instead of concatenating the training News parallel data together with the European Parliament and United Nations, a preliminary system was built with the latter two and separated translation and reordering models were computed using the News parallel data.",
        "These models were then added to the preliminary models in order to build the adapted system.",
        "Results showed that both approaches performed better than the baseline system, being the domain adaptation configuration the one that performed better for 2012 test in terms of all automatic quality indicators: BLEU, NIST, TER and METEOR.",
        "We look forward the the manual evaluation results as we believe our primary system may be more sensitive to this type of human evaluation.",
        "Future work should focus on combining the two approaches, applying first morphological generalization to the training data and then using the domain adaptation technique on the resulting corpora in order to determine the joined benefits of both strategies."
