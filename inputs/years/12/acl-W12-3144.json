        "In phrase-based systems the source sentence is segmented by the decoder according to the best combination of phrases that maximize the translation and language model scores.",

        "Although more target side context is available to the language model, source side context would also be valuable for the decoder when searching for the best translation hypothesis.",
        "To make also source language context available we use a bilingual language model, in which each token consists of a target word and all source words it is aligned to.",
        "The bilingual tokens enter the translation process as an additional target factor and the bilingual language model is applied to the additional factor like a normal language model.",
        "For more details see Niehues et al. (2011).",
        "Mauser et al. (2009) have shown that the use of discriminative word lexica (DWL) can improve the translation quality.",
        "For every target word, they trained a maximum entropy model to determine whether this target word should be in the translated sentence or not using one feature per one source word.",
        "When applying DWL in our experiments, we would like to have the same conditions for the training and test case.",
        "For this we would need to change the score of the feature only if a new word is added to the hypothesis.",
        "If a word is added the second time, we do not want to change the feature value.",
        "In order to keep track of this, additional bookkeeping would be required.",
        "Also the other models in our translation system will prevent us from using a word too often.",
        "Therefore, we ignore this problem and can calculate the score for every phrase pair before starting with the translation.",
        "This leads to the following definition of the model:",
        "In this definition, p(ej |f) is calculated using a maximum likelihood classifier.",
        "Each classifier is trained independently on the parallel training data.",

        "We could now use all other sentences as negative examples.",
        "But in many of these sentences, we would anyway not generate the target word, since there is no phrase pair that translates any of the source words into the target word.",
        "Therefore, we build a target vocabulary for every training sentence.",
        "This vocabulary consists of all target side words of phrase pairs matching a source phrase in the source part of the training sentence.",
        "Then we use all sentence pairs where e is in the target vocabulary but not in the target sentences as negative examples.",
        "This has shown to have a postive influence on the translation quality (Mediani et al., 2011) and also reduces training time.",

        "The idea is illustrated in Figure 1.",

        "to the end of the English word in order to perform the same morphological word transformation.",
        "We use only rules where the ending of the word has at most 3 letters.",
        "Depending on the POS, number, gender or case of the involved words, the same operation on the source side does not necessarily correspond to the same operation on the target side.",
        "To account for this ambiguity, we rank the different target operation using the following four features and use the best ranked one.",
        "Firstly, we should not generate target words that do not exist.",
        "Here, we have an advantage that we can use monolingual data to determine whether the word exists.",
        "In addition, a target operation that often coincides with a given source operation should be better than one that is rarely used together with the source operation.",
        "We therefore look at pairs of entries in the lexicon and count in how many of them the source operation can be applied to the source side and the target operation can be applied to the target side.",
        "We then use only operations that occur at least ten times.",
        "Furthermore,",
        "we use the ending of the source and target word to determine which pair of operations should be used.",
        "Integration We only use the proposed method for OOVs and do not try to improve translations of words that the baseline system already covers.",
        "We look for phrase pairs, for which a source operation ops exists that changes one of the source words f1 into the OOV word f2.",
        "Since we need to apply a target operation to one word on the target side of the phrase pair, we only consider phrase pairs where f1 is aligned to one of the target words of the phrase containing e1.",
        "If a target operation exists given f1 and ops, we select the one with the highest rank.",
        "Then we generate a new phrase pair by applying ops to f1 and opt to e1 keeping the original scores from the phrase pairs, since the original and synthesized phrase pair are not directly competing anyway.",
        "We do not add several phrase pairs generated by different operations, since we would then need to add the features used for ranking the operations into the MERT.",
        "This is problematic, since the operations were only used for very few words and therefore a good estimation of the weights is not possible."
