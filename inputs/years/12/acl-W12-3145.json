        "This leads to challenges in estimating LM scores for partial target hypotheses and this is typically addressed by adding a sentence initial marker (<s>) to the beginning of each derivation path.1 Thus the language model scores for the hypothesis in the intermediate cell are approximated, with the true language model score (taking into account sentence boundaries) being computed in the last cell that spans the entire source sentence.",
        "Kriya uses a novel idea for computing LM scores: for each of the target hypothesis fragment, it finds the best position for the fragment in the final sentence and uses the corresponding score.",
