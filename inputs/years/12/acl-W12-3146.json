        "Following the success of our modified parser, we would also like to modify the tagger in a similar way, since incorrect analyses produced by the tagger often hinder the correct function of our rules, sometimes leading to a rule worsening the translation instead of improving it.",
        "As observed e.g. by Groves and Schmidtke (2009) for English-to-German and English-to-French translations, SMT systems for other language pairs also tend to produce reoccurring grammatical errors.",
        "We believe that these could be easily detected and corrected in a rule-based way, using an approach similar to ours."
