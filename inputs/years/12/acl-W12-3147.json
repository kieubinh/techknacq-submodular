        "We only considered the translation between French and English (in both directions).",
        "The main differences with respect to previous year's system (Schwenk et al., 2011) are as follows: (i) use of more training data as provided by the organizers and (ii) better selection of the monolingual and parallel data according to the domain, using the cross-entropy difference with respect to in-domain and out-of-domain language models (Moore and Lewis, 2010).",
        "We kept some previous features: the improvement of the translation model adaptation by unsupervised training, a parallel corpus retrieved by Information Retrieval (IR) techniques and finally, the rescoring with a continuous space target language model for the translation into French.",
        "These different points are described in the rest of the paper, together with a summary of the experimental results showing the impact of each component."

      "text": [
        "Available human translated bitexts such as the Europarl or 109 corpus seem to be out-of domain for this task.",
        "We used two types of automatically extracted resources to adapt our system to the domain.",
        "First, we generated automatic translations of the provided monolingual News corpus in French and English, for years 2009, 2010 and 2011, and selected the sentences with a normalised translation cost (returned by the decoder) inferior to a threshold.",
        "The resulting bitexts contain no new translations, since all words of the translation output come from the translation model, but they contain new combinations (phrases) of known words, and reinforce the probability of some phrase pairs (Schwenk, 2008).",
        "Like last year, we directly used the word-to-word alignments produced by the decoder at the output instead of GIZA's alignments.",
        "This speeds-up the procedure and yields the same results in our experiments.",
        "A detailed comparison is given in (Lambert et al., 2011).",
        "Second, as in last year's evaluation, we automatically extracted and aligned parallel sentences from comparable in-domain corpora.",
        "We used the AFP (Agence France Presse) and APW (Associated Press Worldstream Service) news texts since there are available in the French and English LDC Gigaword corpora.",
        "The general architecture of our parallel sentence extraction system is described in detail by Abdul-Rauf and Schwenk (2009).",
        "We first translated 91M words from French into English using our first stage SMT system.",
        "These English sentences were then used to search for translations in the English AFP and APW texts of the Gigaword corpus using information retrieval techniques.",
        "The Lemur toolkit (Ogilvie and Callan, 2001) was used for this purpose.",
        "Search was limited to a window of ?5 days of the date of the French news text.",
        "The retrieved candidate sentences were then filtered using the Translation Error Rate (TER) with respect to the automatic translations.",
        "In this study, sentences with a TER below 75% were kept.",
        "Sentences containing a large fraction of numbers were discarded.",
        "By these means, about 27M words of additional bitexts were obtained."

      "heading": "2.4 Domain-based Data selection",
      "text": [
        "Before training the target language models, a text selection has been made using the cross-entropy difference method (Moore and Lewis, 2010).",
        "This technique works by computing the difference between two cross-entropy values.",
        "We first score an out-of-domain corpus against a language model trained on a set of in-domain data and compute the cross-entropy for each sentence.",
        "Then, we score the same out-of-domain corpus against a language model trained on a random sample of itself, with a size roughly equal to the in-domain corpus.",
        "From this point, the difference between in-domain cross-entropy and out-of-domain cross-entropy is computed for each sentence, and these sentences are sorted regarding this score.",
        "By estimating and minimizing on a development set the perplexity of several percentages of the sorted out-of-domain corpus, we can then estimate the theoretical best point of data size for this specific corpus.",
        "According the original paper and given our results, this leads to better selection than the simple perplexity sorting (Gao et al., 2002).",
        "This way, we can be assured to discard the vast majority of noise in the corpora and to select data well-related to the task.",
        "In this task, the French and English target language models were trained on data selected from all provided monolingual corpora.",
        "In addition, LDC's Gigaword collection was used for both languages.",
        "Data corresponding to the development and test periods were removed from the Gigaword collections.",
        "We had time to apply the domain-based data selection only for French.",
        "Thus all data were used for English.",
        "We used this method to filter the French?English 109 parallel corpus as well, based on the difference between in-domain cross-entropy and out-of-domain cross-entropy calculated for each sentence of the English side of the corpus.",
        "We kept 49 million words (in the English side) to train our models, called 109f .",
        "3 Architecture of the SMT system The goal of statistical machine translation (SMT) is to produce a target sentence e from a source sentence f .",
        "We have build phrase-based systems (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2003), using the standard log linear framework in order to introduce several models explaining the translation process:",
        "The feature functions hi are the system models and the ?i weights are typically optimized to maximize a scoring function on a development set (Och, 2003).",
        "The phrase-based system uses fourteen features functions, namely phrase and lexical translation probabilities in both directions, seven features for the lexicalized distortion model, a word and a phrase penalty and a target language model (LM).",
        "The system is based on the Moses SMT toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007) and is constructed as follows.",
        "First, word alignments in both directions are calculated.",
        "We used a multi-threaded version of the GIZA++ tool (Gao and Vogel, 2008).1 This speeds up the process and corrects an error of GIZA++ that can appear with rare words.",
        "Phrases and lexical reorderings are extracted using the default settings of the Moses toolkit.",
        "The parameters of Moses were tuned using the MERT tool.",
        "We repeated the training process three times, each with a different seed value for the optimisation algorithm.",
        "In this way we have a rough idea of the error introduced by the tuning process.",
        "4-gram back-off LMs were used.",
        "The word list contains all the words of the bitext used to train the translation model and all words that appear at least ten times in the monolingual corpora.",
        "Words of the monolingual corpora containing special characters or sequences of uppercase characters were not included in the word list.",
        "Separate LMs were build on each data source with the SRI LM toolkit (Stol-cke, 2002) and then linearly interpolated, optimizing the coefficients with an EM procedure.",
        "The perplexities of these LMs on newstest2011 were 119.1 for French and 174.8 for English.",
        "In addition, we build a 5-gram continuous space language model for French (Schwenk, 2007).",
        "These models were trained on all the available texts using a resampling technique.",
        "The continuous space language model is interpolated with the 4-gram back-off model and used to rescore n-best lists.",
        "This reduces the perplexity by about 13% relative."

        "In the same way, the English integer 32,000 is translated in French by 32 000.",

        "On the other hand, adding the bitexts extracted from the comparable corpus (IR) does actually hurt the performance of the French?English system: the BLEU score decreases from 28.95 to 28.67 on our internal test set.",
        "During the evaluation period, we added all the corpora at once and we observed this only in our analysis after the evaluation.",
        "In both translation directions our best system was the one trained on Eparl+NC+ntsXX+109f+News+IR.",
