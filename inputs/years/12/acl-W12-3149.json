        "In spite of its shortcomings (Callison-Burch et al., 2006), it has been considered the standard automatic measure in the development of SMT systems (with new measures being added to it, but not substituting it, see for e.g. (Cer et al., 2010)).",
        "Of course, the main problem of using the BLEU score as a feature for sentence selection in a real-life scenario is that we do not have the references available.",
        "We overcame this issue by generating a custom set of references for each system, using the other systems as gold translations.",
        "This is of course inexact, but n-grams that appear on the output of different systems can be expected to be more probable to be correct, and BLEU calculated this way gives us a measure of this agreement.",
        "This approach can be considered related to n-gram posteriors (Zens and Ney, 2006) or minimum Bayes risk decoding (e.g. (Ehling et al., 2007)) in the context of n-best rescoring, but applied without prior weighting (unavailable directly) and more focused on the evaluation interpretation.",
        "We generated two features based on this idea.",
        "The first one is computed at the system level, i.e. it is the same for each sentence produced by a system and serves as a kind of prior weight similar to the one used in other system combination methods (e.g. (Matusov et al., 2008)).",
        "The other feature was computed at the sentence level.",
        "For this we used the smoothed version of BLEU proposed in (Lin and Och, 2004), again using the output of the rest of the systems as pseudo-reference.",

        "For this year's evaluation DFKI used a statistical system based around the Jane machine translation toolkit (Vilar et al., 2010a), working in its two modalities: phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based models.",
        "Different enhancements were tried in addition to the baseline configuration: POS-based verb reordering, monolingual data selection, poor man's syntax and lightly supervised training, with mixed results.",
        "A sentence selection mechanism has later been applied in order to combine the output of the different configurations.",
        "Although encouraging results had been obtained in (Vilar et al., 2011), for this task we found only a small improvement.",
        "This may be due to the strong similarity of the systems, as they are basically trained on the same data.",
        "In (Vilar et al., 2011) the training data was varied across the systems, which may have produced a bigger variety in",
        "the translation outputs that can be of advantage for the selection mechanism.",
        "This is an issue that should be explored in more detail for further work.",
        "We also plan to do a comparison with system combination approaches where new hypotheses can be generated (instead of selecting one from a predefined set), and study under which conditions each approach is more suited than the other."
