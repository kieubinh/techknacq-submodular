        "While Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) models translation at the sentence level (Brown et al., 1993), human translators work on larger translation units.",
        "This is partly motivated by the importance of producing consistent translations at the document level.",
        "Consistency checking is part of the quality assurance process, and complying with the terminology requirements of each task or client is crucial.",
        "In fact, many automatic tools have been proposed to assist humans in this important task (Itagaki et al., 2007; Dagan and Church, 1994, among others).",
        "This suggests that wider document-level context information might benefit SMT models.",
        "However, we do not have a clear picture of the impact of sentence-based SMT on the translation of full documents.",
        "From a quality standpoint, it seems safe to assume that translation consistency is as desirable for SMT as for human translations.",
        "However, consistency needs to be balanced with other quality requirements.",
        "For instance, strict consistency might result in awkward repetitions that make translations less fluent.",
        "From a translation modeling standpoint, while typical SMT systems do not explicitly enforce translation consistency, they can learn lexical choice preferences from training data in the right domain.",
        "In this paper, we attempt to get a better understanding of SMT consistency.",
        "We conduct an empirical analysis using a phrase-based SMT system in a variety of experimental settings, focusing on two simple, yet understudied, questions.",
        "Is SMT output consistent at the document level?",
        "Do inconsistencies indicate translation errors?",
        "We will see that SMT consistency issues are quite different from consistency issues in human translations.",
        "In fact, while inconsistency errors in SMT output might be particularly obvious to the human eye, SMT is globally about as consistent as human translations.",
        "Furthermore, high translation consistency does not guarantee quality: weaker SMT systems trained on less data translate more consistently than stronger larger systems.",
        "Yet, inconsistent translations often indicate translation errors, possibly because words and phrases that translate inconsistently are the hardest to translate.",
        "After discussing related work on consistency and document modeling for SMT (Section 2), we describe our corpora in Section 3 and our general methodology in Section 4.",
        "In Section 5, we discuss the results of an automatic analysis of translation consistency, before turning to manual analysis in Section 6."

        "Moreover, this approach blurs the line between consistency and domain modeling.",
        "In fact, Gong et al. (2011) reports statistically significant improvements in BLEU only when combining pure consistency caches with topic and similarity caches, which do not enforce consistency but essentially perform domain or topic adaptation.",

        "All these results suggest that consistency can be a useful learning bias to improve overall translation quality, as measured by BLEU score.",
