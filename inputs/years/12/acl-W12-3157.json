        "The application of statistical machine translation (SMT) to word lattice input was first introduced for the translation of speech recognition output.",
        "Rather than translating the single-best transcription, the speech recognition system encodes all possible transcriptions and their probabilities within a word lattice, which is then used as input for the machine translation system (Ney, 1999; Matusov et al., 2005; Bertoldi et al., 2007).",
        "Since then, several groups have adapted this approach to model ambiguities in representing the source language with lattices and were able to report improvements over their respective baselines.",
        "The probabilities for different paths through the lattice are usually modeled by assigning probabilities to arcs as a byproduct of the lattice generation or by defining binary indicator features.",
        "Applying the first method only makes sense if the lattice construction is based on a single, comprehensive probabilistic method, like a Chinese word segmentation model as is used by Xu et al. (2005).",
        "In applications like the one described by Dyer et al. (2008), where several different segmenters for Chinese are combined to create the lattice, this is not possible.",
        "Also, our intuition suggests that simply defining indicator features for each of the segmenters may not be ideal, if we assume that there is not a single best segmenter, but rather that for different data instances a different one works best.",
        "In this paper, we propose to model the lattice path implicitly within the phrase translation model.",
        "We introduce a novel lattice design, which explicitly distinguishes between different ways of preprocessing the source sentence.",
        "It enables us to define specific binary features for each preprocessing type and to learn lexicalized lattice path probabilities and the phrase translation model simultaneously with a forced alignment training procedure.",
        "To train the phrase translation model, most state-of-the-art SMT systems rely on heuristic phrase extraction from a word-aligned training corpus.",
        "Using a modified version of the translation decoder to",
        "force-align the training data provides a more consistent way of training.",
        "Wuebker et al. (2010) introduce a leave-one-out method which can overcome the over-fitting effects inherent to this training procedure (DeNero et al., 2006).",
        "The authors report this to yield both a significantly smaller phrase table and higher translation quality than the heuristic phrase extraction.",
        "We argue that applying forced alignment training helps to exploit the full potential of word lattice translation.",
        "The effects of the training on lattice input are analyzed on the news-commentary portion of the German?English WMT 2011 task.",
        "Our results show moderate improvements of up to 0.6% BLEU over the baseline.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: We will review related work in Section 2, describe the decoder in Section 3 and present our novel lattice design in Section 4.",
        "The phrase training algorithm is introduced in Section 5, and Section 6 gives a detailed account of the experimental setup and discusses the results.",

        "For a direct comparison between the heuristic and phrase-trained full lattice systems, we manually inspected the optimized log-linear parameter values for the layer features.",
        "We observe that for the standard lattices, paths through the lemmatized layer are heavily penalized.",
        "In the phrase trained lattice setup, the penalty is much smaller.",
        "As a result, the number of words from the Lemma layer used for translation of the newstest2009 data set is increased by 49% from 1828 to 2715 words.",
        "However, a manual inspection of the translations reveals that the main improvement seems to come from a better choice of phrases from the Compound layer.",
        "More specifically, the used phrases tend to be shorter ?",
        "the average phrase length of Compound layer phrases is 1.5 words for both the baseline and the heuristic lattice system.",
        "In the phrase trained lattice system, it is 1.3 words.",
        "An example is given in Figure 2.",
        "We focus on the end of the sentence, where the heuristic system uses the rather disfluent phrase (ist unverst?ndlich.",
        "# can't understand it.",
        "), whereas the forced alignment trained system applies the three phrases (ist # is), (unverst?ndlich # incomprehensible) and (.",
        "# .).",
        "This effect can be explained by the leave-one-out procedure.",
        "As lemmatized phrases usually map to several phrases in the other layers, their count is generally higher.",
        "Application of leave-one-out, which reduces the counts of all phrases extracted from the current sentence by a fixed value, therefore has a stronger penalizing effect on Surface and Compound layer phrases.",
        "In the extreme case, phrases which are singletons in the Compound layer are unlikely to be used at all in training, if the corresponding phrase in the Lemma layer has a higher count.",
        "While this rarely leads to the competing lemmatized phrases being used in free translation, it allows for shorter, more general phrases from the more expressive layers to be applied.",
