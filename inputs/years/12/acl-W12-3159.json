        "Minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) is a common method for optimizing linear model parameters, which is an important part of building good machine translation systems.",
        "MERT minimizes an arbitrary loss function, usually an evaluation metric such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) or TER (Snover et al., 2006) from a surrogate representation of the search space, such as the N best candidate translations of a development set.",
        "Much of the recent work ?",
        "This research was conducted during the author's intern-ship at Microsoft Research.",
        "on minimum error rate training focused on improving the method by Och (2003).",
        "Recent efforts extended MERT to work on lattices (Macherey et al., 2008) and hypergraphs (Kumar et al., 2009).",
        "Random restarts and random walks (Moore and Quirk, 2008) are commonly used to combat the fact the search space is highly non-convex, often with multiple minima.",
        "Several problems still remain with MERT, three of which are addressed by this work.",
        "First, the N - best error surface explored by MERT is generally not the same as the true error surface, which means that the error rate at an optimum1 of the N best error surface is not guaranteed to be any close to an optimum of the true error surface.",
        "Second, most SMT decoders make search errors, yet MERT ignores the fact that the error surface of an error-prone decoder differs from the one of an exact decoder (Chang and Collins, 2011).",
        "MERT calculates an envelope from candidate translations and assumes all translations on the envelope are reachable by the decoder, but these translations may become unreachable due to search errors.",
        "Third, MERT is only used to tune linear model parameters, yet SMT systems have many free decoder parameters?such as distortion limit and beam size?that are not handled by MERT.",
        "MERT does not provide a principled way to set these parameters.",
        "In order to overcome these issues, we explore the application of direct search methods (Wright, 1995) to SMT.",
        "To do this, we integrate the decoder and the evaluation metric inside the objective function,",
        "globally optimal.",
        "An alternative that optimizes N best lists exactly is presented by Galley and Quirk (2011), and we do not discuss it further here.",
        "which takes source sentences and a set of weights as inputs, and outputs the evaluation score (e.g., BLEU score) computed on the decoded sentences.",
        "Since it is impractical to calculate derivatives of this function, we use derivative-free optimization methods such as the downhill simplex method (Nelder and Mead, 1965) and Powell's method (Powell, 1964), which generally handle such difficult search conditions relatively well.",
        "This approach confers several benefits over MERT.",
        "First, the function being optimized is the true error rate.",
        "Second, integrating the decoder inside the objective function forces the optimizer to account for possible search errors.",
        "Third, contrary to MERT, our approach does not require input parameters to be those of a linear model, so our approach can tune a broader range of features, including non-linear and hidden-state parameters (e.g., distortion limit, beam size, and weight vector applied to future cost estimates).",
        "In this paper, we make direct search reasonably fast thanks to two speedup techniques.",
        "First, we use a model selection acceleration technique called racing (Moore and Lee, 1994) in conjunction with randomization tests (Riezler and Maxwell, 2005) to avoid decoding the entire development set at each function evaluation.",
        "This approach discards the current model whenever performance on the translated subset of the development data is deemed significantly worse in comparison to the current best model.",
        "Second, we store and reuse search graphs across function evaluations, which eliminates some of the redundancy of regenerating the same translations in different optimization steps.",
        "Our experiments with a strong phrase-based translation system show that the direct search approach is an effective alternative to MERT.",
        "The speed of direct search is generally comparable to MERT, and translation accuracy is generally superior.",
        "The non-linear and hidden-state features tuned in this work bring gains on three language pairs, with improvements ranging between 0.27 and 0.35 BLEU points."

        "The successive expansion of translation options in order to construct the search graph is generally done from scratch, but this can be wasteful when the same sentences are translated multiple times, as it is the case with direct search.",
        "Even when the parameters of the decoder change across function evaluations, some partial translation are likely to be constructed multiple times, and this is more likely to happen when changes in parameters are relatively small.",
        "To overcome this inefficiency, we memoize hypotheses expansions made in all function evaluations, which then allows us to reuse some edges (or hyperedges) from previous iterations to construct the current graph (or hypergraph).",
        "Since feature values?including expensive features like language model score?are stored into each edge, the speedup is roughly proportional to the percentage of edges we can reuse.",
        "A more radical way of exploiting search graphs of previous iterations is to use them as constraints in a forced decoding approach.",

        "The optimization steps in lattice MERT bypass the decoder, but the lattice-based approach presented here does not.",
        "The distinction is important when it comes to tuning non-linear and hidden state parameters of the decoder.",
        "For instance, the initial lattice may have been constructed with a distortion limit of 4, while the current model specifies a distortion limit of 2.",
        "At that stage, optimization via lattice-constrained decoding instead of lattice-based MERT ensures that we will never select a path of the input lattice that corresponds to a distortion limit of more than 2.",
        "This is important since the error rate must reflect the fact that jumps of two or more words are not allowed.",
        "Figure 4 shows how direct search with lattice-constrained decoding is structured.",
        "Similarly to MERT and as opposed to straight direct search, optimization is repeated multiple times.",
        "Since each optimization in the lattice-constrained case does not require recomputing any features, it usually turns into very significant gains in terms of translation speed, though it also causes a small loss of translation accuracy in general.",

        "That is, the first iteration of MERT uses 20 starting points, the second uses 21 points, etc.",
        "Since MERT is not able to directly optimize search parameters such as distortion limit and beam size, our baseline system uses grid search to optimize them.",
        "To make this search more tractable, we only perform the grid search for a single parameter: the distortion limit.",

        "A linear model that is effective with a distortion limit of 4 can be suboptimal for a limit of 8. using one reference translation, and ignoring case.",
        "Row 1 displays results of the MERT baseline, with a distortion limit that was found optimal using a grid search on the development set.",
        "Rows 2 and 3 show results of direct error rate minimization with downhill simplex and Powell's method, where direct search optimizes both linear model parameters and the distortion limit.",
        "We see here that the performance of direct search is comparable and sometimes better than MERT, but the benefit of direct search here is that it does not require an external grid search to find an effective distortion limit (each direct search is initialized with a distortion limit of 10).",
        "Row 4 shows the performance of Powell's method using the extended parameter set (Section 4), which includes model weights for future costs and polynomial features.",
        "We lack space to present an extensive analysis of the relative impact of the different non-linear features and parameters discussed in this paper, but we generally find that the following parameters work best: distortion limit, polynomial distortion penalty, and weight of future cost estimate of the language model.",
        "The fact that Moses-style future cost estimation for language models often overestimates probably explains why the latter feature helps.",
        "In the last row of Table 2, optimization is done using the time-sensitive variant of BLEU presented in Section 4.4, and the set of parameters tuned here includes all the previous ones, in addition to beam size, and the two parameters controlling histogram and threshold pruning in beam search.",
        "Clearly, running direct search to directly optimize BLEU would yield a very large beam size and would set pruning parameters that are so permissive that they would almost completely disable pruning.",
        "The benefit of using the time-sensitive variant of BLEU is that direct",
        "search is forced to find parameter weights that offer a good balance between accuracy and speed.",
        "To make our results in row 6 as comparable as possible to row 4, we use the running time (on the development set) of row 4 as a time constraint for the model of row 6, which is to decode the entire development set at least as fast.",
        "In other words, the system of row 6 is optimized to be no slower than the system of row 4, and is otherwise penalized due to the time penalty.",
        "The effect of this is that translation speed at tuning time is almost the same, and speed of systems 4 and 6 is roughly the same at test time.",
        "A comparison between rows 4 and 6 suggests that tuning search parameters such as beam size and without affecting time does not provide much gain in terms of translation quality, but the method nevertheless has one advantage: one can target a specific translation speed without having to manually tune any parameter such as beam size, and without even having to decide which parameter to manually tune.",
        "Times to run optimizations end-to-end are reported in parentheses in Table 2 and they take into account the time to run the grid search in the case of MERT.",
        "Times to decode test sets are not reported here since they are roughly the same across all models.",
        "While translation accuracy with MERT and direct search is roughly the same when the underlying parameter set is the same, direct search wins in running time when it comes to optimizing search parameters like distortion limit.",
        "Since each grid search runs MERT eight times, MERT is generally faster than direct search, but the difference of speed remains reasonable if the number of tuned parameters is the same, and direct search is rarely twice as slow.",
        "We finally discuss the case of lattice-constrained decoding, which is shown in row 5 of Table 2.",
        "This method is not applicable when tuning parameters that affect search thoroughness (row 6), such as beam size.",
        "The reason is that lattice-constrained decoding is a form of forced decoding that considerably narrows the search space.",
        "Under a constrained decoding setting, it appears that a large beam size seldom affects translation speed, but this is misleading and largely due to constraints created by the lattice.",
        "We thus evaluate the lattice-constrained case without tuning ?search?",
