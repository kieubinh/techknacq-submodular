        "One particular direction in computational history has been the use of topic models (Blei et al., 2003) to analyze the rise and fall of research topics to study the progress of science, both in general (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004) and more specifically in the ACL Anthology (Hall et al., 2008).",

        "One goal is to investigate the use of these techniques for computational history in general.",
        "A second goal is to use the ACL Anthology Network Corpus (Radev et al., 2009) and the incorporated ACL Anthology Reference Corpus (Bird et al., 2008) to answer specific questions about the history of computational linguistics.",

        "What have been the pivotal turning points?",
        "Our method consists of four steps.",
        "We first run topic models over the corpus to classify papers into topics and identify the topics that people author in.",
        "We then use these topics to identify epochs by correlating over time the number of persons that topics share in common.",
