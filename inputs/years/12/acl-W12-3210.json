        "In addition, the vision was formulated that manually corrected ground-truth subsets could be compiled.",
        "This is accomplished so far for citation links from paper to paper inside the Anthology for a controlled subset.",
        "The focus thus was laid on bibliographic and bibliomet-ric research and resulted in the ACL Anthology Network (Radev et al., 2009) as a public, manually corrected citation database.",
        "What is currently missing is an easy-to-process XML variant that contains high-quality running text and logical markup from the layout, such as section headings, captions, footnotes, italics etc.",
        "In principle this could be derived from LATEX source files, but unfortunately, these are not available, and furthermore a considerable amount of papers have been typeset with various other word processing software.",
        "Here is where the ACL 2012 Contributed Task starts: The idea is to combine OCR and PDFBox-like born-digital text extraction methods and reassign font and logical structure information as part of a rich XML format.",
