        "The main challenges of this task come from the nature of user queries, which are usually very short and ambiguous.",
        "Since queries contain only several to a dozen words, a QC system often requires either a rather large training set or an enrichment of queries with other information (Shen et al., 2006a), (Broder et al., 2007).",

        "In (Le et al., 2011), it has been shown that click-through information and topic models are useful for query enrichment when the ultimate goal is query classification.",
        "We will follow this enrichment step, but integrate this information into a SVM classifier instead of using matching and ranking between queries and categories as in (Le et al., 2011).",
        "The purpose of this paper is to determine (1) whether the query enrichment with click-though information and hidden topics is useful for a machine learning query classification system using SVM; and (2) whether integrating this enriched information into a machine learning classifier can perform better than the matching and ranking system.",
