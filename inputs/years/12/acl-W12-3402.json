        "Ever since the introduction of wordnets (Miller and Fellbaum, 1991) or more generally machine-readable dictionaries containing semantic relations, researchers have investigated ways to learn such examples automatically from large text corpora, or generalize them from existing instances.",
        "Substantial research exists on the learning of hyperonymy relations (Hearst, 1992; Snow et al., 2005; Tjong Kim Sang and Hofmann, 2009), meronymy relations (Hearst, 1998; Berland and Charniak, 1999; Girju et al., 2003) and selectional preferences (Erk et al., 2010; Bergsma et al., 2008; O?",
        "Se?aghdha, 2010).",
        "Both lexicographic research (Chaffin and Her-rmann, 1987; Morris and Hirst, 2004) and research in cognitive psychology (Vigliocco et al., 2004; McRae et al., 2005), argue that it is important to consider relations beyond the classical inventory of hyperonymy and meronymy relations; furthermore psychological research on priming (Hare et al., 2009) suggests different processing for different relations, which would entail that cognitively plausible modeling of human language should model these relations explicitly rather than simply recording untyped associations between concepts (as in the ?evocation?",
        "relation proposed for WordNet by Boyd-Graber et al., 2006).",
        "One set of suggestions for an extended inventory of relations can be found in the telic and agentive qualia relations of Pustejovsky (1991) which have been shown to be useful in recognizing discourse relations (Wellner et al., 2006), or metonymy/coercion phenomena (Verspoor, 1997; Ru?d and Zarcone, 2011), and have the property of linking different parts-of-speech groups, unlike meronymy and hyperonymy/troponymy.",
        "The work we present in this paper consists of a dataset of noun-verb associations for German concrete nouns, which we present in more detail in section 3, and a state-of-the-art approach to the supervised classification of such cross-part-of-speech relations using informative features from large collections of unannotated text, which we present in section 4.",

        "Some of the more recent work starts out from matches extracted by means of such a pattern, but use supervised training data to learn semantic constraints that improve the precision by filtering the extracted examples.",
        "Berland and Charniak (1999) use some handcrafted rules to exclude abstract objects from the part-of relations they extract from a corpus, and additionally rank pattern extractions by collocation strength.",
        "Girju et al. (2003) propose an iterative refinement scheme based on taxonomic information from WordNet: In this learning approach, general constraints using top-level semantic classes (entity, abstraction, causal-agent) are passed to a decision tree learner and iteratively refined until the semantic constraints induced from the classes are no longer ambiguous.",
        "Katrenko and Adriaans (2008b, 2010) present approaches to learn semantic constraints for the use in recognizing semantic relations between word tokens (SemEval 2007 shared task, see Girju et al., 2009), either in a graph-based generalization of Girju's iterative refinement approach that is able to handle sense ambiguities more gracefully, or by clustering pairs of words by the joint similarity of both relation arguments.",
        "A complementary aspect is to improving recall beyond the possibilities of a few hand-selected patterns.",
        "Following Hearst (1998), Girju et al. (2003) show that it is possible to find usable patterns by exploiting known positive examples and looking for co-occurrences of these relation arguments in a corpus.",
        "However, these patterns usually have low precision and/or very limited recall, meaning that a more elaborate approach (such as Girju et al's induction of semantic constraints) is needed to make the best use of them.",
        "Yamada and Baldwin (2004) propose to use a combination of templates typical of telic and agentive qualia relations (X is worth Y ing, X deserves Y ing, a well-Y ed X) and a statistical ranking combining association and a classifier learned on positive and negative examples for that role.",
        "They find that the combination of association statistic and classification worked somewhat better than the templates alone.",
        "One approach targeted at exploiting a greater number of patterns for hyperonymy relations can be found in the work of Snow et al. (2005): they extract patterns consisting of the shortest path in the dependency graph plus an optional satellite and use the set of all found paths as features in a linear classifier.",
        "The resulting classifier for hyperonymy relations outperforms single patterns both in terms of precision and in terms of recall; a further improvement can be achieved if the frequency of pattern instances is binned instead of just occurrence or non-occurrence being recorded.",
        "Tjong Kim Sang and Hofmann (2009) investigate the question whether it is necessary to use syntactic (rather than surface) patterns for the hyperonym classification approach of Snow et al. They compare a method of extracting features based on syntax as in Snow et al's approach with a surface-based alternative where the string between two words, plus optionally one word to the left or right side of the word, is extracted.",
        "Tjong Kim Sang and Hofmann argue that the benefit of the parser (additional recall due to the better generalization capability of the syntactic patterns) is mostly negated by parsing errors: In some informative contexts that the system based on POS patterns is able to find without problems, parsing errors lead to a parse tree that does not exhibit the intended (dependency path) pattern.",
        "Several researchers have applied such pattern classification approaches to a larger set of relations, and have demonstrated that extracting a pattern distribution between occurrences and performing supervised classification based on this distribution is a promising solution for semantic relations that go beyond hyperonymy.",

        "Using standard machine learning tools (a support vector machine with radial base function kernel), he is able to reach results that are close to those possible with previous more specialized approaches.",
        "Similarly, Herdag?delen and Baroni (2009) tackle a variety of problems in semantic relation classification using a unified approach where frequent uni-grams and bigrams are extracted from co-occurrence contexts of the target word pair (in addition to features extracted from general occurrence contexts of each word).",

        "Versley (2007) uses Web pattern queries for finding hyperonymy relations and mentions the fact that greater morphological richness and the smaller size of the German Web make the use of Web queries more complex than for English.",

        "It is a well-known fact in distributional semantics that raw observation counts for context items (be they elements surrounding single word occurrences or elements extracted from the occurences of two words together) are incomparable for different target words/target pairs (since their frequency can differ) as well as for different context items.",
        "As a result, researchers have proposed different approaches to produce transformed vectors using more sophisticated association statistics (see Dumais, 1991, Weeds et al., 2004, Turney and Pantel, 2010, inter alia).",
        "In our case, we implemented L1 normalization (which normalizes for target word frequency), a conservative estimate for pointwise mutual information (which normalizes for the frequencies of both target word and feature), and the G2 log-likelihood measure of Dunning (1993), which gives significance scores (i.e., numbers that invariably grow both with target and feature frequency, even if the association strength ?",
        "the relation between actual occurrences and those that would be expected when assuming no association ?",
        "is constant).",
        "In both cases, very frequent features would be emphasized in comparison to medium-and low-frequency features.",
        "In the realm of supervised learning, an additional choice has to be made among learning methods that can classify words or word pairs using large feature vectors ?",
        "most commonly using nearest-neighbour classification (Nakov and Kozareva, 2011), using custom kernels in support vector classification (O?",
        "Se?aghdha and Copestake, 2009; Turney, 2008), or by using appropriate techniques to represent the feature vectors in linear classification.",
        "In comparison to the former methods, linear classification scales better with the number of examples (where nearest-neigbour and kernel-based techniques both show strongly superlinear behaviour) and would be the method of choice for large-scale classification.",
        "Herdag?delen and Baroni (2009) propose to map the values computed by association statistics by computing mean and standard deviation of each feature and mapping the range [?",
        "?2?, ?+2?]",
        "of association scores for that feature (seen over the values of that feature for all target pairs) to the range [0, 1] in the input for the classifier, clamping values outside that range to 0 or 1, respectively.",
        "Unfortunately, the approach proposed by Herdag?delen and Baroni has the property that an association score of 0 is mapped to a non-zero feature value for the classifier, which means that feature vectors are no longer sparse (i.e., instead of only storing non-zero values for context items that are informative, values for all context items have to be processed).",
        "To keep the sparsity of the transformed counts, we always use 0 as the lower bound of the mapping (such that zero values stay zero values).",
        "In addition to the Herdagdelen and Baroni's mean/variancebased threshold, we investigated the following possibilities for fixing the upper bound: ?",
        "MI scale: use a constant upper bound of 1 on (a conservative estimate of) the pointwise mutual",
        "factor introduced by Pantel and Lin (2002).",
        "The pointwise mutual information value normalizes the frequency of both words of a pair, hence all mutual information values are on a common scale.",
        "A threshold of 1 in this case corresponds to two items oc",
        "acc unless noted otherwise) ?",
        "norm: use a value based on mean and standard deviation of the occurring values for one given feature (?+ 2?).",
        "?",
        "quant: use a fixed quantile (99%) of all values for a feature for the upper bound of the mapping interval.",
        "In addition, to mapping feature values onto the unit interval [0, 1], we investigated the usefulness of making the features binary-valued by mapping all values lower than the threshold to zero.",
        "While intuitively a continuous-valued feature should be more informative, the high dimensionality of the feature space may mean that noisy feature extraction ultimately leads to a worse model in the continuous-feature case."

        "Because of the skewed distribution, it is useful to look not only at the overall accuracy (Acc) but also at the macro-average of the F-measure of all relations (MacroF).",

        "As is evident from table 1, the accuracy baseline for the most frequent label (telic-artifact) is already quite high.",
        "Looking at results with various scaling methods and learners on single features (table 1), we found that the SVMacc learner consistently yields better accuracy and macro-averaged F-measure than the other two learners.",

        "(For space reasons, table 1 shows numbers only for the w12 feature and L1-norm scaling; other features and settings show a similar relation between the scores for different learners).",
        "As in the investigation by O?",
        "Se?aghdha and Copestake (2007), dependency triples from the path between the two target words are the most effective feature representation and yields both the greatest accuracy value (with L1 scaling and quantile-based setting of thresholds) and the greatest F-measure macroaverage (with G2 scaling and setting of thresholds based on average and standard deviation).",
        "Combination of the triples feature with",
        "other features based on paired co-occurrences does not lead to further improvements, especially with those features that also express information from the dependency path (rel,relsat).",
        "In comparison, the accuracy of the GermaNet hy-pernyms feature (which includes combinations of the hypernyms of first and second word) is much higher than the versions that do not make use of hand-crafted taxonomic knowledge, which is surprising since it uses only taxonomic and no relational information.",
        "The pairwise feature combination for GermaNet features yields another small improvement over these already very good results.",
        "Distributional information on single words, both the strictly window-based w1+w2 feature and the one that is based on more elaborated distributional modeling (attr1+pl2) show quite good results that show further (but relatively small) improvements when combined with the triples feature.",
        "The importance of taxonomic (or, alternatively, distributional semantic) information for the task proposed here - namely, the supervised classification of qualia-like relations - partly mirrors results for the supervised classification of relations between nominals, where O?",
        "Se?aghdha and Copestake (2007) find that their best system for distributional similarity based on the BNC performs at about the same level as a (somewhat simpler) approach using WordNet-based classification (O?",
        "Se?aghdha, 2007), with only much more sophisticated approaches such as the one of O?",
        "Se?aghdha and Copestake (2009), which also makes use of a considerably larger textual basis to improve results over the level of the WordNet-based approach.",
        "Another reason for the importance of taxonomic information in this task may lie in the fact that the different relations have relatively strong selectional restrictions (for animate objects, roles/professions, body parts, or artifacts on the noun side, and certain types of actions or events on the verb side).",
        "Looking at the results for each relation in table 3, we see that both telic-artifact and behaviour-animate, the two relations with the largest counts, are classified quite reliably, while behaviour-bodypart and behaviour-environment, the two relations with very few examples, are never found by the system.",
        "Among the other relations, taxonomical information for nouns and verbs seems to be instrumental for adequate classification of the grooming relation and possibly also for location, telic-bodypart and telic-role."
