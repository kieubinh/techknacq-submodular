        "Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is a major task in Natural Language Processing which provides a shallow semantic parsing of a text.",
        "Its primary goal is to identify and label the semantic relations that hold between predicates (typically verbs), and their associated arguments (Ma`rquez et al., 2008).",
        "The extensive research carried out in this area resulted in a variety of annotated resources, which, in time, opened up new possibilities for supervised SRL systems.",
        "Although such systems show very good performance, they require large amounts of annotated data in order to be successful.",
        "This annotated data is not always available, very expensive to create and often domain specific (Pradhan et al., 2008).",
        "There is in particular no such data available for French.",
        "To bypass this shortcoming, ?annotation-by-projection?",
        "approaches have been proposed (Padó and Lapata, 2006) which in essence, (i) project the semantic annotations available in one language (usually English), to text in another language (in this case French); and (ii) use the resulting annotations to train a semantic role labeller.",
        "Thus Padó and Pitel (2007) show that the projection-based annotation framework permits bootstrapping a semantic role labeller for FrameNet which reaches an F-measure of 63%; and van der Plas et al. (2011) show that training a joint syntactic-semantic parser based on the projection approach permits reaching an F-measure for the labeled attachment score on PropBank annotation of 65%.",
        "Although they minimize the manual effort involved, these approaches still require both an annotated source corpus and an aligned target corpus.",
        "Moreover, they assume a specific role labeling (e.g., PropBank, FrameNet or VerbNet roles) and are not generally portable from one framework to another.",
        "These drawbacks with supervised approaches motivated the need for unsupervised methods capable of exploiting large amounts of unannotated data.",
        "In this context several approaches have been proposed.",
        "Swier and Stevenson (2004) were the first to introduce unsupervised SRL in an approach that used the VerbNet lexicon to guide unsupervised learning.",
        "Grenager and Manning (2006) proposed a directed graphical model for role induction that exploits linguistic priors for syntactic and semantic inference.",
        "Following this work, Lang and Lapata (2010) formulated role induction as the problem of detecting alternations and mapping non-standard linkings to cannonical ones, and later as a graph partitioning problem in (Lang and Lapata, 2011b).",
        "They also proposed an algorithm that uses successive splits and merges of semantic roles clusters in order to improve",
        "their quality in (Lang and Lapata, 2011a).",
        "Finally, Titov and Klementiev (2012), introduce two new Bayesian models that treat unsupervised role induction as the clustering of syntactic argument signatures, with clusters corresponding to semantic roles, and achieve the best state-of-the-art results.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised approach to semantic role labeling that differs from previous work in that it integrates the notion of verb classes into the model (by analogy with VerbNet, we call these verb classes, frames).",
        "We show that this approach gives good results both on the English PropBank and on a French corpus annotated with VerbNet style semantic roles.",
        "For the English PropBank, although the model is more suitable for a framework that uses a shared set of role labels such as VerbNet, we obtain results comparable to the state-of-the-art.",
        "For French, the model is shown to outperform a strong baseline by a wide margin."

        "Following common practice (Lang and Lapata, 2011a; Titov and Klementiev, 2012), we assume oracle argument identification and focus on argument labeling.",
        "The approach we propose is an unsupervised generative Bayesian model that clusters arguments into classes each of which can be associated with a semantic role.",
        "The model starts by generating a frame assignment to each verb instance where a frame is a clustering of verbs and associated roles.",
        "Then, for each observed verb argument, a semantic role is drawn conditioned on the frame.",

        "The model admits a simple Gibbs algorithm where the number of latent variables is proportional to the number of roles and frames to be clustered.",
        "There are two key benefits of this model architecture.",
        "First, it directly encodes linguistic intuitions about semantic frames: the model structure reflects the subcategorisation property of the frame variable, which also groups verbs that share the same set of semantic roles, something very close to the VerbNet notion of frames.",

        "need for a large amount of data and we better share evidence across roles.",
