        "The participants gestured mostly when something happened out of order, e.g. the wheelchair drove to a wrong place or stopped too far from the participant.",
        "Particularly in the bathroom, the wheelchair could not drive very close to the washbasin (predefined destination) and thus many participants gestured so that the wheelchair moves closer.",
        "Two exceptions on gestural types and frequency were the following: in one case a male participant used often iconic gestures ?for fun?, e.g. representing that he holds a gun.",
        "Another participant (female) gestured constantly using pointing gestures during all activities that she carried out.",
        "These cases can be attributed to personal influences, e.g. the user's personality (see Rehm et al., 2008).",
        "The gestures are annotated with the tool ANVIL (Kipp et al. 2007), a free video annotation tool that offers multi-layered annotation.",
        "The gesture annotation conventions for gesture, form, space, and trajectory, which are based on the practice of N. Furuyama (see McNeill, 2005: 273-278), are followed.",
        "As far as co-reference is concerned, in all 317 commands there were several instances that the participants employed in their utterances.",
        "Yet, all of them were either references to the participant him/herself or to the wheelchair: i) ?Rolland, drehe dich bitte um?",
        "(Rolland, turn around please) ii) ?Fahr mich bitte zum Badezimmer?",
        "(Drive me to the bathroom please) For those cases, the participants did not use gestures.",
        "We assume that the rare use of co-reference in our user study is due to the fact that participants almost never had to refer to the same entity again.",
        "Once a command was uttered, the WoZ executed the required action and the participants could move further to the next task they had in their agendas.",
        "Thus, once an entity (i.e. the sofa, the bathroom, the kitchen) has been introduced, the participants never needed to refer back to that same entity again.",
        "Last but not least, nobody of the participants realized that the experiment was WoZ, believing that the wheelchair moved based on their own commands."

      "heading": "6 Conclusion and Future Work Our lab is equipped with intelligent adaptable household appliances and furniture for compensating for special limitations; this lab can be used as an experiment area for many user studies with different purposes. In the presented user study we collected empirical speech and gesture data of natural dialogue in HRI. By making the speech-gesture interaction between users and robot more natural, intuitive, effective, efficient, and user-friendly, assistive environments will become more appropriate in the real world used by seniors and/or seniors to be, people actively planning their future. A planned second user study handles selection and control of objects in a smart environment. In this study objects such as television, lights, electronic sliding doors, etc. will be remotely controlled by the experimenter (WoZ). The participants will be requested to select objects and control their position and level (higher, louder, etc.). A condition tested here will be the presence/lack of ambiguity. Participants will be asked to ?open a door? or ?turn on a light? having many doors and lights available in the lab. In addition, the wheelchair will be intentionally driven by an experimenter to a wrong destination or stopped on its way to a destination point. This adjustment has been made considering the results in the conducted study that participants gestured more when something went wrong. A third study is planned in order to identify which spatial gestures are universal and which are locale-dependent. Within the field of localization, locale is a combination of language and culture. The criteria of locale selection are countries with i) big geographic distance, ii) strong cultural differences, iii) diversity of gestures based on literature evidence, and iv) typologically different languages. This study is necessary to investigate the differences in speech-gesture interaction between the German and other locales. Last but not least, a small scale follow-up study with elderly people will take place in a nursing home. There the elderly could be requested to perform gestures that have already been collected in our previous studies in order to evaluate them depending on their skills and preferences. The collected data from the user studies stored in a corpus will be examined based on the speech",
