        "The amount of older people in today's societies constantly grows due to demographic changes (European Commision Staff, 2007).",
        "Technical systems become more and more common to support for routine tasks of care givers or to assist older persons living alone in their home environments (Alliance, 2009).",
        "Various technical assistive systems have been developed recently (Lisetti et al., 2003), ranging from reminder systems (Boll et al., 2010; Goetze et al., 2010) to assisting robots (Chew et al., 2010; Goetze et al., 2012).",
        "If robot systems are supposed to navigate autonomously they usually rely on vision sensors (Aragon-Camarasa et al., 2010) or acoustic sensors (Youssef et al., ).",
        "Acoustic signals are usually picked up by microphones mounted on the robot.",
        "In real-world scenarios not only the desired signal part is picked up by these microphones as presented in Figure 1.",
        "The desired signal part is usually superposed with disturbing noise originating from the environment or the robot system itself.",
        "This disturbance has to be removed from the microphone signal before it can be further processed, e.g. for navigation, position estimation, acoustic event detection, speaker detection or automatic speech recognition.",
        "This contribution focuses on acoustic input for a robot system and more specifically on the noise reduction preprocessing which is needed to clean up noisy sound signals.",
        "Automatic speech recognition (Huang et al., 2001; W?lfel et al., 2009) is a convenient way to interact with robot assistants since speech is the most natural form of communication.",
        "However, to ensure acceptance of speech recognition systems a suf",
        "ficiently high recognition rate has to be achieved (Pfister and T., 2008).",
        "Today's speech recognition systems succeed in achieving this recognition rate for environments with low amount of noise and reverberation.",
        "Unfortunately, while moving, robots can produce noise degrading the reliability of the ASR.",
        "This work focuses on a specific application, suppressing the non stationary noise produced by the ultrasonic sensors of a robotic assistant while moving.",
        "Please note that although in theory ultrasonic sensors do not produce sound disturbances in the audible range, artefacts due to the fast activation and deactivation of the sensors are present in the audible range and are clearly perceivable as a disturbance in the picked up microphone signal as shown later in",
        "sors (Metralabs, 2010).",
        "Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an approach introduced by Lee & Seung (Lee and Seung, 2001) in which the data is described as the product of a set of basis and of a set of activation coefficients both being non-negative.",
        "We will apply the NMF approach to remove the disturbances caused by the ultrasonic sensors from the microphone input signal in the following.",
        "NMF and its various extensions have been proven efficient in sources separation (Cichocki et al., ; Virtanen, 2007), supervised detection of acoustic events (Cotton and Ellis, 2011) or to wind noise reduction (Schmidt et al., ).",
        "As the NMF algorithm can be fed with prior information about the content to identify, it is a handy way to suppress the non stationary noise produced by the sensors of the considered robotic assistant.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: The general NMF algorithm is presented in Section 2 and the proposed denoising method is described in Section 3.",
        "An experiment using the TIMIT (Zue et al., 1990) speech corpus is presented in Section 4 and finally the performances are evaluated in terms of achieved signal enhancement in Section 5 before Section 6 concludes the paper."
