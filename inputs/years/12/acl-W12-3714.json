        "We first perform a study in emotion blog corpora to discover that there has been no large scale emotion corpus available for the Japanese language.",
        "We choose the largest blog corpus for the language and annotate it with the use of two systems for affect analysis: ML-Ask for word-and sentence-level affect analysis and CAO for detailed analysis of emoticons.",
        "The annotated information includes affective features like sentence subjectivity (emotive/non-emotive) or emotion classes (joy, sadness, etc.",
        "), useful in affect analysis.",
        "The annotations are also generalized on a 2-dimensional model of affect to obtain information on sentence valence/polarity (positive/negative) useful in sentiment analysis.",
        "The annotations are evaluated in several ways.",
        "Firstly, on a test set of a thousand sentences extracted randomly and evaluated by over forty respondents.",
        "Secondly, the statistics of annotations are compared to other existing emotion blog corpora.",
        "Finally, the corpus is applied in several tasks, such as generation of emotion object ontology or retrieval of emotional and moral consequences of actions."

        "There is a lack of large corpora for Japanese applicable in sentiment and affect analysis.",
        "Although there are large corpora of newspaper articles, like Mainichi Shinbun Corpus1, or corpora of classic literature, like Aozora Bunko2, they are usually unsuitable for research on emotions since spontaneous",
        "emotive expressions either appear rarely in these kinds of texts (newspapers), or the vocabulary is not up to date (classic literature).",
        "Although there exist speech corpora, such as Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese3, which could become suitable for this kind of research, due to the difficulties with compilation of such corpora they are relatively small.",
        "In research such as the one by Abbasi and Chen (2007) it was proved that public Internet services, such as forums or blogs, are a good material for affect analysis because of their richness in evaluative and emotive information.",
        "One kind of these services are blogs, open diaries in which people encapsulate their own experiences, opinions and feelings to be read and commented by other people.",
        "Recently blogs have come into the focus of opinion mining or sentiment and affect analysis (Aman and Szpakow-icz, 2007; Quan and Ren, 2010).",
        "Therefore creating a large blog-based emotion corpus could help overcome both problems: the lack in quantity of corpora and their applicability in sentiment and affect analysis.",
        "There have been only a few small Japanese emotion corpora developed so far (Hashimoto et al., 2011).",
        "On the other hand, although there exist large Web-based corpora (Erjavec et al., 2008; Baroni and Ueyama, 2006), access to them is usually allowed only from the Web interface, which makes additional annotations with affective information difficult.",
        "In this paper we present the first attempt to automatically annotate affect on YACIS, a large scale corpus of Japanese blogs.",
        "To do that we use two systems for affect analysis of Japanese, one for word-and sentence-level affect analysis and another especially for detailed analysis of emoticons, to annotate on the corpus different kinds of affective information (emotive expressions, emotion classes, etc.",
        ").",
        "The outline of the paper is as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the related research in emotion corpora.",

        "Unfortunately, most of such research ends in proposing and evaluating a system.",
        "The real world application that would be desirable, such as annotating affective information on linguistic data is limited to processing a usually small test sample in the evaluation.",

        "The comparison is summarized in Table 1.",

        "Eighty one students were employed to write blogs about different topics especially for the need of this research.",

        "They did not include any grammatical information, but focused on affect-related annotations.",
        "As an interesting remark, they were some of the first to recognize the task of distinguishing between emotive and non-emotive sentences.",

        "There was no correlation between YACIS and Nakamura (?=0.25), which confirms the results calculated in previous paragraph.",

        "Finally, a strong correlation was observed between Minato et al. and Nakamura (?=0.88), which is the most interesting observation.",
        "Both Minato et al. and Nakamura are in fact dictionaries of emotive expressions.",
        "However, the dictionaries were collected in different times (difference of about 20 years), by people with different background (lexicographer vs. language teacher), based on different data (literature vs. conversation) assumptions and goals (creating a lexicon vs. Japanese language teaching).",
        "The only similarity is in the methodology.",
        "In both cases the dictionary authors collected expressions considered to be emotion-related.",
        "The fact that they correlate so strongly suggests that for the compared emotion classes there could be a tendency in language to create more expressions to describe some emotions rather than the others (dislike, joy and fondness are often some of the most frequent emotion classes).",
        "This phenomenon needs to be verified more thoroughly in the future."
