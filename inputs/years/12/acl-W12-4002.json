        "In this context, there is hope for building resources via communities of voluntary contributors.",
        "But is it possible to use the Wikipedia paradigm for building a rich and broad-coverage lexical resource reusable by humans and machines in NLP projects?",
        "Wordnets are very interesting resources, but they suffer of several limitations.",
        "First, even if the English wordnet (Miller et al., 1990) is open source and freely available, this is not the case of the EuroWordnets.",
        "Second, wordnets and other manually built thesauri are based on linguists?",
        "intuition.",
        "Information about up-to-date entities (Facebook, Costa Concordia, etc.)",
        "and real-world facts are missing.",
        "Third, relations between the synsets of wordnets are of limited semantic kinds.",
        "We would like to build other relations at the syntactic and lexical level (e.g. collocations).",
        "Our first goal is to build a rich lexical network for the Portuguese language.",
        "The relations between nodes (words) is represented in a sophisticated way, by using lexical-semantical functions ?",

        "The resulting network represents the usage of the language, not the norm.",
        "Thus, it may contain frequent spelling mistakes or neologisms.",
        "This resource is open-source and freely available.",
        "It can be used in several applications: lexicography, printed dictionary, text generation, semantic information extraction, ontology learning, etc.",
        "The construction of the resource is done indirectly by contributors through a game.",

        "The first version was launched for French in 2007 (Lafourcade and Joubert, 2008), which has now around 250,000 nodes and 1,330,000 relations.",
        "Our game aims at building a rich and evolving lexical network comparable to the famous English wordnet (Miller et al., 1990).",
        "The principle is as follows: a player A initiates a game, an instruction is displayed concerning a type of competency corresponding to a lexical relation (e.g. synonym, antonym, domain, intensifier) and a word W is chosen randomly in the database.",
        "Player A has then a limited amount of time for giving propositions that answer the instruction applied to the word W .",

        "For the word W , the common answers of A and B players are entered into the database.",
        "This process participates in the construction of a lexical network linking terms with typed and weighted relations, validated by pairs of players.",

        "As these include a large number of rare words, pilot tests showed that the game became annoying when the player ignored the meaning of most of the proposed words.",
        "Therefore, the number of Google hits for every word was obtained and only the 20% most common ones were kept, resulting in a list of 13,413 words.",
        "To this, the entries of the Brazilian Open Mind Common Sense network (Anacleto et al., 2008) were added, in order to allow future comparison with this resource.",

        "Games were launched in other languages, but due to social factors (lack of community animator), they are in a sleeping state.4 Internally, each word is represented as a node in a graph.",

        "Some players bought competences in hypo-and hypernym, which together account for 15.39% of the edges.",

        "The average degree of a node is 0.955, as more than 750 nodes have only one relation and around 200 have 2 relations, and the degree decreases exponentially.",
        "The trend is that, as more relations are added, the current small components will be attached to the larger ones, but also more smaller unconnected graphs will be created.",

        "We found out that 35.87% of the nodes are covered by the Portuguese wordnet.",
