        "Considering the number of times that a message is retweeted across Twitter is a straightforward way to estimate how interesting it is.",
        "However, a considerable number of messages in Twitter with high retweet counts are actually mundane posts by celebrities that are of interest to themselves and possibly their followers.",
        "In this paper, we leverage retweets as implicit relationships between Twitter users and messages and address the problem of automatically finding messages in Twitter that may be of potential interest to a wide audience by using link analysis methods that look at more than just the sheer number of retweets.",

        "Twitter (http://twitter.com) is a popular social networking and microblogging service that enables its users to share their status updates, news, observations, and findings in real-time by posting text-based messages of up to 140 characters, called tweets.",
        "The service rapidly gained worldwide popularity as a communication tool, with millions of users generating millions of tweets per day.",
        "Although many of those tweets contain valuable information that is of interest to many people, many others are mundane tweets, such as ?Thanks guys for the birthday wishes!!?",
        "that are of interest only to the authors and users who subscribed to their tweets, known as followers.",
        "Finding tweets that are of potential interest to a wide audience from large volume of tweets being accumulated in real-time is a crucial but challenging task.",
        "One straightforward way is to rely on the numbers of times each tweet has been propagated or retweeted by readers of the tweet.",
        "Hong et al. (2011) propose to regard retweet count as a measure of popularity and present classifiers for predicting whether and how often new tweets will be retweeted in the future.",
        "However, mundane tweets by highly popular users, such as celebrities with huge numbers of followers, can record high retweet counts.",
        "Alonso et al. (2010) use crowdsourcing to categorize a set of tweets as ?only interesting to author and friends?",
        "and ?possibly interesting to others?",
        "and report that the presence of a URL link is a single, highly effective feature for distinguishing interesting tweets with more than 80% accuracy.",
        "This simple rule, however, may incorrectly recognize many interesting tweets as not interesting, simply because they do not contain links.",
        "Lauw et al. (2010) suggest several features for identifying interesting tweets but do not experimentally validate them.",
        "In this study, we follow the definition of interesting tweets provided by Alonso et al. (2010) and focus on automatic methods for finding tweets that may be of potential interest to not only the authors and their followers but a wider audience.",
        "Since retweets are intended to spread tweets to new audiences, they are often a recommendation or, according to Boyd et al. (2010), productive communication tool.",
        "Thus, we model Twitter as a graph con",
        "sisting of user and tweet nodes implicitly connected by retweet links, each of which is formed when one user retweets what another user tweeted.",
        "We present a variant of the popular HITS algorithm (Kleinberg, 1999) that exploits the retweet link structure as an indicator of how interesting an individual tweet is.",
        "Specifically, we draw attention on the fact that not all retweets are meaningful.",
        "Some users retweet a message, not because of its content, but only because they were asked to, or because they regard retweet-ing as an act of friendship, loyalty, or homage towards the person who originally tweeted (Boyd et al., 2010).",
        "The algorithm proposed in this paper is designed upon the premise that not all retweet links are created equal, assuming that some retweets may carry more importance or weight than others.",
        "Welch et al. (2011) and Romero et al. (2011) similarly extend link analysis to Twitter, but address essentially different problems.",
        "We conduct experiments on real world tweet data and demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than the simple retweet count approach and a similar recent work on Twitter messages (Castillo et al., 2011) that uses supervised learning with a broad spectrum of features."

        "We treat the problem of finding interesting tweets as a ranking problem where the goal is to derive a scoring function which gives higher scores to interesting tweets than to uninteresting ones in a given set of tweets.",
        "To derive the scoring function, we adopt a variant of HITS, a popular link analysis method that emphasizes mutual reinforcement between authority and hub nodes (Kleinberg, 1999).",
        "Formally, we model the Twitter structure as directed graph G = (N,E) with nodes N and directional edges E. We consider both users U = {u1, .",

        ".",
        ".",
        ", tnt} as nodes and the retweet relations between these nodes as directional edges.",
        "For instance, if tweet ta, created by user ua, retweets tb, written by user ub, we create a retweet edge eta,tb from ta to tb and another retweet edge eua,ub from ua to ub."

        "we first run it on the user subgraph and let tweets inherit the scores from their publishers.",

        "Two annotators were instructed to categorize each tweet as interesting or not, by inspecting its content as done in the work of Alonso et al. (2010).",

        "The second baseline, #URL+#RT, favors tweets that contain URL links (Alonso et al., 2010).",
        "Since it is less likely for a tweet to contain more than one link, we additionally use #RT to break ties in tweet ranking.",

        "Since authoritative users can post ordinary status updates occasionally in Twitter, we cannot always expect them to create interesting content every time they tweet.",
