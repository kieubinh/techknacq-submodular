        "Over the years, researchers have successfully shown how to build ground facts (Etzioni et al., 2005), semantic lexicons (Thelen and Riloff, 2002), encyclopedic knowledge (Suchanek et al., 2007), and concept lists (Katz et al., 2003).",
        "Among the most well developed repositories are those focusing on is-a (Hearst, 1992) and part-of (Girju et al., 2003; Pennacchiotti and Pantel, 2006) relations.",
        "However, to be able to answer the question ?What causes tumors to shrink?",
        "?, one requires knowledge about cause-effect relation.",
        "Other applications that can benefit from cause-effect knowledge are the relational search engines which have to retrieve all terms relevant to a query like: ?find all X such that X causes wrinkles?",
        "(Ca-farella et al., 2006).",
        "Unfortunately to date, there is no universal repository of cause-effect relations that can be used or consulted.",
        "However, one would still like to dispose of an automated procedure that can accurately and quickly acquire the terms expressing this relation.",
        "Multiple algorithms have been created to learn relations.",
        "Some like TextRunner (Etzioni et al., 2005) rely on labeled data, which is used to train a sequence-labeling graphical model (CRF) and then the system uses the model to extract terms and relations from unlabeled texts.",
        "Although very accurate, such methods require labeled data which is difficult, expensive and time consuming to create.",
        "Other more simplistic methods that rely on lexico-syntactic patterns (Hearst, 1992; Riloff and Jones, 1999; Pa≈üca, 2004) have shown to be equally successful at learning relations, temporal verb order (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) and entailment (Zanzotto et al., 2006).",
        "Therefore, in this paper, we have incorporated an automated bootstrapping procedure, which given a pattern representing the relation of interest can quickly and easily learn the terms associated with the relation.",
        "In our case, the pattern captures the cause-effect relation.",
        "After extraction, we apply graph-based metrics to rerank the information and filter out the erroneous terms.",
