        "Because of the no vocabulary restrictions, there are different kinds of tags, such as tags like keywords, category names or even named entities.",
        "However, we can",
        "still find the inner relationship between the tags and the resource that they describe.",
        "Figure 1 shows a snapshot of a social tagging example, where the famous artist, Michael Jackson was annotated with multiple social tags by users in Last.fm2.",
        "Actually,",
        "We can easily find out that social tags concisely indicate the main content of the given online resource and some of them even reflect user interests.",

        "For the sake of easing the process of user annotation and providing a better effect of human-computer interaction, researchers expected to build",

        "Thus some of them proposed to automatically suggest tags based on resource summaries, which are collectively known as the content-based approach (F. Ricci et al., 2011).",
        "The basic idea of content-based approach in recommender systems is to select important words from summaries as tags.",
        "However, this is far from adequate as not all tags are statistically significant in the summaries.",
        "Some of them even do not appear in the corresponding summaries.",
        "For example, in Figure 1, the popular tag dance does not appear in the summary, but why most of users choose it as a proper tag to describe Michael Jackson.",
        "This ?out-of-summary?",
        "phenomenon reflects a fact that users usually exploit their own knowledge and associative ability to annotate online resources.",
        "When a summary comes, they associate the important words in the summary with other semantic-related tags based on their knowledge.",
        "To improve the automatic tag recommendation, a social computing issue (Wang et al., 2007), modeling the social tagging behavior is the straightforward way.",
        "Namely, how to analyze the human tagging process and propose a suitable approach that can help the computer to simulate the process are what we will explore in this paper.",
