        "They tried to transform the source language while the approach proposed here attempts transformations on both source and target laguage sides.",
        "Recent related works use statistical measures like Mutual Information and Log Likelihood Ratio (Seretan and Wehrli, 2007) to know the degree of cohesion between constituents of a MWE.",
        "These require defining threshold value above which the extracted phrase is qualified as a MWE.",
        "Minkov et al. (2007) utilized the rich syntactic and morphological analyzers to generate the inflections.",
        "Hindi lacks availability of robust parsers and complex morphological analyzers.",

        "For identification of the verbal constructs, the POS information is utilized with simple combining rules to make verb phrases.",
        "This yields better alignment of verbal phrases and results in more grammatical, fluent and acceptable translations.",
