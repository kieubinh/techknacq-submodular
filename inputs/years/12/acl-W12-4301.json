        "The Create a Research Space (CARS) model includes counter-claiming and establishing a gap during the ?establishing a niche?",
        "phase (Swales, 1990), and the Rhetorical Structure Theory includes a contrast schema and antithesis relation that is used between different nucleus and satellite clauses (Mann & Thompson, 1988).",
        "However, neither of these models identify where scientists make these comparisons.",
        "In contrast, Kircz's (1991) study of physics articles only mentions comparisons with respect to the use of data to compare with other experimental results (sections 4.3 and 8.1, respectively) with earlier work.",
        "Similarly, Teufel and Moen's contrast category (which includes the action lexicon s better_solution, comparison and contrast) is also restricted to contrasts with other work (Teufel & Moens, 2002).",
        "Lastly the Claim Framework (CF) includes a comparison category, but in contrast to the earlier comparisons that reflect how science is situated within earlier work, the CF captures comparisons between entities (Blake, 2010).",
        "Identifying comparisons automatically is difficult from a computational perspective (Friedman, 1989).",
        "For example, the following sentence is not a comparison even though it contains two words (more than) which are indicative of comparisons.",
        "More than five methods were used.",

        "(Bresnan, 1973), p275.",
        "Perhaps due to this complexity, several instructional books have been written to teach such constructs to non-native speakers.",
        "Our goal in this paper is to automatically identify comparison claims from full-text scientific articles, which were first defined in Blake's Claim Framework (Blake, 2010).",
        "Comparisons capture a binary relationship between two concepts within a sentence and the aspect on which the comparison is made.",
        "For example, ?patients with AML?",
        "(a type of",
        "leukemia) and ?normal controls?",

        "In this paper, we focus on identifying comparison sentences and leave extraction of the two concepts and the aspect on which the comparison is made as future work.",
        "Similar to earlier comparison sentences in biomedicine, we consider the sentence as the unit of analysis (Fiszman, et al. 2007).",
        "To achieve this goal, we cast the problem as a classification activity and defined both semantic and syntactic features that are indicative of comparisons based on comparison sentences that were kindly provided by Fiszman (2007) and Blake (2010).",
        "With the features in place, we conducted experiments using the Na?ve Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers, which both work well on text.",
        "We then introduce a Bayesian Network (BN) that removes some of the independence assumptions made in NB model.",
        "The subsequent evaluation considers more than 1,735 comparison claim sentences that were identified in 122 full text toxicology articles.",
        "Although automatically detecting comparison sentences in full-text articles is challenging, we believe that the information conveyed from such sentences will provide a powerful new way to organize scientific findings.",
        "For example, a student or researcher could enter a concept of interest and the system would provide all the comparisons that had been made.",
        "Such a system would advance our general knowledge of information organization by revealing what concepts can be compared.",

        "Comparison sentences play a critical role in scientific discourse as they enable an author to fully engage the reader by relating work to earlier research hypotheses, data collection methods, subject groups, and findings.",
        "A review scientific discourse models reveals that comparisons have been reported as the thesis/antithesis in CARS (Swales, 1990), the contrast category in RST (Mann & Thompson, 1988) in Teufel & Moens (2002) and as a comparisons category in CF (Blake, 2010).",
        "In this paper, we introduce 35 features that capture both semantic and syntactic characteristics of a sentence.",
        "We then use those features with three different classifiers, Na?ve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Bayesian Networks to predict comparison sentences.",
        "Experiments consider 122 full text documents and 14,157 sentences, of which 1,735 express at least one comparison.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the largest experiment on comparison sentences expressed in full-text scientific articles.",
        "Results show that the accuracy and F1 scores of the BN were statistically (p<=0.05) higher than those of both the NB and SVM classifiers.",
        "Results also suggest that scientists report claims using a comparison sentence in 12.24% of the full-text sentences, which is consistent with, but more prevalent than in an earlier Claim Framework study which reported a rate of 5.11%.",
        "Further work is required to understand the source of this variation and the degree to which the comparison features and classifiers used in this paper can also be used to capture comparisons of scientific papers in other domains."
