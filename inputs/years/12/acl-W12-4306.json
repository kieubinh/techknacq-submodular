        "(?we?, ?our results?, or similar).",
        "Closer analysis of the papers that mention this shows that in all cases where personal pronouns are mentioned as a hedging device, epistemic verbs are present, in phrases such as: ?we show?, ?our results suggest?, etc.",
        "Therefore, simply mentioning personal pronouns does not add a useful feature; it does lead to a great deal of false positives, since (first-)personal pronouns are often used in describing methods (?next, we injected?, etc.)",
        "Pander Maat, 2009), leading to a total of 812 clauses.",
        "For each clause, we identified the epistemic/knowledge attribution value/source/basis according to the taxonomy in Table 1.",
        "Next, we identified the incidence of the four cue types under investigation: modal auxiliary verbs, qualifying adverbs/adjectives, reporting verbs (clauses containing a reporting verb and subordinate clauses controlled by matrix clause with a reporting verb), and references.",
        "A sample of this markup, with the clause, attribution/evaluation type, and presence or absence of markers, is given in Table A1.",
        "This sample is too small to draw any quantitative conclusions from.",
        "However, we do believe our results support the validity of our model, in two ways: first, because we easily can identify a modality type (value/source/basis) for each of the 812 clauses, and second, because all statements of value < 3 are indicated by one of the four cue types which we have identified.",
        "Next to these general findings, a few correlations between cue type and epistemic evaluation type become apparent (for details, see Table A2): ?",

        "16 of these (36%) did have a reporting verb (the reporting verbs used here were analyze, address, assess, define, determine, identify, investigate, localize, and test).",
        "12 of these cases were indeed goal clauses containing a to-infinitive verb form.",
        "These results suggest that a combination of verb tense/aspect as well as semantic verb class should be taken into account when analyzing cues for epistemic modality.",

      "heading": "5 Conclusion and implementations In summary, we have presented a taxonomy of knowledge assessment and attribution and a set of linguistic cues based on a literature overview of from various fields. A small corpus study indicated that the system is simple to use, yet complex enough to cover the many different ways in which biologists attribute knowledge statements. We find that the majority of cases of epistemic evaluation in biological text is instantiated by regulatory segments governed by a reporting verb, prototypically of the form: ?These results suggest?. To see if this correlation to epistemic evaluation holds at larger volumes, we plan to try out the above structure in an NLP environment. To begin this, we are examining the case where Value = 2/3 and Source = (I)A: in other words, the author posits a claim. These clauses constitute a specific subset of Propositional Content, which we are calling ?Claimed Knowledge Updates? (S?ndor, ?. and de Waard, A., 2012). We are exploring whether an automated syntactic parsing system, combined with a specific subset of reporting verbs will allow the identification of such authorial claims of new knowledge. We plan to use this knowledge to explore what linguistic changes occur when these Claimed Knowledge Updates are cited, and study how knowledge attribution and epistemic modality erode, in the evolution from a claim to a fact. Acknowledgments We wish to thank Eduard Hovy for providing the insight that modality can be thought of like sentiment, and our anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.
