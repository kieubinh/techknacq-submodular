        "Transliteration is the transformation of a piece of text from one language's writing system into another.",
        "Since the transformation is mostly explained as local substitutions, deletions, and insertions, we treat word transliteration as a sequence labeling problem (Ganesh et al., 2008; Reddy and Waxmon-sky, 2009), using linear-chain conditional random fields as our model (Lafferty et al., 2001; Sha and Pereira, 2003).",
        "We tailor this model to the transliteration task in several ways.",
        "First, for the Arabic-English task, each Arabic input is paired with multiple valid English transliteration outputs, any of which is judged to be correct.",
        "To effectively exploit these multiple references during learning, we use a training objective in which the model may favor some correct transliterations over the others.",
        "Computationally efficient inference is achieved by encoding the references in a lattice.",
        "Second, inference for our first-order sequence labeling model requires a runtime that is quadratic in the number of labels.",
        "Since our labels are character n-grams in the target language, we must cope with thousands of labels.",
        "To make the most of each inference call during training, we apply a mini-batch training algorithm which converges quickly.",
        "Finally, we wish to consider some global features that would render exact inference intractable.",
        "We therefore use a reranking model (Collins, 2000).",
        "We demonstrate the performance benefits of these modifications on the Arabic-English transliteration task, using the open-source library cdec (Dyer et al., 2010)1 for learning and prediction."
