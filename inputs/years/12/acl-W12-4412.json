        "Machine transliteration is the phonetic transcription of names across languages and is essential in numerous natural language processing applications, such as machine translation, cross-language information retrieval/extraction, and automatic lexicon acquisition (Li et al., 2009).",
        "It can be either phoneme-based, grapheme-based, or a hybrid of the above.",
        "The phoneme-based approach transforms source and target names into comparable phonemes for an intuitive phonetic similarity measurement between two names (Knight and Graehl, 1998; Virga and Khudanpur, 2003).",
        "The grapheme-based approach, which treats transliteration as statistical machine translation problem under monotonic constraint, aims to obtain a direct orthographical mapping (DOM) to reduce possible errors introduced in multiple conversions (Li et al., 2004).",
        "The hybrid approach attempts to utilize both phoneme and grapheme information (Oh and Choi, 2006).",
        "Phoneme-based approaches are usually not good enough, because name entities have various etymological origins and transliterations are not always decided by pronunciations (Li et al., 2004).",
        "The state-of-the-art of transliteration approach is bilingual DOMs without intermediate phonetic projections (Yang et al., 2010).",
        "Due to the success of CRF on sequential labeling problem (Lafferty et al., 2001), numerous machine transliteration systems applied it.",
        "Some of them treat transliteration as a two-stage sequential labeling problem: the first stage predicts syllable boundaries of source names, and the second stage uses those boundaries to get corresponding characters of target names (Yang et al., 2010; Qin and Chen, 2011).",
        "Dramatically decreasing the cost of training with complex features is the major advantage of two-stage methods, but their downside is, compared to one-stage methods, features of target language are not directly applied in the first stage.",
        "Richer context generally gains better results of sequential labeling, but squeezed performance always comes with a price of computational complexity.",
        "To balance cost and benefit for English-to-Chinese (E2C) transliteration, this work compares the one-stage method with the two-stage one, using additional features of AV (Feng et al., 2004) and M2M-aligner as an initial alignment (Jiampojamarn et al., 2007), to explore where the best investment reward is.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 briefly introduces related works, including two-stage methods and AV.",
        "The machine transliteration system using M2M-aligner, CRF models, and AV features in this work is explained in Section 3.",

        "To recover from error propagations of the pipeline, a joint optimization of two-stage CRF method is then proposed to utilize n-best candidates of source name segmentations (Yang et al. 2010).",
        "Another approach to resist errors from the first stage is split training data into pools to lessen computation cost of sophisticated CRF models for the second stage (Qin and Chen, 2011)."
