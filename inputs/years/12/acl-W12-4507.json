        "The coreference resolution task is a complicated and challenging issue of natural language processing.",
        "Although many sub-problems, such as noun phrase to noun phrase and pronouns to noun phrase, are contained in this issue, it is interesting that humans do not get too confused when they determine whether two mentions refer to the same entity.",
        "We also believe that automatic systems should copy the human behavior (Kai-Wei et al., 2011).",
        "In our understanding, the basis for human making judgment on different sub-problems is different and limited.",
        "Although there are some complicated and ambiguous cases in this task, and we are not able to cover all the prior knowledge of human mind, which plays a vital role in his solution, the mixed deterministic model we constructed can solve a big part of this task.",
        "We present a mixed deterministic model for coreference resolution in the CoNLL-2012 shared task (Sameer et al., 2011).",
        "Different methods such as Relaxation labeling (Emili et al., 2011), Best-Link (Kai-Wei et al., 2011), Entropy Guided Transformation Learning (Cicero et al., 2011) and deterministic models (Heeyoung et al., 2011), were attempted in the CoNLL-2011 shared task (Sameer et al., 2011).",
        "The system performance reported by the task shows that a big part of this task has been solved but some sub-problems need more exploration.",
        "We also participate in the Chinese closed and open tracks.",
        "However, the lack of linguistic annotations makes it more difficult to build a deterministic model.",
        "Basic solutions such as Hobbs Algorithm and Center Theory have been listed in (Wang et al., 2002; Jun et al., 2007).",
        "The recent research on Chinese contains non-anaphors detection using a composite kernel (Kong Fang, et al., 2012(a)) and a tree kernel method to anaphora resolution of pronouns (Kong Fang et al., 2012(b)).",
        "We accept the thought of Stanford (Karthik et al., 2010; Heeyoung et al., 2011).",
        "In Stanford system the coreference resolution task is divided into several problems and each problem is solved by rule based methods.",
        "For English we did some research on mention detection which uses Decision Tree to decide whether the mention ?it?",
        "should refer to some other mention.",
        "For Chinese we submit closed and open result.",
        "The lack of gender,",
        "number and name entities make it more difficult for the Chinese closed task and we try to extract information from the training data to help enhance the performance.",
        "For the open task, we use some dictionaries such as appellation dictionary, gender dictionary, geographical name dictionary and temporal word dictionary (Bo et al., 2009), and some tools such as conversion of pinyin-tocharacter and LTP which is a Chinese parser that can generate the features such as Part-of-Speech, Parse bit, Named Entities (Liu et al., 2011) to generate the similar information.",
