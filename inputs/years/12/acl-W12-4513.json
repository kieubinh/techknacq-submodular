        "Both the CoNLL-2011 (Pradhan et al., 2011) and CoNLL2012 (Pradhan et al., 2012) shared tasks focus on resolving coreference on the OntoNotes corpus.",

        "The Illinois-Coref system uses a machine learning approach to coreference, with an inference procedure that supports straightforward inclusion of domain knowledge via constraints.",
        "The system first uses heuristics based on Named Entity recognition, syntactic parsing, and shallow parsing to identify candidate mentions.",

        "The Best-Link approach scans candidate mentions in a document from left to right.",
        "At each mention, if certain conditions are satisfied, the pairwise scores of all previous mentions are considered, together with any constraints that apply.",
        "If one or more viable",
        "links is available, the highest-scoring link is selected and added to the set of coreference links.",
        "After the scan is complete, the transitive closure of edges is taken to generate the coreference clusters, each cluster corresponding to a single predicted entity in the document.",
        "The formulation of this best-link solution is as follows.",
        "For two mentions u and v, u < v indicates that the mention u precedes v in the document.",
        "Let yuv be a binary variable, such that yuv = 1 only if u and v are in the same cluster.",

        "Mention detection is a crucial component of an end-to-end coreference system, as mention detection errors will propagate to the final coreference chain.",
        "Illinois-Coref implements a high recall and low precision rule-based system that includes all noun phrases, pronouns and named entities as candidate mentions.",
        "The error analysis shows that there are two main types of errors.",
        "Non-referential Noun Phrases.",
        "Non-referential noun phrases are candidate noun phrases, identified through a syntactic parser, that are unlikely to refer to any entity in the real world (e.g., ?the same time?).",
        "Note that because singleton mentions are not annotated in the OntoNotes corpus, such phrases are not considered as mentions.",
        "Non-referential noun phrases are a problem, since during the coreference stage they may be incorrectly linked to a valid mention, thereby decreasing the precision of the system.",
        "To deal with this problem, we use the training data to count the number of times that a candidate noun phrase happens to be a gold mention.",
        "Then, we remove candidate mentions that frequently appear in the training data but never appear as gold mentions.",
        "Relaxing this approach, we also take the predicted head word and the words before and after the mention into account.",
        "This helps remove noun phrases headed by a preposition (e.g., the noun ?fact?",
        "in the phrase ?in fact?).",
        "This strategy will slightly degrade the recall of mention detection, so we tune a threshold learned on the training data for the mention removal.",
        "Incorrect Mention Boundary.",
        "A lot of errors in mention detection happen when predicting mention boundaries.",
        "There are two main reasons for boundary errors: parser mistakes and annotation inconsistencies.",
        "A mistake made by the parser may be due to a wrong attachment or adding extra words to a mention.",
        "For example, if the parser attaches the relative clause inside of the noun phrase ?President Bush, who traveled to China yesterday?",
        "to a different noun, the algorithm will predict ?President Bush?",
        "as a mention instead of ?President Bush, who traveled to China yesterday?",
        "; thus it will make an error, since the gold mention also includes the relative clause.",
        "In this case, we prefer to keep the candidate with a larger span.",
        "On the other hand, we may predict ?President Bush at Dayton?",
        "instead of ?President Bush?, if the parser incorrectly attaches the prepositional phrase.",
        "Another example is when extra words are added, as in ?Today President Bush?.",
        "A correct detection of mention boundaries is crucial to the end-to-end coreference system.",
        "The results in (Chang et al., 2011, Section 3) show that the baseline system can be improved from 55.96 avg F1 to 56.62 in avg F1 by using gold mention boundaries generated from a gold annotation of the parsing tree and the name entity tagging.",
        "However, fixing mention boundaries in an end-to-end system is difficult and requires additional knowledge.",
        "In the current implementation, we focus on a subset of mentions to further improve the mention detection stage of the baseline system.",
        "Specifically, we fix mentions starting with a stop word and mentions ending with a punctuation mark.",
        "We also use training data to learn patterns of inappropriate mention boundaries.",
        "The mention candidates that match the patterns are re",
        "moved.",
        "This strategy is similar to the method used to remove non-referential noun phrases.",
        "As for annotation inconsistency, we find that in a few documents, a punctuation mark or an apostrophe used to mark the possessive form are inconsistently added to the end of a mention.",
        "The problem results in an incorrect matching between the gold and predicted mentions and downgrades the performance of the learned model.",
        "Moreover, the incorrect mention boundary problem also affects the training phase because our system is trained on a union set of the predicted and gold mentions.",
        "To fix this problem, in the training phase, we perform a relaxed matching between predicted mentions and gold mentions and ignore the punctuation marks and mentions that start with one of the following: adverb, verb, determiner, and cardinal number.",
        "For example, we successfully match the predicted mention ?now the army?",
        "to the gold mention ?the army?",
        "and match the predicted mention ?Sony ?s?",
        "to the gold mention ?Sony.?",
