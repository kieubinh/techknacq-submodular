        "A number of high-performance coreference resolution (CR) systems have been created for English in the past decades, implementing both rule-based and statistical approaches.",
        "For other languages, however, the situation is far less optimistic.",
        "For Romance and German languages, several systems have been developed and evaluated, in particular, at the SemEval-2010 track 1 on Multilingual Coreference Resolution (Recasens et al., 2010).",
        "For other languages, individual approaches have been proposed, covering specific subparts of the task, most commonly pronominal anaphors (cf., for example, (Iida and Poesio, 2011; Arregi et al., 2010) and many others).",
        "Two new languages, Arabic and Chinese, have been proposed for the CoNLL-2012 shared task (Pradhan et al., 2012).",
        "They present a challenging problem: the systems are required to provide entity mention detection (EMD) and design a proper coreference resolver for both languages.",
        "At UniTN/Essex, we have focused on these parts of the task, relying on a modified version of our last-year submission for English.",
        "Most state-of-the-art full-scale coreference resolution systems rely on handwritten rules for the mention detection subtask.1 For English, such rules may vary from corpus to corpus, reflecting specifics of particular guidelines (e.g. whether nominal pre-modifiers can be mentions, as in MUC, or not, as in most other corpora).",
        "However, for each corpus, such heuristics can be adjusted in a straightforward way.",
        "Creating a robust rule-based EMD module for a new language, on the contrary, is a challenging issue that requires substantial linguistic knowledge.",
        "In this paper, we advocate a novel approach, recasting parse-based EMD as a statistical problem.",
        "We consider a node-filtering model that does not rely on any linguistic expertise in a given language.",
        "Instead, we use tree kernels (Moschitti, 2008; Moschitti, 2006) to induce a classifier for mention NP-nodes automatically from the data.",
        "Another issue to be solved when designing a coreference resolution system for a new language is a possible lack of relevant linguistic information.",
        "Most state-of-the-art CR algorithms rely on relatively advanced linguistic representations of mentions.",
        "This can be seen as a remarkable shift 1Statistical EMD approaches have been proved useful for ACE-style coreference resolution, where mentions are basic units belonging to a restricted set of semantic types.",
        "from knowledge-lean approaches of the late nineties (Harabagiu and Maiorano, 1999).",
        "In fact, modern systems try to account for complex coreference links by incorporating lexicographic and world knowledge, for example, using WordNet (Harabagiu et al., 2001; Huang et al., 2009) or Wikipedia (Ponzetto and Strube, 2006).",
        "For languages other than English, however, even the most basic properties of mentions can be intrinsically difficult to extract.",
        "For example, Baran and Xue (2011) have shown that a complex algorithm is needed to identify the number property of Chinese nouns.",
        "Both Arabic and Chinese have long linguistic traditions and therefore most grammar studies rely on terminology that can be very confusing for an outsider.",
        "For example, several works on Arabic (Hoyt, 2008) mention that nouns can be made definite with the suffix ?Al-?, but this is not a semantic, but syntactic definiteness.",
        "Without any experience in Arabic, one can hardly decide how such ?syntactic definiteness?",
        "might affect coreference.",
        "In the present study, we have used the information provided by the CoNLL organizers to try and extract at least some linguistic properties of mentions for Arabic and Chinese.",
        "We have run several experiments, evaluating the impact of such very basic knowledge on the performance level of a coreference resolution system.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In the next section we briefly describe the general architecture and the system for English, focusing on the adjustments made after the last year competition.",
        "Section 3 is devoted to new languages: we first discuss our EMD module and then describe the procedures for extracting linguistic knowledge.",
        "Section 4 discusses the impact of our solutions to the performance level of a coreference resolver.",
        "The official evaluation results are presented in Section 5."

        "Our CoNLL submission is based on BART (Versley et al., 2008).",
        "BART is a modular toolkit for coreference resolution that supports state-of-the-art statistical approaches to the task and enables efficient feature engineering.",
        "BART has originally been created and tested for English, but its flexible modular architecture ensures its portability to other languages and domains.",
        "The BART toolkit has five main components: preprocessing pipeline, mention factory, feature extraction module, decoder and encoder.",
        "In addition, an independent LanguagePlugin module handles all the language specific information and is accessible from any component.",
        "The architecture is shown in Figure 1.",
        "Each module can be accessed independently and thus adjusted to leverage the system's performance on a particular language or domain.",
        "The preprocessing pipeline converts an input document into a set of linguistic layers, represented as separate XML files.",
        "The mention factory uses these layers to extract mentions and assign their basic properties (number, gender etc).",
        "The feature extraction module describes pairs of mentions {Mi,Mj}, i < j as a set of features.",
        "At the moment we have around 45 different feature extractors, encoding surface similarity, morphological, syntactic, semantic and discourse information.",
        "Note that no language-specific information is encoded in the extractors explicitly: a language-independent representation, provided by the Language Plugin, is used to compute feature values.",
        "For CoNLL-2012, we have created two additional features: lemmata-match (similar to string match, but uses lemmata instead of tokens) and number-agreement-du (similar to commonly used number agreement features, but supports dual number).",
        "The encoder generates training examples through a process of sample selection and learns a pairwise classifier.",
        "Finally, the decoder generates testing examples through a (possibly distinct) process of sample selection, runs the classifier and partitions the mentions into coreference chains."

        "We have therefore mainly relied on the CoNLL2011 version of our system (Uryupina et al., 2011) for the current submission, providing only minor adjustments.",
        "Thus, we have modified our preprocess",
        "mapping them into MUC types required by BART.",

        "Mention detection is rarely considered to be a separate task.",
        "Only very few studies on coreference resolution report on their EMD techniques.",
        "Existing corpora of coreference follow different approaches to mention annotation: this includes defining mention boundaries (basic vs. maximal NPs), alignment procedures (strict vs. relaxed with manually annotated minimal spans vs. relaxed with automatically extracted heads), the position on singleton and/or non-referential mentions (annotated vs. not).",
        "The CoNLL-2011/2012 guidelines take a very strict view on mention boundaries: only the maximal spans are annotated and no approximate matching is allowed.",
        "Moreover, the singleton mentions (i.e. not participating in coreference relations) are not marked.",
        "This makes the mention detection task for OntoNotes extremely challenging, especially for the two new languages: on the one hand, one has to provide exact boundaries; on the other hand, it is hard to learn such information explicitly, as not all the candidate mentions are annotated.",
        "Most CoNLL-2011 systems relied on handwritten rules for the mention detection subtask.",
        "This was mainly possible due to the existence of well-studied and thoroughly documented head-detection rules for English, available as a description for reimplementing (Collins, 1999) or as a downloadable package.",
        "Consider the following example:",
        "(1) ..((the rising price)NP2 of (food)NP3)NP1 ..",
        "In this fragment, three nominal phrases can be identified, with the first one (?the rising price of food?)",
        "spanning over the two others (?the rising price?)",
        "and (?food?).",
        "According to the OntoNotes annotation guidelines, the second noun phrase cannot be a mention, because it is embedded in an upper NP and they share the same head noun.",
        "The third noun phrase, on the contrary, could be a mention?even though it's embedded in another NP, their heads are different.",
        "Most CoNLL-2011 participants used as a backbone a heuristic discarding embedded noun phrases.",
        "For less-known languages, however, this heuristic is only applicable as long as we can compute an NP's head reliably.",
        "Otherwise it's hard to distinguish between candidate mentions similar to NP1 and to NP2 in the example above.",
        "A set of more refined heuristics is typically applied to discard or add some specific types of mentions.",
        "For example, several studies (Bergsma and Yarowsky, 2011) have addressed the issue of detecting expletive pronouns in English.",
        "Again, in the absence of linguistic expertise, one can hardly engineer such heuristics for a new language manually.",
        "We have investigated the possibility of learning mention boundaries automatically from the OntoNotes data.",
        "We recast the problem as an NP-node filtering task: we analyze automatically computed parse trees and consider all the NP-nodes to be candidate instances to learn a classifier of correct vs. incorrect mention nodes.",
        "Clearly, this approach cannot account for mentions that do not correspond to NP-nodes.",
        "However, as Table 1 shows, around 85- 89% of all the mentions, both for Arabic and Chinese, are NP-nodes.",
        "total numbers and percentage of mentions.",
        "We use tree kernels (Moschitti, 2008; Moschitti, 2006) to induce a classifier that labels an NP node and a part of the parse tree that surrounds it as ?mention.",
        "Two integer parameters control the selection of the relevant part of the parse tree, allowing for pruning the nodes that are far above or far below the node of interest.",
        "Our classifier is supposed to decide whether an NP-node is a mention of a real-world object.",
        "Such mentions, however, are annotated in OntoNotes as positive instances only when they corefer with some other mentions.",
        "The classifier works as a preprocessor for a CR system and therefore has no information that would allow it to discriminate between singleton vs. non-singleton mentions.",
        "One can investigate possibilities for joint EMD and CR to alleviate the problem.",
        "We have adopted a simpler solution: we tune a parameter (cost factor) that controls the precision/recall trade-off to bias the classifier strongly towards recall.",
        "We use a small subset (1-5%) of the training data to train the EMD classifier.",
        "We tune the EMD parameters to optimize the overall performance: we run the classifier to extract mentions for the whole training and development sets, run the coreference resolver and record the obtained result (CoNLL score).",
