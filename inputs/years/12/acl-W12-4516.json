        "2007), compared to MUC (Chinchor, 2001; Chinchor and Sundheim, 2003) and ACE (Doddington et al. 2000) corpora, is a large-scale, multilingual corpus for general anaphoric coreference that covers entities and events not limited to noun phrases or a limited set of entity types.",
        "It greatly stimulates the research on this challenging problem ?",
        "Coreference Resolution.",
        "Moreover, resources like WordNet (Miller, 1995) and the advancement of different kinds of syntactic and semantic analysis technologies, make it possible to do in-depth research on this topic, which is demanded in most of natural language processing applications, such as information extraction, machine translation, question answering, summarization, and so on.",
        "Our group is exploring how to extract information from grain/cereal related Chinese text for business intelligence.",
        "This shared task provides a good platform for advancing our research on IE related topics.",
        "We experiment with a machine learning strategy to model multilingual coreference for the CoNLL-2012 shared task (Pradhan et al. 2012).",
        "Two steps are taken to detect coreference in text: mention detection and mention clustering.",
        "We consider mentions that correspond to a word or an internal node in a syntactic tree and ignore the rest mentions, as we think a mention should be a valid meaningful unit of a sentence.",
        "Maximal entropy algorithm is used to model what a mention is and how two mentions link to each other.",
        "Generic features are designed to facilitate these modeling.",

        "Our system performs poor on the Arabic data, and has relatively high precision but low recall.",

        "Figure 1 gives the architecture of our CoNLL-2012 system, which consists of four pipelined processing modules: pre-processing, mention detection, mention clustering, and post-processing.",
        "Pre-processing: this module reads in the data files in CoNLL format and rebuilds the syntactic and semantic analysis trees in memory.",
        "Mention Detection: this module chooses potential substructures on the syntactic parsing trees and determines whether they are real mentions.",
        "Mention Clustering: this module compares pairs of mentions and links them together.",
        "Post-processing: this module removes singleton mentions and produces the final results.",
        "To facilitate the processing, the data files of the same languages are combined together to form big files for training, development, and test respectively.",
        "Compared to the CoNLL-2011 shared task, the task of this year focuses on the multilingual capacity of a corefernece resolution system.",
        "We plan to take a generic solution for different languages rather than customized approach to some languages with special resources.",
        "In other words, our official system didn't take any special processing for data of different languages but used the same strategy and feature sets for all three languages.",
        "Stanford's Rule-based method succeeded in resolving the coreferences in English text last year (Pradhan et al. 2011; Lee et al. 2011).",
        "Therefore, we planed to incorporate the results of a rule-based system (simple or complex as the Stanford's system) if available and derive some relevant features for our machine learning engine.",
        "However, due to limited time and resources, we failed to implement in our official system such a solution integrating rules within the overall statistical model.",
        "Intuitively, mentions are meaningful substructures of sentences.",
        "We thus assume that a mention should be a word or a phrasal substructure of a parsing tree.",
        "Mention detection modules focus on these mentions and ignore others that do not correspond to a valid phrasal substructure.",
        "A widely used machine learning algorithm in solving different NLP problems, Maximal Entropy (Berger et al1996), is used to model mentions and detect links between them.",
        "Compared with Naive Bayes algorithm, Maximum entropy does not assume statistical independence of the different features.",
        "In our system, Le Zhang's maximum entropy package (Zhang, 2006) is integrated.",
