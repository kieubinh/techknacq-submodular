        "Kleene1 is a finite-state programming language in the tradition of the AT&T Lextools (Roark and Sproat, 2007),2 the SFST-PL language (Schmid, 2005),3 the Xerox/PARC finite-state toolkit (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003)4 and FOMA (Hulde?n, 2009b),5 all of which provide higher-level programming formalisms built on top of low-level finite-state libraries.",
        "Kleene itself is built on the OpenFst library",
        "(Allauzen et al., 2007),6 developed by Google Labs and NYU's Courant Institute.",
        "The design and implementation of the language were motivated by three main principles, summarized as Syntax Matters, Licensing Matters and Open Source Matters.",
        "As for the syntax, Kleene allows programmers to specify weighted or unweighted finite-state machines (FSMs)?",
        "including acceptors that encode regular languages and two-projection transducers that encode regular relations?using regular expressions, alternation-rule syntax and right-linear phrase-structure grammars.",
        "The regular-expression operators are borrowed, as far as possible, from familiar Perl-like and academic regular expressions, and the alternation rules are based on the ?rewrite rules?",
        "made popular by Chomsky and Halle (Chomsky and Halle, 1968).",
        "Borrowing from general-purpose programming languages, Kleene also provides variables, lists and functions, plus nested code blocks and familiar control structures such as if-else statements and while loops.",
        "As for the licensing, Kleene, like the OpenFst library, is released under the Apache License, Version 2.0, and its other dependencies are also released under this and similar permissive licenses that allow commercial usage.",
        "In contrast, many notable finite-state implementations, released under the GPL and similar licenses, are restricted to academic and other non-commercial use.",
        "The Kleene code is also open-source, allowing users to examine, correct, augment and even adopt the code if the project should ever be",
        "It is hoped that Kleene will provide an attractive development environment for experts and students.",
        "Pre-edited Kleene scripts can be run from the command line, but a graphical user interface is also provided for interactive learning, programming, testing and drawing of FSMs.",
        "Like comparable implementations of finite-state machines, Kleene can be used to implement a variety of useful applications, including spell-checking and -correction, phonetic modeling, morphological analysis and generation, and various kinds of pattern matching.",
        "The paper continues with a brief description the Kleene language, the current state of development, and plans for the future."

        "plus.",
        "To improve the readability of expressions, spaces are not significant, unless they appear inside square brackets or are explicitly literalized inside double quotes or with a preceding backslash.",
        "In a language like Kleene where alphabetic symbols are literal, and the expression dog denotes three literal symbols, d, o and g, concatenated together, there must be a way to distinguish variable names from simple concatenations.",
        "The Kleene solution is to prefix variable names that are bound to FSM values with a dollar-sign sigil, e.g. $myvar.",
        "Once defined, a variable name can be used inside subsequent regular expressions, as in the following example, which models a fragment of Esperanto verb morphology.",
        "Similarly, names of functions that return FSMs are distinguished with the $?",
        "sigil.",
