        "Particular areas of interest include determining the relationship between an event mention and a time expression (timex), as well as determining the relationship between two event mentions.",
        "The latter, which we refer to as event-event (E-E) temporal classification is the focus of this work.",
        "For a given event pair which consists of two events e1 and e2 found anywhere within an article, we want to be able to determine if e1 happens before e2 (BEFORE), after e2 (AFTER), or within the same time span as e2 (OVERLAP).",
        "Consider this sentence1: At least 19 people were killed and 114 people were wounded in Tuesday's southern Philippines airport blast, officials said, but reports said the death toll could climb to 30.",
        "Three event mentions found within the sentence are bolded.",
        "We say that there is an OVERLAP relationship between the ?killed ?",
        "wounded?",
        "event pair as these two events happened together after the airport blast.",

        "said?, and ?wounded ?",
        "said?",
        "event pairs, as the death and injuries happened before reports from the officials.",
        "Being able to infer these temporal relationships allows us to build up a better understanding of the text in question, and can aid several natural language understanding tasks such as information extraction and text summarization.",
        "For example, we can build up a temporal characterization of an article by constructing a temporal graph denoting the relationships between all events within an article (Verhagen et al., 2009).",
        "This can then be used to help construct an event timeline which layouts sequentially event mentions in the order they take place (Do et al., 2012).",
        "The temporal graph can also be used in text summarization, where temporal order can be used to improve sentence ordering and thereby the eventual generated summary (Barzilay et al., 2002).",
        "Given the importance and value of temporal relations, the community has organized shared tasks",
        "to spur research efforts in this area, including the TempEval-1, 2 and 3 evaluation workshops (Ver-hagen et al., 2009; Verhagen et al., 2010; Uzzaman et al., 2012).",
        "Most related work in this area have focused primarily on the task defintitions of these evaluation workshops.",
        "In the task definitions, E-E temporal classification involves determining the relationship between events found within the same sentence, or in adjacent sentences.",
        "For brevity we will refer to this loosely as intra-sentence E-E temporal classification in the rest of this paper.",
        "This definition however is limiting and insufficient.",
        "It was adopted as a trade-off between completeness, and the need to simplify the evaluation process (Verhagen et al., 2009).",
        "In particular, one deficiency is that it does not allow us to construct the complete temporal graph we seek.",
        "As illustrated in Figure 1, being able to perform only intra-sentence E-E temporal classification may result in a forest of disconnected temporal graphs.",
        "A sentence s3 separates events C and D, as such an intra-sentence E-E classification system will not be able to determine the temporal relationship between them.",
        "While we can determine the relationship between A and C in the figure with the use of temporal transitivity rules (Setzer et al., 2003; Verhagen, 2005), we cannot reliably determine the relationship between say A and",

        "Horizontal lines depict sentences s1 to s4, and the circles identify events of interest.",
        "In this work, we seek to overcome this limitation, and study what can enable effective article-wide E-E temporal classification.",
        "That is, we want to be able to determine the temporal relationship between two events located anywhere within an article.",
        "The main contribution of our work is going beyond the surface lexical and syntactic features commonly adopted by existing state-of-the-art approaches.",
        "We suggest making use of semantically motivated features derived from discourse analysis instead, and show that these discourse features are superior.",
        "While we are just focusing on E-E temporal classification, our work can complement other approaches such as the joint inference approach proposed by Do et al. (2012) and Yoshikawa et al. (2009) which builds on top of event-timex (E-T) and E-E temporal classification systems.",

        "Recognizing that the temporal relationships between event pairs and time expressions are related, Yoshikawa et al. (2009) proposed the use of a joint inference model and showed that improvements in performance are obtained.",
        "However this gain is attributed to the joint inference model they had developed, making use of similar surface features.",

        "Other than event co-reference information, they adopted the same mix of lexico-syntactic features.",
        "Underlying these disparate data-driven methods for similar temporal processing tasks, the reviewed works all adopted a similar set of surface features including vocabulary features, part-of-speech tags, constituent grammar parses, governing grammar nodes and verb tenses, among others.",
        "We argue that these features are not sufficiently discriminative of temporal relationships because they do not explain how sentences are combined together, and thus are unable to properly differentiate between the different temporal classifications.",

        "We performed ablation tests to assess the efficacy of the discourse features used in our earlier experiments.",
        "Starting from the full system, we dropped each discourse feature in turn to see the effect this has on overall system performance.",
        "Our test is performed over the same data set, again with 5-fold cross-validation.",
        "The results in Table 3 show a statistically significant (based on the one-tailed Student's paired t-test) drop in F1 in each case, which proves that each of our proposed features is useful and required.",
        "From the ablation tests, we also observe that the RST discourse feature contributes the most to overall system performance while the PDTB discourse feature contributes the least.",
        "However we should not conclude prematurely that the former is more useful than the latter; as the results are obtained using parses from automatic systems, and are not reflective of the full utility of ground truth discourse annotations.",
        "Useful Relations.",
        "The ablation test results showed us that discourse relations (in particular RST dis",
        "tically significance against the full system with p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively.",
        "course relations) are the most important in our system.",
        "We have also motivated our work earlier with the intuition that certain relations such as the RST ?Result?",
        "and the PDTB ?Cause?",
        "relations provide very useful temporal cues.",
        "We now offer an introspection into the use of these discourse relations.",
        "Figure 8 illustrates the relative proportion of temporal classes in which each RST and PDTB relation appear.",
        "If the relations are randomly distributed, we should expect their distribution to follow that of the temporal classes as shown in Table 1.",
        "However we see that many of the relations do not follow this distribution.",
        "For example, we observe that several relations such as the RST ?Condition?",
        "and PDTB ?Cause?",
        "relations are almost exclusively found within AFTER and BEFORE event pairs only, while the RST ?Manner-means?",
        "and PDTB ?Synchrony?",
        "relations occur in a disproportionately large number of OVERLAP event pairs.",
        "These relations are likely useful in disambiguating between the different temporal classes.",
        "To verify this, we examine the convolution tree fragments that lie on the support vector of our SVM classifier.",
        "The work of Pighin and Moschitti (2010) in linearizing kernel functions allows us to take a look at these tree fragments.",
        "Applying the linearization process leads to a different classifier from the one we have used.",
        "The identified tree fragments are therefore just an approximation to those actually employed by our classifier.",
        "However, this analysis still offers an introspection as to what relations are most influential for classification."

        "The former consists of fragments containing relations such as ?Temporal?",
        "and ?Condition?, while the latter has a sole fragment containing ?Manner-Means?.",

        "Segment Numbers.",
        "From the ablation test results, text segmentation is the next most important feature after the RST discourse feature.",
        "This is interesting given that the defined feature structure for topical text segmentation is not the most intuitive.",
        "By using actual segment numbers, the structure may not generalize well for articles of different lengths for example, as each article may have vastly different number of segments.",
        "The transition across segments may also not carry the same semantic significance for different articles.",
        "Our experiments have however shown that this feature design is useful in improving performance.",
        "This is likely because: 1.",
        "The default settings of the text segmentation system we had used are such that precision is favoured over recall (Kazantseva and Szpakow-icz, 2011, p. 292).",
        "As such there is just an average of between two to three identified segments per article.",
        "This makes the feature more generalizable despite making use of actual segment numbers.",
        "2.",
        "The style of writing in newswire articles which we are experimenting on generally follows common journalistic guidelines.",
        "The semantics behind the transitions across the coarse-grained segments that were identified are thus likely to be of a similar nature across many different articles.",
        "We leave for future work an investigation into whether more fine-grained topic segments can lead to further performance gains.",
        "In particular, it will be interesting to study if work on argumentative zoning (Teufel and Kan, 2011) can be applied to newswire articles, and whether the subsequent learnt document structures can be used to delineate topic segments more accurately.",
        "Error Analysis.",
        "Besides examining the features we had used, we also want to get a better idea of the errors made by our classifier.",
        "Recall that we are using separate one-vs-all classifiers for each of the temporal classes, so each of the three classifiers generates a column in the aggregate confusion matrix shown in Table 5.",
        "In cases where none of the SVM classifiers return a positive confidence value, we do not assign a temporal class (captured as column N).",
        "The high number of event pairs which are not assigned to any temporal class explains the lower recall scores obtained by our system, as observed in Table 2.",
        "classifying into (O)VERLAP, (B)EFORE, (A)FTER, and (N)o result.",
        "Additionally, an interesting observation is the low percentage of OVERLAP instances that our classifier managed to predict correctly.",
        "About 57% of BEFORE and AFTER instances are classified cor",
        "rectly, however only about 15% of OVERLAP instances are correct.",
        "Figure 10 offers more evidence to suggest that our classifier works better for the BEFORE and AFTER classes than the OVERLAP class.",
        "We see that as sentence gap increases, we achieve a fairly consistent performance for both BEFORE and AFTER instances.",
        "OVERLAP instances are concentrated where the sentence gap is less than 7, with the best accuracy figure coming in below 30%.",
        "Although not definitive, this may be because our data set consists of much fewer OVERLAP instances than the other two classes.",
        "This bias may have led to insufficient training data for accurate OVERLAP classification.",
        "It will be useful to investigate if using a more balanced data set for training can help overcome this problem."
