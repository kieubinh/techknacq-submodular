        "Animacy detection has proven useful for a variety of syntactic and semantic tasks, such as anaphora and coreference resolution (Ora?san and Evans, 2007; Lee et al., 2013), verb argument disambiguation (Dell?Orletta et al., 2005) and dependency parsing (?vrelid and Nivre, 2007).",
        "Existing approaches for animacy detection typically rely on two types of information: linguistic databases, and syntactic cues observed from the corpus.",
        "They usually combine two types of approaches: rule based systems, and machine learning techniques.",
        "In this paper we explore a slightly different angle: we wish to design an animacy detector whose decisions are interpretable and correctable, so that downstream semantic modeling systems can revisit those decisions as needed.",
        "Thus here, we avoid defining a large number of features and then using a machine learning method such as boosted trees, since such methods, although powerful, result in hard-to-interpret systems.",
        "Instead, we explore combining interpretable voting models using machine learning ?",
        "Work performed while visiting Microsoft Research.",
        "only to reweight their votes.",
        "We show that such an approach can indeed result in a high performing system, with animacy detection accuracies in the mid 90% range, which compares well with other reported rates.",
        "Ensemble methods are well known (see for example, Dietterich (2000)) but our focus here is on using them for interpretability while still maintaining accuracy."

        "Previous work uses several different definitions of animacy.",
        "Ora?san and Evans (2007) define animacy in the service of anaphora resolution: an NP is considered animate ?if its referent can also be referred to using one of the pronouns he, she, him, her, his, hers, himself, herself, or a combination of such pronouns (e.g. his/her )?.",
        "Although useful for the task at hand, this has counterintuitive consequences: for example, baby may be considered animate or inanimate, and ant is considered inanimate (Ibid., Figure 1).",
        "Others have argued that animacy should be captured by a hierarchy or by categories (Aissen, 2003; Silverstein, 1986).",
        "For instance, Zaenen et al.",
        "(2004) propose three levels of animacy (human, other animate and inanimate), which cover ten categories of noun phrases, with categories like ORG (organization), ANIM (animal) and MAC (intelligent machines such as robots) categorised as other animate.",
        "Bowman and Chopra (2012) report results for animacy defined both this way and with the categories collapsed to a binary (animate, inanimate) definition."

        "Evans and Ora?san (2000) propose a rule-based system based on the WordNet taxonomy (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "Each synset is ascribed a binary animacy label based on its unique beginner.",
        "A given noun is then associated with the fraction of its animate synsets (where all synsets are taken to be animate or inanimate) and one minus that fraction, similarly for a given verb.",
        "Animacy is then ascribed by applying a series of rules imposing thresholds on those fractions, together with rules (and a gazetteer) to detect names and acronyms, and a rule triggered by the occurrence of who, or reflexives, in the NP.",
        "In later work, Ora?san and Evans (2007) extend the algorithm by propagating animacy labels in the WordNet graph using a chi-squared test, and then apply a k-nearest neighbor classifier based on four lexical features.",
        "In their work, the only context used was the animacy of the verb in the NP, for heads of subject NPs (e.g., the subject of eat is typically animate).",
        "?vrelid (2009) and Bowman and Chopra (2012) extend this idea by using dependency relations to generate features for their classifier, enabled by corpora created by Zaenen et al. (2004).",

        "pattern to the Google n-gram corpus (Brants and Franz, 2006) to assign animacy (see the List model in Section 5 for details).",

        "We adopt a definition of animacy closest to the binary version in Bowman and Chopra (2012): we define an entity to be animate if it is alive and has the ability to move under its own will.",
        "We adopt this simple definition because it fits well with the common meaning and is therefore less error prone, both in terms of incorporation into higher level models, and for labeling (Ora?san and Evans (2007) report that the labeling of animacy tuned for anaphora proved challenging for the judges).",
        "We also apply the label to single noun tokens where possible: the only exceptions are compound names (?Sarah Jones?)",
        "which are treated as single units.",
        "Thus, for example, ?puppy food?",
        "is treated as two words, with puppy animate and food inanimate.",
        "A more complete definition would extend this to all noun phrases, so that puppy food as a unit would be inanimate, a notion we plan to revisit in future work.",
        "Note that even this simple definition presents challenges, so that a binary label must be applied depending on the predominant meaning.",
        "In ?A plate of chicken,?",
        "chicken is treated as inanimate since it refers to food.",
