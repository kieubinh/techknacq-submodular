        "Supervised prediction models typically require a large amount of labeled data for training.",

        "Recently, domain adaptation has been proposed to exploit existing labeled data in a related source domain to assist the prediction model training in the target domain (Ben-David et al., 2006; Blitzer et al., 2006; Daume?",
        "III, 2007; Blitzer et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2012).",
        "As an effective tool to reduce annotation effort, domain adaptation has achieved success in various cross-domain natural language processing (NLP) systems such as document categorization (Dai et al., 2007), sentiment classification (Blitzer et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2012; Mejova and Srinivasan, 2012; Chen et al., 2011), email spam detection (Jiang and Zhai, 2007), and a number of other NLP tasks (Blitzer et al., 2011; Daume?",
        "III, 2007).",
        "One primary challenge of domain adaptation lies in the distribution divergence of the two domains in the original feature representation space.",
        "For example, documents about books may contain very different high-frequency words and discriminative words from documents about kitchen.",
        "A good cross-domain feature representation thus has been viewed as critical for bridging the domain divergence gap and facilitating domain adaptation in the NLP area (Ben-David et al., 2006, 2010).",
        "Many domain adaptation works have been proposed to learn new cross-domain feature representations (Blitzer et al., 2006, 2011).",
        "Though demonstrated good performance on certain problems, these works mostly induce new feature representations in an unsupervised way, without taking the valuable label information into account.",
        "In this work, we present a novel supervised representation learning approach to discover a latent representation of words which is not only generalizable across domains but also informative to the classification task.",
        "Specifically, we propose a hier",
        "archical multinomial Naive Bayes model with latent word cluster variables to perform supervised word clustering on labeled documents from both domains.",
        "Our model directly models the relationships between the observed document label variables and the latent word cluster variables.",
        "The induced cluster representation of each word thus will be informative for the classification labels, and hence discriminative for the target classification task.",
        "We train this directed graphical model using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, which maximizes the log-likelihood of the observations of labeled documents.",
        "The induced cluster distribution of each word can then be used as its generalizable representation to construct new cluster-based representation of each document.",
        "For domain adaptation, we train a supervised learning system with labeled data from both domains in the new representation space and apply it to categorize test documents in the target domain.",

        "In this paper, we proposed a novel supervised representation learning method to tackle domain adaptation by inducing predictive latent features based on supervised word clustering.",
        "With the soft word clustering produced, we can transform all documents from the two domains into a unified low-dimensional feature space for effective training of cross-domain NLP prediction system.",
        "We conducted extensive experiments on cross-domain document categorization tasks on Reuters-21578 dataset and cross-domain sentiment classification tasks on Amazon product reviews.",
        "Our empirical results demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed approach."
