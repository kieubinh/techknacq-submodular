        "Bilingual dictionaries can be used to train its model, but many of their entries are actually translation but not transliteration.",
        "Such non-transliteration pairs hurt the transliteration model and should be eliminated beforehand.",

        "It enables the statistical machine transliteration to be bootstrapped from bilingual corpora.",
        "This approach is beneficial because it does not require carefully-developed bilingual transliteration dictionaries and it can learn domain-specific transliteration patterns from bilingual corpora in the target domain.",
        "However, their transliteration mining approach is sample-wise; that is, it makes a decision whether a bilingual phrase pair is transliteration or not.",

        "The sample-wise mining cannot make a correct decision of partial transliteration on the aligned candidate, and may introduces noise to the statistical transliteration model.",
