        "This preference model uses CP-nets (Boutilier et al., 2004), a representation of preferences for which algorithms for computing equilibrium strategies exist.",
        "We adapt those algorithms to predict the trades executed in the game.",

        "The baselines differ, however, in how they identify the trading partners and resources in an executed trade.",
        "The first baseline predicts a trade according to the first Offer and the last person to Accept, and if the Offer doesn't specify one of the resources then it is chosen randomly (similar random choices complete all partial predictions in all the models we consider here): e.g., for Table 1 this would predict that Kittles gave clay to Rainbow (which is incorrect) in exchange for",
        "something that's chosen randomly (which will probably be incorrect).",
        "The second baseline uses the last Offer and the last person to Accept: e.g., for Table 1 this predicts that Kittles gave ore to Rainbow (correct) for something random (probably incorrect).",
        "The third baseline uses the last Offer or Counteroffer, whichever is latest, and the last person to Accept: e.g., for Table 1 this correctly predicts that Kittles gave ore to Rainbow in exchange for wheat.",

        "One then takes the executed trade to be the result of this unification process at the point where the last Accept occurs.",
        "This makes the same predictions as the third baseline for Table 1, but outperforms it in the corpus example (1) by predicting the correct and complete trade (i.e., Rainbow gave Kittles sheep for wheat, rather than for something random):",

        "A predicted trade counts as correct only if it specifies the right participants and the correct type of resources offered and received (we ignore their quantity).",
        "True Positives (TP) are thus examples where the model correctly predicts not only that a trade happened, but also the correct partners and resources; Wrong Positives (WP), on the other hand, constitute a correct prediction that there was a trade but errors on the partners and/or resources involved (so WPs undermine accuracy).",

        "For the first baseline 34 examples are like this; for the second and third baselines it's 32.",
        "In contrast, this problem occurs only once with the fourth baseline, and all the trades predicted by our method are complete, making random choice unnecessary.",
        "Moreover, the first three baselines often make incorrect predictions about the addressee or resources exchanged because in contrast to our model and the fourth baseline, they don't track how potential trades evolve through a sequence of offers and counteroffers.",

        "One major problem with the fourth baseline is that, in contrast to our model, it does not track each player's attitude towards the current offer.",
        "Instead, like all our baselines, it relies on the presence of an Accept act to predict that there's a trade.2 But several corpus examples are like (2), in which a trade is executed but there's no Accept act, thus yielding a False Negative (FN) for all four baselines: (2) Joel: anyone have sheep or wheat Cardlinger: neither :( Joel: will give clay or ore Euan: not just now Jon: got a wheat for a clay (Joel gives clay to Jon and receives wheat) 2We tried a baseline that doesn't rely on the presence of an Accept act, but rather predicts a trade whenever default unification yields a complete offer.",
        "It performed worse than the fourth baseline.",
        "So overall, our analysis shows that using CP-nets significantly outperforms all baselines that don't model how preferences evolve in the dialogue, and error analysis yields evidence that our model outperforms the fourth baseline because our model supports reasoning about player preferences, rational behavior and equilibrium strategies.",
