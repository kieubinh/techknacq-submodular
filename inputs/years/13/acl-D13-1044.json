        "This paper proposes a framework for automatically engineering features for two important tasks of question answering: answer sentence selection and answer extraction.",

        "Tree kernels applied to such structures enable a simple way to generate highly discriminative structural features that combine syntactic and semantic information encoded in the input trees.",
        "We conduct experiments on a public benchmark from TREC to compare with previous systems for answer sentence selection and answer extraction.",
        "The results show that our models greatly improve on the state of the art, e.g., up to 22% on F1 (relative improvement) for answer extraction, while using no additional resources and no manual feature engineering."

      "text": [
        "Question Answering (QA) systems are typically built from three main macro-modules: (i) search and retrieval of candidate passages; (ii) reranking or selection of the most promising passages; and (iii) answer extraction.",
        "The last two steps are the most interesting from a Natural Language Processing viewpoint since deep linguistic analysis can be carried out as the input is just a limited set of candidates.",
        "Answer sentence selection refers to the task of selecting the sentence containing the correct answer among the different sentence candidates retrieved by a search engine.",
        "Answer extraction is a final step, required for factoid questions, consisting in extracting multi-words constituting the synthetic answer, e.g., Barack Obama for a question: Who is the US president?",
        "The definition of rules for both tasks is conceptually demanding and involves the use of syntactic and semantic properties of the questions and its related answer passages.",
        "For example, given a question from TREC QA1: Q: What was Johnny Appleseed's real name?",
        "and a relevant passage, e.g., retrieved by a search engine: A: Appleseed, whose real name was John Chapman, planted many trees in the early 1800s.",
        "a rule detecting the semantic links between Johnny Appleseed's real name and the correct answer John Chapman in the answer sentence has to be engineered.",
        "This requires the definition of other rules that associate the question pattern real name ?",
        "(X) with real name is(X) of the answer sentence.",
        "Although this can be done by an expert NLP engineer, the effort for achieving the necessary coverage and a reasonable accuracy is not negligible.",
        "An alternative to manual rule definition is the use of machine learning, which often shifts the problem",
        "to the easier task of feature engineering.",
        "Unfortunately, when the learning task is semantically difficult such as in QA, e.g., features have to encode combinations of syntactic and semantic properties.",
        "Thus their extraction modules basically assume the shape of high-level rules, which are, in any case, essential to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy.",
        "For example, the great IBM Watson system (Ferrucci et al., 2010) uses a learning to rank algorithm fed with hundreds of features.",
        "The extraction of some of the latter requires articulated rules/algorithms, which, in terms of complexity, are very similar to those constituting typical handcrafted QA systems.",
        "An immediate consequence is the reduced adaptability to new domains, which requires a substantial re-engineering work.",
        "In this paper, we show that tree kernels (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Moschitti, 2006) can be applied to automatically learn complex structural patterns for both answer sentence selection and answer extraction.",
        "Such patterns are syntactic/semantic structures occurring in question and answer passages.",
        "To make such information available to the tree kernel functions, we rely on the shallow syntactic trees enriched with semantic information (Severyn et al., 2013b; Severyn et al., 2013a), e.g., Named Entities (NEs) and question focus and category, automatically derived by machine learning modules, e.g., question classifier (QC) or focus classifier (FC).",
        "More in detail, we (i) design a pair of shallow syntactic trees (one for the question and one for the answer sentence); (ii) connect them with relational nodes (i.e., those matching the same words in the question and in the answer passages); (iii) label the tree nodes with semantic information such as question category and focus and NEs; and (iv) use the NE type to establish additional semantic links between the candidate answer, i.e., an NE, and the focus word of the question.",
        "Finally, for the task of answer extraction we also connect such semantic information to the answer sentence trees such that we can learn factoid answer patterns.",
        "We show that our models are very effective in producing features for both answer selection and extraction by experimenting with TREC QA corpora and directly comparing with the state of the art, e.g., (Wang et al., 2007; Yao et al., 2013).",
        "The results show that our methods greatly improve on both tasks yielding a large improvement in Mean Average Precision for answer selection and in F1 for answer extraction: up to 22% of relative improvement in F1, when small training data is used.",
        "Moreover, in contrast to the previous work, our model does not rely on external resources, e.g., WordNet, or complex features in addition to the structural kernel model.",
        "The reminder of this paper is organized as follows, Sec. 2 describes our kernel-based classifiers, Sec. 3 illustrates our question/answer relational structures also enriched with semantic information, Sec. 4 describes our model for answer selection and extraction, Sec. 5 illustrates our comparative experiments on TREC data, Sec. 6 reports on our error analysis, Sec. 7 discusses the related work, and finally, Sec. 8 derives the conclusions."

        "There are several sources of errors affecting the final performance of our answer extraction system: (i) chunking, (ii) named entity recognition and semantic linking, (iii) answer extraction, (iv) single best answer selection.",
        "Chunking.",
        "Our system uses text spans identified by a chunker to extract answer candidates, which makes it impossible to extract answers that lie outside the chunk boundaries.",
        "Nevertheless, we found this to be a minor concern since for 279 out of total 284 candidate sentences from TREC 13 the answers are recoverable within the chunk spans.",
        "Semantic linking.",
        "Our structural model relies heavily on the ability of NER to identify the relevant entities in the candidate sentence that can be further linked to the focus word of the question.",
        "While our answer extraction model is working on all the NP chunks, the semantic tags from NER serve as a strong cue for the classifier that a given chunk has a high probability of containing an answer.",
        "Typical off-the-shelf NER taggers have good precision and low recall, s.t.",
        "many entities as potential answers are missed.",
        "In this respect, a high recall entity linking system, e.g., linking to wikipedia entities (Ratinov et al., 2011), is required to boost the quality of candidates considered for answer extraction.",
        "Finally, improving the accuracy of question and focus classifiers would allow for having more accurate input representations fed to the learning algorithm.",
        "Answer Extraction.",
        "Our answer extraction model acts as a high recall system, while it suffers from low precision in extracting answers for many incorrect sentences.",
        "Improving the precision without sacrificing the recall would ease the successive task of best answer selection, since having less incorrect answer candidates would result in a better final performance.",
        "Introducing additional constraints in the form of semantic tags to allow for better selection of answer candidates could also improve our system.",

        "This step has a dramatic impact on the final performance of the answer extraction system resulting in a large drop of recall, i.e., from 82.0 to 70.8 before and after voting respectively.",
        "Hence, a more involved model, i.e.,",
        "performing joint answer sentence re-ranking and answer extraction, is required to yield a better performance."

        "However, their methods lack the use of important relational information between a question and a candidate answer, which is essential to learn accurate relational patterns.",
        "In this respect, a solution based on enumerating relational links was given in (Zan-zotto and Moschitti, 2006; Zanzotto et al., 2009) for the textual entailment task but it is computationally too expensive for the large dataset of QA.",

      "heading": "8 Conclusions",
      "text": [
        "Our paper demonstrates the effectiveness of handling the input structures representing QA pairs directly vs. using explicit feature vector representations, which typically require substantial feature engineering effort.",
        "Our approach relies on a kernel-based learning framework, where structural kernels, e.g., tree kernels, are used to handle automatic feature engineering.",
        "It is enough to specify the desired type of structures, e.g., shallow, constituency, dependency trees, representing question and its candidate answer sentences and let the kernel learning framework learn to use discriminative tree fragments for the target task.",
        "An important feature of our approach is that it can effectively combine together different types of syntactic and semantic information, also generated by additional automatic classifiers, e.g., focus and question classifiers.",
        "We augment the basic structures with additional relational and semantic information by introducing special tag markers into the tree nodes.",
        "Using the structures directly in the kernel learning framework makes it easy to integrate additional relational constraints and semantic information directly in the structures.",
        "The comparison with previous work on a public",
        "benchmark from TREC suggests that our approach is very promising as we can improve the state of the art in both answer selection and extraction by a large margin (up to 22% of relative improvement in F1 for answer extraction).",
        "Our approach makes it relatively easy to integrate other sources of semantic information, among which the use of Linked Open Data can be the most promising to enrich the structural representation of q/a pairs.",
        "To achieve state-of-the-art results in answer sentence selection and answer extraction, it is sufficient to provide our model with a suitable tree structure encoding relevant syntactic information, e.g., using shallow, constituency or dependency formalisms.",
        "Moreover, additional semantic and relational information can be easily plugged in by marking tree nodes with special tags.",
        "We believe this approach greatly eases the task of tedious feature engineering that will find its applications well beyond QA tasks."
