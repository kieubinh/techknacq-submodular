        "information needs often go well beyond their knowledge of foreign languages.",
        "In such cases, efficient machine translation and cross-lingual information retrieval systems are needed.",
        "Machine translation already has a decades long history and an array of commercial systems were already deployed, including Google Translate 1 and Systran 2.",
        "However, due to the intrinsic difficulty of the task, a number of related problems remain open, including: the gap between text semantics and statistically derived translations, the scarcity of resources in a large majority of languages and the quality of automatically obtained resources and translations.",
        "While the first challenge is general and inherent to any automatic approach, the second and the third can be at least partially addressed by an appropriate exploitation of multilingual resources that are increasingly available on the Web.",
        "In this paper we focus on the automatic creation of domain-specific bilingual lexicons.",
        "Such resources play a vital role in Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications that involve different languages.",
        "At first, research on lexical extraction has relied on the use of parallel corpora (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "The scarcity of such corpora, in particular for specialized domains and for language pairs not involving English, pushed researchers to investigate the use of comparable corpora (Fung, 1998; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2003).",
        "These corpora include texts which are not exact translation of each other but share common features such as domain, genre, sampling period, etc.",
        "The basic intuition that underlies bilingual lexicon creation is the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954) which puts that words with similar meanings occur in similar contexts.",
        "In a multilingual formulation, this hypothesis states that the translations of a word are likely to appear in similar lexical environments across languages (Rapp, 1995).",
        "The standard approach to bilingual lexicon extraction builds",
        "on the distributional hypothesis and compares context vectors for each word of the source and target languages.",
        "In this approach, the comparison of context vectors is conditioned by the existence of a seed bilingual dictionary.",
        "A weakness of the method is that poor results are obtained for language pairs that are not closely related (Ismail and Manandhar, 2010).",
        "Another important problem occurs whenever the size of the seed dictionary is small due to ignoring many context words.",
        "Conversely, when dictionaries are detailed, ambiguity becomes an important drawback.",
        "We introduce a bilingual lexicon extraction approach that exploits Wikipedia in an innovative manner in order to tackle some of the problems mentioned above.",
        "Important advantages of using Wikipedia are: ?",
        "The resource is available in hundreds of languages and it is structured as unambiguous concepts (i.e. articles).",

        "The languages are explicitly linked through concept translations proposed by Wikipedia contributors.",

        "The comparability of concept descriptions in different languages is highly variable.",

        "?",
        "Domains are unequally covered in Wikipedia (Halavais and Lackaff, 2008) and efficient domain targeting is needed.",
        "The approach introduced in this paper aims to draw on Wikipedia's advantages while appropriately addressing associated challenges.",
        "Among the techniques devised to mine Wikipedia content, we hypothesize that an adequate adaptation of Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007) is fitted to our application context.",
        "ESA was already successfully tested in different NLP tasks, such as word relatedness estimation or text classification, and we modify it to mine specialized domains, to characterize these domains and to link them across languages.",
        "The evaluation of the newly introduced approach is realized on four diversified specialized domains (Breast Cancer, Corporate Finance, Wind Energy and Mobile Technology) and for two pairs of languages: French-English and Romanian-English.",
        "This choice allows us to study the behavior of different approaches for a pair of languages that are richly represented and for a pair that includes Romanian, a language that has fewer associated resources than French and English.",

        "In addition to the basic approach based on ESA (denoted ESA), we evaluate the performances of a method so-called DicoSpec in which the translations are extracted from a generic dictionary and a method we called ESASpec which combine ESA and DicoSpec.",
        "DICOSpec is based on the generic dictionary we presented in subsection 3.6 and proceeds as follows: we extract a list of translations for each word to be translated from the generic dictionary.",
        "The domain specificity introduced in subsection 3.5 is then used to rank these translations.",
        "For instance, the french term port referring in the Mobile Technology domain, to the system that allows computers to receive and transmit information is translated into port and seaport.",
        "According to domain specificity values, the following ranking is obtained: the English term port obtain the highest specificity value (0.48).",
        "seaport comes next with a specificity value of 0.01.",
        "In ESASpec, the translations set out in the translations lists proposed by both ESA and the generic dictionary are weighted according to their domain specificity values.",
        "The main intuition behind this method is that by adding the information about the domain specificity, we obtain a new ranking of the bilingual extraction results.",
        "The obtained results are displayed in table 4.",
        "The comparison of state of the art method shows that BA13 performs better than STAPP and MP11 for French-English and has comparable performances",
        "state of the art methods were used for comparison: STAPP is the standard approach, MP11 is the improvement of the standard approach introduced in (Morin and Prochasson, 2011), BA13 is a recent method that we developed (Bouamor et al., 2013).",
        "Dicospec exploits a generic dictionary, combined with the use of domain specificity (see Subsection 3.5).",
        "ESA stands for the ESA based approach introduced in this paper (see Figure 1).",
        "ESAspec combines the results of Dicospec and ESA.",
        "for RO-EN.",
        "Consequently, we will use BA13 as the main baseline for discussing the newly introduced approach.",
        "The results presented in Table 4 show that ESAspec clearly outperforms the three baselines for the four domains and the two pairs of languages tested.",
        "When comparing ESAspec to BA13 for French-English, improvements range between 0.19 for Corporate Finance and 0.56 for Wind Energy.",
        "For RO-EN, the improvements vary from 0.1 for Corporate Finance to 0.5 for Wind Energy.",
        "Also, except for the Corporate Finance domain in Romanian, the performance variation across domains is much smaller for ESAspec than for the three state of the art methods.",
        "This shows that ESAspec is more robust to domain change and thus more generic.",
        "The results obtained with ESA are significantly better than those obtained with Dicospec and ESAspec, their combination, further improves the results.",
        "The main contribution to ESAspec performances comes from ESA, a finding that validates our assumption that the adequate use of a rich multilingual resource such as Wikipedia is appropriate for specialized lexicon translation.",
        "Dicospec is a simple method that ranks the different meanings of a candidate word available in a generic dictionary but its average performances are comparable to those of BA13 for FR-EN and higher for RO-EN.",
        "This finding advocates for the importance of good quality generic dictionaries in specialized lexicon translation approaches.",
        "However, it is clear that such dictionaries are far from being sufficient in order to cover all possible domains.",
        "There is no clear correlation between domain size and quality of results.",
        "Although richer than the other three domains, Corporate Finance has the lowest associated performances.",
        "This finding is probably explained by the intrinsic difficulty of each domain.",
        "When passing from FR-EN to RO-EN the average performance drop is more significant for BA13 than for the ESA based methods.",
        "The result indicates that our approach is more robust to language change."

      "heading": "5 Conclusion",
      "text": [
        "We have presented a new approach to the creation of specialized bilingual lexicons, one of the central",
        "building blocks of machine translation systems.",
        "The proposed approach directly tackles two of the major challenges identified in the Introduction.",
        "The scarcity of resources is addressed by an adequate exploitation of Wikipedia, a resource that is available in hundreds of languages.",
        "The quality of automatic translations was improved by appropriate domain delimitation and linking across languages, as well as by an adequate statistical processing of concepts similar to a word in a given context.",
        "The main advantages of our approach compared to state of the art methods come from: the increased number of languages that can be processed, from the smaller sensitivity to structured resources and the appropriate domain delimitation.",
        "Experimental validation is obtained through evaluation with four different domains and two pairs of languages which shows consistent performance improvement.",
        "For French-English, two languages that have rich associated Wikipedia representations, performances are very interesting and are starting to approach those of manual translations for three domains out of four (F-Measure@20 around 0.8).",
        "For Romanian-English, a pair involving a language with a sparser Wikipedia representation, the performances of our method drop compared to French-English .",
        "However, they do not decrease to the same extent as those of the best state of the art method tested.",
        "This finding indicates that our approach is more general and, given its low language dependence, it can be easily extended to a large number of language pairs.",
        "The results presented here are very encouraging and we will to pursue work in several directions.",
        "First, we will pursue the integration of our method, notably through comparable corpora creation using the data driven domain delimitation technique described in Subsection 3.5.",
        "Equally important, the size of the domain can be adapted so as to find enough context for all the words in domain reference lists.",
        "Second, given a word in a context, we currently exploit all similar concepts from the target language.",
        "Given that comparability of article versions in the source and the target language varies, we will evaluate algorithms for filtering out concepts from the target language that have low alignment with their source language versions.",
        "A final line of work is constituted by the use of distributional properties of texts in order to automatically rank parts of concept descriptions (i.e. articles) by their relatedness to the candidate word.",
        "Similar to the second direction, this process involves finding comparable text blocks but rather at a paragraph or sentence level than at the article level."
