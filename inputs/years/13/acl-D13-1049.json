        "Generating the appropriate word order for the target language has been one of the fundamental problems in machine translation since the ground setting work of Brown et al. (1990).",
        "Lexical reordering approaches (Tillmann, 2004; Zens and Ney, 2006) add a reordering component to standard phrase-based translation systems (Och and Ney, 2004).",
        "Because the reordering model is trained discriminatively, it can use a rich set of lexical features.",
        "However, it only has access to the local context which often times is insufficient to make the long-distance reordering decisions that are necessary for language pairs with significantly different word order.",
        "Preordering (sometimes called pre-reordering or simply reordering) approaches (Xia and McCord, 2004; Collins et al., 2005) preprocess the input in such a way that the words on the source side appear closer to their final positions on the target side.",
        "Because preordering is performed prior to word alignment, it can improve the alignment process and can then be combined with any subsequent translation model.",
        "Most preordering models use a source-side syntactic parser and perform a series of tree transformations.",
        "Approaches that do not use a parser exist as well and typically induce a hierarchical representation that also allows them to perform long-distance changes (Tromble and Eisner, 2009; DeNero and Uszkoreit, 2011; Neubig et al., 2012).",
        "Models that use a source-side parser differ on two main dimensions: the way tree transformations are expressed, and whether they are built manually or learned from data.",
        "One common type of tree transformation are rewrite rules.",
        "These typically involve some condition under which the transformation can be applied (e.g., a noun and an adjective found in the same clause) and the transformation itself (e.g., move the adjective after the noun).",
        "These rules can be designed manually (Collins et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2007) or learned from data (Xia and McCord, 2004; Habash, 2007; Genzel, 2010; Wu et al., 2011).",
        "Another type of tree transformations uses ranking functions to implement precedence-based reordering.",
        "Here, a function assigns a numerical value to every word in a clause, intended to express the precedence of the word in the target language.",
        "The reordering operation is then to sort the words according to their assigned values.",
        "The ranking function",
        "can be designed manually (Xu et al., 2009) or trained from data (Yang et al., 2012).",
        "This approach is particularly effective for Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) languages.",
        "In this work we present a simple classifier-based preordering model.",
        "Our model operates over dependency parse trees and is therefore able to perform long-distance reordering decisions, as is typical for preordering models.",
        "But instead of deterministic rules or ranking functions, we use discriminative classifiers to directly predict the final word order, using rich (bi-)lexical and syntactic features.",
        "We present two models.",
        "The first model uses a classifier to directly predict the permutation order in which a family of words (a head word and all its children) will appear on the target side.",
        "This approach is similar in spirit to the work of Li et al. (2007), except that they use constituency parse trees and consider only nodes with 2 or 3 children.",
        "We instead work with dependency trees and consider much larger head-children sets.",
        "Our second model is designed to decompose the exponential search space of all possible permutations.",
        "The prediction task is broken into two separate steps.",
        "In the first step, for each child word a binary classifier decides whether it appears before or after its parent in the target language.",
        "In the second step, we predict the best order of the words on each side of the parent.",
        "We show that the second approach is never worse than the first one and sometimes significantly better.",
        "We present experiments on 22 language pairs from different language families using our preordering approach in a phrase-based system (Och and Ney, 2004), as well as a forest-to-string system (Zhang et al., 2011).",
        "In a first set of experiments, we use the WMT 2010 shared task data (Callison-Burch et al., 2010) and show significant improvements of up to 1.4 BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) on three out of eight language pairs.",
        "In a second set of experiments, we use automatically mined parallel data from the web and build translation systems for languages from various language families.",
        "We obtain especially big improvements in translation quality (2-7 BLEU) when the language pairs have divergent word order (for example English to Indonesian, Japanese, Korean or Malay).",
        "In our experiments on English to and from Hungarian, Dutch, and Portuguese translation, we find that we can obtain consistent improvements in both translation directions.",
        "To additionally verify our improvements we use human raters, who confirm the significance of the BLEU score improvements.",
        "Finally, we compare training the preordering classifiers on small amounts of manually aligned data to training on large quantities of automatically aligned data for English to Arabic, Hebrew, and Japanese.",
        "When evaluated on a pure reordering task, the models trained on manually aligned data perform slightly better, but similar BLEU scores are obtained in both scenarios on an end-to-end translation task."

      "text": [
        "We presented a simple and novel preordering approach that produces substantial improvements in translation accuracy on a large number of languages.",
        "We use a source-side syntactic parser and train discriminative classifiers to predict the order of a parent and its children in the target language, using features from the dependency tree as well as (bi-)lexical features.",
        "To decompose the exponential space of all possible permutations, we introduce the 2-step approach.",
        "We show empirically that this approach is significantly better than directly predicting the full permutation for some languages, and never significantly worse.",
        "We obtain strong results on the WMT 2010 shared task data, observing gains of up to 1.4 BLEU over a state-of-the-art system.",
        "We also show gains of up to 0.5 BLEU over a strong directly comparable preordering system that is based on learning unlexicalized reordering rules.",
        "We obtain improvements of more than 2 BLEU in experiments on additional languages.",
        "The gains are especially large for languages where the sentence structure is very different from English.",
        "These positive results are confirmed in human side-by-side evaluations.",
        "When comparing our approach to syntax-based translation systems (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Galley et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2006; Dyer and Resnik, 2010) we note that both approaches use syntactic information for reordering decisions.",
        "Our preordering approach has several advantages.",
        "First, be",
        "It was a real whirlwind .",
        "essary for choosing the correct word order.",
        "cause preordering is performed before learning word alignments, it has the potential to improve the word alignments.",
        "Second, by using discriminative classifiers we can take advantage of lexical features.",
        "Finally, preordering can be combined with syntax-based translation models and our results confirm the complementary benefits that can be obtained.",
        "Compared to other preordering models, our approach has the obvious problem of having to make predictions over an exponential set of permutations.",
        "We show that this is not an insurmountable difficulty: our 2-step approach decomposes the exponential space, often leading to much easier prediction tasks.",
        "Even when the number of possible permutations is large we can limit ourselves to the K most popular permutations.",
        "On the other hand, our approach provides important advantages.",
        "Compared to systems that use rewrite rules, it is much easier to encode useful knowledge that by itself is not enough to determine a full rewrite rule, such as ?a determiner is unlikely to be the last word in a clause.?",
        "Perhaps more importantly, our model provides an elegant answer to the question of what to do when multiple rewrite rules can be applied.",
        "Previous work has employed different heuristics: use the most specific rule (Xia and McCord, 2004), use all applicable rules (Genzel, 2010), or use the most frequent rule (Wu et al., 2011).",
        "In our model there is no need for such heuristics ?",
        "all the ?rules?",
        "are treated as features to a discriminative classifier, and the task of analyzing their interactions is handled by the learning algorithm.",
        "Compared to preordering systems that use ranking functions, our model has the advantage that it can encode information about the complete permutation.",
        "For example, for three source words A, B, and C, we can naturally express the useful prior that",
        "est weights for choosing the position of ?real?",
        "relative to ?whirlwind.?",

        "PrevSibling refers to the child's sibling immediately to the left (the determiner ?a?).",
        "NoNextSibling and NoNextHeadSibling mean that the child and head do not have a sibling to the right.",
        "A-B-C and C-B-A are likely orders but CAB is not.",
