        "Hierarchical phrase-based translation models (Chiang, 2007) are widely used in machine translation systems due to their ability to achieve local fluency through phrasal translation and handle non-local phrase reordering using synchronous context-free grammars.",
        "A large number of previous works have tried to introduce grammaticality to the translation process by incorporating syntactic constraints into hierarchical translation models.",
        "Despite some differences in the granularity of syntax units (e.g., tree fragments (Galley et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2006), treebank tags (Shen et al., 2008; Chiang, 2010), and extended tags (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006)), most previous work incorporates syntax into hierarchical translation models by explicitly decorating translation rules with syntactic annotations.",
        "These approaches inevitably exacerbate the data sparsity problem and cause other problems such as increased grammar size, worsened derivational ambiguity, and unavoidable parsing errors (Hanneman and Lavie, 2013).",
        "In this paper, we propose a factored approach that incorporates soft source syntactic constraints into a hierarchical string-to-dependency translation model (Shen et al., 2008).",
        "The general ideas are applicable to other hierarchical models as well.",
        "Instead of enriching translation rules with explicit syntactic annotations, we keep the original translation rules intact, and factorize the use of source syntactic constraints through two separate models.",
        "The first is a syntax mismatch model that introduces source syntax into the nonterminals of translation rules, and measures the degree of syntactic compatibility between a translation rule and the source spans it is applied to during decoding.",
        "When a hierarchical translation rule is extracted from a parallel training sentence pair, we determine a tag for each nonterminal based on the dependency parse of the source sentence.",
        "Instead of fragmenting rule statistics by directly labeling nonterminals with tags,",
        "we keep the original string-to-dependency translation rules intact and associate each nonterminal with a distribution of tags.",
        "That distribution is then used to measure the syntactic compatibility between the syntactic context from which the translation rule is extracted and the syntactic analysis of a test sentence.",
        "The second is a syntax-based reordering model that takes advantage of phrasal cohesion in translation (Fox, 2002).",
        "The reordering model takes a pair of sibling constituents in the source parse tree as input, and uses source syntactic clues to predict the ordering distribution (straight vs. inverted) of their translations on the target side.",
        "The resulting ordering distribution is used in the decoder at the word pair level to guide the translation process.",
        "This separate reordering model allows us to utilize source syntax to improve reordering in hierarchical translation models without having to explicitly annotate translation rules with source syntax.",

        "Using only syntactic phrases is too restrictive in phrasal translation as many useful phrase pairs are not syntactic constituents (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "The syntax-augmented translation model of Zollmann and Venugopal (2006) annotates nonterminals in hierarchical rules with thousands of extended syntactic categories in order to capture the syntactic variations of phrase pairs.",

        "(2009) and Chiang (2010) used soft match features to explicitly model the substitution of nonterminals with different labels; Venugopal et al. (2009) used a preference grammar to soften the syntactic constraints through the use of a preference distribution of syntactic categories; and recently Hanneman and Lavie (2013) proposed a clustering approach to reduce the number of syntactic categories.",
        "Our proposed syntax mismatch model associates nonterminals with a distribution of tags.",

        "The work of Huang et al. (2010) is most similar to ours, with the main difference being that their syntactic categories are latent and learned automatically in a data driven fashion while we simply use treebank tags based on dependency parsing.",

        "Previous efforts to improve reordering for phrase-based systems can be largely classified into two categories.",
        "Approaches in the first category try to reorder words in the source sentence in a preprocessing step to reduce reordering in both word alignment and MT decoding.",

        "Khapra et al., 2013).",
        "Approaches in the second category try to explicitly model phrase reordering in the translation process.",
        "These approaches range from simple distance based distortion models (Koehn et al., 2003) that globally penalizes reordering based on the distorted distance, to lexicalized reordering models (Koehn et al., 2005; Al-Onaizan and Pap-ineni, 2006) that assign reordering preferences of adjacent phrases for individual phrases, and to hierarchical reordering models (Galley and Manning, 2008; Cherry, 2013) that handle reordering preferences beyond adjacent phrases.",
        "Although hierarchical translation models are capable of handling non-local reordering, their accuracy is far from perfect.",
        "Xu et al. (2009) showed that the syntax-augmented hierarchical model (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006) also benefits from reordering source words in a preprocessing step.",
        "Explicitly adding syntax to translation rules helps with reordering in general, but it introduces additional complexities, and is still limited by the context-free nature of hierarchical rules.",
        "Our work exploits an alternative direction that uses an external reordering model to improve word reordering of hierarchical models.",
        "Gao et al. (2011), Xiong et al. (2012), and Li et al. (2013) also studied external reordering models for hierarchical models.",

        "Our syntax-based reordering model exploits phrasal cohesion in translation (Fox, 2002) by modeling the reordering of sibling constituents in the source parse tree, which is similar to the recent work of Yang et al. (2012).",
        "However, the latter focuses on finding the optimal reordering of sibling constituents before MT decoding, while our proposed model generates reordering features that are used together with other MT features to determine the optimal reordering during MT decoding."

        "We evaluate the relaxed method that only annotates source nonterminals with the head POS tag of the underlying phrase if the phrase is a fixed dependency structure.",
        "As shown in Table 3, nonterminal annotation results in a big drop in performance, decreasing the BLEU score of the baseline from 27.82 to 25.54.",
        "This suggests that it is undesirable to further fragment the translation rules.",

        "This improvement is not large enough to compensate for the performance drop caused by annotating the nonterminals.",
        "Our proposed approach, on the other hand, does not modify the translation rules in the baseline system, but only associates each nonterminal with a distribution of tags.",
        "For that reason, it does not suffer from the aforementioned problem.",
        "It achieves exactly the same performance as the baseline system if no source syntactic constraints are imposed during decoding.",
        "When the source syntax mismatch features are used, the proposed approach is able to achieve a gain of 0.41 in BLEU over the baseline system.",
        "Table 4 lists the learned weights of the syntax mismatch features after MT tuning.",
        "The negative weights of f1 and f2 mean that the MT system penalizes source spans that do not have a fixed dependency structure, and it assigns a higher penalty to rules whose nonterminals have a high probability of being extracted from source phrases that do not have a fixed dependency structure.",
        "When the source span has a fixed dependency structure, the MT system prefers translation rules that have a high probability of matching the tag on the source span (feature f4) over the ones that do not match (features f3 and f5).",
