        "Phrase-based models (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004) have been widely used in practical machine translation (MT) systems due to their effectiveness, simplicity, and applicability.",
        "First, as sequences of consecutive words, phrases are capable of memorizing local word selection and reordering, making them an effective mechanism for translating idioms or translations with word insertions or omissions.",
        "Moreover, n-gram language models can be seamlessly integrated into phrase-based decoders since partial translations grow left to right in decoding.",
        "Finally, phrase-based systems can be applicable to most domains and languages, especially for resource-scarce languages without high-accuracy parsers.",
        "However, as phrase-based decoding casts translation as a string concatenation problem and permits arbitrary permutations, it proves to be NP-complete (Knight, 1999).",
        "Therefore, phrase reordering modeling has attracted intensive attention in the past decade (e.g., Och et al., 2004; Tillman, 2004; Zens et al., 2004; Al-Onaizan and Papineni, 2006; Xiong et al., 2006; Koehn et al., 2007; Galley and Manning, 2008; Feng et al., 2010; Green et al., 2010; Bisazza and Federico, 2012; Cherry, 2013).",
        "Among them, reordering models based on inversion transduction grammar (ITG) (Wu, 1997) are one of the important ongoing research directions.",
        "As a formalism for bilingual modeling of sentence pairs, ITG is particularly well suited to predicting ordering shifts between languages.",
        "As a result, a number of authors have incorporated ITG into left-to-right decoding to constrain the reordering space and reported significant improvements (e.g., Zens et al., 2004; Feng et al., 2010).",
        "Along another line, Xiong et al. (2006) propose a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) reordering model based on ITG.",
        "They use the CKY algorithm to recursively merge two blocks (i.e., a pair of source and target strings) into larger blocks, either in a straight or an inverted order.",
        "Unlike lexicalized reordering models (Tillman, 2004; Koehn et al., 2007; Galley and Manning, 2008) that are defined on individual bilingual phrases, the MaxEnt ITG reordering model is a two-category classifier (i.e., straight or inverted) for two arbitrary bilingual phrases of which the source phrases are adjacent.",
        "This potentially alleviates the data sparseness",
        "problem since there are usually a large number of reordering training examples available (Xiong et al., 2006).",
        "As a result, the MaxEnt ITG model and its extensions (Xiong et al., 2008; Xiong et al., 2010) have achieved competing performance as compared with state-of-the-art phrase-based systems.",
        "Despite these successful efforts, the ITG reordering classifiers still face a major challenge: how to extract features from training examples (i.e., a pair of bilingual strings).",
        "It is hard to decide which words are representative for predicting reordering, either manually or automatically, especially for long sentences.",
        "As a result, Xiong et al. (2006) only use boundary words (i.e., the first and the last words in a string) to predict the ordering.",
        "What if we look inside?",
        "Is it possible to avoid manual feature engineering and learn semantic representations from the data?",
        "Fortunately, the rapid development of intersecting deep learning with natural language processing (Bengio et al., 2003; Collobert and Weston, 2008; Collobert et al., 2011; Glorot et al., 2011; Bordes et al., 2011; Socher et al., 2011a; Socher et al., 2011b; Socher et al., 2011c; Socher et al., 2012; Bordes et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2012; Socher et al., 2013; Hermann and Blunsom, 2013) brings hope for alleviating this problem.",
        "In these efforts, natural language words are represented as real-valued vectors, which can be naturally fed to neural networks as input.",
        "More importantly, it is possible to learn vector space representations for multi-word phrases using recursive autoencoders (Socher et al., 2011c), which opens the door to leveraging semantic representations of phrases in reordering models from a neural language modeling point of view.",
        "In this work, we propose an ITG reordering classifier based on recursive autoencoders.",
        "The neural network consists of four autoencoders (i.e., the first source phrase, the first target phrase, the second source phrase, and the second target phrase) and a softmax layer.",
        "The recursive autoencoders, which are trained on reordering examples extracted from word-aligned bilingual corpus, are capable of producing vector space representations for arbitrary multi-word strings in decoding.",
        "Therefore, our model takes the whole phrases rather than only boundary words into consideration when predicting phrase permutations.",
        "Experiments on the NIST 2008 dataset show that our system significantly improves over the MaxEnt classifier by 1.07 in terms of case-insensitive BLEU score."
