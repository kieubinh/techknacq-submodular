        "The k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm is a simple nonparametric method of classification.",
        "It has been applied to various natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as document classification (Masand et al., 1992; Yang and Liu, 1999), part-of-speech tagging (S?gaard, 2011), and word sense disambiguation (Navigli, 2009).",
        "To apply the kNN algorithm, data is typically represented as a vector object in a feature space, and (dis)similarity between data is measured by the distance between the vectors, their inner product, or cosine of the angle between them (Jurafsky and Martin, 2008).",
        "With such a (dis)similarity measure, the unknown class label of a test object is predicted by a majority vote of the classes of its k most similar objects in the labeled training set.",
        "Recent studies (Radovanovic?",
        "et al, 2010a; Radovanovic?",
        "et al, 2010b) have shown that if the feature space is high-dimensional, some objects in the dataset emerge as hubs; i.e., these objects frequently appear in the k nearest neighbors of other objects.",
        "The emergence of hubs may deteriorate the performance of kNN classification and nearest neighbor search in general: ?",
        "If hub objects exist in the training set, they have a strong chance to be a kNN of many test objects.",
        "Because the class of a test object is predicted by a majority vote from its k nearest neighbors, prediction is biased toward the labels of the hubs.",
        "?",
        "In information retrieval, nearest neighbor search finds objects in the database that are most relevant, or similar, to user-provided queries.",
        "If particular objects, such as hubs, are nearly always returned for any query, the retrieved results are probably not very useful.",
        "These drawbacks may hinder application of nearest neighbor methods in NLP, as typical natural language data are extremely high-dimensional (Jurafsky and Martin, 2008) and thus prone to produce hubs."

        "for removing observation bias in the data.",
        "It is a transformation of feature space in a way that the origin of the space is moved to the data centroid (sample mean).",
        "The distance between data objects is not changed by centering, but their inner product and cosine are affected; see Section 3 for detail.",
        "In this paper, we advocate the use of centering as a means of reducing hubs.",
        "Specifically, we propose to measure the similarity of objects by the inner product (not distance or cosine) in the centered feature space.",
        "Our approach is motivated by the observation that the objects similar to the data centroid tend to become hubs (Radovanovic?",
        "et al, 2010a).",
        "This observation suggests that the number of hubs may be reduced if we can define a similarity measure that makes all objects in a dataset equally similar to the centroid (Suzuki et al., 2012).",
        "The inner product in the centered space indeed enjoys this property.",
        "In Section 4, we analyze why hubs emerge under a simple probabilistic model of data, and also give an account of why they are suppressed by centering.",
        "Using both synthetic and real datasets, we show that objects similar to the centroid also emerge as hubs in multi-cluster data (Section 5), so the application of centering is wider than expected.",
        "To further reduce hubs, we also propose to move the origin of the space more aggressively towards hubs, through weighted centering (Section 6).",
        "In Section 7, we show that centering and weighted centering are effective for natural language data.",
