        "Weighted Context Free Grammars (WCFG) define an important class of languages.",
        "Their expressivity makes them good candidates for modeling a wide range of natural language phenomena.",
        "This expressivity comes at a cost: unsupervised learning of WCFG seems to be a particularly hard task.",
        "And while it is a well-studied problem, it is still to a great extent unsolved.",
        "Several methods for unsupervised learning of WCFG have been proposed.",
        "Some rely on heuristics that are used to build incrementally an approximation of the unknown grammar (Adriaans et al., 2000; Van Zaanen, 2000; Tu and Honavar, 2008).",
        "Other methods are based on maximum likelihood estimation, searching for the grammar that has the largest posterior given the training corpus (Baker, 1979; Lari and Young, 1990; Pereira and Schabes, 1992; Klein and Manning, 2002).",
        "Several Bayesian inference approaches have also been proposed (Chen, 1995; Kurihara and Sato, 2006; Liang et al., 2007; Cohen et al., 2010).",
        "These approaches perform parameter estimation by exploiting Markov sampling techniques.",
        "Recently, for the related problem of unsupervised dependency parsing, Gormley and Eisner (2013) proposed a new way of framing the max-likelihood estimation.",
        "In their formulation the problem is expressed as an integer quadratic program subject to non-linear constraints.",
        "They exploit techniques from mathematical programming to solve the resulting optimization.",
        "In spirit, the work by Clark (2001; 2007) is probably the most similar to our approach since both approaches share an algebraic view of the problem.",
        "In his case the key idea is to work with an algebraic representation of a WCFG.",
        "The problem of recovering the constituents of the grammar is reduced to the problem of identifying its syntactic congruence.",
        "In the last years, multiple spectral learning algorithms have been proposed for a wide range of models (Hsu et al., 2009; Bailly et al., 2009; Bailly et al., 2010; Balle et al., 2011; Luque et al., 2012; Cohen et al., 2012).",
        "Since the spectral approach provides a good thinking tool to reason about distributions over ?",
        "?, the question of whether they can be used for unsupervised learning of WCFG seems natural.",
        "Still, while spectral algorithms for unsupervised learning of languages can learn regular languages, tree languages and simple dependency grammars, the frontier to WCFG seems hard to reach.",
        "In fact, the most recent theoretical results on spectral learning of WCFG do not seem to be very encouraging.",
        "Recently, Hsu et al. (2012) showed that the problem of recovering the joint distribution over PCFG derivations and their yields is not identifiable.",
        "Although, for some simple grammar subclasses (e.g. independent left and right children), identification in the weaker sense (over the yields of the grammar) implies strong identification (e.g. over joint distribution of yields and derivations).",
        "In their paper, they propose a spectral algorithm based on a generalization of the method of moments for these restricted subclasses.",
        "Thus one open direction for spectral research consists on defining subclasses of context free languages that can be learned (in the strong sense) from observations of yields.",
        "Yet, an alternative research direction is to consider learnability in the weaker sense.",
        "In this paper we take the second road, and focus on the problem of approximating the distribution over yields generated by a WCFG.",
        "Our main contribution is to present a spectral algorithm for unsupervised learning of WCFG.",
        "Following ideas from Balle et al. (2012), the algorithm is framed as a convex optimization where we search for a low-rank matrix satisfying two types of constraints: (1) Constraints derived from observable statistics over yields; and (2) Constraints derived from certain recurrence relations satisfied by a WCFG.",
        "Our derivations of the learning algorithm illustrate the main ingredients behind the spectral approach to learning functions over ??",
        "which are: (1) to exploit the recurrence relations satisfied by the target family of functions and (2) provide algebraic formulations of these relations.",
        "We alert the reader that although we are able to frame the problem as a convex optimization, the number of variables involved is quite large and prohibits a practical implementation of the method on a realistic scenario.",
        "The experiments we present should be regarded as examples designed to illustrate the behavior of the method.",
        "More research is needed to make the optimization more efficient, and we are optimistic that such improvements can be achieved by exploiting problem-specific properties of the optimization.",
        "Regardless of this, ours is a novel way of framing the grammatical inference problem.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 gives preliminaries on WCFG and the type of functions we will learn.",
        "Section 3 establishes that spectral methods can learn a WCFG from a Hankel matrix containing statistics about context-free cuts.",
        "Section 4 presents the unsupervised algorithm, where we formulate grammar induction as a low-rank optimization.",
