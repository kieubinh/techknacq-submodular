        "The computer study of semantic networks has been around since the advent of computers (Brunet, 1974) and has been used to study semantic relations between concepts and for analyzing semantic data.",
        "Traditionally, a popular lexical database of English is Wordnet (Miller, 1995; Miller and Fellbaum, 1998), which organizes the semantic network in terms of graph theory.",
        "In contrast to manual approaches, the automatic analysis of semantically interesting graph structures of language has received increasing attention.",
        "For example, it has become clear more recently that cycles and triangles play an important role in semantic networks, see e.g., (Dorow et al., 2005).",
        "These results suggest that the underlying semantic structure of language may be discovered through graph-theoretical methods.",
        "This is in line with similar findings in much wider realms than NLP (Eckmann and Moses, 2002).",
        "In this paper, we compare two different types of association networks.",
        "The first network is constructed from an English dictionary (DD), the second from a free association (FA) database (Nelson et al., 2004).",
        "We represent both datasets through directed graphs.",
        "For DD, the nodes are words and the directed edges point from a word to its definition(s).",
        "For FA, the nodes are again words, and each cue word has a directed edge to each association it elicits.",
        "Although the links in these graphs were not constructed by following a rational centralized process, their graph exhibits very specific features and we concentrate on the study of its topological properties.",
        "We will show that these graphs are quite different in global and local structure, and we interpret this as a reflection of the different nature of DD vs. FA.",
        "The first is an objective set of rela",
        "tions between words and their meaning, as explained by other words, while the second reveals the nature of subjective reactions to cue words by individuals.",
        "This matter of fact is reflected by several quantitative differences in the structure of the corresponding graphs.",
        "The main contribution of this paper is an empirical analysis of the way semantic knowledge is structured, comparing two different types of association networks (DD and FA).",
        "We conduct a mathematical analysis of the structure of the graphs to show that the way humans express their thoughts exhibits structural properties in which one can find semantic patterns.",
        "We show that a simple graph-based approach can leverage the information encoded in free association to narrow down the ambiguity of meaning, resulting in precise semantic groups.",
        "In particular, we find that the main strongly connected component of the FA graph (the so-called core) is very cyclic in nature and contains a large predominance of short cycles (i.e., co-links and triangles).",
        "In contrast to the DD graph, bunches of triangles form well-delimited lexical fields of collective semantic knowledge.",
        "This property may be promising for downstream tasks.",
        "Further, the methods developed in this paper may be applicable to graph representations that occur in other problems such as word sense disambiguation (e.g., (Heylighen, 2001; Agirre and Soroa, 2009)) or sentiment polarity induction (Hassan and Radev, 2010; Scheible, 2010).",
        "To show the semantic coherence of these lexical fields of the FA graph, we perform an experiment with human raters and find that cycles are strongly semantically connected even when compared to close neighbors in the graph.",
        "The reader might wonder why sets of pairwise associations can lead to any interesting structure.",
        "One of the deep results in graph theory, (Bolloba?s, 2001), is that in sparse graphs, i.e., in graphs with few links per node, the number of triangles is extremely rare.",
        "Therefore, if one does find many triangles in a graph, they must be not only a signal of non-randomness, but carry relevant information about the domain of research as shown earlier (Eckmann and Moses, 2002)."

        "In both cases, triangles play a crucial role in the local topology and they form the set of elementary concepts of the underlying graph.",
        "We also show that cohesive lexical fields (taking the form of cliques of concepts) constitute essential bricks of meaning, and span the core homogeneously at the global level; 89% of all words in the core belong to at least one triangle, and 77% belong to cliques of triangles containing 4 words (i.e., pairs of triangles sharing an edge or forming tetrahedras).",
        "As the words of a graph of free associations acquire their meaning from the set of associations they are involved in (Deese, 1962), we go a step further by examining the neighborhood of nodes and extracting the statistics of cycles.",

        "-?I call the pairs of triangles sharing an edge the 2-clovers ;-) Comparing dictionaries to free association, we find the free association graph being more concept driven, with words in small clusters being on the same level of abstraction.",
        "Moreover, we think that graphs of free associations could find interesting applications for Word Sense Disambiguation (e.g., (Heylighen, 2001; Agirre and Soroa, 2009)), and could be used for detecting psychological disorders (e.g., depression, psychopathy) or whether someone is lying (Hancock et al., 2013; Kent and Rosanoff, 1910).",
        "Finally, we believe that studying the dynamics of graphs of free associations may be of particular interest for observing the change in meaning of certain words (Deese, 1967), or more generally to follow the cultural evolution arising among a social group."
