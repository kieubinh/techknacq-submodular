        "because all the documents concentrate on the same themes.",
        "When we combine two clusters into one, the summary length should be smaller than the sum of the summary lengths of two original clusters due to some unavoidable common background information but much larger than the summary length of original clusters.",

        "As we do not have golden standard for the new datasets, so we only use the rate-dist measure here.",
        "Results in Table 2,3,4 show the summaries which do not change the predefined length 5 perform significantly worse than the BNP summarization.",
        "All the comparison is statistically significant.",
        "So varying summary length is necessary when the input changes a lot, and our model can just give a good match to the new data.",
        "This characteristic also can be used to give recommended summary length for extractive summarization systems when given unknown data.",
        "Dataset.",
        "Then we observe the summary length distributions and compression ratios according to document size(the length of the whole documents in a cluster).",
        "The average summary length increases (Fig.",
        "6), 5665 bytes is the DUC2004 requirement and 164 words is the best length on original data",
        "Dataset.",
        "while the compression ratios decreases (Fig.",
        "7) as document size grows.",
        "The rule of the compression ratio here agrees with the rule in (Goldstein et al., 1999), although that work is done for single-document summarization."
