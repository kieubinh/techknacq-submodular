        "We determine the usefulness of different language models in aiding the two visual recognition tasks.",

        "Computational linguistics have created many tools for automatic knowledge acquisition which have been successfully applied in many tasks inside the language domain, such as question answering, machine translation, semantic web, etc.",

        "In particular, we aim to determine which language model yields knowledge that is most suitable for use in Computer Vision.",
        "Therefore we test a variety of language models and a linguistically mined knowledge base within two computer vision scenarios: Human action recognition : Recognizing <subject, verb, object> triples based on objects (e.g., car, horse) and scenes (the place that the actions occur, e.g., countryside, forest, office) recognized in images.",

        "subject is always present.",

        "Computer vision can greatly benefit from natural language processing as learning from images requires a prohibitively expensive annotation effort.",
        "A major goal of natural language processing is to obtain general knowledge from text and in this paper we test which model provides the best knowledge for use in the visual domain.",
        "Within the two visual scenarios, we compare three state-of-the-art language models and a knowledge base: (1) A window-based model, which counts co-occurrence frequencies within a fixed window; (2) R-LDA (Se?aghdha, 2010), an extension of LDA that enables generation of joint probabilities; (3) TypeDM (Baroni and Lenci, 2010), a strong Distributional Memory model; (4) ConceptNet (Speer and Havasi, 2013), an automatically generated semantic graph containing concepts with their relations.",
        "We test the language models in two ways: (1) We directly compare the statistics of the linguistic models with statistics extracted from the visual domain.",
        "(2) We compare the linguistic models inside the two computer vision applications, leading to a direct estimation of their usefulness.",
        "To summarize, our main research questions are: (1) Is the knowledge from language compatible with the knowledge from vision?",

        "They can detect animals without having seen training examples by manually defining the attributes of the target animal.",
        "In this work, rather than relying on manual definitions, our aim is to find the best language models built automatically from available corpora to extract relations from natural language.",
        "Currently, human action recognition is popular and mostly studied in video using the Bag-of-Visual-Words method (Delaitre et al., 2010; Everts et al., 2013; Kuehne et al., 2012; Reddy and Shah, 2012; Wang et al., 2013).",
        "In this method one extracts small local visual patches of, say, 24 by 24 pixels by 10 frames at every 12th pixel at every 5th frame.",
        "For each patch local gradients or local movement (optical flow) histograms are calculated.",
        "Then these local visual features are mapped to abstract, predefined ?visual words?, previously obtained using k-means clustering on a set of random features.",
        "While results are good, there are two main drawbacks with this approach.",
        "First of all, human actions are semantic and more naturally recognized through their components (human, objects, scene) rather than through a bag of local gradient/motion patterns.",
        "Hence we use a component-based method for human action recognition.",
        "Second, the number of possible human actions is huge (the number of objects times the number of verbs).",
        "Obtaining annotated visual examples for each action is therefore prohibitively expensive.",
        "So we learn from language models how components combine into human actions."

        "ConceptNet is the most inconsistent with this image data since not enough objects and their relations are extracted from it.",

        "To measure the performance of the two visual recognition scenarios, we use the position pi of the correct action found in the ranked list for each image i.",
        "We report the average ranking over all images (ARI ) and over all objects or actions (ARO, ARA):",
        "where N is the number of images, No is the number of objects and pjo is the average rank of all images having object j.",
        "The average rank over all actions ARA is defined similarly to ARO.",
        "The average rank over all image measures the performance over the image dataset, but infrequent objects/events have little impact on this performance.",
        "The average rank over objects or actions gives more weight to rare examples.",
        "We evaluate the performance of human action recognition in images based on objects and scenes individually, and then study the integration of them.",
        "The training set contains 1,104 images (for training the image relations) and the test set has 710 images.",
        "First, we test how the model predicts an action knowing the actual object and/or scene appearing in an image (given object/scene gold standard), i.e., Ogs, Sgs and OgsSgs in the settings.",
        "After that, we test a complete model which is based on the output of our object recognizer and our scene recognizer (Orec, Srec, OrecSrec).",
        "For each setting, we try different action models, either learnt from the training images (Image), or from each of the language models (TypeDM, R-LDA, Window2, Window20, ConceptNet).",
        "(as there are many <object - scene> relations, only a few are shown on the Y-axises).",
        "The number of relations in the TypeDM is much bigger than in the image model, which shows a more general model than the image one.",
        "Table 5 presents the average ranking over all images.",
        "Results show that the action model learnt directly from the training images achieves the best performance in all settings, even if we give more weight to infrequent actions by taking the average ranking over all actions, as presented in Table 6.",
        "One explanation may be that the action dataset has a limited domain of only 19 objects, while the language models were learnt from broad knowledge (See Figure 5).",
        "Another possibility is that verbs used for describing actions in images are more specific than verbs used in language.",
        "For example, in language one would ?use the car?, while in images such action would be labelled ?drive a car?.",
        "If we look at the performance of the language models, TypeDM performs best by a significant margin.",
        "This makes sense, as the most powerful term for predicting an action is obviously P (V |O), and we saw earlier that TypeDM produces probabilities P (V |O) which are closest to the image model.",
        "For the same reason, the second and third best language model are the Window2 and Window20 models, although their performance is significantly lower when using the predictions for objects and/or scenes.",
        "This is somewhat surprising considering that TypeDM, Window2 and Window20 are all very close in distance to the image model.",
        "Of course,",
        "action recognition using different settings: Ogs, Orec use only objects (gold standard and object recognizer); Sgs, Srec use only scenes,OgsSgs andOrecSrec integrate both objects and scenes together the distance is just an indication.",
        "R-LDA performs poorly because it is much more contextual.",
        "Finally, ConceptNet performs the worst.",
        "Another observation is that using the scene identity should theoretically help in human action recognition: Using TypeDM, the use of the gold standard object identity yields an average ranking over all images of 16.1, while using both the scene and object identity yields an average ranking of 10.2, which is significantly better.",
        "It means that the use of the scene can disambiguate some actions (e.g. ?ride a horse?",
        "vs. ?feed a horse?).",
        "However, when using the recognition system, using the scene does not increase the overall performance.",
        "This shows that the",
        "visual recognition system may not be strong enough for recognizing these 15 scenes.",
        "Another problem may be the limitation of 15 scenes only: while annotating we frequently found that it was hard for numerous images to put them into one of the 15 scenes.",
        "So a bigger scene database may help.",
        "The main problem with most available annotated human action datasets is that they are very restricted and domain-specific.",
        "For example, in this dataset with 19 objects and 15 scenes, there are many photos of a person riding a motorbike on rocky mountains as a kind of sport.",
        "Consequently, the probability of ?riding?",
        "given ?mountain?",
        "learnt from the image dataset is high according to the image data (78%) but is uncommon in general.",
        "So the image dataset might be too restricted or biased for general knowledge to work well.",
        "In the next section we therefore use a more general dataset.",
        "For every object in every image in the test set of the SUN database, we guess the identity of an object given the identity of all other objects in the image.",
        "In total, there are 78,306 object predictions within 10,652 images.",
        "As shown in Figure 7, the R-LDA model outperforms all other models for both average rank over images and over objects.",
        "Interestingly, both R-LDA and TypeDM are better at predicting the correct objects in images than the model learnt from the image training set itself.",
        "It shows that for many cases, the relation statistics learnt from language data can help in visual recognition.",
        "These language models are even better than the information extracted from general, relatively unbiased image datasets, where annotation is limited.",
        "For the limited annotation, this hypothesis is further supported by looking at the average rank over objects, which gives more weight to rarely occurring objects.",
        "As seen in Figure 7, all language models except ConceptNet outperform the image model.",
        "We conclude that language models",
        "different language models and ID (image data) can aid visual models in large-scale visual recognition problems which use co-occurrence of objects as their context, especially when the annotation is limited, as is often the case."

        "We have evaluated the performance of the language models in two visual scenarios: human action recognition and object prediction.",
