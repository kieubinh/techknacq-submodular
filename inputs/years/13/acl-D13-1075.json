        "When we read a text, our gaze does not move smoothly and continuously along its lines.",
        "Rather, our eyes fixate at a word, then skip a few words, to jump to a new fixation point.",
        "Such rapid eye movements are called saccades.",
        "Sometimes we even jump backwards.",
        "Backward saccades are called regressions.",
        "Gaze can be recorded using eye tracking devices (Starr and Rayner, 2001).",
        "Since eye movements in reading give us important information about what readers find complicated in a text, and what readers find completely predictable, predicting eye movements on new texts has many practical applications in text-to-text generation and human computer interaction, for example.",

        ", wn}, i.e., the fixation points of ri's gaze.",
        "For each token wj , the reader ri may skip wj or fixate at wj .",
        "Models are evaluated on recordings of human reading obtained using eye tracking devices.",
        "The supervised prediction problem that we consider in this paper, also uses eye tracking data for learning models of eye movement.",
        "Nilsson and Nivre (2009) first introduced this supervised learning task and used the Dundee corpus to train and evaluate a tree-based model, essentially treating the problem of predicting eye movements in reading as transition-based dependency parsing.",
        "We follow Hara et al. (2012) in modeling only forward saccades and not regressions and refix-ations.",
        "While Nilsson and Nivre (2009) try to model a subset of regressions and refixations, they do not evaluate this part of their model focusing only on fixation accuracy and distribution accuracy, i.e., they evaluate how well they predict a set of fixation points rather than a sequence of points in order.",
        "This enables us to model eye movements in reading as a sequential problem of determining the length of forward saccades, increasing the inductive bias of our learning algorithm in a motivated way.",
        "Note that because we work with visual input, we do not tokenize our input in our experiments, i.e., punctuation does not count as input tokens.",
        "Example Figure 1 presents an example sentence and gaze records from the Dundee corpus.",
        "The Dundee corpus contains gaze records of 10 readers in total.",
        "Note that there is little consensus on what words are skipped.",
        "5/10 readers skip the first word.",
        "Generally, closed class items (prepositions, copulae, quantifiers) seem to be skipped more open, but we do see a lot of individual variation.",
        "While others for this reason have refrained from evaluation across readers (Nilsson and Nivre, 2009; Hara et al., 2012),",
        "we show that our model predicts gaze better across readers than a previously proposed model (Nilsson and Nivre, 2009) does training and evaluating on the same readers.",
        "A final observation is that fixations are very frequent at the word level ?",
        "in fact, even skilled readers make 94 fixations per 100 words (Starr and Rayner, 2001) ?",
        "which motivates using F1-score of skips as metric.",
        "We follow Nilsson and Nivre (2009) in reporting word-level accuracy, but find it particularly interesting that the simple model proposed here outperforms previous models by a large margin in F1-score over skips.",
        "Related work Below we use a sequential model rather than a tree-based model to bias our model toward predicting forward saccades.",
        "Nilsson and Nivre (2009), in contrast, present a more expressive tree-based model for modeling eye movements, with some constraints on the search space.",
        "The transition-based model uses consecutive classification rather than structured prediction.",
        "The features used in their model are very simple.",
        "In particular, they use use word lengths and frequencies, like us, as well as distances between tokens (important in a transition-based model), and, finally, the history of previous decisions.",
        "Hara et al. (2012) use a linear CRF model for the same problem, like us, but they consider a slightly different problem, namely that of predicting eye movement when reading text on a specific screen.",
        "They therefore use screen position as a feature.",
        "In addition, they use word forms, POS, various measures of surprise of word length, as well as perplexity of bi-and trigrams.",
        "The features relating to screen position were the most predictive ones."
