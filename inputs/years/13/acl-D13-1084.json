      "text": [
        "There are more multilingual speakers in the world than monolingual speakers (Auer and Wei, 2007).",
        "Multilingual speakers switch across languages in daily communication (Auer, 1999).",
        "With the increasing use of social media, multilingual speakers also communicate with each other in online environments (Paolillo, 2011).",
        "Data from such resources can be used to study code switching patterns and language preferences in online multilingual conversations.",
        "Although most studies on multilingual online communication rely on manual identification of languages in relatively small datasets (Danet and Herring, 2007; Androutsopoulos, 2007), there is a growing demand for automatic language identification in larger datasets.",
        "Such a system would also be useful for selecting the right parsers to process multilingual documents and to build language resources for minority languages (King and Abney, 2013).",
        "In this paper, we identify Dutch (NL) en Turkish (TR) at the word level in a large online forum for Turkish-Dutch speakers living in the Netherlands.",
        "The users in the forum frequently switch languages within posts, for example: <TR> Sariyi ver </TR> <NL> Wel mooi doelpunt </NL> So far, language identification has mostly been mod-eled as a document classification problem.",
        "Most approaches rely on character or byte n-grams, by comparing n-gram profiles (Cavnar and Trenkle, 1994), or using various machine learning classifiers.",
        "While McNamee (2005) argues that language identification is a solved problem, classification on a more fine-grained level (instead of document level) remains a challenge (Hughes et al., 2006).",
        "Furthermore, language identification is more difficult for short texts (Baldwin and Lui, 2010; Vatanen et al., 2010), such as queries and tweets (Bergsma et al., 2012; Carter et al., 2012; Ceylan and Kim, 2009).",
        "Tagging individual words (without context) has been done using dictionaries, affix statistics and classifiers using character n-grams (Hammarstro?m, 2007; Got-tron and Lipka, 2010).",
        "Although Yamaguchi and Tanaka-Ishii (2012) segmented text by language, their data was artificially created by randomly sampling and concatenating text segments (40-160 characters) from monolingual texts.",
        "Therefore, the language switches do not reflect realistic switches as they occur in natural texts.",
        "Most related to ours is the work by King and Abney (2013) who labeled languages of words in multilingual web pages, but evaluated the task only using word level accuracy.",
        "Our paper makes the following contributions: 1) We explore two new ways to evaluate the task for an-alyzing multilingual communication and show that only word accuracy gives a limited view 2) We are the first to apply this task on a conversational and larger dataset 3) We show that features using the context improve the performance 4) We present a new public dataset to support research on language identification.",
        "In the rest of the paper, we first discuss the related work and describe our dataset.",
        "Secondly, we present our experiments.",
        "We finally conclude with a summary and suggestions for future work."
