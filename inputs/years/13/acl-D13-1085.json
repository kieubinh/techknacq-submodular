        "Microblogging services (e.g. Twitter) are attracting millions of users to share and exchange their ideas and opinions.",
        "Millions of new microblog posts are generated on such open broadcasting platforms every day 1.",
        "Microblog provides a fruitful and instant channel of global information publication and acquisition.",
        "A necessary step for the information acquisition on microblog is to identify which entities a post is about.",
        "Such identification can be challenging because the entity mention may be ambiguous.",
        "Let's begin with a real post from Twitter.",
        "per-day.html.",
        "This post is about an Australia political leader, Tony Abbot, and his opinion on flood tax policy.",
        "To understand that this post mentions Tony Abbot is not trivial because the name Abbot can refer to many people and organizations.",
        "In the Wikipedia page of Abbott, there lists more than 20 Abbotts, such as baseball player Jim Abbott, actor Bud Abbott and company Abbott Laboratories, etc..",
        "Given a knowledge base (KB) (e.g. Wikipedia), entity linking is the task to identify the referent KB entity of a target name mention in plain text.",
        "Most current entity linking techniques are designed for long text such as news/blog articles (Mihalcea and Csomai, 2007; Cucerzan, 2007; Milne and Witten, 2008; Han and Sun, 2011; Zhang et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2012; Kulkarni et al., 2009; Ratinov et al., 2011).",
        "Entity linking for microblog posts has not been well studied.",
        "Comparing with news/blog articles, microblog posts are: short each post contains no more than 140 characters; fresh the new entity-related content may have not been included in the knowledge base; informal acronyms and spoken language writing style are common.",
        "Due to these properties, few feature can be extracted from a post.",
        "Without enough features, previous entity linking methods may fail.",
        "In order to overcome the feature sparseness, we turn to another property of microblog:",
        "redundancy For each day, over 340M short messages are posted in twitter.",
        "Similar information may be posted in different expressions.",
        "For example, we find the following post, (2) Julia Gillard and Tony Abbott on the flood levy just after 8.30am on @612brisbane!",
        "The content of post (2) is highly related to post (1).",
        "In contrast to the confusing post (1), the text in post (2) explicitly indicates that the Abbott here refers to the Australian political leader.",
        "This inspires us to bridge the confusing post and the knowledge base with other posts.",
        "In this paper, we approach the microblog entity linking by leveraging extra posts.",
        "A straightforward method is to expand the post context with similar posts, which we call Context-Expansion-based Microblog Entity Linking (CEMEL).",
        "In this method, we first construct a query with the given post and then search for it in a collection of posts.",
        "From the search result, we select the most similar posts for the context expansion.",
        "The disambiguation will benefit from the extra posts if, hopefully, they are related to the given post in content and include explicit features for the disambiguation.",
        "Furthermore, we propose a Graph-based Microblog Entity Linking (GMEL) method.",
        "In contrast to CEMEL, the extra posts in GMEL are not directly added into the context.",
        "Instead, they are represented as nodes in a graph, and weighted by their similarity with the target post.",
        "We use an iterative algorithm in this graph to propagate the entity weights through the edges between the post nodes.",
        "We conduct experiments on real microblog data which we harvested from Twitter.",
        "Current entity linking corpus, such as the TAC-KBP data (M-cNamee and Dang, 2009), mainly focuses on long text.",
        "And few microblog entity linking corpus is publicly available.",
        "In this work, we manually annotated a microblog entity linking corpus.",
        "This corpus inherit the target names from TAC-KBP2009.",
        "So it is comparable with the TAC-KBP2009 corpus.",
        "Experimental results show that the performance of previous methods drops on microblog posts comparing with on long text.",
        "Both of CEMEL and GMEL can significantly improve the performance over baselines, which means that entity linking system on microblog can be improved by leveraging extra posts.",

        "Both of them have achieved the state-of-the-art performances in the TAC-KBP evaluations.",
        "The major challenge in microblog entity linking is the lack of context in the post.",
        "An ideal solution is to expand the context with the posts which contain the same entity.",
        "However, automatically judging whether a name mention in two documents refers to the same entity, namely cross document co-reference, is not trivial.",
        "Here our solution is to rank the posts by their possibility of co-reference to the target one and select the most possible co-referent posts for the expansion.",
        "CEMEL is based on the assumption that, given a name and two posts where the name is mentioned, the higher similarity between the posts the higher possibility of their co-reference and that the co-referent posts may contains useful features for the disambiguation.",
        "However, two literally similar posts may not be co-referent.",

        "In this mean, the expanded context in post (3) could mislead the disambiguation for post (1).",
        "Such noise can be controlled by setting a strict number of posts to expand the context or weighting the contribution of this post to the target one.",
        "Our CEMEL method consists of the following steps: First we construct a query with the terms from the target post.",
        "Second we search for the query in a microblog post collection using a common information retrieval model such as the vector space model.",
        "Note that here we limit the searched posts must contain the target name mention.",
