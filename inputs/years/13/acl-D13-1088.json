        "Much as with other work on pronunciation prediction, previous work on stress assignment has fallen into two camps, namely systems based on linguistically motivated rules (Church, 1985, for example) and more recently data-driven techniques where the models are derived directly from labeled training data (Dou et al., 2009).",

        "According to Halle (1997), considering just nouns, 91.6% are accented (on the stem), 6.6% are postaccented and 0.8% are unaccented, with about 1.0% falling into other patterns.",
        "Stress placement in Russian is important for speech applications since over and above the phonetic effects of stress itself (prominence, duration, etc.",
        "), the position of stress strongly influences vowel quality.",
