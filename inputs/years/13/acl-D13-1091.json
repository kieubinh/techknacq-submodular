        "Measuring semantic similarity for words and short texts has long been a fundamental problem for many applications such as word sense disambiguation, query expansion, search advertising and so on.",
        "Determining the word's polarity plays a critical role in opinion mining and sentiment analysis task.",
        "Usually we can detect the word's polarity by measuring it's semantic similarity with a positive seed word sep and a negative seed word sen respectively, as shown in Formula (1): SO(w) = sim(w, sep)?",
        "sim(w, sen) (1) where sim(wi, wj) is the semantic similarity measurement method for the given word wi and wj .",
        "A lot of papers have been published for designing appropriate similarity measurements.",
        "One direction is to learn similarity from the knowledge base or concept taxonomy (Lin, 1998; Resnik, 1999).",
        "Another direction is to learn semantic similarity with the help of large corpus such as Web or Wikipedia data (Sahami and Heilman, 2006; Yih and Meek, 2007; Bollegala et al., 2011; Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007).",
        "The basic assumption of this kind of methods is that the word with similar semantic meanings often co-occur in the given corpus.",
        "Extensive experiments have validated the effectiveness of the corpus-based method in polarity classification task (Turney, 2002; Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2007; Velikovich et al., 2010).",
        "For example, PMI is a well-known similarity measurement (Turney, 2002), which makes use of the whole Web as the corpus, and utilizes the search engine hits number to estimate the co-occurrence probability of the give word pairs.",
        "The PMI based method has achieved promising results.",
        "However, according to Kanayama's investigation, only 60% co-occurrences in the same window in Web pages reflect the same sentiment orientation (Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006).",
        "Therefore, we may ask the question whether the choosing of corpus can change the performance of sim and is there any better corpus than the Web page data for measuring the sentiment similarity?",
        "Everyday, enormous numbers of tweets that contain people's rich sentiments are published in Twitter.",
