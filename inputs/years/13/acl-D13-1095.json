        "Many previous studies (Imamura et al., 2009; Sasano et al., 2008; Sasano and Kurohashi, 2011) have treated only zero endophora, which is a phenomenon that a referent is mentioned in a document, such as ?????",
        "(pasta) in example (1).",
        "However, zero exophora, which is a phenomenon that a referent does not appear in a document, often occurs in Japanese when a referent is an author or reader of a document or an indefinite pronoun.",
