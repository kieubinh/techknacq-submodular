        "Various types of writers, such as novelists, journalists, movie script writers, and creatives in advertising, continue creating novel phrases and expressions that are original while befitting in expressing the desired meaning in the given situation.",

        "Metaphors in particular, one of the quintessential forms of linguistic creativity, have been discussed extensively by studies across multiple disciplines, e.g., Cognitive Science, Psychology, Linguistics, and Literature (e.g., Lakoff and Johnson (1980), McCurry and Hayes (1992), Goatly (1997)).",
        "Moreover, recent studies based on fMRI begin to discover biological evidences that support the impact of creative phrases on people's minds.",
        "These studies report that unconventional metaphoric expressions elicit significantly increased involvement of brain processing when compared against the effect of conventional metaphors or literal expressions (e.g., Mashal et al. (2007), Mashal et al. (2009)).",

        "However, their underlying mechanisms by and large are yet to be investigated.",
        "In this paper, as a small step toward quantitative understanding of linguistic creativity, we present a focused study on lexical composition two content words.",
        "Being creative, by definition, implies qualities such as being unique, novel, unfamiliar or unconventional.",

        "For example, unfa",
        "miliar biomedical terms, e.g., ?cardiac glycosides?, are only informative without appreciable creativity.",
        "Similarly, less frequent combinations of words, e.g., ?rotten detergent?",
        "or ?quiet teenager?, though describing situations that are certainly uncommon, do not bring about the sense of creativity.",
        "Finally, some unique combinations of words can be just nonsensical , e.g., ?elegant glycosides?.",
        "Different studies assumed different definitions of linguistic creativity depending on their context and end goals (e.g., Chomsky (1976), Zhu et al. (2009), Gerva's (2010), Maybin and Swann (2007), Carter and McCarthy (2004)).",

        "Such a system can also be integrated into automatic assessment of writing styles and quality, and utilized to automatically construct a collection of interesting expressions from the web, which may be potentially useful for enriching natural language generation systems.",
