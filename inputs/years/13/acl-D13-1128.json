        "Humans are readily able to produce a description of an image that correctly identifies the objects and actions depicted.",
        "Automating this process is useful for applications such as image retrieval, where users can go beyond keyword-search to describe their information needs, caption generation for improving the accessibility of existing image collections, story illustration, and in assistive technology for blind and partially sighted people.",
        "Automatic image description presents challenges on a number of levels: recognizing the objects in an image and their attributes are difficult computer vision problems; while determining how the objects interact, which relationships hold between them, and which events are depicted requires considerable background knowledge.",
        "Previous approaches to automatic description generation have typically tackled the problem using an object recognition system in conjunction with a natural language generation component based on language models or templates (Kulkarni et al., 2011; Li et al., 2011).",
        "Some approaches have utilised the visual attributes of objects (Farhadi et al., 2010), generated descriptions by retrieving the descriptions of similar images (Ordonez et al., 2011; Kuznetsova et al., 2012), relied on an external corpus to predict the relationships between objects (Yang et al., 2011), or combined sentence fragments using a tree-substitution grammar (Mitchell et al., 2012).",
        "A common aspect of existing work is that an image is represented as a bag of image regions.",
        "Bags of regions encode which objects co-occur in an image, but they are unable to express how the regions relate to each other, which makes it hard to describe what is happening.",
        "As an example, consider Figure 1a, which depicts a man riding a bike.",
        "If the man was instead repairing the bike, then the bag-of-regions representation would be the same, even though the image would depict a different action and would have to be described differently.",
        "This type of co-occurrence of regions indicates the need for a more structured image representation; an image description system that has access to structured repre",
        "scription; (c) visual dependency representation expressing the relationships between MAN, BIKE, and ROAD aligned to the syntactic dependency parse of the first sentence in the human-generated description (b).",
        "sentations would be able to correctly infer the action that is taking place, such as the distinction between repairing or riding a bike, which would greatly improve the descriptions it is able to generate.",
        "In this paper, we introduce visual dependency representations (VDRs) to represent the structure of images.",
        "This representation encodes the geometric relations between the regions of an image.",
        "An example can be found in Figure 1c, which depicts the VDR for Figure 1a.",
        "It encodes that the MAN is above the BIKE, and that the BIKE is on the ROAD.",
        "These relationships make it possible to infer that the man is riding a bike down the road, which corresponds to the first sentence of the human-generated image description in Figure 1b.",
        "In order to test the hypothesis that structured image representations are useful for description generation, we present a series of template-based image description models.",
        "Two of these models are based on approaches in the literature that represent images as bags of regions.",
        "The other two models use visual dependency representations, either on their own or in conjunction with gold-standard image descriptions at training time.",
        "We find that descriptions generated using the VDR-based models are significantly better than those generated using bag-of-region models in automatic evaluations using smoothed BLEU scores and in human judgements.",
        "The BLEU score improvements are found at bi-, tri-, and four-gram levels, and humans rate VDR-based image descriptions 1.2 points above the next-best model on a 1?5 scale.",
        "Finally, we also show that the benefit of the visual dependency representation is maintained when image descriptions are generated from automatically parsed VDRs.",
        "We use a modified version of the edge-factored parser of McDonald et al. (2005) to predict VDRs over a set of annotated object regions.",
        "This result reaffirms the potential utility of this representation as a means to describe events in images.",
        "Note that throughout the paper, we work with gold-standard region annotations; this makes it possible to explore the effect of structured image representations independently of automatic object detection."
