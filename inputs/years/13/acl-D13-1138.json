        "Data sparsity is one of the major problems for statistical learning methods in natural language processing (NLP) today.",
        "Even with the huge training data sets available in some tasks, for many phenomena that need to be modeled only few training instances can be observed.",
        "This is partly due to the large vocabularies of natural languages.",
        "One possiblity to reduce the sparsity for model estimation is to reduce the vocabulary size.",
        "By clustering the vocabulary into a fixed number of word classes, it is possible to train models that are less prone to sparsity issues.",
        "This work investigates the performance of standard models used in statistical machine translation when they are trained on automatically learned word classes rather than the actual word identities.",
        "In the popular tooklit GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), word classes are an essential ingredient to model alignment probabilities with the HMM or IBM translation models.",
        "It contains the mkcls tool (Och, 1999), which can automatically cluster the vocabulary into classes.",
        "Using this tool, we propose to re-parameterize the standard models used in statistical machine translation (SMT), which are usually conditioned on word identities rather than word classes.",
        "The idea is that this should lead to a smoother distribution, which is more reliable due to less sparsity.",
        "Here, we focus on the phrase-based and lexical channel models in both directions, simple count models identifying frequency thresholds, lexicalized reordering models and an n-gram language model.",
        "Although our results show that it is not a good idea to replace the original models, we argue that adding them to the log-linear feature combination can improve translation quality.",
        "They can easily be computed for different translation paradigms and arbitrary models.",
        "Training and decoding is possible without or with only little change to the code base.",
        "Our experiments are conducted on a medium-sized French?German task and a small German?English task and with both phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based translation decoders.",
        "By using word class models, we can improve our respective baselines by 1.4% BLEU and 1.0% TER on the French?German task and 0.3% BLEU and 1.1% TER on the German?English task.",
        "Training an additional language model for trans",
        "lation based on word classes has been proposed in (Wuebker et al., 2012; Mediani et al., 2012; Koehn and Hoang, 2007).",
        "In addition to the reduced sparsity, an advantage of the smaller vocabulary is that longer n-gram context can be modeled efficiently.",
        "Mathematically, our idea is equivalent to a special case of the Factored Translation Models proposed by Koehn and Hoang (2007).",
        "We will go into more detail in Section 4.",
        "Also related to our work, Cherry (2013) proposes to parameterize a hierarchical reordering model with sparse features that are conditioned on word classes trained with mkcls.",
        "However, the features are trained with MIRA rather than estimated by relative frequencies."
