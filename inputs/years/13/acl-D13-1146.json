        "Tokenization, the task of segmenting a text into words and sentences, is often regarded as a solved problem in natural language processing (Dridan and Oepen, 2012), probably because many corpora are already in tokenized format.",
        "But like an elephant in the living room, it is a problem that is impossible to overlook whenever new raw datasets need to be processed or when tokenization conventions are reconsidered.",
        "It is moreover an important problem, because any errors occurring early in the NLP pipeline affect further analysis negatively.",
        "And even though current tokenizers reach high performance, there are three issues that we feel haven't been addressed satisfactorily so far: ?",
        "Most tokenizers are rule-based and therefore hard to maintain and hard to adapt to new domains and new languages (Silla Jr. and Kaestner, 2004); ?",
        "Word and sentence segmentation are often seen as separate tasks, but they obviously inform each other and it could be advantageous to view them as a combined task; ?",
        "Most tokenization methods provide no alignment between raw and tokenized text, which makes mapping the tokenized version back onto the actual source hard or impossible.",
        "In short, we believe that regarding tokenization, there is still room for improvement, in particular on the methodological side of the task.",
        "We are particularly interested in the following questions: Can we use supervised learning to avoid hand-crafting rules?",
        "Can we use unsupervised feature learning to reduce feature engineering effort and boost performance?",
        "Can we use the same method across languages?",

        "A similar system was proposed earlier by Mikheev (2002).",

        "Closest to our work are approaches that present token and sentence splitters using conditional random fields (Tomanek et al., 2007; Fares et al., 2013).",
        "However, these previous approaches consider tokens (i.e. character sequences) as basic units for labeling, whereas we consider single characters.",
