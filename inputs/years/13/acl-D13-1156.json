        "Extractive summarization casts the summarization task as a sentence selection problem: identifying important summary sentences from one or multiple documents.",
        "Many methods have been developed in the past decades, including supervised approaches that use classifiers to predict summary sentences, graph based approaches to rank the sentences, and recent global optimization methods such as integer linear programming (Gillick et al., 2008) (ILP) and submodular maximization methods (Lin and Bilmes, 2011).",
        "Though extractive summarization is popular because of its simplicity and high readability, it has limitations in that it selects each sentence as a whole, and thus may miss informative partial sentences.",
        "To improve the informativeness, joint compression and summarization was proposed (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011), which uses words as summarization units, unlike extractive summarization where each sentence is a basic undecomposable unit.",
        "To achieve better readability, manually defined grammar constraints or automatically learned models based on syntax trees are added during the summarization process.",
        "Up to now, the state of the art compressive systems are based on integer linear programming (ILP).",
        "Because ILP suffers from exponential complexity, word-based compression summarization is an order of magnitude slower than sentence-based extraction.",
        "One common way to solve an ILP problem is to use its LP relaxation and round the results.",
        "However Berg-Kirkpatrick et al. (2011) found that LP relaxation gave poor results, finding unacceptably suboptimal solutions.",

        "Despite their empirical success, such",
        "a pruning approach has its inherent problem in that it may eliminate correct sentences in the first step.",
        "Recently, Almeida and Martins (2013) proposed a fast joint decoding algorithm based on dual decomposition.",
        "For fast convergence, they added quadratic penalty terms to alleviate the learning rate problem.",
        "In this paper, we propose an efficient decoding algorithm for fast ILP based compressive summarization using graph cuts.",
        "Our assumption is that all concepts are word n-grams and non-negatively scored.",
        "The rationale for the non-negativity assumption is straightforward: the score of a concept reflects its informativeness, hence should be non-negative.",
        "Given a set of documents, each word is associated with a binary variable, indicating whether the word is selected in the summary.",
        "Our idea is to approximate the ILP as a binary quadratic programming problem where coefficients of all quadratic terms are non-negative.",
        "It is well known that such binary quadratic function is supermodular, and its maximum can be solved efficiently using graph max-flow/min-cut.",
        "Hence the key is to find the coefficients of the super-modular binary quadratic function (SBQF) so that its maximum is close to the optimal ILP objective function.",
        "Our solution consists of 3 steps.",
        "First, we show that the subtree deletion model and grammar constraints can be eliminated by adding SBQFs to the objective function.",
        "Second, we relax the summary length constraint using Lagrangian relaxation.",
        "Third, we propose a family of SBQFs that are lower bounds of the ILP objective function.",
        "Since finding the tightest lower bound suffers from local optimality, we choose to use convex relaxation for initialization.",
        "To demonstrate our technique, we conduct experiments on Text Analysis Conference (TAC) datasets using the same train/test splits as previous work (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011).",
        "We compare our approach with the state-of-the-art ILP based approach in terms of summary quality (ROUGE scores and sentence quality) and speed.",
