        "The IBM translation models (Brown et al., 1993) have been tremendously important in statistical machine translation (SMT).",
        "The IBM models were the first generation of SMT systems; in recent work, they play a central role in deriving alignments used within many modern SMT approaches, for example phrase-based translation models (Koehn, 2008) and syntax-based translation systems (e.g., (Chiang, 2005; Marcu et al., 2006)).",
        "Since the original IBM paper, there has been a large amount of research exploring the original IBM models and modern variants (e.g., (Moore, 2004; Liang et al., 2006; Toutanova and Galley, 2011; Riley and Gildea, 2012; Vogel et al., 1996)).",
        "Excluding IBM Model 1, the IBM translation models, and practically all variants proposed in the literature, have relied on the optimization of likelihood functions or similar functions that are non-convex.",
        "Unfortunately, non-convex objective functions have multiple local optima, and finding a global optimum of a non-convex function is typically a computationally intractible problem.",
        "Typically, an EM algorithm is used, which often runs in a reasonable amount of time, but with no guarantees of finding a global optima (or for that matter, even a near-optimal solution).",
        "In this paper we make the following contributions: ?",
        "We introduce a convex relaxation of IBM Model 2.",
        "At a very high level, the relaxation is derived by replacing the product t(fj |ei) ?",
        "d(i|j) with a relaxation that is commonly used in the linear programming literature (e.g., see (Bertsimas, 1997; Bertsimas and Tsitsiklis, 1997; Martins et al., 2010)).",
        "(Here t(f |e) are the translation parameters of the model, and d(i|j) are the distortion parameters; the product is non-linear, effectively introducing non-convexity into the problem.)",
        "?",
        "We describe an optimization algorithm for the relaxed objective, based on a combination of stochastic subgradient methods with the exponentiated-gradient (EG) algorithm (Kivi-nen and Warmuth, 1997; Beck and Teboulle, 2003).",
        "?",
        "We describe experiments with the method on standard alignment datasets, showing that the EG algorithm converges in only a few passes over the data, and that our method achieves accuracies that are very similar to those of IBM Model 2.",
        "Framing the unsupervised learning of alignment models as a convex optimization problem, with guaranteed convergence to a global optimum, has several clear advantages.",
        "First, the method is easier to analyze, as the objective function is being truly maximized.",
        "Second, there is no need for initialization heuristics with the approach, given that the method will always converge to a global optimum.",
        "Finally, we expect that our convexity-based approach may facilitate the further development of more convex models.",
        "There has been a rich",
        "interplay between convex and non-convex methods in machine learning: as one example consider the literature on classification problems, with early work on the perceptron (linear/convex), then work on neural networks with back-propagation (non-linear/non-convex), then the introduction of support vector machines (non-linear/convex), and finally recent work on deep belief networks (non-linear/nonconvex).",
        "In view of these developments, the lack of convex methods in translation alignment models has been noticeable, and we hope that our work will open up new directions and lead to further progress in this area.",
