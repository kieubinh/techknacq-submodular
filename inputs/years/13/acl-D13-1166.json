        "Distributional models of meaning have been proved extremely useful for a number of natural language processing tasks, ranging from thesaurus extraction (Curran, 2004) to topic modelling (Landauer and Dumais, 1997) and information retrieval (Manning et al., 2008), to name just a few.",
        "These models are based on the distributional hypothesis of Harris (1968), which states that the meaning of a word depends on its context.",
        "This idea allows the words to be represented by vectors of statistics collected from a sufficiently large corpus of text; each element of the vector reflects how many times a word co-occurs in the same context with another word of the vocabulary.",
        "However, due to the generative power of natural language, which is able to produce infinite new structures from a finite set of resources (words), no text corpus, regardless of its size, can provide reliable distributional representations for anything longer than single words or perhaps very short phrases consisting of two words; in other words, this technique cannot scale up to the phrase or sentence level.",
        "Much research activity has been recently dedicated to provide a solution to this problem: although the direct construction of a sentence vector is not possible, we might still be able to synthetically create such a vectorial representation by somehow composing the vectors of the words that comprise the sentence.",
        "Towards this goal, researchers have employed a variety of approaches that roughly fall into two general categories.",
        "Following an influential work (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008), the models in the first category compute a sentence vector as a mixture of the original word vectors, using simple operations such as element-wise multiplication and addition; we refer to these models as vector mixtures.",
        "The main characteristic of these models is that they do not distinguish between the type-logical identities of the different words: an intransitive verb, for example, is of the same order as its subject (a noun), and both will contribute equally to the composite sentence vector.",
        "However, this symmetric treatment of composition seems unjustified from a formal semantics point of view.",
        "Words with special meanings, such as verbs and adjectives, are usually seen as functions acting on, hence modifying, a number of arguments rather than lexical units of the same order as them; an adjective, for example, is a function that returns a modified version of its input noun.",
        "Inspired from",
        "this more-aligned-to-formal-semantics view, a second research direction aims to represent relational words as linear maps (tensors of various orders) that can be applied to one or more arguments (vectors).",
        "Baroni and Zamparelli (2010), for example, model adjectives as matrices which, when matrix-multiplied with a noun vector, will produce a vectorial representation of the specific adjective-noun compound.",
        "The notion of a framework where relational words are entities living in vector spaces of higher order than nouns, which are simple vectors, has been formalized by Coecke et al. (2010) in the context of the abstract mathematical framework of compact closed categories.",
        "We refer to this class of models as tensor-based.",
        "Regardless of the way they approach the representation of relational words and their composition operation, however, most current compositional-distributional models do share a common feature: they all rely on ambiguous vector representations, where all the senses of a polysemous word, such as the verb ?file?",
        "(which can mean register or smooth), are merged into the same vector or tensor.",
        "At least for the vector mixture approach, this practice has been proved suboptimal: Reddy et al. (2011) and Kartsaklis et al. (2013) test a number of simple multiplicative and additive models using disambiguated vector representations on various tasks, showing that the introduction of a disambiguation step prior to actual composition can indeed increase the quality of the composite vectors.",
        "However, the fact that disambiguation can be beneficial for models based on vector mixtures is not very surprising.",
        "Both additive and multiplicative compositions are but a kind of average of the vectors of the words in the sentence, hence can directly benefit from the provision of more accurate starting points.",
        "Perhaps a more interesting question, and one that the current paper aims to address, is to what extent disambiguation can also provide benefits for tensor-based approaches, which in general constitute more powerful models for natural language (see discussion in Section 2).",
        "Specifically, this paper aims to: (a) propose disambiguation algorithms for a number of tensor-based distributional models; (b) examine the effect of disambiguation on tensors for relational words; and (c) meaningfully compare the effectiveness of tensor-based against vector mixture models in a number of tasks.",
        "Based on the generic procedure of Schu?tze (1998), we propose algorithms for a number of tensor-based models, where the composition is modelled as the application of linear maps (tensor contractions).",
        "Following Mitchell and Lapata (2008) and many others, we test our models on two disambiguation tasks similar to that of Kintsch (2001), and on the phrase similarity task introduced in (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010).",
        "In almost every case, the results show that disambiguation can make a great difference in the case of tensor-based models; they also reconfirm previous findings regarding the effectiveness of the method for simple vector mixture models."

        "In the case of addition, the components of the output vector are simply the cumulative scores of the corresponding input components.",
        "So in a sense the output element embraces both input elements, resembling a union of the input features.",
        "On the other hand, the element-wise multiplication of two vectors can be seen as the intersection of their features: a zero element in one of the input vectors will eliminate the corresponding feature in the output, no matter how high the other input component was.",
        "In addition to failing to identify the special roles of words in a sentence, vector mixture models disregard grammar in another way: the commutativity of operators make them a bag-of-words approach, where the meaning of sentence ?dog bites man?",

        "lished until (Kartsaklis et al., 2013).",
        "in the first dataset many verbs cannot be considered as genuinely ambiguous (e.g. ?say?",

        "with meanings register and smooth or ?charge?",
        "with meanings accuse and bill).",
        "Furthermore, subjects and objects of this latter case are modified by appropriate adjectives, overall creating a richer and more linguistically balanced dataset.",

        "The context is combined with the verb and the two landmarks, creating three simple transitive sentences.",
        "The main-verb sentence is paired with both the landmark sentences, and these pairs are randomly presented to human evaluators, the duty of which is to evaluate the similarity of the sentences within a pair in a scale from 1 to 7.",

        "2 landmarks ?",
        "10 contexts).",
        "Results The results for the G&S dataset are shown in Table 1.5 The verbs-only model (BL) refers to a non-compositional evaluation, where the similarity between two sentences is solely based on the distance between the two verbs, without applying any compositional step with subject and object.",
        "The tensor-based models present much better performance than the vector mixture ones, with the disambiguated version of the copy-object model significantly higher than the relational model.",
        "By design, the copy-object model retains more information about the objects; so this result confirms previous findings, that in this certain dataset the role of objects is more important than that of subjects (Kartsaklis et al., 2012).",
        "In general, the disambiguation step improves the results of all the tensor-based models except Kronecker; the effect is reversed for the vector mixture models, where the disambiguated versions present much worse performance (these",
        "findings are further discussed in Section 9).",
        "The result of disambiguation is clearer for the dataset of Kartsaklis et al. (Table 2).",
        "The longer context in combination with genuinely ambiguous verbs produces two effects: first, disambiguation is now helpful for all models, either vector mixtures or tensor-based; second, the disambiguation of just the verb (verbs-only model), without any interaction with the context, is sufficient to provide the best score (0.22) with a difference statistically significant from the second model (0.19 for disambiguated additive).",
        "In fact, further composition of the verb with the context decreases performance, confirming the results reported by Kartsaklis et al. (2013) for vectors trained using BNC.",
        "Given the nature of the specific task, which is designed around the ambiguity of the verb, this result is not surprising: a direct disambiguation of the verb based on the rest of the context should naturally constitute the best method to achieve top performance?no composition is necessary for this task to be successful.",
        "However, when one does use a task like this in order to evaluate compositional models (as we do here and as is commonly the case), they implicitly correlate the strength of the disambiguation effect that takes place during the composition with the quality of composition, essentially assuming that the stronger the disambiguation, the better the compositional model that produced this side-effect.",
        "Unfortunately, the extent to which this assumption is valid or not is still not quite clear; the subject is addressed in more detail in (Kartsaklis et al., 2013).",

        "We work on the verb-phrase part of the dataset, consisting of 72 short verb phrases (verb-object structures).",
        "These 72 phrases have been paired in three different ways to form groups exhibiting various degrees of similarity: the first group contains 36 pairs of highly similar phrases (e.g. produce effect-achieve result), the pairs of the second group are of medium similarity (e.g. write book-hear word), while a last group contains low-similarity pairs (use knowledge-provide system).",
        "The task is again to compare the similarity scores given by the various models for each phrase pair with those of human annotators.",
        "Additionally to the verb phrases task, we also perform a richer version of the experiment using transitive sentences.",
        "Verb phrases It can be shown that for simple verb phrases the relational model reduces itself to the copy-subject model; for both of these methods, the meaning of the verb phrase is calculated according to Equation 6.",
        "Furthermore, according to the copy-object model the meaning of a verb phrase computed by a verb matrix",
        "Finally, the Kronecker model has no meaning for verb phrases, since the vector of a verb phrase",
        "obj?",
        "denotes the inner product between vectors of verb and object.",
        "Hence, the",
        "meaning of a verb phrase becomes a scalar multiplication of the meaning of its verb.",
        "As a result, the cosine distance (used for measuring similarity) between the meanings of two verb phrases is reduced to the distance between the vectors of their verbs, completely dismissing the role of their objects.",
        "Hence our models are limited to those of Table 3.",
        "The effects of disambiguation for this task are quite impressive: the differences between the scores of all disambiguated models and those of the ambiguous versions are highly statistically significant (with p < 0.001), while 4 of the 5 models present an improvement greater than 10 units of correlation.",
        "The models that benefit the most from disambiguation are the vector mixtures; both of these approaches perform significantly better than the best tensor-based model (copy-object).",
        "In fact, the score of M1 (0.45) is quite high, given that the inter-annotator agreement is 0.55 (best score reported by Mitchell and Lapata was 0.41 for their LDA-dilation model).",
        "Transitive sentences The second part of this experiment aims to examine the extent to which the above picture can change for the case of text structures longer than verb phrases.",
        "In order to achieve this, we extend each one of the 72 verb phrases to a full transitive sentence by adding an appropriate subject such that the similarity relationships of the original dataset are retained as much as possible, so the human judgements for the verb phrase pairs could as well be used for the transitive cases.",
        "We worked pair-wise: for each pair of verb phrases, we first selected one of the 5 most frequent subjects for the first phrase; then, the subject of the other phrase was selected by a list of synonyms of the first subject in a way that the new pair of transitive sentences constitutes the least more specific version of the given verb-phrase pair.",
        "So, for example, the pair produce effect/achieve result became drug produce effect/medication achieve result, while the pair pose problem/address question became study pose problem/paper address question.",
        "The restrictions of the verb-phrase version do not hold here, so we evaluate on the full set of models (Table 4).",
        "Once more disambiguation produces better results in all cases, with highly statistically significant differences for all but one model.",
        "Furthermore, now the best score is delivered by one of the tensor-based models (Kronecker), with a difference not statistically significant from disambiguated additive.",
        "In any case, the result suggests that as the length of the text segments increases, the performance of vector mixtures and tensor-based models converges.",

        "The purpose of this work was twofold: our main objective was to investigate how disambiguation can affect the compositional models which are based on higher order vector spaces; a second, but not less important goal, was to compare this more linguistically motivated approach to the simpler vector mixture methods.",
        "Based on the experimental work presented here, we can say with enough confidence that disambiguation as an additional step prior to composition is indeed very beneficial for tensor-based models.",
        "Furthermore, our experiments confirm and strengthen previous work (Reddy et al., 2011; Kartsaklis et al., 2013) that showed better performance of disambiguated vector mixture models compared to their ambiguous versions.",
        "The positive effect of disambiguation is more evident for the vector mixture models (especially for the additive model) than for",
        "the tensor-based ones.",
        "This is expected: composite representations created by element-wise operations are averages, and a prior step of disambiguation can make a great difference.",
        "From a task perspective, the effect of disambiguation was much more definite in the phrase/sentence similarity task.",
        "This observation is really interesting, since the words of that dataset were not selected in order to be ambiguous in any way.",
        "The superior performance of the disambiguated models, therefore, implies that the proposed methodology can improve tasks based on phrase or sentence similarity regardless of the level of ambiguity in the vocabulary.",
        "For these cases, the proposed disambiguation algorithm acts as a fine-tuning process, the outcome of which seems to be always positive; it can only produce better composite representations, not worse.",
        "In general, the positive effect of disambiguation in the phrase/sentence similarity task is quite encouraging, especially given the fact that this task constitutes a more appropriate test for evaluating compositional models, avoiding the pitfalls of disambiguation-based experiments (as shortly discussed in Section 8.1).",
        "For disambiguation-based tasks similar to those of Section 8.1, the form of dataset is very important; hence the inferior performance of disambiguated models in the G&S dataset, compared to the dataset of Kartsaklis et al.",
        "In fact, the G&S dataset was the only one where disambiguation was not helpful for some cases (specifically, for vector mixtures and the Kronecker model).",
        "We believe the reason behind this lies in the fact that the automatic selection of landmark verbs using the JCN metric (as done with the G&S dataset) was not very efficient for certain cases.",
        "Note, for example, that the bare baseline of comparing just ambiguous versions of verbs (without any composition) in that dataset aleady achieves a very high correlation of 0.198 with human judgements (Table 1).7.",
        "This number is only 0.15 for the Kartsaklis et al. dataset, due to the more efficient verb selection procedure.",
        "In general, we consider the results gained by this latter experiment more reliable for the specific task, the successful evaluation of which requires genuinely ambiguous verbs.",
        "The results are less conclusive for the second question we posed in the beginning of this section, regarding the comparison of the two classes of mod-7The reported number for this baseline by Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh (2011a) was 0.16 using vectors trained from BNC.",
        "els.",
        "Despite the obvious benefits of the tensor-based approaches, this work suggests for one more time that vector mixture models might constitute a hard-to-beat baseline; similar observations have been made, for example, in the comparative study of Bla-coe and Lapata (2012).",
        "However, when trying to interpret the mixing results regarding the effectiveness of the tensor-based models compared to vector mixtures, we need to take into account that the tensor-based models tested in this work were all ?hybrid?, in the sense that they all involved some element of point-wise operation; in other words, they constituted a trade-off between transformational power and complexity.",
        "Even with this compromise, though, the study presented in Section 8.2 implies that the effectiveness of each method depends to some extent on the length of the text segment: when more words are involved, vector mixture models tend to be less effective; on the contrary, the performance of tensor-based models seems to be proportional to the length of the phrase or sentence?the more, the better.",
        "These observations comply with the nature of the approaches: ?averaging?",
        "larger numbers of points results in more general (hence less accurate) representations; on the other hand, a larger number of arguments makes a function (such as a verb) more accurate."
