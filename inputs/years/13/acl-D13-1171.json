        "Sentiment analysis is a multifaceted problem.",
        "Determining when a positive or negative sentiment is being expressed is a large part of the challenge, but identifying other attributes, such as the target of the sentiment, is also crucial if the ultimate goal is to pinpoint and extract opinions.",
        "Consider the examples below, all of which contain a positive sentiment:",
        "(1) So happy that Kentucky lost to Tennessee!",
        "(2) Kentucky versus Kansas I can hardly wait... (3) Kentucky is the best alley-oop throwing team",
        "since Sherman Douglas?",
        "Syracuse squads!!",
        "The entities in these examples are college basketball teams, and the events referred to are games.",
        "In (1), although there is a positive sentiment, the target of the sentiment is an event (Kentucky losing to Tennessee).",
        "However, from the positive sentiment toward this event, we can infer that the speaker has a negative sentiment toward Kentucky and a positive sentiment toward Tennessee.",
        "In (2), the positive sentiment is toward a future event, but we are not given enough information to infer a sentiment toward the mentioned entities.",
        "In (3), Kentucky is the direct target of the positive sentiment.",
        "We can also infer a positive sentiment toward Douglas's Syracuse teams, and even toward Douglas himself.",
        "These examples illustrate the importance of the target when interpreting sentiment in context.",
        "If we are looking for sentiments toward Kentucky, for example, we would want to identify (1) as negative, (2) as neutral (no sentiment) and (3) as positive.",
        "However, if we are looking for sentiment toward Tennessee, we would want to identify (1) as positive, and (2) and (3) as neutral.",
        "The expression of these and other kinds of sentiment can be understood as involving three items:",
        "(1) An experiencer (2) An attitude (3) A target (optionally)",
        "Research in sentiment analysis often focuses on (2), predicting overall sentiment polarity (Agarwal et al., 2011; Bora, 2012).",
        "Recent work has begun to combine (2) with (3), examining how to automatically predict the sentiment polarity expressed towards a target entity (Jiang et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2012) for a fixed set of targets.",
        "This topic-dependent sentiment classification requires that the target entity be",
        "given, and returns statements expressing sentiment towards the given entity.",
        "In this paper, we take a step towards open-domain, targeted sentiment analysis by investigating how to detect both the named entity and the sentiment expressed toward it.",
        "We observe that sentiment expressed towards a target entity may be possible to learn in a graphical model along the span of the entity itself: Similar to how named entity recognition (NER) learns labels along the span of each word in an entity name, sentiment may be expressed along the entity as well.",
        "A small example is shown in Figure 1.",
        "We focus on people and organizations (volitional named entities), which are the primary targets of sentiment in our microblog data (see Table 1).",
        "Both NER and opinion expression extraction have achieved impressive results using conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) to define the conditional probability of entity categories (Mc-Callum and Li, 2003; Choi et al., 2006; Yang and Cardie, 2013).",
        "We develop such models to jointly predict the NE and the sentiment expressed towards it using minimum risk training (Stoyanov and Eis-ner, 2012).",
        "We learn our models on informal Spanish and English language taken from the social network Twitter,1 where the language variety makes NLP particularly challenging (see Figure 2).",
        "Our ultimate goal is to develop models that will be useful for low resource languages, where a sentiment lexicon may be known or bootstrapped, but more sophisticated linguistic tools may not be readily available.",
        "We therefore do not rely on an external part-of-speech tagger or parser, which are often used for features in fine-grained sentiment analysis; such tools are not available in many languages, and if they are, are not usually adapted for noisy social media.",

        "Efforts in targeted sentiment (Bermingham and Smeaton, 2010; Jin and Ho, 2009; Li et al., 2010a; Jiang et al., 2011; Tan et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2012), have mostly focused on topic-dependent analysis.",
        "In these approaches, messages are collected on a fixed set of topics/targets, such as products or sports teams, and sentiment is learned for the given set.",
        "In contrast, we aim to predict sentiment in tweets for any named person or organization.",
        "We refer to this task as open domain targeted sentiment analysis.",
        "Within topic-dependent sentiment analysis, several approaches have explored applying CRFs or HMMs to extract sentiment and target words from text (Jin and Ho, 2009; Li et al., 2010a).",
        "In these approaches, opinion expressions are extracted, and polarity is annotated across the opinion expression.",
        "However, as noted by many researchers in sentiment, opinion orientation towards a specific target is often not equal to the orientation of a neighbor-ing opinion expression; and opinion expressions in one context may not be opinion expressions in another (Kim and Hovy, 2006), making open domain approaches particularly challenging.",
        "The above work by Jiang et al. (2011) is most similar to our own.",
        "They do not use joint learning, but they do incorporate a number of parse-based features designed to capture relationships between sentiment terms and topic references.",
        "In our work these relationships are captured by the CRF model, and we compare against their approach in Section 6.",
        "Recent work by Yang and Cardie (2013) is similar in spirit to our own, where the identification of opinion holders, opinion targets, and opinion expressions is modeled as a sequence tagging problem using a CRF.",
        "However, similar to previous work applying CRFs to extract sentiment, Yang and Cardie use syntactic relations to connect an opinion target to an opinion expression.",
        "In contrast, we model the expression of sentiment polarity across the sentiment target itself, extracting both the sentiment target and the sentiment expressed towards it within the same span of words.",
        "This allows us to use surrounding context to determine sentiment polarity without identifying explicit opinion expressions or relying on a parser to help link expression to target.",
        "Most work in targeted sentiment outside the mi-croblogging domain has been in relation to product review mining (e.g., Yi et al. (2003), Hu and Liu (2004), Popescu and Etzioni (2005), Qiu et al. (2011)).",
        "Rather than identify named entities (NEs), this work seeks to identify products and their features mentioned in reviews, and classify these for sentiment.",
        "Recent work by Quiet al jointly learns targets and opinion words, and Jakob and Gurevych (2010) use CRFs to extract the targets of opinions, but do not attempt to classify the sentiment toward these targets.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to approach targeted sentiment in a low resource setting and to jointly predict NEs and targeted sentiment."
