        "Recall improvement suggests that modeling connectivity allowed Global to add correct relations in cases where some events were not connected to one another.",
        "The Local classifier substantially outperforms Localbase.",
        "This indicates that our novel features (Section 3.2) are important for discriminating between process relations.",
        "Specifically, in the full evaluation Local improves precision more than in the temporal evaluation, suggesting that designing syntactic and semantic features for connectives is useful for distinguishing PREV, CAUSES, and ENABLES when the amount of training data is small.",
        "The Chain baseline performs only slightly worse than our global model.",
        "This demonstrates the strong tendency of processes to proceed linearly from one event to the other, which is a known property of discourse structure (Schegloff and Sacks, 1973).",
        "However, since the structure is deterministically fixed, Chain is highly inflexible and does not allow any extensions or incorporation of other structural constraints or domain knowledge.",
        "Thus, it can be used as a simple and efficient approximation but is not a good candidate for a real system.",
