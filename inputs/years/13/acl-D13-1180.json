        "Automated essay scoring utilizes the NLP techniques to automatically rate essays written for given prompts, namely, essay topics, in an educational setting (Dikli, 2006).",
        "Nowadays, AES systems have been put into practical use in large-scale English tests and play the role of one human rater.",
        "For example, before AES systems enter the picture, essays in the writing assessment of Graduate Record Examination (GRE) are rated by two human raters.",
        "A third human rater is needed when the difference of the scores given by the two human raters is larger than one in the 6-point scale.",
        "Currently, GRE essays are rated by one human rater and one AES system.",
        "A second human rater is required only when there exists a non-negligible disagreement between the first human rater and the machine rater.",
        "With the help of an AES system that highly agrees with human raters, the human workload can be reduced by half at most.",
        "Therefore, the agreement between the AES system and the human rater is an important indicator of an AES system's effectiveness.",
        "There have been efforts in developing AES methods since the 1960s.",
        "Various kinds of algorithms and models based on NLP and machine learning techniques have been proposed to implement AES systems.",
        "Existing approaches consider essay rating as a classification (Larkey, 1998), regression (Attali and Burstein, 2006) or preference ranking problem (Yannakoudakis et al., 2011), where the loss function is the regression loss, classification loss and pairwise classification loss, respectively.",
        "In this paper, we argue that the purpose of AES is to predict the essay's rating that human raters would give.",
        "If an AES system frequently disagrees with the first human rater, a second human rater will be needed in most cases.",
        "Thus, the introduction of the AES system does not bring much benefit in reducing the human workload.",
        "It is therefore desirable to minimize the disagreement between the machine and human raters.",
        "However, this disagreement is not explicitly, if any, addressed in the current AES methods.",
        "To this end, we propose a rank-based approach in this paper that utilizes a listwise learning to rank",
        "algorithm to address automated essay scoring in the view of directly optimizing the agreement between human raters and the AES system.",
        "Different from the preference ranking-based approach (Yannakoudakis et al., 2011) that maximizes the pairwise classification precision (Liu, 2009), our rank-based approach follows the listwise learning paradigm and the agreement between the machine and human raters is directly integrated into the loss function that is optimized by gradient boost regression trees.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply listwise learning to rank approach for AES, which aims at the optimization of the agreement between the human and machine raters.",
        "Experimental results on the publicly available dataset ASAP indicate that our proposed method achieves high agreement with human raters, that is about 0.80, measured by quadratic weighted Kappa (Brenner and Kliebsch, 1996).",
        "Our proposed method also outperforms the previous classification, regression and preference ranking based approaches.",
        "As it is widely accepted that the agreement between human raters, measured by either quadratic weighted Kappa or Pearson's correlation coefficient, ranges from 0.70 to 0.80 (Powers et al., 2000) (Williamson, 2009), our proposed approach therefore performs as well as human raters.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In section 2, we introduce the research background of automated essay scoring and give a brief introduction to learning to rank.",
        "In section 3, a detailed description of our listwise learning to rank approach for automated essay scoring is presented.",
        "Section 4 explains the experimental setup and section 5 presents the experimental results.",
        "Finally, in section 6 we conclude this research."

        "Based on a large number of predefined objectively measurable features, various learning techniques, including classification, regression and preference ranking, are applied (Larkey, 1998) (Yannakoudakis et al., 2011).",
        "Regression-based approach treats feature values and essay score as independent variables and dependent variable, respectively, and then learns a regression equation by classical regression algorithms, such as support vector regression (Vapnik et al., 1996).",
        "In 1966, the first AES system, Project Essay Grader, was developed by Ellis Page upon the request of the American College Board.",
        "The PEG system defines a large set of surface text features from essays, e.g. fourth root of essay length, and uses regression-based approach to predict the score that human raters will give.",
        "E-rater, developed by Educational Testing Services (ETS) in America, in late 1990s, is a commercial AES system which has been put into practical use in the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL).",
        "The E-rater system uses natural language processing techniques to extract various kinds of linguistic features of essays, such as lexical, syntactic, grammar, etc.. Then it predicts the final score by the stepwise regression method (Attali and Burstein, 2006).",
        "The classification-based approach sees essay scores as in-discriminative class labels and uses classical classification algorithms, e.g. the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and the naive Bayesian model, to predict to which class an essay belongs, where a class is associated to a numeric rating.",
        "Intelligent Essay Assessor (IEA) (Foltz et al., 1999), developed also in late 1990s, evaluates essay by measuring semantic features.",
        "Each ungraded essay, represented by a semantic vector generated by Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Dumais, 2005), is rated according to the similarity degree with semantic vectors of graded essays.",
        "Bayesian Essay Test Scoring sYs-tem, developed by Larkey in 2003, is based on naive Bayesian model.",
        "It is the only open-source AES system, but has not been put into practical use yet.",
        "Besides classification and regression-based approaches, (Yannakoudakis et al., 2011) proposed a preference ranking based approach for learning a rating model, where a ranking function or model is learned to construct a global ordering of essays based on writing quality.",
        "It is also the first study of rank-based approach in automated essay scoring.",

        "is not mentioned in",
        "their paper, the algorithm they used, Ranking SVM (svm-light package with ?-z p?",
        "option), is actually a pairwise approach.",
        "We will give a brief introduction to learning to rank in section 2.2.",
        "The AES systems can be deployed in two different manners, namely prompt-specific and generic.",
        "A prompt-specific rating model is built for a specific prompt and designed to be the best rating model for the particular prompt (Williamson, 2009).",
        "For different prompts, the features used, their weights, and scoring criteria, may be different.",
        "It usually requires several hundreds of graded essays for training, which is time-consuming and usually impractical in a classroom environment.",
        "Generic rating model is trained from essays across a group of prompts and designed to be the best fit for predicting human scores for all prompts.",
        "It usually does not consider prompt-specific features and just takes writing quality into account.",
        "Generic rating model evaluates essays across all prompts with the same scoring criteria, which is more consistent with the human rubric that is usually the same for all prompts, and therefore has validity-related advantages (Attali et al., 2010)."

        "Most existing research on AES focus on training a prompt-specific rating model.",
        "While such approaches have the advantage of providing a satisfactory rating accuracy for essays written for a specific topic, they also suffer from validity and feasibility problem as a significant amount of training data, namely essays with human ratings, are required for every given essay topic (Attali et al., 2010).",
        "It is therefore appealing to develop an approach that learns a generic model with acceptable rating accuracy, since it has both validity-related and logistical advantages.",
        "In our future work, we plan to continue the research on generic rating model.",
        "Because of the diversification of writing features of essays associated with different prompts, a viable approach is to explore more generic writing features that can well reflect the writing quality."
