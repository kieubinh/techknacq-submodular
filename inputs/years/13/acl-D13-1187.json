        "We measure performance starting with features from LI , and then incrementally add emoticon features E and features from LB one part of speech at a time to show the contribution of each part of speech for sentiment classification.12 This experiment shows that there is a clear improvement for the models parameterized with gender, at least for the simple, rule-based model.",
        "For the supervised models we experiment with a variety of learners for English to show that gender differences in subjective language improve sentiment classification for many learning algorithms.",
        "We present the results in Figure 4c.",
        "For subjectivity classification, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB) and Bayesian Logistic Regression (BLR) achieve the best results, with improvements in F-measure ranging from 0.5 - 5%.",
