        "The last decade has shown a historical change in the way we consume products.",
        "People are getting used to receive recommendations.",
        "Nevertheless, after a few bad recommendations, users will not be convinced anymore by the RS.",
        "Moreover, if these suggestions come without explanations, why people should trust it?",
        "Numbers and figures cannot talk to people.",
        "To answer these key issues, we have designed a new semantic recommender sytem (SRS) including at least two innovative features: ?",
        "Argumentation: each recommendation relies on and comes along with a textual argumentation, providing the reasons that led to that recommendation.",
        "?",
        "Fast adaptation: the system is updated in a continuous way, as each new review is posted.",
        "In doing so, the system will be perceived as less intrusive thanks to well-chosen words and its failures will be smoothed over.",
        "It is therefore necessary to design a new generation of RS providing textually well-argued recommendations.",
        "This way, the end user will have more elements to make a well-informed choice.",
        "Moreover, the system parameters have to be dynamically and continuously updated, in order to provide recommendations and arguments in phase with the very recent past.",
        "To do so, we have adapted the algorithms we described in Gaillard (Gaillard et al., 2013), by including a semantic level, i.e words, terms and phrases as they are naturally expressed in reviews.",
        "This paper is structured as follows.",
