        "pre-processed ATB (Table 10).",
        "Consequently, this particular Arabic MWE identification experiment is similar to joint parsing and named entity recognition (NER) (Finkel and Manning 2009).",
        "The DP-TSG is effective at memorizing the entities and reusing them at test time.",

        "One explanation for this result could be the CC tag set, which was explicitly tuned for the Berkeley parser.",
        "The CC tag set improved Berkeley MWE identification accuracy by 1.8% F1 and basic parsing accuracy by 1.2% F1 over the previous version of our work (Green et al. 2011), in which we used the basic FTB tag set.",
        "However, this tag set yielded only 0.2% F1 and 1.1% F1 improvements, respectively, for the DP-TSG.",
        "Interpretation of the factored lexicon results should account for resource asymmetries.",
        "For French, the extraordinary result with gold analyses (Stanford+FactLex*) is partly due to annotation errors.",
        "Gold morphological analyses are missing for many of the MWE tokens in the FTB.",
        "The factored lexicon thus learns that when a token has no morphology, it is usually part of an MWE.",
        "In the automatic setting (Stanford+FactLex), however, Morfette tends to assign morphology to the MWE tokens because it has no semantic knowledge.",
        "Consequently, the morphological predictions are less consistent, and the parsing model falls back to the baseline Stanford result.",
        "Certainly more consistent FTB annotations would help Morfette, which we found to be significantly less accurate on our version of the FTB than MADA on the ATB (see Habash and Rambow 2005).",
        "Another remedy would be to incorporate MWE knowledge into the lexical analyzer, a strategy that Constant, Sigogne, and Watrin (2012) recently found to be very effective.",

        "(Arun and Keller 2005) Two versions of the full 20,000- sentence treebank that differed principally in their treatment of MWEs: (1) CONT, in which MWE tokens were grouped (en moyenne ?",
        "en_moyenne); and (2) EXP, in which MWEs were marked with a flat structure.",
        "For both representations, they also gave results in which coordinated phrase structures were flattened.",
        "In the published experiments, they mistakenly removed half of the corpus, believing that the multi-terminal (per POS tag) annotations of MWEs were XML errors (Schluter and van Genabith 2007).",

        "(Candito and Crabb?",
        "2009) A version of the functionally annotated section that makes a distinction between MWEs that are ?syntactically regular?",
        "and those that are not.",
        "Syntactically regular MWEs were given internal structure, whereas all other MWEs were grouped.",
        "For example, nouns followed by adjectives, such as loi agraire (?land law?)",
        "or Union mon'taire et ?conomique (?monetary and economic Union?)",
        "were considered syntactically regular.",
        "They are MWEs because the choice of adjective is arbitrary (loi agraire and not ?loi agricole, similarly to (?coal black?)",
        "but not (?",
        "?crow black?",
        "), for example), but their syntactic structure is not intrinsic to MWEs.",
        "In such cases, FTB-UC gives the MWE a conventional analysis of an NP with internal structure.",
        "Such analysis is indeed sufficient to recover the meaning of these semantically compositional MWEs that are extremely productive.",
        "FTB-UC loses information about MWEs with non-compositional semantics, however.",
        "Almost all work on the FTB has followed ARUN-CONT and used gold MWE pre-grouping.",
        "Candito, Crabb?, and Denis (2010) were the first to acknowledge and address this issue, but they still used FTB-UC (with some pre-grouped MWEs).",
        "Because the syntax and definition of MWEs is a contentious issue, we take a more agnostic view?",
        "which is consistent with that of the FTB annotators?and leave them ungrouped.",
        "This permits a data-oriented approach to MWE identification that is more robust to changes to the status of specific MWE instances.",
        "Green, de Marneffe, and Manning Parsing Models for Identifying Multiword Expressions Although our FTB basic parsing results are lower than those of Seddah (2010), the experiments are not comparable: The data split and preprocessing were different, and he grouped MWEs.",
        "Appendix C: Annotation Consistency of Treebanks Differences in annotation quality among corpora complicate cross-lingual experimental comparisons.",
        "To control for this variable, we performed an annotation consistency evaluation on the PTB, ATB, and FTB.",
        "The conventional wisdom has it that the PTB has comparatively high inter-annotator agreement (IAA).",
        "In the initial release of the ATB, IAA was inferior to other LDC treebanks, although in subsequent revisions, IAA was quantifiably improved (Maamouri, Bies, and Kulick 2008).",
        "The FTB also had significant annotation errors upon release (Arun and Keller 2005), but it, too, has been revised.",
        "To quantify IAA, we extend the variation nucleus method of Dickinson (2005) to compare annotation error rates.",
        "Let C be a set of tuples ?s, l, i?, where s is a substring at corpus position i with label l. We consider all substrings in the corpus.",
        "If s is bracketed at position i, then its label is its non-terminal category.",
        "Otherwise, s has label l = NIL.",
        "To locate variation nuclei, define Ls as the set of all labels associated with each unique s. If |Ls |> 1, then s is a variation nucleus.24 Variation nuclei can result from either annotation errors or linguistic ambiguity.",
        "Human evaluation is one way to distinguish between the two cases.",
        "Following Dickinson (2005), we sampled 100 variation nuclei from each corpus and evaluated each sample for the presence of an annotation error.",
        "To control for the number of corpus positions included in each treebank sample, we used frequency-matched stratified sampling with bin sizes of 2, 3, 4, 10, 50, and 500.",
        "The human evaluators were a non-native, fluent Arabic speaker for the ATB (the first author), a native French speaker for the FTB (the second author), and a native English speaker for the WSJ (the third author).25 Table C.1 shows the results of the evaluation, which supports the anecdotal consistency ranking of the three treebanks.26 The FTB averages more than one variation nucleus per sentence and has twice the token-level error rate of the other two treebanks.",
        "Appendix D: mwetoolkit Configuration We configured mwetoolkit27 with the four standard lexical features: the maximum likelihood estimator, Dice's coefficient, pointwise mutual information, and Student's t-score.",
        "We added the POS sequence for each n-gram as a single feature.",
        "We removed the Web counts features since the parsers do not use auxiliary data.",
        "Because MWE n-grams only account for a small fraction of the n-grams in the corpus, we filtered the training and test sets by removing all n-grams that occurred once.",
        "To further balance the proportion of MWEs, we trained on all valid MWEs plus 10x randomly selected non-MWE n-grams.",
        "This proportion matches the fraction 24 Kulick, Bies, and Mott (2011) extended our method with TAGs to account for nested bracketing errors.",
        "25 Unlike Dickinson (2005), we stripped traces and only considered POS tags when pre-terminals were the only intervening nodes between the nucleus and its bracketing (e.g., unaries, base NPs).",
        "Because our objective was to compare distributions of bracketing discrepancies, we did not prune the set of nuclei.",
        "Evaluation of 100 randomly sampled variation nuclei for training splits of the WSJ, ATB, and FTB.",
        "Corpus positions indicates the number of corpus positions in the sample (a variation nucleus by definition appears in at least two corpus positions).",
        "Nuclei per tree is the average nuclei per syntactic tree in the corpus, a statistic that gives a rough estimate of variability across the corpus.",
        "The type-level error rate indicates the number of variation nuclei for which at least one error existed.",
        "The token-level error rate indicates the ratio of errors to corpus positions.",
        "We computed 95% confidence intervals for the type-level error rate.",
        "of MWE/non-MWE tokens in the FTB.",
        "As we generated a random training set, we reported the average of three independent training runs.",
        "We created feature vectors for the training n-grams and trained a binary SVM classifier with Weka (Hall et al. 2009).",
        "Although mwetoolkit defaults to a linear kernel, we achieved higher accuracy on the development set with an RBF kernel.",
        "The FTB is sufficiently large for the corpus-based methods implemented in mwetoolkit.",
        "Ramisch, Villavicencio, and Boitet (2010) experimented with the Genia corpus, which contains 18k English sentences and 490k tokens, similar to the FTB.",
        "Their test set had 895 sentences, fewer than ours.",
        "They reported 30.6% F1 for their task against an Xtract baseline, which only obtained 7.3% F1.",
        "Their best result compares favorably (in magnitude) to our mwetoolkit baselines for French and Arabic."
