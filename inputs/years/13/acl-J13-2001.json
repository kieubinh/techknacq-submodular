        "Based on these observations, this article proposes a translation mode ratio feature (defined as the proportion of NE internal tokens that are semantically translated), enforces an entity type consistency constraint, and utilizes additional new NE likelihoods (based on the initially detected NE anchors).",
        "Experiments show that this novel method significantly outperforms the baseline.",
        "The type-insensitive F-score of identified NE pairs increases from 78.4% to 88.0% (12.2% relative improvement) in our Chinese?English NE alignment task, and the type-sensitive F-score increases from 68.4% to 83.0% (21.3% relative improvement).",
        "Furthermore, the proposed model demonstrates its robustness when it is tested across different domains.",

        "Named entities (NEs), especially person names (PER), location names (LOC), and organization names (ORG), deliver essential context and meaning in human languages.",
        "Therefore, NE translation plays a critical role in trans-lingual language processing tasks, such as machine translation (MT) and cross-lingual information retrieval.",
        "To learn NE translation knowledge, bilingual NE alignment (which links source NEs and target NEs to generate desired NE pairs) is the first step in producing the NE translation table (which can then be used to train the NE translation model).",
        "Furthermore, with additional alignment constraints from the other language, the alignment module can also refine those initially recognized NEs, and thus can be adopted to conduct semi-supervised learning to learn monolingual NE recognition models from a large untagged bilingual corpus.",
        "Because NE alignment can only be conducted after its associated NEs have been identified, the NE recognition errors propagate into the alignment stage.",
        "The type-insensitive inclusion rate1 of the initial recognition stage thus significantly limits the final alignment performance.",
        "One way to alleviate this error propagation problem is to jointly perform NE recognition and alignment.",
        "Such a combined approach is usually infeasible, however, due to the high computational cost of evaluating alignment scores for a large number2 of NE pair candidates.",
        "In order to make the problem computationally tractable, a sequential approach is usually used to first identify NEs and then align them.",
        "Two such kinds of sequential strategies that alleviate the error propagation problem have been proposed.",
        "The first strategy, named asymmetry alignment (Al-Onaizan and Knight 2002; Moore 2003; Feng, Lv, and Zhou 2004; Lee, Chang, and Jang 2006), identifies NEs only on the source side and then finds their corresponding NEs on the target side.",
        "Although this approach avoids the NE recognition errors resulting from the target side, which would otherwise be brought into the alignment process, the NE recognition errors from the source side continue to affect alignment.",
        "To further reduce the errors from the source side, the second strategy, denoted symmetry alignment (Huang, Vogel, and Waibel 2003), expands the NE candidate sets in both languages before conducting the alignment.",
        "This is achieved by using the original results as anchors, and enlarging or shrinking the boundaries of the anchors to generate new candidates.",
        "This strategy fails to work if the NE anchor has already been missed in the initial NE recognition stage, however.",
        "In our data set (1,000 Chinese?",
        "English sentence pairs randomly selected from the Chinese News Translation Text corpus [LDC2005T06]), this strategy significantly improves the type-insensitive NE pair inclusion rate from 83.9% to 96.1%;3 in the meantime, the type-insensitive Chinese NE (CNE) recognition inclusion rate rises from 88.7% to 95.9%, and that of English NE (ENE) from 92.8% to 97.2%.",
        "This strategy is thus adopted in this article.",
        "Although the symmetric expansion strategy has substantially alleviated the problem of error propagation, the final alignment accuracy, in terms of type-sensitive F-score",
        "Chen, Zong, and Su A Joint Model to Identify and Align Bilingual Named Entities (achieved by the approach proposed by Huang, Vogel, and Waibel [2003]) continues to be as low as 68.4% (see in Table 3 in Section 4.3).",
        "After having examined the data, we found the following: (1) How a given NE is translated, either semantically (called translation) or phonetically (called transliteration), depends greatly on its associated entity type.",
        "The translation mode ratio, which is the percentage of NE internal tokens that are translated semantically, thus can help to identify the NE type.",
        "(2) Entities within an aligned pair should share the same type, and this restriction should be integrated into the NE alignment model as a constraint.",
        "(3) In prior work, the initially identified monolingual NEs were used only to construct the candidate set without playing any role in final NE identification.",
        "Indeed, these monolingual NEs do carry other useful information and can act as anchors to giveNE likelihoods, which can provide additional scope preference information to those regenerated candidates.",
        "Based on these observations, we propose a novel joint model that adopts the translation mode ratio, enforces the entity type consistency constraint, and also utilizes the NE likelihoods.",
        "This proposed approach jointly identifies and aligns bilingual NEs under an integrated framework, which consists of three stages: Initial NE Recognition, NE-Candidate Set Expansion, and NE Re-identification & Alignment.",
        "The Initial NE Recognition stage identifies the initial NEs and their associated NE types in both the source and target.",
        "In the next stage, NE Candidate Set Expansion regenerates the candidate sets in both languages in order to remedy the initial NE recognition errors.",
        "In the final stage, NE Re-identification & Alignment jointly recognizes and aligns bilingual NEs via the proposed joint model.",
        "The experimental results validate our proposed three-step method.",
        "The integrated model that jointly identifies and aligns bilingual named entities between Chinese and English was originally introduced in Chen, Zong, and Su (2010).",

        "On the other hand, classification of English NE type is considered more challenging (Ji and Grishman 2006).",
        "Because alignment would force the NEs in the linked NE pair to share the same semantic meaning, the NE that is more reliably identified in one language can be used to identify its less reliable counterpart in the other language.",
        "This benefit, which is observed in both NE boundary identification and type classification, indicates that alignment can be used to locate those NEs that are initially incorrectly recognized.",
        "For example, once the correct boundaries are drawn in one language, word equivalences inside an aligned NE pair can help identify NE boundaries in the language that does not have explicit clues (e.g., Chinese).",

        "Furthermore, features including local information (e.g., token, part-of-speech) and global information (e.g., label consistency, context features) from monolingual resources have been adopted (Krishman and Manning 2006; Zhou and Su 2006).",
        "In prior work on the use of bilingual NE alignment for NE recognition, Huang and Vogel (2004) used an iterative process to extract a smaller but cleaner NE translation dictionary and then used the dictionary to improve the monolingual NE annotation quality.",

        "Recent studies have therefore focused on extracting new NE pairs from either bilingual corpora or Web resources, so that the corresponding human translation can be directly adopted (or used for training).",
        "To do this, however, NE alignment is an essential tool.",
        "Due to the relatively poor quality of Web data, such alignment approaches are usually limited unless significant effort is devoted to data cleaning; therefore, we do not discuss these approaches.",
        "To extract the NE pairs from bilingual corpora, all NE alignment approaches we found in the literature are conducted after an initial NE identification stage so that the complexity of the task can be reduced.",

        "Finally, the proposed model does not utilize language-dependent features.",
