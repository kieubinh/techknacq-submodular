        "Fine-grained opinion analysis methods often make use of linguistic features but typically do not take the interaction between opinions into account.",
        "This article describes a set of experiments that demonstrate that relational features, mainly derived from dependency-syntactic and semantic role structures, can significantly improve the performance of automatic systems for a number of fine-grained opinion analysis tasks: marking up opinion expressions, finding opinion holders, and determining the polarities of opinion expressions.",
        "These features make it possible to model the way opinions expressed in natural-language discourse interact in a sentence over arbitrary distances.",
        "The use of relations requires us to consider multiple opinions simultaneously, which makes the search for the optimal analysis intractable.",
        "However, a reranker can be used as a sufficiently accurate and efficient approximation.",
        "A number of feature sets and machine learning approaches for the rerankers are evaluated.",
        "For the task of opinion expression extraction, the best model shows a 10-point absolute improvement in soft recall on the MPQA corpus over a conventional sequence labeler based on local contextual features, while precision decreases only slightly.",
        "Significant improvements are also seen for the extended tasks where holders and polarities are considered: 10 and 7 points in recall, respectively.",
        "In addition, the systems outperform previously published results for unlabeled (6 F-measure points) and polarity-labeled (10?15 points) opinion expression extraction.",
        "Finally, as an extrinsic evaluation, the extracted MPQA-style opinion expressions are used in practical opinion mining tasks.",
        "In all scenarios considered, the machine learning features derived from the opinion expressions lead to statistically significant improvements.",

        "Apart from their interest from a linguistic and psychological point of view, the technologies emerging from this research have obvious practical uses, either as standalone applications or supporting other tools such as information retrieval or question answering systems.",
        "The research community initially focused on high-level tasks such as retrieving documents or passages expressing opinion, or classifying the polarity of a given text, and these coarse-grained problem formulations naturally led to the application of methods derived from standard retrieval or text categorization techniques.",
        "The models underlying these approaches have used very simple feature representations such as purely lexical (Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan 2002; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou 2003) or low-level grammatical features such as part-of-speech tags and functional words (Wiebe, Bruce, and O?Hara 1999).",
        "This is in line with the general consensus in the information retrieval community that very little can be gained by complex linguistic processing for tasks such as text categorization and search (Moschitti and Basili 2004).",
        "There are a few exceptions, such as Karlgren et al. (2010), who showed that construction features added to a bag-of-words representation resulted in improved performance on a number of coarse-grained opinion analysis tasks.",
        "Similarly, Greene and Resnik (2009) argued that a speaker's attitude can be predicted from syntactic features such as the selection of a transitive or intransitive verb frame.",
        "In contrast to the early work, recent years have seen a shift towards more detailed problem formulations where the task is not only to find a piece of opinionated text, but also to extract a structured representation of the opinion.",
        "For instance, we may determine the person holding the opinion (the holder) and towards which entity or fact it is directed (the topic), whether it is positive or negative (the polarity), and the strength of the opinion (the intensity).",
        "The increasing complexity of representation leads us from retrieval and categorization deep into natural language processing territory; the methods used here have been inspired by information extraction and semantic role labeling, combinatorial optimization, and structured machine learning.",
        "For such tasks, deeper representations of linguistic structure have seen more use than in the coarse-grained case.",
        "Syntactic and shallow-semantic relations have repeatedly proven useful for subtasks of opinion analysis that are relational in nature, above all for determining the holder or topic of a given opinion, in which case there is considerable similarity to tasks such as semantic role labeling (Kim and Hovy 2006; Ruppenhofer, Somasundaran, and Wiebe 2008).",
        "There has been no systematic research, however, on the role played by linguistic structure in the relations between opinions expressed in text, despite the fact that the opinion expressions in a sentence are not independent but organized rhetorically to achieve a communicative effect intended by the speaker.",
        "We therefore expect that the interplay between opinion expressions can be exploited to derive information useful for the analysis of opinions expressed in text.",
        "In this article, we start from this intuition and propose several novel features derived from the interdependencies between opinion expressions on the syntactic and shallow-semantic levels.",
        "Based on these features, we devised structured prediction models for (1) extraction of opinion expressions, (2) joint expression extraction and holder extraction, and (3) joint expression extraction and polarity labeling.",
        "The models were trained using a number of discriminative machine learning methods.",
        "Because the interdependency features required us to consider more than one opinion expression at a time, the inference steps carried out at training and prediction time could not rely on commonly used opinion expression mark-up methods based on Viterbi search, but we show that an approximate search method using reranking suffices for this purpose: In a first step a base system",
        "Johansson and Moschitti Relational Features in Fine-Grained Opinion Analysis using local features and efficient search generates a small set of hypotheses, and in a second step a classifier using the complex features selects the final output from the hypothesis set.",
        "This approach allows us to make use of arbitrary features extracted from the complete set of opinion expressions in a sentence, without having to impose any restriction on the expressivity of the features.",
        "An additional advantage is that it is fairly easy to implement as long as the underlying system is able to generate k-best output.",
        "The interaction-based reranking systems were evaluated on a test set extracted from the MPQA corpus, and compared to strong baselines consisting of standalone systems for opinion expression mark-up, opinion holder extraction, and polarity classification.",
        "Our evaluations showed that (1) the best opinion expression mark-up system we evaluated achieved a 10-point absolute improvement in soft recall, and a 5-point improvement in F-measure, over the baseline sequence labeler.",
        "Our system outperformed previously described opinion expression mark-up tools by six points in overlap F-measure.",
        "(2) The recall was boosted by almost 10 points for the holder extraction task (over three points in F-measure) by modeling the interaction of opinion expressions with respect to holders.",
        "(3) We saw an improvement for the extraction of polarity-labeled expression of four F-measure points.",
        "Our result for opinion extraction and polarity labeling is especially striking when compared with the best previously published end-to-end system for this task: 10?15 points in F-measure improvement.",
        "In addition to the performance evaluations, we studied the impact of features on the subtasks, and the effect of the choice of the machine learning method for training the reranker.",
        "As a final extrinsic evaluation of the system, we evaluated the usefulness of its output in a number of applications.",
        "Although there have been several publications detailing the extraction of MPQA-style opinion expressions, as far as we are aware there has been no attempt to use them in an application.",
        "In contrast, we show that the opinion expressions as defined by the MPQA corpus may be used to derive machine learning features that are useful in two practical opinion mining tasks; the addition of these features leads to statistically significant improvements in all scenarios we evaluated.",
        "First, we develop a system for the extraction of evaluations of product attributes from product reviews (Hu and Liu 2004a, 2004b; Popescu and Etzioni 2005; Titov and McDonald 2008), and we show that the features derived from opinion expressions lead to significant improvement.",
        "Secondly, we show that fine-grained opinion structural information can even be used to build features that improve a coarse-grained sentiment task: document polarity classification of reviews (Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan 2002; Pang and Lee 2004).",
        "After the present introduction, Section 2 gives a linguistic motivation and an overview of the related work; Section 3 describes the MPQA opinion corpus and its underlying representation; Section 4 illustrates the baseline systems: a sequence labeler for the extraction of opinion expressions and classifiers for opinion holder extraction and polarity labeling; Section 5 reports on the main contribution: the description of the interaction models and their features; finally, Section 7 presents the experimental results and Section 8 derives the conclusions."

        "Intuitively, interdependency features could be useful in the process of locating and disambiguating expressions of opinion.",
        "These expressions tend to occur in patterns, and the presence of one opinionated piece of text may influence our interpretation of another as opinionated or not.",
        "Consider, for instance, the word said in sentences (a) and (b) in Example (1), where the presence or non-presence of emotionally loaded words in the",
        " complement clause provides evidence for the interpretation as a subjective opinion or an objective speech event.",
        "(In the example, opinionated expressions are marked S for subjective and the non-opinionated speech event O for objective.)",
        "(a) ?We will identify the [culprits]S of these clashes and [punish]S them,?",
        "he [said]S. (b) On Monday, 80 Libyan soldiers disembarked from an Antonov transport plane",
        "carrying military equipment, an African diplomat [said]O.",
        "Moreover, opinions expressed in a sentence are interdependent when it comes to the resolution of their holders?the person or entity having the attitude expressed in the opinion expression.",
        "Clearly, the structure of the sentence is also influential for this task because certain linguistic constructions provide evidence for opinion holder correlation.",
        "In the most obvious case, shown in the two sentences in Example (2), pejorative words share the opinion holder with the communication and categorization verbs dominating them.",
        "(Here, opinions are marked S and holders H.)",
        "Example (2) (a) [Domestic observers]H [tended to side with]S the MDC, [denouncing]S the election as [fraud-tainted]S and [unfair]S. (b) [Bush]H [labeled]S North Korea, Iran and Iraq an ?",
        "[axis of evil]S.?",
        "In addition, interaction is important when determining opinion polarity.",
        "Here, relations that influence polarity interpretation include coordination, verb?complement, as well as other types of discourse relations.",
        "In particular, the presence of a COMPARISON discourse relation, such as contrast or concession (Prasad et al. 2008), may allow us to infer that opinion expressions have different polarities.",
        "In Example (3), we see how contrastive discourse connectives (underlined) are used when there are contrasting polarities in the surrounding opinion expressions.",
        "(Positive opinions are tagged ?+?, negative ?-?.)",
        "(a) ?",
        "[This is no blind violence but rather targeted violence]-,?",
        "Annemie Neyts [said]-.",
        "?However, the movement [is more than that]+.?",
        "(b) ?",
        "[Trade alone will not save the world]-,?",
        "Neyts [said]-, but it constitutes an [important]+ factor for economic development.",
        "The problems we focus on in this article?extracting opinion expressions with holders and polarity labeling?have naturally been studied previously, especially since the release of the MPQA corpus (Wiebe, Wilson, and Cardie 2005).",
        "For the first subtask, because the MPQA corpus uses span-based annotation to represent opinions, it is natural to apply straightforward sequence labeling techniques to extract them.",
        "This idea has resulted in a number of publications (Choi, Breck, and Cardie 2006; Breck, Choi, and Cardie 2007).",
        "Such systems do not use any features describing the interaction between opinions, and it would not be possible to add interaction features because a Viterbi-based sequence labeler by construction is restricted to using local features in a small contextual window.",
        "Works using syntactic features to extract topics and holders of opinions are numerous (Bethard et al. 2005; Kobayashi, Inui, and Matsumoto 2007; Joshi and Penstein-Rose?",
        "Johansson and Moschitti Relational Features in Fine-Grained Opinion Analysis 2009; Wu et al. 2009).",
        "Semantic role analysis has also proven useful: Kim and Hovy (2006) used a FrameNet-based semantic role labeler to determine holder and topic of opinions.",
        "Similarly, Choi, Breck, and Cardie (2006) successfully used a PropBank-based role labeler for opinion holder extraction, and Wiegand and Klakow (2010) recently applied tree kernel learning methods on a combination of syntactic and semantic role trees for extracting holders, but did not consider their relations to the opinion expressions.",
        "Ruppenhofer, Somasundaran, and Wiebe (2008) argued that semantic role techniques are useful but not completely sufficient for holder and topic identification, and that other linguistic phenomena must be studied as well.",
        "Choi, Breck, and Cardie (2006) built a joint model of opinion expression extraction and holder extraction and applied integer linear programming to carry out the optimization step.",
        "While the tasks of opinion expression detection and polarity classification of opinion expressions (Wilson, Wiebe, and Hoffmann 2009) have mostly been studied in isolation, Choi and Cardie (2010) developed a sequence labeler that simultaneously extracted opinion expressions and assigned them polarity values and this is so far the only published result on joint opinion segmentation and polarity classification.",
        "Their experiment, however, lacked the obvious baseline: a standard pipeline consisting of an expression tagger followed by a polarity classifier.",
        "In addition, although their model is the first end-to-end system for opinion expression extraction and polarity classification, it is still based on sequence labeling and thus by construction limited in feature expressivity.",
        "On a conceptual level, discourse-oriented approaches (Asher, Benamara, and Mathieu 2009; Somasundaran et al. 2009; Zirn et al. 2011) applying interaction features for polarity classification are arguably the most related because they are driven by a vision similar to ours: Individual opinion expressions interplay in discourse and thus provide information about each other.",
        "On a practical level there are obvious differences, since our features are extracted from syntactic and shallow-semantic linguistic representations, which we argue are reflections of discourse structure, while they extract features directly from a discourse representation.",
        "It is doubtful whether automatic discourse representation extraction in text is currently mature enough to provide informative features, whereas syntactic parsing and shallow-semantic analysis are today fairly reliable.",
        "Another related line of work is represented by Choi and Cardie (2008), where interaction features based on compositional semantics were used in a joint model for the assignment of polarity values to pre-segmented opinion expressions in a sentence."

        "The most detailed linguistic resource useful for developing automatic systems for opinion analysis is theMPQA corpus (Wiebe,Wilson, and Cardie 2005).",
        "In this article, we use the word opinion in its broadest sense, equivalent to the word private state used by the MPQA annotators (page 2): ?opinions, emotions, sentiments, speculations, evaluations, and other private states (Quirk et al. 1985), i.e., internal states that cannot be directly observed by others.?",
        "The central building block in the MPQA annotation is the opinion expression (or subjective expression): A text piece that expresses a private state, allowing us to draw the conclusion that someone has a particular emotion or belief about some topic.",
        "Identifying these units allows us to carry out further analysis, such as the determination of opinion holder and the polarity of the opinion.",
        "The annotation scheme defines two types of opinion expressions: direct subjective expressions (DSEs), which are explicit",

        "Johansson and Moschitti Relational Features in Fine-Grained Opinion Analysis Because our feature sets are based on interaction between opinion expressions that can appear anywhere in a sentence, exact inference in this model becomes intractable.",
        "To overcome this issue, we used an approximate search strategy based on reranking: In the first step, we used the baseline systems, which use only simple local features, to generate a relatively small hypothesis set; we then applied a classifier using interaction features to pick the final result.",
        "A common objection to reranking is that the candidate set may not be diverse enough to allow for much improvement unless it is very large; the candidates may be trivial variations that are all very similar to the top-scoring candidate.",
        "Investigating inference methods that take a less brute-force approach than plain reranking is thus another possible future direction.",
        "Interesting examples of such inference methods include forest reranking (Huang 2008) and loopy belief propagation (Smith and Eisner 2008).",
        "Nevertheless, although the development of such algorithms is a fascinating research problem, it will not necessarily result in a more usable system: Rerankers impose very few restrictions on feature expressivity andmake it easy to trade accuracy for efficiency.",
        "We investigated the effect of machine learning features, as well as other design parameters such as the choice of machine learning method and the size of the hypothesis set.",
        "For the features, we analyzed the impact of using syntax and semantics and saw that the best models are those making use of both.",
        "The most effective features we have found are purely structural, based on tree fragments in a syntactic or semantic tree.",
        "Features involving words generally did not seem to have the same impact.",
        "Sparsity may certainly be an issue for features defined in terms of tree fragments.",
        "Possible future extensions in this area could include bootstrapping methods to mine for meaningful fragments unseen in the training set, or methods to group such features into clusters to reduce the sparsity.",
        "In addition to the core results on fine-grained opinion analysis, we have described experiments demonstrating that features extracted from opinion expressions can be used to improve practical applications: extraction of evaluations of product attributes, and document polarity classification.",
        "Although for the first task it may be fairly obvious that it is useful to carry out a fine-grained analysis of the sentence opinion structure, the second result is more unexpected because the document polarity classification task is a high-level and coarse-grained task.",
        "For both tasks, we saw statistically significant increases in performance compared not only to simple baselines, but also compared to strong baselines using a lexicon of sentiment words.",
        "Although the lexicon leads to clear improvements, the best classifiers also used the features extracted from the opinion expressions.",
        "It is remarkable that the opinion expressions as defined by the MPQA corpus are useful for practical applications on reviews from several domains, because this corpus mainly consists of news documents related to political topics; this shows that the expression identifier has been able to generalize from the specific domains.",
        "It would still be relevant, however, to apply domain adaptation techniques (Blitzer, Dredze, and Pereira 2007).",
        "It could also be interesting to see how domain-specific opinion word lexicons could improve over the generic lexicon we used here; especially if such a lexicon were automatically constructed (Jijkoun, de Rijke, and Weerkamp 2010).",
        "There are multiple additional opportunities for future work in this area.",
        "An important issue that we have left open is the coreference problem for holder extraction, which has been studied by Stoyanov and Cardie (2006).",
        "Similarly, recent work has tried to incorporate complex, high-level linguistic structure such as discourse representations (Asher, Benamara, and Mathieu 2009; Somasundaran et al. 2009; Zirn et al. 2011); it is clear that these structures are very relevant for explaining the way humans organize",
        " their expressions of opinions rhetorically.",
        "Theoretical depth does not necessarily guarantee practical applicability, however, and the challenge is as usual to find a middle ground that balances our goals: explanatory power in theory, significant performance gains in practice, computational tractability, and robustness in difficult circumstances."
