        "Ontologies can be classified into three main types (Sowa 2000), namely: i) formal ontologies, that is, conceptualizations whose categories are distinguished by axioms and formal definitions, stated in logic to support complex inferences and computations; ii) prototype-based ontologies, which are based on typical instances or prototypes rather than axioms and definitions in logic; iii) lexical-ized (or terminological) ontologies, which are specified by subtype-supertype relations and describe concepts by labels or synonyms rather than by prototypical instances.",

        "Manually constructing ontologies is a very demanding task, however, requiring a large amount of time and effort, even when principled solutions are used (De Nicola, Missikoff, and Navigli 2009).",
        "A quite recent challenge, referred to as ontology learning, consists of automatically or semi-automatically creating a lexicalized ontology using textual data from corpora or the Web (Gomez-Perez and Manzano-Mancho 2003; Biemann 2005; Maedche and Staab 2009; Petasis et al. 2011).",

        "OntoLearn Reloaded preserves the initial step of our 2004 pioneering work (Navigli and Velardi 2004), that is, automated terminology extraction from a domain corpus, but it drops the requirement for WordNet (thereby avoiding dependence on the English language).",
        "It also drops the term compositionality assumption that previously led to us having to use a Word Sense Disambiguation algorithm?namely, SSI (Navigli and Velardi 2005)?to structure the taxonomy.",

        "Two main approaches are used to learn an ontology from text: rule-based and distributional approaches.",
        "Rule-based approaches use predefined rules or heuristic patterns to extract terms and relations.",
        "These approaches are typically based on lexico-syntactic patterns, first introduced by Hearst (1992).",
        "Instances of relations are harvested from text by applying patterns aimed at capturing a certain type of relation (e.g., X is a kind of Y).",
        "Such lexico-syntactic patterns can be defined manually (Berland and Charniak 1999; Kozareva, Riloff, and Hovy 2008) or obtained by means of bootstrapping techniques (Girju, Badulescu, and Moldovan 2006; Pantel and Pennacchiotti 2006).",
        "In the latter case, a number of term pairs in the wanted relation are manually picked and the relation is sought within text corpora or the Web.",
        "Other rule-based approaches learn a taxonomy by applying heuristics to collaborative resources such as Wikipedia (Suchanek, Kasneci, and Weikum 2008; Ponzetto and Strube 2011), also with the supportive aid of computational lexicons such as WordNet (Ponzetto and Navigli 2009).",
        "Distributional approaches, instead, model ontology learning as a clustering or classification task, and draw primarily on the notions of distributional similarity (Pad√≥ and Lapata 2007; Cohen and Widdows 2009), clustering of formalized statements (Poon and Domingos 2010), or hierarchical random graphs (Fountain and Lapata 2012).",
        "Such approaches are based on the assumption that paradigmatically-related concepts2 appear in similar contexts and their main advantage is that they are able to discover relations that do not explicitly appear in the text.",
        "They are typically less accurate, however, and the selection of feature types, notion of context, and similarity metrics vary considerably depending on the specific approach used.",
        " Recently, Yang and Callan (2009) presented a semi-supervised taxonomy induction framework that integrates contextual, co-occurrence, and syntactic dependencies, lexico-syntactic patterns, and other features to learn an ontology metric, calculated in terms of the semantic distance for each pair of terms in a taxonomy.",
        "Terms are incrementally clustered on the basis of their ontology metric scores.",
        "In their work, the authors assume that the set of ontological concepts C is known, therefore taxonomy learning is limited to finding relations between given pairs in C. In the experiments, they only use the word senses within a particular WordNet sub-hierarchy so as to avoid any lexical ambiguity.",
        "Their best experiment obtains a 0.85 precision rate and 0.32 recall rate in replicating is-a links on 12 focused WordNet sub-hierarchies, such as PEOPLE, BUILDING, PLACE, MILK, MEAL, and so on.",
        "Snow, Jurafsky, and Ng (2006) propose the incremental construction of taxonomies using a probabilistic model.",
        "In their work they combine evidence from multiple supervised classifiers trained on very large training data sets of hyponymy and cousin relations.",
        "Given the body of evidence obtained from all the relevant word pairs in a lexico-syntactic relation, the taxonomy learning task is defined probabilistically as the problem of finding the taxonomy that maximizes the probability of having that evidence (a supervised logistic regression model is used for this).",
        "Rather than learning a new taxonomy from scratch, however, this approach aims at attaching new concepts under the appropriate nodes of an existing taxonomy (i.e., WordNet).",
        "The approach is evaluated by manually assessing the quality of the single hypernymy edges connecting leaf concepts to existing ones in WordNet, with no evaluation of a full-fledged structured taxonomy and no restriction to a specific domain.",
        "A related, weakly supervised approach aimed at categorizing named entities, and attaching them to WordNet leaves, was proposed by Pa≈üca (2004).",
        "Other approaches use formal concept analysis (Cimiano, Hotho, and Staab 2005), probabilistic and information-theoretic measures to learn taxonomies from a folksonomy (Tang et al. 2009), and Markov logic networks and syntactic parsing applied to domain text (Poon and Domingos 2010).",
        "The work closest to ours is that presented by Kozareva and Hovy (2010).",
        "From an initial given set of root concepts and basic level terms, the authors first use Hearst-like lexico-syntactic patterns iteratively to harvest new terms from the Web.",
        "As a result a set of hyponym?hypernym relations is obtained.",
        "Next, in order to induce taxonomic relations between intermediate concepts, the Web is searched again with surface patterns.",
        "Finally, nodes from the resulting graph are removed if the out-degree is below a threshold, and edges are pruned by removing cycles and selecting the longest path in the case of multiple paths between concept pairs.",
        "Kozareva and Hovy's method has some limitations, which we discuss later in this paper.",
        "Here we note that, in evaluating their methodology, the authors discard any retrieved nodes not belonging to a WordNet sub-hierarchy (they experiment on PLANTS, VEHICLES, and ANIMALS), thus it all comes down to Yang and Callan's (2009) experiment of finding relations between a preassigned set of nodes.",
        "In practice, none of the algorithms described in the literature was actually applied to the task of creating a new taxonomy for an arbitrary domain of interest truly from scratch.",
        "Instead, what is typically measured is the ability of a system to reproduce as far as possible the relations of an already existing taxonomy (a common test is WordNet or the Open Directory Project3), when given the set of domain concepts.",

        "In fact, the predecessor of OntoLearn Reloaded, that is, OntoLearn (Navigli and Velardi 2004), suffers from a similar problem, in that it relies on the WordNet taxonomy to establish paradigmatic connections between concepts."

        "This method is applicable when the set of taxonomy concepts are given, and the evaluation task is restricted to measuring the ability to reproduce hypernymy links between concept pairs.",
        "The evaluation is far more complex when learning a specialized taxonomy entirely from scratch, that is, when both terms and relations are unknown.",

        "Taxonomy induction was applied to the task of creating new ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE and FINANCE taxonomies and four taxonomies for gold-standard comparison against WordNet and MeSH.29 Our experimental analysis shows that OntoLearn Reloaded greatly simplifies the task of acquiring a taxonomy from scratch: Using a taxonomy validation tool,30 a team of experts can correct the errors and create a much more acceptable taxonomy in a matter of hours, rather than man-months, also thanks to the automatic acquisition of textual definitions for our concepts.",
        "As with any automated and unsupervised learning tool, however, OntoLearn does make errors, as we discussed in Section 4.",
        "The accuracy of the resulting taxonomy is clearly related to the number and quality of discovered definitional patterns, which is in turn related to the maturity and generality of a domain.",
        "Even with good definitions, problems might arise due to in-and out-domain ambiguity, the latter being probably the major source of errors, together with complex definitional structures.",
        "Although we believe that there is still room for improvement to OntoLearn Reloaded, certain errors would appear unavoidable, especially for less focused and relatively dynamic domains like ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE and FINANCE, in which new terms arise continuously and have very few, or no definitions on the Web.",
        "Future work includes the addition of non-taxonomical relations along the lines of ReVerb (Etzioni et al. 2011) and WiSeNet (Moro and Navigli 2012), and a more sophisticated rank-based method for scoring textual definitions.",
        "Finally, we plan to tackle the issue of automatically discriminating between in-domain ambiguity and systematic polysemy (as discussed in Section 4.3.2)."
