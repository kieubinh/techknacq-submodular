        "There have been many recent investigations into methods to tune SMT systems using large numbers of sparse features.",
        "However, there have not been nearly so many examples of helpful sparse features, especially for phrase-based systems.",
        "We use sparse features to address reordering, which is often considered a weak point of phrase-based translation.",
        "Using a hierarchical reordering model as our baseline, we show that simple features coupling phrase orientation to frequent words or word-clusters can improve translation quality, with boosts of up to 1.2 BLEU points in Chinese-English and 1.8 in Arabic-English.",
        "We compare this solution to a more traditional maximum entropy approach, where a probability model with similar features is trained on word-aligned bitext.",
        "We show that sparse decoder features outperform maximum entropy handily, indicating that there are major advantages to optimizing reordering features directly for BLEU with the decoder in the loop."

        "With the growing adoption of tuning algorithms that can handle thousands of features (Chiang et al., 2008; Hopkins and May, 2011), SMT system designers now face a choice when incorporating new ideas into their translation models.",
        "Maximum likelihood models can be estimated from large word-aligned bitexts, creating a small number of highly informative decoder features; or the same ideas can be incorporated into the decoder's linear model directly.",
        "There are trade-offs to each approach.",
        "Maximum likelihood models can be estimated from millions of sentences of bitext, but optimize a mismatched objective, predicting events observed in word aligned bitext instead of optimizing translation quality.",
        "Sparse decoder features have the opposite problem; with the decoder in the loop, we can only tune on small development sets,1 but a translation error metric directly informs training.",
        "We investigate this trade-off in the context of reordering models for phrase-based decoding.",
        "Starting with the intuition that most lexicalized reordering models do not smooth their orientation distributions intelligently for low-frequency phrase-pairs, we design features that track the first and last words (or clusters) of the phrases in a pair.",
        "These features are incorporated into a maximum entropy reordering model, as well as sparse decoder features, to see which approach best complements the now-standard relative-frequency lexicalized reordering model.",
        "We also view our work as an example of strong sparse features for phrase-based translation.",
        "Features from hierarchical and syntax-based translation (Chiang et al., 2009) do not easily transfer to the phrase-based paradigm, and most work that has looked at large feature counts in the context of phrase-based translation has focused on the learning method, and not the features themselves (Hopkins and May, 2011; Cherry and Foster, 2012; Gimpel and Smith, 2012).",
        "We show that by targeting reordering, large gains can be made with relatively simple features."

        "Figure 1 shows how BLEU (averaged across both test sets) and perplexity vary as training data increases from 1.5K sentences to the full 1.5M.",
        "At Pa < 0.1, corresponding to less than 150K sentences, the maximum entropy model actually makes a substantial difference in terms of BLEU.",
        "However, these deltas narrow to nothing as we reach millions of training sentences.",
        "This is consistent with the results of Nguyen et al. (2009), who report that maximum entropy reordering outperforms a similar baseline, but using only 50K sentence pairs.",
        "A related observation is that held-out perplexity does not seem to predict BLEU in any useful way.",
        "In particular, perplexity does not predict that the two systems will become similar as data grows, nor does it predict that maxent's performance will level off.",
        "Predicting the orientations of unseen alignments is not the same task as predicting the orientation for a phrase during translation.",
        "We suspect that perplexity places too much emphasis on rare or previously unseen phrase pairs, due to phrase extraction's heavy tails.",
        "Preliminary attempts to correct for this using absolute discounting on the test counts did not resolve these issues.",
        "Unfortunately, in maximizing (regularized or smoothed) likelihood, both maxent and relative frequency HRMs are chasing the perplexity objective, not the BLEU objective."

        "ganized subsets of the complete feature set for Arabic-English.",
        "Count is the number of distinct features, while BLEU is averaged over mt08 and mt09.",
        "intersected features indicates that modeling context outside a phrase is not essential for strong performance.",
        "Furthermore, the ?HRM portion of the table indicates that the sparse HRM does not require the baseline HRM to be present in order to outperform it.",
        "This is remarkable when one considers that the Sparse HRM uses less than 4k features to model phrase orientations, compared to the 530M probabilities7 maintained by the baseline HRM's relative frequency model.",
        "To determine which feature groups are most important, we tested the Sparse HRM on Arabic-English with a number of feature subsets.",
        "We report BLEU scores averaged over both test sets in Table 8.",
        "First, we break our features into three groups according to what part of the hypothesis is used to assess orientation.",
        "For each of these location groups, all forms of word representation (clusters or frequent words) are employed.",

        "Each group was tested alone to measure its usefulness.",
        "This results in a clear hierarchy, with the phrase features being the most useful (nearly as useful as the complete system), and the between features being the least.",
        "Second, we break our features into three groups according to how words are represented.",
        "For each of these representation groups, all location groups (Between, Stack and Phrase) are employed.",
        "The groups are quite intuitive: 20 Clusters, 50 Clusters or 80 Words.",
        "The differences between representations are much less dramatic than the location groups.",
        "All representations perform well on their own, with the finer-grained ones performing better.",
        "Including multiple representations provides a slight boost, but these experiments suggest that a leaner model could certainly drop one or two representations with little impact.",
        "In its current implementation, the Sparse HRM is roughly 4 times slower than the baseline decoder.",
        "Our sparse feature infrastructure is designed for flexibility, not speed.",
        "To affect reordering, each sparse feature template is reapplied with each hypothesis extension.",
        "However, the intersected feature set from ?5.1 is only 2 times slower, and could be made faster still.",
        "That feature set uses only within-phrase features to asses orientations; therefore, the total weight for each orientation for each phrase-pair could be pre-calculated, making its cost comparable to the baseline."

        "We have shown that sparse reordering features can improve the quality of phrase-based translations, even in the presence of lexicalized reordering models that track the same orientations.",
        "We have compared this solution to a maximum entropy model, which does not improve our HRM baseline.",
        "Our analysis of the maximum entropy solution indicates that smoothing the orientation estimates is not a major concern in the presence of millions of sentences of bitext.",
        "This implies that our sparse features are achieving their improvement because they optimize BLEU with the decoder in the loop, sidestepping the objective mismatch that can occur when training on word-aligned data.",
        "The fact that this is possible with such small tuning corpora is both surprising and encouraging.",
        "In the future, we would like to investigate how to incorporate useful future cost estimates for our sparse reordering features.",
        "Previous work has shown future distortion penalty estimates to be important for both translation speed and quality (Moore and Quirk, 2007; Green et al., 2010), but we have ignored future costs in this work.",
        "We would also like to investigate features inspired by transition-based parsing, such as features that look further down the reordering stack.",
        "Finally, as there is evidence that ideas from lexicalized reordering can help hierarchical phrase-based SMT (Huck et al., 2012), it would be interesting to explore the use of sparse RMs in that setting."
