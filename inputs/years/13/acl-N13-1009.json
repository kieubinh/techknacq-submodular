        "Native Language Identification (NLI) is a classification task in which a statistical signal is exploited to determine an author's native language (L1) from their writing in a second language (L2).",
        "This academic exercise is often motivated not only by fraud detection or authorship attribution for which L1 can be an informative feature, but also by its potential to assist in Second Language Acquisition (SLA).",
        "Our work focuses on the latter application and on the observation that the actual ability to automatically determine L1 from text is of limited utility in the SLA domain, where the native language of a student is either known or easily solicited.",
        "Instead, the likely role of NLP in the context of SLA is to provide a set of linguistic patterns that students with certain L1 backgrounds use with a markedly unusual frequency.",
        "Experiments have shown that such L1 specific information can be incorporated into lesson plans that improve student performance (Laufer and Girsai, 2008; Horst et al. 2008).",
        "This is essentially a feature selection task with the additional caveat that features should be individually discriminative between native languages in order to facilitate the construction of focused educational ex-cersizes.",
        "With this goal, we consider metrics for data set dependence, relevancy, and redundancy.",
        "We show that measures of relevancy based on mutual information can be inappropriate in problems such as ours where rare features are important.",
        "While the majority of the methods that we consider generalize to any of the various feature sets employed in NLI, we focus on the use of Tree Substitution Grammar rules as features.",
        "Obtaining a compact feature set is possible with the well known Bayesian grammar induction algorithm (Cohn and Blunsom, 2010), but its rich get richer dynamics can make it difficult to find rare features.",
        "We extend the induction model to a supervised mixture of latent grammars and show how it can be used to incorporate linguistic knowledge and extract discriminative features more effectively.",
        "The end result of this technique is a filtered list of patterns along with their usage statistics.",
        "This provides an enhanced resource for SLA research such as Jarvis and Crossley (2012) which tackles the manual connection of highly discriminative features with plausible linguistic transfer explanations.",
        "We output a compact list of language patterns that are empirically associated with native language labels, avoid",
        "ing redundancy and artifacts from the corpus creation process.",
        "We release this list for use by the linguistics and SLA research communities, and plan to expand it with upcoming releases of L1 labeled corpora1."

        "Our work is closely related to the recent surge of research in NLI.",
        "Beginning with Koppel et al(2005), several papers have proposed different feature sets to be used as predictors of L1 (Tsur and Rappa-port, 2007; Wong and Dras, 2011a; Swanson and Charniak, 2012).",
        "However, due to the ubiquitous use of random subsamples, different data preparation methods, and severe topic and annotation biases of the data set employed, there is little consensus on which feature sets are ideal or sufficient, or if any reported accuracies reflect some generalizable truth of the problem's difficulty.",
        "To combat the bias of a single data set, a new strain of work has emerged in which train and test documents come from different corpora (Brooke and Hirst, 2012; Tetreault et al., 2012; Bykh and Meurers, 2012).",
        "We follow this cross corpus approach, as it is crucial to any claims of feature relevance.",
        "Feature selection itself is a well studied problem, and the most thorough systems address both relevancy and redundancy.",
        "While some work tackles these problems by optimizing a metric over both simultaneously (Peng et al. 2005), we decouple the notions of relevancy and redundancy to allow ad-hoc metrics for either, similar to the method of Yu and Liu (2004).",
        "The measurement of feature relevancy in NLI has to this point been handled primarily with Information Gain, and elimination of feature redundancy has not been considered.",
        "Tree Substitution Grammars have recently been successfully applied in several domains using the induction algorithm presented by Cohn and Blunsom (2010).",
        "Our hierarchical treatment builds on this work by incorporating supervised mixtures over latent grammars into this induction process.",
        "Latent mixture techniques for NLI have been explored with other feature types (Wong and Dras, 2011b; Wong and Dras, 2012), but have not previously led to measurable empirical gains.",

        "The first three consist of responses to essay prompts in educational settings, while the fourth is submitted by users in an internet forum.",
        "The first corpus is the International Corpus of Learner English (ICLE) (Granger et al. 2002), a mainstay in NLI that has been shown to exhibit a large topic bias due to correlations between L1 and the essay prompts used (Brooke and Hirst, 2011).",
        "The second is the International Corpus of Crosslin-guistic Interlanguage (ICCI) (Tono et al. 2012), which is annotated with sentence boundaries and has yet to be used in NLI.",
        "The third is the public sample of the Cambridge International Corpus (FCE), and consists of short prompted responses.",
        "One quirk of the FCE data is that several responses are written in the form of letters, leading to skewed distributions of the specialized syntax involved with use of the second person.",
        "The fourth is the Lang8 data set introduced by Brooke and Hirst (2011).",
        "This data set is free of format, with no prompts or constraints on writing aids.",
        "The samples are often very short and are qualitatively the most noisy of the four data sets.",
        "One distinctive experimental decision is to treat each sentence as an individual datum.",
        "As document length can vary dramatically, especially across corpora, this gives increased regularity to the number of features per data item.",
        "More importantly, this creates a rough correspondence between feature co-occurrence and the expression of the same underlying linguistic phenomenon, which is desirable for automatic redundancy metrics.",
        "We automatically detect sentence boundaries when they are not provided, and parse all corpora with the 6-split Berkeley Parser.",
        "As in previous NLI work, we then replace all word tokens that do not occur in a list of 614 common words with an unknown word symbol, UNK.",
        "While these are standard data preprocessing steps, from our experience with this problem we propose additional practical considerations.",
        "First, we filter the parsed corpora, retaining only sentences that are",
        "parsed to a Clause Level2 tag.",
        "This is primarily due to the fact that automatic sentence boundary detectors must be used on the ICLE, Lang8, and FCE data sets, and false positives lead to sentence fragments that are parsed as NP, VP, FRAG, etc.",
        "The wild internet text found in the Lang8 data set alo yields many non-Clause Level parses from non-English text or emotive punctuation.",
        "Sentence detection false negatives, on the other hand, lead to run-on sentences, and so we additionally remove sentences with more than 40 words.",
        "We also impose a simple preprocessing step for better treatment of proper nouns.",
        "Due to the geographic distribution of languages, the proper nouns used in a writer's text naturally present a strong L1 signal.",
        "The obvious remedy is to replace all proper nouns with UNK, but this is unfortunately insufficient as the structure of the proper noun itself can be a covert signal of these geographical trends.",
        "To fix this, we also remove all proper noun left sisters of proper nouns.",
        "We choose to retain the rightmost sister node in order to preserve the plurality of the noun phrase, as the rightmost noun is most likely the lexical head.",
        "From these parsed, UNKed, and filtered corpora we draw 2500 sentences from each L1 background at random, for a total of 10000 sentences per corpus.",
        "The exception is the FCE corpus, from which we draw 1500 sentences per L1 due to its small size."

        "Related NLI work compares a plethora of suggested feature sets, ranging from character n-grams to latent topic activations to labeled dependency arcs, but TSG rules are best able to represent complex lexical and syntactic behavior in a homogeneous feature type.",

        "than cover linguistic phenomena (Johnson, 2012); while features such as character n-grams, POS tag sequences, and CFG rules may provide a usable L1 signal, each feature is likely covering some component of a pattern instead of capturing it in full.",
        "TSG rules, on the other hand, offer remarkable flexibility in the patterns that they can represent, potentially capturing any contiguous parse tree structure.",
        "As it is intractable to rank and filter the entire set of possible TSG rules given a corpus, we start with the large subset produced by Bayesian grammar induction.",
        "The most widely used algorithm for TSG induction uses a Dirichlet Process to choose a subset of frequently reoccurring rules by repeatedly sampling derivations for a corpus of parse trees (Cohn and Blunsom, 2010).",

        "However, this same property makes rare rules harder to find.",
        "To address this weakness, we define a general model for TSG induction in labeled documents that combines a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (Teh et al. 2005), with supervised labels in a manner similar to upstream supervised LDA (Mimno and McCallum, 2008).",

        "Using these methods, we produce a list of L1 associated TSG rules that we release for public use.",
        "We perform grammar induction using model M3, apply our data dependence and redundancy filters, rank for relevancy using ?2 and filter at the level of p < .1 statistical significance for relevancy.",
        "Each entry consists of a TSG rule and its matrix of counts with each ?.",
        "We provide the total for each L1 label, which shows the overall prediction of the proportional use of that item.",
        "We also provide the ?2 statistics for L1 dependence and the dependence of L1 and corpus.",
        "It is speculative to assign causes to the discriminative rules we report, and we leave quantification of such statements to future work.",
        "However, the strength of the signal, as evidenced by actual counts in data, and the high level interpretation that can be easily assigned to the TSG rules is promising.",
        "As understanding the features requires basic knowledge of Treebank symbols, we provide our interpretations for some of the more interesting rules and summarize their L1 distributions.",
        "Note that by describing a rule as being preferred by a certain set of L1 labels, our claim is relative to the other labels only; the true cause could also be a dispreference in the complement of this set.",
        "One interesting comparison made easy by our method is the identification of similar structures that have complementary L1 usage.",
        "An example is the use of a prepositional phrase just before the first noun phrase in a sentence, which is preferred in German and Spanish, especially in the former.",
        "However, German speakers disprefer a prepositional phrase followed by a comma at the beginning of the sentence, and Chinese speakers use this pattern more frequently than the other L1s.",
        "Another contrastable pair is the use of the word ?because?",
        "with upper or lower case, signifying sentence initial or medial use.",
        "The former is preferred in Chinese and Japanese text, while the latter is preferred in German and even more so in Spanish L1 data.",
        "As these examples suggest, the data shows a strong division of preference between European and Asian languages, but many patterns exist that are uniquely preferred in single languages as well.",
        "Japanese speakers are seen to frequently use a personal pronoun as the subject of the sentence, while Spanish speakers use the phrase ?the X of Y?, the verb ?go?, and the determiner ?this?",
        "with markedly higher frequency.",
        "Germans tend to begin sentences with adverbs, and various modal verb constructions are popular with Chinese speakers.",
        "We suspect these patterns to be evidence of preference in the specified language, rather than dispreference in the other three.",
        "Our strategy in regard to the hard filters for L1-corpus dependence and redundancy has been to prefer recall to precision, as false positives can be easily ignored through subsequent inspection of the data we supply.",
        "This makes the list suitable for human qualitative analysis, but further work is required for its use in downstream automatic systems."

        "This work contributes to the goal of leveraging NLI data in SLA applications.",
        "We provide evidence for",
        "our hypothesis that relevancy metrics based on mutual information are ill-suited for this task, and recommend the use of the ?2 statistic for rejecting the hypothesis of language independence.",
        "Explicit controls for dependence between L1 and corpus are proposed, and redundancy between features are addressed as well.",
        "We argue for the use of TSG rules as features, and develop an induction algorithm that is a supervised mixture of hierarchical grammars.",
        "This generalizable formalism is used to capture linguistic assumptions about the data and increase the amount of relevant features extracted at several thresholds.",
        "This project motivates continued incorporation of more data and induction of TSGs over these larger data sets.",
        "This will improve the quality and scope of the resulting list of discriminative syntax, allowing broader use in linguistics and SLA research.",
        "The prospect of high precision and recall in the extraction of such patterns suggests several interesting avenues for future work, such as determination of the actual language transfer phenomena evidenced by an arbitrary count profile.",
        "To achieve the goal of automatic detection of plausible transfer the native languages themselves must be considered, as well as a way to distinguish between preference and dispreference based on usage statistics.",
        "Another exciting application of such a refined list of patterns is the automatic integration of its features in L1 targeted"
