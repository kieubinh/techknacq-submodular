        "training sentences in the primary treebank and keeping the size of the supporting treebank constant.",
        "In order to highlight the differences between the three adaptation methods, we show error reduction plots in Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5 for German, Swedish, Italian, and English respectively.",
        "For each training set size on the x axis, the plot shows the reduction in relative error with respect to the baseline.",
        "We note that every single one of the 24 adapted parsers learns faster than the corresponding baseline parser.",
        "While we saw a number of significant improvements in ?3.3 when using the full training sets, the relative improvements are much stronger when the training sets are small-and medium-sized.",
        "These plots illustrate the different properties of the two methods.",
        "Using a shared feature representation tends to be very effective when the primary treebank is small: the error reductions are over 40 percent for German and over 25 percent for English.",
        "Guided parsing works best for mid-sized sets, and the relative effectiveness of both methods decreases as the size of the primary treebank increases.",
        "Again, we see that guided parsing is less effective if the guide uses an annotation style that is hard to parse.",
        "In particular, for Swedish the Syntag parser never gives a very large improvement when guiding the Talbanken parser, and this is also true of both Italian parsers.",
        "To a smaller extent, this also holds for English and German: the WSJ Part 2 and Tiger parsers are less useful as guides than their counterparts.",
        "The combination method generally performs very well: in all eight experiments, it outperforms the other two for almost every training set size.",
        "Its performance is very close to that of the guided parsing method for larger training sets, when the effect of the shared features method is less pronounced."

      "text": [
        "We have considered the problem of training a dependency parser on incompatible treebanks, and we studied two very simple methods for addressing this problem, the shared features and guided parsing methods.",
        "These methods allow us to use more than one treebank when training dependency parsers.",
        "We evaluated the methods on eight treebanks in four languages, and had statistically significant improvements in all eight cases.",
        "In particular, for English we saw a strong 1.2-point absolute improvement (an 11% relative error reduction) in the performance of a semantically oriented parser when trained on the full training set.",
        "For German, we also had very strong results for the Tiger treebank: a 6% error reduction.",
        "For Swedish, the parser trained on the small Syntag treebank got a boost from a guide parser trained on the larger Talbanken.",
        "In general, it seems to be easier to improve parsers that use representations that are harder to parse.",
        "For all eight treebanks, both methods achieved large improvements for small training set sizes, while the effect gradually diminished as the training set size increased.",
        "The shared features method was the most effective for very small training sets, while guided parsing surpassed it when training sets got larger.",
        "The combination of the twomethods was also effective, in most cases outperforming both methods on their own.",
        "In particular, when using the full training sets, this was the only method that had statistically significant improvements for all treebanks.",
        "While this work used an unlabeled graph-based dependency parser, our methods generalize naturally to other parsing approaches, including transition-based dependency parsing.",
        "Labeled parsing with incompatible label sets is easy to implement in the shared features framework by removing the label information from the shared feature representation fs, and similar modifications of fs could be carried out to handle more complex situations such as combined constituent and dependency parsing.",
        "Furthermore, the paths used by the feature extractor in the guided parser can be extended without much effort as well.",
        "The models presented here are very simple, and in future work we would like to explore more complex approaches such as quasi-synchronous grammars (Smith and Eisner, 2009; Li et al., 2012) or automatic treebank transformation (Niu et al., 2009)."
