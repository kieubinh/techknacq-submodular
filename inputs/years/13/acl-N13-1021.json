        "By instead training on ASR transcripts, these methods can automatically capture some regularities of lexical variants and their common realizations by the recognizer.",
        "Additionally, evidence of acoustic confusability is available in word lattice output from the recognizer, which can be exploited to yield more robust automatic scoring, particularly in high error-rate scenarios.",

        "We present results under a range of experimental conditions, including: variously adapting the ASR models to the domain; using maximum entropy models rather than CRFs; differing tagsets (BIO versus IO); and with varying degrees of supervision.",
        "Finally, we demonstrate improved utility in terms of using the automatic scores to classify elderly individuals as having Mild Cognitive Impairment.",

        "Each of the individuals producing retellings in our corpus underwent a battery of neuropsychological tests, and were assigned a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) (Morris, 1993), which is a composite score derived from measures of cognitive function in six domains, including memory.",
        "Importantly, it is assigned independently of the Wechsler Logical Memory test we are analyzing in this paper, which allows us to evaluate the utility of our WLM analyses in an unbiased manner.",
        "MCI is defined as a CDR of 0.5 (Ritchie and Touchon, 2000), and subjects in this study have either a CDR of 0 (no impairment) or 0.5 (MCI).",
        "In previous work, we found that the features extracted from the retellings are useful in distinguishing subjects with MCI from neurotypical age-matched controls (Lehr et al., 2012; Prud?hommeaux and Roark, 2012; Prud?hommeaux and Roark, 2011).",
        "From each retellings, we extract Boolean features for each story element, for a total of 50 features for classification.",
        "Each feature indicates whether the retelling contained that story element.",
        "In this paper, we carry out similar classification experiments to investigate the impact of using log-linear models on the extraction of features for classification.",
        "We build a support vector machine (SVM) using the LibSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011) extension to the WEKA data mining Java API (Hall et al., 2009).",
        "This allows recollection of different elements to be weighted differently.",
        "This is unlike the manual scoring of WLM based on clinical guidelines where all elements are weighted equally irrespective of the difficulty.",
        "The SVM was trained on manually extracted story element feature vectors.",
        "We compared the performance of the MCI classification for three types of input and four ASR configurations under the supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid scenarios.",
        "For each scenario we chose the best scoring system from among the automated systems reported in Tables 4 and 5.",
        "Classification results, evaluated as area under the curve (AUC), are reported in Table 6, both for the log-linear trained tagging models and for the baseline word-alignment based method.",
        "For reference (not shown in the table), the SVM classifier performed at 0.83 when features values are manually populated.",
        "The results show that the AUC improves steadily as the quality of the transcription is improved, going from the baseline system to the adapted models.",
        "This is consistent with the improvements seen in the F-score for detecting story elements.",
        "The different approaches for detecting the story elements from the transcriptions did not ultimately show significant differences in MCI classification results.",
        "Overall, the best classification values are given by the hybrid approach, which performs slightly better than the other two approaches.",
        "The best AUC in the hybrid scenario (0.79, very close to the AUC=0.81 achieved with manual transcripts) is obtained with a CRF trained with WCNs from the fully adapted ASR model and with context dependent features and BIO tags.",
        "Comparing WCN versus 1-best as inputs, using WCN as input improves classification performance when the 1-best transcripts are poor, as in the case of out-of-domain ASR.",
        "The adapted recognizer improves the performance of the 1-best significantly making it unnecessary to resort to WCN as inputs.",
        "Comparing the MaxEnt model with CRF model",
        "for extracting story elements, we see that the average F-scores for the MaxEnt models trained on CD features are nearly as good as and sometimes slightly better than those produced using the CRF models.",
        "The CRF extracted story elements, however, tend to yield classifiers that perform slightly better, especially in the unsupervised approach with 1-best inputs."

        "This paper examines the task of automatically scoring narrative retellings in terms of their fidelity to the original narrative content, using discriminatively trained log-linear tagging models.",
        "Fully automatic scoring must account for both lexical variation and acoustic confusion from ASR errors.",
        "Lexical variation ?",
        "due to extensive paraphrasing on the part of the individuals retelling the narrative ?",
        "can be modeled effectively using word-alignment models such as those employed in machine translation systems (Lehr et al., 2012; Prud?hommeaux and Roark, 2011).",
        "This paper focuses on an alternative approach, where both lexical variation and ASR confusions are modeled using log-linear models.",
        "In addition to very flexible feature definitions, the log-linear models bring the advantage of a discriminative model to the task.",
        "We see improvements in story element F-score using these models over unsupervised word-alignment models.",
        "Further, the feature definition flexibility allows us to incorporate the unsupervised word-alignment labels into these models, resulting either in fully unsupervised approaches that perform competitively with the supervised models or in hybrid (supervised) approaches that provide the best performing systems in this study.",
        "Our tagging models are able to process word confusion networks as inputs and thus improve performance over using 1-best ASR transcripts in scenarios where the speech recognition error rate is high.",
        "These improvements carry through to the MCI classification task, making use of features computed from the automatic scoring of narrative retelling.",
        "One advantage of the word-alignment model is that such approaches do not require manual annotation of the story elements, which is more labor intensive than typical manual transcription of speech.",
        "Thus, the word-alignment model can exploit large numbers of retellings in an unsupervised manner when trained on ASR transcripts of the retellings.",
        "Controlled experiments here with relatively limited training sets demonstrate that semi-supervised approaches on larger untranscribed sets are likely to be successful.",
        "Finally, experiments with different amounts of ASR adaptation show that both acoustic and language model adaptations in this domain are effective, yielding scenarios that are competitive with manual transcription both for detecting story elements as well as for subsequent classification.",
        "With full model adaptation to the domain, the 1-best transcripts improved significantly, and their performance was found to be at par with WCNs.",
        "In future work, we would like to investigate two questions left open by these results.",
        "First, word-alignment models can be extended to process ASR lattices or word confusion networks as part of the unsupervised alignment learning algorithm, and incorporated into our approach.",
        "Second, the contextual features can be refined (e.g., concatenated features instead of smoothed features) when large amounts of training data is available.",
        "It is noteworthy to mention that the lexical variants and paraphrasing learned from the data using automated method may be useful in refining the clinical guidelines for scoring (e.g., allowing additional lexical variants and paraphrasings, or assigning unequal credits for different story elements to reflect the difficulty of recollecting them) or to create the guidelines for new languages or stories."
