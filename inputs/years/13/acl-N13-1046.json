        "Translation of named entities (NEs) is important for NLP applications such as Machine Translation (MT) and Cross-lingual Information Retrieval.",
        "For MT, NEs are major subset of the out-of-vocabulary terms (OOVs).",
        "Due to their diversity, they cannot always be found in parallel corpora, dictionaries or gazetteers.",
        "Thus, state-of-the-art of MT needs to handle NEs in specific ways.",
        "For instance, in the English-Arabic automatic translation example given in Figure 1, the noun ?North?",
        "has been erroneously translated to ?",
        "?J ?A?",
        "??",
        "@ /Al$mAlyp ?",
        "(indicating the north direction in English) instead of being transliterated to ?",
        "HP?",
        "K / nwrv?.",
        "As shown in Figure 1, direct translation of in-vocabulary terms could degrade translation quality.",
        "Also blind transliteration of OOVs does not necessarily contribute to translation adequacy and may actually create noisy contexts for the language model and the decoder.",
        "An intelligent decision between translation and transliteration should use semantic and contextual information such as the type of the named-entity and the surrounding terms.",
        "In this paper, we construct and evaluate a classification-based framework to automate the translation vs. transliteration decision.",
        "We evaluate our classifier both in the limited news and diverse Wikipedia domains, and achieve promising accuracy.",
        "Moreover, we conduct an extrinsic evaluation of the classifier within an English to Arabic MT system.",
        "In an in-domain (news) MT task, the classifier contributes to a modest (yet significant) improvement in MT quality.",
        "Moreover, for a Wikipedia translation task, we demonstrate that our classifier can reduce the erroneous translation of 60.5% of the named entities.",
        "In summary our contributions are: (a) We automatically construct a bilingual lexicon of NEs paired with the transliteration/translation decisions in two domains.1 (b) We build a binary classifier for transliteration and translation decision with a promising accuracy (c) We demonstrate its utility",

        "Starting with a word aligned parallel corpus, we use the UIUC NE tag-ger (Ratinov and Roth, 2009) to tag the English sentences with four classes of NEs: Person (PER), Location (LOC), Organization (ORG) and Miscellaneous (MISC).",
        "Furthermore, we use the word alignments to project and collect the span of the associated Arabic named-entities.",
        "To reduce the noisy nature of word alignments, we designed a procedure to clean up the noisy Arabic NE spans by POS verification, and heuristically filtering impossible items (e.g. verbs).",
        "This results in a bilingual lexicon of about 57K named-entity pairs.",
        "The distribution of NEs categories is reported in Table 1.",
        "To train and evaluate the Cdiverse classifier, we expand our labeled data with Wikipedia NEs using the cross-lingual hyperlinks.",

        "We improve the Arabic-English Wikipedia title lexicon of Mohit et al. (2012) and build a Wikipedia exclusive lexicon with 4K bilingual entities.",
        "In order to test the domain effects, our lexicon includes only NEs which are not present in the parallel corpus.",
        "The statistics given in Table 1 demonstrate different nature of the labeled datasets.",
        "The two datasets were labeled semi-automatically using the transliteration similarity measure (Frscore) proposed by Freeman et al.",
        "(2006), a variant of edit distance measuring the similarity between an English word and its Arabic transliteration.",
        "In our experiments, English tokens having an Frscore > 0.6 are considered as transliteration, others having Frscore < 0.5 as translation.",
        "These thresholds were determined after tuning with a held out development set.",
        "For tokens having Frscore between 0.5 and 0.6, the decision is not obvious.",
        "To label these instances (around 5K unique tokens), we manually transliterate them using Microsoft Maren tool.3 We again compute the Frscore between the obtained transliteration, in its Buckwal-ter form and the corresponding English token and use the same threshold to distinguish between the two classes.",
