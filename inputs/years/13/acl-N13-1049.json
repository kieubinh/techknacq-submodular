        "Collections of manually-annotated morphological and syntactic analyses of sentences, or treebanks, are an important resource for building statistical parsing models or for syntax-aware approaches to applications such as machine translation.",
        "Rich treebank annotations have also been used for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) applications such as tokenization, diacritization, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, morphological disambiguation, base phrase chunking, and semantic role labeling.",
        "The development of a treebank with rich annotations is demanding in time and money, especially for morphologically complex languages.",
        "Consequently, the richer the annotation, the slower the annotation process and the smaller the size of the treebank.",
        "As such, a tradeoff is usually made between the size of the treebank and the richness of its annotations.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the possibility of automatically enriching the morphologically underspecified Columbia Arabic Treebank (CATiB) (Habash and Roth, 2009; Habash et al., 2009) with the more complex POS tags and lemmas used in the Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB) (Maamouri et al., 2004).",
        "We employ a variety of techniques that range from corpus-based statistical models to handwritten rules based on linguistic observations.",
        "Our best method reaches accuracy rates of 94%-95% on full POS tag identification.",
        "We can also identify the unspecified lemmas in CATiB with an accuracy over 97%.",
        "37% of our POS tag errors are due to gold tree or gold POS errors.",
        "A learning curve experiment to evaluate the dependence of our method on annotated data shows that while the quality of some components may reduce sharply with less data (12% absolute reduction in accuracy when using 132 of the dataor some 10K annotated words), the overall effect is a lot smaller (2% absolute drop).",
        "These results suggest that the cost of treebanking can be reduced by designing underspecified treebanks that can be subsequently enriched automatically.",
        "The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents related work; Section 3 details various language background facts about Arabic and its treebanking; Section 4 explains our approach; and Section 5 presents and discusses our results."

        "Arabic Treebanking There has been a lot work on building treebanks for different languages.",
        "In the case of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), there are three efforts that vary in terms of richness and representation choice.",
        "The Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB) (Maamouri et al., 2004; Maamouri et al., 2009b; Maamouri et al., 2009a), the Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank (PADT) (Smr?",
        "and Ha-jic?, 2006; Smr?",
        "et al, 2008) and the Columbia Arabic Treebank (CATiB) (Habash and Roth, 2009; Habash et al., 2009) .",
        "The PATB uses phrase structure representation, while the other two use two",
        "different dependency representations.",
        "The PATB and PADT representations are quite detailed.",
        "The PATB not only provides tokenization, complex POS tags (485 tags in our data set), and syntactic structure; it also provides empty categories, diacritization, lemma choices, glosses and some semantic tags.",
        "In comparison CATiB only provides tokenization, six POS tags and eight dependency relations.",
        "The tradeoff is speed: CATiB's complete POS and syntax annotation rate is 540 tokens/hour (and annotator training takes two months), a much higher speed than reported for complete (POS and syntax) annotation in PATB (around 250-300 tokens/hour and 6-12 months for annotator training) and PADT (around 75 tokens/hour) (Habash and Roth, 2009).",
        "An important recent addition to the family of Arabic treebanks is the Quran Treebank, which targets the Classical Arabic language of the Quran, not MSA (Dukes and Buckwalter, 2010).",
        "Treebank Enrichment There has been a number of efforts on developing treebanks with rich representations and on treebank enrichment for many languages, such Danish, English, German, Italian and Spanish (Oepen et al., 2002; Hinrichs et al., 2004; M?ller, 2010).",
        "Additionally, there has been some work on Arabic treebank enrichment that built on the PATB by manually extending its already rich annotations or automatically converting them to new formalisms.",
        "The Arabic Propbank (Propositional Bank) (Palmer et al., 2008) and the OntoNotes project (Hovy et al., 2006) both annotate for Arabic semantic information.",
        "Alkuhlani and Habash (2011) add annotations marking functional gender and number, and rationality; and Abdul-Mageed and Diab (2012) annotate the sentence level with sentiment labels.",
        "Tounsi et al. (2009) automatically converted the PATB to a lexical functional grammar (LFG) representation.",
        "Similarly, Habash and Roth (2009) used a similar technique to build an initial version of CATiB.",
        "We use this CATiB version of PATB to evaluate our approach in this paper.",
        "Also related to this is the work on automatic enrichment of specific features, e.g., Habash et al. (2007a) demonstrated that nominal case, can be determined for gold syntactic analyses at high accuracy.",
        "We replicate their results and improve upon them.",
        "And unlike them, we handle all the morphological features in the PATB, not just case.",
        "Morphological Disambiguation There has been a lot of work on Arabic POS tagging and morphological disambiguation (Diab et al., 2004; Habash and Rambow, 2005; Smith et al., 2005; Hajic?",
        "et al, 2005; Roth et al., 2008; Habash et al., 2013).",
        "These approaches are intended to apply to raw text and determine the appropriate in-context morphological reading for each word.",
        "In contrast, in this paper, we are starting from a partially disambiguated and relatively rich representation: we have tokenization, general POS tags and syntactic dependency information.",
        "Finally, morphological information (beyond tokenization) has been shown to be useful for many NLP applications.",
        "Marton et al. (2011) demonstrated that morphology helps Arabic parsing.",
        "Using morphological features such as case has also improved parsing for Russian, Turkish and Hindi (Nivre et al., 2008; Eryigit et al., 2008; Nivre, 2009).",
        "Other work has shown value for morphology in the context of Arabic named entity recognition (Bena-jiba et al., 2009).",
        "These results support the value of our goal of enriching resources with morphological information, which then can be used to improve different NLP applications."
