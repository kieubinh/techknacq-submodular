        "Consumer's purchase decisions are increasingly influenced by user-generated online reviews of products and services (Cone, 2011).",

        "fictitious reviews that have been deliberately written to sound authentic and deceive the reader (Ott et al., 2011).",
        "For example, Ott et al. (2012) has estimated that between 1% and 6% of positive hotel reviews appear to be deceptive, suggesting that some hotels may be posting fake positive reviews in order to hype their own offerings.",
        "In this work we distinguish between two kinds of deceptive opinion spam, depending on the sentiment expressed in the review.",
        "In particular, reviews intended to promote or hype an offering, and which therefore express a positive sentiment towards the offering, are called positive deceptive opinion spam.",
        "In contrast, reviews intended to disparage or slander competitive offerings, and which therefore express a negative sentiment towards the offering, are called negative deceptive opinion spam.",
        "While previous related work (Ott et al., 2011; Ott et al., 2012) has explored characteristics of positive deceptive opinion spam, the complementary problem of negative deceptive opinion spam remains largely unstudied.",
        "Following the framework of Ott et al. (2011), we use Amazon's Mechanical Turk service to produce the first publicly available1 dataset of negative deceptive opinion spam, containing 400 gold standard deceptive negative reviews of 20 popular Chicago hotels.",
        "To validate the credibility of our deceptive reviews, we show that human deception detection performance on the negative reviews is low, in agreement with decades of traditional deception detection research (Bond and DePaulo, 2006).",
        "We then show that standard n-gram text categorization techniques can be used to detect negative deceptive opinion spam with approximately 86% accuracy ?",

        "surpassing that of the human judges.",
        "In conjunction with Ott et al. (2011)'s positive deceptive opinion spam dataset, we then explore the interaction between sentiment and deception with respect to three types of language features: (1) changes in first-person singular use, often attributed to psychological distancing (Newman et al., 2003), (2) decreased spatial awareness and more narrative form, consistent with theories of reality monitoring (Johnson and Raye, 1981) and imaginative writing (Biber et al., 1999; Rayson et al., 2001), and (3) increased negative emotion terms, often attributed to leakage cues (Ekman and Friesen, 1969), but perhaps better explained in our case as an exaggeration of the underlying review sentiment."

        "In particular, if human detection performance is found to be very high, then it would cast doubt on the usefulness of the Mechanical Turk approach for soliciting gold standard deceptive opinion spam.",

        "For example, fake positive reviews included less spatial language (e.g., floor, small, location, etc.)",
        "because individuals who had not actually experienced the hotel simply had less spatial detail available for their review (Johnson and Raye, 1981).",
        "This was also the case for our negative reviews, with less spatial language observed for fake negative reviews relative to truthful.",

        "quent, according to LIWC (Pennebaker et al., 2007), in our fake negative reviews than in the fake positive reviews.",
        "But, importantly, the fake negative reviewers overproduced negative emotion terms (e.g., terrible, disappointed) relative to the truthful reviews in the same way that fake positive reviewers overproduced positive emotion terms (e.g., elegant, luxurious).",
        "Combined, these data suggest that the more frequent negative emotion terms in the present dataset are not the result of ?leakage cues?",
        "that reveal the emotional distress of lying (Ekman and Friesen, 1969).",
        "Instead, the differences suggest that fake hotel reviewers exaggerate the sentiment they are trying to convey relative to similarly-valenced truthful reviews.",
        "Second, the effect of deception on the pattern of pronoun frequency was not the same across positive and negative reviews.",
        "In particular, while first person singular pronouns were produced more frequently in fake reviews than truthful, consistent with the case for positive reviews, the increase was diminished in the negative reviews examined here.",
        "In the positive reviews reported by Ott et al. (2011), the rate of first person singular in fake reviews (M=4.36%, SD=2.96%) was twice the rate observed in truthful reviews (M=2.18%, SD=2.04%).",
        "In contrast, the rate of first person singular in the deceptive negative reviews (M=4.47%, SD=2.83%) was only 57% greater than for truthful reviews (M=2.85%, SD=2.23%).",
        "These results suggest that the emphasis on the self, perhaps as a strategy of convincing the reader that the author had actually been to the hotel, is not as evident in the fake negative reviews, perhaps because the negative tone of the reviews caused the reviewers to psychologically distance themselves from their negative statements, a phenomenon observed in several other deception studies, e.g., Hancock et al.

        "We have created the first publicly-available corpus of gold standard negative deceptive opinion spam, containing 400 reviews of 20 Chicago hotels, which we have used to compare the deception detection capabilities of untrained human judges and standard n-gram?based Support Vector Machine classifiers.",
        "Our results demonstrate that while human deception detection performance is greater for negative rather than positive deceptive opinion spam, the best detection performance is still achieved through automated classifiers, with approximately 86% accuracy.",
        "We have additionally explored, albeit briefly, the relationship between sentiment and deception by utilizing Ott et al. (2011)'s positive deceptive opinion spam dataset in conjunction with our own.",
        "In particular, we have identified several features of language that seem to remain consistent across sentiment, such as decreased awareness of spatial details and exaggerated language.",
        "We have also identified other features that vary with the sentiment, such as first person singular use, although further work is required to determine if these differences may be exploited to improve deception detection performance.",
        "Indeed, future work may wish to jointly model sentiment and deception in order to better determine the effect each has on language use."
