        "The Ethnologue organization1 lists 6,809 distinct languages in the world, most of which are resource-poor.",

        "There are languages for which we are lucky to find a single bilingual dictionary online.",
        "For example, the University of Chicago hosts bilingual dictionaries from 29 Southeast Asian languages2, but many of these languages have only one bilingual dictionary online.",
        "Existing algorithms for creating new bilingual dictionaries use intermediate languages or intermediate dictionaries to find chains of words with the same meaning.",
        "For example, (Gollins and Sanderson, 2001) use lexical triangulation to translate in parallel across multiple intermediate languages and",
        "fuse the results.",
        "They query several existing dictionaries and then merge results to maximize accuracy.",
        "They use four pivot languages, German, Spanish, Dutch and Italian, as intermediate languages.",
        "Another existing approach for creating bilingual dictionaries is using probabilistic inference (Mausam et al., 2010).",
        "They organize dictionaries in a graph topology and use random walks and probabilistic graph sampling.",
        "(Shaw et al., 2011) propose a set of algorithms to create a reverse dictionary in the context of single language by using converse mapping.",
        "In particular, given an English-English dictionary, they attempt to find the original words or terms given a synonymous word or phrase describing the meaning of a word.",
        "The goal of this research is to study the feasibility of creating a reverse dictionary by using only one existing dictionary and Wordnet lexical ontology.",
        "For example, given a Karbi3-English dictionary, we will construct an ENG-AJZ dictionary.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we discuss the nature of bilingual dictionaries.",
        "Section 3 describes the algorithms we propose to create new bilingual dictionaries from existing dictionaries.",
        "Results of our experiments are presented in Section 4.",
