        "Respellings are a widely employed method of conveying the pronunciation of English and foreign words, both in print and on the Web.",
        "For example, Huatulco, the name of a Mexican resort, is respelled as ?wah-tool-koh?",
        "in a travel guide (Noble, 2012).",
        "The advantage of using respellings lies in removing the need for a separately defined phonetic transcription system.",
        "Since they contain only the letters of the Latin alphabet, their phonetic interpretation relies exclusively on orthographic intuitions of readers.",
        "For this reason, respellings are widely used in travel phrase books, medical compendia, and drug name pronunciation guides, among others.",
        "Despite their utility, good respellings are not easy to create.",
        "Respellings found on the Web often contain errors or ambiguities.",
        "For example, HenochSchoenlein purpura, a skin disease, is respelled both as ?heh-nok shoon-line purr-puh-ruh?",
        "and ?hen-awk sher-line purr-purr-ah?.",
        "Does ?heh?",
        "rhyme with eh [e] or with Nineveh [@], or is it the same vowel as in hen [E]?",
        "Clearly, if both respellings refer to the same pronunciation, at least one of them must be wrong.",
        "In addition, converting the pronunciation of a foreign name to English phonemes is in itself a non-trivial task.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the task of generating respellings from the intended pronunciation given as a sequence of phonemes.",
        "We develop a standalone system that combines linguistic knowledge and resources with machine learning models trained on data mined from the Web and electronic dictionaries.",
        "One of our ultimate objectives is to aid writers by evaluating their respellings, improving them, or generating new candidates.",
        "Accordingly, we endeavour to maintain the generation and the evaluation stages as separate modules in our system.",
        "The evaluation of respellings is a challenging problem.",
        "Since English spelling conventions are notoriously inconsistent, there is no algorithm for accurately predicting the pronunciation of an out-of-vocabulary word.",
        "The current state-of-the-art letter-to-phoneme (L2P) converters are typically reported with 10-30% error rates on dictionary words (Bisani and Ney, 2008).",
        "On the other hand, human readers often disagree on the details of the pronunciation implied by a respelling.",
        "In this paper, we conduct two kinds of evaluations: an automated verification with an independent L2P system, and an experiment with human participants that pass judgments on different respellings of the same word.",
        "We interpret the results as evidence that the output of our system compares favourably with typical respellings found on the Web."

        "Some transcription schemes combine respellings with special symbols for representing certain phonemes.",
        "For example, an otherwise purely alphabetic Wikipedia scheme employs the symbol @ for the vowel schwa.",

        "In fact, Fraser (1997) identifies the schwa symbol as the cause of many pronunciation errors.",
        "In our system, we consistently use hyphens to segment multi-syllable respellings.",

        "simply as ?syllables?.",
        "syllable breaks.",
        "This approach has several advantages.",
        "First, individual syllables are easier to pronounce than an entire unfamiliar word.",
        "Second, hyphens limit the context that affects the pronunciation of a given letter (e.g. thin Beethoven ?baythoe-ven?).",
        "Finally, hyphens indicate whether adjacent vowel letters, such as oe in ?hoe?, represent one vowel phoneme or two.",
        "Some respellings explicitly indicate the stressed syllable by expressing it in a different font.",
        "This is potentially helpful because unstressed vowels tend to be reduced, which changes their pronunciation.",
        "However, since the vowel reduction phenomenon is by no means universal, the readers may be unsure whether to apply it to, e.g. the final o in ?KWAT-ro?.",
        "In this paper, we make no distinction between stressed and unstressed syllables; instead, we follow the principle that each syllable is to be pronounced as if it was a separate word.",

        "Nevertheless, it is entirely possible that different readers will derive different pronunciations from the same respelling.",
        "A respelling can be classified as unambiguous and yet incorrect by a given reader, but it cannot be judged as simultaneously ambiguous and correct.",
        "Indeed, an ambiguous respelling is compatible with at least two pronunciations, only one of which can be the intended pronunciation.",
