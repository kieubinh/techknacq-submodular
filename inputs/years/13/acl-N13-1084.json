        "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelop-mental disorder characterized by impaired communication and social behavior.",
        "Although the symptoms of ASD are numerous and varied, atypical and idiosyncratic language has been one of the core symptoms observed in verbal individuals with autism since Kanner first assigned a name to the disorder (Kanner, 1943).",
        "Atypical language currently serves as a diagnostic criterion in many of the most widely used diagnostic instruments for ASD (Lord et al., 2002; Rutter et al., 2003), and the phenomenon is especially marked in the areas of semantics and pragmatics (Tager-Flusberg, 2001; Volden and Lord, 1991).",
        "Because structured language assessment tools are not always sensitive to the particular atypical semantic and pragmatic expression associated with ASD, measures of atypical language are often drawn from spontaneous language samples.",
        "Expert manual annotation and analysis of spontaneous language in young people with ASD has revealed that children and young adults with autism include significantly more bizarre and irrelevant content (Loveland et al., 1990; Losh and Capps, 2003) in their narratives and more abrupt topic changes (Lam et al., 2012) in their conversations than their language-matched typically developing peers.",
        "Most normed clinical instruments for analyzing children's spontaneous language, however, focus on syntactic measures and developmental milestones related to the acquisition of vocabulary and syntactic structures.",
        "Measures of semantic and pragmatic atypicality in spontaneous language are rarely directly measured.",
        "Instead, the degree of language atypicality is often determined via subjective parental reports (e.g., asking a parent whether their child has ever used odd phrases (Rutter et al., 2003)) or general impressions during clinical examination (e.g., rating the child's degree of ?stereotyped or idiosyncratic use of words or phrases?",
        "on a four-point scale (Lord et al., 2002)).",
        "This has led to a lack of reliable and objective information about the frequency of atypical language use and its precise nature in ASD.",
        "In this study, we attempt to automatically detect instances of contextually atypical language in spontaneous speech at the lexical level in order to quantify its prevalence in the ASD population.",
        "We first determine manually the off-topic, surprising, or in",
        "appropriate words in a set of narrative retellings elicited in a clinical setting from children with ASD and typical development.",
        "We then apply word ranking methods and distributional semantic modeling to these narrative retellings in order to automatically identify these unexpected words.",
        "The results indicate not only that children with ASD do in fact produce more semantically unexpected and inappropriate words in their narratives than typically developing children but also that our automated methods for identifying these words are accurate enough to serve as an adequate substitute for manual annotation.",
        "Although unexpected off-topic word use is just one example of the atypical language observed in ASD, the work presented here highlights the potential of computational language evaluation and analysis methods for improving our understanding of the linguistic deficits associated with ASD."

        "ASD was diagnosed via clinical consensus according to the DSMIV-TR criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) and the established threshold scores on two diagnostic instruments: the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) (Lord et al., 2002), a semi-structured series of activities designed to allow an examiner to observe behaviors associated with autism; and the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) (Rutter et al., 2003), a parental questionnaire.",
        "None of the children in this study met the criteria for a language impairment, and there were no significant between-group differences in age (mean=6.4) or full-scale IQ (mean=114).",
        "The narrative retelling task analyzed here is the Narrative Memory subtest of the NEPSY (Korkman et al., 1998), a large and comprehensive battery of tasks that test neurocognitive functioning in children.",
        "The NEPSY Narrative Memory (NNM) subtest is a narrative retelling test in which the subject listens to a brief narrative, excerpts of which are shown in Figure 1, and then must retell the narrative to the examiner.",
        "The NNM was administered to each participant in the study, and each participant's retelling was recorded and transcribed.",
        "Using Amazon's Mechanical Turk, we also collected a large corpus of retellings from neurotypical adults, who listened to a recording of the story and provided written retellings.",
        "We describe how this corpus was used in Section 3, below.",
        "Two annotators, blind to the diagnosis of the experimental subjects, identified every word in each retelling transcript that was unexpected or inappropriate given the larger context of the story.",
        "For instance, in the sentence T-rex could smell things, both T-rex and smell were marked as unexpected, since there is no mention of either concept in the story.",

        "Before calculating the word association measures, we tokenize, downcase, and stem (Porter, 1980) the transcripts and remove all punctuation.",
        "We then use two association measures to score each word in each child's retelling: tf-idf, the term frequency-inverse document frequency measure (Salton and Buckley, 1988), and the log odds ratio (van Rijsbergen et al., 1981).",
        "We use the following formulation to calculate tf-idf for each child's retelling i and each word in that retelling j, where cij is the count of word j in retelling i; fj is the number of retellings from the full corpus of child and adult retellings containing that word j; and D is the total number of retellings in the full corpus (Manning et al., 2008):",
        "The log odds ratio, another association measure used in information retrieval and extraction tasks, is the ratio between the odds of a particular word, j, appearing in a child's retelling, i, as estimated using its relative frequency in that retelling, and the odds of that word appearing in all other retellings, again estimated using its relative frequency in all other retellings.",
        "Letting the probability of a word appearing in a retelling be p1 and the probability of that word appearing in all other retellings be p2, we can express the odds ratio as follows:",
        "A large tf-idf or log odds score indicates that the word j is very specific to the retelling i, which in turn suggests that the word might be unexpected or inappropriate in the larger context of the NNM narrative.",

        "Topic-specific words ought to occur much more frequently than other words.",
        "As a result, words with high tf-idf and log odds scores are likely to be those unrelated to the topic of the NNM story.",
        "If a child veers away from the topic of the NNM story and uses words that do not occur frequently in the retellings produced by neurotypical speakers, his retellings will contain more words with high word association scores.",
        "We predict that this set of high-scoring words is likely to overlap significantly with the set of words identified by the manual annotators as unexpected or off-topic.",

        "This work underscores the potential of automated techniques for improving our understanding of the prevalence and diagnostic utility of linguistic features associated with ASD and other communication and language disorders.",
        "In future work, we plan to use a development set to determine the optimal number of topical words to select during the topic estimate filtering stage of the pipeline in order to maintain improvements in precision without a loss in recall.",
        "We would also like to investigate using part-of-speech, word sense, and parse information to improve our approaches for both semantic expansion and topic estimation.",
        "Although the rate of unexpected word use alone is unlikely to provide sufficient power to classify the two diagnostic groups investigated here, we expect that it can serve as one feature in an array of features that capture the broad range of semantic and pragmatic atypicalities observed in the spoken language of children with autism.",
        "Finally, we plan to apply these same methods to identify the confabulations and topic shifts often observed in the narrative retellings of the elderly with neurodegenerative conditions."
