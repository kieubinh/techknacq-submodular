        "In the context of RE, there is not much work that aims to exploit the scope of negations.",
        "The only work on RE that we are aware of is Sanchez-Graillet and Poesio (2007) where they used various heuristics to extract negative protein interaction.",

        "Simply considering whether a pair of candidate mentions falls under the scope of a negation cue might not be helpful.",
        "In this paper, we propose that the scope of negations can be exploited at two different levels.",
        "Firstly, the system would check whether all the target entity3 mentions inside a sentence along with possible relation clues (or trigger words), if any, fall (directly or indirectly) under the scope of a negation cue.",
        "If such a sentence is found, then it should be discarded (i.e. candidate mention pairs4 inside that sentence would not be considered).",
        "Secondly, for each of the remaining pairs of candidate mentions, the system should exploit features related to the scope of negation (rather than simply adding a feature for negation cue, approach adopted in various RE systems) that can provide indication (if any such evidence exists) that the corresponding relation of interest actually does not hold in that particular context.",
        "In the subsequent sections, we describe our approach.",
        "The RE task considered is drug-drug interaction (DDI) extraction.",
        "The task has significant importance for public health safety.5 We used",
