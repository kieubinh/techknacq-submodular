        "Online learning, a new trend in distance learning, provides numerous lectures to students all over the world.",

        "Starting from video recordings of lectures which sometimes also come with the presentation material, a set of processes can be applied to extract information from the unstructured data to assist students in browsing, searching and understanding the content of the lecture.",
        "These processes include automatic speech recognition (ASR) which converts the audio to text, lecture segmentation which inserts paragraph boundaries and adds section titles to the lecture transcriptions, automatic summarization that generates a short summary from",
        "the full lecture, and lecture translation that translates the lecture from the original language to the native language of the student.",
        "The transcription of a lecture generated by the ASR system is a sequence of words which does not contain any structural information such as paragraph, section boundaries and section titles.",
        "Zhang et al. (2007; 2008; 2010) used acoustic and linguistic features for rhetorical structure detection and summarization.",
        "They showed that linguistic features such as TF-IDF are the most influential in segmentation and summarization and that knowing the structure of a lecture can significantly improve the performance of lecture summarization.",
        "Our experiments with a real-time lecture translation system also show that displaying the rolling translation results of a live lecture with proper paragraphing and inserted section titles makes it easier for students to grasp the key points during a lecture.",
        "In this paper, we apply existing algorithms, namely the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (Gales and Young, 2007) to unstructured lecture transcription to infer the underlying structure for better lecture segmentation and summarization.",
        "HMM has been successfully applied in early works (van Mul-bregt et al., 1998; Sherman and Liu, 2008) for text segmentation, event tracking and boundary detection.",
        "The focus of this work is to identify cue words and phrases that are good indicators of lecture structure.",
        "Intuitively, words and phrases such as ?last week we talked about?, ?this is an outline of my talk?, ?now I am going to talk about?, ?in conclusion?, and ?any questions?",
        "should be important features to recognize lecture structure.",
        "These words/phrases, however, may not be so important content-wise.",
        "Thus, content-driven metrics such as the TF-IDF score usually do not assign higher weights to these structurally important words/phrases.",
