        "In recent years, much research has been conducted into developing automated assessment systems to automatically score spontaneous speech from non-native speakers with the goals of reducing the burden on human raters, improving reliability, and generating feedback that can be used by language learners.",
        "Various features related to different aspects of speaking proficiency have been exploited, such as delivery features for pronunciation, prosody, and fluency (Strik and Cucchiarini, 1999; Chen et al., 2009; Cheng, 2011; Higgins et al., 2011), as well as language use features for vocabulary and grammar, and content features (Chen and Zechner, 2011; Xie et al., 2012).",
        "However, discourse-level features related to topic development have rarely been investigated in the context of automated speech scoring.",
        "This is despite the fact that an important criterion in the human scoring rubrics for speaking assessments is the evaluation of coherence, which refers to the conceptual relations between different units within a response.",
        "Methods for automatically assessing discourse coherence in text documents have been widely studied in the context of applications such as natural language generation, document summarization, and assessment of text readability.",
        "For example, Foltz et al. (1998) measured the overall coherence of a text by utilizing Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to calculate the semantic relatedness between adjacent sentences.",
        "Barzilay and Lee (2004) introduced an HMM-based model for the document-level analysis of topics and topic transitions.",
        "Barzilay and Lapata (2005; 2008) presented an approach to coherence modeling which focused on the entities in the text and their grammatical transitions between adjacent sentences, and calculated the entity transition probabilities on the document level.",
        "Pitler et al. (2010) provided a summary of the performance of several different types of features for automated coherence evaluation, such as cohesive devices, adjacent sentence similarity, Coh-Metrix (Graesser et al., 2004), word co-occurrence patterns, and entity-grid.",
        "In addition to studies on well-formed text, researchers have also addressed coherence modeling on text produced by language learners, which may contain many spelling and grammar errors.",
        "Utilizing LSA and Random Indexing methods, Higgins et al. (2004) measured the global",
        "coherence of students?",
        "essays by calculating the semantic relatedness between sentences and the corresponding prompts.",
        "In addition, Burstein et.",
        "al (2010) combined entity-grid features with writing quality features produced by an automated assessment system of essays to predict the coherence scores of student essays.",
        "Recently, Yannakoudakis and Briscoe (2012) systematically analyzed a variety of coherence modeling methods within the framework of an automated assessment system for non-native free text responses and indicated that features based on Incremental Semantic Analysis (ISA), local histograms of words, the part-of-speech IBM model, and word length were the most effective.",
        "In contrast to these previous studies involving well-formed text or learner text containing errors, this paper focuses on modeling coherence in spontaneous spoken responses as well as investigating discourse features in an attempt to extend the construct coverage of an automated speech scoring system.",
        "In a related study, Hassanali et al. (2012) investigated coherence modeling for spoken language in the context of a story retelling task for the automated diagnosis of children with language impairment.",
        "They annotated transcriptions of children's narratives with coherence scores as well as markers of narrative structure and narrative quality; furthermore they built models to predict the coherence scores based on Coh-Metrix features and the manually annotated narrative features.",
        "The current study differs from this one in that it deals with free spontaneous spoken responses provided by students at a university level; these responses therefore contain more varied and more complicated information than the child narratives.",
        "The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: First, we obtained coherence annotations on a corpus of spontaneous spoken responses drawn from a university-level English language proficiency assessment, and demonstrated an improvement of around 10% relative in the accuracy of the automated prediction of human holistic scores with the addition of the coherence annotations.",
        "Second, we applied the entity-grid features and writing quality features from an automated essay scoring system to predict the coherence scores; the experimental results have shown promising correlations between some of these features and the coherence scores."

        "In order to ensure a sufficient quantity of responses from each proficiency level for training and evaluating the coherence prediction features, the spoken responses selected for this study were balanced based on the human scores as follows: 25 responses were selected randomly from each of the 4 score points (1 - 4) for each of the 6 test questions.",

        "The three score points were defined as follows: 3 = highly coherent (contains no instances of confusing arguments or examples), 2 = somewhat coherent (contains some awkward points in which the speaker's line of argument is unclear), 1 = barely",

        "For responses receiving a coherence score of 2, the annotators were required to highlight the specific awkward points in the response.",
        "In addition, the annotators were specifically required to ignore disfluencies and grammatical errors as much as possible; thus, they were instructed to not label sentences or clauses as awkward points solely because of the presence of disfluent or ungrammatical speech.",
        "Two annotators (not drawn from the pool of expert human raters who provided the holistic scores) made independent coherence annotations for all 600 spoken responses.",

        "By utilizing a decision tree classifier (the J48 implementation from Weka (Hall et al., 2009)), 4-fold cross validation was conducted on the 600 responses to train and evaluate a scoring model for predicting the holistic proficiency scores.",
        "The resulting correlation between the predicted scores (based on the 96 baseline SpeechRater features) and the human holistic proficiency scores was r = 0.667.",
        "In order to model a spoken response's coherence, three different features were extracted from the human annotations.",

        "Secondly, following the work in Burstein et al. (2010), we collapsed the average coherence scores into a 2-point scale to deal with the difficulty in distinguishing somewhat and highly coherent responses.",

        "As shown in Table 2, when these three coherence features were combined separately with the SpeechRater features, the correlations could be improved from r = 0.667 to r > 0.7.",

        "However, the use of both kinds of annotations does not provide further improvement.",
        "When collapsing the average scores into a 2-point scale, there was a 0.009 correlation drop (not statistically significant), but the accuracy was slightly improved.",
