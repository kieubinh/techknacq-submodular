        "The IBM and HMM word alignment models (Brown et al., 1993; Vogel et al., 1996) have underpinned the majority of statistical machine translation systems for almost twenty years.",
        "The key attraction of these models is their principled probabilistic formulation, and the existence of (mostly) tractable algorithms for their training.",
        "The dominant Giza++ implementation of the IBM models (Och and Ney, 2003) employs a variety of exact and approximate EM algorithms to optimise categorical alignment distributions.",
        "While effective, this parametric approach results in a significant number of parameters to be tuned and intractable summations over the space of alignments for models 3 and 4.",
        "Giza++ hides the hyper-parameters with defaults and approximates the intractable expectations using restricted alignment neighbourhoods.",
        "However this approach was shown to often return alignments with probabilities well below the true maxima (Ravi and Knight, 2010).",
        "To overcome perceived limitations with the word based and non-syntactic nature of the IBM models many alternative approaches to word alignment have been proposed (e.g. (DeNero et al., 2008; Cohn and Blunsom, 2009; Levenberg et al., 2012)).",
        "While interesting results have been reported, these alternatives have failed to dislodge the IBM approach.",
        "In this paper we proposed to retain the original generative stories of the IBM models, while replacing the inflexible categorical distributions with hierarchical Pitman-Yor (PY) processes ?",
        "a mathematical tool which has been successfully applied to a range of language tasks (Teh, 2006b; Goldwater et al., 2006; Blunsom and Cohn, 2011).",
        "In the context of language modelling, the hierarchical PY process was shown to roughly correspond to interpolated Kneser-Ney (Kneser and Ney, 1995; Teh, 2006a).",
        "The key contribution of the hierarchical PY formulation is that it provides a principle probabilistic framework that easily extends to latent variable models, such as those used",
        "for alignment, for which a Kneser-Ney formulation is unclear.",
        "While Bayesian priors have previously been applied to IBM model 1 (Riley and Gildea, 2012), in this work we go considerably further by implementing non-parametric priors for the full Giza++ training pipeline.",
        "Inference for the proposed models and their hyper-parameters is done with Gibbs sampling.",
        "This eliminates the intractable summations over alignments and the need for tuning hyper-parameters.",
        "Further, we exploit the highly extendible nature of the hierarchical PY process to implement improvements to the original models such as the introduction of phrasal dependencies.",
        "We present extensive experimental results showing improvements in both BLEU scores and AER when compared to Giza++.",
        "The demonstrated improvements over IBM model 4 suggest that the heuristics used in the implementation of the EM algorithm for this model were suboptimal.",
        "We begin with a formal presentation of the hierarchical PY process used in our Bayesian approach to replace the original categorical distributions.",
        "Section 3 introduces our Bayesian formulation of the word alignment models, while its inference scheme is presented in the following section.",

        "Before giving the formal definition for the hierarchical Pitman-Yor (PY) process, we first give some intuition into how this distribution works and why it is commonly used to model problems in natural language.",
        "The hierarchical PY process is an atomic distribution that can share its atoms between different levels in a hierarchy.",
        "When used for language modelling it captures the probability of observing a word after any given sequence of n words.",
        "It does so by interpolating the observed frequency of the whole sequence followed by the word of interest, with the observed frequency of a shorter sequence followed by the word of interest.",
        "This interpolation is done in such a way that tokens in a more specific distribution are interpolated with types in a less specific one.",
        "If there is sufficient evidence for the whole word sequence, i.e. it is not sparse in the corpus, higher weight will be given to the frequency of the word of interest after the more specific sequence than the shorter one.",
        "If the sequence was not observed frequently and there is not enough information to model whether the word of interest follows after it frequently or not, the process will back-off to the shorter sequence and assign higher weight to its frequency instead.",
        "This is done in a recursive fashion, decreasing the sequence length by one every time until the probability is interpolated with the uniform distribution, much like interpolated Kneser-Ney, the state of the art for language modelling.",
        "Unlike Kneser-Ney, the hierarchical PY approach naturally extends to model complicated conditional distributions involving latent variables.",
        "Moreover, almost all instances of priors with categorical distributions can be replaced by the PY process, where in its most basic representation (with no conditional) it provides a flexible model of power law frequencies.",
        "The PY process generalises a number of simpler distributions.",
        "The Dirichlet distribution is a distribution over discrete probability mass functions of a certain given length which is often used to model prior beliefs on parameter sparsity in machine learning problems.",
        "The Dirichlet process generalises the Dirichlet distribution to a distribution over infinite sequences of non-negative reals that sum to one and is often used for nonparametric Bayesian inference.",
        "The PY process is used in the context of natural language processing as it further generalises the Dirichlet process by adding an additional degree of freedom that enables it to produce power-law discrete probability mass functions that resemble those seen experimentally in corpora (Goldwater et al., 2006).",

        "Using our hierarchical model one could easily introduce such dependencies on the context words of the word to be translated and their part-of-speech information.",
        "This could assist in both translation and reordering disambiguation, and would incorporate back-off by using smaller and smaller contexts when such information is sparse.",
        "Further improvements to models 3 and 4 could be carried out by introducing longer dependencies in the fertility and distortion distributions.",
        "Instead of conditioning on the previous word, one could use further information such as PoS tags, previously translated words, or previous fertilities.",
