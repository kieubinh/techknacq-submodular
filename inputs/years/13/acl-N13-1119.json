        "While the former is concerned with the meaning of a text, the latter can be seen as a collection of devices for creating it.",
        "Cohesion and coherence build the basis for most of the current natural language processing problems that deal with text understanding.",
        "Lexical cohesion ties together words or phrases that are semantically related.",
        "Once all the cohesive ties are identified the involved items can be grouped together to form so-called lexical chains, which form a theoretically well-founded building block in various natural language processing applications, such as word sense disambiguation (Okumura and Honda, 1994), summarization (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997), malapropism detection and correction (Hirst and St-Onge, 1998), document hyperlinking (Green, 1996), text segmentation (Stokes et al., 2004), topic tracking (Carthy, 2004), and others.",

        "A major drawback of this strategy is the dependency on the coverage of the resource, which has a direct impact on the lexical chains.",
        "Their quality can be expected to be poor for resource-scarce languages or specialized application domains.",
        "Statistical methods to modeling language semantics have proven to deliver good results in many natural language processing applications.",
        "In particular, probabilistic topic models have been successfully used for tasks such as summarization (Gong and Liu, 2001; Hennig, 2009), text segmentation (Misra et al., 2009), lexical substitution (Dinu and Lapata, 2010) or word sense disambiguation (Cai et al., 2007; Boyd-Graber et al., 2007).",
        "In this work, we address the question, whether statistical methods for the extraction of lexical chains can yield better results than existing knowledge-based methods, especially for underre-sourced languages or domains, following principles of Structure Discovery (Biemann, 2012).",
        "To address this, we have developed a methodology for evaluating the quality of lexical chains intrinsically, have carried out an annotation study, and report results on a corpus of manually annotated German news documents.",
        "After defining a measure for the comparison of (manually or automatically created) lexical chains in Section 2, Section 3 describes our annotation methodology and discusses issues regarding the inherent subjectivity of lexical chain annotation.",
        "In Section 4, three statistical approaches for lexical chaining are developed on the basis of the LDA topic model.",
        "Experiments that demonstrate the advantage of these approaches over a knowledge-baseline are conducted and evaluated in Section 5, and Section 6 concludes and provides an outlook future directions."

        "While we found it important to directly evaluate our lexical chaining algorithms on manually annotated data, a natural next step in this line of research is to use our lexical chaining methods as preprocessing steps for applications such as summarization, text segmentation or word sense disambiguation.",
