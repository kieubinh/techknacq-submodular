        "Language identification is a well-studied problem (Hughes et al., 2006), but it is typically only studied in its canonical text-classification formulation, identifying a document's language given sample texts from a few different languages.",
        "But there are several other interesting and useful formulations of the problem that have received relatively little attention.",
        "Here, we focus on the problem of labeling the languages of individual words within a multilingual document.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first paper to specifically address this problem.",
        "Our own motivation for studying this problem stems from issues encountered while attempting to build language resources for minority languages.",
        "In trying to extend parts of Kevin Scannell's Cru?bada?n project (Scannell, 2007), which automatically builds minority language corpora from the Web, we found that the majority of webpages that contain text in a minority language also contain text in other languages.",
        "Since Scannell's method builds these corpora by bootstrapping from the pages that were retrieved, the corpus-building process can go disastrously wrong without accounting for this problem.",
        "And any resources, such as a lexicon, created from the corpus will also be incorrect.",
        "In this paper, we explore techniques for performing language identification at the word level in mixed language documents.",
        "Our results show that one can do better than independent word language classification, as there are clues in a word's context: words of one language are frequently surrounded by words in the same language, and many documents have patterns that may be marked by the presence of certain words or punctuation.",
        "The methods in this paper also outperform sentence-level language identification, which is too coarse to capture most of the shifts between language.",
        "To evaluate our methods, we collected and manually annotated a corpus of over 250,000 words of bilingual (though mostly non-parallel) text from the web.",
        "After running several different weakly-supervised learning methods, we found that a conditional random field model trained with generalized expectation criteria is the most accurate and performs quite consistently as the amount of training data is varied.",
        "In section 2, we review the related work.",
        "In section 3, we define the task and describe the data and its annotation.",
        "Because the task of language identification for individual words has not been explicitly studied in the literature, and because of its importance to the overall task, we examine the features and methods that work best for independent word language identification in section 4.",
        "We begin to ex",
        "amine the larger problem of labeling the language of words in context in section 5 by describing our methods.",

        "Language identification is one of the older NLP problems (Beesley, 1988), especially in regards to spoken language (House and Neuburg, 1977), and has received a fair share of attention through the years (Hughes et al., 2006).",
        "In its standard formulation, language identification assumes monolingual documents and attempts to classify each document according to its language from some closed set of known languages.",
        "Many approaches have been proposed, such as Markov models (Dunning, 1994), Monte Carlo methods (Poutsma, 2002), and more recently support vector machines with string kernels, but nearly all approaches use the n-gram features first suggested by (Cavnar and Trenkle, 1994).",
        "Performance of language identification is generally very high with large documents, usually in excess of 99% accuracy, but Xia et al. (2009) mention that current methods still can perform quite poorly when the class of potential languages is very large or the texts to be classified are very short.",
        "This paper attempts to address three of the ongoing issues specifically mentioned by Hughes et al.",
        "(2006) in their survey of textual language identification: supporting minority languages, sparse or impoverished training data, and multilingual documents.",
        "A number of methods have been proposed in recent years to apply to the problems of unsupervised and weakly-supervised learning.",
        "Excluding self-and co-training methods, these methods can be categorized into two broad classes: those which bootstrap from a small number of tokens (sometimes called prototypes) (Collins and Singer, 1999; Haghighi and Klein, 2006), and those which impose constraints on the underlying unsupervised learning problem (Chang et al., 2007; Bellare et al., 2009; Druck et al., 2008; Ganchev et al., 2010).",
        "Constraint-based weakly supervised learning has been applied to some sequence labeling problems, through such methods as contrastive estimation (Smith and Eisner, 2005), generalized expectation criteria (Mann and McCallum, 2008), alternating projections (Singh et al., 2010), and posterior regularization (Ganchev et al., 2010).",
        "Perhaps the work that is most similar to this work is the study of code-switching within NLP literature.",
        "Most of the work done has been on automatically identifying code-switch points (Joshi, 1982; Solorio and Liu, 2008).",
        "The problem of identifying language in the presence of code-switching has seen the most attention in the realm of speech processing (Chu et al., 2007; Lyu and Lyu, 2008), among many others.",
        "Though code-switching has been well-studied linguistically, it is only one possible reason to explain why a document contains multiple languages, and is actually one of the less common causes observed in our corpus.",
        "For that reason, we approach this problem more generally, assuming no specific generative process behind multilingual text."

      "heading": "3 Task Definition",
      "text": [
        "The task we describe in this paper is a sequence labeling problem, labeling a word in running text according to the language to which it belongs.",
        "In the interest of being able to produce reliable human annotations, we limit ourselves to texts with exactly two languages represented, though the techniques developed in this paper would certainly be applicable to documents with more than two languages.",
        "The two languages represented in the paper are known a priori by the labeler and the only training data available to the labeler is a small amount of sample text in each of the two languages represented.",
        "In most NLP sequence labeling problems, the researchers can safely assume that each sequence (but not each item in the sequence) is independent and identically distributed (iid) according to some underlying distribution common to all the documents.",
        "For example, it is safe to assume that a sentence drawn from WSJ section 23 can be labeled by a model trained on the other sections.",
        "With the task of this paper we cannot assume that sequences from different documents are iid, (e.g. One document may have 90% of its words in Basque, while another only has 20%), but we do make the simplifying as",
        "sumption that sequences within the same document are iid.",
        "Because of this difference, the labeler is presented each document separately and must label its words independently of any other document.",
        "And the training data for this task is not in the form of labeled sequences.",
        "Rather, the models in this task are given two monolingual example texts which are used only to learn a model for individual instances.",
        "Any sequential dependencies between words must be bootstrapped from the document.",
        "It is this aspect of the problem that makes it well-suited for weakly-supervised learning.",
        "It is worth considering whether this problem is best approached at the word level, or if perhaps sentence-or paragraph-level language identification would suffice for this task.",
        "In those cases, we could easily segment the text at the sentence or paragraph level and feed those segments to an existing language identifier.",
        "To answer this question we segmented our corpus into sentences by splitting at every period, exclamation point, or question mark (an overly agressive approximation of sentence segmentation).",
        "Even if every sentence was given the correct majority label under this sentence segmentation, the maximum possible word-level accuracy that a sentence-level classifier could achieve is 85.8%, and even though this number reflects quite optimistic conditions, it is still much lower than the methods of this paper are able to achieve."

        "Following that in decreasing order of correlation strength were the cosine similarity between English and the document's second language, the number of words in the monolingual example text (even though we sampled from it), and the average length of gold-standard monolingual sequences in the document.",
        "The learning curve for GE-trained CRF in Figure 2 is somewhat atypical as far as most machine learning methods are concerned: performance is typically non-decreasing as more training data is made available.",
        "We believe that the model is becoming over-constrained as more words are used to create the constraints.",
        "The GE method does not have a way to specify that some of the soft constraints (for the labels observed most frequently in the sample text) should be more important than other constraints (those observed less frequently).",
        "When we measure the KL-divergence between the label distributions predicted by the constraints and the true label distribution, we find that this divergence seems to reach its minimum value between 600 and 800 words, which is where the GE+CRF also seems to reach its maximum performance.",
        "The step with a na?",
        "?ve Bayes classifier estimating the marginal label distribution ended up being quite important overall.",
        "Without it, the accuracy dropped by more than a full percentage point absolute.",
        "But the problem of inaccurate constraint estimation is one that needs further consideration.",
        "Some possible ways to address it may be to prune the constraints according to their frequency or perhaps according to a metric like entropy, or to vary the GE-criteria coefficient in the objective function in order to penalize the model less for varying from the expected model."

        "This paper addresses three of the ongoing issues specifically mentioned by Hughes et al. (2006) in their survey of textual language identification.",
        "Our approach is able to support minority languages; in",
        "fact, almost all of the languages we tested on would be considered minority languages.",
        "We also address the issue of sparse or impoverished training data.",
        "Because we use weakly-supervised methods, we are able to successfully learn to recognize a language with as few as 10 words of training data5.",
        "The last and most obvious point we address is that of multilingual documents, which is the focus of the paper.",
        "We present a weakly-supervised system for identifying the languages of individual words in mixed-language documents.",
        "We found that across a broad range of training data sizes, a CRF model trained with GE criteria is an accurate sequence classifier and is preferable to other methods for several reasons.",
        "One major issue to be improved upon in future work is how named entities are handled.",
        "A straightforward way to approach this may be to create another label for named entities, which (for the purposes of evaluation) would be considered not to belong to any of the languages in the document.",
        "We could simply choose not to evaluate a system on the named entity tokens in a document.",
        "Alternatively, the problem of language-independent named entity recognition has received some attention in the past (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003), and it may be beneficial to incorporate such a system in a robust word-level language identification system.",
        "Going forward, an issue that needs to be addressed with this method is its dependence on knowing the set of possible languages a priori.",
        "Because we don't see an easy way to adapt this method to accurately label words in documents from a possible set of thousands of languages when the document itself may only contain two or three languages, we would propose the following future work.",
        "We propose a two-step approach to general word-level language identification.",
        "The first step would be to examine a multilingual document, and with high accuracy, list the languages that are present in the document.",
        "The second step would be identical to the approach described in this paper (but with the two-language restriction lifted), and would be responsible for labeling the languages of individual words, using the set of languages provided by the first step.",
        "5With only 10 words of each language as training data, the CRF approach correctly labels 88% of words"
