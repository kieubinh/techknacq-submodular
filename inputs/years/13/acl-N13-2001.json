        "Coreference resolution (CR) is the task of linking together multiple expressions of a given entity (Yang et al., 2003).",
        "The field has experienced a surge of interest with several shared tasks in recent years: SemEval 2010 (Recasens et al., 2010), CoNLL 2011 (Pradhan et al., 2011) and CoNLL 2012 (Pradhan et al., 2012).",
        "However the field has from the very start been riddled with problems related to the scoring and comparison of CR systems.",
        "Currently there are five metrics in wider use: MUC (Vilain et al., 1995), B3 (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998), the two CEAF metrics (Luo, 2005) and BLANC (Re-casens and Hovy, 2011).",
        "As there is no global agreement on which metrics are the most appropriate, the above-mentioned shared tasks have used a combination of several metrics to evaluate the contenders.",
        "Although coreference resolution is a subproblem of natural language understanding, coreference resolution evaluation metrics have predominately been discussed in terms of abstract entities and hypothetical system errors.",
        "In our view, it is of utmost importance to observe actual texts and actual system errors."

        "This evaluation should then be extended from evaluating coreference resolution of single key/response entity pairs, to assessing the quality of coreference resolution on a text as a whole.",
        "And, finally: Every mention carries an information value, and this weight varies from quite heavy (as in vice-chief committee member Jiyun Tian), to somewhat lighter (Jiyun Tian) to virtually weightless (He).",
        "Information weights are not distributed randomly, but conform to discourse structure.",
        "It would be interesting to map the pattern of their distribution, and see if incorporating this information could improve both coreference resolution and its quantitative evaluation."
