        "Uncovering the structure of conversations often requires close reading by a human expert to be effective.",
        "Political debates are an interesting example: political scientists carefully analyze what gets said in debates to explore how candidates shape the debate's agenda and frame issues or how answers subtly (or not so subtly) shift the conversation by dodging the question that was asked (Rogers and Norton, 2011).",
        "Computational methods can contribute to the analysis of topical dynamics, for example through topic segmentation, dividing a conversation into smaller, topically coherent segments (Purver, 2011); or through identifying and summarizing the topics under discussion (Blei et al., 2003; Blei, 2012).",
        "However, the topics uncovered by such methods can be difficult for people to interpret (Chang et al., 2009), and previous visualization frameworks for topic models?e.g., ParallelTopics (Dou et al., 2011), Top-icViz (Eisenstein et al., 2012), the Topical Guide,1 or topic model visualization (Chaney and Blei, 2012)?",
        "are not particularly well suited for linearly structured conversations.",
        "This paper describes Argviz, an integrated, interactive system for analyzing the topical dynamics of",
        "multi-party conversations.",
        "We bring together previous work on Interactive Topic Modeling (ITM) (Hu et al., 2011), which allows users to efficiently inject their needs, expertise, and insights into model building via iterative topic refinement, with Speaker Identity for Topic Segmentation (SITS) (Nguyen et al., 2012), a state-of-the-art model for topic segmentation and discovery of topic shifts in conversations.",
        "Argviz's interface allows users to quickly grasp the topical flow of the conversation, discern when the topic changes and by whom, and interactively visualize the conversation's details on demand."

      "text": [
        "Our overall system consists of three steps: (1) data preprocessing, (2) interactive topic modeling, and (3) conversational topic segmentation and visualization.",
        "Data preprocessing Preprocessing creates bags of words that can be used by models.",
        "First, stopwords and low frequency terms are removed from tokenized text.",
        "This is then used as the data for topic modeling.",
        "Interactive topic modeling The topic modeling process then discovers?through posterior inference?the topics that best explain the conversational turns.",
        "Each of the topics is a multinomial distribution over words, which can be displayed to users along with the association of turns (documents) to these topics.",
        "The result of topic modeling may be imperfect; we give users an opportunity to refine and curate the topics using Interactive Topic Modeling (ITM) (Hu et al., 2011).",
        "The feedback from users is encoded in the form of correlations: word types that should co-occur in a topic or which should not.",
        "As these correlations are incorporated into the model, the topics learned by the model change and are presented",
        "again to the user.",
        "The process repeats over multiple iterations until the user is satisfied.",
        "In addition, a simple but important part of the interactive user experience is the ability for users to label topics, i.e., to identify a ?congress?",
        "topic that includes ?bill?, ?vote?, ?representative?, etc.",
        "ITM is a web-based application with a HTML and jQuery2 front end, connected via Ajax and JSON.",
        "Topic segmentation After the user has built interpretable topics, we use SITS?a hierarchical topic model (Nguyen et al., 2012)?to jointly discover the set of topics discussed in a given set of conversations and how these topics change during each conversation.",
        "We use the output of ITM to initialize SITS3 with a high quality user-specific set of topics.",
        "The outputs of SITS consist of (1) a set of topics, (2) a distribution over topics for each turn, and (3) a probability associated with each turn indicating how likely the topic of that turn has been shifted.",
        "The outputs of SITS are displayed using Argviz (Figure 2).",
        "Argviz is a web-based application, built using Google Web Toolkit (GWT),4 which allows users to visualize and manipulate SITS's outputs entirely in their browser after a single server request."

        "Argviz supports three main coordinated views: transcript, overview and topic.",
        "Transcript occupies the prime real estate for a close reading.",
        "It has a transcript panel and a speaker panel.",
        "The transcript panel displays the original transcript.",

        "SITS's outputs include a topic distribution and a topic shift probability for each turn in the conversation.",
        "In Argviz, these are represented using a heatmap and topic shift column.",
        "In the heatmap, each turn-specific topic distribution is displayed by a heatmap row (Sopan et al., 2013).",
        "There is a cell for each topic, and the color intensity of each cell is proportional to the probability of the corresponding topic of a particular turn.",
        "Thus, users can see the topical flow of the conversation through the vertical change in cells?",
        "color intensities as the conversation progresses.",
        "In addition, the topic shift column shows the topic shift probability (inferred by SITS) using color-coded bar charts, helping users discern large topic changes in the conversation.",
