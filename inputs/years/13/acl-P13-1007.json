        "The sentence there is one faculty member in every graduate committee is ambiguous with respect to quantifier scoping, since there are at least two possible readings: If one has wide scope, there is a unique faculty member on every committee.",
        "If every has wide scope, there can be different faculty members on each committee.",
        "Over the past decade there has been some work on statistical quantifier scope disambiguation (QSD) (Higgins and Sadock, 2003; Galen and MacCartney, 2004; Manshadi and Allen, 2011a).",
        "However, the extent of the work has been quite limited for several reasons.",
        "First, in the past two decades, the main focus of the NLP community has been on shallow text processing.",
        "As a deep processing task, QSD is not essential for many NLP applications that do not require deep understanding.",
        "Second, there has been a lack of comprehensive scope-disambiguated corpora, resulting in the lack of work on extensive statistical QSD.",
        "Third, QSD has often been considered only in the context of explicit quantification such as each and every versus some and a/an.",
        "These co-occurrences do not happen very often in real-life data.",
        "For example, Higgins and Sadock (2003) find fewer than 1000 sentences with two or more explicit quantifiers in the Wall Street journal section of Penn Treebank.",
        "Furthermore, for more than 60% of those sentences, the order of the quantifiers does not matter, either as a result of the logical equivalence (as in two existentials), or because they do not have any scope interaction.",
        "Having said that, with deep language processing receiving more attention in recent years, QSD is becoming a real-life issue.1 At the same time, new scope-disambiguated corpora have become available (Manshadi et al., 2011b).",
        "In this paper, we aim at tackling the third issue mentioned above.",
        "We push statistical QSD beyond explicit quantification, and address an interesting, yet practically important, problem in QSD: plurality and quantification.",
        "In spite of an extensive literature in theoretical semantics (Hamm and Hinrichs, 2010; Landmann, 2000), this topic has not been well investigated in computational linguistics.",
        "To illustrate the phenomenon, consider (1): 1.",
        "Three words start with a capital letter.",
        "A deep understanding of this sentence, requires deciding whether each word in the set, referred to by Three words, starts with a potentially distinct capital letter (as in Apple, Orange, Banana) or there is a unique capital letter which each word starts with (as in Apple, Adam, Athens).",
        "By treating the NP Three words as a single atomic entity, earlier work on automatic QSD has overlooked this problem.",
        "In general, every plural NP potentially introduces an implicit universal, ranging 1For example, Liang et al. (2011) in their state-of-the-art statistical semantic parser within the domain of natural language queries to databases, explicitly devise quantifier scoping in the semantic model.",
        "over the collection of entities introduced by the plural.2 Scoping this implicit universal is just as important.",
        "While explicit universals may not occur very often in natural language, the usage of plurals is very common.",
        "Plurals form 18% of the NPs in our corpus and 20% of the nouns in Penn Treebank.",
        "Explicit universals, on the other hand, form less than 1% of the determiners in Penn Treebank.",
        "Quantifiers are also affected by negation.",
        "Previous work (e.g., Morante and Blanco, 2012) has investigated automatically detecting the scope and focus of negation.",
        "However, the scope of negation with respect to quantifiers is a different phenomenon.",
        "Consider the following sentence.",
        "2.",
        "The word does not start with a capital letter.",
        "Transforming this sentence into a meaning representation language, for almost any practical purposes, requires deciding whether the NP a capital letter lies in the scope of the negation or outside of it.",
        "The former describes the preferred reading where The word starts with a lowercase letter as in apple, orange, banana, but the latter gives the unlikely reading, according to which there exists a particular capital letter, say A, that The word starts with, as in apple, Orange, Banana.",
        "By not involving negation in quantifier scoping, a semantic parser may produce an unintended interpretation.",
        "Previous work on statistical QSD has been quite restricted.",
        "Higgins and Sadock (2003), which we refer to as HS03, developed the first statistical QSD system for English.",
        "Their system disambiguates the scope of exactly two explicitly quantified NPs in a sentence, ignoring indefinite a/an, definites and bare NPs.",
        "Manshadi and Allen (2011a), hence MA11, go beyond those limitations and scope an arbitrary number of NPs in a sentence with no restriction on the type of quantification.",
        "However, although their corpus annotates the scope of negations and the implicit universal of plurals, their QSD system does not handle those.",
        "As a step towards comprehensive automatic QSD, in this paper we present our work on automatic scoping of the implicit universal of plurals and negations.",
        "For data, we use a new revision of MA11's corpus, first introduced in Manshadi et al.",
        "(2011b).",
        "The new revision, called QuanText, carries a more detailed, fine-grained scope annotation (Manshadi et al., 2012).",

        "The importance of scoping this universal, however, may vary based on the type of quantification.",
        "our model defines a baseline for future efforts on (comprehensive) QSD over QuanText.",
        "In addition to addressing plurality and negation, this work improves upon MA11's in two directions.",
