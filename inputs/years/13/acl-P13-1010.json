        "Many NLP applications which process or generate texts rely on information about local coherence, i.e. information about which entities occur in which sentence and how the entities are distributed in the text.",
        "This led to the development of many theories and models accounting for local coherence.",
        "One popular model, the centering model (Grosz et al., 1995), uses a ranking of discourse entities realized in particular sentences and computes transitions between adjacent sentences to provide insight in the felicity of texts.",
        "Centering models local coherence rather generally and has been applied to the generation of referring expressions (Kibble and Power, 2004), to resolve pronouns (Brennan et al., 1987, inter alia), to score essays (Miltsakaki and Kukich, 2004), to arrange sentences in the correct order (Karamanis et al., 2009), and to many other tasks.",
        "Poesio et al.",
        "(2004) observe that it is not clear how to set parameters in the centering model so that optimal performance in different tasks and languages can be achieved.",
        "Barzilay and Lapata (2008) criticize research on centering to be too dependent on manually annotated input.",
        "This led them to propose a local coherence model relying on a more parsimonious representation, the entity grid model.",
        "The entity grid is a two dimensional array where the rows represent sentences and the columns discourse entities.",
        "From this grid Barzilay and Lapata (2008) derive probabilities of transitions between adjacent sentences which are used as features for machine learning algorithms.",
        "They evaluate this approach successfully on sentence ordering, summary coherence rating, and readability assessment.",
        "However, their approach has some disadvantages which they point out themselves: data sparsity, domain dependence and computational complexity, especially in terms of feature space issues while building their model (Barzilay and Lapata (2008, p.8, p.10, p.30), Elsner and Charniak (2011, p.126, p.127)).",
        "In order to overcome these problems we propose to represent entities in a graph and then model local coherence by applying centrality measures to the nodes in the graph (Section 3).",
        "We claim that a graph is a more powerful representation for local coherence than the entity grid (Barzilay and Lapata, 2008) which is restricted to transitions between adjacent sentences.",
        "The graph can easily span the entire text without leading to computational complexity and data sparsity problems.",
        "Similar to the application of graph-based methods in other areas of NLP (e.g. work on word sense disambiguation by Navigli and Lapata (2010); for an overview over graph-based methods in NLP see Mihalcea and Radev (2011)) we model local coherence by relying only on centrality measures applied to the nodes in the graph.",
        "We apply our graph-based model to the three tasks handled by Barzilay and Lapata (2008) to show that it provides the same flexibility over disparate tasks as the entity grid model: sentence ordering (Section 4.1), summary coherence ranking (Section 4.2), and readability assessment (Section 4.3).",

        "We also show that, though we do not need a computationally expensive learning phase, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.",
        "From this we conclude that a graph is an alternative to the entity grid model: it is computationally more tractable for modeling local coherence and does not suffer from data sparsity problems (Section 5)."

        "In order to compare our results with those reported by Barzilay and Lapata (2008), entities used for the graph-based representation are discourse entities that head NPs.",
        "Table 6 shows that, for this task, syntactic information plays a dominant role (PAcc).",
        "A statistically significant improvement is provided by including syntactic information.",
        "It gives more weight to subject entities that are more numerous in the Britannica Elementary documents which are composed by simpler and shorter sentences.",
        "Finally, when distance is accounted for together with syntactic information, the accuracy is significantly improved (p < 0.01) with regard to the results obtained with syntactic information only.",
        "Table 6 also shows that when the number of entities ?shared?",
        "by two sentences is accounted for (PW ), the results are lower.",
        "Indeed, Encyclopedia Britannica documents are composed by longer sentences, that contain a higher number of entities.",
        "This increases the local coherence value of difficult documents more than the value of ?easy to read?",
        "documents, that contain less entities.",
        "When our graph-based representation used the coreference resolution system, unlike the observation of Barzilay and Lapata (2008), the results of our model decrease significantly.",
        "The poor performance of our system in this case can be explained by the fact that the coreference resolution system regroups more entities in Encyclopedia Britannica documents than in Britannica Elementary ones.",
        "Therefore, the number of entities that are ?shared?",
        "by two sentences increases more importantly in the Encyclopedia Britannica corpus, while the distance between two occurrences of one entity decreases in a more significant manner.",
        "For these reasons, the coherence scores associated with ?difficult to read?",
        "documents tend to be higher when coreference resolution is performed on our data, which reduces the performance of our system.",
        "As before, syntactic information leads to the best results, but does not allow the accuracy to be higher than random anymore.",
        "Compared to the results provided by Barzilay and Lapata (2008) with the entity grid model alone, our representation outperforms their model significantly.",
        "We believe that this difference is caused by how syntactic information is introduced in the document representation and by the fact that our system can deal with entities that appear throughout the whole document while the entity grid model only looks at entities within a three sentences windows.",
        "Our model which captures exclusively local coherence is almost on par with the results reported for Schwarm & Ostendorf's (2005) system which relies on a wide range of lexical, syntactic and semantic features.",
        "Only when Barzilay and Lapata (2008) combine the entity grid with Schwarm & Ostendorf's features they reach performance considerably better than ours.",
        "In addition to the experiments proposed by Barzilay and Lapata (2008), we used a third readability category, the Britannica Student, that contains articles targeted for youths (from 11 to 14 years old).",
        "These documents, which are quite similar to the Encyclopedia Britannica ones, are composed by an average of 44.1 sentences.",
        "As we were only able to find 99 articles out of the 107 original ones in this category, sub corpora of the three categories were used for the comparison with the Britannica Student articles.",

        "Concerning the comparison between Britannica Student and Britannica Elementary articles, Table 7 shows that integrating distance information gives slightly different results and tends to decrease the values of accuracy and F-measure.",
        "This is explained by the fact that Britannica Elementary documents contain fewer entities than Britannica Student articles.",
        "As the length of the two kinds of articles is similar, distance between entities in Britannica Elementary documents is more important.",
        "As a result, accounting for distance information lowers the local coherence values for the more coherent document, which reduces the performance of our model.",
        "As previously, syntactic information improves the results and, for this comparison, the best result is obtained when syntactic information alone is accounted for.",
        "This leads to an accuracy which is almost equal to the one when comparing Encyclopedia Britannica and Britannica Elementary (0.707 against 0.766).",

        "In this paper, we proposed an unsupervised and computationally efficient graph-based local coherence model.",
        "Experiments show that our model is robust among tasks and domains, and reaches reasonable results for three tasks with the same parameter values and settings (i.e. accuracy values of 0.889, 0.70 and 0.766 for sentence ordering, summary coherence rating and readability assessment tasks respectively (PAcc, Dist)).",
        "Moreover, our model can be optimized and obtains results comparable with entity grid based methods when proper settings are used for each task.",
        "Our model has two main advantages over the entity grid model.",
        "First, as the graph used for document representation contains information about entity transitions, our model does not need a learning phase.",
        "Second, as it relies only on graph centrality, our model does not suffer from the computational complexity and data sparsity problems mentioned by Barzilay and Lapata (2008).",
        "Our current model leaves space for improvement.",
        "Future work should first investigate the integration of information about entities.",
        "Indeed, our model only uses entities as indications of sentence connection although it has been shown that distinguishing important from unimportant entities, according to their named-entity category, has a positive impact on local coherence computation (Elsner and Charniak, 2011).",
        "Moreover, future work should also examine the use of discourse relation information, as proposed in (Lin et al., 2011).",
        "This can be easily done by adding edges in the projection graphs when sentences contain entities related from a discourse point of view while Lin et al's approach suffers from complexity and data sparsity problems similar to the entity grid model.",
        "Finally, these promising results on local coherence modeling make us believe that our graph-based representation can be used without much modification for other tasks, e.g. extractive summarization or topic segmentation.",
        "This could be achieved with link analysis algorithms such as PageRank, that decide on the importance of a (sentence) node within a graph based on global information recursively drawn from the entire graph.",
