        "The inclusion of entity-level features has been a driving force behind the development of many coreference resolution systems (Luo et al., 2004; Rahman and Ng, 2009; Haghighi and Klein, 2010; Lee et al., 2011).",
        "There is no polynomial-time dynamic program for inference in a model with arbitrary entity-level features, so systems that use such features typically rely on making decisions in a pipelined manner and sticking with them, operating greedily in a left-to-right fashion (Rahman and Ng, 2009) or in a multi-pass, sieve-like manner (Raghunathan et al., 2010).",
        "However, such systems may be locked into bad coreference decisions and are difficult to directly optimize for standard evaluation metrics.",
        "In this work, we present a new structured model of entity-level information designed to allow efficient inference.",
        "We use a log-linear model that can be expressed as a factor graph.",
        "Pairwise features appear in the model as unary factors, adjacent to nodes representing a choice of antecedent (or none) for each mention.",
        "Additional nodes model entity-level properties on a per-mention basis, and structural agreement factors softly drive properties of coreferent mentions to agree with one another.",
        "This is a key feature of our model: mentions manage their partial membership in various coreference chains, so that information about entity-level properties is decentralized and propagated across individual mentions, and we never need to explicitly instantiate entities.",
        "Exact inference in this factor graph is intractable, but efficient approximate inference can be carried out with belief propagation.",
        "Our model is the first discriminatively-trained model that both makes joint decisions over an entire document and models specific entity-level properties, rather than simply enforcing transitivity of pairwise decisions (Finkel and Manning, 2008; Song et al., 2012).",
        "We evaluate our system on the dataset from the CoNLL 2011 shared task using three different types of properties: synthetic oracle properties, entity phi features (number, gender, animacy, and NER type), and properties derived from unsupervised clusters targeting semantic type information.",
        "In all cases, our transitive model of entity properties equals or outperforms our pairwise system and our reimplementation of a previous entity-level system (Rahman and Ng, 2009).",
        "Our final system is competitive with the winner of the CoNLL 2011 shared task (Lee et al., 2011)."

        "We focus in particular on the resolution of theyA and them.",
        "In order to correctly resolve theyA to people rather than Sotheby's and Christie?s, we must take advantage of the fact that theyA appears as the subject of the verb believe, which is much more likely to be attributed to people than to auction houses.",
        "Binding principles prevent them from attaching to theyB.",
        "But how do we prevent it from choosing as its antecedent the next closest agreeing pronoun, theyA?",
        "One way is to exploit the correct coreference decision we have already made, theyA referring to people, since people are not as likely to have a price as art items are.",
        "This observation argues for enforcing agreement of entity-level semantic properties during inference, specifically properties relating to permitted semantic roles.",
