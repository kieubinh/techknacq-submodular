        "Standard techniques for transcribing modern documents do not work well on historical ones.",
        "For example, even state-of-the-art OCR systems produce word error rates of over 50% on the documents shown in Figure 1.",
        "Unsurprisingly, such error rates are too high for many research projects (Arlitsch and Herbert, 2004; Shoemaker, 2005; Holley, 2010).",
        "We present a new, generative model specialized to transcribing printing-press era documents.",
        "Our model is inspired by the underlying printing processes and is designed to capture the primary sources of variation and noise.",
        "One key challenge is that the fonts used in historical documents are not standard (Shoemaker, 2005).",
        "For example, consider Figure 1a.",
        "The fonts are not irregular like handwriting '",
        "each occurrence of a given character type, e.g. a, will use the same underlying glyph.",
        "However, the exact glyphs are unknown.",
        "Some differences between fonts are minor, reflecting small variations in font design.",
        "Others are more severe, like the presence of the archaic long s character before 1804.",
        "To address the general problem of unknown fonts, our model (a) (b) (c) Figure 1: Portions of historical documents with (a) unknown font, (b) uneven baseline, and (c) over-inking.",
        "learns the font in an unsupervised fashion.",
        "Font shape and character segmentation are tightly coupled, and so they are modeled jointly.",
        "A second challenge with historical data is that the early typesetting process was noisy.",
        "Hand-carved blocks were somewhat uneven and often failed to sit evenly on the mechanical baseline.",
        "Figure 1b shows an example of the text's baseline moving up and down, with varying gaps between characters.",
        "To deal with these phenomena, our model incorporates random variables that specifically describe variations in vertical offset and horizontal spacing.",
        "A third challenge is that the actual inking was also noisy.",
        "For example, in Figure 1c some characters are thick from over-inking while others are obscured by ink bleeds.",
        "To be robust to such rendering irregularities, our model captures both inking levels and pixel-level noise.",
        "Because the model is generative, we can also treat areas that are obscured by larger ink blotches as unobserved, and let the model predict the obscured text based on visual and linguistic context.",
        "Our system, which we call Ocular, operates by fitting the model to each document in an unsupervised fashion.",
        "The system outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, giving a 47% relative error reduction over Google's open source Tesseract system, and giving a 31% relative error reduction over ABBYY's commercial FineReader system, which has been used in large-scale historical transcription projects (Holley, 2010).",

        "2 Related Work Relatively little prior work has built models specifically for transcribing historical documents.",
        "Some of the challenges involved have been addressed (Ho and Nagy, 2000; Huang et al., 2006; Kae and Learned-Miller, 2009), but not in a way targeted to documents from the printing press era.",
        "For ex-ample, some approaches have learned fonts in an unsupervised fashion but require pre-segmentation of the image into character or word regions (Ho and Nagy, 2000; Huang et al., 2006), which is not feasible for noisy historical documents.",
        "Kae and Learned-Miller (2009) jointly learn the font and image segmentation but do not outperform modern baselines.",
        "Work that has directly addressed historical documents has done so using a pipelined approach, and without fully integrating a strong language model (Vamvakas et al., 2008; Kluzner et al., 2009; Kae et al., 2010; Kluzner et al., 2011).",
        "The most comparable work is that of Kopec and Lomelin (1996) and Kopec et al. (2001).",
        "They integrated typesetting models with language mod-els, but did not model noise.",
        "In the NLP com-munity, generative models have been developed specifically for correcting outputs of OCR systems (Kolak et al., 2003), but these do not deal directly with images.",
        "A closely related area of work is automatic decipherment (Ravi and Knight, 2008; Snyder et al., 2010; Ravi and Knight, 2011; Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein, 2011).",
        "The fundamental problem is similar to our own: we are presented with a sequence of symbols, and we need to learn a correspondence between symbols and letters.",
        "Our approach is also similar in that we use a strong language model (in conjunction with the constraint that the correspondence be regular) to learn the correct mapping.",
        "However, the symbols are not noisy in decipherment problems and in our problem we face a grid of pixels for which the segmentation into symbols is unknown.",
        "In contrast, decipherment typically deals only with discrete symbols.",
        "3 Model Most historical documents have unknown fonts, noisy typesetting layouts, and inconsistent ink lev-els, usually simultaneously.",
        "For example, the portion of the document shown in Figure 2 has all three of these problems.",
        "Our model must handle them jointly.",
        "We take a generative modeling approach inspired by the overall structure of the historical printing process.",
        "Our model generates images of documents line by line; we present the generative process for the image of a single line.",
        "Our primary random variables are E (the text) andX (the pixels in an image of the line).",
        "Additionally, we have a random variable T that specifies the layout of the bounding boxes of the glyphs in the image, and a random variable R that specifies aspects of the inking and rendering process.",

        "3.1 Language Model P (E) Our language model, P (E), is a Kneser-Ney smoothed character n-gram model (Kneser and Ney, 1995).",
        "We generate printed lines of text (rather than sentences) independently, without generating an explicit stop character.",
        "This means that, formally, the model must separately generate the character length of each line.",

        "3.2 Typesetting Model P (T |E) Generally speaking, the process of typesetting produces a line of text by first tiling bounding boxes of various widths and then filling in the boxes with glyphs.",
        "Our generative model, which is depicted in Figure 3, reflects this process.",
        "As a first step, our model generates the dimensions of character bounding boxes; for each character token index i we generate three bounding box widths: a glyph box width gi, a left padding box width li, and a right padding box width ri, as shown in Figure 3.",
        "We let the pixel height of all lines be fixed to h. Let Ti = (li, gi, ri) so that Ti specifies the dimensions of the character box for token index i; T is then the concatenation of all Ti, denoting the full layout.",

        "'c will come into play when we begin generating pixels in Section 3.3.",
        "3.2.1 Inking Model P (R) Before we start filling the character boxes with pixels, we need to specify some properties of the inking and rendering process, including the amount of ink used and vertical variation along the text baseline.",
        "Our model does this by gener-ating, for each character token index i, a discrete value di that specifies the overall inking level in the character's bounding box, and a discrete value vi that specifies the glyph's vertical offset.",
        "These variations in the inking and typesetting process are mostly independent of character type.",
        "Thus, in 209 our model, their distributions are not character-specific.",
        "There is one global set of multinomial parameters governing inking level ('INK), and another governing offset ('VERT); both are depicted on the left-hand side of Figure 3.",

        "3.3 Noise Model P (X|E, T,R) Now that we have generated a typesetting layout T and an inking context R, we have to actually generate each of the pixels in each of the character boxes, left padding boxes, and right padding boxes; the matrices that these groups of pixels comprise are denoted XGLYPHi , XLPADi , and XRPADi , respectively, and are depicted at the bottom of Figure 3.",

        "During the M-step, we update the parameters 'LPADc , 'RPADc using the standard closed-form multinomial updates and use a specialized closed-form update for 'GLYPHc that enforces unimodal-ity of the glyph width distribution.",
        "The glyph weights, 'c, do not have a closed-form update.",
        "The noise model that 'c parameterizes is a local log-linear model, so we follow the approach of Berg-Kirkpatrick et al. (2010) and use L-BFGS (Liu and Nocedal, 1989) to optimize the expected likelihood with respect to 'c.",
        "4.2 Coarse-to-Fine Learning and Inference The number of states in the dynamic programming lattice grows exponentially with the order of the language model (Jelinek, 1998; Koehn, 2004).",
        "As a result, inference can become slow when the language model order n is large.",
        "To remedy this, we take a coarse-to-fine approach to both learning and inference.",
        "On each iteration of EM, we perform two passes: a coarse pass using a low-order language model, and a fine pass using a high-order language model (Petrov et al., 2008; Zhang and Gildea, 2008).",
        "We use the marginals4 from the coarse pass to prune states from the dynamic program of the fine pass.",
        "In the early iterations of EM, our font parameters are still inaccurate, and to prune heavily based on such parameters would rule out correct analyses.",
        "Therefore, we gradually increase the aggressiveness of pruning over the course of EM.",
        "To ensure that each iteration takes approximately the same amount of computation, we also gradually increase the order of the fine pass, only reaching the full order n on the last iteration.",
        "To produce a decoding of the image into text, on the final iteration we run a Viterbi pass using the pruned fine model.",
        "3We compute the weighted mean and weighted variance of the glyph width expected counts.",
        "We set 'GLYPHc to be proportional to a discretized Gaussian with the computed mean and variance.",
        "This update is approximate in the sense that it does not necessarily find the unimodal multinomial that maximizes expected log-likelihood, but it works well in practice.",
        "4In practice, we use max-marginals for pruning to ensure that there is still a valid path in the pruned lattice.",

        "Specifically, for each word error we recorded whether or not the error contained punctuation (either in the predicted word or the gold word), whether the text in the corresponding portion of the original image was italicized, and whether the corresponding portion of the image exhibited over-inking, missing ink, or significant ink blotches.",
        "These last three feature types are subjective in nature but may still be informative.",
        "We found that 56% of errors were accompanied by over-inking, 50% of errors were accompanied by ink blotches, 42% of errors contained punctuation, 21% of errors showed missing ink, and 12% of errors contained text that was italicized in the original image.",
