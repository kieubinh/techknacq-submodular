        "Grounded language acquisition involves learning to comprehend and/or generate language by simply observing its use in a naturally occurring context in which the meaning of a sentence is grounded in perception and/or action (Roy, 2002; Yu and Ballard, 2004; Gold and Scassel-lati, 2007; Chen et al., 2010).",

        "Subsequently, Kim and Mooney (2012) extended their approach to make it tractable for the more complex problem of learning to follow natural-language navigation instructions from observations of humans following such instructions in a virtual environment (Chen and Mooney, 2011).",
        "The observed sequence of actions provides very weak, ambiguous supervision for learning instructional language since there are many possible ways to describe the same execution path.",
        "Although their approach improved accuracy on the navigation task compared to the original work of Chen and Mooney (2011), it was still far from human performance.",
        "Since their system employs a generative model, discriminative reranking (Collins, 2000) could potentially improve its performance.",
        "By training a discriminative classifier that uses global features of complete parses to identify correct interpretations, a reranker can significantly improve the accuracy of a generative model.",
        "Reranking has been successfully employed to improve syntactic parsing (Collins, 2002b), semantic parsing (Lu et al., 2008; Ge and Mooney, 2006), semantic role la-beling (Toutanova et al., 2005), and named entity recognition (Collins, 2002c).",
        "Standard reranking requires gold-standard interpretations (e.g. parse trees) to train the discriminative classifier.",
        "However, grounded language learning does not provide gold-standard interpretations for the training examples.",
        "Only the ambiguous perceptual context of the utterance is provided as supervision.",
        "For the navigation task, this supervision consists of the observed sequence of actions taken by a human when following an instruction.",
        "Therefore, it is impossible to directly apply conventional discriminative reranking to such problems.",
        "We show how to adapt reranking to work with such weak supervision.",
        "Instead of using gold-standard annotations to determine the correct interpretations, we simply prefer interpretations of navigation instructions that, when executed in the world, actually reach the intended destination.",
        "Additionally, we extensively revise the features typically used in parse reranking to work with the PCFG approach to grounded language learning.",

        "Since the gold-standard annotation gives the correct MR rather than a parse tree for each sentence, Gold selects as a single reference parse the candidate in the top 50 whose resulting MR is most similar to the gold-standard MR as determined by its parse accuracy.",
        "Ge and Mooney (2006) employ a similar approach when reranking semantic parses.",
        "The results show that our response-based approach (Single) has better execution accuracy than both the baseline and the standard approach using gold-standard parses (Gold).",
        "However, Gold does perform best on parse accuracy since it explicitly focuses on maximizing the accuracy of the resulting MR.",
        "In contrast, by focusing discriminative training on optimizing performance of the ultimate end task, our response-based approach actually outperforms the traditional approach on the final task.",
        "In addition, it only utilizes feedback that is naturally available for the task, rather than requiring an expert to laboriously annotate each sentence with a gold-standard MR.",
        "Even though Gold captures more elements of the gold-standard MRs, it may miss some critical MR components that are crucial to the final navigation task.",

        "Using multiple parses (Multi) clearly performs better for all evaluation metrics, particularly execution.",
        "As explained in Section 3.2, the single-best pseudo-gold parse provides weak, ambiguous feedback since it only provides a rough estimate of the response feedback from the execution module.",
        "Using a variety of preferable parses to update weights provides a greater amount and variety of weak feedback and therefore leads to a more accurate model.3 Comparison of different feature groups Table 3 compares reranking results using the different feature groups described in Section 4.",
        "Compared to the baseline model (Kim and Mooney, 2012), each of the feature groups Base (base features), Pred (predicate-only and verification-removed features), and Desc (descended action features) helps improve the performance of plan execution for both single sentence and complete paragraph navigation instructions.",
        "Among them, Desc is the most effective group of features.",

        "This approach was shown to be very effective compared to the traditional method of using gold-standard parses.",
        "In addition, since this response-based supervision is weak and ambiguous, we have also presented a method for using multiple reference parses to perform perceptron weight updates and shown a clear further improvement in end-task performance with this approach."
