        "and (b) ?John showered?, they seldom distinguish between (a) and the markedly different (c) ?John took my book?.",
        "In fact, the annotations of (a) and (c) are identical under the most widely-used schemes for English, the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al.,",

        "One example is machine translation to target languages that do not express this structural distinction (e.g., both (a) and (b) would be translated to the same",
        "German sentence ?John duschte?).",
        "Question Answering applications can also benefit from distinguishing between (a) and (c), as this knowledge would help them recognize ?my book?",
        "as a much more plausible answer than ?a shower?",
        "to the question ?what did John take??.",
        "This paper presents a novel approach to grammatical representation that annotates semantic distinctions and aims to abstract away from specific syntactic constructions.",
        "We call our approach Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation (UCCA).",
        "The word ?cognitive?",
        "refers to the type of categories UCCA uses and its theoretical underpinnings, and ?conceptual?",
        "stands in contrast to ?syntactic?.",
        "The word ?universal?",
        "refers to UCCA's capability to accommodate a highly rich set of semantic distinctions, and its aim to ultimately provide all the necessary semantic information for learning grammar.",
        "In order to accommodate this rich set of distinctions, UCCA is built as a multi-layered structure, which allows for its open-ended extension.",
        "This paper focuses on the foundational layer of UCCA, a coarse-grained layer that represents some of the most important relations expressed through linguistic utterances, including argument structure of verbs, nouns and adjectives, and the interrelations between them (Section 2).",
        "UCCA is supported by extensive typological cross-linguistic evidence and accords with the leading Cognitive Linguistics theories.",
        "We build primarily on Basic Linguistic Theory (BLT) (Dixon, 2005; 2010a; 2010b; 2012), a typological approach to grammar successfully used for the de",
        "scription of a wide variety of languages.",

        "UCCA is exceptional in (1) being a semantic scheme that abstracts away from specific syntactic forms and is not defined relative to a specific domain or language, (2) providing a coarse-grained representation which allows for open-ended extension, and (3) using cognitively-motivated categories.",
        "An extensive comparison of UCCA to existing approaches to syntactic and semantic representation, focusing on the major resources available for English, is found in Section 5.",

        "Our results show a quick learning curve and no substantial difference in the performance of annotators with and without background in linguistics.",
        "This is an advantage of UCCA over its syntactic counterparts that usually need annotators with extensive background in linguistics (see Section 3).",
        "We note that UCCA's approach that advocates automatic learning of syntax from semantic supervision stands in contrast to the traditional view of generative grammar (Clark and Lappin, 2010)."

        "We note that UCCA's structures reflect a single interpretation of the text.",
        "Several discretely different interpretations (e.g., high vs. low PP attachments) may therefore yield several different UCCA annotations.",

        "Second, some of the most prominent annotation projects do not provide reliable inter-annotator agreement scores (Artstein and Poesio, 2008).",
        "A recent work that did report inter-annotator agreement in terms of bracketing F-score is an annotation project of the PTB's noun phrases with more elaborate syntactic structure (Vadas and Cur",
        "ran, 2011).",
        "They report an agreement of 88.3% in a scenario where their two annotators worked separately.",
        "Note that this task is much more limited in scope than UCCA (annotates noun phrases instead of complete passages in UCCA; uses 2 categories instead of 12 in UCCA).",
        "Nevertheless, the obtained inter-annotator agreement is comparable.",
        "Disagreement examples.",
        "Here we discuss two major types of disagreements that recurred in the training process.",
        "The first is the distinction between Elaborators and Centers.",
        "In most cases this distinction is straightforward, particularly where one subunit determines the semantic type of the parent unit, while its siblings add more information to it (e.g., ?truckE companyC?",
        "is a type of a company and not of a truck).",
        "Some structures do not nicely fall into this pattern.",
        "One such case is with apposition.",
        "In the example ?the Fox drama Glory days?, both ?the Fox drama?",
        "and ?Glory days?",
        "are reasonable candidates for being a Center, which results in disagreements.",
        "Another case is the distinction between Scenes and non-Scene relations.",
        "Consider the example ?",
        "[John's portrayal of the character] has been described as ...?.",
        "The sentence obviously contains two scenes, one in which John portrays a character and another where someone describes John's doings.",
        "Its internal structure is therefore ?John?sA portrayalP [of the character]A?.",
        "However, the syntactic structure of this unit leads annotators at times into analyzing the subject as a non-Scene relation whose C is ?portrayal?.",
        "Static relations tend to be more ambiguous between a Scene and a non-Scene interpretation.",
        "Consider ?Jane Smith (ne?e Ross)?.",
        "It is not at all clear whether ?ne?e Ross?",
        "should be annotated as a Scene or not.",
        "Even if we do assume it is a Scene, it is not clear whether the Scene it evokes is her Scene of birth, which is dynamic, or a static Scene which can be paraphrased as ?originally named Ross?.",
        "This leads to several conforming analyses, each expressing a somewhat different conceptualization of the Scene.",
        "This central notion will be more elaborately addressed in future work.",
        "We note that all of these disagreements can be easily resolved by introducing an additional layer focusing on the construction in question."

        "UCCA's relative insensitivity to syntactic forms has potential benefits for a wide variety of semantic tasks.",
        "This section briefly demonstrates these benefits through a number of examples.",
        "Recall the example ?John took a shower?",
        "(Section 1).",
        "UCCA annotates the sentence as a single Scene, with a single Participant and a processual main relation: ?JohnA [tookF [aE showerC]C ]P ?.",
        "The paraphrase ?John showered?",
        "is annotated similarly: ?JohnA showeredP ?.",
        "The structure is also preserved under translation to other languages, such as German (?JohnA duschteP ?, where ?duschte?",
        "is a verb), or Portuguese ?JohnA [tomouF banhoC]P ?",
        "(literally, John took shower).",
        "In all of these cases, UCCA annotates the example as a Scene with an A and a P, whose Center is a word expressing the notion of showering.",
        "Another example is the sentence ?John does not have any money?.",
        "The foundational layer of UCCA annotates negation units as Ds, which yields the annotation ?JohnA [doesF ]S- notD [haveC]-S [anyE moneyC]A?",
        "(where ?does ... have?",
        "is a discontiguous unit)9.",
        "This sentence can be paraphrased as ?JohnA hasP noD moneyA?.",
        "UCCA reflects the similarity of these two sentences, as it annotates both cases as a single Scene which has two Participants and a negation.",
        "A syntactic scheme would normally annotate ?no?",
        "in the second sentence as a modifier of ?money?, and ?not?",
        "as a negation of ?have?.",
        "The value of UCCA's annotation can again be seen in translation to languages that have only one of these forms.",
        "For instance, the German translation of this sentence, ?JohnA hatS keinD GeldA?, is a literal translation of ?John has no money?.",
        "The Hebrew translation of this sentence is ?eyn le john kesef?",
        "(literally, ?there-is-no to John money?).",
        "The main relation here is therefore ?eyn?",
        "(there-is-no) which will be annotated as S. This yields the annotation ?eynS [leR JohnC]A kesefA?.",
        "The UCCA annotation in all of these cases is composed of two Participants and a State.",
        "In English and German, the negative polarity unit is represented as a D. The negative polarity of the Hebrew ?eyn?",
        "is represented in a more detailed layer.",
        "As a third example, consider the two sentences ?There are children playing in the park?",
        "and ?Children are playing in the park?.",
        "The two sentences have a similar meaning but substantially different syntactic structures.",
        "The first contains two clauses, an existential main clause (headed by ?there are?)",
        "and a subordinate clause (?playing in the park?).",
        "The second contains a simple clause headed by ?playing?.",

        "Aside from machine translation, a great variety of semantic tasks can benefit from a scheme that is relatively insensitive to syntactic variation.",

        "In this section we compare UCCA to some of the major approaches to grammatical representation in NLP.",
        "We focus on English, which is the most studied language and the focus of this paper.",
        "Syntactic annotation schemes come in many forms, from lexical categories such as POS tags to intricate hierarchical structures.",
        "Some formalisms focus particularly on syntactic distinctions, while others model the syntax-semantics interface as well (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1981; Pollard and Sag, 1994; Joshi and Schabes, 1997; Steed-man, 2001; Sag, 2010, inter alia).",
        "UCCA diverges from these approaches in aiming to abstract away from specific syntactic forms and to only represent semantic distinctions.",
        "Put differently, UCCA advocates an approach that treats syntax as a hidden layer when learning the mapping between form and meaning, while existing syntactic approaches aim to model it manually and explicitly.",
        "UCCA does not build on any other annotation layers and therefore implicitly assumes that semantic annotation can be learned directly.",
        "Recent work suggests that indeed structured prediction methods have reached sufficient maturity to allow direct learning of semantic distinctions.",
        "Examples include Naradowsky et al. (2012) for semantic role labeling and Kwiatkowski et al. (2010) for semantic parsing to logical forms.",
        "While structured prediction for the task of predicting tree structures is already well established (e.g., (Suzuki et al., 10The two sentences are somewhat different in terms of their information structure (Van Valin Jr., 2005), which is represented in a more detailed UCCA layer.",
        "2009)), recent work has also successfully tackled the task of predicting semantic structures in the form of DAGs (Jones et al., 2012).",
        "The most prominent annotation scheme in NLP for English syntax is the Penn Treebank.",
        "Many syntactic schemes are built or derived from it.",
        "An increasingly popular alternative to the PTB are dependency structures, which are usually represented as trees whose nodes are the words of the sentence (Ivanova et al., 2012).",
        "Such representations are limited due to their inability to naturally represent constructions that have more than one head, or in which the identity of the head is not clear.",
        "They also face difficulties in representing units that participate in multiple relations.",
        "UCCA proposes a different formalism that addresses these problems by introducing a new node for every relation (cf. (Sangati and Mazza, 2009)).",
        "Several annotated corpora offer a joint syntactic and semantic representation.",
        "Examples include the Groningen Meaning bank (Basile et al., 2012), Treebank Semantics (Butler and Yoshi-moto, 2012) and the Lingo Redwoods treebank (Oepen et al., 2004).",
        "UCCA diverges from these projects in aiming to abstract away from syntactic variation, and is therefore less coupled with a specific syntactic theory.",
        "A different strand of work addresses the construction of an interlingual representation, often with a motivation of applying it to machine translation.",
        "Examples include the UNL project (Uchida and Zhu, 2001), the IAMTC project (Dorr et al., 2010) and the AMR project (Banarescu et al., 2012).",
        "These projects share with UCCA their emphasis on cross-linguistically valid annotations, but diverge from UCCA in three important respects.",
        "First, UCCA emphasizes the notion of a multilayer structure where the basic layers are maximally coarse-grained, in contrast to the above works that use far more elaborate representations.",
        "Second, from a theoretical point of view, UCCA differs from these works in aiming to represent conceptual semantics, building on works in Cognitive Linguistics (e.g., (Langacker, 2008)).",
        "Third, unlike interlingua that generally define abstract representations that may correspond to several different texts, UCCA incorporates the text into its structure, thereby facilitating learning.",
        "Semantic role labeling (SRL) schemes bear similarity to the foundational layer, due to their focus on argument structure.",
        "The leading SRL ap",
        "proaches are PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) and NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004) on the one hand, and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) on the other.",
        "At this point, all these schemes provide a more fine-grained set of categories than UCCA.",
        "PropBank and NomBank are built on top of the PTB annotation, and provide for each verb (PropBank) and noun (NomBank), a delineation of their arguments and their categorization into semantic roles.",
        "Their structures therefore follow the syntax of English quite closely.",
        "UCCA is generally less tailored to the syntax of English (e.g., see secondary verbs (Dixon, 2005)).",
        "Furthermore, PropBank and NomBank do not annotate the internal structure of their arguments.",
        "Indeed, the construction of the commonly used semantic dependencies derived from these schemes (Surdeanu et al., 2008) required a set of syntactic head percolation rules to be used.",
        "These rules are somewhat arbitrary (Schwartz et al., 2011), do not support multiple heads, and often reflect syntactic rather than semantic considerations (e.g., ?millions?",
        "is the head of ?millions of dollars?, while ?dollars?",
        "is the head of ?five million dollars?).",
        "Another difference is that PropBank and NomBank each annotate only a subset of predicates, while UCCA is more inclusive.",
        "This difference is most apparent in cases where a single complex predicate contains both nominal and verbal components (e.g., ?limit access?, ?take a shower?).",
        "In addition, neither PropBank nor Nomabnk address copula clauses, despite their frequency.",
        "Finally, unlike PropBank and NomBank, UCCA's foundational layer annotates linkage relations.",
        "In order to quantify the similarity between UCCA and PropBank, we annotated 30 sentences from the PropBank corpus with their UCCA annotations and converted the outcome to PropBank-style annotations11.",
        "We obtained an unlabeled F-score of 89.4% when comparing to PropBank, which indicates that PropBank-style annotations are generally derivable from UCCA?s.",
        "The disagreement between the schemes reflects both annotation conventions and principle differences, some of which were discussed above.",
        "The FrameNet project (Baker et al., 1998) 11The experiment was conducted on the first 30 sentences of section 02.",
        "The identity of the predicates was determined according to the PropBank annotation.",
        "We applied a simple conversion procedure that uses half a dozen rules that are not conditioned on any lexical item.",
        "We used a strict evaluation that requires an exact match in the argument's boundaries.",
        "proposes a comprehensive approach to semantic roles.",
        "It defines a lexical database of Frames, each containing a set of possible frame elements and their semantic roles.",
        "It bears similarity to UCCA both in its use of Frames, which are a context-independent abstraction of UCCA's Scenes, and in its emphasis on semantic rather than distributional considerations.",
        "However, despite these similarities, FrameNet focuses on constructing a lexical resource covering specific cases of interest, and does not provide a fully annotated corpus of naturally occurring text.",
        "UCCA's foundational layer can be seen as a complementary effort to FrameNet, as it focuses on high-coverage, coarse-grained annotation, while FrameNet is more fine-grained at the expense of coverage."
