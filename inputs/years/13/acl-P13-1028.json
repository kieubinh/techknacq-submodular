        "The task of unsupervised dependency parsing (which strongly relates to the grammar induction task) has become popular in the last decade, and its quality has been greatly increasing during this period.",
        "The first implementation of Dependency Model with Valence (DMV) (Klein and Manning, 2004) with a simple inside-outside inference algorithm (Baker, 1979) achieved 36% attachment score on English and was the first system outperforming the adjacent-word baseline.1 Current attachment scores of state-of-the-art unsupervised parsers are higher than 50% for many languages (Spitkovsky et al., 2012; Blunsom and Cohn, 2010).",
        "This is still far below the supervised approaches, but their indisputable advantage is the fact that no annotated treebanks are needed and the induced structures are not bur",
        "which each word is attached to the previous (or the following) word.",
        "The attachment score of 35.9% on all the WSJ test sentences was taken from (Blunsom and Cohn, 2010).",
        "supervised parsers always only simulate the treebanks they were trained on, whereas unsupervised parsers have an ability to be fitted to different particular applications.",
        "Some of the current approaches are based on the DMV, a generative model where the grammar is expressed by two probability distributions: Pchoose(cd|ch, dir), which generates a new child cd attached to the head chin the direction dir (left or right), and Pstop(STOP |ch, dir , ?",
        "?",
        "?",
        "), which makes a decision whether to generate another child of chin the direction dir or not.2 Such a grammar is then inferred using sampling or variational methods.",
        "Unfortunately, there are still cases where the inferred grammar is very different from the grammar we would expect, e.g. verbs become leaves instead of governing the sentences.",
        "Rasooli and Faili (2012) and Bisk and Hockenmaier (2012) made some efforts to boost the verbocentricity of the inferred structures; however, both of the approaches require manual identification of the POS tags marking the verbs, which renders them useless when unsupervised POS tags are employed.",
        "The main contribution of this paper is a considerable improvement of unsupervised parsing quality by estimating the Pstop probabilities externally using a very large corpus, and employing this prior knowledge in the standard inference of DMV.",
        "The estimation is done using the reducibility principle introduced in (Marec?ek and Z?abokrtsky?, 2012).",
        "The reducibility principle postulates that if a word (or a sequence of words) can be removed from a sentence without violating its grammatical correctness, it is a leaf (or a subtree) in its dependency structure.",
        "For the purposes of this paper, we assume the following hypothesis: If a sequence of words can be removed from 2The Pstop probability may be conditioned by additional parameters, such as adjacency adj or fringe word cf , which will be described in Section 4.",
        "quences of words that can be reduced are underlined.",
        "a sentence without violating its grammatical correctness, no word outside the sequence depends on any word in the sequence.",
        "Our hypothesis is a generalization of the original hypothesis since it allows a reducible sequence to form several adjacent subtrees.",
        "Let's outline the connection between the Pstop probabilities and the property of reducibility.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of a dependency tree.",
        "Sequences of reducible words are marked by thick lines below the sentence.",
        "Consider for example the word ?further?.",
        "It can be removed and thus, according to our hypothesis, no other word depends on it.",
        "Therefore, we can deduce that the Pstop probability for such word is high both for the left and for the right direction.",
        "The phrase ?for further discussions?",
        "is reducible as well and we can deduce that the Pstop of its first word (?for?)",
        "in the left direction is high since it cannot have any left children.",
        "We do not know anything about its right children, because they can be located within the sequence (and there is really one in Figure 1).",
        "Similarly, the word ?discussions?, which is the last word in this sequence, cannot have any right children and we can estimate that its right Pstop probability is high.",
        "On the other hand, non-reducible words such, as the verb ?asked?",
        "in our example, can have children, and therefore their Pstop can be estimated as low for both directions.",
        "The most difficult task in this approach is to automatically recognize reducible sequences.",
        "This problem, together with the estimation of the stop-probabilities, is described in Section 3.",
        "Our model, not much different from the classic DMV, is introduced in Section 4.",
        "Section 5 describes the inference algorithm based on Gibbs sampling.",
