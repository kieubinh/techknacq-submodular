        "However, such a reduction could be achieved with a lesser effort through the means of syntagma based word clustering.",
        "In this paper, the problem of data sparsity in sentiment analysis, both monolingual and cross-lingual, is addressed through the means of clustering.",
        "Experiments show that cluster based data sparsity reduction leads to performance better than sense based classification for sentiment analysis at document level.",
        "Similar idea is applied to Cross Lingual Sentiment Analysis (CLSA), and it is shown that reduction in data sparsity (after translation or bilingual-mapping) produces accuracy higher than Machine Translation based CLSA and sense based CLSA."

        "Data sparsity is the bane of Natural Language Processing (NLP) (Xue et al., 2005; Minkov et al., 2007).",
        "Language units encountered in the test data but absent in the training data severely degrade the performance of an NLP task.",
        "NLP applications innovatively handle data sparsity through various means.",
        "A special, but very common kind of data sparsity viz., word sparsity, can be addressed in one of the two obvious ways: 1) sparsity reduction through paradigmatically related words or 2) sparsity reduction through syntagmatically related words.",
        "Paradigmatic analysis of text is the analysis of concepts embedded in the text (Cruse, 1986; Chandler, 2012).",
        "WordNet is a byproduct of such an analysis.",
        "In WordNet, paradigms are manually generated based on the principles of lexical and semantic relationship among words (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "WordNets are primarily used to address the problem of word sense disambiguation.",
        "However, at present there are many NLP applications which use WordNet.",
        "One such application is Sentiment Analysis (SA) (Pang and Lee, 2002).",
        "Recent research has shown that word sense based semantic features can improve the performance of SA systems (Rentoumi et al., 2009; Tamara et al., 2010; Balamurali et al., 2011) compared to word based features.",
        "Syntagmatic analysis of text concentrates on the surface properties of the text.",
        "Compared to paradigmatic property extraction, syntagmatic processing is relatively light weight.",
        "One of the obvious syntagmas is words, and words are grouped into equivalence classes or clusters, thus reducing the model parameters of a statistical NLP system (Brown et al., 1992).",
        "When used as an additional feature with word based language models, it has been shown to improve the system performance viz., machine translation (Uszkoreit and Brants, 2008; Stymne, 2012), speech recognition (Martin et al., 1995; Samuelsson and Reichl, 1999), dependency parsing (Koo et al., 2008; Haffari et al., 2011; Zhang and Nivre, 2011; Tratz and Hovy, 2011) and NER (Miller et al., 2004; Faruqui and Pado?, 2010; Turian et al., 2010; Ta?ckstro?m et al., 2012).",
        "In this paper, the focus is on alleviating the data sparsity faced by supervised approaches for SA through the means of cluster based features.",
        "As WordNets are essentially word",
        "clusters wherein words with the same meaning are clubbed together, they address the problem of data sparsity at word level.",
        "The abstraction and dimensionality reduction thus achieved attributes to the superior performance for SA systems that employs WordNet senses as features.",
        "However, WordNets are manually created.",
        "Automatic creation of the same is challenging and not much successful because of the linguistic complexity involved.",
        "In case of SA, manually creating the features based on WordNet senses is a tedious and an expensive process.",
        "Moreover, WordNets are not present for many languages.",
        "All these factors make the paradigmatic property based cluster features like WordNet senses a less promising pursuit for SA.",
        "The syntagmatic analysis essentially makes use of distributional similarity and may in many circumstances subsume the paradigmatic analysis.",
        "In the current work, this particular insight is used to solve the data sparsity problem in the sentiment analysis by leveraging unlabelled monolingual corpora.",
        "Specifically, experiments are performed to investigate whether features developed from manually crafted clusterings (coming from WordNet) can be replaced by those generated from clustering based on syntagmatic properties.",
        "Further, cluster based features are used to address the problem of scarcity of sentiment annotated data in a language.",
        "Popular approaches for Cross-Lingual Sentiment Analysis (CLSA) (Wan, 2009; Duh et al., 2011) depend on Machine Translation (MT) for converting the labeled data from one language to the other (Hiroshi et al., 2004; Banea et al., 2008; Wan, 2009).",
        "However, many languages which are truly resource scarce, do not have an MT system or existing MT systems are not ripe to be used for CLSA (Balamurali et al., 2013).",
        "To perform CLSA, this study leverages unlabelled parallel corpus to generate the word alignments.",
        "These word alignments are then used to link cluster based features to obliterate the language gap for performing SA.",
        "No MT systems or bilingual dictionaries are used for this study.",
        "Instead, language gap for performing CLSA is bridged using linked cluster or cross-lingual clusters (explained in section 4) with the help of unlabelled monolingual corpora.",
        "The contributions of this paper are two fold:",
        "1.",
        "Features created from manually built and",
        "finer clusters can be replaced by inexpensive cluster based features generated solely from unlabelled corpora.",
        "Experiments performed on four publicly available datasets in three languages viz., English, Hindi and Marathi1 suggest that cluster based features can considerably boost the performance of an SA system.",
        "Moreover, state of the art result is obtained for one of the publicly available dataset.",

        "However, a contrary result was obtained.z In Hindi, the subject and the object of the sentence are linked using a case marker.",
        "Upon error analysis, it was found that there was a lot of irregular compounding based on case markers.",
        "Case markers were compounded with the succeeding word.",
        "This is a deviation from the real scenario which would have resulted in incorrect clustering leading to an unexpected result.",
        "However, the same would not have occurred for a classifier developed on sense based features as it was manually sense tagged.",
        "Clustering induces a reduction in the data sparsity.",
        "For example, on En-PD, percentage of features present in the test set and not present in the training set to those present in the test set are 34.17%, 11.24%, 0.31% for words, synsets and cluster based features respectively.",
        "The improvement in the performance of classifiers may be attributed to this feature size reduction.",
        "However, it must be noted that clustering based on unlabelled corpora is less taxing than manually creating paradigmatic property based clusters like WordNet synsets.",
        "Barring one instance, both cluster based features outperform word based features.",
        "The reason for the drop in the accuracy of approach based on sense features for En-PD dataset is the domain specific nature of sentiment analysis (Blitzer et al., 2007), which is explained in the next point.",
        "2.",
        "Domain issues are resolved while using cluster based features: For En-PD, the classifier developed using sense features based on paradigmatic analysis performs inferior to word based features.",
        "Compared to other datasets used for analysis, this dataset was sense annotated using an automatic WSD engine.",
        "This engine was trained on a travel domain corpus and as WSD is also domain specific, the final classification performance suffered.",
        "Additionally, as the target domain was on products, the automatic WSD engine employed had an in-domain accuracy of 78%.",
        "The sense disambiguation accuracy of the same would have lowered in a cross-domain setting.",
        "This might have had a degrading effect on the SA accuracy.",
        "However, it was seen that classifier developed on cluster features based on syntagmatic analysis do not suffer from this.",
        "Such clusters obliterate domain relates issues.",
        "In addition, as more unlabelled data is included for clustering, the classification accuracy improves.8 Thus, clustering may be employed to tackle other specific domain related issues in SA.",
        "3.",
        "Cluster based features using syntagmatic analysis requires lesser training data: Cluster based features drastically reduces the dimension of the feature vector.",
        "For instance, the size of sense based features for En-TD dataset was 1/6th of the size of word based features.",
        "This reduces the perplexity of the classification model.",
        "The reduction in the perplexity leads to the reduction of training documents to attain the same classification accuracy without any dimensionality reduction.",
        "This is evident from Figure 1 where accuracy of the cluster features based on unlabelled corpora are higher even with lesser training data.",
        "4.",
        "Effect of cluster size: The cluster size (number of clusters employed) has an implication on the purity of each cluster with respect to the application.",
        "The system performance improved upon increasing the cluster size and converged after attaining a certain level of accuracy.",
        "In general, it was found that the best classification accuracy was obtained for a cluster size between 1000 and 2500.",
        "As evident from Table 2, once the optimal accuracy is obtained, no significant changes were observed by increasing the cluster size.",
        "5.",
        "Clustering based CLSA is effective: For target language as Hindi, CLSA accuracy based on cross-lingual clustering (syntagmatic) outperforms the one based on MT (refer to Table 3).",
        "This was true for the constraint clustering approach based on cross-lingual clustering.",
        "Whereas, sentiment classifier using sense (PS) or direct cluster linking (DCL) is not very effective.",
        "In case of PS approach, the coverage of the multidict was a problem.",
        "The number of a linkages between sense from English to Hindi is only around 1/3rd the size of Princeton WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "Similarly in case of DCL approach, monolingual likelihood is different from the cross-lingual likelihood in terms of the linkages.",
        "6.",
        "A note on CLSA for truly resource scarce languages: Note that there is no publicly available MT system for English to Marathi.",
        "Moreover, the digital content in Marathi language does not have a standard encoding format.",
        "This impedes the automatic crawling of the web for corpora creation for SA.",
        "Much manual effort has to be put to collect enough corpora for analysis.",
        "However, even in these languages, unlabelled corpora is easy to obtain.",
        "Marathi was chosen to depict a truly resource scarce SA scenario.",
        "Cluster features based classifier comparatively performed well with 60% classification accuracy.",
        "An MT based system would have suffered in this case as Marathi, as stated earlier, is a morphologically rich language and as compared to English, has a different word ordering.",
        "This could degrade the accuracy of the machine translation itself, limiting the performance of an MT based CLSA system.",
        "All this is obliterated by the use of a cluster based CLSA approach.",
        "Moreover, as more monolingual copora is added for clustering, the cross lingual cluster linkages could be refined.",
        "This can further boost the CLSA accuracy."

        "This paper explored feasibility of using word cluster based features in lieu of features based on WordNet senses for sentiment analysis to alleviate the problem of data sparsity.",
        "Abstractly, the motivation was to see if highly effective features based on paradigmatic property based clustering could be replaced with the inexpensive ones based on syntagmatic property for SA.",
        "The study was performed for both monolingual SA and cross-lingual SA.",
        "It was found that cluster features based on syntagmatic analysis are better than the WordNet sense features based on paradigmatic analysis for SA.",
        "Invesitgation revealed that a considerable decrease in the training data could be achieved while using such class based features.",
        "Moreover, as syntagma based word clusters are homogenous, it was able to address domain specific nature of SA as well.",
        "For CLSA, clusters linked together using unlabelled parallel corpora do away with the need of translating labelled corpora from one language to another using an intermediary MT system or bilingual dictionary.",
        "Such a method outperforms an MT based CLSA approach.",
        "Further, this approach was found to be useful in cases where there are no MT systems to perform CLSA and the language of analysis is truly resource scarce.",
        "Thus, wider implication of this study is that many widely spoken yet resource scare languages like Pashto, Sundanese, Hausa, Gujarati and Punjabi which do not have an MT system could now be analysed for sentiment.",
        "The approach presented here for CLSA will still require a parallel corpora.",
        "However, the size of the parallel corpora required",
        "for CLSA can considerably be much lesser than the size of the parallel corpora required to train an MT system.",
        "A naive cluster linkage algorithm based on word alignments was used to perform CLSA.",
        "As a result, there were many erroneous linkages which lowered the final SA accuracy.",
        "Better cluster-linking approaches could be explored to alleviate this problem.",
        "There are many applications which use WordNet like IR, IE etc.",
        "It would be interesting to see if these could be replaced by clusters based on the syntagmatic property."
