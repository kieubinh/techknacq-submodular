        "The work we present in this article focuses on the automatic building of a thesaurus from a corpus.",
        "As illustrated by Table 1, such thesaurus gives for each of its entries a list of words, called semantic neighbors, that are supposed to be semantically linked to the entry.",
        "Generally, each neigh-bor is associated with a weight that characterizes the strength of its link with the entry and all the neighbors of an entry are sorted according to the decreasing order of their weight.",
        "The term semantic neighbor is very generic and can have two main interpretations according to the kind of semantic relations it is based on: one relies only on paradigmatic relations, such as hypernymy or synonymy, while the other considers syntagmatic relations, called collocation relations by (Halliday and Hasan, 1976) in the context of lexical cohesion or ?non-classical relations?",
        "by (Morris and Hirst, 2004).",
        "The distinction between these two interpretations refers to the distinction between the notions of semantic similarity and semantic relatedness as it was done in (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006) or in (Zesch and Gurevych, 2010) for instance.",
        "However, the limit between these two notions is sometimes hard to find in existing work as terms semantic similarity and semantic relatedness are often used interchangeably.",
        "Moreover, semantic similarity is frequently considered as included into semantic relatedness and the two problems are often tackled by using the same methods.",
        "In the remainder of this article, we will use the term semantic similarity with its generic sense and the term semantic relatedness for referring more specifically to similarity based on syntagmatic relations.",
        "Following work such as (Grefenstette, 1994), a widespread way to build a thesaurus from a corpus is to use a semantic similarity measure for extracting the semantic neighbors of the entries of the thesaurus.",
        "Three main ways of implementing such measures can be distinguished.",
        "The first one relies on handcrafted resources in which semantic relations are clearly identified.",
        "Work based on WordNet-like lexical networks for building semantic similarity measures such as (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006) or (Pedersen et al., 2004) falls into this category.",
        "These measures typically exploit the hierarchical structure of these networks, based on hypernymy relations.",
        "The second approach makes use of a less structured source of knowledge about words such as the definitions of classical dictionaries or the glosses of WordNet.",
        "WordNet's glosses were used to support Lesk-like measures in (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003) and more recently, measures were also defined from Wikipedia or Wiktionaries (Gabrilovich and",
        "Markovitch, 2007).",
        "The last option is the corpus-based approach, based on the distributional hypothesis (Firth, 1957): each word is characterized by the set of contexts from a corpus in which it appears and the semantic similarity of two words is computed from the contexts they share.",
        "This perspective was first adopted by (Grefenstette, 1994) and (Lin, 1998) and then, explored in details in (Curran and Moens, 2002b), (Weeds, 2003) or (Heylen et al., 2008).",
        "The problem of improving the results of the ?classical?",
        "implementation of the distributional approach as it can be found in (Curran and Moens, 2002a) for instance was already tackled by some work.",
        "A part of these proposals focus on the weighting of the elements that are part of the contexts of words such as (Broda et al., 2009), in which the weights of context elements are turned into ranks, or (Zhitomirsky-Geffet and Da-gan, 2009), followed and extended by (Yamamoto and Asakura, 2010), that proposes a bootstrapping method for modifying the weights of context elements according to the semantic neighbors found by an initial distributional similarity measure.",
        "However, another part of these proposals implies more radical changes.",
        "The use of dimensionality reduction techniques, for instance Latent Semantic Analysis in (Pado?",
        "and Lapata, 2007), the multi-prototype (Reisinger and Mooney, 2010) or examplar-based models (Erk and Pado, 2010), the Deep Learning approach of (Huang et al., 2012) or the redefinition of the distributional approach in a Bayesian framework (Kazama et al., 2010) can be classified into this second category.",
        "The work we present in this article takes place in the framework defined by (Grefenstette, 1994) for implementing the distributional approach but proposes a new method for improving a thesaurus built in this context based on the identification of its bad semantic neighbors rather than on the adaptation of the weight of their features."

        "Our work shares with (Zhitomirsky-Geffet and Dagan, 2009) the use of a kind of bootstrapping as it starts from a distributional thesaurus and to some extent, exploits it for its improvement.",

        "semantic neighbors of an entry in the thesaurus for adapting the weights of distributional context elements, it focuses on the detection of its bad semantic neighbors, that is to say the neighbors of the entry that are actually not semantically similar to the entry.",
        "In Table 1, waterworks for the entry cabdriver and hollowness for the entry machination are two examples of such kind of neighbors.",
        "By discarding these bad neighbors or at least by downgrading them, the rank of true semantic neighbors is expected to be lower.",
        "This makes the thesaurus more interesting to use since the quality of such thesaurus strongly decreases as the rank of the neighbors of its entries increases (see Section 4.1 for an illustration), which means in practice that only the first neighbors of an entry can be generally exploited.",
        "The approach we propose for identifying the bad semantic neighbors of a thesaurus entry relies on the distributional hypothesis, as the method for the initial building of the thesaurus, but implements it in a different way.",
        "This hypothesis roughly specifies that from a semantic viewpoint, the meaning of a word can be characterized by the set of contexts in which this word occurs.",
        "As a consequence, two words are considered as semantically similar if they occur in a large enough set of shared contexts.",
        "In work such as (Curran and Moens, 2002a), this hypothesis is implemented by collecting for each entry the words it co-occurs with in a large corpus.",
        "This co-occurrence can be based either on the position of the word in the text in relation to the entry or on the presence of a syntactic relation between the entry and the word.",
        "As a result, the distributional representation of a word takes the unstructured form of a bag of words or the more structured form of a set of pairs {syntactic relation, word}.",
        "A variant of this approach was proposed in (Kazama et al., 2010) where the distributional representation of a word is modeled as a multinomial distribution with Dirichlet as prior.",
        "However, this approach globally faces a certain lack of diversity and complexity of the features of its models.",
        "For instance, features such as ngrams of words or ngrams of parts of speech are not considered whereas they are widely used in tasks such as word sense disambiguation (WSD) for instance, probably because they would lead to very large models and because similarity measures such as the Cosine measure are not necessarily suitable for heterogeneous representations (Alexandrescu and Kirchhoff, 2007).",

        "The underlying hypothesis follows the distributional principles: a word and a synonym should appear in the same contexts, which means that they are characterized by the same features.",

        "in context As mentioned in section 3.1, the starting point of our reranking process is the definition of a model for determining to what extent a word in a sentence, which is not supposed to be known in the context of this task, corresponds or not to a reference word E. This task can also be viewed as a tagging task in which the occurrences of a target word T are labeled with two tags: E and notE.",

        "A step further, such classifier can be viewed as a means for testing whether or not a word has the same meaning as E. This is a problem close to WSD as it is performed in the context of the pseudo-word disambiguation paradigm (Gale et al., 1992): a pseudo-word is created with two senses, E and notE, notE corresponding to one or several words that are supposed to be representative of a meaning different from the meaning of E. The objective is then to build a classifier for distinguishing the pseudo-senses E and notE.",

Each neighboring word is represented under its lemma form as a binary feature whose value is equal to 1 when it is present in the same sentence as E. For the second type of features, we take more precisely the POS of the three words before E and those of the three words after E. Each pair {POS, position} corresponds to a binary feature for the SVM classifier.",

        "In our case, i and j take their values in the interval [?3,+3], similarly to POS.",

        "In practice, taking neighbors with a rather small rank as negative examples is a better option because these examples are more useful in terms of discrimination as they are close to the transition zone between negative and positive examples.",

        "As a consequence, the improvement of such thesaurus is generally not directly addressed but is a possible consequence of the improvement of semantic similarity measures.",
        "However, the extent of this improvement is rarely evaluated as most of the work about semantic similarity is evaluated on datasets such as the WordSim-353 test collection (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007), which are only partially representative of the results for thesaurus building.",
        "If we consider more specifically the problem of improving semantic similarity, and by the way thesauri, in a given paradigm, (Broda et al., 2009), (Zhitomirsky-Geffet and Dagan, 2009) and (Ya-mamoto and Asakura, 2010), which all take place in the paradigm defined by (Grefenstette, 1994), are the closest works to ours.",

        "One main difference between all these works and ours is that they assume that the initial thesaurus was built by relying on distributional contexts represented as bags-of-words.",
        "Our method does not make this assumption as its reranking is based on a classifier built in an unsupervised way7 from and applied to the corpus used for building the initial thesaurus.",

        "If we focus more specifically on the improvement of distributional thesauri, (Ferret, 2012) is the most comparable work to ours, both because it is specifically focused on this task and it is based on the same evaluation framework.",
        "(Ferret, 2012) selects in an unsupervised way a set of positive and negative examples of semantically similar words from the initial thesaurus, uses them for training a classifier deciding whether or not a pair of words are semantically similar and finally, applies this classifier to the neighbors of each entry for reranking them.",
        "One of the objectives of (Ferret, 2012) was to rebalance the initial thesaurus in favor of low frequency entries.",
        "Although this objective was reached, the resulting thesaurus tends to have a lower performance than the initial thesaurus for high frequency entries and for synonyms.",

        "The problem with synonyms 7It is a supervised classifier but its training set is selected in an unsupervised way.",
        "arises from the imbalance between semantic similarity and semantic relatedness among training examples: most of selected examples were pairs of words linked by semantic relatedness because this kind of relations are more frequent among semantic neighbors than relations based on semantic similarity.",
        "In both cases, the method proposed in (Ferret, 2012) faces the problem of relying only on the distributional thesaurus it tries to improve.",
        "This is an important difference with the method presented in this article, which mainly exploits the context of the occurrences of words in the corpus used for the building the initial thesaurus.",
