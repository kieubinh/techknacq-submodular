        "Identifying and understanding entities is a crucial step in understanding text.",
        "This task is more challenging in the presence of multilingual text, because translating named entities (NEs), such as persons, locations, or organizations, is a non-trivial task.",
        "Early research on NE translation used phonetic similarities, for example, to mine the translation ?Mandelson??????",
        "??",
        "[ManDeErSen] with similar sounds.",
        "However, not all NE translations are based on transliterations, as shown in Table 1?Some translations, especially the names of most organizations, are based on semantic equivalences.",
        "Furthermore, names can be abbreviated in one or both languages, e.g., the ?World Trade Organization?",
        "(?",
        "?????)",
        "can be called the ?WTO?",
        "(???",

        "??",
        "??",
        "[ChengLong].",
        "There are many approaches",
        "that deal with some of these challenges (Lam et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2009), e.g., by combining phonetic similarity and a dictionary.",
        "However, arbitrary translations still cannot be handled by examining the NE pair itself.",
        "Corpus-based approaches (Kupiec, 1993; Feng, 2004), by mining external signals from a large corpus, such as parenthetical translation ???",
        "(Jackie Chan)?, complement the problem of transliteration-based approaches, but the coverage of this approach is limited to popular entities with such evidence.",
        "The most effective known approach to NE translation has been a holistic framework (You et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011; You et al., 2012) combining transliteration-and corpus-based methods.",
        "In these approaches, both 1) arbitrary translations and 2) lesser-known entities can be handled, by propagating the translation scores of known entities to lesser-known entities if they co-occur frequently in both corpora.",
        "For example, a lesser-known entity Tom Watson can be translated if Mandelson and Tom Watson co-occur frequently in an English corpus, and their Chinese translations also co-occur frequently in a Chinese corpus, i.e., if the co-occurrences in the two corpora are ?symmetric?.",
        "A research question we ask in this paper is: What if comparable corpora are not comparable enough to support this symmetry assumption?",
        "We found that this is indeed the case.",
        "For example, even English and Chinese news from the same publisher may have different focus?",
        "the Chinese version focuses more on Chinese Olympic",
        "teams and Chinese local news.",
        "In the presence of such asymmetry, all previous approaches, building upon symmetry, quickly deteriorate by propagating false positives.",
        "For example, co-occurrence of Mandelson and Tom Watson may not appear in a Chinese corpus, which may lead to the translation of Tom Watson into another Chinese entity Gordon Brown which happens to co-occur with the Chinese translation of Mandelson.",
        "Our key contribution is to avoid such false propagation, by discerning the semantics of relations.",
        "For example, relations between Mandelson and Tom Watson, should be semantically different from Chinese relations between ???????",
        "(Gordon Brown) and ??????",
        "(Mandelson).",
        "A naive approach would be finding documents with a similar topic such as politics, and scientific discovery, and allowing propagation only when the topic agrees.",
        "However, we found that a topic is a unit that is too coarse for this task because most articles on Mandelson will invariably fall into the same topic1.",
        "In clear contrast, we selectively propagate seed translations, only when the relations in the two corpora share the same semantics.",
        "This selective propagation can be especially effective for translating challenging types of entities such as organizations including theWTO used with and without abbreviation in both languages.",
        "Applying a holistic approach (You et al., 2012) on organizations leads to poor results, 0.06 in terms of the F1-score.",
        "A naive approach to increase the precision would be to consider multi-type co-occurrences, hoping that highly precise translations of some type, e.g., persons with an F1-score of 0.69 (You et al., 2012), can be propagated to boost the precision on organizations.",
        "In our experiments, this naive multi-type propagation still leads to an unsatisfactory F1-score of 0.12.",
        "Such a low score can be explained by the following example.",
        "When translating ?WTO?",
        "using the co-occurrence with ?Mandelson?, other co-occurrences such as (London, Mandelson) and (EU, Mandelson) produce a lot of noise because the right translation of WTO does not share much phonetic/semantic similarity.",
        "Our understanding of relation semantics, can distinguish ?Mandelson was born in London?",
        "from ?Mandelson visited the WTO?, to stop false propagations, which generates an F1-score 0.25 higher than the existing ap",
        "model-based approach was 0.15 lower than our best.",
        "proaches.",
        "More formally, we enable selective propagation of seed translations on weakly comparable corpora, by 1) clarifying the detailed meaning of relational information of co-occurring entities, and 2) identifying the contexts of the relational information using statement-level context comparison.",
        "In other words, we propagate the translation score of a known translation pair to a neighbor pair if the semantics of their relations in English and Chinese corpora are equivalent to accurately propagate the scores.",
        "For example, if we know ?Russia?????",

        "because ??(2?)",

        "and ?Mandelson met Alexei Kudrin?, within the English document and the Chinese document to leverage similar contexts to assure that we use symmetric parts.",
        "For this goal, we first extract relations among entities in documents, such as visit and join, and mine semantically equivalent relations across the languages, e.g., English and Chinese, such as join???.",
        "Once these relation translations are mined, similar document pairs can be identified by comparing each constituent relationship among entities using their relations.",
        "Knowing document similarity improves NE translation, and improved NE translation can boost the accuracy of document and relationship similarity.",
        "This iterative process can continue until convergence.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to translate a broad range of multilingual relations and exploit them to enhance NE translation.",
