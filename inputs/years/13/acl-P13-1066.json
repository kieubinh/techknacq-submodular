        "Online discussion/debate forums allow people with common interests to freely ask and answer questions, to express their views and opinions on any subject matter, and to discuss issues of common interest.",
        "A large part of such discussions is about social, political, and religious issues.",
        "On such issues, there are often heated discussions/debates, i.e., people agree or disagree and argue with one another.",
        "Such ideological discussions on a myriad of social and political issues have practical implications in the fields of communication and political science as they give social scientists an opportunity to study real-life discussions/debates of almost any issue and analyze participant behaviors in a large scale.",
        "In this paper, we present such an application, which aims to perform fine-grained analysis of user-interactions in online discussions.",
        "There have been some related works that focus on discovering the general topics and ideological perspectives in online discussions (Ahmed and Xing, 2010), placing users in support/oppose camps (Agarwal et al., 2003), and classifying user stances (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009).",
        "However, these works are at a rather coarser level and have not considered more fine-grained characteristics of debates/discussions where users interact with each other by quoting/replying each other to express agreement or disagreement and argue with one another.",
        "In this work, we want to mine the following information: 1.",
        "The nature of interaction of each pair of users or participants who have engaged in the discussion of certain issues, i.e., whether the two persons mostly agree or disagree with each other in their interactions.",
        "2.",
        "What language expressions are often used to express agreement (e.g., ?I agree?",
        "and ?you?re right?)",
        "and disagreement (e.g., ?I disagree?",
        "and ?you speak nonsense?).",
        "We note that although agreement and disagreement expressions are distinct from traditional sentiment expressions (words and phrases) such as good, excellent, bad, and horrible, agreement and disagreement clearly express a kind of sentiment as well.",
        "They are usually emitted during interactive exchanges of arguments in ideological discussions.",
        "This idea prompted us to introduce the concept of AD-sentiment.",
        "We define the polarity of agreement expressions as positive and the polarity of disagreement expressions as negative.",
        "We refer agreement and disagreement expressions as AD-sentiment expressions, or AD-expressions for short.",
        "AD-expressions are crucial for the analysis of interactive discussions and debates just as sentiment expressions are instrumental in sentiment analysis (Liu, 2012).",
        "We thus regard this work as an extension to traditional sentiment",
        "analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu, 2012).",
        "In our earlier work (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012a), we proposed three topic models to mine contention points, which also extract AD-expressions.",
        "In this paper, we further improve the work by coupling an information retrieval method to rank good candidate phrases with topic modeling in order to discover more accurate AD-expressions.",
        "Furthermore, we apply the resulting AD-expressions to the new task of classifying the arguing or interaction nature of each pair of users.",
        "Using discovered AD-expressions for classification has an important advantage over traditional classification because they are domain independent.",
        "We employ a semi-supervised generative model called JTE-P to jointly model AD-expressions, pair interactions, and discussion topics simultaneously in a single framework.",
        "With such complex interactions mined, we can produce many useful summaries of discussions.",
        "For example, we can discover the most contentious pairs for each topic and ideological camps of participants, i.e., people who often agree with each other are likely to belong to the same camp.",
        "The proposed framework also facilitates tracking users?",
        "ideology shifts and the resulting arguing nature.",
        "The proposed methods have been evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively using a large number of real-life discussion/debate posts from four domains.",
        "Experimental results show that the proposed model is highly effective in performing its tasks and outperforms several baselines."

        "Sentiment analysis: Sentiment analysis determines positive and negative opinions expressed on entities and aspects (Hu and Liu, 2004).",
        "Main tasks include aspect extraction (Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005), polarity identification (Hassan and Radev, 2010; Choi and Cardie, 2010) and subjectivity analysis (Wiebe, 2000).",
        "As discussed earlier, agreement and disagreement are a special form of sentiments and are different from the sentiment studied in the mainstream research.",
        "Traditional sentiment is mainly expressed with sentiment terms (e.g., great and bad), while agreement and disagreement are inferred by AD-expressions (e.g., I agree and I disagree), which we also call AD-sentiment expressions.",
        "Thus, this work expands the sentiment analysis research.",
        "Topic models: Our work is also related to topic modeling and joint modeling of topics and other information as we jointly model several aspects of discussions/debates.",
        "Topic models like pLSA (Hofmann, 1999) and LDA (Blei et al., 2003) have proved to be very successful in mining topics from large text collections.",
        "There have been various extensions to multi-grain (Titov and McDonald, 2008), labeled (Ramage et al., 2009), and sequential (Du et al., 2010) topic models.",
        "Yet other approaches extend topic models to produce author specific topics (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004), author persona (Mimno and McCallum, 2007), social roles (McCallum et al., 2007), etc.",
        "However, these models do not model debates and hence are unable to discover AD-expressions and interaction natures of author pairs.",
        "Also related are topic models in sentiment analysis which are often referred to as Aspect and Sentiment models (ASMs).",
        "ASMs come in two main flavors: Type-1 ASMs discover aspect (or topic) words sentiment-wise (i.e., discovering positive and negative topic words and sentiments for each topic without separating topic and sentiment terms) (e.g., Lin and He, 2009; Brody and Elhadad, 2010, Jo and Oh, 2011).",
        "Type-2 ASMs separately discover both aspects and sentiments (e.g., Mei et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2010).",
        "Recently, domain knowledge induced ASMs have also been proposed (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012b; Chen et al., 2013).",
        "The generative process of ASMs is, however, different from our model.",
        "Specifically, Type-1 ASMs use asymmetric hyper-parameters for aspects while Type-2 assumes that sentiments and aspects are emitted in the same sentence.",
        "However, AD-expressions are emitted differently.",
