        "Statistical machine translation (SMT) systems usually achieve ?crowd-sourced?",
        "improvements with batch training.",
        "Phrase pair extraction, the key step to discover translation knowledge, heavily relies on the scale of training data.",
        "Typically, the more parallel corpora used, the more phrase pairs and more accurate parameters will be learned, which can obviously be beneficial to improving translation performances.",
        "Today, more parallel sentences are drawn from divergent domains, and the size keeps growing.",
        "Consequently, how to effectively use those data and improve translation performance becomes a challenging issue.",
        "This joint work was done while the first author visited NICT.",
        "Batch retraining is not acceptable for this case, since it demands serious computational overhead when training on a large data set, and it requires us to retrain every time new training data is available.",
        "Even if we can handle the large computation cost, improvement is not guaranteed every time we perform batch tuning on the newly updated training data obtained from divergent domains.",
        "Traditional domain adaption methods for SMT are also not adequate in this scenario.",
        "Most of them have been proposed in order to make translation systems perform better for resource-scarce domains when most training data comes from resource-rich domains, and ignore performance on a more generic domain without domain bias (Wang et al., 2012).",
        "As an alternative, incremental learning may resolve the gap by incrementally adding data sentence-by-sentence into the training data.",
        "Since SMT systems trend to employ very large scale training data for translation knowledge extraction, updating several sentence pairs each time will be annihilated in the existing corpus.",
        "This paper proposes a new phrase table combination method.",
        "First, phrase pairs are extracted from each domain without interfering with other domains.",
        "In particular, we employ the non-parametric Bayesian phrasal inversion transduction grammar (ITG) of Neubig et al. (2011) to perform phrase table extraction.",
        "Second, extracted phrase tables are combined as if they are drawn from a hierarchical Pitman-Yor process, in which the phrase tables represented as tables in the Chinese restaurant process (CRP) are hierarchically chained by treating each of the previously learned phrase tables as prior to the current one.",
        "Thus, we can easily update the chain of phrase tables by appending the newly extracted phrase table and by treating the chain of the previous ones as its prior.",
        "Experiment results indicate that our method can achieve better translation performance when there exists a large divergence in domains, and can",
        "achieve at least comparable results to batch training methods, with a significantly less computational overhead.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we introduce related work.",
        "In section 3, we briefly describe the translation model with phrasal ITGs and Pitman-Yor process.",

        "In the case of the previous work on translation modeling, mixed methods have been investigated for domain adaptation in SMT by adding domain information as additional labels to the original phrase table (Foster and Kuhn, 2007).",
        "Under this framework, the training data is first divided into several parts, and phase pairs are extracted with some sub-domain features.",
        "Then all the phrase pairs and features are tuned together with different weights during decoding.",
        "As a way to choose the right domain for the domain adap-tion, a classifier-based method and a feature-based method have been proposed.",
        "Classification-based methods must at least add an explicit label to indicate which domain the current phrase pair comes from.",
        "This is traditionally done with an automatic domain classifier, and each input sentence is classified into its corresponding domain (Xu et al., 2007).",
        "As an alternative to the classification-based approach, Wang et al. (2012) employed a feature-based approach, in which phrase pairs are enriched by a feature set to potentially reflect the domain information.",
        "The similarity calculated by a information retrieval system between the training subset and the test set is used as a feature for each parallel sentence (Lu et al., 2007).",
        "Monolingual topic information is taken as a new feature for a domain adaptive translation model and tuned on the development set (Su et al., 2012).",
        "Regardless of underlying methods, either classifier-based or feature-based method, the performance of current domain adaptive phrase extraction methods is more sensitive to the development set selection.",
        "Usually the domain similar to a given development data is usually assigned higher weights.",
        "Incremental learning in which new parallel sentences are incrementally updated to the training data is employed for SMT.",
        "Compared to traditional frequent batch oriented methods, an online EM algorithm and active learning are applied to phrase pair extraction and achieves almost comparable translation performance with less computational overhead (Levenberg et al., 2010; Gonza?lez-Rubio et al., 2011).",
        "However, their methods usually require numbers of hyperparameters, such as mini-batch size, step size, or human judgment to determine the quality of phrases, and still rely on a heuristic phrase extraction method in each phrase table update."

        "The model learned from the domain more similar to the test data is placed in the front so that it can largely influence the parameter computation with less backoff effects.",
        "There is a big difference between the two opposite order in IWSLT 2012 data set, in which more than one point of decline in BLEU score when taking the BTEC corpus as the first layer.",
        "Note that the perplexity of BTEC was 344.589 while that of HIT was 107.788.",
        "The result may indicate that our hierarchical phrase combination method is sensitive to the integration order when the training data is small and there exists large gap in the similarity.",
        "However, if most domains are similar (FBIS data set) or if there are enough parallel sentence pairs (NIST data set) in each domain, then the translation performances are almost similar even with the opposite integrating orders."
