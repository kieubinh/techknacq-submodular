        "In automatic summarization, centrality has been one of the guiding principles for content selection in extractive systems.",
        "We define centrality to be the idea that a summary should contain the parts of the source text that are most similar or representative of the source text.",
        "This is most transparently illustrated by the Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) system of Carbonell and Goldstein (1998), which defines the summarization objective to be a linear combination of a centrality term and a non-redundancy term.",
        "Since MMR, much progress has been made on more sophisticated methods of measuring centrality and integrating it with non-redundancy (See Nenkova and McKeown (2011) for a recent survey).",
        "For example, term weighting methods such as the signature term method of Lin and Hovy (2000) pick out salient terms that occur more often than would be expected in the source text based on frequencies in a background corpus.",
        "This method is a core component of the most successful summarization methods (Conroy et al., 2006).",
        "While extractive methods based on centrality have thus achieved success, there has long been recognition that abstractive methods are ultimately more desirable.",
        "One line of work is in text simplification and sentence fusion, which focus on the ability of abstraction to achieve a higher compression ratio (Knight and Marcu, 2000; Barzilay and McKeown, 2005).",
        "A less examined issue is that of aggregation and information synthesis.",
        "A key part of the usefulness of summaries is that they provide some synthesis or analysis of the source text and make a more general statement that is of direct relevance to the user.",
        "For example, a series of related events can be aggregated and expressed as a trend.",
        "The position of this paper is that centrality is not enough to make substantial progress towards abstractive summarization that is capable of this type of semantic inference.",
        "Instead, summarization systems need to make more use of domain knowledge.",
        "We provide evidence for this in a series of studies on the TAC 2010 guided summarization data set that examines how the behaviour of automatic summarizers can or cannot be distinguished from human summarizers.",
        "First, we confirm that abstraction is a desirable goal, and",
        "provide a quantitative measure of the degree of sentence aggregation in a summarization system.",
        "Second, we show that centrality-based measures are unlikely to lead to substantial progress towards abstractive summarization, because current top-performing systems already produce summaries that are more ?central?",
        "than humans do.",
        "Third, we consider how domain knowledge may be useful as a resource for an abstractive system, by showing that key parts of model summaries can be reconstructed from the source plus related in-domain documents.",
        "Our contributions are novel in the following respects.",
        "First, our analyses are performed at the level of caseframes, rather at the level of words or syntactic dependencies as in previous work.",
        "Case-frames are shallow approximations of semantic roles which are well suited to characterizing a domain by its slots.",
        "Furthermore, we take a developmental rather than evaluative perspective?our goal is not to develop a new evaluation measure as defined by correlation with human responsiveness judgments.",
        "Instead, our studies reveal useful criteria with which to distinguish human-written and system summaries, helping to guide the development of future summarization systems."

        "Domain-dependent template-based summarization systems have been an alternative to extractive systems which make use of rich knowledge about a domain and information extraction techniques to generate a summary, possibly using a natural language generation system (Radev and McKeown, 1998; White et al., 2001; McKeown et al., 2002).",
        "This paper can be seen as a first step towards reconciling the advantages of domain knowledge with the resource-lean extraction approaches popular today.",
        "As noted above, Lin and Hovy's (2000) signature terms have been successful in discovering terms that are specific to the source text.",
        "These terms are identified by a log-likelihood ratio test based on their relative frequencies in relevant and irrelevant documents.",
        "They were originally proposed in the context of single-document summarization, where they were calculated using in-domain (relevant) vs. out-of-domain (irrelevant) text.",
        "In multi-document summarization, the in-domain text has been replaced by the source text cluster (Conroy et al., 2006), thus they are now used as a form of centrality-based features.",
        "In this paper, we use guided summarization data as an opportunity to reopen the investigation into the effect of domain, because multiple document clusters from the same domain are available.",
        "Summarization evaluation is typically done by comparing system output to human-written model summaries, and are validated by their correlation with user responsiveness judgments.",
        "The comparison can be done at the word level, as in ROUGE (Lin, 2004), at the syntactic level, as in Basic Elements (Hovy et al., 2006), or at the level of summary content units, as in the Pyramid method (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004).",
        "There are also automatic measures which do not require model summaries, but compare against the source text instead (Louis and Nenkova, 2009; Saggion et al., 2010).",
        "Several studies complement this paper by examining the best possible extractive system using current evaluation measures, such as ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003; Conroy et al., 2006).",

        "We have presented a series of studies to distinguish human-written informative summaries from the summaries produced by current systems.",
        "Our studies are performed at the level of caseframes, which are able to characterize a domain in terms of its slots.",
        "First, we confirm that model summaries are more abstractive and aggregate information from multiple source text sentences.",
        "Then, we show that this is not simply due to summary writers packing together source text sentences containing topical caseframes to achieve a higher compression ratio, even if paraphrasing is taken into account.",
        "Indeed, model summaries cannot be reconstructed from the source text alone.",
        "However, our results are also positive in that we find that nearly all model summary caseframes can be found in the source text together with some in-domain documents.",
        "Current summarization systems have been heavily optimized towards centrality and lexical-semantical reasoning, but we are nearing the bottom of the barrel.",
        "Domain inference, on the other hand, and a greater use of in-domain documents as a knowledge source for domain inference, are very promising indeed.",
        "Mining useful caseframes",
        "for a sentence fusion-based approach has the potential, as our experiments have shown, to deliver results in just the areas where current approaches are weakest."
