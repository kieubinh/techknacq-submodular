        "It is also compelling to consider ways in which web-mined data obtained from scratch could be used to bootstrap other mining approaches.",
        "For example, Smith et al. (2010) mine parallel sentences from comparable documents in Wikipedia, demonstrating substantial gains on open domain translation.",
        "However, their approach required seed parallel data to learn models used in a classifier.",
        "We imagine a two-step process, first obtaining parallel data from the web, followed by comparable data from sources such as Wikipedia using models bootstrapped from the web-mined data.",
        "Such a process could be used to build translation systems for new language pairs in a very short period of time, hence fulfilling one of the original promises of SMT."
