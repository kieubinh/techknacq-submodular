        "During the last decade, statistical machine translation has made great progress.",
        "Novel translation models, such as phrase-based models (Koehn et al., 2007), hierarchical phrase-based models (Chiang, 2007) and linguistically syntax-based models (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006; Galley, 2006; Zhang et al. 2008; Chiang, 2010; Zhang et al., 2011; Zhai et al., 2011, 2012) have been proposed and achieved higher and higher translation performance.",
        "However, all of these state-of-the-art translation models rely on the parallel corpora to induce translation rules and estimate the corresponding parameters.",
        "It is unfortunate that the parallel corpora are very expensive to collect and are usually not available for resource-poor languages and for many specific domains even in a resource-rich language pair.",
        "Recently, more and more researchers concentrated on taking full advantage of the monolingual corpora in both source and target languages, and proposed methods for bilingual lexicon induction from non-parallel data (Rapp, 1995, 1999; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Haghighi et al., 2008; Daumé III and Jagarlamudi, 2011) and proposed unsupervised statistical machine translation (bilingual lexicon is a byproduct) with only monolingual corpora (Ravi and Knight, 2011; Nuhn et al., 2012; Dou and Knight, 2012).",
        "In the bilingual lexicon induction (Koehn and Knight, 2002; Haghighi et al., 2008; Daumé III and Jagarlamudi, 2011), with the help of the orthographic and context features, researchers adopted an unsupervised method, such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) model, to automatically induce the word translation pairs between two languages from non-parallel data only requiring that the monolingual data in each language are from a fairly comparable domain.",
        "The unsupervised statistical machine translation method (Ravi and Knight, 2011; Nuhn et al., 2012; Dou and Knight, 2012) viewed the translation task as a decipherment problem and designed a generative model with the objective function to maximize the likelihood of the source language monolingual data.",
        "To tackle the large-scale vocabulary, they mainly considered the word-based model (e.g. IBM Model 3) and applied the Bayesian method with Gibbs sampling or slice sampling.",
        "Finally, they used the learned translation model directly to translate unseen data (Ravi and Knight, 2011; Nuhn et al., 2012) or incorporated the learned bilingual lexicon as a new in-domain translation resource into the phrase-based model which is trained with out-of-domain data to improve the domain adaptation performance in machine translation (Dou and Knight, 2012).",
        "We can easily see that these unsupervised methods can only induce the word-based translation rules (bilingual lexicon) at present.",

        "In this paper, we focus on exploring this direction and propose a simple but effective method to induce the phrase-level translation rules from monolingual data.",
        "The main idea of our method is to divide the phrase-level translation rule induction into two steps: bilingual lexicon induction and phrase pair induction.",
        "Since many researchers have studied the bilingual lexicon induction, in this paper, we mainly concentrate ourselves on phrase pair induction given a probabilistic bilingual lexicon and two in-domain large monolingual data (source and target language).",
        "In addition, we will further introduce how to refine the induced phrase pairs and estimate the parameters of the induced phrase pairs, such as four standard translation features and phrase reordering feature used in the conventional phrase-based models (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "The induced phrase-based model will be used to help domain adaptation for machine translation.",
        "In the rest of this paper, we first explain with examples to show what new translation knowledge can be learned with our proposed phrase pair induction method (Section 2), and then we introduce the approach for probabilistic bilingual lexicon acquisition in Section 3.",
        "In Section 4 and 5, we respectively present our method for phrase pair induction and introduce an approach for phrase pair refinement and parameter estimation.",
        "Section 6 will show the detailed experiments for the task of domain adaptation.",

        "The noise of the lexicon can influence the accuracy of the induced phrase pairs to a large extent.",

        "With the source language data and its translation, we estimate the bidirectional translation probabilities for each entry in the original lexicon.",

        "There are three research works that are most related with ours.",
        "One is using an in-domain probabilistic bilingual lexicon to extract sub-sentential parallel fragments from comparable corpora (Munteanu and Marcu, 2006; Quirk et al., 2007; Cettolo et al., 2010).",
        "Munteanu and Marcu (2006) first extract the candidate parallel sentences from the comparable corpora and further extract the accurate sub-sentential bilingual fragments from the candidate parallel sentences using the in-domain probabilistic bilingual lexicon.",
        "Compared with their work, our focus is to induce phrase pairs directly from monolingual data rather than comparable data.",
        "Thus, finding the candidate parallel sentences is not possible in our situation.",
        "Another is to make full use of monolingual data with transductive learning (Ueffing et al., 2007; Schwenk, 2008; Wu et al., 2008; Bertoldi and Federico, 2009).",
        "For the target-side monolingual data, they just use it to train language model, and for the source-side monolingual data, they employ a baseline (word-based SMT or phrase-based SMT trained with small-scale bitext) to first translate the source sentences, combining the source sentence and its target translation as a bilingual sentence pair, and then train a new phrase-base SMT with these pseudo sentence pairs.",
        "This method cannot learn idiom translations and unknown word translations.",
        "The third is to estimate the translation parameters and reordering parameters using monolingual data given the phrase pairs (Klementiev et al., 2012).",
        "Their work supposes the phrase pairs are already given and then corresponding parameters can be learned with monolingual data.",
        "Different from their work, we concentrate ourselves on inducing phrase pairs from monolingual data and then borrow some ideas from theirs for parameter estimation.",
        "Furthermore, we extend their contextual similarity between source and target phrases to both directions."

        "For the out-of-domain data, we build the phrase table and reordering table using the 2.08 million Chinese-to-English sentence pairs, and we use the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) to train the 5-gram English language model with the target part of the parallel sentences and the Xinhua portion of the English Gigaword.",
        "For the in-domain electronic data, we first consider the lexicon as a phrase table in which we assign a constant 1.0 for each of the four probabilities, and then we combine this initial phrase table and the induced phrase pairs to form the new phrase table.",
