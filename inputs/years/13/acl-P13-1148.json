        "This allows their architecture to handle virtually arbitrary pronunciation variation.",
        "However, as they point out, combining the segmentation and the variation model into one joint model is not straightforward and usual inference procedures are infeasible, which requires the use of several heuristics.",
        "We pursue an alternative research strategy here, starting with a single well-studied example of phonological variation.",
        "This permits us to develop a joint generative model for both word segmentation and variation which we plan to extend to handle more phenomena in future work.",

        "/t/-deletion has received a lot of attention within linguistics, and we point the interested reader to Coetzee (2004, Chapter 5) for a thorough review.",
        "Briefly, the phenomenon is as follows: word-final instances of /t/ may undergo deletion in natural speech, such that /wEst/ ?west?",
        "is actually pronounced as [wEs] ?wes?.2 While the frequency of this phenomenon varies across social and dialectal groups, within groups it has been found to be robust, and the probability of deletion depends on its phonological context: a /t/ is more likely to be dropped when followed by a consonant than a vowel or a pause, and it is more likely to be dropped when following a consonant than a vowel as well.",
        "We point out two recent publications that are of direct relevance to our research.",
        "Dilley et al. (to appear) study word-final variation in stop consonants in CDS, the kind of input we ideally would like to evaluate our models on.",

(2009) that without annealing, the Bigram model gets stuck in suboptimal parts of the solution space early on.",
        "During the annealing stage, we prevent the model from performing inference for underlying /t/s so that the annealing stage can be seen as an elaborate initialisation scheme, and we perform joint inference for the remaining 500 iterations, evaluating on the last sample and averaging over two runs.",
        "As neither the Unigram nor the Bigram model performs ?perfect?",
        "word segmentation, we expect to see a degradation in /t/-recovery performance and this is what we find indeed.",
        "To give an impression of the impact of /t/-deletion, we also report numbers for running only the segmentation model on the Buckeye data with no deleted /t/s and on the data with deleted /t/s.",
        "The /t/-recovery scores are given in Table 5 and segmentation scores in Table 6.",
        "Again the Unigram model's /t/-recovery score degrades dramatically in the LEARN-?",
        "condition.",
        "Looking at the segmentation performance this isn't too surprising: the Unigram model's poorer token F-score, the standard measure of segmentation performance on a word token level, suggests that it misses many more boundaries than the Bigram model to begin with and, consequently, can't recover any potential underlying /t/s at these boundaries.",
        "Also note that in the GOLD-?",
        "condition, our joint Bigram model performs almost as well on data with /t/-deletions as the word segmentation model on data that includes no variation at all.",
        "The generally worse performance of handling variation as measured by /t/-recovery F-score when performing joint segmentation is consistent with the finding of Elsner et al. (2012) who report considerable performance drops for their phonological learner when working with induced boundaries (note, however, that their model does not perform joint inference, rather the induced boundaries are given to their phonological learner as ground-truth)."

        "There are two interesting findings from our experiments.",
        "First of all, we find a much larger difference between the Unigram and the Bigram model in the LEARN-?",
        "condition than in the GOLD-?",
        "condition.",
        "We suggest that this is due to the Unigram model's lack of dependencies between underlying forms, depriving it of an important source of evidence.",
        "Bigram dependencies provide additional evidence for underlying /t/ that are deleted on the surface, and because the Bigram model identifies these underlying /t/ more accurately, it can also estimate the /t/ deletion probability more accurately.",
        "recovery F-scores in Table 5 averaged over two runs (standard errors less than 2% unless given).",
        "NO-?",
        "are scores for running just the word segmentation model with no /t/-deletion rule on the data that includes /t/-deletion, NO-VAR for running just the word segmentation model on the data with no /t/-deletions.",
        "For example, /t/ dropping in ?don't you?",
        "yields surface forms ?don you?.",
        "Because the word bigram probability P (you |don't) is high, the bigram model prefers to analyse surface ?don?",
        "as underlying ?don't?.",
        "The Unigram model does not have access to word bigram information so the underlying forms it posits are less accurate (as shown in Table 2), and hence the estimate of the /t/-deletion probability is also less accurate.",
        "When the probabilities of deletion are pre-specified the Unigram model performs better but still considerably worse than the Bigram model when the word boundaries are known, suggesting the importance of non-phonological contextual effects that the Bigram model but not the Unigram model can capture.",
        "This suggests that for example word predictability in context might be an important factor contributing to /t/-deletion.",
        "The other striking finding is the considerable drop in performance between running on naturalistic and artificially created data.",
        "This suggests that the natural distribution of /t/-deletion is much more complex than can be captured by statistics over the phonological contexts we examined.",
        "Following Guy (1991), a finer-grained distinction for the preceeding segments might address this problem.",
        "Yet another suggestion comes from the recent work in Coetzee and Kawahara (2013) who claim that ?",
        "[a] model that accounts perfectly for the overall rate of application of some variable process therefore does not necessarily account very well for the actual application of the process to individual words.?",
        "They argue that in particular the extremely high deletion rates typical of high frequency items aren't accurately captured when the deletion probability is estimated across all types.",
        "A look at the error patterns of our model on a sample from the Bigram model in the LEARN-?",
        "setting on the naturalistic data suggests that this is in fact a problem.",
        "For example, the word ?just?",
        "has an extremely high rate of deletion with 17462442 = 0.71%.While many tokens of ?jus?",
        "are ?explained away?",
        "through predicting underlying /t/s, the (literally) extraordinary frequency of ?jus?-tokens lets our model still posit it as an underlying form, although with a much dampened frequency (of the 1746 surface tokens, 1081 are analysed as being realizations of an underlying ?just?).",
        "The /t/-recovery performance drop when performing joint word segmentation isn't surprising as even the Bigram model doesn't deliver a very high-quality segmentation to begin with, leading to both sparsity (through missed word-boundaries) and potential noise (through misplaced word-boundaries).",
        "Using a more realistic generative process for the underlying forms, for example an Adaptor Grammar (Johnson et al., 2007), could address this shortcoming in future work without changing the overall architecture of the model although novel inference algorithms might be required."

        "We presented a joint model for word segmentation and the learning of phonological rule probabilities from a corpus of transcribed speech.",
        "We find that our Bigram model reaches 77% /t/-recovery F-score when run with knowledge of true word-boundaries and when it can make use of both the preceeding and the following phonological context, and that unlike the Unigram model it is able to learn the probability of /t/-deletion in different contexts.",
        "When performing joint word segmentation on the Buckeye corpus, our Bigram model reaches around above 55% F-score for recovering deleted /t/s with a word segmentation F-score of around 72% which is 2% better than running a Bigram model that does not model /t/-deletion.",
        "We identified additional factors that might help handling /t/-deletion and similar phenomena.",
        "A major advantage of our generative model is the ease and transparency with which its assumptions can be modified and extended.",
        "For future work we plan to incorporate into our model richer phonological contexts, item-and frequency-specific probabilities and more direct use of word",
        "predictability.",
        "We also plan to extend our model to handle additional phenomena, an obvious candidate being /d/-deletion.",
        "Also, the two-level architecture we present is not limited to the mapping being defined in terms of rules rather than constraints in the spirit of Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky, 2004); we plan to explore this alternative path as well in future work.",
        "To conclude, we presented a model that provides a clean framework to test the usefulness of different factors for word segmentation and handling phonological variation in a controlled manner."
