        "The explicit sentiment expression, happy, is positive.",
        "Yet (according to the writer), the people are negative toward Chavez.",
        "As noted by (Wilson and Wiebe, 2005), the attitude toward Chavez is inferred from the explicit sentiment toward the event.",
        "An opinion-mining system that recognizes only explicit sentiments would not be able to perceive the negative attitude toward Chavez conveyed in (1).",
        "Such inferences must be addressed for NLP systems to be able to recognize the full range of opinions conveyed in language.",
        "The inferences arise from interactions between sentiment expressions and events such as fallen, which negatively affect entities (malefactive events), and events such as help, which positively affect entities (benefactive events).",
        "While some corpora have been annotated for explicit opinion expressions (for example, (Kessler et al., 2010; Wiebe et al., 2005)), there isn't a previously published corpus annotated for benefactive/malefactive events.",
        "While (Anand and Reschke, 2010) conducted a related annotation study, their data are artificially constructed sentences incorporating event predicates from a fixed list, and their annotations are of the writer's attitude toward the events.",

        "For ease of communication, we use the terms goodFor and badFor for benefactive and malefactive events, respectively, and use the abbreviation gfbf for an event that is one or the other.",
        "There are many varieties of gfbf events, including destruction (as in kill Bill, which is bad for Bill), creation (as in bake a cake, which is good for the cake), gain or loss (as in increasing costs, which is good for the costs), and benefit or injury (as in comforted the child, which is good for the child) (Anand and Reschke, 2010).",
        "The scheme targets clear cases of gfbf events.",
        "The event must be representable as a triple of contiguous text spans, ?agent, gfbf, object?.",
        "The agent must be a noun phrase, or it may be implicit (as in the constituent will be destroyed).",
        "The object must be a noun phrase.",
        "Another component of the scheme is the influencer, a word whose effect is to either retain or reverse the polarity of a gfbf event.",

        "(2) Luckily Bill didn't kill him.",
        "(3) The reform prevented companies from hurting patients.",
        "(4) John helped Mary to save Bill.",

        "In (4), helped is an influencer which retains the polarity (i.e., helping Mary to save Bill is good for Bill).",
        "Examples (3) and (4) illustrate the case where an influencer introduces an additional agent (reform in (3) and John in (4)).",
        "The agent of an influencer must be a noun phrase or implicit.",
        "The object must be another influencer or a gfbf event.",
        "Note that, semantically, an influencer can be seen as good for or bad for its object.",
        "A reverser influencer makes its object irrealis (i.e., not happen).",
        "Thus, it is bad for it.",
        "In (3), for example, prevent is bad for the hurting event.",
        "A retainer influencer maintains its object, and thus is good for it.",
        "In (4), for example, helped maintains the saving event.",
        "For this reason, influencers and gfbf events are sometimes combined in the evaluations presented below (see Section 4.2).",

        "Turning to influencers, there may be chains of them, where the ultimate polarity and agent must be determined compositionally.",
