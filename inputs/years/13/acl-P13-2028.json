        "Post-retrieval clustering (PRC), also known as search results clustering or ephemeral clustering, is the task of clustering Web search results.",
        "For a given query, the retrieved Web snippets are automatically clustered and presented to the user with meaningful labels in order to minimize the information search process.",
        "This technique can be particularly useful for polysemous queries but it is hard to implement efficiently and effectively (Carpineto et al., 2009).",
        "Indeed, as opposed to classical text clustering, PRC must deal with small collections of short text fragments (Web snippets) and be processed in run-time.",
        "As a consequence, most of the successful methodologies follow a monothetic approach (Za-mir and Etzioni, 1998; Ferragina and Gulli, 2008; Carpineto and Romano, 2010; Navigli and Crisa-fulli, 2010; Scaiella et al., 2012).",
        "The underlying idea is to discover the most discriminant topical words in the collection and group together Web snippets containing these relevant terms.",
        "On the other hand, the polythetic approach which main idea is to represent Web snippets as word feature vectors has received less attention, the only relevant work being (Osinski and Weiss, 2005).",
        "The main reasons for this situation are that (1) word feature vectors are hard to define in small collections of short text fragments (Timonen, 2013), (2) existing second-order similarity measures such as the cosine are unadapted to capture the semantic similarity between small texts, (3) Latent Semantic Analysis has evidenced inconclusive results (Osinski and Weiss, 2005) and (4) the la-beling process is a surprisingly hard extra task (Carpineto et al., 2009).",
        "This paper is motivated by the fact that the polythetic approach should lead to improved results if correctly applied to small collections of short text fragments.",
        "For that purpose, we propose a new methodology that adapts the classical K-means algorithm to a third-order similarity measure initially developed for Topic Segmentation (Dias et al., 2007).",
        "Moreover, the adapted K-means algorithm allows to label each cluster directly from its centroids thus avoiding the abovementioned extra task.",
        "Finally, the evolution of the objective function of the adapted K-means is modeled to automatically define the ?best?",
        "number of clusters.",
        "Finally, we propose different experiments over the ODP-239 (Carpineto and Romano, 2010) and MORESQUE (Navigli and Crisafulli, 2010) datasets against the most competitive text-based PRC algorithms: STC (Zamir and Etzioni, 1998), LINGO (Osinski and Weiss, 2005), OPTIMSRC (Carpineto and Romano, 2010) and the classical bisecting incremental K-means (which may be seen as a baseline for the polythetic paradigm)1.",
