        "There has been a rise in the phenomenon of ?code mixing?",
        "(Romaine and Kachru, 1992).",
        "This is a phenomenon where lexical items of two languages appear in a single sentence.",
        "In a multilingual country such as India, we commonly find Indian language text being freely interspersed with English words and phrases.",
        "This is particularly noticeable in the case of text from web sources like blogs, tweets etc.",
        "An informal analysis of a Telugu blog on the web showed that around 20-30% of the text is in English (ASCII) while the remaining is in Telugu (Unicode).",
        "Due to the growth of ?code mixing?",
        "it has become necessary to develop strategies for dealing with such multilingual text in TTS systems.",
        "These multilingual TTS systems should be capable of synthesizing utterances which contain foreign language words or word groups, without sounding unnatural.",
        "The different ways of achieving multilingual TTS synthesis are as follows (Traber et al., 1999; Latorre et al., 2006; Campbell, 1998; Campbell, 2001).",

        "In this paradigm, a seperate TTS system is built for each language under consideration.",
        "When the language of the input text changes, the TTS system also has to be changed.",

        "This method involves recording a multi language speech corpus by someone who is fluent in multiple languages.",
        "This speech corpus is then used to build a multilingual TTS system.",
        "The primary issue with polyglot speech synthesis is that it requires development of a combined phoneset, incorporating phones from all the languages under consideration.",

      "text": [
        "This type of multilingual synthesis is based upon phone mapping, whereby the phones of the foreign language are substituted with the closest sounding phones of the primary language.",
        "This method results in a strong foreign accent while synthesizing the foreign words.",
        "This may not always be acceptable.",
        "Also, if the sequence of the mapped phones does not exist or is not frequently occurring in the primary language, then the synthesized output quality would be poor.",
        "Hence, an average polyglot synthesis technique using HMM based synthesis and speaker adaptation has been proposed (Latorre et al., 2006).",

        "Specifically, we investigate methods of pronouncing English words using Telugu phoneset in the context of Telugu Text-to-Speech.",
        "Our motivation for doing so, comes from our understanding of how humans pronounce foreign words while speaking.",
        "The speaker maps the foreign words to a sequence of phones of his/her native language while pronouncing that foreign word.",
        "For example, a native speaker of Telugu, while pronouncing an English word, mentally maps the English word to a sequence of Telugu phones as opposed to simply substituting English phones with the corresponding Telugu phones.",
        "Also, the receiver of the synthesized speech would be a Telugu native speaker, who may not have the knowledge of English phone set.",
        "Hence, approximating an English word using Telugu phone sequence may be more acceptable for a Telugu native speaker.",
        "We compare phone-phone substitution and word-phone mapping (also referred to LTS rules) for the pronunciation of English words using Telugu phones.",
