        "Humans can construct a broad range of descriptions for almost any object or event.",
        "In this paper, we will refer to such objects or events as groundings, in the sense of grounded semantics.",
        "Examples of groundings include pictures (Rashtchian et al., 2010), videos (Chen and Dolan, 2011), translations of a sentence from another language (Dreyer and Marcu, 2012), or even paraphrases of the same sentence (Barzilay and Lee, 2003).",
        "One crucial problem is recognizing whether novel utterances are relevant descriptions of those groundings.",
        "In the case of machine translation, this is the evaluation problem; for images and videos, this is recognition and retrieval.",
        "Generating descriptions of events is also often an interesting task: we might like to find a novel paraphrase for a given sentence, or generate a description of a grounding that meets certain criteria (e.g., brevity, use of a restricted vocabulary).",
        "Much prior work has used lattices to compactly represent a range of lexical choices (Pang et al., 2003).",
        "However, lattices cannot compactly represent alternate word orders, a common occurrence in linguistic descriptions.",
        "Consider the following excerpts from a video description corpus (Chen and Dolan, 2011): ?",
        "A man is sliding a cat on the floor.",
        "?",
        "A boy is cleaning the floor with the cat.",
        "?",
        "A cat is being pushed across the floor by a man.",
        "Ideally we would like to recognize that the following utterance is also a valid description of that event: A cat is being pushed across the floor by a boy.",
        "That is difficult with lattice representations.",
        "Consider the following context free grammar:",
        "This grammar compactly captures many lexical and syntactic variants of the input set.",
        "Note how the labels act as a kind of multiple-sequence-alignment allowing reordering: spans of tokens covered by the same label are, in a sense, aligned.",
        "This hypergraph or grammar represents a semantic neighborhood: a set of utterances that describe the same entity in a semantic space.",
        "Semantic neighborhoods are defined in terms of a grounding.",
        "Two utterances are neighbors with respect to some grounding (semantic event) if they are both descriptions of that grounding.",
        "Paraphrases, in contrast, may be defined over all possible groundings.",
        "That is, two words or phrases",
        "are considered paraphrases if there exists some grounding that they both describe.",
        "The paraphrase relation is more permissive than the semantic neighbor relation in that regard.",
        "We believe that it is much easier to define and evaluate semantic neighbors.",
        "Human annotators may have difficulty separating paraphrases from unrelated or merely related utterances, and this line may not be consistent between judges.",
        "Annotating whether an utterance clearly describes a grounding is a much easier task.",
        "This paper describes a simple method for constructing hypergraph-shaped Semantic Neighborhoods from sets of expressions describing the same grounding.",
        "The method is evaluated in a paraphrase recognition task, inspired by a CAPTCHA task (Von Ahn et al., 2003)."

        "Here, we search for a grammar over the fluent and adequate descriptions of a particular input.",
        "Many of the same techniques still apply.",
        "Rather than starting from scratch, we bootstrap from an existing English parser.",
        "We begin by parsing the set of input utterances.",
        "This parsed set of utterances acts as a sort of treebank.",
        "Reading off a grammar from this treebank produces a grammar that can generate not only the seed sentences, but also a broad range of nearby sentences.",
        "In the case above with cat, man, and boy, we would be able to generate cases legitimate variants where man was replaced by boy as well as undesired variants where man is replaced by cat or floor.",
        "This initial grammar captures a large neighborhood of nearby utterances including many such undesirable ones.",
        "Therefore, we refine the grammar.",
        "Refinements have been in common use in syntactic parsing for years now.",
        "Inspired by the result that manual annotations of Treebank categories can substantially increase parser accuracy (Klein and Manning, 2003), several approaches have been introduced to automatically induce latent symbols on existing trees.",
        "We use the split-merge method commonly used in syntactic parsing (Petrov et al., 2006).",
        "In its original setting, the refinements captured details beyond that of the original Penn Treebank symbols.",
        "Here, we capture both syntactic and semantic regularities in the descriptions of a given grounding.",
        "As we perform more rounds of refinement, the grammar becomes tightly constrained to the original sentences.",
        "Indeed, if we iterated to a fixed point, the resulting grammar would parse only the original sentences.",
        "This is a common dilemma in paraphrase learning: the safest meaning preserving rewrite is to change nothing.",

        "This randomness prevents EM from starting on a saddle point by breaking symmetries; Petrov et al. describe this in more detail.",
        "Merge: After EM has run to completion, we have a new grammar with twice as many symbols and eight times as many rules.",
        "Many of these symbols may not be necessary, however.",
        "For instance, nouns may require substantial refinement to distinguish a number of different actors and objects, where determiners might not require much refinement at all.",

        "Another critical issue, especially in these small grammars, is smoothing.",
        "When parsing with a grammar obtained from only 20 to 50 sentences, we are very likely to encounter words that have never been seen before.",
        "We may reasonably reject such sentences under the assumption that they are describing words not present in the training corpus.",

        "Since the small grammars in our evaluation below seldom exhibit self-embedding (latent state identification",
