        "The translation selection task may also be modified slightly to output a ranked list of translations.",
        "This then resembles a dictionary lookup process as performed by a human reader when reading or browsing a text written in a second or foreign language.",
        "For convenience's sake, we will call this task (as performed via computational means) context-dependent lexical lookup.",
        "It can also be viewed as a simplified version of the Cross-Lingual Lexical Substitution (Mihalcea et al., 2010) and Cross-Lingual Word Sense Disambiguation (Lefever and Hoste, 2010) tasks, as defined in SemEval-2010.",
        "There is a large body of work around WSD and translation selection.",
        "However, many of these approaches require lexical resources or large bilingual corpora with rich information fields and annotations, as reviewed in section 2.",
        "Unfortunately, not all languages have equal amounts of digital resources for developing language technologies, and such requirements are often infeasible for under-resourced languages.",
        "We are interested in leveraging richer-resourced language pairs to enable context-dependent lexical lookup for under-resourced languages.",
        "For this purpose, we model translation context knowledge as a second-order co-occurrence bag-of-words model.",
        "We propose a rapid approach for acquiring them from an untagged, comparable bilingual corpus of a (richer-resourced) language pair in section 3.",
        "This information is then transferred into a multilingual lexicon to perform context-dependent lexical lookup on input texts, including those in an under-resourced language (section 4).",
        "Section 5 describes a prototype implementation, where translation context knowledge is extracted from a English?Malay bilingual corpus to enrich a multilingual lexicon with six languages.",
