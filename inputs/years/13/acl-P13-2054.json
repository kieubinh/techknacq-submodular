        "Apart from the resource-scarcity problem, its diversity ?in both dialect and writing systems?",
        "is another primary challenge in Kurdish language processing (Gautier, 1998; Gautier, 1996; Esmaili, 2012).",
        "In fact, Kurdish is considered a bi-standard language (Gautier, 1998; Hassanpour et al., 2012): the Sorani dialect written in an Arabic-based alphabet and the Kurmanji dialect written in a Latin-based alphabet.",
        "The features distinguishing these two dialects are phonological, lexical, and morphological.",

        "Next, after presenting the Pewan text corpus in Section 3, we use it to conduct a statistical comparison of the two dialects in Section 4.",
