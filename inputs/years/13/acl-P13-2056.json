        "Most NLP studies focused on limited languages with large sets of annotated data.",
        "English and Chinese are examples of these resource-rich languages.",
        "Unfortunately, it is impossible to build sufficient labeled data for all tasks in all languages.",
        "To address NLP tasks in resource-scarce languages, cross-lingual projection methods were proposed, which make use of existing resources in resource-rich language (also called source language) to help NLP tasks in resource-scarce language (also named as target language).",
        "There are several types of projection methods.",
        "One intuitive and effective method is to build a common feature space for all languages, so that the model trained on one language could be directly used on other languages (McDonald et al., 2011; Ta?ckstro?m et al., 2012).",
        "We call it direct projection, which becomes very popular recently.",
        "The main limitation of these methods is that target language has to be similar to source language.",
        "Otherwise the performance will degrade especially when the orders of phrases between source and target languages differ a lot.",
        "Another common type of projection methods map labels from resource-rich language sentences to resource-scarce ones in a parallel corpus using word alignment information (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Hwa et al., 2005; Das and Petrov, 2011).",
        "We refer them as projection based on word alignments in this paper.",
        "Compared to other types of projection methods, this type of methods is more robust to syntactic differences between languages since it trained models on the target side thus following the topology of the target language.",
        "This paper aims to build an accurate projection method with strong generality to various pairs of languages, even when the languages are from different families and are typologically divergent.",
        "As far as we know, only a few works focused on this topic (Xia and Lewis 2007; Ta?ckstro?m et al., 2013).",
        "We adopted the projection method based on word alignments since it is less affected by language differences.",
        "However, such methods also have some disadvantages.",
        "Firstly, the models trained on projected data could only cover words and cases appeared in the target side of parallel corpus, making it difficult to generalize to test data in broader domains.",
        "Secondly, the performances of these methods are limited by the accuracy of word alignments, especially when words between two languages are not one-one aligned.",
        "So the obtained labeled data contains a lot of noises, making the models built on them less accurate.",
        "This paper aims to build an accurate projection method with strong generality to various pairs of languages.",
        "We built the method on top of projection method based on word alignments because of its advantage of being less affected by syntactic differences, and proposed two solutions to solve the above two difficulties of this type of methods.",
        "Firstly, we introduce Brown clusters of target language to make the projection models cover broader cases.",
        "Brown clustering is a kind of word representations, which assigns word with similar functions to the same cluster.",
        "They can be efficiently learned on large-scale unlabeled data in target language, which is much easier to acquire even when the scales of parallel corpora of minor languages are limited.",
        "Brown clusters have been first introduced to the field of cross-lingual projections in (Ta?ckstro?m et al., 2012) and have achieved great improvements on projection between European languages.",
        "However, their work was based on the direct projection methods so that it do not work very well between languages from different families as will be shown in Section 3.",
        "Secondly, to reduce the noises in projection, we propose a noise removing method to detect and correct noisy projected labels.",
        "The method was also built on Brown clusters, based on the assumption that instances with similar representations of Brown clusters tend to have similar labels.",
        "As far as we know, no one has done any research on removing noises based on the space of word representations in the field of NLP.",
        "Using above techniques, we achieved a projection method that adapts well on different language pairs even when the two languages differ enormously.",
        "Experiments of NER and POS tagging projection from English to Chinese proved the effectiveness of our methods.",
        "In the rest of our paper, Section 2 describes the proposed cross-lingual projection method.",
        "Evaluations are in Section 3.",
        "Section 4 gives concluding remarks."

        "Here English is the resource-rich language and Chinese is the target language.",
        "First, sentences from the source side of the parallel corpus are labeled by an accurate model in English (e.g., ?Rongji Zhu?",
        "and ?Gan Luo?",
        "were labeled as ?PER?",
        "), since the source language has rich resources to build accurate NER models.",

        "Same or similar word representations will be assigned to words appearing in similar contexts, such as person names.",
        "Since word representations are trained on large-scale unlabeled sentences in target language, they cover much more words than the parallel corpus does.",
