        "The linear model for machine translation (Och and Ney, 2002) has become the de-facto standard in the field.",
        "Recently, researchers have proposed a large number of additional features (TaroWatan-abe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2009) and parameter tuning methods (Chiang et al., 2008b; Hopkins and May, 2011; Cherry and Foster, 2012) which are better able to scale to the larger parameter space.",
        "However, a significant feature engineering effort is still required from practitioners.",
        "When a linear model does not fit well, researchers are careful to manually add important feature conjunctions, as for example, (Daume?",
        "III and Jagarlamudi, 2011; Clark et al., 2012).",
        "In the related field of web search ranking, automatically learned non-linear features have brought dramatic improvements in quality (Burges et al., 2005; Wu ?This research was conducted during the author's intern-ship at Microsoft Research et al., 2010).",
        "Here we adapt the main insights of such work to the machine translation setting and share results on two language pairs.",
        "Some recent works have attempted to relax the linearity assumption on MT features (Nguyen et al., 2007), by defining non-parametric models on complete translation hypotheses, for use in an n-best re-ranking setting.",
        "In this paper we develop a framework for inducing non-linear features in the form of regression decision trees, which decompose locally and can be integrated efficiently in decoding.",
        "The regression trees encode non-linear feature combinations of the original features.",
        "We build on the work by Friedman (2000) which shows how to induce features to minimize any differentiable loss function.",
        "In our application the features are regression decision trees, and the loss function is the pairwise ranking log-loss from the PRO method for parameter tuning (Hopkins and May, 2011).",
        "Additionally, we show how to design the learning process such that the induced features are local on phrase-pairs and their language model and reordering context, and thus can be incorporated in decoding efficiently.",
        "Our results using re-ranking on two language pairs show that the feature induction approach can bring small gains in performance.",
        "Overall, even though the method shows some promise, we do not see the dramatic gains that have been seen for the web search ranking task (Wu et al., 2010).",
        "Further improvements in the original feature set and the induction algorithm, as well as full integration in decoding are needed to potentially result in substantial performance improvements."
