        "One of the best performing techniques, phrase pivoting (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007), builds an induced new phrase table between the source and target.",
        "One of the main issues of this technique is that the size of the newly created pivot phrase table is very large (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007).",
        "Moreover, many of the produced phrase pairs are of low quality which affects the translation choices during decoding and the overall translation quality.",
        "In this paper, we introduce language independent features to determine the quality of the pivot phrase pairs between source and target.",
        "We show positive results (0.6 BLEU points) on Persian-Arabic SMT.",
        "Next, we briefly discuss some related work.",
        "We then review two common pivoting strategies and how we use them in Section 3.",

        "Many researchers have investigated the use of pivoting (or bridging) approaches to solve the data scarcity issue (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Wu and Wang, 2009; Khalilov et al., 2008; Bertoldi et al., 2008; Habash and Hu, 2009).",
        "The main idea is to introduce a pivot language, for which there exist large source-pivot and pivot-target bilingual corpora.",
        "Pivoting has been explored for closely related languages (Hajic?",
        "et al, 2000) as well as unrelated languages (Koehn et al., 2009; Habash and Hu, 2009).",
        "Many different pivot strategies have been presented in the literature.",
        "The following three are perhaps the most common.",
        "The first strategy is the sentence translation technique in which we first translate the source sentence to the pivot language, and then translate the pivot language sentence to the target language",
        "(Khalilov et al., 2008).",
        "The second strategy is based on phrase pivoting (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Wu and Wang, 2009).",
        "In phrase pivoting, a new source-target phrase table (translation model) is induced from source-pivot and pivot-target phrase tables.",
        "Lexical weights and translation probabilities are computed from the two translation models.",
        "The third strategy is to create a synthetic source-target corpus by translating the pivot side of source-pivot corpus to the target language using an existing pivot-target model (Bertoldi et al., 2008).",
        "In this paper, we build on the phrase pivoting approach, which has been shown to be the best with comparable settings (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007).",
        "We extend phrase table scores with two other features that are language independent.",
        "Since both Persian and Arabic are morphologically rich, we should mention that there has been a lot of work on translation to and from morphologically rich languages (Yeniterzi and Oflazer, 2010; Elming and Habash, 2009; El Kholy and Habash, 2010a; Habash and Sadat, 2006; Kathol and Zheng, 2008).",
        "Most of these efforts are focused on syntactic and morphological processing to improve the quality of translation.",
        "To our knowledge, there hasn't been a lot of work on Persian and Arabic as a language pair.",
