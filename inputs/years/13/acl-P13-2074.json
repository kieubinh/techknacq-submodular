        "Statistical machine translation (SMT) has made considerable advances in using syntactic properties of languages in both the training and the decoding of translation systems.",
        "Over the past few years, many researchers have started to realize that incorporating semantic features of languages can also be effective in increasing the quality of translations, as they can model relationships that often are not derivable from syntactic structures.",
        "Wu and Fung (2009) demonstrated the promise of using features based on semantic predicate-argument structure in machine translation, using these feature to re-rank machine translation output.",
        "In general, re-ranking approaches are limited by the set of translation hypotheses, leading to a desire to incorporate semantic features into the translation model used during MT decoding.",
        "Liu and Gildea (2010) introduced two types of semantic features for tree-to-string machine translation.",
        "These features model the reorderings and deletions of the semantic roles in the source sentence during decoding.",
        "They showed that addition of these semantic features helps improve the quality of translations.",
        "Since tree-to-string systems are trained on parse trees, they are constrained by the tree structures and are generally outperformed by string-to-tree systems.",
        "Xiong et al. (2012) integrated two discriminative feature-based models into a phrase-based SMT system, which used the semantic predicate-argument structure of the source language.",
        "Their first model defined features based on the context of a verbal predicate, to predict the target translation for that verb.",
        "Their second model predicted the reordering direction between a predicate and its arguments from the source to the target sentence.",
        "Wu et al. (2010) use a head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG) parser to add semantic representations to their translation rules.",
        "In this paper, we use semantic role labels to enrich a string-to-tree translation system, and show that this approach can increase the BLEU (Pap-ineni et al., 2002) score of the translations.",
        "We extract GHKM-style (Galley et al., 2004) translation rules from training data where the target side has been parsed and labeled with semantic roles.",
        "Our general method of adding information to the syntactic tree is similar to the ?tree grafting?",
        "approach of Baker et al. (2010), although we focus on predicate-argument structure, rather than named entity tags and modality.",
        "We modify the rule extraction procedure of Galley et al. (2004) to produce rules representing the overall predicate-argument structure of each verb, allowing us to model alternations in the mapping from syntax to semantics of the type described by Levin (1993)."
