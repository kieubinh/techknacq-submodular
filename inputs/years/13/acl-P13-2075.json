        "Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) techniques have been successfully applied to a wide range of natural language processing tasks, such as statistical machine translation (Kumar and Byrne, 2004), automatic speech recognition (Goel and Byrne, 2000), parsing (Titov and Henderson, 2006), etc.",
        "This work makes further exploration along this line of research, by applying MBR technique to question answering (QA).",
        "The function of a typical factoid question answering system is to automatically give answers to questions in most case asking about entities, which usually consists of three key components: question understanding, passage retrieval, and answer extraction.",
        "In this paper, we propose two MBR-based Answer Re-ranking (MBRAR) approaches, aiming to re-rank answer candidates from either single and multiple QA systems.",
        "The first one re-ranks answer outputs from single QA system based on a traditional MBR model by measuring the correlations between each answer candidates and all the other candidates; while the second one re-ranks the combined answer outputs from multiple QA systems based on a mixture model-based MBR model.",
        "The key contribution of this work is that, our MBRAR approaches assume little about QA systems and can be easily applied to QA systems with arbitrary sub-components.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a brief review of the QA task and describe two types of QA systems with different pros and cons.",
        "Section 3 presents twoMBRAR approaches that can re-rank the answer candidates from single and multiple QA systems respectively.",
        "The relationship between our approach and previous work is discussed in Section 4.",
        "Section 5 evaluates our methods on large scale questions selected from two domains (Jeopardy!",
        "and Web) and shows promising results.",
        "Section 6 concludes this paper."

        "On the other hand, TI-QA can provide higher answer coverage, as it can extract answer candidates with multiple answer types.",
        "However, more answer candidates with different types bring more difficulties to the answer ranking model to rank the correct answer to the top 1 position.",
