        "Community-based (or collaborative) question answering(CQA) such as Yahoo!",
        "Answers1 and Baidu Zhidao2 has become a popular online service in recent years.",
        "Unlike traditional question answering (QA), information seekers can post their questions on a CQA website which are later answered by other users.",
        "However, with the increase of the CQA archive, there accumulate massive duplicate questions on CQA websites.",
        "One of the primary reasons is that information seekers cannot retrieve answers they need and thus post another new question consequently.",
        "Therefore, it becomes more and more important to find semantically similar questions.",
        "The major challenge for CQA retrieval is the lexical gap (or lexical chasm) among the questions (Jeon et al., 2005b; Xue et al., 2008),",
        "as shown in Table 1.",
        "Since question-answer pairs are usually short, the word mismatching problem is especially important.",
        "However, due to the lexical gap between questions and answers as well as spam typically existing in user-generated content, filtering and ranking answers is very challenging.",
        "The earlier studies mainly focus on generating redundant features, or finding textual clues using machine learning techniques; none of them ever consider questions and their answers as relational data but instead model them as independent information.",
        "Moreover, they only consider the answers of the current question, and ignore any previous knowledge that would be helpful to bridge the lexical and semantic gap.",
        "In recent years, many methods have been proposed to solve the word mismatching problem between user questions and the questions in a QA archive(Blooma and Kurian, 2011), among which the translation-based (Riezler et al., 2007; Xue et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2011) or syntactic-based approaches (Wang et al., 2009) methods have been proven to improve the performance of CQA retrieval.",
        "However, most of these approaches used",
        "pipeline methods: (1) modeling word association; (2) question retrieval combined with other models, such as vector space model (VSM), Okapi model (Robertson et al., 1994) or language model (LM).",
        "The pipeline methods often have many non-trivial experimental setting and result to be very hard to reproduce.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel unified retrieval model for CQA, latent semantic tensor indexing (LSTI), which is an extension of the conventional latent semantic indexing (LSI) (Deerwester et al., 1990).",
        "Similar to LSI, LSTI can integrate the two detached parts (modeling word association and question retrieval) into a single model.",
        "In traditional document retrieval, LSI is an effective method to overcome two of the most severe constraints on Boolean keyword queries: synonymy, that is, multiple words with similar meanings, and polysemy, or words with more than one meanings.",
        "Usually in a CQA archive, each entry (or question) is in the following triple form:?question title, question content, answer?.",
        "Because the performance based solely on the content or the answer part is less than satisfactory, many works proposed that additional relevant information should be provided to help question retrieval(Xue et al., 2008).",
        "For example, if a question title contains the keyword ?why?, the CQA triple, which contains ?because?",
        "or ?reason?",
        "in its answer part, is more likely to be what the user looks for.",
        "Since each triple in CQA has three parts, the natural representation of the CQA collection is a three-dimensional array, or 3rd-order tensor, rather than a matrix.",
        "Based on the tensor decomposition, we can model the word association simultaneously in the pairs: question-question, question-body and question-answer.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 3 introduces the concept of LSI.",
        "Section 4 presents our method.",
        "Section 5 describes the experimental analysis.",
        "Section 6 concludes the paper."

(2005a; 2005b) compared four different retrieval methods, i.e., the vector space model(Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2005), the Okapi BM25 model (Robertson et al., 1994), the language model, and the translation model, for question retrieval on CQA data, and the experimental results showed that the translation model outperforms the others.",
        "However, they focused only on similarity measures between queries (questions) and question titles.",
        "In subsequent work (Xue et al., 2008), a translation-based language model combining the translation model and the language model for question retrieval was proposed.",
