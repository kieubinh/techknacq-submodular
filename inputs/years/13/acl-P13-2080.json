      "text": [
        "Approaches for applied semantic inference over texts gained growing attention in recent years, largely triggered by the textual entailment framework (Dagan et al., 2009).",
        "Textual entailment is a generic paradigm for semantic inference, where the objective is to recognize whether a textual hypothesis (labeled H) can be inferred from another given text (labeled T ).",
        "The definition of textual entailment is in some sense strict, in that it requires that H's meaning be implied by T in its entirety.",
        "This means that from an entailment perspective, a text that contains the main ideas of a hypothesis, but lacks a minor detail, is indiscernible from an entirely unrelated text.",
        "For example, if T is ?muscles move bones?, and H ?the main job of muscles is to move bones?, then T does not entail H , and we are left with no sense of how close (T,H) were to entailment.",
        "In the related problem of semantic text similarity, gradual measures are already in use.",
        "The semantic text similarity challenge in SemEval 2012 (Agirre et al., 2012) explicitly defined different levels of similarity from 5 (semantic equivalence) to 0 (no relation).",
        "For instance, 4 was defined as ?the two sentences are mostly equivalent, but some unimportant details differ?, and 3 meant that ?the two sentences are roughly equivalent, but some important information differs?.",
        "Though this modeling does indeed provide finer-grained notions of similarity, it is not appropriate for semantic inference for two reasons.",
        "First, the term ?important information?",
        "is vague; what makes one detail more important than another?",
        "Secondly, similarity is not sufficiently well-defined for sound semantic inference; for example, ?snowdrops bloom in summer?",
        "and ?snowdrops bloom in winter?",
        "may be similar, but have contradictory meanings.",
        "All in all, these measures of similarity do not quite capture the gradual relation needed for semantic inference.",
        "An appealing approach to dealing with the rigidity of textual entailment, while preserving the more precise nature of the entailment definition, is by breaking down the hypothesis into components, and attempting to recognize whether each one is individually entailed by T .",
        "It is called partial textual entailment, because we are only interested in recognizing whether a single element of the hypothesis is entailed.",
        "To differentiate the two tasks, we will refer to the original textual entailment task as complete textual entailment.",
        "Partial textual entailment was first introduced by Nielsen et al. (2009), who presented a machine learning approach and showed significant improvement over baseline methods.",
        "Recently, a public benchmark has become available through the Joint Student Response Analysis and 8th Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) Challenge in SemEval 2013 (Dzikovska et al., 2013), on which we focus in this paper.",
        "Our goal in this paper is to investigate the idea of partial textual entailment, and assess whether",
        "existing complete textual entailment methods can be used to recognize it.",
        "We assume the facet model presented in SemEval 2013, and adapt existing technologies to the task of recognizing partial entailment (Section 3).",
        "Our work further expands upon (Nielsen et al., 2009) by evaluating these adapted methods on the new RTE-8 benchmark (Section 4).",
        "Partial entailment may also facilitate an alternative divide and conquer approach to complete textual entailment.",
        "We provide an initial investigation of this approach (Section 5)."

        "We assume the simplified model that was used in RTE-8, where the relation between the words is not explicitly stated.",
        "Instead, it remains unstated, but its interpreted meaning should correspond to the manner in which the words are related in the hypothesis.",
        "For example, in the sentence ?the main job of muscles is to move bones?, the pair (muscles, move) represents a facet.",
        "While it is not explicitly stated, reading the original sentence indicates that muscles is the agent of move.",

        "Both w1 and w2 must match for this module's entailment decision to be positive.",

        "BIUTEE has shown state-of-the-art performance on previous recognizing textual entailment challenges (Stern and Dagan, 2012).",
