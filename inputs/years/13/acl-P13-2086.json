        "Furthermore, some scientists believe that QM is the final principle of physics even the whole natural science.",
        "Thus, more and more researchers have expanded the study of QM in other fields of science, and it has affected almost every aspect of natural science and technology deeply, such as quantum computation.",
        "The principle of quantum computation has also affected a lot of scientific researches in computer science, specifically in computational mod-eling, cryptography theory as well as information theory.",
        "Some researchers have employed the principle and technology of quantum computation to improve the studies on Machine Learning (ML) (A?meur et al., 2006; A?meur et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2008; Gambs, 2008; Horn and Gottlieb, 2001; Nasios and Bors, 2007), a field which studies theories and constructions of systems that can learn from data, among which classification is a typical task.",
        "Thus, we attempted to build a computational model based on quantum computation theory to handle classification tasks in order to prove the feasibility of applying the QM model to machine learning.",
        "In this article, we present a method that considers the classifier as a physical system amenable to QM and treat the entire process of classification as the evolutionary process of a closed quantum system.",
        "According to QM, the evolution of quantum system can be described by a unitary operator.",
        "Therefore, the primary problem of building a quantum classifier (QC) is to find the correct or optimal unitary operator.",
        "We applied classical optimization algorithms to deal with the problem, and the experimental results have confirmed our theory.",
