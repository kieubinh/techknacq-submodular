        "Emotion classification aims to predict the emotion categories (e.g., happy, angry, or sad) of a given text (Quan and Ren, 2009; Das and Ban-dyopadhyay, 2009).",
        "With the rapid growth of computer mediated communication applications, such as social websites and miro-blogs, the research on emotion classification has been attracting more and more attentions recently from the natural language processing (NLP) community (Chen et al., 2010; Purver and Battersby, 2012).",
        "In general, a single text may possess two kinds of emotions, writer's emotion and reader's emotion, where the former concerns the emotion expressed by the writer when writing the text and the latter concerns the emotion expressed by a reader after reading the text.",
        "For example, consider two short texts drawn from a news and corresponding comments, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "On * * Corresponding author one hand, for the news text, while its writer just objectively reports the news and thus does not express his emotion in the text, a reader could yield sad or worried emotion.",
        "On the other hand, for the comment text, its writer clearly expresses his sad emotion while the emotion of a reader after reading the comments is not clear (Some may feel sorry but others might feel careless).",

        "Comment Writer's emotion: sad Comment Reader's emotion: Unknown",
        "emotions on a news and its comments Accordingly, emotion classification can be grouped into two categories: reader's emotion and writer's emotion classifications.",
        "Although both emotion classification tasks have been widely studied in recent years, they are always considered independently and treated separately.",
        "However, news and their corresponding comments often appear simultaneously.",
        "For example, in many news websites, it is popular to see a news followed by many comments.",
        "In this case, because the writers of the comments are a part of the readers of the news, the writer's emotions on the comments are exactly certain reflection of the reader's emotions on the news.",
        "That is, the comment writer's emotions and the news reader's emotions are strongly related.",
        "For example,",
        "in Figure 1, the comment writer's emotion ?sad?",
        "is among the news reader's emotions.",
        "Above observation motivates joint modeling of news reader's and comment writer's emotions.",
        "In this study, we systematically investigate the relationship between the news reader's emotions and the comment writer's emotions.",
        "Specifically, we manually analyze their agreement in a corpus collected from a news website.",
        "It is interesting to find that such agreement only applies to coarse-grained emotion categories (i.e., positive and negative) with a high probability and does not apply to fine-grained emotion categories (e.g., happy, angry, and sad).",
        "This motivates our joint modeling in terms of the coarse-grained emotion categories.",
        "Specifically, we consider the news text and the comment text as two different views of expressing either the news reader's or comment writer's emotions.",
        "Given the two views, a co-training algorithm is proposed to perform semi-supervised emotion classification so that the information in the unlabeled data can be exploited to improve the classification performance."

        "tion Comment writer's emotion classification has been a hot research topic in NLP during the last decade (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002; Alm et al., 2005; Wilson et al., 2009) and previous studies can be mainly grouped into two categories: coarse-grained and fine-grained emotion classification.",
        "Coarse-grained emotion classification, also called sentiment classification, concerns only two emotion categories, such as like or dislike and positive or negative (Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu, 2012).",
        "This kind of emotion classification has attracted much attention since the pioneer work by Pang et al. (2002) in the NLP community due to its wide applications (Cui et al., 2006; Riloff et al., 2006; Dasgupta and Ng, 2009; Li et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011).",
        "In comparison, fine-grained emotion classification aims to classify a text into multiple emotion categories, such as happy, angry, and sad.",
        "One main group of related studies on this task is about emotion resource construction, such as emotion lexicon building (Xu et al., 2010; Volkova et al., 2012) and sentence-level or document-level corpus construction (Quan and Ren, 2009; Das and Bandyopadhyay, 2009).",
        "Besides, all the related studies focus on supervised learning (Alm et al., 2005; Aman and Szpakowicz, 2008; Chen et al., 2010; Purver and Battersby, 2012; Moshfeghi et al., 2011), and so far, we have not seen any studies on semi-supervised learning on fine-grained emotion classification."

        "We only select the news articles with a dominant emotion (possessing more than 50% votes) in our data.",
        "Besides, as we attempt to consider the comment writer's emotions, the news articles without any comments are filtered.",
        "As a result, we obtain a corpus of 3495 news articles together with their comments and the numbers of the articles of happy, sad, angry, boring, heartwarming, and worried are 1405, 230, 1673, 75, 92 and 20 respectively.",

        "Besides the tags of the reader's emotions, each news article is followed by some comments, which can be seen as a reflection of the writer's emotions (Averagely, each news is followed by 15 comments).",
        "In order to know the exact relationship between these two kinds of emotions, we select 20 news from each category and ask two human annotators, named A and B, to manually annotate the writer's emotion (single-label) according to the comments of each news.",

        "Agreement between news reader's and comment writer's emotions: We compare the news reader's emotion (automatically extracted from the web page) and the comment writer's emotion (manually annotated by annotator A).",
        "The annotation agreement between the two kinds of emotions is 0.504 on the fine-grained emotion categories and 0.756 on the coarse-grained emotion categories.",
        "From the results, we can see that the agreement on the fine-grained emotions is a bit low while the agreement between the coarse-grained emotions, i.e., positive and negative, is very high.",
        "We find that although some fine-grained emotions of the comments are not consistent with the dominant emotion of the news, they belong to the same coarse-grained category.",
        "In a word, the agreement between news reader's and comment writer's emotions on the coarse-grained emotions is very high, even higher than the agreement between the two annotators (0.754 vs. 0.742).",
