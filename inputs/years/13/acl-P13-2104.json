        "However, the performance of such parsers declines when training and test data come from different domains.",
        "Furthermore, the manually annotated treebanks that these parsers rely on are highly expensive to create.",
        "Therefore, developing dependency parsing algorithms that can be easily ported from one domain to another?say, from a resource-rich domain to a resource-poor domain?is of great importance.",
        "Several approaches have been proposed for the task of parser adaptation.",

        "Plank and van No-ord (2011) proposed a data selection method based on effective measures of domain similarity for dependency parsing.",
        "There are roughly two varieties of domain adaptation problem?fully supervised case in which there are a small amount of labeled data in the target domain, and semi-supervised case in which there are no labeled data in the target domain.",
        "In this paper, we present a parsing adaptation approach focused on the fully supervised case.",
        "It is a feature augmentation approach in which the new features are constructed based on subtree information extracted from the auto-parsed target domain data.",

        "In the supervised setting for domain adaptation, there is a large amount of labeled data in the source domain and a small amount of labeled data in the target domain.",

        "These thresholds are chosen empirically on some development data set.",
        "The idea of distinguishing the source and target data is similar to the method in (Daumé III, 2007), which did feature augmentation by defining the following mappings:2",
        "Daumé III showed that differentiating features from the source and target domains improved performance for multiple NLP tasks.",
        "The difference between that study and our approach is that our new features are based on subtree information instead of copies of original features.",
        "Since the new features are based on the subtree information extracted from the auto-parsed target data, they represent certain properties of the target domain and that explains why adding them to the target data works better than adding them to both the source and target data."
