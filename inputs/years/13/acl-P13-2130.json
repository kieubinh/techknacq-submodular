        "Annotating frame information is a complex task, usually modeled in two steps: first annotators are asked to choose the situation (or frame) evoked by a given predicate (the lexical unit, LU) in a sentence, and then they assign the semantic roles (or frame elements, FEs) that describe the participants typically involved in the chosen frame.",
        "Existing frame annotation tools, such as Salto (Burchardt et al., 2006) and the Berkeley system (Fillmore et al., 2002) foresee this two-step approach, in which annotators first select a frame from a large repository of possible frames (1,162 frames are currently listed in the online version of the resource), and then assign the FE labels constrained by the chosen frame to LU dependents.",
        "In this paper, we argue that such workflow shows some redundancy which can be addressed by radically changing the annotation methodology and performing it in one single step.",
        "Our novel annotation approach is also more compliant with the definition of frames proposed in Fillmore (1976): in his seminal work, Fillmore postulated that the meanings of words can be understood on the basis of a semantic frame, i.e. a description of a type of event or entity and the participants in it.",
        "This implies that frames can be distinguished one from another on the basis of the participants involved, thus it seems more cognitively plausible to start from the FE annotation to identify the frame expressed in a sentence, and not the contrary.",
        "The goal of our methodology is to provide full frame annotation in a single step and in a bottom-up fashion.",
        "Instead of choosing the frame first, we focus on FEs and let the frame emerge based on the chosen FEs.",
        "We believe this approach complies better with the cognitive activity performed by annotators, while the 2-step methodology is more artificial and introduces some redundancy because part of the annotators?",
        "choices are replicated in the two steps (i.e. in order to assign a frame, annotators implicitly identify the participants also in the first step, even if they are annotated later).",
        "Another issue we investigate in this work is how semantic roles should be annotated in a crowdsourcing framework.",
        "This task is particularly complex, therefore it is usually performed by expert annotators under the supervision of linguistic experts and lexicographers, as in the case of FrameNet.",
        "In NLP, different annotation efforts for encoding semantic roles have been carried out, each applying its own methodology and annotation guidelines (see for instance Ruppenhofer et al.",
        "(2006) for FrameNet and Palmer et al. (2005) for PropBank).",
        "In this work, we present a pilot study in which we assess to what extent role descriptions meant for ?linguistics experts?",
        "are also suitable for annotators from the crowd.",
        "Moreover, we show how a simplified version of these descriptions, less bounded to a specific linguistic theory, improve the annotation quality."
