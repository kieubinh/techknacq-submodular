        "This paper addresses the importance of resource quality through the lens of a challenging NLP task: detecting selectional preference violations.",
        "We present DAVID, a simple, lexical resource-based preference violation detector.",
        "With as-is lexical resources, DAVID achieves an F1-measure of just 28.27%.",
        "When the resource entries and parser outputs for a small sample are corrected, however, the F1-measure on that sample jumps from 40% to 61.54%, and performance on other examples rises, suggesting that the algorithm becomes practical given refined resources.",
        "More broadly, this paper shows that resource quality matters tremendously, sometimes even more than algorithmic improvements."

        "A variety of NLP tasks have been addressed using selectional preferences or restrictions, including word sense disambiguation (see Navigli (2009)), semantic parsing (e.g., Shi and Mihalcea (2005)), and metaphor processing (see Shutova (2010)).",
        "These semantic problems are quite challenging; metaphor analysis, for instance, has long been recognized as requiring considerable semantic knowledge (Wilks, 1978; Carbonell, 1980).",
        "The advent of extensive lexical resources, annotated corpora, and a spectrum of NLP tools presents an opportunity to revisit such challenges from the perspective of selectional preference violations.",
        "Detecting these violations, however, constitutes a severe stress-test for resources designed for other tasks.",
        "As such, it can highlight shortcomings and allow quantifying the potential benefits of improving resources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and VerbNet (Schuler, 2005).",
        "In this paper, we present DAVID (Detector of Arguments of Verbs with Incompatible Denotations), a resource-based system for detecting preference violations.",
        "DAVID is one component of METAL (Metaphor Extraction via Targeted Analysis of Language), a new system for identifying, interpreting, and cataloguing metaphors.",
        "One purpose of DAVID was to explore how far lexical resource-based techniques can take us.",
        "Though our initial results suggested that the answer is ?not very,?",
        "further analysis revealed that the problem lies less in the technique than in the state of existing resources and tools.",
        "Often, it is assumed that the frontier of performance on NLP tasks is shaped entirely by algorithms.",
        "Manning (2011) showed that this may not hold for POS tagging ?",
        "that further improvements may require resource cleanup.",
        "In the same spirit, we argue that for some semantic tasks, exemplified by preference violation detection, resource quality may be at least as essential as algorithmic enhancements."

        "Flagging such semantic mismatches between verbs and arguments is the task of preference violation detection.",

        "Similarly, we define selectional preferences as the semantic constraints imposed by a verb's most basic sense.",
        "Dictionaries may list figurative senses of prune, but we take the basic sense to be cutting plant growth.",

        "Interestingly, resource corrections alone generally made a larger difference than tool corrections alone, suggesting that resources may be the dominant factor in resource-intensive tasks such as this one.",
        "Even more compellingly, the improvement from correcting both the tools and the resources was nearly double the sum of the improvements from each alone: tool and resource improvements interact synergistically.",
        "The effects on the test corpus are harder to interpret.",

        "Extrapolating from our experience, we estimate that it would take roughly 6-8 person-weeks to systematically fix this particular set of issues with VerbNet.",
