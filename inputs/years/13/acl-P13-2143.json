        "With more powerful computational analysis tools, researchers are now devoting efforts to establish a 'science of better science'",
        "by analyzing the ecosystem of scientific discovery (Goth, 2012).",
        "Amongst this ambition, school of thought analysis has been identified an important fine-grained scientific knowledge discovery task.",
        "As mentioned by Teufel (2010), it is important for an experienced scientist to know which papers belong to which school of thought (or technical route) through years of knowledge accumulation.",
        "Schools of thought typically emerge with the evolution of a research domain or scientific topic.",
        "Take reachability indexing for example, which we will repeatedly turn to later, there are two schools of thought, the cover-based (since about 1990) and hop-based (since the beginning of the 2000s) methods.",
        "Most of the following works belong to either school of thought and thus two streams of innovative ideas emerge.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates this situation.",
        "Two chains of subsequentially published papers represent two schools of thought of the reachability indexing domain.",
        "The top chain of white double-line circles and the bottom chain of shaded circles represent the cover-based and hop-based streams respectively.",
        "However it is not easy to gain this knowledge about school of thought.",
        "Current citation indexing services are not very helpful for this kind of knowledge discovery tasks.",
        "As explained in Figure 1, papers of different schools of thought cite each other heavily and form a rather dense citation graph.",
        "An extreme example is p14, which cites more hop-based papers than its own school of thought.",
        "If the current citation indexing service can be equipped with school of thought knowledge, it will help scientists, especially novice researchers, a lot in grasping the core ideas of a scientific domain quickly and making their own way of innovation (Upham et al., 2010).",
        "School of thought analysis is also useful for knowledge",
        "flow discovery (Zhuge, 2006; Zhuge, 2012), knowledge mapping (Chen, 2004; Herrera et al., 2010) and scientific paradigm summarization (Joang and Kan, 2010; Qazvinian et al., 2013) etc.",
        "This paper makes the first attempts to unsupervised school of thought analysis.",
        "Three main aspects of school of thought analysis can be identified: determining the number of schools of thought, characterizing school-of-thought words and categorizing papers into one or several school(s) of thought (if applicable).",
        "This paper focuses on the second subproblem and leaves the other two as future work.",
        "Particularly, we purpose to investigate whether characteristic school-of-thought words exist and whether they can be automatically characterized.",
        "To answer these questions, we propose the probabilistic generative School-Of-Thought model (SOT for short) based on the following assumptions on the scientific authoring process.",
        "Assumption A1.",
        "The co-occurrence patterns are useful for revealing which words and sentences are school-of-thought words and which schools of thought they describe.",
        "Take reachability indexing for example, hop-based papers try to get the 'optimum labeling'",
        "by finding the 'densest intermediate hops'",
        "to encode reachability information captured by an intermediate data structure called 'transitive closure contour'.",
        "To accomplish this, they solve the 'densest subgraph problem'",
        "on specifically created 'bipartite'",
        "graphs centered at 'hops'",
        "by transforming the problem into an equivalent 'minimum set cover'",
        "framework.",
        "Thus, these boldfaced words often occur as hop-based school-of-thought words.",
        "In cover-based methods, however, one or several 'spanning tree(s)'",
        "are extracted and '",
        "(multiple) intervals'",
        "are assigned to each node as reachability labels by 'pre-(order)'",
        "and 'post-order traversals'.",
        "Meanwhile, graph theory terminologies like 'root', 'child'",
        "and 'ancestor'",
        "etc.",
        "also frequently occur as cover-based school-of-thought words.",
        "Assumption A2.",
        "Before writing a sentence to deliver their ideas, the authors need to determine which school of thought this sentence is to portray.",
        "This is called the one-sot-per-sentence assumption, where 'sot'",
        "abbreviates 'school of thought'.",
        "The one-sot-per-sentence assumption does not mean that authors intentionally write this way, but only simulates the outcome of the scientific paper organization.",
        "Investigations into scientific writing reveal that sentences of different schools of thought can occur anywhere and are often interleaved.",
        "This is because authors of a scientific paper not only contribute to the school of thought they follow but also discuss different schools of thought.",
        "For example, in the Method part, the authors may turn to discuss another paper (possibly of a different school of thought) for comparison.",
        "This phenomenon also occurs frequently in the Results or Discussions section.",
        "Besides, citation sentences often acknowledge related works of different schools of thought.",
        "Assumption A3.",
        "All the papers of a domain talk about the general domain backgrounds.",
        "For example, reachability indexing aims to build 'compact indices'",
        "for facilitating 'reachability queries'",
        "between 'source'",

        "and 'successors'",
        "etc.",

        "Besides contributing original ideas, papers of the same school of thought typically need to follow some general strategies that make them fall into the same school of thought.",
        "For example, all the hop-based methods follow the general ideas of designing approximate algorithms for choosing good hops, while the original ideas of each paper lead to different labeling algorithms.",
        "Scientific readers pay attention to the original ideas of each paper as well as the general ideas of each school of thought.",
