        "The neuropsychological test of phonemic verbal fluency (PVF) consists of asking the patient to generate as many words as he or she can in a limited time (usually 60 seconds) that begin with a specific letter of the alphabet (Benton et al., 1989).",
        "This test has been used extensively as part of larger cognitive test batteries to study cognitive impairment resulting from a number of neurological conditions, including Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases, various forms of dementia, and traumatic brain injury (Troyer et al., 1998a,b; Raskin et al., 1992; Ho et al., 2002).",
        "Patients with these disorders tend to generate significantly fewer words on this test than do healthy individuals.",
        "Prior studies have also found that clustering (the degree to which patients generate groups of phonetically similar words) and switching (transitioning from one cluster to the next) behaviors are also sensitive to the effects of these neurological conditions.",
        "Contact sports such as boxing, mixed martial arts, football, and hockey are well known for high prevalence of repetitive head trauma.",
        "In recent years, the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma in athletes has become the subject of intensive research.",
        "In general, repetitive head trauma is a known risk factor for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a devastating and untreatable condition that ultimately results in permanent disability and premature death (Omalu et al., 2010; Gavett et al., 2011).",
        "However, little is currently known about the relationship between the amount of exposure to head injury and the magnitude of risk for developing these conditions.",
        "Furthermore, the development of new behavioral methods aimed at detection of subtle early signs of brain impairment is an active area of research.",
        "The PVF test is an excellent target for this research because it is very easy to administer and has been shown to be sensitive to the effects of acute traumatic brain injury (Raskin and Rearick, 1996).",
        "However, a major obstacle to using this test widely for early detection of brain impairment is that clustering and switching analyses needed to detect these subtle changes have to be done manually.",
        "These manual approaches are extremely labor-intensive, and are therefore limited in the types of clustering analyses that can be performed.",
        "Manual methods are also not scalable to large numbers of tests and are subject to inter-rater variability, making the results difficult to compare across subjects, as well as across different studies.",
        "Moreover, traditional manual clustering and switching analyses rely primarily on word orthography to determine phonetic similarity (e.g., by comparing the first two letters of two words), rather than phonetic representations, which would be prohibitively time",
        "consuming to obtain by hand.",
        "Phonetic similarity has been investigated in application to a number of research areas, including spelling correction (Toutanova and Moore, 2002), machine translation (Knight and Graehl, 1998; Kondrak et al., 2003), cross-lingual information retrieval (Melamed, 1999; Fujii and Ishikawa, 2001), language acquisition (Somers, 1998), historical linguistics (Raman et al., 1997), and social-media informatics (Liu et al., 2012); we propose a novel clinical application.",
        "Our objective was to develop and pilot-test a relatively simple, but robust, system for automatic identification of word clusters, based on phonetic content, that uses the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary, a decision tree-based algorithm for generating pronunciations for out-of-dictionary words, and two different approaches to calculating phonetic similarity between words.",
        "We first describe the system architecture and our phonetic-similarity computation methods, and then present the results of a pilot study, using data from professional fighters, demonstrating the utility of this system for early detection of subtle signs of brain impairment."

        "AH), and all multicharacter phone symbols were converted to arbitrary single-character symbols, in lowercase to distinguish these symbols from the original single-character ARPABET symbols (e.g., AH ?",

        "In addition to this method, we developed a less stringent approach in which we define chains instead of clusters.",
        "A chain comprises a sequence for which the phonetic representation of each word is similar to that of the word immediately prior to it in the chain (unless it is chain-initial) and the word subsequent to it (unless it is chain-final).",
        "Lone words that do not belong to any cluster constitute singleton clusters.",
        "We call chains based on the edit-distance method phonetic chains, and chains based on the common-biphone method common-biphone chains; both are illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "Unlike the binary CBS method, the PSS method produces continuous edit-distance values, and therefore requires a threshold for categorizing a word pair as similar or dissimilar.",
        "We determine the threshold empirically for each letter by taking a random sample of 1000 words starting with that letter in CMUdict, computing PSS scores for each pairwise combination (n = 499, 500), and then setting the threshold as the value separating the upper quintile of these scores.",

        "While manual phonetic clustering analysis yielded significant differences between the low-and high-exposure fighter groups, our automatic approach, which utilizes phonetic word representations, appears to be more sensitive to these differences; it also appears to produce less variability on clustering measures.",
        "Furthermore, as discussed above, automatic analysis is much less labor-intensive, and thus is more scalable to large numbers of tests.",
        "Moreover, our system is not prone to human error during analysis, nor to inter-rater variability.",
        "Of the two automatic clustering methods, the common-biphone method, which uses binary similarity values, found greater differences between groups in MPSS, MCL, and MXCL; thus, it appears to be more sensitive than the edit-distance method in detecting group differences.",
        "Common-biphone measures were also found to better correlate with manual measures; however, both automated methods disagreed with the manual approach to some extent.",
        "The fact that the automated common-biphone method shows significant differences between group means, while having less variability in measurements, suggests that it may be a more suitable measure of phonetic clustering than the traditional manual method.",
        "These results are particularly important in light of the difference in WCNT means between low-and high-exposure groups being small and not significant (WCNT: 17.6, SD 5.1 vs. 18.7, SD 4.7; p = 0.24).",
        "Other studies that used manual clustering and switching analyses reported significantly more switches for healthy controls than for individuals with neurological conditions (Troyer et al., 1997).",
        "These studies also reported differences in the total number of words produced, likely due to investigating already impaired individuals.",
        "Our findings show that the low-and high-exposure groups produced similar numbers of words, but the high-exposure group tended to produce longer sequences of phonetically similar words.",
        "The latter phenomenon may be interpreted as a mild form of perseverative (stuck-inset/repetitive) behavior that is characteristic of disorders involving damage to frontal and subcortical brain structures.",
        "To test this interpretation, we correlated MCL and MXCL, the two measures with greatest differences between low-and high-exposure fighters, with the count of repeated words (RCNT).",
        "The resulting correlations were 0.41 (p = 0.01) and 0.48 (p < 0.001), respectively, which supports the perseverative-behavior interpretation of our findings.",
        "Clearly, these findings are preliminary and need to be confirmed in larger samples; however, they plainly demonstrate the utility of our fully automated and quantifiable approach to characterizing and measuring clustering behavior on PVF tests.",
        "Pending further clinical validation, this system may be used for large-scale screening for subtle signs of certain types of brain damage or degeneration not only in contact-sports athletes, but also in the general population."
