        "The goal of text classification is to find the category or the topic of a text.",
        "Text categorization has popular applications in daily life such as email routing, spam detection, language identification, audience detection or genre detection and has major part in information retrieval tasks.",
        "The aim of this study is to explain the impact of morphological analysis and POS tagging on Turkish text classification task.",
        "We train various classifiers such as k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for this task.",
        "Turkish NLP tasks have been proven to benefit from morphological analysis or segmentation of some sort (Eryig?it et al., 2008; C?etinog?lu and Oflazer, 2006; C?ak?c?",
        "and Baldridge, 2006).",
        "Two different settings are used throughout the paper to represent different degrees of stemming and involvement of morphological information.",
        "The first one uses the first n-characters (prefixes) of each word in a bag of words approach.",
        "A variety of number of characters are compared from 4 to 7 to find the optimal length for data representation.",
        "This acts as the baseline for word segmentation in order to make the limited amount of data less sparse.",
        "The second setting involves word stems that are extracted with a morphological analysis followed by disambiguation.",
        "The effects of part of speech tagging are also explored.",
        "Disambiguated morphological data are used along with the part of speech tags as informative features about the word category.",
        "Extracting an n-character prefix is simple and considerably cheap compared to complex state-of-the-art morphological analysis and disambiguation process.",
        "There is a trade-off between quality and expense.",
        "Therefore, we may choose to use a cheap approximation instead of a more accurate representation if there is no significant sacrifice in the success of the system.",
        "Turkish is an agglutinative language that mostly uses suffixes1.",
        "Therefore, approximate stems that are extracted with fixed size stemming rarely contain any affixes.",
        "The training data used in this study consist of news articles taken from Milliyet Corpus that contains 80293 news articles published in the newspaper Milliyet (Hakkani-Tu?r et al., 2000) 2.",
        "The articles we use for training contain a subset of documents indexed from 1000-5000 and have at least 500 characters.",
        "The test set is not included in the original corpus, but it has also been downloaded form Milliyet's public website 3.",
        "The data used in this study have been ana-lyzed with the morphological analyser described in Oflazer (1993) and disambiguated with Sak et al.",

        "The annotated data is made available for pub-1It has only one prefix for intensifying adjectives and adverbs (s?ms?cak: very hot).",
        "It is just a modified version of the first syllable of the original word and also it is not common.",

        "It is simple, it ignores syntax, grammar and the relative positions of the words in the text (Harris, 1970).",
        "Each document is represented with an unordered list of words and each of the word frequencies in the collection becomes a feature representing the document.",
        "Bag-of-words approach is an intuitive way and popular among document classification tasks (Scott and Matwin, 1998; Joachims, 1997).",
        "Another way of representing documents with term weights is to use term frequency - inverse document frequency (Sparck Jones, 1988).",

        "TFIDF score of a term t in a document d in a collection D is calculated as below:",
        "tft,d is the number of times t occurs in d and idft,D is the number of documents in D over the number of document that contain t. The idea behind bag of words and TFIDF is to find a mapping from words to numbers which can also be described as finding a mathematical representation for text files.",
