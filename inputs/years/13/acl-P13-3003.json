        "Though there has been substantial research concerning the extraction of information from clinical notes, to date there has been less work concerning the extraction of useful information from patient-generated content.",
        "Using a dataset comprised of online support group discussion content, this paper investigates two dimensions that may be important in the extraction of patient-generated experiences from text; significant individuals/groups and medication use.",
        "With regard to the former, the paper describes an approach involving the pairing of important figures (e.g. family, hus-bands, doctors, etc.)",
        "and affect, and suggests possible applications of such techniques to research concerning online social support, as well as integration into search interfaces for patients.",
        "Additionally, the paper demonstrates the extraction of side effects and sentiment at different phases in patient medication use, e.g. adoption, current use, discontinuation and switching, and demonstrates the utility of such an application for drug safety monitoring in online discussion forums.",
        "1 Introduction Online support groups are a rich source of information concerning patient experiences, but they are far different from clinical content.",
        "Instead of ?The patient presents with??",
        "and ?denies vomit-ing,?",
        "patients may speak of their ?doc?",
        "and ?rheumy.?",
        "There may be utterances like ?LOL?",
        "(laugh out loud) and ?Hugs.?",
        "Patients may raise issues that they may be reticent to speak with health care practitioners about, day-to-day condition management issues, or personal strategies that they have for taking medicine.",
        "In recent years, it has been observed that patients may be a valuable source of expertise to other patients, and that they provide information that is different from the expertise of clinicians (Civan & Pratt, 2007; Hartzler & Pratt, 2011).",
        "This may include: action strategies, recommended knowledge, suggested approaches, and information resources for dealing with problems.",
        "This content can be extremely valuable to clinicians and patients alike; however, to date most interfaces for patient-generated content offer few features tailored to the unique nature of the content in these support forums.",
        "Thus, the objective of the current paper was to explore techniques for extracting and visualizing dimensions of patient experience.",
        "For this preliminary work, two specific dimensions were selected: interpersonal interactions and medication use.",
        "Interpersonal interactions are an important dimension to consider because others have such a profound impact on patient experience.",
        "For ex-ample, social support from family, friends and even practitioners can be invaluable to patients; and understanding, (or the lack of it), from practitioners and other people in one's life can be enormously difficult for people, especially those dealing with a stigmatized condition such as fi-bromyalgia (Barker, 2008).",
        "Thus, automatic identification of patient experiences with others, e.g. family, husband, wife, son, daughter, doctor, etc., and ways of highlighting similar types of experiences across patients, might serve various uses.",
        "Scientists could use this to study social support, physician-patient communication and other types of interpersonal interactions.",
        "Inte-grated into a search interface, patients could search for others with similar experiences, and see if there are strategies that they could use to address their own problem.",
        "Medication use is another important dimension of patient experience.",
        "There has also been an increased interest in the use of online discussion content to predict adverse events and monitor off-label prescription practices (e.g. Wang et al., 2011; Leaman et al., 2010; Chee et al., 2011).",
        "This work differs from previous literature in that the method identifies and visually contextualizes patient medication experiences, particularly in terms of stages of use and affect.",
        "bromyalgia.",
        "As can be seen, many posts do not include references to other people, but rather, focus on other areas such as patients?",
        "own expe-riences.",
        "Term Breast cancer Diabetes Fibromyal-gia Family 5.09 3.95 1.75 Husband 4.03 3.4 3.02 Wife 0.57 0.92 0.41 Mother 8.62 3.86 1.54 Son 1 3.86 0.61 Daughter 2.23 4.8 1 Friend 3.13 2.23 1.85 Doctor 13.28 13.49 16.42 People 8.42 13.37 8.96 Table 2: Percent of Posts Mentioning Important Roles Next, the degree of affect expressed in proximity with these roles was investigated.",
        "Various sentiment lexicons are available, e.g. Senti-WordNet, WordNet-Affect and the LIWC lexi-con.",
        "Many lexicons classify words as positive or negative or by a limited set of emotions; howev-er, with complex issues like health and interpersonal interactions, there may be multiple dimen-sions.",
        "WordNet-Affect was selected for its diverse set of emotion categories.",
        "Following a review of emotion research and preliminary content analysis of the corpus, seven emotions were selected on the basis of frequency and relevance to the conditions (Table 3).",
        "Emotion Example Anger I'm happy but also mad cuz I've been suffering and no doctor bothered to tell me about this.",
        "Fear I have the prescription right here and afraid to try it.",
        "Frustration It is extremely discouraging to hear that repeatedly...",
        "Sadness It's sad that I am so excited about getting some sleep.",
        "Anxiety You may be worrying over noth-ing.",
        "Happiness I'm so happy Lyrica is working for you.",
        "Hope I really hope this works for you.",
        "Table 3: Examples of Emotional Expression The percentage of posts expressing various affect types was calculated (Table 4).",
        "Across all conditions, fear and hope were most common.",
        "The highest proportion of fear, happiness and hope were seen in the breast cancer forum.",
        "Though anger and frustration were not as common as other emotions, higher levels of these emotions in diabetes are perhaps worthy of note.",
        "Emotion Breast cancer Diabetes Fibromyal-gia Hope 15.55 12.2 13.36 Anger 1.5 2.82 1.38 Frustration 0.78 3.49 1.75 Fear 16.05 11.11 6.32 Happiness 10.31 6.41 5.98 Sadness 10.26 9.91 8.21 Anxiety 9.85 8.29 4.81 Table 4: Percentage of Posts Expressing Emotions Radar graphs illustrating the extent of emotional expression for the various roles were generated to facilitate comparison (Fig.",
        "1).",
        "The light blue line, representing ?doctor,?",
        "is the innermost ring in all cases, demonstrating that emotional expression occurs least often in posts that mention doctors.",
        "Posts mentioning family (dark blue lines) were generally associated with higher degrees of emotional expression.",
        "Moreover, it is interesting that the patterns of emotional expression are quite different across conditions.",
        "This paper also explores the visualization of discussion content by combining important figures and their actions.",
        "For this preliminary work, this action was undertaken with the fibromyalgia forum.",
        "The approach taken here was to extract high frequency verbs co-occurring in the same sentence with the target role.",
        "High frequency verbs that co-occurred with ?doctor?",
        "included: ?said,?",
        "?told,?",
        "?gave,?",
        "?prescribed,?",
        "?started,?",
        "and ?diagnosed.?",
        "The verb ?asked?",
        "also occurred frequently because forum participants often discussed or suggested questions to ask of doctors.",
        "Arranging person-verb pairings together in an interface could be a convenient way to acquire a sense of what patients are being told, and what medications doctors are prescribing.",
        "One might even add additional search constraints.",
        "For example, with regard to patient experiences with doctors prescribing Lyrica, the system might retrieve: ?Recently my doctor put me on Lyrica which did help but had me?,?",
        "?My doctor gave me a ?taper down?",
        "schedule,?",
        "?My doctor prescribed Lyrica which I refused to take.?",
        "Patients could use such a system to acquire a sense of the range of experiences that others have had with the drug.",
        "tor about Elavil and Lyrica combination,?",
        "?She suggested staying on the Lyrica?.",
        "while?",
        "doing the Vitamin D treatment,?",
        "and ?Word of advice: stop taking SSRI 's at least one week prior to start of Savella.?",
        "Forum posts are valuable because they are rich troves of patient experience; however, their richness means that it is also possible to get lost in the story.",
        "An interface that organizes the advice, but also allows one to link to the full text, can help users to orient themselves.",
        "5 Discussion and Implications This study employed NLP techniques in order to model two dimensions of patient experience in online support forums: interpersonal interactions and medication use.",
        "With regard to interactions with others, the prominence of different individuals and associated affect differed depending on condition.",
        "With regard to medication use, patients?",
        "experiences of medication use differed along phase of adoption.",
        "These results may have important implications for the design of support forums.",
        "For example, in posts about family that contained fear and anxiety, certain topics tended to occur often: family history, families being supportive or non-supportive, and concerns of worrying the family.",
        "Forum participants presented various perspectives and suggestions concerning these issues.",
        "Thus, one recommendation is that systems could be designed to organize these various perspectives and suggestions in a form that is easier for the viewer to understand.",
        "The results of this study also yielded various insights concerning fibromyalgia.",
        "In particu-lar, the prominence of doctors, and relatively infrequent mention of family and friends was worthy of note.",
        "Previous research has found that fibromyalgia patients report a lack of understanding from medical practitioners and others around them (e.g. Madden & Sim, 2006; Sim & Madden, 2008).",
        "These reports of interactions with medical practitioners could help researchers to understand where gaps in knowledge and communication exist in both parties, and attempt to rectify them.",
        "The content from online support forums may also be helpful for researchers seeking to understand patients?",
        "patterns of interpersonal interaction.",
        "The framework presented here for modeling medication use could be useful in many set-tings.",
        "Visualizing side effects at various points in the adoption, use and perhaps discontinuation of a medication could avert potential mis-understandings.",
        "For example, sentiment analysis on a medication X might be favorable overall; however, decomposing the posts by phase might show that users initially react fa-vorably, but develop problems with it over time.",
        "Of course, the converse, that individuals experience certain side effects initially, but that these disappear over time, could also be true.",
        "Such information could be useful to a wide audience, including patients, clinicians, researchers and the pharmaceutical industry.",
        "5.1 Limitations and Future Directions There are many directions in which the current work could be improved.",
        "First, in the case of interpersonal interactions, affect was modeled as dichotomous variable indicating presence or absence.",
        "However, the level of emotional expression in a post could vary substantially.",
        "Thus, it may be useful to employ a lexicon that provides word rankings, such as SentiWordNet (Esuli & Sebastiani, 2006).",
        "In the case of medication use, extraction of relevant sentences was based on presence of the medication name; thus, the system would not have identified sentences in which pronouns were used.",
        "A system that performed co-reference resolution might identify significantly more references to medications.",
        "Because previous research has indicated that medications are a common topic in fibromyal-gia-related discussion, medication use was a natural target for modeling discussion content.",
        "However, it would also be useful to extend the modeling to include treatment experiences.",
        "Treatments such as massage and aqua therapy are often used in fibromyalgia, and treatments are the foci for many other conditions, such as breast cancer.",
        "Rather than considering phases of medication use, one might consider psychological state and expectations prior to, during and after treatment.",
        "Lastly, the interface that was developed for exploring medication use was specific to fibromyalgia; moving forward, it would be useful to expand the interface to other conditions.",
