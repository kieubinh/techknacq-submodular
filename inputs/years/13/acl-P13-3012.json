        "Coreference resolution is the task of determining which mentions in a text refer to the same entity.",
        "With the advent of machine learning and the availability of annotated corpora in the mid 1990s the research focus shifted from rule-based approaches to supervised machine learning techniques.",
        "Quite recently, however, rule-based approaches regained popularity due to Stanford's multi-pass sieve approach which exhibits state-of-the-art performance on many standard coreference data sets (Raghunathan et al., 2010) and also won the CoNLL-2011 shared task on coreference resolution (Lee et al., 2011; Pradhan et al., 2011).",
        "These results show that carefully crafted rule-based systems which employ suitable inference schemes can achieve competitive performance.",
        "Such a system can be considered unsupervised in the sense that it does not employ training data for optimizing parameters.",
        "In this paper we present a graph-based approach for coreference resolution that models a document to be processed as a graph.",
        "The nodes are mentions and the edges correspond to relations between mentions.",
        "Coreference resolution is performed via graph clustering.",
        "Our approach belongs to a class of recently proposed graph models for coreference resolution (Cai and Strube, 2010; Sapena et al., 2010; Martschat et al., 2012) and is designed to be a simplified version of existing approaches.",
        "In contrast to previous models belonging to this class we do not learn any edge weights but perform inference on the graph structure only which renders our model unsupervised.",
        "On the English data of the CoNLL?12 shared task the model outperforms most systems which participated in the shared task."
