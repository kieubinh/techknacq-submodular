        "Mental lexicon is the representation of the words in the human mind and their associations that help fast retrieval and comprehension (Aitchison, 1987).",
        "Words are known to be associated with each other in terms of, orthography, phonology, morphology and semantics.",
        "However, the precise nature of these relations is unknown.",
        "An important issue that has been a subject of study for a long time is to identify the fundamental units in terms of which the mental lexicon is organized.",
        "That is, whether lexical representations in the mental lexicon are word based or are they organized along morphological lines.",
        "For example, whether a word such as ?unimaginable?",
        "is stored in the mental lexicon as a whole word or do we break it up ?un-?",
        ", ?imagine?",
        "and ?- able?, understand the meaning of each of these constituent and then recombine the units to comprehend the whole word.",
        "Such questions are typically answered by designing appropriate priming experiments (Mars-len-Wilson et al., 1994) or other lexical decision tasks.",
        "The reaction time of the subjects for recognizing various lexical items under appropriate conditions reveals important facts about their organization in the brain.",
        "(See Sec. 2 for models of morphological organization and access and related experiments).",
        "A clear understanding of the structure and the processing mechanism of the mental lexicon will further our knowledge of how the human brain processes language.",
        "Further, these linguistically important and interesting questions are also highly significant for computational linguistics (CL) and natural language processing (NLP) applications.",
        "Their computational significance arises from the issue of their storage in lexical resources like WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and raises the questions like, how to store morphologically complex words, in a lexical resource like WordNet keeping in mind the storage and access efficiency.",
        "There is a rich literature on organization and lexical access of morphologically complex words where experiments have been conducted mainly for derivational suffixed words of English, Hebrew, Italian, French, Dutch, and few other languages (Marslen-Wilson et al., 2008; Frost et al., 1997; Grainger, et al., 1991; Drews and Zwitser-lood, 1995).",
        "However, we do not know of any such investigations for Indian languages, which",
        "are morphologically richer than many of their Indo-European cousins.",
        "Moreover, Indian languages show some distinct phenomena like, compound and composite verbs for which no such investigations have been conducted yet.",
        "On the other hand, experiments indicate that mental representation and processing of morphologically complex words are not quite language independent (Taft, 2004).",
        "Therefore, the findings from experiments in one language cannot be generalized to all languages making it important to conduct similar experimentations in other languages.",
        "This work aims to design cognitively motivated computational models that can explain the organization and processing of Bangla morphologically complex words in the mental lexicon.",
        "Presently we will concentrate on the following two aspects: ?",
        "Organization and processing of Bangla Poly-morphemic words: our objective here is to determine whether the mental lexicon decomposes morphologically complex words into its constituent morphemes or does it represent the unanalyzed surface form of a word.",
        "?",
        "Organization and processing of Bangla compound verbs (CV): compound verbs are the subject of much debate in linguistic theory.",
        "No consensus has been reached yet with respect to the issue that whether to consider them as unitary lexical units or are they syntactically assembled combinations of two independent lexical units.",
        "As linguistic arguments have so far not led to a consensus, we here use cognitive experiments to probe the brain signatures of verb-verb combinations and propose cognitive as well as computational models regarding the possible organization and processing of Bangla CVs in the mental lexicon (ML).",
        "With respect to this, we apply the different priming and other lexical decision experiments, described in literature (Marslen-Wilson et al., 1994; Bentin, S. and Feldman, 1990) specifically for derivationally suffixed polymorphemic words and compound verbs of Bangla.",
        "Our cross-modal and masked priming experiment on Bangla derivationally suffixed words shows that morphological relatedness between lexical items triggers a significant priming effect, even when the forms are phonologically/orthographically unrelated.",
        "These observations are similar to those reported for English and indicate that derivationally suffixed words in Bangla are in general accessed through decomposition of the word into its constituent morphemes.",
        "Further, based on the experimental data we have developed a series of computational models that can be used to predict the decomposition of Bangla polymorphemic words.",
        "Our evaluation result shows that decomposition of a polymorphemic word depends on several factors like, frequency, productivity of the suffix and the compositionality between the stem and the suffix.",
        "The organization of the paper is as follows: Sec. 2 presents related works; Sec. 3 describes experiment design and procedure; Sec. 4 presents the processing of CVs; and finally, Sec. 5 concludes the paper by presenting the future direction of the work."

        "Over the last few decades many studies have attempted to understand the representation and processing of morphologically complex words in the brain for various languages.",
        "Most of the studies are designed to support one of the two mutually exclusive paradigms: the full-listing and the morphemic model.",
        "The full-listing model claims that polymorphic words are represented as a whole in the human mental lexicon (Bradley, 1980; Butterworth, 1983).",
        "On the other hand, morphemic model argues that morphologically complex words are decomposed and represented in terms of the smaller morphemic units.",
        "The affixes are stripped away from the root form, which in turn are used to access the mental lexicon (Taft and Forster, 1975; Taft, 1981; MacKay, 1978).",
        "Intermediate to these two paradigms is the partial decomposition model that argues that different types of morphological forms are processed separately.",
        "For instance, the derived morphological forms are believed to be represented as a whole, whereas the representation of the inflected forms follows the morphemic model (Caramazza et al., 1988).",
        "Traditionally, priming experiments have been used to study the effects of morphology in language processing.",
        "Priming is a process that results in increase in speed or accuracy of response to a stimulus, called the target, based on the occurrence of a prior exposure of another stimulus, called the prime (Tulving et al., 1982).",
        "Here, subjects are exposed to a prime word for a short duration, and are subsequently shown a target word.",
        "The prime and target words may be morphologically, phonologically or semantically re",
        "lated.",
        "An analysis of the effect of the reaction time of subjects reveals the actual organization and representation of the lexicon at the relevant level.",
        "See Pulverm?ller (2002) for a detailed account of such phenomena.",
        "It has been argued that frequency of a word influences the speed of lexical processing and thus, can serve as a diagnostic tool to observe the nature and organization of lexical representations.",
        "(Taft, 1975) with his experiment on English inflected words, argued that lexical decision responses of polymorphemic words depends upon the base word frequency.",
        "Similar observation for surface word frequency was also observed by (Bertram et al., 2000;Bradley, 1980;Burani et al., 1987;Burani et al., 1984;Schreuder et al., 1997; Taft 1975;Taft, 2004) where it has been claimed that words having low surface frequency tends to decompose.",
        "Later, Baayen(2000) proposed the dual processing race model that proposes that a specific morphologically complex form is accessed via its parts if the frequency of that word is above a certain threshold of frequency, then the direct route will win, and the word will be accessed as a whole.",
        "If it is below that same threshold of frequency, the parsing route will win, and the word will be accessed via its parts."
