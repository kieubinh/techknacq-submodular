        "Research in automatic machine translation (MT) evaluation has the goal of developing a set of computer-based methods that measure accurately the correctness of the output generated by a MT system.",
        "However, this task is a difficult one mainly because there is no unique reference output that can be used in the comparison with the candidate translation.",
        "One sentence can have several correct translations.",
        "Thus, it is difficult to decide if the deviation from an existing reference translation is a matter of style (the use of synonymous words, different syntax etc.)",
        "or a real translation error.",
        "Most of the automatic evaluation metrics developed so far are focused on the idea of lexical matching between the tokens of one or more reference translations and the tokens of a candidate translation.",
        "However, structural similarity between a reference translation and a candidate one cannot be captured by lexical features.",
        "Therefore, research in MT evaluation experiences a gradual shift of focus from lexical metrics to structural ones, whether they are syntactic or semantic or a combination of both.",
        "This paper introduces a new syntactic automatic MT evaluation method.",
        "At this stage of research the new metric is evaluating translations from any source language into German.",
        "Given that a set of constraint-based grammar rules are available for that language, extensions to other target languages are anytime possible.",
        "The chosen tool for providing syntactic information for German is the Weighted Constraints Dependency Grammar (WCDG) parser (Menzel and Schr?der, 1998), which is preferred over other parsers because of its robustness to ungrammatical input, as it is typical for MT output.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 the state of the art in MT evaluation is presented, while in Section 3 the new syntactic metric is described.",
        "The experimental setup and results are presented in Section 4.",

        "Automatic evaluation of MT systems relies on the existence of at least one reference1 created by a human annotator.",
        "Using an automatic method of evaluation a score is computed, based on the similarity between the output of the MT system and the reference.",
        "This similarity can be computed at different levels: lexical, syntactic or semantic.",
        "At the lexical level, the metrics developed so far can be divided into two major categories: n-gram based and edit distance based.",
        "Among the n-gram based metrics, one of the most popular methods of evaluation is BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001).",
        "It provides a score that is computed as the summed number of n-grams shared by the references and the output, divided by the total number of n-grams.",
        "Lexical metrics that use the edit distance are constructed using the Levenshtein distance applied at the word level.",
        "Among these metrics, WER (Niessen et al., 2000) is the one which is used more frequently; it calculates the minimal number of insertion, substitutions and deletions needed to transform the candidate translation into a reference.",
        "Metrics based on lexical matching suffer from not being able to consider the variation encountered in natural language.",
        "Thus, they reward a low score to an otherwise fluent and syntactically correct candidate translation, if it does not share a certain number of words with the set of references.",
        "Because of this, major disagreements between the scores assigned by BLEU and human judgments have been reported in Koehn and Monz (2006) and Callison-Burch et al. (2006).",
        "Another disadvantage is that many of them cannot be applied at the segment level, which is often needed in order to better assess the quality of MT output and to determine which improvements should be made to the MT system.",
        "Because of these disadvantages there is an increasing need for other approaches to MT evaluation that go beyond the lexical level of the phrases compared.",
        "In Liu and Gildea (2005), three syntactic evaluation metrics are presented.",
        "The first of these metrics, the Subtree Metric (SMT), is based on determining the number of subtrees that can be found in both the candidate translation and the reference phrase structure trees.",
        "The second metric, which is a kernel-based subtree metric, is defined as the maximum of the cosine measure between the MT output and the set of references.",
        "The third metric proposed computes the number of matching n-grams between the headword chains of the reference and the candidate translation dependency trees obtained using the parser described in (Collins, 1999).",
        "The idea of syntactic similarity is further exploited in Owczarzak et al. (2007) which uses a Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) parser.",
        "The similarity between the translation and the reference is computed using the precision and the recall of the dependencies that illustrate the pair of sentences.",
        "Furthermore, paraphrases are used in order to improve the correlation with human judgments.",

        "In further experiments we also intend to test CESM using statistical based dependency parsers, like the Malt Parser (Nivre et al., 2007) and the MST parser (McDonald et al., 2006), in order to decide whether the choice of parser influences the performance of the metric.",
        "Another approach that we will explore for improving CESM is to compare dependency parse trees using the base form and the part-of-speech of the tokens, instead of the exact lexical match.",
        "We will try this approach in order to avoid penalizing lexical variation.",
        "The accuracy of CESM can be further increased by the use of paraphrases, which can be obtained by using a German thesaurus or a lexical resource like GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997).",
