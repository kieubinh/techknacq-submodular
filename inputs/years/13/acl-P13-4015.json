        "There, apart from syntactic problems, both head and arms have been translated as if they were",
        "body parts (t?te and bras).",

        "Then BING produces a much better translation: Chef d?",

        "The fact that the formulation of the source can strongly influence the quality of the translation has long been known, and there have been studies indicating that adherence to so-called ?Controlled Language?",
        "guidelines, such as Simplified Technical English2 can reduce the MT post-edition effort.",
        "However, as one such study (O?Brien, 2006) notes, it is unfortunately not sufficient to just ?apply the rules [i.e. guidelines] and press Translate.",
        "We need to analyze the effect that rules are having on different language pairs and MT systems, and we need to tune our rule sets and texts accordingly?.",
        "In the software system presented here, SORT (SOurce Rewriting Tool), we build on the basic insight that formulation of the source needs to be geared to the specific MT model being used, and propose the following approach.",
        "First, we assume that the original source text in English (say) is not necessarily under the user's control, but may be given to her.",
        "While she is a fluent English speaker, she does not know at all the target language, but uses an MT system; crucially, this system is able to provide estimates of the quality of its translations (Specia et al., 2009).",
        "SORT then automatically produces a number of rewritings of each English sentence, translates them with the MT system, and displays to the user those rewritings for which the translation quality estimates are higher than the estimate for the original source.",
        "The user then interactively selects one such rewriting per sentence, checking that it does not distort the original meaning, and finally the translations of these",
        "reformulations are made available.",
        "One advantage of this framework is that the proposed rewritings are implicitly ?aware?",
        "of the underlying strengths and limitations of the specific MT model.",
        "A good quality estimation3 component, for instance, will feel more confident about the translation of an unambiguous word like weapon than about that of an ambiguous one such as arm, or about the translation of a known term in its domain than about a term not seen during training.",
        "Such a tool is especially relevant for business situations where post-edition costs are very high, for instance because of lack of people both expert in the domain and competent in the target language.",
        "Post-edition must be reserved for the most difficult cases, while pre-edition may be easier to organize.",
        "While the setup cannot fully guarantee the accuracy of all translations, it can reduce the number of sentences that need to go through post-edition and the overall cost of this task."

        "These results suggest that rewriting is estimated to improve translation quality.",

        "On a different dimension than translation quality, the large number of cases with no clear winner, and the analysis we conducted, indicate that the user's cognitive effort would be decreased if we only displayed those rewritings associated with a substantial improvement in confidence; due to the nature of our methods, frequently, identical or near-identical translations were generated, with only marginal differences in confidence, e.g., when two source synonyms were translated to the same target word.",
        "Also, often a wrong synonym was suggested as a replacement for a word (e.g. Christmas air for Christmas atmosphere).",
