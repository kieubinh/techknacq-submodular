        "Electronic dictionaries and domain glossaries are definition repositories which prove very useful not only for lookup purposes, but also for automatic tasks such as Question Answering (Cui et al., 2007; Saggion, 2004), taxonomy learning (Navigli et al., 2011; Velardi et al., 2013), domain Word Sense Disambiguation (Duan and Yates, 2010; Faralli and Navigli, 2012), automatic acquisition of semantic predicates (Flati and Navigli, 2013), relation extraction (Yap and Baldwin, 2009) and, more in general, knowledge acquisition (Hovy et al., 2013).",
        "Unfortunately, constructing and updating such resources requires the effort of a team of experts.",
        "Moreover, they are of no help when dealing with new words or usages, or, even worse, new domains.",
        "Nonetheless, raw text often contains several definitional sentences, that is, it provides within itself formal explanations for terms of interest.",
        "Whilst it is not feasible to search texts manually for definitions in several languages, the task of extracting definitional information can be automatized by means of Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.",
        "Many approaches (Snow et al., 2004; Kozareva and Hovy, 2010, inter alia) build upon lexico-syntactic patterns, inspired by the seminal work of Hearst (1992).",
        "However, these methods suffer from two signifiicant drawbacks: on the one hand, low recall (as definitional sentences occur in highly variable syntactic structures), and, on the other hand, noise (because the most frequent definitional pattern ?",
        "X is a Y ?",
        "is inherently very noisy).",
        "A recent approach to definition and hyper-nym extraction, called Word-Class Lattices (Navigli and Velardi, 2010, WCLs), overcomes these issues by addressing the variability of definitional sentences and providing a flexible way of automatically extracting hypernyms from them.",
        "To do so, lattice-based classifiers are learned from a training set of textual definitions.",
        "Training sentences are automatically clustered by similarity and, for each such cluster, a lattice classifier is learned which models the variants of the definition template detected.",
        "A lattice is a directed acyclic graph, a subclass of non-deterministic finite state automata.",
        "The purpose of the lattice structure is to preserve (in a compact form) the salient differences among distinct sequences.",
        "In this paper we present a demonstration of Word-Class Lattices by providing a Java API and a Web application for online usage.",
        "Since multi-linguality is a key need in today's information society, and because WCLs have been tested overwhelmingly only with the English language, we provide experiments for three different languages, namely English, French and Italian.",
        "To do so, in contrast to Navigli and Velardi (2010), who created a manually annotated training set of definitions, we provide a heuristic method for the automatic acquisition of reliable training sets from Wikipedia, and use them to determine the robustness and generalization power of WCLs.",
