        "Other semantic relations that have been investigated systematically in the recent past are entailment, i.e. to what extent text A entails or logically infers text B (Dagan, Glickman, & Magnini, 2004), and elaboration, i.e. is text B is an elaboration of text A?",

        "The vast majority of word-to-word similarity measures that rely on WordNet are concept-to-concept measures and to be able to use them one must map words in the input texts onto concepts in WordNet, i.e. word sense disambiguation (WSD) is needed.",

        "More global text-to-text similarity measures could be defined in several ways as detailed next.",

        "Also, the IR can be transformed into a symmetric similarity measure as in the following (Dagan, Lee, & Pereira, 1997): The Hellinger and Manhattan distances between two distributions are two other options that avoid the shortcomings of the KL distance.",
        "Both are options are implemented in SEMILAR.",
        "LDA similarity measures between two documents or texts c and d can also include similarity of topics.",
        "That is, the text-to-text similarity is obtained multiplying the similarities between the distribution over topics (?d and ?c) and distribution over words (?t1 and ?t2).",
        "The similarity of topics can be computed using the same methods illustrated above as the topics are distributions over words (for all the details see Rus, Banjade, & Niraula, 2013).",
        "The last semantic similarity method presented in this paper is based on the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP).",
        "The QAP method aims at finding an optimal assignment from words in text A to words in text B, based on individual word-to-word similarity measures, while simultaneously maximizing the match between the syntactic dependencies of the words.",
        "The Koopmans-Beckmann (1957) formulation of the QAP problem best fits this purpose.",
        "The goal of the original QAP formulation, in the domain of economic activity, was to minimize the objective function QAP shown below where matrix F describes the flow between any two facilities, matrix D indicates the distances between locations, and matrix B provides the cost of locating facilities to specific locations.",

        "(j), respectively.",
        "The distance between these locations is d?(i)?(j).",
        "In our case, F and D describe dependencies between words in one sentence while B captures the word-to-word similarity between words in opposite sentences.",
