        "Query-focused multi-document summarization (Nenkova et al., 2006; Wan et al., 2007; Ouyang et al., 2010) can facilitate users to grasp the main idea of documents.",
        "In query-focused summarization, a specific topic description, such as a query, which expresses the most important topic information is proposed before the document collection, and a summary would be generated according to the given topic.",
        "Supervised models have been widely used in summarization (Li, et al., 2009, Shen et al., 2007, Ouyang et al., 2010).",
        "Supervised models usually regard summarization as a classification or regression problem and use various sentence features to build a classifier based on labeled negative or positive samples.",
        "However, existing supervised approaches seldom exploit the intrinsic structure among sentences.",
        "This disadvantage usually gives rise to serious problems such as unbalance and low recall in summaries.",
        "Recently, LDA-based (Blei et al., 2003) Bayesian topic models have widely been applied in multi-document summarization in that Bayesian approaches can offer clear and rigorous probabilistic interpretations for summaries(Daumé and Marcu, 2006; Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009; Jin et al., 2010; Mason and Charniak, 2011; Delort and Alfon-seca, 2012).",
        "Exiting Bayesian approaches label sentences or words with topics and sentences which are closely related with query or can highly generalize documents are selected into summaries.",
        "However, LDA topic model suffers from the intrinsic disadvantages that it only uses word frequency for topic modeling and can not use useful text features such as position, word order etc (Zhu and Xing, 2010).",
        "For example, the first sentence in a document may be more important for summary since it is more likely to give a global generalization about the document.",
        "It is hard for LDA model to consider such information, making useful information lost.",
        "It naturally comes to our minds that we can improve summarization performance by making full use of both useful text features and the latent semantic structures from by LDA topic model.",
        "One related work is from Celikyilmaz and Hakkani-Tur (2010).",
        "They built a hierarchical topic model called Hybh-sum based on LDA for topic discovery and assumed this model can produce appropriate scores for sentence evaluation.",
        "Then the scores are used for tuning the weights of various features that helpful for summary generation.",
        "Their work made a good step of combining topic model with feature based supervised learning.",
        "However, what their approach confuses us is that whether a topic model only based on word frequency is good enough to generate an appropriate sentence score for regression.",
        "Actually, how to incorporate features into LDA topic model has been a open problem.",
        "Supervised topic models such as sLDA(Blei and MacAuliffe 2007) give us some inspiration.",
        "In sLDA, each document is associated with a labeled feature and sLDA can integrate such feature into LDA for topic modeling in a prin",
        "cipled way.",
        "With reference to the work of supervised LDA models, in this paper, we propose a novel sentence feature based Bayesian model S-sLDA for multi-document summarization.",
        "Our approach can naturally combine feature based supervised methods and topic models.",
        "The most important and challenging problem in our model is the tuning of feature weights.",
        "To solve this problem, we transform the problem of finding optimum feature weights into an optimization algorithm and learn these weights in a supervised way.",
        "A set of experiments are conducted based on the benchmark data of DUC2007, TAC2008 and TAC2009, and experimental results show the effectiveness of our model.",
