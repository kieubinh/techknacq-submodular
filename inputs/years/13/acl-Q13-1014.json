        "For them, MT is science fact.",
        "So it makes sense to teach statistical MT, either on its own or as a unit ?",
        "The first five authors were instructors and the remaining authors were students in the worked described here.",
        "This research was conducted while Chris Callison-Burch was at Johns Hopkins University.",
        "in a class on natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), or artificial intelligence (AI).",
        "A course that promises to show students how Google Translate works and teach them how to build something like it is especially appealing, and several universities and summer schools now offer such classes.",
        "There are excellent introductory texts?depending on the level of detail required, instructors can choose from a comprehensive MT textbook (Koehn, 2010), a chapter of a popular NLP textbook (Jurafsky and Martin, 2009), a tutorial survey (Lopez, 2008), or an intuitive tutorial on the IBM Models (Knight, 1999b), among many others.",
        "But MT is not just an object of academic study.",
        "It's a real application that isn't fully perfected, and the best way to learn about it is to build an MT system.",
        "This can be done with open-source toolkits such as Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), cdec (Dyer et al., 2010), or Joshua (Ganitkevitch et al., 2012), but these systems are not designed for pedagogy.",
        "They are mature codebases featuring tens of thousands of source code lines, making it difficult to focus on their core algorithms.",
        "Most tutorials present them as black boxes.",
        "But our goal is for students to learn the key techniques in MT, and ideally to learn by doing.",
        "Black boxes are incompatible with this goal.",
        "We solve this dilemma by presenting students with concise, fully-functioning, self-contained components of a statistical MT system: word alignment, decoding, evaluation, and reranking.",

        "Our hope was that these requirements would balance the perceived competitive advantage of collaboration against a reluctance to take (and thus support) teammates who did not contribute to the competitive effort.6 This strategy worked: out of sixteen students, ten opted to work collaboratively on at least one assignment, always in pairs.",

        "In early assignments, we observed a few cases of this behavior, so for the remaining assignments, we modified the leaderboard so that changes in score would only be reflected once every twelve hours.",
        "This strategy trades some amount of scientific realism for some measure of incentive, a strategy that has proven effective in other pedagogical tools with real-time feedback (Spacco et al., 2006).",
