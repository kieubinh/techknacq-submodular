        "Science journalism is also a highly relevant domain for information retrieval in the context of educational as well as entertaining applications.",
        "Article quality measures can hugely benefit such systems.",
        "Prior work indicates that three aspects of article quality can be successfully predicted: a) whether a text meets the acceptable standards for spelling (Brill and Moore, 2000), grammar (Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010) and discourse organization (Barzilay et al., 2002; Lapata, 2003); b) has a topic that is interesting to a particular user.",

        "Shorter words (Flesch, 1948), less complex syntax (Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005) and high cohesion between sentences (Graesser et al., 2004) typically indicate easier and more ?readable?",
        "articles.",
        "Less understood is the question of what makes an article interesting and beautifully written.",
        "An early and influential work on readability (Flesch, 1948) also computed an interest measure with the hypothesis that interesting articles would be easier to read.",
        "More recently, McIntyre and Lapata (2009) found that people's ratings of interest for fairy tales can be successfully predicted using token-level scores related to syntactic items and categories from a psycholinguistic database.",
        "But large scale studies of interest measures for adult educated readers have not been carried out.",
        "Further, there have been little attempts to measure article quality in a genre-specific setting.",
        "But it is reasonable to expect that properties related to the unique aspects of a genre should contribute to the prediction of quality in the same way that domain-specific spelling and grammar correction (Cucerzan and Brill, 2004; Bao et al., 2011; Dale and Kilgar-riff, 2010) techniques have been successful.",
        "Here we address the above two issues by developing measures related to interesting and well-written nature specifically for science journalism.",
        "Central to our work is a corpus of science news articles with two categories: written by popular journalists and typical articles in science columns (Section 2).",
        "We introduce a set of genre-specific features related to beautiful writing, visual nature and affective content (Section 3) and show that they have high predictive accuracies, 20% above the baseline, for distinguishing our quality categories (Section 4).",
        "Our final system combines the measures for interest and genre-specific features with those proposed for identifying readable, well-written and topically interesting articles, giving an accuracy of 84% (Section 5).",
