        "Given two snippets of text, Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) captures the notion that some texts are more similar than others, measuring the degree of semantic equivalence.",
        "Textual similarity can range from exact semantic equivalence to complete un-relatedness, corresponding to quantified values between 5 and 0.",
        "The graded similarity intuitively captures the notion of intermediate shades of similarity such as pairs of text differ only in some minor nuanced aspects of meaning only, to relatively important differences in meaning, to sharing only some details, or to simply being related to the same topic, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "One of the goals of the STS task is to create a unified framework for combining several semantic components that otherwise have historically tended to be evaluated independently and without characterization of impact on NLP applications.",
        "By providing such a framework, STS will allow for an extrinsic evaluation for these modules.",
        "Moreover, this STS framework itself could in turn be evaluated intrinsically and extrinsically as a grey/black box within various NLP applications such as Machine Translation (MT), Summarization, Generation, Question Answering (QA), etc.",
        "STS is related to both Textual Entailment (TE) and Paraphrasing, but differs in a number of ways and it is more directly applicable to a number of NLP tasks.",
        "STS is different from TE inasmuch as it assumes bidirectional graded equivalence between the pair of textual snippets.",
        "In the case of TE the equivalence is directional, e.g. a car is a vehicle, but a vehicle is not necessarily a car.",
        "STS also differs from both TE and Paraphrasing (in as far as both tasks have been defined to date in the literature) in that, rather than being a binary yes/no decision (e.g. a vehicle is not a car), we define STS to be a graded similarity notion (e.g. a vehicle and a car are more similar than a wave and a car).",
