        "The task of semantic textual similarity (STS) is to measure the degree of semantic equivalence between two sentences, which plays an increasingly important role in natural language processing (NLP) applications.",

        "In information retrieval (Sahami and Heil-man, 2006), text similarity improves the effectiveness of a semantic search engine by providing information which holds high similarity with the input query.",
        "In machine translation (Kauchak and Barzi-lay, 2006), sentence similarity can be applied for automatic evaluation of the output translation and the reference translations.",
        "In question answering (Mohler and Mihalcea, 2009), once the question and the candidate answers are treated as two texts, the answer text which has a higher relevance with the question text may have higher probability to be the right one.",
        "The STS task in ?SEM Shared Task 2013 consists of two subtasks, i.e., core task and typed task, and we participate in both of them.",
        "The core task aims to measure the semantic similarity of two sentences, resulting in a similarity score which ranges from 5 (semantic equivalence) to 0 (no relation).",
        "The typed task is a pilot task on typed-similarity between semi-structured records.",
        "The types of similarity to be measured include location, author, people involved, time, events or actions, subject and description as well as the general similarity of two texts (Agirre et al., 2013).",
        "In this work we present a Support Vector Regression (SVR) system to measure sentence semantic similarity by integrating multiple measurements, i.e., string similarity, knowledge based similarity, corpus based similarity, number similarity and machine translation metrics.",
        "Most of these similarities are borrowed from previous work, e.g., (Ba?r et al., 2012), (S?aric et al., 2012) and (de Souza et al., 2012).",
        "We also propose a novel syntactic dependency similarity.",
