        "Most previous work on measuring MWE compositionality makes use of lexical, syntactic or semantic properties of the MWE.",
        "One early study on MWE compositionality was Lin (1999), who claimed that the distribution of non-compositional MWEs (e.g. shoot the breeze) differs significantly from the distribution of expressions formed by substituting one of the components with a semantically similar word (e.g. shoot the wind).",
        "Unfortunately, the method tends to fall down in cases of high statistical idiosyncrasy (or ?institutionalization?",
        "): consider frying pan which is compositional but distributionally very different to phrases produced through word-substitution such as sauteing pan or frying plate.",
        "Some research has investigated the syntactic properties of MWEs, to detect their compositionality (Fazly et al., 2009; McCarthy et al., 2007).",
        "The assumption behind these methods is that non-compositional MWEs are more syntactically fixed than compositional MWEs.",
        "For example, make a decision can be passivised, but shoot the breeze cannot.",
        "One serious problem with syntax-based methods is their lack of generalization: each type of MWE has its own characteristics, and these characteristics differ from one language to another.",
        "Moreover, some MWEs (such as noun compounds) are not flexible syntactically, no matter whether they are compositional or non-compositional (Reddy et al., 2011).",
        "Much of the recent work on MWEs focuses on their semantic properties, measuring the semantic similarity between the MWE and its components using different resources, such as WordNet (Kim and Baldwin, 2007) or distributional similarity relative to a corpus (e.g. based on Latent Semantic Analysis: Schone and Jurafsky (2001), Bannard et al. (2003), Reddy et al. (2011)).",
        "The size of the corpus is important in methods based on distributional similarity.",
        "Unfortunately, however, large corpora are not available for all languages.",
        "Reddy et al. (2011) hypothesize that the number of common co-occurrences between a given MWE and its component words indicates the degree of compositionality of that MWE.",
        "First, the co-occurrences of a given MWE/word are considered as the values of a vector.",
        "They then measure the Cosine similarity between the vectors of the MWE and its components.",
        "Bannard et al. (2003) presented four methods to measure the compositionality of English verb particle constructions.",
        "Their best result is based on the previously-discussed method of Lin (1999) for measuring compositionality, but uses a more-general distributional similarity model to identify synonyms.",
        "Recently, a few studies have investigated using parallel corpora to detect the degree of compositionality (Melamed, 1997; Moiro?n and Tiedemann, 2006; de Caseli et al., 2010; Salehi et al., 2012).",
        "The general approach is to word-align the source and target language sentences and analyse alignment patterns for MWEs (e.g. if the MWE is always aligned as a single ?phrase?, then it is a strong indicator of non-compositionality).",
        "de Caseli et al.",
        "(2010) consider non-compositional MWEs to be those candidates that align to the same target language unit, without decomposition into word alignments.",
        "Melamed (1997) suggests using mutual information to investigate how well the translation model predicts the distribution of words in the target text given the distribution of words in the source text.",
        "Moiro?n and Tiedemann (2006) show that entropy is a good indicator of compositionality, because word alignment models are often confused by non-compositional MWEs.",
        "However, this assumption does not always hold, especially when dealing with high-frequency non-compositional MWEs.",
        "Salehi et al. (2012) tried to solve this problem with high frequency MWEs by using word alignment in both directions.",
        "They computed backward and forward entropy to try to remedy the problem with especially high-frequency phrases.",
        "However, their assumptions were not easily generalisable across languages, e.g., they assume that the relative frequency of a specific type of MWE (light verb constructions) in Persian is much greater than in English.",
        "Although methods using bilingual corpora are intuitively appealing, they have a number of drawbacks.",
        "The first and the most important problem",
        "is data: they need large-scale parallel bilingual corpora, which are available for relatively few language pairs.",
        "Second, since they use statistical measures, they are not suitable for measuring the compositionality of MWEs with low frequency.",
        "And finally, most experiments have been carried out on English paired with other European languages, and it is not clear whether the results translate across to other language pairs."

        "In this study, we proposed a method to predict MWE compositionality based on the translation of the MWE and its component words into multiple languages.",
        "We used string similarity measures between the translations of the MWE and each of its components to predict the relative degree of compositionality.",
        "Among the four similarity measures that we experimented with, LCS and SW were found to be superior to edit distance-based methods.",
        "Our best results were found to be competitive with state-of-the-art results using vector-based approaches, and were also shown to complement state-of-the-art methods.",
        "In future work, we are interested in investigating whether alternative ways of combining our proposed method with vector-based models can lead to further enhancements in results.",
        "These models could be especially effective when comparing translations which are roughly synonymous but not string-wise similar."
