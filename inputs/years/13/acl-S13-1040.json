        "Automatic metaphor identification and interpretation in text have been traditionally considered as two separate tasks in natural language processing (NLP) and addressed individually within computational frameworks.",
        "However, cognitive evidence suggests that humans are likely to perform these two tasks simultaneously, as part of a holistic metaphor comprehension process.",
        "We present a novel method that performs metaphor identification through its interpretation, being the first one in NLP to combine the two tasks in one step.",
        "It outperforms the previous approaches to metaphor identification both in terms of accuracy and coverage, as well as providing an interpretation for each identified expression."

        "Metaphor undoubtedly gives our expression more vividness, distinction and artistry, however, it is also an important linguistic tool that has long become part of our everyday language.",
        "Metaphors arise",
        "when one concept or domain is viewed in terms of the properties of another (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980).",
        "Consider the examples in (1) and (2).",
        "(1) My car drinks gasoline.",
        "(Wilks, 1978) (2) This policy is strangling business.",
        "The car in (1) and business in (2) are viewed as living beings and thus they can drink or be strangled respectively.",
        "The mapping between the car (the target concept) and living being (the source concept) is systematic and results in a number of metaphorical expressions (e.g. ?This oil gives your car a second life?, ?this car has is very temperamental?",
        "etc.)",
        "Lakoff and Johnson call such generalisations a source?target domain mapping, or conceptual metaphor.",
        "The ubiquity of metaphor in language has been established in a number of corpus studies (Cameron, 2003; Martin, 2006; Steen et al., 2010; Shutova and Teufel, 2010) and the role it plays in human reasoning has been confirmed in psychological experiments (Thibodeau and Boroditsky, 2011).",
        "This makes its automatic processing an important problem for NLP and its numerous applications (such as machine translation, information extraction, opinion mining and many others).",
        "For example, the use of the metaphorical verb strangle in (2) reflects the speaker's negative opinion regarding the government's tight business regulations, which would be an important fact for an opinion mining system to discover (Narayanan, 1999).",
        "Other experiments (Agerri, 2008) have investigated and confirmed the role of metaphor interpretation for textual entailment resolution (RTE).",
        "The problem of metaphor modeling is rapidly gaining interest within NLP, with a growing number of approaches exploiting statistical techniques (Mason, 2004; Gedigian et al., 2006; Shutova, 2010; Shutova et al., 2010; Turney et al., 2011; Shutova et al., 2012a).",
        "Compared to more traditional approaches based on hand-coded knowledge (Fass, 1991; Martin, 1990; Narayanan, 1997; Narayanan, 1999; Feldman and Narayanan, 2004; Barnden and Lee, 2002; Agerri et al., 2007), these more recent methods tend to have a wider coverage, as well as be more efficient, accurate and robust.",
        "However, even the statistical metaphor processing approaches so far often focused on a limited domain or a subset of",
        "phenomena (Gedigian et al., 2006; Krishnakumaran and Zhu, 2007), and required training data (Shutova et al., 2010; Turney et al., 2011), often resulting in a limited coverage.",
        "The metaphor processing task itself has been most commonly addressed in NLP as two individual subtasks: metaphor identification and metaphor interpretation, with the systems focusing only on one of them at a time, or at best combing the two in a pipeline (Shutova et al., 2012a).",
        "Metaphor identification systems annotate metaphorical language in text, and metaphor interpretation systems discover literal meanings of the previously annotated expressions.",
        "However, cognitive evidence suggests that humans are likely to perform identification and interpretation simultaneously, as part of a holistic metaphor comprehension process (Coul-son, 2008; Utsumi, 2011; Gibbs and Colston, 2012).",
        "In this paper, we also take this stance and present the first computational method that identifies metaphorical expressions in unrestricted text by means of their interpretation.",
        "Following Shutova (2010), we define metaphor interpretation as a task of finding a literal paraphrase for a metaphorically used word and introduce the concept of symmetric reverse paraphrasing as a criterion for metaphor identification.",
        "The main assumption behind our method is that the literal paraphrases of literally-used words should yield the original phrase when paraphrased in reverse.",
        "For example, when the expression ?clean the house?",
        "is paraphrased as ?tidy the house?, the reverse paraphrasing of tidy would generate clean.",
        "Our expectation is that such a symmetry in paraphrasing is indicative of literal use.",
        "The metaphorically-used words are unlikely to exhibit this symmetry property when paraphrased in reverse.",
        "For example, the literal paraphrasing of the verb stir in ?stir excitement?",
        "would yield ?provoke excitement?, but the reverse paraphrasing of provoke would not retrieve stir, indicating the non-literal use of stir.",
        "We experimentally verify this hypothesis in a setting involving single-word metaphors expressed by a verb in verb-subject and verb-direct object relations.",
        "We apply the selectional preference-based metaphor paraphrasing method of Shutova (2010) to retrieve literal paraphrases of all input verbs and extend the method to perform metaphor identification.",
        "In summary, our system (1) determines the likelihood of a verb being metaphorical based on its selectional preference strength (Resnik, 1993); (2) identifies a set of literal paraphrases for verbs that may be used metaphorically using the algorithm of Shutova (2010); (3) performs reverse paraphrasing of each of the identified paraphrases, aiming to retrieve the original expression; and (4) if the original expression is retrieved then the verb is tagged as literal, otherwise it is tagged as metaphorical.",
        "We evaluated the performance of the system using the manually annotated metaphor corpus of Shutova and Teufel (2010) in precision-and recall-oriented settings.",
        "In addition, we compared its performance to that of a baseline using selectional preference violation as an indicator of metaphor, as well as to two previous metaphor identification approaches of Shutova et al. (2010) and Turney et al. (2011)."

        "One of the early influential ideas in the field of computational metaphor processing is that metaphor represents a violation of selectional preferences (SP) of a word in a given context (Wilks, 1975; Wilks, 1978).",
        "However, applied directly as an identification criterion, violation of SPs is also indicative of many other linguistic phenomena (e.g. metonymy), and not only metaphor, which is problematic.",
        "We modify this view and apply it to measure the potential of a word to be used metaphorically based on its selectional preference strength (SPS).",
        "The main intuition behind SPS filtering is that not all verbs have an equal potential of being a metaphor.",
        "For example, verbs such as choose, remember, describe or like do not have a strong preference for their direct objects and are equally likely to appear with many argument classes.",
        "If metaphor represents a violation of SPs, then the verbs with weak SPS are unlikely to be used metaphorically in any context.",
        "For every verb in the input text, the filter determines their likelihood of being a metaphor based on their SPS and discards the weak ones.",
        "The SPS filter is context-free, and the reverse paraphrasing method is then applied in the next steps to determine if the remaining verbs are indeed used metaphorically in the given context.",
        "We automatically acquired selectional preference distributions for verb-subject and verb-direct object relations from the British National Corpus (BNC) (Burnard, 2007) that was parsed using the RASP parser (Briscoe et al., 2006; Andersen et al., 2008).",

        "Overall, the most frequent system errors fall into the following categories: Errors due to incorrect parsing: The system failed to discover some of the metaphorical expressions in the corpus since their grammatical relations were missed by the parser.",
        "In addition, some of the instances were misclassified, e.g. ?pounds paid to [...]?",
        "or ?change was greatly accelerated?",
        "were la-beled as subject relations.",
        "Overall, the parser missed 9 metaphorical expressions.",
        "Errors due to incorrect paraphrasing: The most common type of error that leads to false positives is the incorrect paraphrasing (resulting in a change of meaning).",
        "This makes it nearly impossible for the system to retrieve the original term.",
        "There were also",
        "cases where the system could not generate any paraphrase (usually for literal expressions, e.g. ?play an anthem?).",
        "Errors due to metaphorical paraphrasing: Some of the system errors are due to metaphorical paraphrasing.",
        "For example, the metaphorical expression ?mend marriage?",
        "was paraphrased as ?repair marriage?, which is also used metaphorically.",
        "And repair in return generated mend, when paraphrased in reverse.",
        "Errors of this type have been mainly triggered by the WordNet filter, and the fact that some metaphorical senses are included in WordNet.",
        "Errors due to metaphor conventionality: a number of conventional metaphors were missed by the system, since the original verb was retrieved due to its conventionality.",
        "Such examples include ?impose a decision?, ?put the issue forward?, ?lead a life?.",
        "Such cases suggest that the system is better suited to identify more creative, novel metaphors.",
        "Cases of metonymy: a few cases of general metonymy were annotated by the system as metaphorical, e.g. ?shout support?, which stands for ?shout the words of support?, and ?humiliate a moment?, that is likely to mean ?humiliate the event of the moment?.",
        "However, there were only 4 errors of this type in the data.",
        "Baseline Errors: The output of the baseline exhibited two main types of error.",
        "The first stemmed from the conventionality of many metaphorical expressions, which resulted in their literal annotation.",

        "class as its top ranked direct object argument with the selectional association of 0.18.",
        "The second type of error was the system selecting many language anomalies that violate selectional preferences and tagging these as metaphors.",
        "This resulted in a high number of false positives."

        "Previous research on metaphor addressed a number of its aspects using both symbolic and statistical techniques.",
        "While some of this work met with success with respect to precision in metaphor annotation, the methods often focused on a limited domain and needed manually-labeled training data.",
        "Their dependence on manually annotated training data made the systems hard to scale.",
        "As a result, many of these systems are not directly applicable to aid real-world NLP due to their limited coverage.",
        "In contrast, our method does not require any manually-labeled data, which makes it more robust and applicable to a wide range of genres.",
        "It is also the first one to perform accurate metaphor identification and interpretation in one step, as opposed to the previous systems focusing on one part of the task only.",
        "It identifies metaphor with a precision of 68% and a recall of 66%, which is a very encouraging result.",
        "We believe that this work has important implications for computational modeling of metaphor, and is relevant to a range of other semantic tasks within NLP.",
        "Although we have so far tested our system on verb-subject and verb-object metaphors only, we believe that the described identification and paraphrasing techniques can be similarly applied to a wider range of syntactic constructions.",
        "Extending the system to deal with more parts of speech and types of phrases (e.g. nominal and adjectival metaphors) is part of our future work.",
        "Another promising future research avenue is integrating the techniques with unsupervised paraphrasing and lexical substitution methods, using e.g. distributional similarity measures (Pucci et al., 2009; McCarthy et al., 2010) or vector space models of word meaning (Erk and Pado?, 2008; Erk and Pado?, 2009; De Cao and Basili, 2009; Shutova et al., 2012b).",
        "These methods could fully or partly replace the WordNet filter in the detection of similar basic features of the concepts, or add useful information to it.",
        "Fully replacing the WordNet filter by an unsupervised method would make the system more robust and more easily portable across domains and genres.",
        "This may also eliminate some of the system errors that arise from the inconsistent sense annotation and the inclusion of some metaphorical senses in WordNet."
