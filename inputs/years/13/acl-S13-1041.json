        "The nature of the reading comprehension task is that the student is asked to show that he or she has understood the text at hand.",
        "Questions focus on one or more pieces of information from the text, and correct responses should contain the relevant semantic content.",
        "In the language learning context, responses classified as correct might still contain grammatical or spelling errors; the focus lies on the content rather than the form of the learner answer.",
        "Automatic scoring of short answer responses to reading comprehension questions is in essence a textual entailment task, with the additional complication that, in order to answer a question correctly, the learner must have identified the right portion of the text.",
        "It isn't enough that a student answer is entailed by some part of the reading text; it must be entailed by the part of the text which is responsive to the question under discussion.",
        "Previous approaches to automatic short answer scoring have seldom considered the reading text itself, instead comparing student answers to target answers supplied by instructors; we will refer to these as answer-based models.",
        "In this paper we explore the role of the text for short answer scoring, evaluating several models for considering the text in automatic scoring, and presenting results of an annotation study regarding the semantic links between reading texts and answers to reading comprehension questions."

        "For example, Mohler et al. (2011) and Mohler and Mihalcea (2009) use semantic graph alignments and semantic similarity measures to assess student answers to computer science questions, comparing them to sample solutions provided by a teacher.",
        "Accordingly, not all SAS settings include reading or other reference texts; many involve only questions, target answers, and learner answers.",
        "Our approach is relevant for scenarios in which some sort",
        "of reference text is available.",
        "The work we present here is strongly based on approaches towards SAS by Meurers and colleagues (Bailey and Meurers, 2008; Meurers et al., 2011a; Meurers et al., 2011b; Ziai et al., 2012).",
        "Specifically, the sentence alignment model described in Section 3 (and again discussed in Section 4) is modeled after the one used by Meurers et al. to align target answers and student answers.",
        "Rather than using answers provided by instructors, Nielsen et al. (2008) represent target answers to science questions as a set of hand-annotated facets, i.e. important aspects of the answer, typically represented by a pair of words and the relation that connects them.",

        "a linked sentence (e.g. nolink cases) are immediately classified as incorrect.",
        "The third approach (alt-set) exploits that fact that in many cases annotators provided alternate source sentences.",

        "Along these lines, we will further investigate the sets of alternatives provided by annotators, as well as bringing in notions from work on paraphrasing and recognizing textual entailment.",
        "Finally, we are interested in moving from simple binary classification to the fine-grained level of diagnosis."
