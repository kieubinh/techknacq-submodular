        "The Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment (CLTE) task consists in determining the type of directional entailment (i.e. forward, backward, bidirectional or no-entailment) between a pair of texts T1 and T2, each one written in different languages (Negri et al., 2013).",
        "The texts and reference annotations for this task were obtained through crowdsourcing applied to simpler subtasks (Negri et al., 2011).",
        "CLTE has as main applications content synchronization and aggregation in different languages (Mehdad et al., 2012; Duh et al., 2013).",
        "We participated in the first evaluation of this task in 2012 (Negri et al., 2012), achieving third place on average among 29 participating systems (Jimenez et al., 2012).",
        "Since in the CLTE task text pairs are in different languages, in our system, all comparisons made between two texts imply that one of them was written by a human and the other is a translation provided by statistical machine translation (SMT).",
        "Our approach is based on an SVM classifier (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) whose features were cardinalities combined with similarity scores.",
        "That system was motivated by the fact that most text similarity functions are symmetric, e.g. Edit Distance (Levenshtein, 1966), longest common subsequence (Hirschberg, 1977), Jaro-Winkler similarity (Winkler, 1990), cosine similarity (Salton et al., 1975).",
        "Thus, the use of these functions as only resource seems counter-intuitive since CLTE task is asymmetric for the forward and backward entailment classes.",
        "Moreover, cardinality is the central component of the resemblance coefficients such as Jaccard, Dice, overlap, etc.",
        "For instance, if T1 and T2 are texts represented as bag of words, it is only necessary to know the cardinalities |T1|, |T2 |and |T1 ?",
        "T2 |to obtain a similarity score using a resemblance coefficient such as the Dice's coefficient (i.e. 2 ?",
        "|T1 ?",
        "T2|/(|T1 |+ |T2|)).",
        "Therefore, the idea is to use the individual cardinalities to enrich a set of features extracted from texts.",
        "Cardinality gives a rough idea of the amount of information in a collection of elements (i.e. words) providing the number of different elements therein.",
        "That is, in a collection of elements whose majority are repetitions contains less information than a collection whose elements are mostly different.",
        "However, the classical sets cardinality is a rigid measure as do not take account the degree of similarity among the elements.",
        "Unlike the sets cardinality, soft cardinality (Jimenez et al., 2010) uses the similarities among the elements providing a more flexible",
        "measurement of the amount of information in a collection.",
        "In the 2012 CLTE evaluation campaign, it was noted that the soft cardinality overcame classical cardinality in the task at hand.",
        "All the models used in our participation and proposed in this paper are based on the soft cardinality.",
        "A brief description of the soft cardinality is presented in Section 2, along with a description of the functions used to provide the similarities between words.",
        "Besides, the set of features that are derived from all pairs of texts and their cardinalities are presented in Section 3.",
        "Section 4 provides a detailed description for each of the 4 models (one for each language pair) used to get the predictions submitted for evaluation.",
        "In Section 5 a simplified-multilingual model is tested with several word-similarity functions and circular-pivoting translations.",
        "In sections 6 and 7 a brief discussion of the results and conclusions of our participation in this evaluation campaign are presented."
