        "As an example, from a report like: The overall death toll has risen to 160 since the beginning of the year, after 2 patients in Gulu and 2 in Masindi died on Tue 5 Dec 2000. a system might be prevented to wrongly sum up the two victim counts (160+4) only if it is made aware of the inclusion relation between the first time interval and the date, which in turn implies normalizing the two temporal expressions.",
        "Currently, FSS-TimEx is deployed for French, English and Italian and extensions are foreseen for further languages.",
        "Given such requirements for mul-tilinguality, we developed FSS-TimEx using a linguistically lightweight approach, applying shallow processing modules only.",
        "On the other hand, as we need to extract highly structured information out of the detected temporal expressions, to be used in the subsequent normalization phase, we mostly opted for a rule-based approach, using finite-state grammar cascades, rather than machine learning methods.",
        "Nonetheless, some of the required lexicons were semi-automatically learned.",
        "In our participation in Tasks A and B of the TempEval-3, we experimented with adapting an existing timex recognition module for the English language, to Spanish.",
        "We first describe our system in 2,3 and 4, then in 5 we show and shortly discuss the results for Task A and Task B, and conclude with some thoughts on prospective developments."
