        "The temporal location and ordering of these events are either specified or implied.",
        "Automatic identification of time expressions and events and annotation of temporal relations constitute an important task in text analysis.",
        "These are also important in a wide range of NLP applications that include temporal question answering, machine translation and document summarization.",
        "A lot of research in the area of temporal information extraction has been conducted on multiple languages, including English and several European languages.",
        "The TimeML was first developed in 2002 in an extended workshop called TERQAS (Time and Event Recognition for Question Answering Systems) and, in 2003, it was further developed in the context of the TANGO workshop (TimeML Annotation Graphical Organizer).",
        "Since then most of the works in this research arena have been conducted in English.",
        "The variety of works include TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003), the development of a temporally annotated corpus Time-Bank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003), the temporal evaluation challenges TempEval-1 (Verhagen et al., 2007), TempEval-2 (Pustejovsky and Verhagen, 2010).",

        "In the series of TempEval evaluation exercises, TempEval-1 was the first one where the focus was on identification of three types of temporal relation: relation between an event and a time expression in the same sentence, relation between an",
        "event and the document creation time, and relation between two main events in consecutive sentences.",
        "TempEval-2 was a follow up to TempEval-1 and consisted of six subtasks rather than three.",
        "It added (i) identification of time expressions and determination of values of the attributes TYPE and VAL (ii) identification of event expressions and determination of its attribute values.",
        "It included the previous three relation tasks from TempEval-1 and an additional task of annotating temporal relation between a pair of events where one subordinates the other.",
        "We have participated in all three tasks of TempEval-3- Task A, Task B and Task C. A combination of CRF based machine learning and rule based techniques has been adopted for temporal expression extraction and determination of attribute values of the same (Task A).",
