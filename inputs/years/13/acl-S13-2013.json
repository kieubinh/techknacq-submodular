        "SUTIME is a rule-based temporal tagger built on regular expression patterns over tokens.",
        "Temporal expressions are bounded in their complexity, so many of them can be captured using finite automata.",
        "As shown by systems such as FASTUS (Hobbs et al., 1997), a cascade of finite automata can be very effective at extracting information from text.",
        "With SUTIME, we follow a similar staged strategy of (i) building up patterns over individual words to find numerical expressions; then (ii) using patterns over words and numerical expressions to find simple temporal expressions; and finally (iii) forming composite patterns over the discovered temporal expressions.",
        "SUTIME recognizes Time, Duration, Interval, and Set according to the TIMEX3 specification.",
        "In",
        "addition, it recognizes nested time expressions and duration ranges.",
        "To achieve this it uses a temporal pattern language defined over tokens (a regular expression language for expressing how tokenized text should be mapped to temporal objects).",
        "SUTIME is built on top of TOKENSREGEX,4 a generic framework included in Stanford CoreNLP for definining patterns over text and mapping to semantic objects.",
        "With TOKENSREGEX we have access to any annotations provided by the Stanford CoreNLP system, such as the part-of-speech tag or the lemma.",
        "The full specification of the pattern language is available at nlp.stanford.edu/software/sutime.shtml.",
        "To recognize temporal expressions, SUTIME applies three types of rules, in the following order: 1) text regex rules: mappings from simple regular expressions over characters or tokens to temporal representations; 2) compositional rules: mappings from regular expressions over chunks (both tokens and temporal objects) to temporal representations and 3) filtering rules: in which ambiguous expressions that are likely to not be temporal expressions are removed from the list of candidates (such as fall and spring by themselves).",
        "The compositional rules are applied repeatedly until the final list of time expressions stablizes.",
        "After all the temporal expressions have been recognized, each temporal expression is associated with a temporal object.",
        "Each temporal object is resolved with respect to the reference date using heuristic rules.",
        "In this step, relative times are converted to an absolute time, and composite time objects are simplified as much as possible.",
        "The final resolution of relative temporal expressions is currently limited due to the usage of simple hard-coded rules (e.g. relative to document date with local context informing before and after heuristics).",
        "Finally, SUTIME will take the internal time representation and produce a TIMEX3 annotation for each temporal expression.",
        "SUTIME currently only handles English.",
        "It can however, be extended to other languages by creating sets of rules for additional languages."

        "For the evaluation of extents, there are two metrics: a relaxed match score for identifying a matching temporal expression, and a strict match that requires the text to be matched exactly.",
        "For example, identifying the twentieth century when the gold is twentieth centry will give a relaxed match but not a strict match.",
        "For the type and value attributes, an accuracy and a measure of the F1 with respect to the relaxed match is given.",
        "We compare SUTIME's performance with several other top systems on the English TempEval-3 Task A.",

        "The performance of Navy-Time is otherwise identical to SUTIME.",
        "In Navy-Time the normalization was tuned to the TimeBank annotation whereas the SUTIME submission was untuned.",

        "Given the small size of the platinum data set, we were able to perform thorough error analysis of the errors made by SUTIME on the data set.",
        "Table 2 shows the number of temporal expressions marked by the evaluation script as being incorrect.",
        "The errors can be grouped into three broad categories: i) those proposed by the system but not in the gold (relaxed precision errors), ii) those in the gold but not identified by the system (relaxed recall errors), and iii) temporal expressions with the wrong value (and sometimes type) normalization.",
        "Of the 14 precision errors, many of the temporal expressions suggested by the system are reasonable.",
        "For instance, current is identified by the system.",
        "A few of the errors are not actual temporal expressions.",
        "For example, in the phrase British Summer Time, Summer was identified as a temporal expression which is not correct.",
        "Given SUTime's high recall, only a few temporal expressions in the gold are not found by the system.",
        "In most cases, the temporal expressions missed by SUTIME do not have a well defined value associated with them (e.g. ?digital age?, ?each season?).",
        "Performance using the strict match metric is not as good as some other systems.",
        "SUTIME was derived from GUTime (Mani, 2004) and focuses on matching longer time expressions as per earlier guidelines.",
        "Thus it is less conformant to the more current TimeML guidelines of having minimal blocks.",
        "For instance, SUTIME treats 2009-2010 as a range, whereas the gold standard treats it as two separate dates.",
        "This results in an incorrect value normalization and a recall error.",
        "We now examine the cases where the SUTIME normalization differed from the gold.",
        "Table 3 shows a further breakdown of these errors.",
        "the platinum data set One weakness of SUTIME is that temporal expressions are always resolved with respect to the document creation time (DCT).",
        "While this heuristic works fairly well in most cases, and SUTime can achieve reasonable performance, there are obvious limitations with this approach.",
        "For instance, sometimes it is more appropriate to resolve the temporal expression with respect to nearby dates or events in the text.",
        "As an example, in the test document CNN 20130322 1003 there is the sentence Call me Sunday night at 8 PM at the resort that is part of an email of an unknown date.",
        "In this case, SUTIME still attempts to resolve the temporal expression Sunday night at 8 PM using the document creation time which is incorrect.",
        "There can be inherent ambiguity as to which time point a time expression refers to.",
        "For instance, given a reference date of 2011-09-19, a Monday, it is un",
        "clear whether Friday refers to 2011-09-16 or 2011- 09-23.",
        "SUTIME will normally resolve to the closest date/time with respect to the reference date.",
        "SUTIME also has some rules that will use the verb tense of the surrounding words to attempt to resolve the ambiguity.",
        "For instance, if a verb close to the temporal expression has a POS tag of VBD (past tense verb) then the expression will be resolved so that it occurs before the document date.",
        "Most of the type errors are due to confusions between DATE and DURATION.",
        "Often SUTIME will attempt to resolve a DURATION as a DATE.",
        "For instance, given the phrase ?the following decade?, SUTIME will attempt to resolve that as a DATE with value 202X (using a DCT of 2013-03-22).",
        "While this can be desirable in some cases, this is not what the gold annotation contains: type of DURATION and value of P1DE.",
        "In some other cases, SUTIME misidentifies DURATION as a DATE.",
        "For instance, it lacks rules to parse the 3:07:35 in finishing in 3:07:35 as a duration.",
        "Another problem faced by SUTIME is in figuring out the correct granularity to use.",
        "Given a document date of 2013-03-22, it will identify two years ago as being 2011-03-22.",
        "However, since these expressions indicate a less precise date, the gold annotation is a simple 2011.",
        "SUTIME also provided the wrong normalization for SET in several cases.",
        "For the expression every morning, SUTIME reported a value of TMO when the gold annotation was XXXX-XX-XXTMO.",
        "In other cases, SUTIME offered an alternative normalization, for instance, a value of 19XX for the 20th century instead of just 19.",
        "And PTXM instead of PXM for minutes.",
        "In this case, the PTXM is more correct as the T is required by ISO-8601 to differentiate between M for month, and M for minutes.",
        "The remaining errors are due to lacking rules such as SUTIME's inability to handle time zones in certain cases."

        "As a rule-based system, SUTIME is limited by the coverage of its rule set for the different types of temporal expressions it can recognize.",
        "Many of the errors in SUTIME can be resolved by adding more rules to the system.",
        "One key to improving the normalization of the value is to have better resolution of ambiguous temporal expressions.",
        "Identifying when temporal expressions should not be resolved using the document creation time, and how the temporal expression relates to other temporal expressions or events within the document is also critical.",
        "This suggests that normalization can benefit from being able to perform TempEval-3 Task C well.",
        "Another approach to improving the system would be to provide different modes of use: a mode for end users that would like complex temporal expressions to be identified, or a mode for more basic temporal expressions that can be used as input for other temporal systems.",
        "Allowing for nested TIMEXes would also benefit the system's performance.",
        "For example, 2009-2010 should be a range, with a nested timex for 2009 and 2010.",
        "Another interesting direction to explore would be to evaluate the performance of SUTIME on domains other than current news.",
        "Since SUTIME also supports temporal expressions such as holidays and more distant dates such as 400 B.C., it would be interesting to see how well SUTIME can extract these different types of temporal expressions."
