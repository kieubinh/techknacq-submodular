        "Temporal Evaluations 2013 (TempEval-3) is the third iteration of temporal evaluations (after TempEval-1 (Verhagen et al., 2007) and TempEval2 (Verhagen et al., 2010)) which addresses the task of temporal information processing of text.",
        "In contrast to the previous evaluation campaigns where the temporal relation recognition task was simplified by restricting grammatical context (events in adjacent sentences, events and times in the same sentences) and proposed relation pairs, TempEval-3 does not set any context in which temporal relations have to be identified.",
        "Thus, for temporal relation recognition the challenges consist of: first, detecting a pair of events, or an event and a time that constitutes a temporal relation; and, second, determining what semantic label to assign to the proposed pair.",
        "Moreover, TempEval-3 proposes the task of end-to-end temporal processing in which events and times, their attributes and relations have to be identified from a raw text input.",
        "In this paper we present a data-driven approach to all-around temporal processing of text.",
        "A number of machine-learning detectors were designed to recognize temporal ?markables?",
        "(events and times) and their attributes.",
        "The key feature of our approach is that argument pairs, as well as relations between them, are jointly estimated without specifying in advance the context in which these pairs have to occur."

        "pression normalization subtask we employed a rule-based system which estimates the attribute values for the recognized timexes.",
        "For Task B we proposed a logistic regression classifier which processes input tokens and classifies them as event instances of particular semantic classes.",
        "The optional tense attribute was estimated by a number of manually designed rules.",
        "For the most difficult tasks, Task ABC and Task C, we proposed a dependency parsing technique that jointly learns from data what arguments constitute a temporal relation and what the temporal relation label is.",
        "Due to evaluation time constraints and the time needed to model training, we reduced the set of relation labels and trained the model on two small annotated corpora.",
        "The evaluations evidenced that the use of larger annotated data sets did not improve the timex recognition performance as it was expected from the pre-evaluations.",
        "Interestingly, we did not observe the expected improvement in terms of recall, as it was the case in the pre-evaluations.",
        "Yet, the timex normalization performance levels in the official evaluations were slightly higher than in the pre-evaluations.",
        "In contrast to timex recognition, the use of a large annotated corpus improved the results for event recognition.",
        "The pilot implementation of a temporal parser for newswire articles showed the lowest performance in the evaluations for Task ABC, but still provided decent results for Task C. One of the advantages of the proposed temporal parser is that the parser selects arguments for a temporal relation and classifies it at the same time.",
        "The decision is drawn by a statistical model trained on the annotated data, that is, the parser does not consider any particular predefined grammatical context in which the relation arguments have to be found.",
        "Another weak point of the parser is that it requires a large volume of high-quality annotations and long training times.",
        "The last two facts made it impossible to fully evaluate the proposed temporal parsing model, and we will further investigate the effectiveness of the model."
