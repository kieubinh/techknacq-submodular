        "The Phrasal Semantics task-5b in SemEval 2013 consisted in the discrimination of literal of figurative usage of phrases in context (Korkontzelos et al., 2013).",
        "For instance, the occurrence in a text of the phrase ?a piece of cake?",
        "can be used whether to refer to something that is pretty easy or to an actual piece of cake.",
        "The motivation for this task is that such discrimination could improve the quality and performance of other tasks like machine translation and information retrieval.",
        "This problem has been studied in the past.",
        "Lin (1999) observed that the distributional characteristics of the literal and figurative usage are different.",
        "Katz and Giesbrecht (2006) showed that the similarities among contexts are correlated with their literal or figurative usage.",
        "Birke and Sarkar (2006) clustered literal and figurative contexts using a word-sense-disambiguation approach.",
        "Fazly et al. (2009) showed that literal and figurative usages are related to particular syntactical forms.",
        "Sporleder and Li (2009) showed that for a particular phrase the contexts of its literal usages are more cohesive than those of its figurative usages.",
        "Inspired by these works and in a new observation, we proposed a set or features based on cohesiveness, syntax and stylom-etry (Section 2), which are used to train a machine learning classifier.",
        "The cohesiveness between a phrase an its context can be measured aggregating the relatedness of the context words against the target phrase.",
        "This cohesiveness should be high for phrases used literally.",
        "Conversely, figurative usages can occur in a large variety of contexts implying low cohesiveness.",
        "For instance, the cohesiveness of the phrase ?a piece of cake?",
        "against context words such as ?coffee?, ?birthday?",
        "and ?bakery?",
        "should be high.",
        "The distributional measures used to obtain the needed relatedness scores and the proposed measures of cohesiveness are presented in subsection 2.1.",
        "Moreover, we observed a stylistic trend in the training data set.",
        "That is, figurative usage tends to occur later in the document in comparison with the literal usage.",
        "Consequently, a small set of features that exploits this particular observation is proposed in subsection 2.2.",
        "Fazly et al. (2009) showed that idiomatic phrases composed of a verb and a noun (e.g. ?break a leg?)",
        "differ from their literal usages in the use of some syntactic structures.",
        "For instance, idiomatic phrases are less flexible in the use of determiners, pluraliza",
        "tion and passivization.",
        "In order to capture that notion in a simple way, a set of features form a part-of-speech tagger was included in the feature set (see subsection 2.3).",
        "In Section, additional details of the proposed system are provided jointly with the obtained official results.",
        "Finally, in sections 4 and 5 a brief discussion of the results and some concluding remarks are presented."

        "Another factor that could undermine the results in the ?unseen phrases?",

        "Given that the effectiveness of the cohesiveness features depends",
        "on the number of documents where the idiomatic phrase occurs, the predictions for this test set relied mainly on the less effective features, namely syntactic and stylistic features (see Table 3).",
        "However, this problem could be alleviated obtaining the distributional statistics from a large corpus with enough occurrences of the unseen phrases.",
        "Besides it is important to note, that in spite of the low individual contribution of the stylistic features to the overall accuracy (3.5%), when these are combined with the remaining features they provide an improvement of 12.9% (see Table 3)."
