        "In the cross-language word-sense disambiguation (CL-WSD) task, given an instance of an ambiguous word used in a context, we want to predict the appropriate translation into some target language.",
        "This setting for WSD has an immediate application in machine translation, since many words have multiple possible translations.",
        "Framing the resolution of lexical ambiguities as an explicit classification task has a long history, and was considered in early SMT work at IBM (Brown et al., 1991).",
        "More recently, Carpuat and Wu have shown how to use CL-WSD techniques to improve modern phrase-based SMT systems (Carpuat and Wu, 2007), even though the language model and phrase-tables of these systems mitigate the problem of lexical ambiguities somewhat.",
        "In the SemEval-2013 CL-WSD shared task (Lefever and Hoste, 2013), entrants are asked to build a system that can provide translations for twenty ambiguous English nouns, given appropriate contexts ?",
        "here the particular usage of the ambiguous noun is called the target word.",
        "The five target languages of the shared task are Spanish, Dutch, German, Italian and French.",
        "In the evaluation, for each of the twenty ambiguous nouns, systems are to provide translations for the target word in each of fifty sentences or short passages.",
        "The translations of each English word may be single words or short phrases in the target language, but in either case, they should be lemmatized.",
        "Following the work of Lefever and Hoste (2011), we wanted to make use of multiple bitext corpora for the CL-WSD task.",
        "ParaSense, the system of Lefever and Hoste, takes into account evidence from all of the available parallel corpora.",
        "Let S be the set of five target languages and t be the particular target language of interest at the moment; ParaSense creates bag-of-words features from the translations of the target sentence into the languages S?{t}.",
        "Given corpora that are parallel over many languages, this is straightforward at training time.",
        "However, at testing time it requires a complete MT system for each of the four other languages, which is computationally prohibitive.",
        "Thus in our work, we learn from several parallel corpora but require neither a locally running MT system nor access to an online translation API.",
        "We presented three systems in this shared task, all of which were variations on the theme of a maximum entropy classifier for each ambiguous noun, trained on local context features similar to those used in previous work and familiar from the WSD literature.",

        "The second system, L2 (?layer two?",
        "), is the same as the L1 system, with the addition of the correct translations into the other target languages as features, which at testing time are predicted with L1 classifiers.",
        "The third system, MRF (?Markov random field?)",
        "uses a network of interacting classifiers to solve the classification problem for all five target languages jointly.",
        "Our three systems are all trained from the same data, which we extracted from the Europarl Intersection corpus provided by the shared task organizers.",
        "At the time of the evaluation, our simplest system had the top results in the shared task for the out-of-five evaluation for three languages (Spanish, German, and Italian).",
        "However, after the evaluation deadline, we fixed a simple bug in our MRF code, and the MRF system then achieved even better results for the oof evaluation.",
        "For the best evaluation, our two more sophisticated systems posted better results than the L1 version.",
        "All of our systems beat the ?most-frequent sense?",

        "Having extracted the relevant training sentences from the aligned bitext for each of the five language pairs, we created training instances with local context features commonly used in WSD systems.",

        "of L1 classifiers in an effort to find the best translation into all five target languages jointly.",

        "Thus the task of finding the optimal translations into five languages jointly is framed as a MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) inference problem, where we try to maximize the joint probability P (wfr, wes, wit, wde, wnl), given the evidence of the features extracted from the source-language sentence.",
        "The inference process is performed using loopy belief propagation (Murphy et al., 1999), which is an approximate but tractable inference algorithm that, while it gives no guarantees, often produces good solutions in practice.",
        "The intuition behind using a Markov network for this task is that, since we must make five decisions for each source-language sentence, we should make use of the correlations between the target-language words.",
        "Correlations might occur in practice due to cognates ?",
        "the languages in the shared task are fairly closely related ?",
        "or they may simply reflect ambiguities in the source language that are resolved in two target languages.",
        "So by building a Markov network in which all of the classifiers can communicate (see Figure 2), we allow nodes to influence the translation decisions of their neighbors, but only proportionally to the correlation between the translations that we observe in the two languages.",
        "We frame the MAP inference task as a minimization problem; we want to find an assignment that minimizes the sum of all of our penalty functions, which we will describe next.",
        "First, we have a unary function from each of the five L1 classifiers, which correspond to nodes in the network.",
        "These functions each assign a penalty to each possible label for the target word in the corresponding language; that penalty is simply the negative log of the probability of the label, as estimated by the classifier.",
        "Formally, a unary potential ?i, for some fixed set of features f and a particular language i, is a function from a label l to some positive penalty value.",

        "These joint probabilities are estimated from the training data; we count the number of times each pair of labels li and lj co-occurs in the train",

        "functions.",
        "As mentioned earlier, we do this via loopy belief propagation, using the formulation for pairwise Markov networks that passes messages directly between the nodes rather than first constructing a cluster graph (Koller and Friedman, 2009, ?11.3.5.1).",
        "As we are trying to compute the minimum-penalty assignment to the five variables, we use the min-sum version of loopy belief propagation.",
        "The messages are mappings from the possible values that the recipient node could take to penalty values.",
        "At each time step, every node passes to each of its neighbors a message of the following form:",
        "By this expression, we mean that the message from node i to node j at time t is a function from possible labels for node j to scalar penalty values.",
        "Each penalty value is determined by minimizing over the possible labels for node i, such that we find the label li that minimizes sum of the unary cost for that label, the binary cost for li and lj taken jointly, and all of the penalties in the messages that node i received at the previous time step, except for the one from node j.",
        "Intuitively, these messages inform a given neigh-bor about the estimate, from the perspective of the sending node and what it has heard from its other neighbors, of the minimum penalty that would be incurred if the recipient node were to take a given label.",
        "As a concrete example, when the nl node sends a message to the fr node at time step 10, this message is a table mapping from all possible French translations of the current target word to their associated penalty values.",
        "The message depends on three things: the function ?nl (itself dependent on the probability distribution output by the L1 classifier), the binary potential function ?",
        "(nl,fr), and the messages from es, it and de from time step 9.",
        "Note that the binary potential functions are symmetric because they are derived from joint probabilities.",
        "Loopy belief propagation is an approximate inference algorithm, and it is neither guaranteed to find a globally optimal solution, nor even to converge at all, but it does often find good solutions in practice.",
        "We run it for twenty iterations, which empirically works well.",
        "After the message-passing iterations, each node chooses the value that minimizes the sum of the penalties from messages and from its own unary potential function.",
        "To avoid accumulating very large penalties, we normalize the outgoing messages at each time step and give a larger weight to the unary potential functions.",
        "These normalization and weighting parameters were set by hand, but seem to work well in practice."

        "The systems that took into account evidence from multiple sources had better performance than the one using monolingual features: our top result in every language came from either the L2 or the MRF classifier for both evaluations.",
        "This suggests that it is possible to make use of the evidence in several parallel corpora in a CL-WSD task without translating every word in a source sentence into many target languages.",
        "We expect that the L2 classifier could be improved by adding features derived from more classifiers and making use of information from many disparate sources.",
        "We would like to try adding classifiers trained on the other Europarl languages, as well as completely different corpora.",
        "The L2 classifier approach only requires that the first-layer classifiers make some prediction based on text in the source language.",
        "They need not be trained from the same source text, depend on the same features, or even output words as labels.",
        "In future work we will explore all of these variations.",
        "One could, for example, train a monolingual WSD system on a sense-tagged corpus and use this as an additional information source for an L2 classifier.",
        "There remain a number of avenues that we would like to explore for the MRF system; thus far, we have used the joint probability of two labels to set the binary potentials.",
        "We would like to investigate other functions, especially ones that do not incur large penalties for rare labels, as the joint probability of two labels that often co-occur but are both rare will be low.",
        "Also, in the current system, the relative weights of the binary potentials and the unary potentials were set by hand, with a very small amount of empirical tuning.",
        "We could, in the future, tune the",
        "weights with a more principled optimization strategy, using a development set.",
        "As with the L2 classifiers, it would be helpful in the future for the MRF system to not require many mutually parallel corpora for training ?",
        "however, the current approach for estimating the edge potentials requires the use of bitext for each edge in the network.",
        "Perhaps these correlations could be estimated in a semi-supervised way, with high-confidence automatic labels being used to estimate the joint distribution over target-language phrases.",
        "We would also like to investigate approaches to jointly disambiguate many words in the same sentence, since lexical ambiguity is not just a problem for a few nouns.",
        "Aside from improvements to the design of our CL-WSD system itself, we want to use it in a practical system for translating into under-resourced languages.",
        "We are now working on integrating this project with our rule-based MT system, L3 (Gasser, 2012).",
        "We had experimented with a similar, though less sophisticated, CL-WSD system for Quechua (Rudnick, 2011), but in the future, L3 with the integrated CL-WSD system should be capable of translating Spanish to Guarani, either as a standalone system, or as part of a computer-assisted translation tool."
