        "Two different types of systems were submitted under Task 11 of SemEval - 2013 (Roberto Navigli and Daniele Vannella, 2013).",
        "The two system types are WSI (Word Sense Induction) and WSD (Word Sense Disambiguation).",
        "WSD is the task of automatically associating meaning with words.",
        "In WSD the possible meanings for a given word are drawn from an existing sense inventory.",
        "In contrast, WSI aims at automatically identifying the meanings of a given word from raw text.",
        "A WSI system will be asked to identify the meaning of the input query and cluster the search results into semantically-related groups according to their meanings.",
        "Instead, a WSD system will be requested to sense-tag the above search results with the appropriate senses of the input query and this, again, will implicitly determine a clustering of snippets (i.e., one cluster per sense).",

        "Our system implements the idea given in (Jin-grui He and Hanghang Tong and Qiaozhu Mei and Boleslaw Szymanski, 2012).",
        "This developed system uses the concept of submodularity.",
        "The task is treated as a submodular function maximization which has its benefits.",
        "On the one hand, there exists a simple greedy algorithm for monotone submodular function maximization where the solution obtained is guaranteed to be almost as good as the best possible solution according to an objective.",
        "More precisely, the greedy algorithm is a constant factor approximation to the cardinality constrained version of the problem, so that the approximate soultion is in the bound of (1 ?",
        "1/e) of optimal solution.",
        "It is also important to note that this is a worst case bound, and in most cases the quality of the solution obtained will be much better than this bound suggests.",
        "In our system, monotone submodular objective of (Jingrui He and Hanghang Tong and Qiaozhu Mei and Boleslaw Szymanski, 2012) was implemented to find the top k simultaneously relevant and diversified list of search results.",
        "Once these top k results are obtained, they are used as centroids to form clusters by classifying each of remaining search results to one of the centroid with maximum similarity, producing k clusters.",
        "Those results which are not similar to any of the centroids are either put in a different cluster or are assigned to cluster with highest similarity."

        "It favours relevant search results from big clusters.",
        "In other words, if two search results are equally relevant to the query, one from a big cluster and the other isolated, by using weighted relevance, it prefers the former.",
        "The second term measures the similarity among the search results within T such that it penalizes the selection of multiple relevant search results that are very similar to each other.",

        "The cluster ranking is kept same as the rank of their centroids in top 10 results returned in first stage of the system.",
