        "Therefore, we performed a second analysis that partitioned the test set into two sets: those labeled with a single sense and those with multiple senses.",

        "This performance suggests that WSI systems using graded labels provide a way to leverage huge amounts of unannotated corpus data for finding sense-related features in order to train semi-supervised WSD systems.",
