        "In recent years, sentiment analysis in social media has attracted a lot of research interest and has been used for a number of applications.",
        "Unfortunately, research has been hindered by the lack of suitable datasets, complicating the comparison between approaches.",
        "To address this issue, we have proposed SemEval-2013 Task 2: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter, which included two subtasks: A, an expression-level subtask, and B, a message-level subtask.",
        "We used crowdsourcing on Amazon Mechanical Turk to label a large Twitter training dataset alng with additional test sets of Twitter and SMS messages for both subtasks.",
        "All datasets used in the evaluation are released to the research community.",
        "The task attracted significant interest and a total of 149 submissions from 44 teams.",
        "The best-performing team achieved an F1 of 88.9% and 69% for subtasks A and B, respectively."

        "In the past decade, new forms of communication, such as microblogging and text messaging have emerged and become ubiquitous.",
        "Twitter messages (tweets) and cell phone messages (SMS) are often used to share opinions and sentiments about the surrounding world, and the availability of social content generated on sites such as Twitter creates new opportunities to automatically study public opinion.",
        "Working with these informal text genres presents new challenges for natural language processing beyond those encountered when working with more traditional text genres such as newswire.",
        "Tweets and SMS messages are short in length: a sentence or a headline rather than a document.",
        "The language they use is very informal, with creative spelling and punctuation, misspellings, slang, new words, URLs, and genre-specific terminology and abbreviations, e.g., RT for re-tweet and #hashtags.1 How to handle such challenges so as to automatically mine and understand the opinions and sentiments that people are communicating has only very recently been the subject of research (Jansen et al., 2009; Barbosa and Feng, 2010; Bifet et al., 2011; Davidov et al., 2010; O?Connor et al., 2010; Pak and Paroubek, 2010; Tumasjan et al., 2010; Kouloumpis et al., 2011).",
        "Another aspect of social media data, such as Twitter messages, is that they include rich structured information about the individuals involved in the communication.",
        "For example, Twitter maintains information about who follows whom.",
        "Re-tweets (re-shares of a tweet) and tags inside of tweets provide discourse information.",
        "Modeling such structured information is important because it provides means for empirically studying social interactions where opinion is conveyed, e.g., we can study the properties of persuasive language or those associated with influential users.",
        "Several corpora with detailed opinion and sentiment annotation have been made freely available, e.g., the MPQA corpus (Wiebe et al., 2005) of newswire text.",
        "These corpora have proved very valuable as resources for learning about the language of sentiment in general, but they did not focus on social media.",
        "While some Twitter sentiment datasets have already been created, they were either small and proprietary, such as the i-sieve corpus (Kouloumpis et al., 2011), or they were created only for Spanish like the TASS corpus2 (Villena-Roma?n et al., 2013), or they relied on noisy labels obtained from emoticons and hashtags.",
        "They further focused on message-level sentiment, and no Twitter or SMS corpus with expression-level sentiment annotations has been made available so far.",
        "Thus, the primary goal of our SemEval-2013 task 2 has been to promote research that will lead to a better understanding of how sentiment is conveyed in Tweets and SMS messages.",
        "Toward that goal, we created the SemEval Tweet corpus, which contains Tweets (for both training and testing) and SMS messages (for testing only) with sentiment expressions annotated with contextual phrase-level polarity as well as an overall message-level polarity.",
        "We used this corpus as a testbed for the system evaluation at SemEval-2013 Task 2.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, we first describe the task, the dataset creation process, and the evaluation methodology.",
        "We then summarize the characteristics of the approaches taken by the participating systems and we discuss their scores."

        "Participants could choose to participate in either or both subtasks.",
        "Below we provide short descriptions of the objectives of these two subtasks.",
        "Subtask A: Contextual Polarity Disambiguation Given a message containing a marked instance of a word or a phrase, determine whether that instance is positive, negative or neutral in that context.",
        "The boundaries for the marked instance were provided: this was a classification task, not an entity recognition task.",
        "Given a message, decide whether it is of positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.",
        "For messages conveying both a positive and a negative sentiment, whichever is the stronger one was to be chosen.",
        "Each participating team was allowed to submit results for two different systems per subtask: one constrained, and one unconstrained.",
        "A constrained system could only use the provided data for training, but it could also use other resources such as lexicons obtained elsewhere.",
        "An unconstrained system could use any additional data as part of the training process; this could be done in a supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised fashion.",
        "Note that constrained/unconstrained refers to the data used to train a classifier.",
        "For example, if other data (excluding the test data) was used to develop a sentiment lexicon, and the lexicon was used to generate features, the system would still be constrained.",
        "However, if other data (excluding the test data) was used to develop a sentiment lexicon, and this lexicon was used to automatically label additional Tweet/SMS messages and then used with the original data to train the classifier, then such a system would be unconstrained."

        "We then identified popular topics as those named entities that are frequently mentioned in association with a specific date (Ritter et al., 2012).",
        "Given this set of automatically identified topics, we gathered tweets from the same time period which mentioned the named entities.",
        "The testing messages had different topics from training and spanned later periods.",
        "To identify messages that express sentiment towards these topics, we filtered the tweets using SentiWordNet (Baccianella et al., 2010).",
        "We removed messages that contained no sentiment-bearing words, keeping only those with at least one word with positive or negative sentiment score that is greater than 0.3 in SentiWordNet for at least one sense of the words.",
        "Without filtering, we found class imbalance to be too high.3 Twitter messages are rich in social media features, including out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, emoticons, and acronyms; see Table 1.",
        "A large portion of the OOV words are hashtags (e.g., #sheenroast) and mentions (e.g., @tash jade).",
        "3Filtering based on an existing lexicon does bias the dataset to some degree; however, note that the text still contains sentiment expressions outside those in the lexicon.",
        "We annotated the same Twitter messages with annotations for subtask A and subtask B.",
        "However, the final training and testing datasets overlap only partially between the two subtasks since we had to throw away messages with low inter-annotator agreement, and this differed between the subtasks.",
