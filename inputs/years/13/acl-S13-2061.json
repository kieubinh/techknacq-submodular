        "Natural language processing (NLP) is a research area comprising various tasks; one of which is sentiment analysis.",
        "The main goal of sentiment analysis is to identify the polarity of natural language text (Shaikh et al., 2007).",
        "Sentiment analysis can be referred to as opinion mining, as study peoples?",
        "opinions, appraisals and emotions towards entities and events and their attributes (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "Sentiment analysis has become a popular research area in NLP with the purpose of identifying opinions or attitudes in terms of polarity.",
        "This paper presents TJP, a system submitted to SemEval 2013 for Task 2 part A: Contextual Polarity Disambiguation (Wilson et al., 2013).",
        "TJP was focused on the ?constrained?",
        "task, which used only training and development data provided.",
        "This avoided both resource implications and potential advantages implied by the use of additional data containing sentiment annotations.",
        "The objective was to explore the relative success of a simple approach that could be implemented easily with open-source software.",
        "The TJP system was implemented using the Python Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK, Bird et al., 2009).",
        "We considered several basic approaches.",
        "These used a preprocessing phase to expand contractions, eliminate stopwords, and identify emoticons.",
        "The next phase used supervised machine learning and n-gram features.",
        "Although we had two approaches that both used n-gram features, we were limited to submitting just one result.",
        "Consequently, we chose to submit a unigram based approach followed by naive Bayes since this performed better on the data.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: section 2 provides some discussion on the related work.",
        "The methodology of corpus collection and data classification are provided in section 3.",
        "Section 4 outlines details of the experiment and results, followed by the conclusion and ideas for future work in section 5."

        "Go et al. (2009) used distant supervision to classify sentiment of Twitter, as similar as in (Read, 2005).",
        "Emoticons have been used as noisy labels in training data to perform distant supervised learning (positive and negative).",
        "Three classifiers were used: Na?ve Bayes, Maximum Entropy and Support Vector Machine, and they were able to obtain more than 80% accuracy on their testing data.",

        "Their task focused on analyzing the contents of social media by using n-gram graphs, and the results showed that n-gram yielded high accuracy when tested with C4.5, but low accuracy with Na?ve Bayes Multinomial (NBM)."
