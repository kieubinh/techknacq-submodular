        "The past years have witnessed the emergence and popularity of short messages such as tweets and SMS messages.",
        "Comparing with the traditional genres such as newswire data, tweets are very short and use informal grammar and expressions.",
        "The shortness and informality make them a new genre and bring new challenges to sentiment analysis (Pang et al., 2002) as well as other NLP applications such named entity recognition (Habib et al., 2013).",
        "Recently a wide range of methods and features have been applied to sentimental analysis over tweets.",
        "Go et al. (2009) train sentiment classifiers using machine learning methods, such as Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy and SVMs, with different combinations of features such as unigrams, bigrams and Part-of-Speech (POS) tags.",
        "Microblogging features such as hashtags, emoticons, abbreviations, all-caps and character repetitions are also found helpful (Kouloumpis et al., 2011).",
        "Saif et al. (2012) train Naive Bayes models with semantic features.",
        "Also the lexicon prior polarities have been proved very useful (Agarwal et al., 2011).",
        "Davidov et al. (2010) utilize hashtags and smileys to build a large-scale annotated tweet dataset automatically.",
        "This avoids the need for labour intensive manual annotation.",
        "Due to the fact that tweets are generated constantly, sentiment analysis over tweets has some interesting applications, such as predicting stock market movement (Bollen et al., 2011) and predicting election results (Tumasjan et al., 2010; O?Connor et al., 2010).",
        "But there are still some unclear parts in the literature.",
        "For example, it is unclear whether using POS tags improves the sentiment analysis performance or not.",
        "Conflicting results are reported (Pak and Paroubek, 2010; Go et al., 2009).",
        "It is also a little surprising that not removing stopwords increases performance (Saif et al., 2012).",
        "In this paper, we build a system based on the concept of co-occurrence rate.",
        "9 different types of features are considered.",
        "We find that using a subset of these features achieves the best results in our system, so we use this subset of features rather than all the 9 types of features in our submitted system.",
        "To see the contribution of each type of features, we perform experiments by leaving one type of features out each time.",
        "Results show that unigrams are the most important",
        "features, bigrams and POS tags seem not helpful, and retaining stopwords makes the results better.",
