        "This paper describes a dual-classifier approach to contextual sentiment analysis at the SemEval-2013 Task 2.",
        "Contextual analysis of polarity focuses on a word or phrase, rather than the broader task of identifying the sentiment of an entire text.",
        "The Task 2 definition includes target word spans that range in size from a single word to entire sentences.",
        "However, the context of a single word is dependent on the word's surrounding syntax, while a phrase contains most of the polarity within itself.",
        "We thus describe separate treatment with two independent classifiers, outperforming the accuracy of a single classifier.",
        "Our system ranked 6th out of 19 teams on SMS message classification, and 8th of 23 on twitter data.",
        "We also show a surprising result that a very small amount of word context is needed for high-performance polarity extraction."

        "A variety of approaches to sentiment analysis have been proposed in the literature.",
        "Early work sought to identify the general sentiment of entire documents, but a recent shift to social media has provided a large quantity of publicly available data, and private organizations are increasingly interested in how a population ?feels?",
        "toward its products.",
        "Identifying the polarity of language toward a particular topic, however, no longer requires identifying the sentiment of an entire text, but rather the contextual sentiment surrounding a target phrase.",
        "Identifying the polarity of text toward a phrase is significantly different from a sentence's overall polarity, as seen in this example from the SemEval2013 Task 2 (Wilson et al., 2013) training set: I had a severe nosebleed last night.",
        "I think my iPad caused it as I was browsing for a few hours on it.",
        "Anyhow, its stopped, which is good.",
        "An ideal sentiment classifier would classify this text as overall positive (the nosebleed stopped!",
        "), but this short snippet actually contains three types of polarity (positive, negative, and neutral).",
        "The middle sentence about the iPad is not positive, but neutral.",
        "The word ?nosebleed?",
        "has a very negative polarity in this context, and the phrase ?its stopped?",
        "is positive.",
        "Someone interested in specific health concerns, such as nosebleeds, needs a contextual classifier to identify the desired polarity in this context.",
        "This example also illustrates how phrases of different sizes require unique handling.",
        "Single token phrases, such as ?nosebleed?, are highly dependent on the surrounding context for its polarity.",
        "However, the polarity of the middle iPad sentence is contained within the phrase itself.",
        "The surrounding context is not as important.",
        "This paper thus proposes a dual-classifier that trains two separate classifiers, one for single words, and another for phrases.",
        "We empirically show that unique features apply to both, and both benefit from independent training.",
        "In fact, we show a surprising result that a very small window size is needed for the context of single word phrases.",
        "Our system performs well on the SemEval task, placing 8th of 23 systems on twitter text.",
        "It also shows strong generalization to SMS text messages, placing 6th of 19."

        "Microblogs serve as a quick way to measure a large population's mood and opinion.",

        "Specific work on microblogs has focused on finding noisy training data with distant supervision.",
        "Many of these algorithms use emoticons as semantic indicators of polarity.",
        "For instance, a tweet that contains a sad face likely contains a negative polarity (Read, 2005; Go et al., 2009; Bifet and Frank, 2010; Pak and Paroubek, 2010; Davidov et al., 2010; Kouloumpis et al., 2011).",
        "In a similar vein, hash-tags can also serve as noisy labels (Davidov et al., 2010; Kouloumpis et al., 2011).",
        "Most work on distant supervision relies on a variety of syntactic and word-based features (Marchetti-Bowick and Chambers, 2012).",
        "We adopt many of these features.",
        "Supervised learning for contextual sentiment analysis has not been thoroughly investigated.",
        "La-beled data for specific words or queries is expensive to generate, so Jiang et al. (2011) is one of the few approaches with labeled training data.",
        "Earlier work on product reviews sought the sentiment toward particular product features.",
        "These systems used rule based approaches based on parts of speech and other surface features (Nasukawa and Yi, 2003; Hu and Liu, 2004; Ding and Liu, 2007).",
        "Finally, topic identification in microblogs is also related.",
        "The first approaches are somewhat simple, selecting single keywords (e.g., ?Obama?)",
        "to represent the topic (e.g., ?US President?",
        "), and retrieve tweets that contain the word (O?Connor et al., 2010; Tumasjan et al., 2010; Tan et al., 2011).",
        "These systems then classify the polarity of the entire tweet, and ignore the question of polarity toward the particular topic.",
