        "The analysis of the emotional content of text, is relevant to numerous natural language processing (NLP), web and multi-modal dialogue applications.",
        "To that end there has been a significant scientific effort towards tasks like product review analysis (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Hu and Liu, 2004), speech emotion extraction (Lee and Narayanan, 2005; Lee et al., 2002; Ang et al., 2002) and pure text word (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Strappar-ava and Valitutti, 2004) and sentence (Turney and Littman, 2002; Turney and Littman, 2003) level emotion extraction.",
        "The rise of social media in recent years has seen a shift in research focus towards them, particularly twitter.",
        "The large volume of text data available is particularly useful, since it allows the use of complex machine learning methods.",
        "Also important is the interest on the part of companies that are actively looking for ways to mine social media for opinions and attitudes towards them and their products.",
        "Similarly, in journalism there is interest in sentiment analysis for a way to process and report on the public opinion about current events (Petulla, 2013).",
        "Analyzing emotion expressed in twitter borrows from other tasks related to affective analysis, but also presents unique challenges.",
        "One common issue is the breadth of content available in twitter: a more limited domain would make the task easier, however there are no such bounds.",
        "There is also a significant difference in the form of language used in tweets.",
        "The tone is informal and typographical and grammatical errors are very common, making even simple tasks, like Part-of-Speech tagging much harder.",
        "Features like hashtags and emoticons can also be helpful (Davidov et al., 2010).",
        "This paper describes our submissions for SemEval 2013 task 2, subtask B, which deals primarily with sentiment analysis in twitter.",
        "For the constrained condition (using only the organizer-provided twitter sentences) we implemented a system based on the use of an affective lexicon and part-of-speech tag information, which has been shown relevant to the task (Pak and Paroubek, 2010).",
        "For the unconstrained condition (including external sources of twitter sentences) we combine the constrained model with a maximum entropy language",
        "model trained on external data."

        "The method used for the constrained condition is based on an affective lexicon containing out-of-context affective ratings for all terms contained in each sentence.",

        "We assume that the continuous (in [?1, 1]) valence and arousal ratings of any term can be represented as a linear combination of its semantic similarities to a set of seed words and the affective ratings of these words, as follows:",
        "where wj is the term we mean to characterize, w1...wN are the seed words, v(wi) is the valence rating for seed word wi, ai is the weight corresponding to seed word wi (that is estimated as described next), dij is a measure of semantic similarity between wi and wj .",
        "For the purposes of this work, the semantic similarity metric is the cosine similarity between context vectors computed over a corpus of 116 million web snippets collected by posing one query for every word in the Aspell spellchecker's vocabulary to the Yahoo!",
        "search engine and collecting up to 500 of the top results.",
        "Given a starting, manually annotated, lexicon we can select part of it to serve as seed words and then use 1 to create a system of linear equations where the only unknowns are the weights ai.",
        "The system is solved using Least Squares Estimation.",
        "That provides us with an equation that can generate affective ratings for every term (not limited to words), as long as we can estimate the semantic similarity between it and the seed words.",
        "Seed word selection is performed by a simple heuristic (though validated through experiments): we want seed words to have extreme affective ratings (maximum absolute value) and we want the set to be as closed to balanced as possible (sum of seed ratings equal to zero).",
        "Given these term ratings, the next step is combining them through statistics.",
        "To do that we use simple statistics (mean, min, max) and group by part of speech tags.",
        "The results are statistics like ?maximum valence among adjectives?, ?mean arousal among proper nouns?",
        "and ?number of verbs and nouns?.",
        "The dimensions used are: valence, absolute valence and arousal.",
        "The grouping factors are the 39 Penn treebank pos tags plus higher order tags (adjectives, verbs, nouns, adverbs and combinations of 2,3 and 4 of them).",
        "The statistics extracted are: mean, min, max, most extreme, sum, number, percentage of sentence coverage.",
        "In the case of bigram terms no part-of-speech filtering/grouping is applied.",
        "These statistics form the feature vectors.",
        "Finally we perform feature selection on the massive set of candidates and use them to train a model.",
        "The model selected is a Naive Bayes tree, a tree with Naive Bayes classifiers on each leaf.",
        "The motivation comes by considering this a two stage problem: subjectivity detection and polarity classification, making a hierarchical model a natural choice.",
