        "Using labeled Twitter training data from SemEval-2013, we train both a subjectivity classifier and a polarity classifier separately, and then combine the two into a single hierarchical classifier.",
        "Using additional unlabeled data that is believed to contain sentiment, we allow the polarity classifier to continue learning using self-training.",
        "The resulting system is capable of classifying a document as neutral, positive, or negative with an overall accuracy of 61.2% using our hierarchical Naive Bayes classifier."

        "Many people use social networks, such as Twitter, to connect and communicate with others.",
        "Users of social networks often share their experiences, such as watching a recent movie or tv show, reading a book, or a newly tried product or service.",
        "In addition, social networks provide an avenue for discussion of current events, such as politics.",
        "Many people and companies are often concerned with how others perceive their product?which is sometimes themselves, as is the case for politicians?or their service.",
        "By understanding and reacting to what the consumer is thinking, they can attempt to maximize their good press as well as to help minimize the bad.",
        "It would therefore be useful to use the information users of social networks share to perform sentiment analysis in order to understand how people perceive targets of interest.",
        "In general, sentiment analysis often involves the use of machine learning, especially Naive Bayes, SVM, and MaxEnt classifiers [Jose].",
        "Features general include n-grams and POS tags [Go et al., 2009; Pak and Paroubek, 2010; Jose], as well as sentiment lexicons [Jose].",
        "Go et al. [2009] achieved around 82.5% accuracy for positive-negative polarity detection, Jose achieved around 76% accuracy for subjective-objective classification, and Pak and Paroubek [2010] achieved around 70% accuracy for a combined subjectivity-polarity classifier.",
        "While determining whether a document known to be subjective is positive or negative (polarity detection) is relatively easy, a currently more difficult task in sentiment analysis is identifying whether a document is subjective or objective (subjectivity analysis).",
        "Many approaches simply ignore the objective class [Go et al., 2009], which does not work for real world problems as there are a substantial amount of documents that are either partially or wholly objective [Koppel and Schler, 2006].",
        "Many previous methods focus on either subjectivity analysis or polarity detection.",
        "Our method incorporates both subtasks into a single overall system in order to perform sentiment analysis."

        "The sentiment analysis in Twitter task of SemEval2013 [Wilson et al., 2013] provides 9,864 labeled tweets from Twitter to be used as a training dataset.",
        "Each instance is labeled as either positive, negative, or neutral, and was annotated through Amazon's Mechanical Turk.",
        "The terms of service for Twitter puts restrictions on the",
        "type of data that may be re-released, therefore participants SemEval-2013 Task 2 participants were required to download tweets directly from Twitter.",
        "Due to deleted or otherwise unavailable tweets, this system was only able to download approximately 8,750 training instances.",
        "Additionally, a development dataset was provided with 1,654 labeled tweets, of which 340 are negative, 739 are neutral, and 575 are positive.",
        "The provided test set consisted of 3,813 instances, of which 601 are negative, 1640 are neutral, and 1572 are positive.",
        "In related work, Go et al. [2009] generated an automatically labeled noisy gold standard by searching for tweets that contained one of several emoticons2 (e.g. :) or :() that were mapped to either the positive or negative class depending on the type of emoticon in the text.",
        "This system also collected approximately one million tweets using emoticons as a keyword search for matching, however the data remained unlabeled.",
        "Though these tweets are unlabeled, they are presumed to be subjective?either positive or negative but not neutral?because of the intuitive association of emoticons with sentiment."
