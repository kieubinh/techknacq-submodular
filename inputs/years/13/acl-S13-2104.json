        "In this case we focus on the pharmacological domain.",
        "Furthermore, some initiatives have promoted the evaluation of different systems of named entity recognition and relation extraction in the pharmacological domain.",
        "This is the case of Semeval 2013: Recognition and classification of drug names task1 (Segura-Bedmar et al., 2013), where the system presented in this communication has been evaluated.",
        "Following the annotation guidelines of the task, a drug is a substance that is used in the treatment, cure, prevention or diagnosis of disease.",
        "Moreover, each drug name entity can be classified in four different types: drug, brand, drug_n and group.",
        "Our system uses biomedical ontologies and external resources (containing biomedical information) as input to determine whether we are treating a drug name entity or not.",
        "The resource integration seems to represent an improvement since the knowledge available for identifying entities is higher.",

        "The field of NER has been very studied in recent years, and has been faced in many approaches.",
        "Since text structures are frequently used to characterize documents in text mining algorithms, there only stand out those based in terms and",
        "concepts.",
        "This is due to that concept-based systems represent the semantic content with a smaller number of characteristics, opposite to the term-based systems based on characters or words.",
        "Concept-based and term-based representations mainly differ in the implicit or explicit appearance, respectively, of the words identified in the document.",
        "This fact implies that concept-based extraction techniques are more complex, requiring the use of more advanced computational linguistics techniques and a greater dependence on knowledge domain.",
        "One reference system that focuses on concept recognition in the biomedical domain is MetaMap (Aronson, 2001).",
        "MetaMap is a program developed by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) that uses the UMLS Metathesaurus for annotating the concepts in a given text.",
        "The program is designed to obtain the concept that best fits a particular phrase, finding its origin in an attempt to improve the retrieval of biomedical literature indexed in MEDLINE/PubMed.",
        "MetaMap is a program with many strengths, such as the power of linguistic analysis, the high performance setting possibilities and the variety of processing algorithms included.",
        "On the other hand, MetaMap shows some weaknesses such as the algorithms developing focused on English grammar texts, or high processing time lapse due to the complexity of the algorithms (not suitable for real-time systems).",
        "Metamap analysis time periods goes from less than a minute for short simple text to long hours for complex sentences.",
        "Gimli (Campos et al., 2013) is an open source and high-performance solution for biomedical named entity recognition on scientific documents, supporting the automatic recognition of gene, proteins, DNA, RNA, and cell domain names.",
        "This tool implements a machine learning approach based on conditional random fields (CRF).",
        "On the other hand, there exists a more recent concept extraction techniques based on ontologies.",
        "Ontologies link concept labels to their interpretations, ie specifications of their meanings including concept definitions and relations to other concepts.",
        "Apart from relations such as isa and part-of, generally present in almost any domain, ontologies also model domain-specific relations, eg clinically-associated-with and has-manifestation are specific associations for the biomedical domain.",
        "Therefore, ontologies reflect the structure of the domain and constrain the potential interpretations of terms.",
        "Thus, ontologies can provide rich concept knowledge of domain specific name entities.",
        "This is the case of Open Biomedical Annotator (OBA) (Jonquet et al., 2009), an impressive annotation system using ontologies, which provides online access for users and for other systems as a Web service.",
        "There are other examples of utilities for extracting concepts using ontologies (e.g. Terminizer (Hancock et al., 2009), Whatizit (Rebholz-Schuhmann et al., 2008) or Reflect (Pafilis et al., 2009)).",
        "However, the magnitude of ontologies and resources integrated under the OBA Web service is difficult to reach by other systems (Whetzel et al., 2011): in three years",
        "(from 2008 to 2011), they have increased from 72 to 260 biomedical ontologies.",
        "The concept recognition tool used by the OBA system in order to find ontology concepts matching the terms extracted from texts-is called Mgrep.",
        "Although Mgrep is not a free tool, some results are presented in (Jonquet et al., 2008).",
        "A comparison between Mgrep and MetaMap can also be found in (Shah et al., 2009), where they make an evaluation over a biological and disease terms dictionaries with precision (0.87 to 0.71 respectively) and recall (1548 to 1730 recovered terms respectively) metrics.",
