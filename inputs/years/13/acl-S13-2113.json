        "Word Sense Induction (WSI) is the task of automatically discovering word senses from text.",
        "In principle, WSI avoids reliance on a predefined sense inventory.1 Whereas the related task of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) can only assign predefined senses to words on the basis of context, WSI follows the dictum that ?The meaning of a word is its use in the language.?",

        "WSI, therefore, may be applied",
        "a gold standard sense inventory such as WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) or OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006).",
        "to discover new, rare, or domain specific senses; senses undefined in existing sense inventories.2 Previous WSI evaluations (Agirre and Soroa, 2007; Manandhar et al., 2010) have approached sense induction in terms of finding the single most salient sense of a target word given its context.",
        "However, as shown in Erk and McCarthy (2009), a graded notion of sense may be more applicable, as multiple senses of the target word may be perceived by readers.",
        "The SemEval-2013 WSI evaluation described in this paper is designed to explore the possibility of finding all perceived senses of a target word in a single contextual instance.",
        "The aim for participants in the task is therefore to design a system that will induce a set of graded (weighted) senses of a target word in a particular context.",
        "The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 introduces SemEval-2013 Task 13: Word Sense Induction for Graded and Non-Graded Senses; Section 3 presents UoS, the system that participated in the task; Section 4 reports evaluation results, showing that UoS returns scores comparable with those of the best performing systems."
