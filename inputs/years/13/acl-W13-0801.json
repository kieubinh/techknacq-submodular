        "Much research has focused on automatically evaluating the quality of Machine Translation (MT) by comparing automatic translations to human translations on samples of a few thousand sentences.",
        "Many metrics (Papineni et al., 2002; Banerjee and Lavie, 2005; Gime?nez and Ma?rquez, 2007; Lo and Wu, 2011, for instance) have been proposed to estimate the adequacy and fluency of machine translation and evaluated based on their correlatation with human judgements of translation quality (Callison-Burch et al., 2010).",
        "While these metrics have proven invaluable in driving progress in MT research, finer-grained evaluations of translation quality are necessary to provide a more focused analysis of translation errors.",
        "When developing complex MT systems, comparing BLEU or TER scores is not sufficient to understand what improved or what went wrong.",
        "Error analysis can of course be done manually (Vilar et al., 2006), but it is often too slow and expensive to be performed as often as needed during system development.",
        "Several metrics have been recently proposed to evaluate specific aspects of translation quality such as word order (Birch et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2012).",
        "While word order is indirectly taken into account by BLEU, TER or METEOR scores, dedicated metrics provide a direct evaluation that lets us understand whether a given system's reordering performance improved during system development.",
        "Word order metrics provide a complementary tool for targeting evaluation and analysis to a specific aspect of machine translation quality.",
        "There has not been as much work on evaluating the lexical choice performance of MT: does a MT system preserve the meaning of words in translation?",
        "This is of course measured indirectly by commonly used global metrics, but a more focused evaluation can help us gain a better understanding of the behavior of MT systems.",
        "In this paper, we show that MT lexical choice can be framed and evaluated as a standard Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) task.",
        "We leverage existing WSD shared tasks in order to evaluate whether word meaning is preserved in translation.",
        "Let us emphasize that, just like reordering metrics, our WSD evaluation is meant to complement global metrics of translation quality.",
        "In previous work, intrinsic evaluations of lexical choice have been performed using either semi-automatically constructed data sets",
        "based on MT reference translations (Gime?nez and Ma`rquez, 2008; Carpuat and Wu, 2008), or manually constructed word sense disambiguation test beds that do not exactly match MT lexical choice (Carpuat and Wu, 2005).",
        "We will show how existing Cross-Lingual Word Sense Disambiguation tasks (Lefever and Hoste, 2010; Lefever and Hoste, 2013) can be directly seen as machine translation lexical choice (Section 2): their sense inventory is based on translations in a second language rather than arbitrary sense representations used in other WSD tasks (Carpuat and Wu, 2005); unlike in MT evaluation settings, human annotators can more easily provide a complete representation of all correct meanings of a word.",
        "Second, we show how using this task for evaluating the lexical choice performance of several phrase-based SMT systems (PB-SMT) gives some insights into their strengths and",
        "weaknesses (Section 5).",
        "2 Selecting a Word Sense Disambiguation Task to Evaluate MT Lexical Choice Word Sense Disambiguation consists in determining",
        "the correct sense of a word in context.",
        "This challenging problem has been studied from a rich variety of persectives in Natural Language Processing (see Agirre and Edmonds (2006) for an overview.)",
        "The Senseval and SemEval series of evaluations (Edmonds and Cotton, 2001; Mihalcea and Edmonds, 2004; Agirre et al., 2007) have driven the standardization of methodology for evaluating WSD systems.",
        "Many shared tasks were organized over the years, providing evaluation settings that vary along several dimensions, including: ?",
        "target vocabulary: in all word tasks, systems are expected to tag all content words in running text (Palmer et al., 2001), while in lexical sample tasks, the evaluation considers a smaller predefined set of target words (Mihalcea et al., 2004; Lefever and Hoste, 2010).",
        "?",
        "language: English is by far the most studied language, but the disambiguation of words in other languages such as Chinese (Jin et al., 2007) has been considered.",
        "?",
        "sense inventory: many tasks use WordNet senses (Fellbaum, 1998), but other sense representations have been used, including alternate semantic databases such as HowNet (Dong, 1998), or lexicalizations in one or more languages (Chklovski et al., 2004).",
        "The Cross-Lingual Word Sense Disambiguation (CLWSD) task introduced at a recent edition of SemEval (Lefever and Hoste, 2010) is an English lexical sample task that uses translations in other European languages as a sense inventory.",
        "As a result, it is particularly well suited to evaluating machine translation lexical choice."

        "MT system predictions can be compared to human annotations directly, without introducing additional sources of ambiguity and mismatches due to representation differences.",

        "Words that share the same concept can be viewed as synonyms.",
        "Evaluating MT using a gold standard of HowNet categories requires to map translations from the MT output to the HowNet representation.",

        "When constructing the gold annotation, human annotators are given occurrences of target words in context.",
        "For each occurrence, they select a sense cluster and provide all translations from this cluster that are correct in this specific context.",

        "A more detailed description of the annotation process can be found in (Lefever and Hoste, 2010).",
        "Again, this contrasts with our previous work on evaluating MT on a HowNet-based Chinese WSD task, where Chinese sentences were manually annotated with HowNet senses which were completely unrelated to the parallel corpus used for training the SMT system.",

        "MEANT uses vector-space based lexical similarity scores (Lo et al., 2012).",
        "While these methods lead to higher correlations with human judgements on average, they are not ideal for a fine-grained evaluation of lexical choice: similarity scores are defined independently of context and might give credit to incorrect translations (Carpuat et al., 2012).",
        "In contrast, CLWSD solves this difficult problem by providing all correct translation candidates in context according to several human annotators.",
        "These multiple translations provide a more complete representation of the correct meaning of each occurrence of a word in context.",
        "The CLWSD annotation procedure is designed to easily let human annotators provide many correct translation alternatives for a word.",

        "Machine translation evaluations typically use between one and four reference translations, which provide a very incomplete representation of the correct semantics of the input sentence in the output language.",

        "In addition, the data available through the shared task does not let us evaluate complete translations of the CLWSD test sentences, since full references translations are not available.",
        "Instead of using",
        "a WSD dataset for MT purposes, we could take the converse approach andautomatically construct a WSD test set based on MT evaluation corpora (Vickrey et al., 2005; Gime?nez and Ma`rquez, 2008; Carpuat and Wu, 2008; Carpuat et al., 2012).",
        "However, this approach suffers from noisy automatic alignments between source and reference, as well as from a limited representation of the correct meaning of words in context due to the limited number of reference translations.",
        "Other SemEval tasks such as the Cross-Lingual Lexical Substitution Task (Mihalcea et al., 2010) would also provide an appropriate test bed.",
        "We focused on the CLWSD task, since it uses senses drawn from the Europarl parallel corpus, and therefore offers more constrained settings for comparison between systems.",

        "Since increasing the amount of training data is a reliable way to improve translation performance, we evaluate the impact of training the PBSMT system on more than the Europarl data used for controlled comparison with WSD.",
        "We increase the parallel training corpus with the WMT-12 News Commentary parallel data 4.",
        "This yields an additional training set of roughly160k sentence pairs.",
        "We build linear mixture models to combine translation, reordering and language models learned on Europarl and News Commentary corpora (Foster and Kuhn, 2007).",
        "As can be seen in Table 6, this approach improves all CLWSD scores except for 1-gram precision.",
        "The decrease in 1-gram precision indicates that the addition of the news corpus introduces new translation candidates that differ from those used in the gold inventory.",
        "Interestingly, the additional data is not sufficient to match the performance of the WSD system learned on Europarl only (see Table 2).",
        "While additional data should be used when available, richer context features are valuable to make the most of",
        "formance: adding news parallel sentences helps Precision and Recall, but does not match WSD on the Europarl only."

        "We use a SemEval Cross-Lingual WSD task to evaluate the lexical choice performance of a typical phrase-based SMT system.",
        "Unlike conventional WSD task that rely on abstract sense inventories rather than translations, cross-lingual WSD provides a fair setting for comparing SMT with dedicated WSD systems.",
        "Unlike conventional evaluations of machine translation quality, the cross-lingual WSD task lets us isolate a specific aspect of translation quality and show how it is affected by different components of the phrase-based SMT system.",
        "Unlike in previous evaluations on conventional WSD tasks (Carpuat and Wu, 2005), phrase-based SMT performance is on par with many dedicated WSD systems.",
        "However, the phrase-based SMT system does not perform as well as a WSD system trained on the exact same parallel data.",
        "Analysis shows that while many SMT components can potentially have an impact on SMT lexical choice, CLWSD accuracy is most affected by the length of source phrases and order of target n-gram language models.",
        "Using shorter source phrases actually improves lexical choice accuracy.",
        "The official results for the CLWSD task at SemEval 2013 evaluation provide further insights (Lefever and Hoste, 2013): our PBSMT system can achieve top precision as measured using the top prediction as in this paper, but does not perform as well as other submitted systems when taking into account the top 5 predictions (Carpuat, 2013).",
        "This suggests that local context models based on source phrases and target n-grams are much weaker representations of context than the simple templates used by WSD systems, and that even strong PBSMT systems can benefit from context models developed for WSD.",
        "New learning algorithms (Chiang et al., 2009; Cherry and Foster, 2012, for instance) finally make it possible for PBSMT to reliably learn from many more features than the typical system used here.",
        "Evaluations such as the CLWSD task will provide useful tools for analyzing the impact of these features on lexical choice and inform feature design in increasingly large and complex systems."
