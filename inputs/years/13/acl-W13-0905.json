        "demonstrate a possible useful gain in recall of metaphors, our original aim.",
        "The algorithm is described in two implementations (or pipelines) cor-responding, respectively, to the use of WN and VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2000; Kipper et al., 2008) as semantic knowledge-bases, and to their replacement by our automatically recomputed form of WN, which enables predictions about the preference behavior (see below) of English verbs and adjectives to be better founded than in VerbNet (VN) and on a much larger scale.",
        "2 Background on Metaphor Detection using Preference Violation as Cue In early work on metaphor detection, long preceding access to large-scale or annotated corpora, it was suggested as sufficient a criterion for being a metaphor that a ?semantic preference?",
        "of a verb or adjective was violated (Wilks, 1978).",
        "So, for ex-ample, one might say that the verb drink had a preference for animate agents and liquid objects, in which case ?My car drinks gasoline?",
        "violates its subject preference, which might then be a cue to look for metaphor at that point.",
        "Similarly, in the ?economic muscle?",
        "case mentioned earlier one might say that economic has a preference for abstract entities as objects, as in ?economic value?, and muscle is not an abstract entity.",
        "There was discussion in those early days of syntac-tic-semantic interface cases like ?John ran a mile?",
        "where a mile might be said to violate the preference of the (intransitive) verb for a zero object and so again trigger a metaphor.",
        "The preference notion was not initially intended to detect metaphor but to semantically disambiguate candidates at those sites by preferring those conceptual entities that did not violate such restrictions.",
        "In early work, preferences were largely derived by intuition and sometimes ordered by salience.",
        "Later (e.g. Resnik, 1997) there was a range of work on deriving such preferences from corpora; however, in VN the semantic preferences of verbs were again largely intuitive in ori-gin.",
        "Early work linking preference violation to metaphor detection (summarised in Fass and Wilks, 1983, also Martin 1990) worked with hand-crafted resources, but by 1995 Dolan had noted (Dolan, 1995) that large-scale lexical resources would have implications for metaphor detection, and WN was used in conjunction with corpora, by (Peters and Wilks, 2003) using symbolic methods and by Mason (2004) and Krishnakumaran and Zhu (2007) using a combination of WN and statistical methods.",
        "Mason also acquires preferences automatically from corpora, and the latter two papers treat metaphor as a form of anomaly based on rare combinations of surface words and of WN-derived hypernyms, a notion that appears in (Guthrie et al., 2007) but based only on corpus sparsity and not WN codings.",
        "Other work on the automatic acquisition of preferences (McCarthy and Carrol, 2003) for WSD has also its considered extension to the detection of classes of metaphor.",
        "More recently, work by Shutova (Shutova et al., 2010) has shown that the original preference violation insight can be combined with large-scale in-vestigations, using notions of machine learning and large-scale resources like WN.",
        "Our approach is smaller scale and does not involve machine learn-ing: it simply seeks access to implicit metaphors built into the structure of WN by its creators, and which a preference-violation detection criterion cannot, by definition, access.",
        "Thus, we view our contribution as complementary to larger efforts on metaphor and interpretation detection, rather than a competing approach.",
        "We have not made comparisons here with the work of (Li and Sporleder, 2010), which is explicitly concerned with idioms, nor with (Markert and Nissim, 2009) which is focused on metonymy.",
        "3 The Conventional Metaphor Detection Hypotheses Where WN codes conventionalized metaphors as senses, as in the initial cases described, then the senses expressing these will NOT violate preferences and so will not be detected by any metaphor-as-violation hypothesis.",
        "For example, in ?Jane married a brick?",
        "this will not be a preference violation against WN senses because WN explicitly codes brick as a reliable person, though we would almost certainly want to say this sentence contains a metaphor to be detected.",
        "The hypothesis we propose is simply this: if we have a word whose main (usually first) sense in WN fails the main preference for the sentence slot it fills, but has a lower, less frequent, sense that satisfies that preference, then we declare that lower sense a metaphorical one.",
        "In the case of brick, whose main sense is a PHYSICAL OBJECT, one",
        "which clearly fails the equivalence to Tom in the example ?Tom is a brick?.",
        "Yet the less frequent listed sense for a reliable person does satisfy the same preference.",
        "The work at this stage is not concerned with the metaphor-metonymy distinction and this criterion may well capture both, their distinction being, as is well known (e.g. in Fass and Wilks, 1983) hard to establish in the limit.",
        "Ours is a purely empirical hypothesis and will work or not, and we argue that it does to a reasonable degree.",
        "It does not rest on any assumption of strict ordering of WN senses, only on a tendency (from literal to metaphorical) which is plainly there for any ob-server.",
        "4 Metaphor Detection Experiments We have implemented two versions of conventional metaphor detection, using two different lexical resources.",
        "We were thus able to divide the hypothesis into two parts, essentially one making use of VN and one within WN only.",
        "In this first pipeline, we use WN together with the verb preferences provided by VN even though those give only patchy coverage of common verbs.",
        "At the outset this was the only lexical resource for verb preferences available.",
        "VN includes classes of verbs that map members to specific WN senses.",
        "VN also provides a hierarchy of verb object/subject inclu-sions, which we use for assessing whether one sentence object/subject type appears below another in this simple inclusion hierarchy, and so can be said to be semantically included in it.",
        "The selectional restrictions, however, are not linked to any lexicons so a mapping was constructed in order to allow for automated detection of preference violations.",
        "Our first experiment utilizes WN, VN, and the Stanford Parser (de Marneffe et al., 2006) and Named Entity Recognizer (Finkel et al., 2005).",
        "The Stanford Parser identifies the verbs, as well as their corresponding subjects and direct objects.",
        "The Stanford Named Entity Recognizer was used to replace sequences of text representing names with WN senses whose hypernyms exist in the selectional restriction hierarchy.",
        "The first step in determining whether a sentence contains a metaphor is to extract all verbs along with the subject and direct object arguments for each verb.",
        "The Stanford Parser dependencies used to describe the relationships between verbs and their arguments include agent, nsubj, and xsubj for subjects and dobj and nsubjpass for direct objects.",
        "The parser also handles copular and prepositional verbs but additional steps are required to link these verbs to their arguments.",
        "Once verbs have been extracted and parameter-ized from the sentence, each is checked for preference violations.",
        "A preference is violated if a selectional restriction on one of the thematic roles of a VN class is not satisfied for all VN classes the verb is a member of.",
        "In order for a VN class's preferences to be satisfied, there must be a WN sense for the argument of a verb such that either itself or its hypernym matches the WN senses allowed by the selectional restriction in VN class, where the terms in the VN hierarchy have been hand-matched to WN senses.",
        "If a sentence contains a verb that does not exist in VN then we must assume that it is not violated.",
        "5 Conventionalized Metaphor Detection Closer inspection of false negatives revealed that many of the verbs and the arguments that satisfied their selectional restrictions were unannotated conventionalized metaphors.",
        "5.1 Conventionalized Verbs In our approach, a conventionalized verb occurs when two VN Classes have the same member, but one maps to a lower WN sense (in the WN order-ing, which can be taken roughly to mean less fre-quent) than the other.",
        "If the VN Class mapped to the lower sense is satisfied in a sentence, but the other VN Class is not, we say that the verb is used in a conventionalized sense.",
        "The verb pour is a member of four VN classes.",
        "Three of those classes, Pour-9.5, Preparing-26.3-2, and Sub-stance_Emission-43.4 all map to first sense of the word which means to cause to run.",
        "The fourth VN class of pour, Weather-57, maps to the sixth WN sense of the verb, which means to rain heavily.",
        "If we take the example sentence ?Bisciotti has poured money into the team?, we determine that all VN classes that map to the primary WN sense of pour are violated in some way.",
        "According to our semantic role labeling heuristic, Pour-9.5 expects money to be a substance, Preparing-26.3-2 expects the team to be an animate, and Sub-stance_Emission-43.4 is violated because Bisciotti is animate.",
        "The only Verb Class that is satisfied is",
        "Weather-57, and that class maps to the sixth sense of pour.",
        "Interestingly, there is no VN class member that maps to the fifth WN sense (supply in large amounts or quantities).",
        "The pseudocode for detecting conventional metaphors used as verbs is as follows: ?",
        "for each VN Class ?",
        "for each member of that class ?",
        "for each WN sense of that member with Verb POS ?",
        "get the sense number of the WN sense ?",
        "associate the sense number to the verb member and selectional restrictions for the Verb Class ?",
        "given a verb in a sentence, decide that the verb is conventionalized if: ?",
        "it satisfies the selectional restrictions of one Verb Class V1 but?",
        "?",
        "it violates the selectional restrictions of another Verb Class V2 and?",
        "?",
        "the sense number of the verb member in V2 is above the sense number of the verb member in V1 5.2 Conventionalized Nouns Let us look again at the example of brick, where the primary sense of the noun is the building material most are familiar with and the secondary sense refers to a reliable person.",
        "For this reason, the noun brick will satisfy any VN class that requires a human or animate.",
        "Without the ability to detect conventional metaphors in noun arguments, She married a brick would pass through without detection by preference violation.",
        "Here are the WN entries for the two senses: ?",
        "brick#1 (brick%1:06:00::) (rectangular block of clay baked by the sun or in a kiln; used as a building or paving material) ?",
        "brick#2 (brick%1:18:00::) (a good fellow; helpful and trustworthy) Less obvious are more abstract words such as zone: ?",
        "zone#1 (zone%1:15:00::) (a locally circumscribed place characterized by some distinctive features) ?",
        "zone#2 (zone%1:15:02::), geographical zone#1 (geographical_zone%1:15:00::) (any of the regions of the surface of the Earth loosely divided according to latitude or longitude) ?",
        "zone#3 (zone%1:15:01::) (an area or region distinguished from adjacent parts by a distinctive feature or characteristic) ?",
        "zone#4 (zone%1:08:00::), zona#1 (zona%1:08: 00::) ((anatomy) any encircling or beltlike struc-ture) Zone's primary sense, again, is the anticipated concept of circumscribed space.",
        "However, the fourth sense deals with anatomy, and therefore is a hypo-nym of body part.",
        "Body part is capable of satisfying any thematic role restricted to animate arguments.",
        "The pseudocode for detecting conventional metaphors used as nouns is as follows: ?",
        "determine if verbs?",
        "subjects and direct objects satisfy the restriction ?",
        "if not, it is a Preference Violation metaphor ?",
        "if they do: ?",
        "determine if the sense of the satisfying word is the primary sense in WN ?",
        "if not, it is a conventional metaphor ?",
        "otherwise, it is not a metaphor Thus, our overall hypothesis is intended to locate in the very broad WN sense sets those that are actually conventionalized metaphors: we determine that only the first sense, hopefully literal, should be able to satisfy any restriction.",
        "If a lower sense satisfies a verb, but the primary sense does not, we classify the satisfaction as being conventionalized, but a metaphor nonetheless.",
        "6 Deriving Preferences and an Ontology from WordNet To date, VerbNet is the most extensive resource for verb roles and restrictions.",
        "It provides a rich semantic role taxonomy with some selectional re-strictions.",
        "Still, VN has entries for less than 4000 verbs.",
        "PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) has additional coverage, but uses a more surface oriented role set with no selectional restrictions.",
        "On the other hand, WordNet has many more verb entries but they lack semantic role information.",
        "However, we believe it is possible to extract automatically a comprehensive lexicon of verbs with semantic roles and selectional restrictions from WN by processing definitions in WN using deep understanding techniques.",
        "Specifically, each verb in WN comes with a gloss that defines the verb sense, and there we can find clues about the semantic roles and their selectional restrictions.",
        "Thus, we are testing the hypothesis that the semantic roles of the verb being defined are inherited from the roles in its definition, though roles in the latter may be elided or fully specified.",
        "For example, consider this entry from WN for one of the senses of the verb kill: S: (v) kill (cause to die; put to death, usually intentionally or knowingly) ?This man killed several people when he tried to rob the bank?",
        "; ?the farmer killed a pig for the holidays?",
        "Let us assume we already know that the verb cause takes three roles, say, a CAUSER, an AFFECTED and an EFFECT role; this leads us to hypothesize that kill would take the same roles.",
        "However, the EFFECT role from cause is not inherited by kill as it is fully specified in the definition.",
        "The proof of",
        "this hypothesis is ultimately in how well it predicts the role set.",
        "But intuitively, any role in the definition verb (i.e., cause) that is fully filled in the definition has no ?space?",
        "for a new argument for that role.",
        "Therefore, we conclude that kill takes two roles, filling the CAUSER and AFFECTED roles in the definition.",
        "We can now derive selectional restrictions for kill by looking at inherited restrictions from the definition, as well as those that can be derived from the examples.",
        "From the definition, the verb cause puts little to no restriction on what the CAUSER role might be.",
        "For instance, an animal may cause something, but natural forces cause things as well.",
        "Likewise, cause puts little constraint on what the PATIENT role might be, as one can cause the temperature to rise, or an idea to fade.",
        "The restriction from the verb die in the com-plement, however, suggests a restriction of some living object (if we can derive this constraint from die).",
        "We also look at the examples to find more informative restrictions.",
        "In the definition of kill, we have two examples of a CAUSER, namely a man and a farmer.",
        "Given the hypernym hierarchy of nouns in WordNet, we could look for the most specific subsuming concept in the hierarchy for the concepts MAN and FARMER, finding it to be person%1:03:00.",
        "The fillers for the AFFECTED role in the examples are PEOPLE and PIG, with the most specific WN node being organ-ism%1:03:00).",
        "Putting all this together, we produce an entry for kill as follows: kill: ACTOR/person%1:03:00 PATIENT/organism%1:03:00 To implement this idea we need a number of capa-bilities.",
        "First, semantic roles do not appear out of the ether, so we need an initial seed of semantic role information.",
        "In addition, to process the glosses we need a parser that can build a semantic repre-sentation, including the handling of elided argu-ments.",
        "As a start, we use the TRIPS parser (Allen et al., 2008).",
        "The TRIPS lexicon provides information on semantic roles, and the parser can construct the required semantic structures.",
        "TRIPS has been shown to be successful at parsing WN glosses in order to build commonsense knowledge bases (Al-len et al., 2011).",
        "With around 3000 types, TRIPS offers a reasonable upper-level ontology to serve as the seed for semantic roles.",
        "We also use the TRIPS selectional restrictions to bootstrap the process of determining the restrictions for new words.",
        "To attain broad lexical coverage, the TRIPS parser uses input from a variety of external re-sources.",
        "This includes a subsystem, Wordfinder, for unknown word lookup that accesses WN when an unknown word is encountered.",
        "The WN senses have mappings to semantic types in the TRIPS on-tology, although sometimes at a fairly abstract level.",
        "When faced with an unknown word, the parser looks up the possible senses in WordNet, maps these to the TRIPS ontology and then uses the verb entries in the TRIPS lexicon associated with these types to suggest possible subcatgorization frames with mappings to roles.",
        "Thus, Word-finder uses the combined information from WN and the TRIPS lexicon and ontology to dynamically build lexical entries with approximate semantic and syntactic structures for words not in the core lexicon.",
        "This process may produce a range of different possibilities based on the different senses and possible subcategorization frames for the verbs that share the same TRIPS type.",
        "We feed all of these to the parser and let it determine the entries that best match the definition and examples.",
        "While WordNet may have multiple fine-grained senses for a given word, we set a parameter that has the system use only the most frequent sense(s) of the word (cf. McCarthy et al. 2004).",
        "We use TRIPS to parse the definitions and glosses into a logical form.",
        "Figure 3 shows the logical form produced for the definition cause to die.",
        "We then search the logical form for structures that signal a potential argument that would fill a role.",
        "Besides looking for gaps, we found some other devices that serve the same purpose and occur frequently in WordNet:"
