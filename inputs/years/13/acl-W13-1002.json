        "Although dictionaries mention some of the lexicalized combinations, either under the entry associated to the verb, or to the non verbal element, the underlying criteria in the choice of combinations is far from being clear and the resulting list significantly varies from one dictionary to another.",
        "Computational studies have also mentioned the lack of large-scale lexical resources for Persian and have developed probabilistic measures to determine the acceptability of the combination of a verb and a noun as a CP (Taslimipoor et al., 2012).",

        "In other words, if one establishes a scale of specificity in the verbal meaning (Ritter and Rosen, 1996) going from highly specific verbs (e.g. google, milk) to lowly specific ones (e.g. do, make), most Persian verbs are located somewhere in the middle of the scale.",
        "Consequently, in many CPs, the verb has a lexical semantic content and cannot be considered as a light verb sensu stricto.",
        "This also entails that Persian CPs are not always as idiomatic as English LVCs, for instance, and that many aspects of their formation can be accounted for via compositionality.",
        "By providing a fine-grained semantic classification for Persian CPs, PersPred proposes a solution that does justice to the compositionality of these combinations, thus allowing to account for their productivity.",
