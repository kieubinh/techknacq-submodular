        "In software engineering, business knowledge and the needs of a system's users are analyzed and specified by a process called requirement elicitation (RE).",
        "Traditionally, RE has been carried out by human analysts through techniques such as interviews, observations, questionnaires, etc.",
        "The information obtained by the analyst is then converted to a controlled language used further stages of software implementation.",
        "These techniques, however, necessarily increase costs and imply a certain degree of subjectivity.",
        "Sometimes, as an alternative approach for RE, human analysts elicit requirement from documents instead of from clients or users.",
        "The present work, proposes the use multiword expressions (MWEs) such as collocations and syntactically-flexible, lexicalized phrases to detect relevant patterns in ?job specification documents?",
        "(a kind of corporate technical document).",
        "The approach contributes to the task of generating controlled language used in subsequent automated knowledge representation.",
        "MWEs are lexical items which can be decomposed into multiple lexemes with lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and/or statistical idiomaticity (Baldwin et al., 2010).",
        "According to Bauer (1983), MWEs can be broadly classified into lexicalized phrases and institutionalized phrases.",
        "Institutionalized phrases, or collocations, basically require a high frequency of co-occurrence of their components.",
        "Lexicalized phrases (LP), on the other hand, may present other kind of idiomaticity, but not only statistical.",
        "Along with collocations, out of the set of lexicalized phrase types, we find syntactically-flexible, lexicalized phrases and semi-fixed phrases of special interest for the present work.",
        "Based on an experimental corpus, we identify when and how a MWE is used in order to identify patterns, infer organizational relationships, and generate corporate information and/or conceptual models for further requirement elicitation.",
        "We propose context analysis?in which MWEs occur?would contribute by adding essential information to the pattern definition.",
        "Such patterns are conceived from the structural and functional components inherent to corporate documents.",
        "This means that we classify MWEs according to the section in the document where they prevail.",
        "We expect the automated processing of such patterns helps in the identification and understanding of domain knowledge and business information from an organization.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we describe the conceptual",
        "framework and background.",
        "Section 3 presents examples and analysis of the MWEs used for this study.",
        "Last, Section 4 draws conclusions and outlines future work."

        "ground Two main lines converge on this study, namely requirements elicitation belonging to software engineering and linguistic description and parsing related to natural language processing.",
        "Requirements elicitation (RE) is the initial process from requirement engineering in the software development process lifecycle.",
        "RE involves seeking, uncovering, capturing, and elaborating requirements, based on activities of the business analysis initially performed.",
        "This process comprises functional, behavioral, and quality properties of the software to be developed (Castro-Herrera et al., 2008).",
        "In order to accomplish RE, an analyst should increasingly and iteratively develop several actions involving natural language analysis and modeling (Li et al., 2003).",
        "On the other hand, a user of a language has available a large number of pre-constructed phrases conforming single choices, even though they might appear to be analyzable into segments (Sinclair, 1991).",
        "Such phrases are known as lexical phrases (LPs) and may have a pragmatic function.",
        "According to P?rez (1999), the importance of LPs lies in their usage and domain, which constitute an integral part of the communicative competence.",
        "In the same line of thought, L?pez-Mezquita (2007) categorizes LPs into polywords, institutionalized expressions, phrasal constraints, and sentence builders.",
        "For this study, we use the classification of MWEs proposed by Baldwin et al. (2010).",
        "This and other classifications have been used in natural language processing techniques for text-mining and information extraction.",
        "They also have been applied to the analysis of many kinds of documents, e.g., technical documents, patents, and software requirement documents.",
        "Cascini et al. (2004) present a functional analysis of patents and their implementation in the PAT-Analyzer tool.",
        "They use techniques based on the extraction of the interactions between the entities described in the document and expressed as subject-action-object triples, by using a suitable syntactic parser.",
        "R?sner et al. (1997) use techniques to automatically generate multilingual documents from knowledge bases.",
        "The resulting documents can be represented in an interchangeable, reusable way.",
        "The authors describe several techniques for knowledge acquisition from documents by using particular knowledge structures from particular contexts.",
        "Breaux et al. (2006) describe the extraction of rights and obligations from regulation texts restated into restricted natural language statements.",
        "In this approach, the authors identify normative phrases that define what stakeholders are permitted or required to do, and then extract rights and obligations by using normative phrases.",
        "For knowledge acquisition, several authors have applied NLP techniques for handling MWEs.",
        "Jackendoff (1997) and Aussenac-Gilles et al. (2000) extract knowledge from existing documents and demonstrate its usage on the ontological engineering research domain.",
        "Some other contributions are related to the extraction of multiword expressions from corpora, empirical work on lexical semantics in comparative fields, word sense disambiguation, and ontology learning (Bannard, 2005).",
        "In the intersection of NLP and requirement elicitation, Lee and Bryant (2002) use contextual techniques to overcome the ambiguity and express domain knowledge in the DARPA agent markup language (DAML).",
        "The resulting expression from the linguistic processing is a formal representation of the informal natural language requirements.",
        "For processing technical and organizational documentation, Dinesh et al. (2007) propose the description of organizational procedures and the validation of their conformance to regulations, based on logical analysis.",
        "L?vy et al. (2010) present an environment that enables semantic annotations of document textual units (e.g., words, phrases, paragraphs, etc.)",
        "with ontological information (concepts, instances, roles, etc.).",
        "This approach provides an ontology-driven interpretation of the document contents.",
        "Some work has been also developed to perform corpus-based analysis from several technical documents, as follows: for the use of frequency and concordance data from a corpus, Flowerdew (1993) work on English biology lectures; Lam (2007) propose the processing of English tourism",
        "documents looking for pedagogical implications of its usage; and Henry and Roseberry (2001) observe English application letters.",
        "In other lines of thought, we found language models accounting for documents oriented to audit linguistic expertise and analyze communicative and health texts (Fern?ndez & Garc?a, 2009)."
