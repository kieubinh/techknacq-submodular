        "Grading is a primary cognitive operation that has an important expressive function.",
        "Information on degree is grammatically relevant and constitutes what Lazard (2006) calls a primary domain of grammaticalization: According to typological studies (Cuzzolin & Lehmann, 2004), many languages of the world have in fact at their disposal multiple grammatical devices to express gradation.",
        "In Italian, the class of superlativizing structures alternative to the morphological superlative is very rich and consists, among others, of adverbs of degree, focalizing adverbs and prototypical comparisons.",
        "This contribution deals with a particular analytic structure of superlative in Italian that is still neglected in the literature.",
        "This is what we will call Constructional Intensifying Adjectives (CIAs), adjectives which modify the intensity of other adjectives on the basis of regular semantic patterns, thus giving rise to multiword superlative constructions of the type: ADJX+ADJINTENS.",
        "A comparative quantitative corpus analysis demonstrates that this strategy, though para-digmatically limited, is nonetheless widely exploited: From a distributional point of view, some of these CIAs only combine with one or a few adjectives and form MWEs that appear to be completely lexicalized, while some others modify wider classes of adjectives thus displaying a certain degree of productivity."

        "Even when gradation is not realized through morphology, languages show numerous alternative analytical forms for expressing the extent to which the quality expressed by the adjective applies to an entity.",
        "In this paper we will focus on a particular strategy of absolute superlative in Italian: The absolute superlative indicates that the quality expressed by the predicate is present at the highest degree, without making any comparison with other entities (1a), or at least to a very high degree on the scale of the corresponding values (Sapir, 1944), (1b): 1) a.

        "Due to the ?human fondness of exaggeration?",
        "(Bolinger, 1972), the array of processes employed to realize the superlative degree is very wide, both cross-and intralinguistically.",
        "As for morphological strategies, the highest grade is generally formed by means of reduplication or affixation; however, the most common process to form the superlative among the world's languages is the use of an unbound lexeme.",
        "Indeed, ?almost every language has a word meaning roughly very which, preposed or postposed, combines with the adjective?",

        "As this kind of word formation seems to function through analogy or semantic contiguity (SillerRunggaldier, 2006), it is legitimate to think that it appears firstly in the discourse space and then into the system (in Coseriu's sense; cf. Coseriu, 1962).",
        "That's why a direct follow up of this research could be that of extending the analysis to other corpora representative of those language varieties which are more sensitive to experimentation.4 Moreover, the computational comparison between competitive superlative constructions could be deepened in order to understand which kind of syntactic or pragmatic constraints influence the use of different strategies: In this perspective a collo-structional analysis (Stefanowitsch and Gries, 2003) ought to be more informative of the data extracted so far.",
        "Such a method could also profitably be extended to the analysis of analogous intensification strategies applied to different parts of speech.",
        "Indeed, many nouns show intensification patterns comparable to the one presented here (freddo polare, idiota completo) and also some verbs exists which are often intensified by means of oblique uses of some particular adjectives (studiare duro, lavorare sodo).",
        "First experiments with the web-derived corpus Pais?",
        "(250 million tokens) showed however that this corpus is considerably closer to written than to spoken language."
