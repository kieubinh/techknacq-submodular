        "We compare the performance of the High Precision Classifier that was trained based on statistical measures against one that keeps human annotators in the loop, and find that Classifiers using statistically selected indicators appear to be over-trained on the development set because they do not generalize well.",
        "This first phase achieves 54% precision and 38% recall for sarcastic utterances using the human selected indicators.",
        "If we bootstrap by using syntactic patterns to create more general sarcasm indicators from the utterances identified as sarcastic in the first phase, we achieve a higher precision of 62% and recall of 52%.",

        "Our first phase, using crowdsourced nasty indicators, achieves 58% precision and 49% recall, which increases to 75% precision and 62% recall when we bootstrap with syntactic patterns, possibly suggesting that nastiness (insults) are less nuanced and easier to detect than sarcasm.",

        "While the nasty works do not report precision, we believe that they are comparable to the 64% - 83% accuracy with our precision of 75%.",
