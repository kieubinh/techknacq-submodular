        "Even though tweets that have been labelled as sarcastic have been omitted from this set, it still represents a difficult test set and the highest accuracy we achieve is 61.6% using supervised learning and a feature set consisting of subjectivity-lexicon-based scores, Twitter-specific features and the top 1,000 most discriminative words.",

        "In this paper we describe sentiment analysis experiments in a more complicated setup: the task is three-class positive/negative/neutral classification, the sentiment being classified is not at the general document level but rather directed towards a topic, the documents are tweets, and the topic is politics, specifically the Irish General Election of February 2011.",
        "?Akshat Bakliwal and Jennifer van der Puil carried out their part of this work while employed as summer interns at the Centre for Next Generation Localisation(CNGL) in the School of Computing, DCU.",
        "The dataset used in the experiments contains tweets which were collected in the run up to the election and which were subsequently doubly annotated as positive, negative or neutral towards a particular political party or party leader.",
        "The annotators also marked a tweet as sarcastic if its literal sentiment was different to its actual sentiment.",
        "Before exploring the thorny issue of sentiment classification in the face of sarcasm, we simplify the problem by first trying to establish some sentiment analysis baselines for those tweets which were not deemed to be sarcastic.",
        "We first explore a naive approach in which a subjectivity lexicon is used as the primary source of information in determining whether sentiment towards a political party or party leader is positive, negative or neutral.",
        "The best version of this method achieves an accuracy of 58.9, an absolute improvement of 4.9 points over the majority baseline (54%) in which all tweets are classified as neutral.",
        "When these lexicon scores are combined with bag-of-word features and some Twitter-specific features in a supervised machine learning setup, this accuracy increases to 61.6%.",
        "The paper is organised as follows: related work is described in Section 2, followed by a brief discussion of the 2011 Irish General Election in Section 3, a description of the dataset in Section 4 and a description of the natural language processing tools and resources employed in Section 5.",
