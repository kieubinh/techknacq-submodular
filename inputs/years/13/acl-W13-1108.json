        "In this paper, we explore some linguistic high-level features to detect food-health relationships in natural language texts that are perceived reliable.",

        "In this work, we will mine a web corpus of forum entries for such relations.",
        "Social media are a promising source of such knowledge as, firstly, the language employed is not very technical and thus, unlike medical texts, accessible to the general public.",
        "Secondly, social media can be considered as an exclusive repository of popular wisdom.",
        "With regard to the health conditions, we can find, for example, home remedies.",
        "Despite the fact that many of them are not scientifically proven, there is still a great interest in that type of knowledge.",
        "However, even though such content is usually not subject to any scientific review, users would appreciate an automatic assessment of the quality of each relation expressed.",
        "In this work, we attempt a first step towards this endeavour by automatically classifying these utterances with regard to reliability.",
        "The features we examine will be (mostly) based on linguistic insights that are instrumental in finding utterances that are commonly perceived as reliable.",
        "These features are incorporated in a supervised classifier and compared against standard features that are widely used for various tasks in natural language processing, such as bag of words, part-of speech and syntactic parse information.",
        "Our experiments are carried out on German data.",
        "We believe, however, that our findings carry over to other languages since the linguistic aspects that we address are (mostly) language universal.",

        "Relation extraction involving food items has also been explored in the context of ontology alignment (van Hage et al., 2005; van Hage et al., 2006; van Hage et al., 2010) and also as a means of knowledge acquisition for virtual customer advice in a supermarket (Wiegand et al., 2012a).",

        "If a speaker claims to have witnessed a certain relation very frequently or even at all times, then there is a high likelihood that this relation actually holds (14).",

        "The intensifiers we use are a translation of the lexicon introduced in Wilson et al. (2005).",

        "The second group includes more ambiguous expressions, such as adjectives that only function as an intensifier if they modify a polar expression (e.g. horrible pain or terribly nice) otherwise they function as typical polar expressions (e.g. you are horrible?",
        "or he sang terribly?).",
        "We employ two methods to detect these ambiguous expressions.",
        "INTENSpolar requires a polar expression of a polarity lexicon to be modified by the intensifier, while INTENSadj requires an adjective to be modified.",
        "In order to identify polar expressions we use the polarity lexicon underlying the PolArt system (Klenner et al., 2009).",
        "We also consider adjectives since we must assume that our polarity lexicon does not cover all possible polar expressions.",
        "We chose adjectives as a complement criterion as this part of speech is known to contain most polar expressions (Hatzivas-siloglou and McKeown, 1997; Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000).",

        "At the same time, the greatest amount of such adjectives are also subjective expressions (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000).",

        "we have shown this for RELBENEF in Table 7 ?",
        "so the smaller gaps may already have a significant impact.)",
        "In plain, this result means that a statement conveying that some food item alleviates the symptoms of a particular disease or even cures it (RELBENEF ) is more likely to be an utterance that is perceived reliable rather than statements in which the speaker merely states that the food item is suitable given a particular health condition (RELSUIT ).",
        "Presumably, the latter type of suitability-relations are mostly uttered parenthetically (not emphatically), or they are remarks in which the relation is inferred, so that they are unlikely to provide further background information.",
        "In Sentence (20), for example, the suitability of wholemeal products is inferred as the speaker's father eats these types of food due to his diabetes.",
        "The focus of this remark, however, is the psychic well-being of the speaker's father.",
        "That entire utterance does not present any especially reliable or otherwise helpful information regarding the relationship between diabetes and wholemeal products.",
        "(20) My father suffers from diabetes and is fed up with eating all these wholemeal products.",
        "We are worried that he is going to fall into a depression.",
        "Having explained that the two (frequently occurring) positive suitability-labels are highly ranked features because they separate reliable from less reliable statements, one may wonder why we do not find a similar behaviour on the negative suitability-labels.",
        "The answer to this lies in the fact that there is no similar distinction between RELBENEF and RELSUIT among utterances expressing unsuitability.",
        "There is no neutral negative suitability-label similar to RELSUIT .",
        "The relation RELUNSUIT expresses unsuitability which is usually connected with some deterioration in health.",
        "5.1.3 How important are explanatory statements for this task?",
        "We were very surprised that the feature type to indicate explanatory statements EXPL (?4.1.1) performed very poorly (none of its variants is listed in",
        "explanatory statements; EXPLcue: subset of explanatory statements that also contain a lexical cue).",
        "Table 6) since we assumed explanatory statements to be one of the most relevant types of utterances.",
        "In order to find a reason for this, we manually annotated all reliable utterances as to whether they can be regarded as an explanatory statement (EXPLall) and, if so, whether (in principle) there are lexical cues (such as our set of conjunctions) to identify them (EXPLcue).",
        "Table 9 shows the proportion of these two categories among the reliable utterances.",
        "With more than 20% being labeled as this subtype, explanatory statements are clearly not a fringe phenomenon.",
        "However, lexical cues could only be observed in approximately 1/3 of those instances.",
        "The majority of cases, such as Sentence (21), do not contain any lexical cues and are thus extremely difficult to detect.",
        "(21) Citrus fruits are bad for dermatitis.",
        "They increase the itch.",
        "Such fruits are rich in acids that irritate your skin.",
        "In addition, all variants of our feature type EXPL have a poor precision (between 20 ?",
        "25%).",
        "This means that the underlying lexical cues are too ambiguous.",
        "5.1.4 How important are the different contextual scopes?",
        "Table 6 clearly shows that the contextual scope of a feature type matters.",
        "For example, for the feature type FREQ, the most effective scope achieves a Chi-square score of 105.1 while the worst variant only achieves a score of 29.2.",
        "However, there is no unique contextual scope which always outperforms the other variants.",

        "fact the different feature types have different properties.",
        "On the one hand, there are unambiguous feature types, such as AUTH, which work fine with a wide scope.",
        "But we also have ambiguous feature types that require a fairly narrow context.",
