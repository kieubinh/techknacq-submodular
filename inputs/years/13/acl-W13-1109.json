        "Twitter is currently one of the most popular online social networking service after Facebook, and is the fastest-growing, with the half-a-billion user mark reached in June 2012.1 According to Twitter's blog, no less than 65 millions of tweets are published each day, mostly in a single language (40% in English).",
        "This hinders the spread of information, a situation witnessed for instance during the Arab Spring.",
        "Solutions for disseminating tweets in different languages have been designed.",
        "One solution consists in manually translating tweets, which of course is only viable for a very specific subset of the material appearing on Twitter.",
        "For instance, the non-profit organization Meedan2 has been founded in order to organize volunteers willing to translate tweets written in Arabic on Middle East issues.",
        "Another solution consists in using machine translation.",
        "Several portals are facilitating this,3 mainly by using Google's machine translation API.",
        "Curiously enough, few studies have focused on the automatic translation of text produced within social networks, even though a growing number of these studies concentrate on the automated processing of messages exchanged on social networks.",
        "See (Gimpel et al., 2011) for a recent review of some of them.",
        "Some effort has been invested in translating short text messages (SMSs).",
        "Notably, Munro (2010) describes the service deployed by a consortium of volunteer organizations named ?Mission 4636?",
        "during the earthquake that struck Haiti in January 2010.",
        "This service routed SMSs alerts reporting trapped people and other emergencies to a set of volunteers who translated Haitian Creole SMSs into English, so that primary emergency responders could understand them.",
        "In Lewis (2010), the authors describe how the Microsoft translation team developed a statistical translation engine (Haitian Creole into English) in as little as 5 days, during the same tragedy.",
        "Jehl (2010) addresses the task of translating English tweets into German.",
        "She concludes that the proper treatment of unknown words is of the utmost importance and highlights the problem of producing translations of up to 140 characters, the upper limit on tweet lengths.",
        "In (Jehl et al., 2012), the authors describe their efforts to collect bilingual tweets from a stream of tweets acquired programmatically, and show the impact of such a collection on developing an Arabic-to-English translation system.",
        "The present study participates in the effort for the dissemination of messages exchanged over Twitter in different languages, but with a very narrow focus, which we believe has not been addressed specifically yet: Translating tweets written by government institutions.",
        "What sets these messages apart is that, generally speaking, they are written in a proper language (without which their credibility would presumably be hurt), while still having to be extremely brief to abide by the ever-present limit of 140 characters.",
        "This contrasts with typical social media texts in which a large variability in quality is observed (Agichtein et al., 2008).",
        "Tweets from government institutions can also differ somewhat from some other, more informal social media texts in their intended audience and objectives.",
        "Specifically, such tweet feeds often attempt to serve as a credible source of timely information presented in a way that engages members of the lay public.",
        "As such, translations should present a similar degree of credibility, ease of understanding, and ability to engage the audience as in the source tweet?all while conforming to the 140 character limits.",
        "This study attempts to take these matters into account for the task of translating Twitter feeds emitted by Canadian governmental institutions.",
        "This could prove very useful, since more than 150 Canadian agencies have official feeds.",
        "Moreover, while only counting 34 million inhabitants, Canada ranks fifth in the number of Twitter users (3% of all users) after the US, the UK, Australia, and Brazil.4 This certainly explains why Canadian governments, politicians and institutions are making an increasing use",
        "Canadian governmental institutions to disseminate information in both official languages (French and English), we see a great potential value in targeted computer-aided translation tools, which could offer a significant reduction over the current time and effort required to manually translate tweets.",
        "We show that a state-of-the-art SMT toolkit, used off-the-shelf, and trained on out-domain data is unsurprisingly not up to the task.",
        "We report in Section 2 our efforts in mining bilingual material from the Internet, which proves eventually useful in significantly improving the performance of the engine.",
        "We test the impact of simple adaptation scenarios in Section 3 and show the significant improvements in BLEU scores obtained thanks to the corpora we mined.",
        "In Section 4, we provide a detailed account of the problems that remain to be solved, including the translation of hashtags (#-words) omnipresent in tweets and the generation of translations of legal lengths.",
        "We conclude this work-in-progress and discuss further research avenues in Section 5."

        "The reverse directions produced 17.2% of overlong German tweets.",
        "To remedy this, she tried modifying the way BLEU is computed to penalize long translation during the tuning process, with BLEU scores worse than simply truncating the illegal tweets.",
        "The second strategy the author tried consisted in generating n-best lists and mining them to find legal tweets, with encouraging results (for n = 30 000), since the number of overlong tweets was significantly reduced while leaving BLEU scores unharmed.",
        "In order to assess the importance of the problem for our system, we measured the lengths of tweets that a system trained like hans+canbusiness in Table 4 (a mix of in-and out-of-domain data) could produce.",
        "This time however, we used a larger test set and provides a link to read the remainder.",
        "One could also simply truncate an illegal tweet and hope for the best... counting 498 tweets.",

        "When translating from French to English, the 498 translations had lengths ranging from 45 to 138 characters; hence, they were all legal tweets.",
        "From English to French, however, the translations are longer, and range from 32 characters to 223 characters, with 22.5% of them overlong.",
        "One must recall that in our experiments, no tweets were seen at training or tuning time, which explains why the rate of translations that do not meet the limit is high.",
        "This problem deserves a specific treatment for a system to be deployed.",
        "One interesting solution already described by (Jehl, 2010) is to mine the n-best list produced by the decoder in order to find the first candidate that constitutes a legal tweet.",
        "This candidate is then picked as the translation.",

        "The results are shown in Figure 4.",
        "The results clearly show that the n-best list does contain alternate candidates when the best one is too long.",
        "Indeed, not only do we observe that the percentage of remaining illegal tweets can fall steadily (from 22.4% to 6.6% for n = 30 000) as we dig deeper into the list, but also the BLEU score stays unharmed, showing even a slight improvement, from an ini",

        "We presented a number of experiments where we translated tweets produced by Canadian governments institutions and organizations.",
        "Those tweets have the distinguishing characteristic (in the Twitter-sphere) of being written in proper English or French.",
        "We show that mining the urls mentioned in those tweets for parallel sentences can be a fruitful strategy for adapting an out-of-domain translation engine to this task, although further research could show other ways of using this resource, whose quality seems to be high according to our manual evaluation.",
        "We also analyzed the main problems that remain to be addressed before deploying a useful system.",
        "While we focused here on acquiring useful corpora for adapting a translation engine, we admit that the adaptation scenario we considered is very simplistic, although efficient.",
        "We are currently investigating the merit of different methods to adaptation (Zhao et al., 2004; Foster et al., 2010; Daumé III and Jagarlamudi, 2011; Razmara et al., 2012; Sankaran et al., 2012).",
        "Unknown words are of concern, and should be dealt with appropriately.",
        "The serialization of urls was natural, but it could be extended to usernames.",
        "The latter do not need to be translated, but reducing the vocabulary is always desirable when working with a statistical machine translation engine.",
        "One interesting subcategories of out-of-vocabulary tokens are hashtags.",
        "According to our analysis, they require segmentation into words before being translated in 20% of the cases.",
        "Even if they are transformed into regular words (#radon?radon or #genderequality?gender equality), however, it is not clear at this point how to detect if they are used like normally-occurring words in a sentence, as in (#radon is harmful) or if they are simply tags added to the tweet to categorize it.",
        "We also showed that translating under size constraints can be handled easily by mining the n-best list produced by the decoder, but only up to a point.",
        "A remaining 6% of the tweets we analyzed in detail could not find a shorter version.",
        "Numerous ideas are possible to alleviate the problem.",
        "One could for instance modify the logic of the decoder to penalize hypotheses that promise to yield overlong translations.",
        "Another idea would be to manually inspect the strategies used by governmental agencies on Twitter when attempting to shorten their messages, and to select those that seem acceptable and implementable, like the suppression of articles or the use of authorized abbreviations.",
        "Adapting a translation pipeline to the very specific world of governmental tweets therefore poses multiple challenges, each of which can be addressed in numerous ways.",
        "We have reported here the results of a modest but fertile subset of these adaptation strategies."
