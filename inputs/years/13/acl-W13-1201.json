        "learning techniques on available treebanks is of no help.",
        "State of the art systems are using more and more dependency representations which have lately shown great resiliency, robustness, scalability and great adaptability for semantic enrichment and processing.",
        "However, by far the majority of systems available off the shelf don't support a fully semantically consistent representation and lack Null Elements or Antecedents for pronominal ones.",
        "If we limit ourselves to Null Elements, and to PennTreebank (hence PT), we may note that Marcus (?94) referred explicitly to Predicate-Argument Structures (hence PASs) and to the need to address this level of annotation.",
        "He mentions explicitly that ?we intend to automatically extract a bank of PASs intended at the very least for parser evaluation from the resulting annotated corpus?",
        "and further on ?the notation should make it easy to automatically recover PAS?",
        "(ibid.",
        "121).",
        "He also mentions the need to allow for a clear and concise distinction between verb ARGUMENTs and ADJUNCTs, which he asserts to be very difficult to make, consistently.",
        "This happens to be true: the final version of PT II does not include coindexing in controversial cases and has coindexing for null SBJ only in a percentage of the cases.",
        "PT contains 36862 cases of null elements (including traces, expletives, gapping and ambiguity) as listed in Johansson(2007), over 93532 simple clauses and 55600 utterances, for a percentage of 66.3%.",
        "Of course this number does not include pronominal arguments which need to be bound ?",
        "and are not bound in PT - to an antecedent in order to become semantically consistent.",
        "As to PT, the difficulty of the task is testified by the presence of non coindexed Null Elements: in particular we see that they are 8416, that is 22.83%.",
        "If we exclude all traces of WH and topicalization and limit ourselves to the category OTHER TRACES which includes all unexpressed SUBJects of infinitivals and gerundives, we come up with 12172 cases of Null non-coindexed",
        "elements, 33% of all cases.",
        "We should note that for how much large this number may seem, this still represents a small percentage when compared to the number of null elements in languages like Chinese or Romance languages like Italian, which allow for free null subjects insertion in tensed clauses.",
        "Current statistically dependency parsers have made improvements in enriching their structural output representation (Gabbard et al. 2006; Sagae and Tsujii, 2008; ?Choi & Palmer, 2010; ?Cai et al. 2011).",
        "However, coindexation is not always performed: when it is, its performance is computed separately because it is lower than accuracy for labeled/unlabeled tasks.",
        "In particular, Schmid reports 84% F-score for empty elements prediction and 77% for coindexation on PT.",
        "However, other parsers have much worse results, with Johnson(2001) being the worst, with 68% F-score.",
        "The presence of additional difficulties to predict empty categories is the cause of a bad drop in performance in Chinese - no more than 50% accuracy reported by Cai et al. (2011) compared to 74/77% of the labeled/unlabeled task.",
        "Results reported by Yang & Xue (2010) on recovering labeled empty elements in an experiment carried on a small subset of the Penn Chinese Treebank 6.0 reach an average of 60.5% of F-measure.",
        "As to recovery of specific items, we note that over a total number of 290 little_pro items recall fares around 50%.",
        "Of course the phenomenon is very much language dependent, as discussed above.",
        "If we consider a language like Italian ?",
        "which we described fully from structures annotated in the treebank called VIT (Delmonte 2004) ?",
        "we can see that in addition to untensed sentences also simple clauses with tensed verbs show the same problem.",
        "In fact, over 66.5% (9634 over 15874) of all simple clauses are subjectless, they have an omitted or unexpressed subject which is marked in linguistics with a little_pro and the agreement coming from morphology of the main verb.",
        "Of the remaining lexically expressed subjects, only 64% (6166 over 9634) are in canonical position, that is in preverbal position and adjacent to the inflected verb.",
        "The remaining 36% of lexically expresses subjects are positioned to the right or are separated from the verb by other constituents.",
        "2 Events and Null Elements We will now try to describe events in terms of the contribution of Null Elements.",
        "Events are mainly characterized by their meaning which is defined in a gloss or by one or more semantic categories, or even by a synset of synonym concepts.",
        "In addition to that, events may be regarded as being composed of two other elements: - the participants to the event, which are arguments and adjuncts or circumstantials - the spatiotemporal location of the event Both components may be linguistically expressed or be left implicit and thus should be inferred from previous discourse.",
        "In fact the spatiotemporal location of the event is usually indicated explicitly only if needed and is mostly left unexpressed.",
        "Participants on the contrary are mostly explicitly expressed before they can be left implicit.",
        "However, in some case, participants are linguistically unexpressed for structural reasons or else expressed by a pronoun.",
        "Both cases require a deep system or a deep parser together with a pronominal binding algorithm to be in place, in order to find the appropriate antecedent and bind the empty arguments.",
        "There are exceptions to these rules and they are constituted by utterances of generic or arbitrary reference, something intended in utterances such as, (1) Doing regular physical exercise is strongly recommended at a certain age.",
        "where no participant is explicitly indicated, but it is clearly understood by inferences determined by knowledge of the world.",
        "Events may be coreferred or may be queried: in both cases, we are also dealing with semantic relations at discourse structure level.",
        "The need to corefer to a previous event derives from conversational or argumentative strategies.",
        "Generally speaking, it is due to the need of expanding concepts and facts reported in the previous mention.",
        "At a discourse level, this is usually called ELABORATION or EXPLANATION.",
        "Other possible cases of event coreference at discourse structure level can be due to the need of enriching the previous description of additional facts cooccuring with the previously mentioned event: in this case we may have an hypernymic or an hyponymic relation intervening",
        "between the two facts or concepts.",
        "Let's look at some examples taken from the demo text made available by the organizers.",
        "After the title, we have a first event description, reported by a newspaper, which is a violent event followed by an adjunct clause describing the effects or caused consequences: we capitalize event naming words and then indicate the semantic discourse relation: ?A Kurdish newspaper said Wednesday that Iraqi members of an Al Qaeda-linked group, a Kurd and an Arab, BLEW themselves up in northern Iraq on February 1, KILLING at least 105 people.?",
        "CAUSE ??",
        "BLOW, KILL The idea in this case is that the two events are linked by a semantic relation rather than simply the first event being coreferred by the second.",
        "The text continues by expanding the event introducing some comment that elaborates on the previous sentence: ?The twin suicide bombing WAS the deadliest attack in postwar Iraq and WAS SUSPECTED TO HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT by foreign fighters, possibly linked to Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda network.?",
        "ELABORATION ??",
        "BOMBING, ATTACK CAUSE ??",
        "BOMBING, BLOW EXPLANATION ??",
        "SUSPECT(CARRY_OUT), BLOW Discourse relations are triggered by event coreference which in this sentence is achieved by two nominalizations: in fact only definite expressions are taken into consideration, in particular if singular in number.",
        "The first one is TWIN SUICIDE BOMBING which we understand to be a new enriched mention of BLOW at first by a causal relation intervening between BOMB and BLOW.",
        "This semantic relation is not available from WordNet but from Sumo-Milo, where the verbs BOMB, BLAST, ATTACK, KILL, and FIGHT all share one semantic class, VIOLENT_CONTEST and/or DESTRUCTION with BLOW.",
        "The causal relation is derived from commonsense knowledge available in \"ConceptNet\" by the AI Laboratory of MIT.",
        "Searching for relations intervening between BOMB and BLOW_UP, this is what you can find - represented in an appropriate Prolog-like format: cpn(udf,bomb,[blow,something,up]).",
        "cpn(udf,bomb,[blow,things,up]).",
        "cpn(udf,bomb,[blow,up,buildings]).",
        "cpn(udf,bomb,[blow,up,stuff]).",

        "cpn(dof,person,[not,be,blow,up,by,bomb]).",
        "They are also all classified as NEGATIVE polarity items and are part of the same Lexical Field in Roget's Thesaurus.",
        "Then the additional contribution of its arguments, where ?blowing themselves up?",
        "implies a SUICIDE took place.",
        "At the same time, the use of ?twin?",
        "is coreferring with ?members?",
        "a plural noun, better specified as being composed of two individuals ?a Kurd and an Arab?",
        "in an apposition to it.",
        "Thus, the nominalization does not add any new information that could not be understood from previous mention, but certainly clarifies previous information thus respecting Grice's maxims.",
        "The copulative structure headed by WAS, is used to assign a property to the coreferred event thus contributing new information.",
        "We now know that the newspaper reports the event as being ?the deadliest attack in postwar Iraq?.",
        "We also learn that the two fighters identity was suspected to be not Iraqi but possibly ?foreign?, deemed to belong to bin Laden's network.",
        "All of this new information can be labeled as ?Explanation?.",
        "The news story continues by elaborating on the two fighters by expanding on their identity, and then explaining the way in which the bombing was organized in the following two sentences.",
        "?The pair were named respectively as Abu Bakr Hawleri and Kazem Al-Juburi, alias Abu Turab, by independent newspaper Hawlani, which said they belonged to the Army of Ansar al-Sunna.",
        "The Kurd blew himself up in the offices of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and the Arab in the offices of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), both in the Kurdish city of Arbil, said the newspaper.",
        "Each one carried a belt packed with four kilograms (8.8 pounds) of TNT mixed with phosphorus, a highly flammable material, the newspaper said.?",
        "The use of a definite singular expression is highly indicative of the coreference mechanism being activated.",
        "This applies to THE PAIR, coreferring with \"Iraqi members\" and also with \"twin\".",
        "The same can be said of \"The Kurd\" coreferring with the previous mention and also the use of the same predicate BLOW UP.",
        "In the following stretch of discourse, the story corefers to the ?Army of Ansar al-Sunna?, to explain the role that the organization had in the bombing: ?Ansar al-Sunna last week claimed the twin bombings in a statement posted on an Islamist website.",
        "The newspaper said the motive of the attack was to \"punish\" the two Kurdish secular groups, which control Iraqi Kurdistan, for their alliance with the US-led coalition.",
        "The newspaper said Ansar al-Sunna broke away from the Ansar al-Islam group last October and was led by an Arab whose alias is Abu Abdullah Hasan bin Mahmud.",
        "Ansar al-Sunna is more extreme, said the newspaper.?",
        "The first coreference link is expressed by the sentence ?Ansar claimed the TWIN BOMBINGs?",
        "which is used to expand on the role of the organization of the original event.",
        "Additional events are the STATEMENT, a nominal event, and the MOTIVE OF THE ATTACK which introduces the MOTIVATION for the event.",
        "This causal link is connected to actual causal event: PUNISHing the Kurdish group controlling Iraqi Kurdistan.",
        "In turn, the action of PUNISHing is explained by another eventive nominalization, the ALLIANCE of the group (the possessive THEIR corefers with it), with the US-led coalition.",
        "Additional explanation is reported in the final sentence (longer than 40 tokens!!)",
        "where the relation intervening between the motive the attack as contained in the statement and previously occurring facts is further clarified: ?The newspaper added that bin Mahmud is the brother of man whose alias is Abdullah Al-Shami, an Ansar al-Islam leader who was killed last year while fighting a US-backed onslaught by the PUK that forced the group out of its enclave near the Iranian border at the end of March last year.?",
        "The sentence contains additional coreferring nominalizations like ONSLAUGHT, which reminds of the bombing and of the previous attack.",
        "The overall events description is rich in temporal and spatial locations which contribute to the understanding and the overall discourse structure.",
        "In particular we start out by a spatial location, NORTHERN IRAQ, and a temporal location, FEBRUARY 1st.",
        "Both locations remain the same in the following sentences until we reach a change in topics and locations.",

      "heading": "4. A System For Event Marking And Event Coreference I will now go through the text above indicating places where the system has been able to locate and identify missing arguments. In order to clarify the working of the system I will use the output of the discourse model, which contains fully coreferred empty or linguistically unexpressed elements which have gone through pronominal binding process as well as coreference analysis. The first unexpressed element is the subject of the adjunct gerundive headed by KILL in the first sentence: (1) A Kurdish newspaper said Wednesday that Iraqi members of an Al Qaeda-linked group, a Kurd and an Arab, blew themselves up in northern Iraq on February 1, killing at least 105 people. The second unexpressed argument is contained in sentence 2, in the infinitival governed by SUSPECT and headed by CARRY_OUT, which is contained in the coordinate structure headed by SUSPECT, (2) The twin suicide bombing was the deadliest attack in postwar Iraq and was suspected to have been carried out by foreign fighters, possibly linked to Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda network. where the suicide_bombing is predicated as the \"deadliest attack\" in the previous main sentence. The main spatial location now becomes Iraq.

        "This is a copulative structure where the subject MOTIVE is predicated by the infinitival headed by PUNISH.",
        "In fact, this verb is lacking a referential subject simply because the predication prevents it from having a specific one.",
        "The same GROUP is coreferred in the final sentence that contains the most important sequence of unexpressed but yet essential arguments: (5) The newspaper added that bin Mahmud is the brother of man whose alias is Abdullah Al-Shami, an Ansar al-Islam leader who was killed last year while fighting a US-backed onslaught by the PUK that forced the group out of its enclave near the Iranian border at the end of March last year.",

        "It is important to notice that this mention of GROUP is NOT coreferent with the one appearing at the beginning of the text.",
        "This non coreference is clearly apparent from attributes accompanying the head: the first one is expressed as \"an Al Qaeda-linked group\", whereas the second as \"the two Kurdish secular groups\".",
        "In the final computation, the system produces a set of entity pools, that is a set of all referents to a given semantic index - be they properties, entities or relations.",
        "In particular, the referent to the LEADER coincides by virtue of a predication, with Abdullah Al-Shami and has the property of being associated to Ansar al-Islam: from the pool, we now know that he was KILLED, being associated to the THEME_AFFected role.",

        "Another component that is activated at the end of the analysis is sentiment analysis that computes an affective label associated to each markable - if possible - and classifies each markable into three different classes: positive, negative and neutral.",
        "d. The coreference algorithm works as follows: for each markable it check all possible coreference links, at first on the basis only of inherent semantic features, which are: wordform and lemma identity; then semantic similarity measured on the basis of a number of similarity criteria which are lexically based (no statistical measure is used).",

After collecting all possible coreferential relations between semantically validated markables, we then proceed to filter out those links that are inconsistent or incompatible according to three criteria: - first criterion: diverse sentiment polarity - second criterion: different argument structure - third criterion: non related spatiotemporal relations Both argument structure and spatiotemporal relations are collected in the discourse structure which also contains dependence relations expressed by discourse relations in discourse structures; temporal logical relations as computed from an adaptation of Allen's algorithm; and a point of view computed on the basis of presence of ?reportive?",
