        "Most work in NLP on detecting and representing events tacitly adopts a theory of events that can be traced to Donald Davidson.",
        "The advantage of this theory is that it promises to provide a solid foundation for consensus on how to define and individuate events.",
        "But that consensus will be useful for specific domains of application only to the extent that it aligns with the way events are conceptualized in those domains.",
        "In domains where events serve conceptual functions that differ significantly from the ones assumed by that consensus, it may actually retard the development of practical tools.",
        "History is one such domain.",
        "Automatic detection of events and their coreference relations would be a powerful tool for working with and learning from collections of historical texts.",
        "But events as conceptualized by historians differ in significant ways from events as theorized by analytic philosophers.",
        "Rather than attempting to formulate an alternative theory, I instead present a set of high-level requirements for a speculative tool that would benefit from automatic detection of historical events and their coreference relations.",
        "That is, rather than looking for a foundational theory to guide the definition and representation of events, I start by envisioning a useful tool and then try to determine how events would need to be defined and represented in order to create that tool.",
        "The speculative vision I present is a semantic tool for informing users about events in historical discourse.",
        "A semantic tool is any instrument that can inform its users about concepts of interest in some domain, various names or terms associated with those concepts, and relationships among concepts (Hj?rland, 2007).",

        "A semantic tool that informed users about varying and possibly conflicting interpretations of past could be used for orientation.",
        "One may use a map to orient oneself by determining one's own position relative to something else.",
        "The philosopher Jo?rn Ru?sen (2005, 1) has proposed that history is a ?cultural framework of orientation?",
        "in time.",
        "According to Ru?sen, we make the passage of time intelligible through reflecting on our experiences, interpreting and telling stories about them.",
        "Through such interpretation, the otherwise unintelligible passage of time acquires meaning and becomes history.",
        "History orients us in time: it tells us who we are and how we relate to what has come before.",
        "According to Ru?sen's theory, one way that people orient themselves using history is by tracing the kinds of threads White described in his account of contextualism.",
        "Genealogy, or seeking one's origins by tracing back through a web of births and marriages, is a good example of this.",
        "Other examples are stories told of the founding of an institution of which one is a member: the story of how Yahoo!",
        "'s founders started the company in a trailer at Stanford University is regularly recounted to new employees.",
        "These stories directly relate their audiences to historical characters and events, in effect making the audience members characters too.",
        "But, as Ru?sen showed, history does not perform its function of orientation only at this level of direct genealogical relations with the past.",
        "More often, history orients its audience at the level of interpretation, where histories are treated as stories rather than as transparently presenting inferred relations.",
        "For example, historians often allude to historical events as instructive examples for understanding current events.",
        "Consider the historian of early",
        "twenty-first century economic inequality in the U.S., who references the Gilded Age of the late nineteenth century.",
        "He does so not necessarily because he intends to trace causal relations between the earlier period and the later one.",
        "Rather he does so because he wishes to imply that the narrative that presents the best perspective for understanding the current situation is one that has a form similar to a particular, conventionally accepted narrative of the Gilded Age.",
        "He is making an analogy.",
        "While analogies like the one above draw upon conventionally accepted narratives, other histories seek to reorient their audiences by criticizing conventionally accepted narratives.",
        "To a certain extent, nearly every history attempts to do this?if the conventional story were perfectly adequate, why produce a new one?",
        "But certain histories specifically aim to dislodge a dominant narrative and replace it with a new one.",
        "Where analogies with the past appeal to a kind of continuity of form, critical histories try to break that continuity.",
        "Finally, there are histories that try to orient their audiences not by directly linking them into historical narratives, nor by analogizing with or criticizing accepted historical narratives, but by giving accounts of changes in the narratives themselves.",
        "These histories re-establish continuity by portraying a higher-level process of change.",
        "An exemplary case is Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962), in which he posited that discontinuous change in scientific thought is itself a steady factor, something his late twentieth-century readers could use as a reference point for understanding their present situation.",
        "What is important about Ru?sen's typology of history is that it shows how history functions to orient us at the level of discourse and not simply at the level of direct chains of causal relation to the past.",
        "A semantic tool that was intended only to help people understand the past through exploration of the threads among events and characters and their settings would not need to refer to the stories that spun those threads.",
        "But if the tool were intended to help people orient themselves by understanding discourse about the past, it would need to represent not only events and characters and places but also the narratives that emplot them, and relations among these narratives.",

        "A semantic tool intended primarily to provide access to a homogeneous collection of documents, or to enable exploration of a narrowly defined slice of history, might simply summarize a single consensus story of the past.",
        "But a semantic tool for orienting users to a wider historical discourse would need to aid their understanding of the variety of stories told about the past, and to do so it would need to represent not only the contents of those stories?events, characters, settings?but the stories themselves."
