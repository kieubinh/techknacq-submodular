        "Combining natural-language processing (NLP) with computer vision to to generate English descriptions of visual data is an important area of active research (Farhadi et al., 2010; Motwani and Mooney, 2012; Yang et al., 2011).",

        "From a natural-language generation ?Indicates equal contribution (NLG) perspective, this is the content planning stage.",

        "Given the selected SVO triplet, it uses a simple template-based approach to generate candidate sentences which are then ranked using a statistical language model trained on web-scale data to obtain the best overall description.",
        "This is the surface realization stage.",
        "Figure 1 shows sample system output.",
        "Our approach can be viewed as a holistic data-driven three-step process where we first detect objects and activities using state-of-the-art visual recognition algorithms.",
        "Next, we combine these often noisy detections with an estimate of real-world likelihood, which we obtain by mining SVO triplets from large-scale web corpora.",
        "Finally, these triplets are used to generate candidate sentences which are then ranked for plausibility and grammaticality.",
        "The resulting natural-language descriptions can be usefully employed in applications such as semantic video search and summarization, and providing video interpretations for the visually impaired.",
        "Using vision models alone to predict the best subject and object for a given activity is problematic, especially while dealing with challenging real-world YouTube videos as shown in Figures 4 and 5, as it requires a large annotated video corpus of similar SVO triplets (Packer et al., 2012).",
        "We are interested in annotating arbitrary short videos using off-the-shelf visual detectors, without the engineering effort required to build domain-specific activity models.",

        "likelihood of being",
        "the subject/object of a given activity, learned from web-scale text corpora.",
        "For example, animate objects like people and dogs are more likely to be subjects compared to inanimate objects like balls or TV monitors.",
        "Likewise, certain objects are more likely to function as subjects/objects of certain activities, e.g., ?riding a horse?",
        "vs. ?riding a house.?",
        "Selecting the best verb may also require recognizing activities for which no explicit training data has been provided.",

        "is best used to describe a man ?moving?",

        "The WUP-metric evaluation graph is qualitatively similar.",
        "A general trend seems to be that the subject and activity accuracies increase with increasing weights of the NLP score.",
        "There is a significant",
        "improvement in verb accuracy as the NLP weight is increased towards 1.",
        "However, for objects we notice a slight increase in accuracy until the weight for the NLP component is 0.9 after which there is a slight dip.",
        "We hypothesize that this dip is caused by the loss of vision-based information about the objects which provide some guidance for the NLP system.",

        "As previously seen, our method improves verbs far more than it improves subjects or objects.",
        "We hypothesize that the reason we do not achieve a similarly large jump in performance in the MTurk evaluation is because people seem to be more influenced by the object than the verb when both options are partially irrelevant.",
        "For example, in a video of a person riding his bike onto the top of a car, our proposed sentence was ?A person is a riding a motorbike?",
        "while the vision sentence was ?A person plays",

        "events, and these might not agree with the statistics on typical SVOs mined from text corpora.",
        "For instance, the last video in Figure 5 shows a person dragging a cat on the floor.",
        "Since sentences describing people moving or dragging cats around are not common in text corpora, our system actually down-weights the correct interpretation."

        "This paper has introduced a holistic data-driven approach for generating natural-language descriptions of short videos by identifying the best subject-verb-object triplet for describing realistic YouTube videos.",
        "By exploiting knowledge mined from large corpora to determine the likelihood of various SVO combinations, we improve the ability to select the best triplet for describing a video and generate descriptive sentences that are prefered by both automatic and human evaluation.",
        "From our experiments, we see that linguistic knowledge significantly improves activity detection, especially when training and test distributions are very different, one of the advantages of our approach.",
        "Generating more complex sentences with adjectives, adverbs, and multiple objects and multi-sentential descriptions of longer videos with multiple activities are areas for future research."
