        "This paper describes the usage of Natural Language Processing tools, mostly probabilistic topic modeling, to study semantics (word correlations) in a collection of Persian poems consisting of roughly 18k poems from 30 different poets.",
        "For this study, we put a lot of effort in the preprocessing and the development of a large scope lexicon supporting both modern and ancient Persian.",
        "In the analysis step, we obtained very interesting and meaningful results regarding the correlation between poets and topics, their evolution through time, as well as the correlation between the topics and the metre used in the poems.",
        "This work should thus provide valuable results to literature researchers, especially for those working on stylistics or comparative literature."

        "The purpose of this work is to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, among which probabilistic topic models (Buntine, 2002; Blei et al., 2003; Blei, 2012), to study word correlations in a special type of Persian poems called 'Ghazal' (...), one of the most popular Persian poem forms originating in 6th Arabic century.",
        "Ghazal is a poetic form consisting of rhythmic couplets with a rhyming refrain (see Figure 1).",
        "Each couplet consists of two phrases, called hemistichs.",
        "Syllables in all of the hemistichs of a given Ghazal follow the same pattern of heavy and light syllables.",
        "Such a pattern introduces a musical rhythm, called metre.",
        "Metre is one of the most important properties of Persian poems and the reason why usual Persian grammar rules can be violated in poems, especially the order of the parts of speech.",
        "There exist Figure 1: Elements of a typical Ghazal (by Hafez, calligraphed by K. Khoroush).",
        "Note that Persian is right to left in writing.",
        "about 300 metres in Persian poems, 270 of which are rare, the vast majority of poems composed only from 30 metres (Mojiry and Minaei-Bidgoli, 2008).",
        "Ghazal traditionally deals with just one subject, each couplet focusing on one idea.",
        "The words in a couplet are thus very correlated.",
        "However, depending on the rest of the couplets, the message of a couplet could often be interpreted differently due to the many literature techniques that can be found in Ghazals, e.g. metaphors, homonyms, personifica-tion, paradox, alliteration.",
        "For this study, we downloaded from the Gan-joor poems website1, with free permission to use, a Ghazal collection corresponding to 30 poets, from Hakim Sanai (1080) to Rahi Moayyeri (1968), with a total of 17, 939 Ghazals containing about 170, 000 couplets.",
        "The metres, as determined by experts (Shamisa, 2004), are also provided for most poems.",
        "We put a lot of effort into the preprocessing, so as to provide more informative input to the modeling step.",
        "For this, we built a lexicon supporting both modern and ancient Persian, as explained in Section 2.",
        "In addition, we developed several preprocessing tools for Persian and adapted them to poems, as detailed in Section 3.",
        "In the analysis step, exploiting Probabilistic Topic Models (Blei, 2012), promising results were obtained as described in Section 4: strong correlation between poets and topics was found by the model, as well as relevant patterns in the dynamics of the topics over years; good correlation between topics and poem metre was also observed."

        "This section presents the Persian lexicon we built, which supports both modern and ancient Persian words and morphology and provides lemmas for all forms.",
        "This lexicon could thus be useful to many research projects related to both traditional and modern Persian text processing.",
        "Its total size is about 1.8 million terms, including the online version2 of the largest Persian Dictionary today (Dehkhoda, 1963).",
        "This is quite large in comparison with e.g. the morphological lexicon provided by Sagot &Walther (2010), of about 600k terms in total.",
        "2.1 Verbs Taking advantage of the verb root collection provided by Dadegan group (Rasooli et al., 2011), we conjugated all of the regular forms of the Persian verbs which exist in modern Persian using grammars provided by M. R. Bateni (1970), and added them with their root forms (lemmas) to the lexicon.",
        "We also added ancient grammatical forms, referring to ancient grammar books for Persian (Bateni, 1970; P. N. Xanlari, 2009).",
        "Persian verb conjugation seems to be simple: normally each verb has two roots, past and present.",
        "In each conjugated form, the corresponding root comes with some prefixes and attached pronouns in a predefined order.",
        "However, phonological rules introduce some difficulties through so-called mediators.",
        "For instance, the verb ??????",
        "(?r?stan, meaning ?to decorate?",
        "or ?to attire?)",
        "has ???",
        "(?r?)",
        "as present root 2http://www.loghatnaameh.org/.",
        "and ?????",
        "(?r?st) as past root.",
        "Its injunctive form requires it to be preceded by ???",
        "(be), leading to ????",
        "(be?r?).",
        "However, according to phonological rules, when a consonant attaches to ?",
        "(?",
        "), a ??",
        "(y) is introduced as a mediator.",
        "So the correct injunctive form is ?????",
        "(by?r?, ?decorate!?).",
        "Mediators occur mainly when a consonant comes before ?",
        "or when a syllable comes after ?",
        "or ?",
        "(u).",
        "But the problem is slightly more complicated.",
        "For instance, the present verb for ????",
        "(jostan, ?seek- ing?)",
        "is ??",
        "(ju).",
        "Thus when the pronoun ???",
        "(am, ?I?)",
        "is attached, the conjugated form should be ????",
        "(juyam, ?I seek?",
        "), with a mediator.",
        "However, the root ju has also a homograph jav (also written ?? )",
        "which is the present root of ?????",
        "(javidan, ?chew- ing?).",
        "Since here ?",
        "is pronounced v, not u, there is no need for a mediator and the final form is ???",
        "(javam, ?I chew?).",
        "Therefore, naively applying the above mentioned simple rules is wrong and we must proceed more specifically.",
        "To overcome this kind of problem, we studied the related verbs one by one and introduced the necessary exceptions.",
        "In poems, things are becoming even more complicated.",
        "Since metre and rhyme are really key parts of the poem, poets sometimes waives the regular structures and rules in order to save the rhyme or the metre (Tabib, 2005).",
        "For instance, F. Araqi in one of his Ghazals decided to use the verb form ???\u0000???",
        "(mi-n?yi, ?you are not coming?)",
        "which does not follow the mediator rules, as it must be ???\u0000????",
        "(mi- na?yayi).",
        "The poet decided to use the above form, which still makes sense, to preserve the metre.",
        "The problem of mediators aside, the orders of parts in the verb structures are also sometimes changed to preserve the metre/rhyme.",
        "For instance in the future tense, the compound part of compound verbs has normally to come first.",
        "A concrete example is given by the verb ????",
        "?????",
        "???",
        "(j?n x?had sepord means ?",
        "(s)he will give up his spirit and will die?",
        "), which is written by Hafez as: ???",
        "????",
        "?????",
        "(x?had sepord j?n).",
        "To tackle these variations, we included in our lexicon all the alternative formsmen-tioned by Tabib (2005).",
        "As already mentioned, the considered poem collection ranges from 1080 to 1968.",
        "From a linguistics point of view some grammatical structures of the language have changed over this long period of time.",
        "For instance, in ancient Persian the prefix for 24 the continuity of verb was ???",
        "(hami); today only ??",
        "(mi) is used.",
        "Many kinds of changes could be observed when ancient grammars are compared to the modern one.",
        "The relevant structures to the mentioned period of time were extracted from a grammar book of ancient Persian (P. N. Xan?lari, 2009) and included in our lexicon.",
        "Starting from the 4,162 infinitives provided by Dadegan group (Rasooli et al., 2011) and considering ancient grammars, mediators, and properties of poetic forms, we ended up with about 1.6 million different conjugated verb forms.",
        "The underlying new structures have exhaustively been tested by a native Persian graduate student in literature and linguistics.",
        "This validation took about one hundred hours of work, spot-checking all the conjugations for random selected infinitives.",
        "2.2 Other words (than verbs) The verbs aside, we also needed a complete list of other words.",
        "The existing usual Persian electronic lexica were insufficient for our purpose because they are mainly based on newspapers and do not necessarily support ancient words.",
        "For our purpose, the ongoing effort of Dehkhoda Online Dictionary3 looked promising.",
        "Dehkhoda diction-nary (Dehkhoda, 1963) is the largest comprehensive Persian dictionary ever published, comprising 16 volumes (more than 27,000 pages), entailing over 45 years of efforts by Aliakbar Dehkhoda and other experts and it is still ongoing.",
        "The Dehkhoda Online Dictionary Council fortunately approved our request to use their work which currently contains 343,466 entries (for 234,425 distinct forms).",
        "Besides the Dehkhoda Online Dictionary, we added the free Virastyar Persian lexicon4.",
        "Although the is size is one tenth of Dehkhoda?s, it contains several new imported words, not found in Dehkhoda.",
        "All together, we ended up with a lexicon of 246,850 distinct surface forms.",
        "For each surface form, we also provide the list of corresponding roots (lem- mas).",

        "3 Preprocessing Preprocessing is an essential part in NLP which usually plays an important role in the overall performance of the system.",
        "In this work, preprocessing for Persian Ghazals consists of tokenization, normaliza-tion, stemming/lemmatization and filtering.",
        "3.1 Tokenization The purpose of tokenization is to split the poems into word/token sequences.",
        "As an illustration, a hemistich like ?????",
        "?????",
        "????",
        "????",
        "?????",
        "???",
        "is split into the following tokens: ?????",
        "/ ?????",
        "/ ????",
        "/ ????",
        "/ ?????",
        "/ ???.",
        "The tokenization was done using separator characters like white spaces, punctuation, etc.",
        "However, half-spaces made this process quite complicated, as most of them appeared to be ambiguous.",
        "Half-space is a hidden character which avoids preceding letters to be attached to the following letters; the letters in Persian having different glyphs when attached to the preceding letters or not.",
        "For instance, ??\u0000???",
        "(mi-raft, ?was going?",
        "), here written with a half-space separating its two parts,mi (??)",
        "and raft (???)",
        "would be written ?????",
        "without the half-space (notice the difference in the middle).",
        "Half-spaces carry useful information, e.g. for recognizing compound words.",
        "However, they were not reliable enough in the poem collection used.",
        "Themain challenges we had to face related to half-spaces were related to continuous verbs.",
        "In Persian, continuous verbs have a prefixmi (??",
        ")which should be separated from the rest of the verb by a half-space.",
        "However, it was sometimes written using full-spaces and sometimes even without any space at all.",
        "For instance mi-goft (?was saying?)",
        "should be written with a half-space: ??\u0000???",
        "but was sometimes written using a full space: ???",
        "?",
        "?, and even sometimes without any separator: ?????.",
        "The problem of identifying continuous verbs is even more complicated in poems because the prefix (mi) is the homograph of a word meaning ?wine?",
        "(mey: ??",
        "), quite frequent in Persian poems.",
        "For dealing with continuous verbs, we apply the following heuristic: in the structure of continuous verbs, the prefix mi comes before the root of verbs, thus, if a root of a verb comes just after ami, then we 25 can consider it as a continuous verb.",
        "However, many mi's meaning wine would be considered as prefixes using this too simple heuristic, because the most frequent letter in Persian ?",
        "(?)",
        "is also a verb root.",
        "For instance, in phrase mey-e-?sem?ni: ??????",
        "??",
        ",mey means ?wine?",
        "and the second part ??????",
        "means ?re- lated to heaven?",
        "(as an adjective, not a verb).",
        "To consider mi as a prefix, we thus constrained the token after it to start with a root longer than 2 letters.",
        "The mentioned rule improves the process of tok-enization.",
        "However, there are still some cases which are really complicated even for a human to decide.",
        "For instance,mi-?lud: ????",
        "??",
        "(?was polluting?)",
        "and mey-?lud: ????",
        "??",
        "(?polluted with wine?)",
        "are homographs in Persian; whose precise tokenization requires contextual information or even metre to decide which one is more suited.",
        "As a simple solution we can considermey-?lud and any other known compound forms of mey as compound words and add them to our lexicon.",
        "Taking the advantages of this solution for such ambiguous words, we can identify if there is any ambiguity and given that there is some, we can pass all of them to the next processing steps, not deciding too soon.",
        "Continuous verbs aside, present perfect verbs, prefix verbs, and compound verbs have also two parts which might be separated with half-space or full white-space.",
        "For instance, rafteh-am (?have gone?)",
        "might appear with a half-space: ????\u0000?",
        "?\u0000 , without any separator: ?????",
        "?\u0000 , or with a full space: ??",
        "????.",
        "Since the tokenization was complicated and requires linguistic knowledge, especially to properly handle half-spaces, we designed it in two steps: first a basic version to bootstrap the process before character normalization (next subsection), and later a refinement of the basic tokenization, taking advantage of the rich Persian lexicon we built.",
        "As a first tokenization step, we took the advantage of the fact that the number of tokens in a hemistich is intuitively between four and ten, because of Ghazals?",
        "metre rules.",
        "We thus decided that when full-space tokenization had less than four tokens, then both full and half-spaces must be considered as separators.",
        "If the number of tokens obtained this way is more than four, the tokenization is forwarded to the next step.",
        "Otherwise, if there is still less than four tokens, the hemistich is marked for manual checking.",
        "The number of hemistichs that required manual fixation was very low, about 40 out of 340,000.",
        "3.2 Normalization In Persian fonts, several letters have more than one form, because of different writing style related to different pronunciations; for instance ?mrika: ?????",
        "?, emrika: ??????",
        "(?America?",
        "); and of different characters encoding of Arabic letters; for instance an?r (?pomegranate?)",
        "might be written ????",
        "or ????.",
        "We get rid of these meaningless variations by normalizing the characters.",
        "This normalization has to come after basic tokenization because of the unreliable half-spaces, to be handled first, that interfere with the written form of some letters.",
        "We first used both Arabic and Persian normalizers of Lucene5: in the Persian version, most of the cases are considered except different alefs (first letter of Persian alphabet), which are properly handled by the Arabic normalizer.",
        "We furthermore added the following rules to Lucene modules: ?",
        "Normalization for v?v and ye: There are two different forms of v?v: ?or ?",
        ", which is rather Arabic, not preferred in Persian.",
        "For instance, word mo?men (?believer?)",
        "could be written ????",
        "or ????.",
        "We have a similar case with ye which might be written ??",
        "or ??.",
        "For instance, ?yine (?mirror?)",
        "might be written ?????",
        "or ?????.",
        "?",
        "Some characters exist which are optional in Persian writing for instance light vowels, ta?did (sign of emphasis: ?",
        "in ?????",
        "), and tanvins, three signs could be attached at the end of some words, e.g. ?",
        "in ??????",
        ".",
        "Some of themwere implemented in Lucene Arabic normalizer, some in the Persian normalizer and some in none of them.",
        "?",
        "Removal of the optional hamze sign ?",
        "at the end of word, for instance: ?????.",
        "?",
        "Removal (without any change in the meaning) of some Arabic characters that do not normally appear in Persian but were present in the corpus, e.g. ?",
        "(tanvin kasre), ?",
        "(tanvin zamme).",
        "5http://lucene.apache.org/.",
        "26 ?",
        "Removal (without any change in the meaning) of adornment (calligraphy) characters, e.g. dashes, ?",
        "(sokun), and ?",
        "(mad).",
        "As explained in the former subsection, the final tokenization was postponed due to the difficult ambiguities introduced by half-/full-space confusions.",
        "To finalized it after character normalization, taking the advantage of our lexicon, we considered all bi-grams, trigrams and 4-grams of tokens obtained and checked whether they correspond to a valid form in the lexicon.",
        "Out of 2,876,929 tokens, we had 330,644 (valid) bigrams, 12,973 trigrams and 386 4- grams.",
        "3.3 Stemming/Lemmatization The purpose of stemming/lemmatization6 is to regroup (using the same writing) words of similar root, in order to reduce (hopefully the non-significant part of) the variability of the documents processed.",
        "Although a free Persian stemmer PerStem exists (Jadidinejad et al., 2009)7, its limitations we observed (see below) encouraged us to build our own stemmer.",
        "Since Persian is an affixive language, lemmatization is achieved by removing plural signs, attached pronouns, prefixes and suffixes to obtain the root.",
        "We thus collected a list of these and enriched it using affixes provided by Adib Tousi (1974) and by Tabtabai (2007).",
        "Then we designed a flowchart to iteratively remove the unwanted parts from the normalized token until we get a simple word contained in the lexicon or a word with a length of less than 4 letters.",
        "The experiences showed us it is more appropriate to remove prefixes first, then suffixes.",
        "Even in suffix removal, the removal order is a crucial issue.",
        "Since some words have more than one suffix and the set of suffixes is not a prefix-free set, a wrong removal order can leads to removing a wrong suffix and might result in finishing the removal too early, where there still exist some letters to be removed.",
        "For instance, the word ??????????",
        "(ket?bh?ye?",
        "?n, ?their books?)",
        "should be reduced 6Stemming reduces words to their stems, using rather crude algorithms and basic morphological rules, while lemmatization uses more advanced morphological analysis and lexical resources to find the root form, named lemma.",
        "7http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~jonsafari/ persian_nlp.html.",
        "to ????",
        "(ket?b, ?book?).",
        "It has three suffixes ??",
        "(h?, plural marker), ?",
        "(ye, mediator) and ???",
        "(?an, ?their?",
        "as a attached pronoun).",
        "However, ?an has two prefixes which are also suffixes: ?",
        "(N, infinitive mark) and ??",
        "(?n, plural mark for nouns).",
        "Such cases are not considered in PerStem, and the affixes removal is stopped too early.",
        "In order to overcome this problem in our stemmer, we generated all of the possible combinations of affixes and add them to our affixes collection.",
        "Then the largest possible one is removed from the token at each step.",
        "We then checked for the term in the lexicon and return its lemmas when matched.",
        "If we could not find any matched term in the lexicon, we manually check the token.",
        "Doing so, we realized that because of the missing/wrong spaces, most of these tokens wrongly attached to conjunctions.",
        "For this specific purpose, we partially modified the list of affixes and applied the stemmer again on these out of vocabulary forms, ending up with the proper information.",
        "In the case of homographs, for instance ?????",
        "that could be read as ne?asti (?you sat?)",
        "or as na?osti (?you did not wash?",
        "), we pass all possible interpretations to the next processing step.",
        "For instance, the result of the lemmatization of ?????",
        "is ?",
        "?to sit?",
        "or ?to wash?",
        "?, i.e. both lemmas.",
        "3.4 Filtering In order to reduce even further the input variabil-ity, some filtering has been performed based both on frequencies and on a standard list of ?stop-words?, some extremely common words which are normally meaningless (at least independently).",
        "The general strategy for determining stop-words is to sort the terms by their frequencies in the collec-tion, consider the most frequent ones and then filter themmanually with respect to the domain.",
        "Doing so, we found stop-words well suited for the poem collection considered, which is slightly different from stop-words in normal Persian text (poem specific, and typographical error occurred in the corpus used).",
        "We also combined this set with a (manually chosen) subset of stop-words provided by K. Taghva (2003).",
