        "Statistics show that between 1997 and 2009 the number of ELLs enrolled in U.S. public schools has increased by 51% (National Clearinghouse for Language Acquisition, 2011).",
        "ELLs who have lower literacy skills, and who are reading below grade level may be mainstreamed into regular content-area classrooms, and may not receive supplemental English language instruction.",
        "Unfortunately, K-12 content-area teachers1 are less likely to be trained to adapt their instructional approaches to accommodate the diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds of students with varying levels of English proficiency (Adger, Snow, & Christian, 2002; Calder?n, August, Slavin, Cheun, Dur?n, & Madden, 2005; Rivera, Moughamian, Lesaux, & Francis, 2008; Walqui & Heritage, 2012).",
        "This situation motivated the development of Language MuseSM, a web-based application designed to offer teacher professional development (TPD) for content-area teachers to support their understanding of potential sources of linguistic unfamiliarity that may obscure text content for ELLs, and their ability to develop relevant language-based instructional scaffolding.",
        "We reasoned that prerequisite to effectively planning or implementing instructional supports for ELLs, teachers first needed to be able to recognize potential sources of linguistic difficulty.",
        "Further, teachers might need training about the specific linguistic structures that might be unfamiliar to learners, and which might lead to learners?",
        "inaccessibility to core content in text.",
        "The motivation for Language Muse, thus, grew from the need to provide teachers with training about linguistic features in texts that may be unfamiliar to learners.",
        "In complement to training videos and reading resources, Language Muse contains a module that provides automated and explicit linguistic feedback for texts, and is intend1 These are Kindergarten-12th grade teachers of subject areas, including math, science, social studies, and English language arts.",
        "ed to support teachers in the development of lesson plans with language-based instructional activities and assessments to support reading and content comprehension of texts.",
        "The linguistic feedback module uses various natural language processing methods to provide feedback at the vocabulary, phrasal, sentential, and discourse levels.",
        "Another motivation of application was efficiency.",
        "Even with a strong linguistic awareness, manual identification of linguistic features would be a very time-consuming process.",
        "Outcomes from pre-post teacher assessments delivered through user piloting with teachers indicated that teachers who used Language Muse showed gains in linguistic knowledge.",

        "Language Demands on ELLs.",
        "The English Language Arts Common Core State Standards2 (Standards) (NGA Center & CCSSO, 2010) has now been adopted by 46 states and is a trendsetter in U.S. education.",
        "The Standards emphasize the need for all learners (including ELLs3) to read progressively more complex texts across multiple genres in the content areas, preparing learners for college and careers.",
        "To accomplish this, learners must have familiarity with numerous linguistic features related to vocabulary, English language",
        "structures, and a variety of text structures (discourse).",
        "In terms of vocabulary demands, research reports on investigations of academic vocabulary and the Tier word system (Beck, McKeown, & Kucan, 2008; Calder?n, 2007).",
        "Specifically, Tier 1 words are those used in everyday conversation; Tier 2 words are general academic words; and Tier 3 words are found in specific domains (Beck et al. 2008; Coleman & Pimental, 2011a).",
        "All three Tiers are necessary to academic content learning.",
        "Key content-area terms in any text would include the vocabulary that students are expected to learn regardless of the Tier.",
        "However, there are many other vocabulary terms in the same text that may or may not be key content, but may still pose difficulties for an ELL reader.",
        "For instance, the phrase ?rock star?",
        "is a figurative term whose meaning is not obvious from knowing the various meanings of ?rock?",
        "or ?star?.",
        "A deficit in morphological awareness can be a source of reading comprehension difficulties among native speakers of English, (Berninger, Abbott, Nagy, & Carlisle, 2009; Nagy, Berninger, & Abbot, 2006), but even more so among ELLs (Carlo, August, McLaughlin, Snow, Dressler, Lippmann, & White, 2004; Kieffer & Lesaux, 2008).",
        "Teaching morphological structure has been shown to be effective with ELLs (Lesaux, Kieffer, Faller, & Kelley, 2010; Proctor, Dalton, Uccelli, Biancarosa, Snow, & Neugebauer, 2011).",
        "Native language support can also aid students in learning text-based content (Francis, August, Goldenberg, & Shanahan, 2004).",
        "Specifically, lessons that incorporate cognates (e.g., individual (English) and individuo (Spanish)) have been found to be effective in expanding English vocabulary development and aiding in comprehension (August, 2003; Proctor, Dalton, & Grisham, 2007).",
        "Polysemous words can contribute to overall text difficulty.",
        "Papamihiel, Lake & Rice (2005) specifically discuss difficulties of content-specific, polysemous words, where the more common meaning may lead to a misconception when using that meaning to infer the more specific content meaning (e.g., prime in prime numbers).",
        "Unfamiliar cultural references (e.g., He's a member of the Senate.",
        "), when reading an unfamiliar language to learn unfamiliar content, imposes a triple cognitive load for ELLs (Goldenberg, 2008).",
        "With regard to sentence-level demands, long, multi-clause sentences can present frustrating",
        "complexities.",
        "Readers need to analyze sentence clauses to understand and encode key information in working memory as they build a coherent mental model of the meaning of a text (Kintsch, 1998).",
        "Different subject areas often have sentential and phrasal structures that are unique to that subject, resulting in comprehension breakdowns, e.g., the noun phrases in math texts ?a number which can be divided by itself ??",
        "(Schleppegrell, 2007; Schleppegrell & de Oliveira, 2006).",
        "Regarding discourse structure demands, content-area texts may represent varying discourse relationships.",
        "Discourse relations such as, compare-contrast, cause-effect can all be intermingled within a single passage (Goldman & Rakestraw, 2000; Meyer, 2003).",
        "Teachers need to learn how to identify discourse-level information and develop scaffolding to support students?",
        "ability to navigate discourse elements in texts.",
        "Students may also be challenged in keeping track of and resolving referential (anaphoric) relationships.",
        "Pronomial reference can be a challenge for ELLs in texts with multiple characters or agents (Kral, 2004).",
        "An equal challenge concerns the resolution of referential relations among nouns, phrases, or ideas - a common occurrence in expository texts-whether the category of reference is pronominal, synonymy, paraphrase, or determiner, e.g., this, that, or those (Pretorius, 2005).",
        "Also critical to learning new content is understanding connector words functions (e.g., because, therefore) for building text cohesion (Goldman & Murray, 1992; Graesser, McNamara, & Louwerse, 2003).",
        "Teacher Training.",
        "Teachers need to become linguistically aware of aspects of the English language that present potential obstacles to content access for ELLs.",
        "Yet, teachers often lack training in the identification of features of English that may challenge diverse groups of ELLs (Adger et al., 2002; Calder?n et al., 2005; Rivera et al., 2008; Walqui & Heritage, 2012), and in the implementation of strategies to help ELLs academic language and vocabulary acquisition (Flinspach, Scott, Miller, Samway, & Vevea, 2008).",
        "Further, the number of teachers trained in effective instructional strategies to meet the range of needs of ELLs has not increased consistently with the rate of the ELL population (G?ndara, Maxwell-Jolly, & Driscoll, 2005; Green, Foote, Walker & Shuman, 2010).",
        "Studies suggest that teachers with specialized training have a positive impact on student performance (Darling-Hammond, 2000; Peske & Haycock, 2006)."

        "Study outcomes indicated that the teacher professional development package can be successfully implemented in the context of in-service, post-secondary course work.",
        "Through a study with a TPD program at Stanford University, results of the pre-post assessments administered in the study indicated at statistically-significant levels that teachers did improve their linguistic knowledge about vocabulary, sentences relations, and discourse relations, and that they also demonstrated and increased ability to offer language-based scaffolding strategies as evidenced by an gains pre-post total score on the CR.",

        "The Language Muse TPD package is now being evaluated with nine middle-school teachers with high populations of ELLs in California, New Jersey, and Texas.",
        "After completion of the TPD, teachers will develop lesson units using Language Muse, and administer the lessons in their classrooms.",
        "Pre- and post-tests will be administered to students to evaluate the effectiveness of the lesson plans vis-?-vis language-based instruction."
