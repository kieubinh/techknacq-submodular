        "In this paper we presented three semantic components to aid ASD people to understand the texts.",
        "The Image Component finds, disambiguates and assigns Images to difficult terms in the text or related to the text.",
        "It works in two modes: automated or on-demand.",
        "In the automated mode a document is automatically enriched with images.",
        "In the on-demand mode the user highlights the concepts (s)he considers difficult and the web service retrieves the corresponding images.",
        "Further development of this component will involve disambiguation against Wikipedia and retrieval of images from the corresponding articles.",
        "The Idiom Component finds idioms and other figurative language expressions in the user documents and provides definitions for them.",
        "Further versions of the component will go beyond simple matching and will identify other categories of figurative language.",
        "The Topic Models component helps organizing the repository collection by computing topics for the user documents.",
        "Moreover it also offers a summarization of the document before the actual reading experience.",
        "Finally the Personalization component adapts the system output to the user experience.",
        "Future versions of the component will define dynamic user profiles in addition to the static user profiles in the current version.",
        "Our hope is that the Open Book tool will be useful for other parts of populations that have difficulties with syntactic constructions or semantic processing, too."
