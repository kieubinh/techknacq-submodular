        "These kinds of transformations are different from those used by other systems, which rely only on syntactic transformations or only on lexical substitutions.",
        "Rules are purpose-specific and focused on numerical expressions.",
        "With this kind of transformations the readability of the text improves in spite of the fact that the resulting syntactic structure of the numerical expression is more complicated, due to the possible presence of hedges.",
        "For example, for a original numerical expression like ?25.9%?",
        "the system generates the simplified ?more than a quarter?",
        "which is easier to understand even though longer and syntactically more complex.",
        "With respect to coverage of different types of numerical expressions, this system does not consider ratios as a possible simplification strategy because the proportion approximation program does not use them as candidates to simplify a proportion.",
        "This possibility should be explored in the future.",
        "Another observation is that the system does not consider the context of the sentence in which the numerical expression occurs.",
        "For example, if the sentence makes a comparison between two numerical expressions that the system rounded to the same value, the original meaning is lost.",
        "One example of this case is the following sentence from the corpus: ?One in four children were awarded A grades (25.9%, up from 25.3% last year)?.",
        "Both percentages ?25.9%?",
        "and ?25.3%?",
        "are simplified by the system using ?around 1/4?",
        "and the meaning of the sentence is lost.",
        "Thus we should consider the role of context (the set of numerical expressions in a given sentence as a whole and the meaning of the text) in establishing what simplifications must be used.",
        "6 Conforming with conclusions of prior surveys The results presented for the system are evaluated in this section for conformance with the conclusions resulting from the empirical studies described in (Bautista et al., 2011b) and (Bautista et al., 2011a).",
        "With respect to the preference for round or common values in simplification (Conclusion 1), the system presented conforms to this preference by virtue of the way in which the list of candidate substitutions is produced by the program.",
        "The candidates returned by the program are already restricted to common values of percentages (rounded up) and fractions, so the decision to consider as preferred candidate the one listed first implicitly applies the criteria that leads to this behavior.",
        "With respect to the need to treat differently values in the extreme or central ranges of proportion (Conclusion 2), the system addresses this need by virtue of the actual set of candidates produced by the program in each case.",
        "For example, if the original expression is a extreme value like ?0.972?, the program produces a different candidate substitution (?almost all?)",
        "that in the central ranges is not considered.",
        "With respect to restricting the use of hedges to situations where loss of precision is incurred (Conclusion 3), the hedge choice rules applied by the system (see Table 1) satisfy this restriction.",
        "When Vr=Vmg hedges are included in the simplified expression only if they were already present in the original expression.",
        "In addition, the system rounds up any quantities with decimal positions to the nearest whole number whenever the decimal positions are lost during simplification.",
        "This functionality is provided implicitly by the program, which presents the rounded up version as the next option immediately following the alternative which includes the decimal positions.",
        "For example, if the input proportion is ?0.198?, some rounded candidate substitutions are calculated as ?almost 20%?",
        "or ?less than 20%?.",
        "Finally, the system follows the European guidelines for the production of easy to read information in that it automatically replaces numerical quantities expressed in words with the corresponding quantity expressed in digits."

        "The system described in this paper constitutes a first approximation to the task of simplifying numerical expressions in a text to varying degrees of difficulty.",
        "The definition of an scale of difficulty of numerical expressions, the identification of rules governing the selection of candidate substitution and the application of hedges constitute important contributions.",
        "The empirical evaluation of the system with human experts results in acceptable rates of agreement.",
        "The behavior of the system conforms to the conclusions on simplification strategies as applied by humans resulting from previous empirical surveys.",
        "There are different aspects to improve the actual system from the data collected, with a special attention to cases in which the experts disagree.",
        "As future work, the syntactic context should be considered to simplify numerical expression, extending the kind of proportion to simplify and treating special cases analyzed in this first version.",
        "At the syntactic level, some transformation rules can be implemented from a syntactic analysis.",
        "It is important that the meaning of the sentences be preserved regardless of whether part of the sentence is deleted or rewritten by the adaptation rules.",
        "In addition, the numerical expression parser and the proportion approximation program could also be studied in order to evaluate the impact of their errors in the final performance.",
        "Our final aim is to develop an automatic simplification system in a broader sense, possibly including more complex operations like syntactic transformations of the structure of the input text, or lexical substitution to reduce the complexity of the vocabulary employed in the text.",
        "Additionally we hope to develop versions of the simplification system for other languages, starting with Spanish.",
        "Probably the simplification strategies for numbers would be the same but the use of hedge modifiers may be different."
