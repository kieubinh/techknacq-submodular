        "The increasing popularity of social media has given birth to new genres of text that have been the focus of NLP research for applications such as event discovery (Benson et al., 2011), election outcome prediction (Tumasjan et al., 2011; Bermingham and Smeaton, 2011), user profile classification (De Choudhury et al., 2012), conversation model-ing (Ritter et al., 2010), consumer insight discovery (Chamlertwat et al., 2012), etc.",
        "A hallmark of social media is that people tend to share their personal feelings, often in publicly visible forums.",
        "As a result, social media has also been the focus of NLP research on sentiment analysis (Kouloumpis et al., 2011), emotion classification and lexicon generation (Mohammad, 2012), and sarcasm detection (Davi-dov et al., 2010).",
        "Identifying emotion in social media text could be beneficial for many application areas, for example to help companies understand how people feel about their products, to assist governments in recognizing growing anger or fear associated with an event, and to help media outlets understand the public's emotional response toward controversial issues or international affairs.",
        "Twitter, a micro-blogging platform, is particularly well-known for its use by people who like to instantly express thoughts within a limited length of 140 characters.",
        "These status updates, known as tweets, are often emotional.",
        "Hashtags are a distinctive characteristic of tweets, which are a community-created convention for providing meta-information about a tweet.",
        "Hashtags are created by adding the ?#?",
        "symbol as a prefix to a word or a multi-word phrase that consists of concatenated words without whites-pace (e.g., #welovehashtags).",
        "People use hashtags in many ways, for example to represent the topic of a tweet (e.g., #graduation), to convey additional information (e.g., #mybirthdaytoday), or to express an emotion (e.g., #pissedoff).",
        "The usage of hashtags in tweets is common, as reflected in the study of a sample of 0.6 million tweets by Wang et al. (2011) which found that 14.6% of tweets in their sample had at least one hashtag.",
        "In tweets that express emotion, it is common to find hashtags representing the emotion felt by the tweeter, such as ?the new iphone is a waste of money!",
        "nothing new!",
        "#angry?",
        "denoting anger or ?buying a new sweater for my mom for her birthday!",
        "#loveyoumom?",
        "denoting affection.",
        "Identifying the emotion conveyed by a hashtag has not yet been studied by the natural language processing community.",
        "The goal of our research is to automatically identify hashtags that express one of five emotions: affection, anger/rage, fear/anxiety, joy, or sadness/disappointment.",
        "The learned hashtags are then used to recognize tweets that express one of these emotions.",
        "We use a bootstrapping approach that begins with 5 seed hashtags for each emotion class and iteratively learns more hashtags from unlabeled tweets.",
        "We show that the learned hashtags can accurately identify tweets that convey emotion and yield additional coverage beyond the recall of an N-gram classifier.",
        "The rest of the paper is divided into the following sections.",
        "In Section 2, we present a brief overview of previous research related to emotion classification in social media and the use of hashtags.",
        "In Section 3, we describe our bootstrapping approach for learning lists of emotion hashtags.",
        "In Section 4 we discuss the data collection process and our experimental design.",
        "In Section 5, we present the results of our experiments.",
        "Finally, we conclude by summarizing our findings and presenting directions for future work."

        "In cases where hashtags were used to collect training data, the hashtags were manually selected for each emotion class.",

        "However, their work is focused on classifying hashtags of positive and negative sentiment polarities, and they made use of sentiment polarity of the individual tweets to classify hashtag sentiments.",
        "On the contrary, we learn emotion hashtags and use the learned hashtag lists to classify emotion tweets.",

        "The hashtags that people use in tweets are often very creative.",

        "People also use elongated1 forms of words (e.g., #yaaaaay, #goawaaay) to put emphasis on their emotional state.",
        "In addition, words are often spelled creatively by replacing a word with a number or replacing some characters with phonetically similar characters (e.g., #only4you, #YoureDaBest).",

        "We see both types of feature representations of the hashtag lists improve precision and recall across all emotion classes over the N-gram classifier baselines.",
        "Using the union of the classifier and list lookup, we see a 12% recall gain with only 2% precision drop in micro-average over the unigram baseline, and 15% recall gain with only 2% precision drop in macro-average.",
        "As a result, we see an overall 8% micro-average F-measure improvement and 9% macro-average F-measure improvement.",
        "In Table 6, we show the top 20 hashtags learned in each emotion class by our bootstrapped learning.",
        "While many of these hashtags express emotion, we also notice a few hashtags representing reasons (e.g., #baddriver in FEAR/ANXIETY) that are strongly associated with the corresponding emotion, as well as common misspellings (e.g., #exicted in JOY)."

      "text": [
        "In this research we have presented a bootstrapped learning framework to automatically learn emotion hashtags.",
        "Our approach makes use of supervision from seed hashtag labeled tweets, and through a bootstrapping process, iteratively learns emotion hashtags.",
        "We have experimented with several approaches to use the lists of emotion hashtags for emotion classification and have found that the hashtag lists consistently improve emotion classification performance in tweets.",
        "In future research, since our bootstrapped learning approach does not rely on any language specific techniques, we plan to learn emotion hashtags in other prominent languages such as Spanish, Portuguese, etc."
