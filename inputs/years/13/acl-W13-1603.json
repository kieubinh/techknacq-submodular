        "Social media platforms such as Twitter.com have become a common way for people to share opinions and emotions.",
        "Sports events are traditionally accompanied by strong emotions and the 2012 summer Olympic Games in London were not an exception.",
        "In this paper we describe methods to analyze and data mine the emotional content of tweets about this",
        "event using human computation.",
        "Our goal is to create an emotion recognition method, capable of classifying domain specific emotions with a high emotion granularity.",
        "In the stated case, domain specificity refers not only to the sport event, but also to the Twitter environment.",
        "We focus on the categorical representation of emotions because it allows a more fine-grained analysis and it is more natural for humans.",
        "In daily life we use emotion names to describe specific feelings rather than give numerical evaluations or specify polarity.",
        "So far, the multi-item emotion classification problem has received much less attention.",
        "One reason is that high quality training corpora are difficult to construct largely due to the cost of human annotators.",
        "Further, if emotion representation is not carefully designed, the annotator agreement can be very low.",
        "The higher the number of considered emotions is, the more difficult it is for humans to agree on a label for a given text.",
        "Low quality labeling leads to difficulties in extracting powerful classification features.",
        "This problem is further compounded in parsimonious environments, like Twitter, where the short text leads to a lack of emotional cues.",
        "All this presents challenges in developing a high-quality emotion recognition system operating with a fine-grained emotion category set within a chosen domain.",
        "In this paper, we show how to tackle the above challenges through human computation, using an online labor market such as the Amazon Mechanical Turk or AMT (Snow et al., 2008).",
        "To overcome the possible difficulties in annotation we employ a well-designed emotion assessment tool, the Geneva",
        "Emotion Wheel (GEW) (Scherer, 2005).",
        "Having 20 separate emotion categories, it provides a desirable high level of emotion granularity.",
        "In a given task, we show the annotators the tweets, related to the aforementioned sports event, and ask them to classify the tweets?",
        "emotional content into one of the provided emotion categories.",
        "The action sequence requires them to both label the tweets and to specify the textual constructs that support their decision.",
        "We view the selected textual constructs as probable classification features.",
        "The proposed method thus simultaneously produces an emotion annotated corpus of tweets and creates an emotion lexicon.",
        "The resulting weighted emotion lexicon is a list of phrases indicative of emotion presence.",
        "It consists solely of ones selected by respondents, while their weights were learnt based on their occurrence in the constructed Sports-Related Emotion Corpus (SREC).",
        "We show that the human-based lexicon is well suited for the particularities of the chosen environment, and also for an emotion model with a high number of categories.",
        "Firstly, we show that domain specificity matters, and that non-specialists, using their common sense, can extract features that are useful in classification.",
        "We use the resulting lexicon, OlympLex, in a binary polarity classification problem on the domain data and show that it outperforms several traditional lexicons.",
        "In multi-emotion classification, we show that it is highly accurate in classifying tweets into 20 emotion categories of the Geneva Emotion Wheel (GEW) (Scherer, 2005).",
        "As a baseline for comparison we use the Geneva wheel compatible lexicon, the Geneva Affect Label Coder (GALC) (Scherer, 2005).",
        "The experiments show that OlympLex significantly outperforms this baseline.",
        "Such a detailed emotion representation allows us to create an accurate description of the sentiment the chosen event evokes in its viewers.",
        "For instance, we find that Pride is the dominant emotion, and that it is 2.3 times more prevalent than Anger."

        "work we used the emotion categories from the Geneva Emotion Wheel (GEW, version 2.0).",
        "GEW was developed as a tool for obtaining self-reports of emotional experience with a goal to structure the exhaustive list of possible emotion names used in free-format self-reports with minimal loss in expressibility.",
        "It presents 20 (10 positive/10 negative) emotion categories frequently answered in free-format self-reports as main options.",
        "Each emotion category is represented by two common emotion names to emphasize its family nature (e.g. Happiness/Joy3).",
        "These categories are arranged on the circle following the underlying 2-dimensional space of valence (positive-negative) and control (high-low).",
        "Several levels of intensity for each emotion category are presented as answer options.",
        "Also, 2 other answers are possible: No emotion and Other emotion with free-format input in the latter case.",
        "Compared to raw dimensional models where emotion states are described as points in space (e.g. Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance model, PAD (Mehra-bian, 1996)) GEW has an advantage of categorical representation where emotion state is described in terms of discrete set of emotion names.",
        "It allows humans to measure their emotions in terms of emotion names they accustomed to instead of unnatural numerical measurements.",
        "Among commonly used emotion categories sets GEW categories are the most fine-grained, compared, for instance, to Ek-man's (1992) or Plutchik's (1980) basic emotions.",
        "While these models have been popular in emotion recognition research, their main shortcoming is their limited items.",
        "In sports events, fans and spectators not only feel strong emotions, but also likely want to express them in multitudes of expressions.",
        "Pride/Elation, Envy/Jealousy are just two examples that are missed in those models with basic emotions.",
        "Lexical Resources Emotion recognition is closely related to the positive/negative sentiment classification.",
        "In a traditional approach the units defining the polarity of the text are polarity-bearing terms.",
        "A list of such terms with corresponding polarity label or score forms a polarity lexicon.",
        "Commonly used examples of polarity lexicons include GI (Stone et al., 1968), Bing Liu's lexicon (Hu and Liu, 2004), and OpinionFinder (Wilson et al., 2009).",
        "Similarly, emotion lexicons can be defined as lists of terms bearing emotions with their corre",
        "sponding emotion information.",
        "Depending on the construction methods, they can be separated into those that constructed manually (GALC (Scherer, 2005)), semi-automatically (WordNet-Affect (Strap-parava and Valitutti, 2004)) or via human computation (ANEW (Bradley and Lang, 1999), NRC (Mo-hammad and Turney, 2010; Mohammad and Turney, 2012)).",
        "Our work is most closely related to the NRC lexicon which was also extracted via human computation on AMT.",
        "The authors developed a task where, for a given term, the annotators rated to what extent the term is associated to each emotion of Plutchik's set.",
        "In contrast, in our work, we harvest emotional labels and features in context.",
        "The terms are associated with emotions in the context of the tweet they appear in.",
        "We use the approach suggested by (Aman and Szpakowicz, 2007) where humans are asked to select an excerpt of the text expressing emotion.",
        "Moreover, we ask the annotators for additional interchangeable, emotional expressions for the same situation.",
        "Lexicons obtained from unsupervised learning methods using automatically annotated Twitter data (Mohammad, 2012) have also been proposed, but their performance has been shown to be inferior to benchmarks such as NRC.",
        "The underlying emotion representation model differs from one emotion lexicon to another.",
        "For instance, ANEW uses the PAD dimensions, Plutchik's basic categories are used by NRC and Ekman's categories in WordNet-Affect.",
        "However, such representations do not provide a sufficient emotion granularity level.",
        "There is only one lexicon which incorporates GEW emotion model: the GALC (Scherer, 2005) lexicon.",
        "It contains 279 unigram stems (e.g. happ*) explicitly expressing one of 36 emotion categories (covering all GEW categories).",
        "We use therefore this lexicon for benchmarking.",
        "The main differences of our lexicon compared to its predecessors lie in the usage of new fine-grained emotion set, new methods of human computation employed in its construction and specificity to the context of Twitter posts and sport-related emotions."

        "Multi-label Evaluation We used the standard evaluation metrics adapted for multi-label output (Tsoumakas and Katakis, 2007).",
        "For each tweet, we first computed the precision P = |OC?OT ||OC |, which shows how many of emotions outputted by the classifier were correct.",
        "Then the recall R = |OC?OT ||OT |, which shows how many of true labels were found by classifier, and the accuracy A = |OC?OT ||OC?OT |, which shows how close the sets of classifier and true labels were.",
        "These values were averaged among all applicable tweets.",
        "For precision and recall we used only the tweets with non-neutral answers in OC and OT correspondingly (meaning that No emotion label was not present in a set).",
        "Table 3 shows the comparative results of our and GALC lexicons.",
        "Compared to the GALC baseline, our classifier has both higher precision and recall.",
        "Higher recall is explained by the fact that our lexicon is larger and contains also ngram terms.",
        "In addition, it includes not only explicit emotion expressions (e.g. sad or proud), but also implicit ones (e.g. yes or mistakes).",
        "Per-Category Evaluation Another way to evaluate the output of multi-label classifier is to evaluate it for each emotion category separately.",
        "For each category we computed precision, recall and F1-score.",

        "We presented a context-aware human computation method for emotion labeling and feature extraction.",

        "The suggested method can be reused to construct additional lexicons for different domains.",
        "An important aspect that differentiates our work is the emotion granularity.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this was the first attempt to create lexical resources for emotion classification based on the Geneva Emotion Wheel (GEW), which has as many as 20 emotion categories.",
        "This level of granularity enabled us to capture the subtleties of the emotional responses in the target domain, tweets regarding the 2012 summer Olympics in London.",
        "In this dataset, we found that the prevalent emotion is Pride, a detail which is unattainable using previous methods.",
        "Another differentiator is that, unlike most previous approaches, we relied on human computation for both labeling and feature extraction tasks.",
        "We showed that human generated features can be successfully used in emotional classification, outperforming various existing methods.",
        "A further difference from prior lexicons is the fact that ours was built with a context-sensitive method.",
        "This led to a higher accuracy on the target domain, compared to the general purpose lexicon.",
        "We benchmarked the cross-validated version of created OlympLex lexicon with the existing universal-domain lexicons for both polarity and multi-emotion problems.",
        "In suggested settings we showed that it can outperform general purpose lexicons in the binary classification due to its domain specificity.",
        "We also obtained significant improvements over the baseline GALC lexicon, which was the only preexisting one compatible with the GEW.",
        "However, high domain specificity of the created lexicon and restricted variety of data used in its construction implies possible limitations of its usage for other types of data.",
        "Its porting and generalization to other domains is one of the future directions."
