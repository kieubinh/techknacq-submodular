        "All words in this lexicon were originally rated by 200 na?",

        "Whissell's DAL has subsequently been used in diverse research fields, for example as a keystone for sentiment analysis in written text (Yi et al., 2003, e.g.) and emotion recognition in spoken language (Cowie et al., 2001).",
        "DAL has also been used to aid the selection of emotionally balanced word stimuli for Neuroscience and Psycholinguistics experiments (Gray et al., 2002).",
        "Given the widespread impact of DAL for the English language, it would be desirable to create similar lexicons for other languages.",
        "In recent years, there have been efforts to build cross-lingual resources, such as using sentiment analysis tools in English to score Spanish texts after performing machine translation (Brooke et al., 2009) or to automatically derive sentiment lexicons in Spanish (Pe?rez-Rosas et al., 2012).",
        "The purpose of the present work is to create a manually annotated lexicon for the Spanish language, replicating Whissell's DAL, aiming at alleviating the scarcity of resources for the Spanish language, and at determining if the lexicon-based approach would work in Spanish as well as it does in English.",
        "We leave for future work the comparison of the different approaches mentioned here.",
        "This paper describes the three steps performed to accomplish that goal: i) creating a knowledge base which is likely to have a good word coverage on arbitrary texts from any topic and genre (Section 2); ii) having a number of volunteers annotate each word for the three affective dimensions under study (Section 3); and iii) evaluating the usefulness of our knowledge base on simple tasks (Section 4)."

        "In this work we presented a knowledge base of Spanish words labeled by human volunteers for three affective dimensions ?",
        "pleasantness, activation and imagery, inspired by the English DAL created by Whissell (1986; 1989).",
        "The annotations of these three dimensions were weakly intercorrelated, indicating a high level of independence of each other.",
        "Additionally, the agreement between volunteers was quite high, especially for pleasantness and activation, given the subjectivity of the labeling task.",
        "To evaluate the usefulness of our lexicon, we built a simple emotion prediction system.",
        "When used for predicting the same three dimensions on new texts, its output significantly correlated with human judgments for pleasantness and activation, but the results",
        "for imagery were not satisfactory.",
        "Also, when used for classifying the opinion polarity of user product reviews, the system managed to achieve an accuracy better than random.",
        "These results suggest that our knowledge base successfully captured useful information of human perception of, at least, pleasantness and activation.",
        "For imagery, either it failed to capture any significant information, or the system we created was too simple to exploit it accordingly.",
        "Regarding the evolution of the system's performance as a function of the size of the lexicon, the results were clear.",
        "When more words were included, the system performance increased only at a logarithmic pace.",
        "Thus, working on more complex systems seems to be more promising than adding more human-annotated words.",
        "In summary, this work presented a knowledge base that may come handy to researchers and developers of sentiment analysis tools in Spanish.",
        "Additionally, it may be useful for disciplines that need to select emotionally balanced word stimuli, such as Neuroscience or Psycholinguistics.",
        "In future work we will compare the usefulness of our manually annotated lexicon and cross-linguistic approaches (Brooke et al., 2009; Pe?rez-Rosas et al., 2012)."
