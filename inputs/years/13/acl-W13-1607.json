        "We focus on the detection of sexual predators in chat rooms, among the many cyber-menaces targeting children.",
        "This is indeed a critical problem because most sexually-abused children have agreed voluntarily to met with their abuser (Wolak et al., 2006).",
        "Therefore, anticipatively detecting when a person attempts to approach a children, with malicious intentions, could reduce the number of abused children.",
        "Traditionally, a term that is used to describe malicious actions with a potential aim of sexual exploitation or emotional connection with a child is referred as ?Child Grooming?",
        "or ?Grooming Attack?",
        "(Ku-cukyilmaz et al., 2008).",

        "(e.g. physical sexual molestation).",
        "The usual approach1 to catch sexual predators is through police officers or volunteers, whom behave as fake children in chat rooms and provoke sexual offenders to approach them.",
        "Unfortunately, online sexual predators always outnumber the law enforcement officers and volunteers.",
        "Therefore, tools that can automatically detect sexual predators in chat conversations (or at least serve as support tool for officers) are highly needed.",
        "A few attempts to automate processes related to the sexual predator detection task have been proposed already (Pendar, 2007; Michalopoulos and Mavridis, 2011; RahmanMiah et al., 2011; Inches and Crestani, 2012; Villatoro-Tello et al., 2012; Bogdanova et al., 2013).",
        "The problem of detecting conversations that potentially include a sexual predator approaching a victim has been approached, for example, by (RahmanMiah et al., 2011; Villatoro-Tello et al., 2012; Bogdanova et al.,",
        "2013).",
        "RahmanMiah et al. discriminated among child-exploitation, adult-adult and general-chatting conversations using a text categorization approach and psychometric information (RahmanMiah et al., 2011).",
        "Recently, Bogdanova et al. approached the same problem, the authors concluded that standard text-mining features are useful to distinguish general-chatting from child-exploitation conversations, but not for discriminating between child-exploitation and adult-adult conversations (Bogdanova et al., 2013).",
        "In the latter problem, features that model behavior and emotion resulted particularly helpful.",
        "N. Pendar approached the problem of distinguishing predators from victims within chat conversations previously confirmed as containing a grooming attack (Pendar, 2007).",
        "The author collapsed all of the interventions from each participant into a document and approached the problem as a standard text categorization task with two classes (victim vs. predator).",
        "A more fine grained approximation to the problem was studied by (Michalopoulos and Mavridis, 2011).",
        "The authors developed a probabilistic method that classifies chat interventions into one of three classes: 1) Gaining Access: indicate predators intention to gain access to the victim; 2) Deceptive Relationship: indicate the deceptive relationship that the predator tries to establish with the minor, and are preliminary to a sexual exploitation attack; and 3) Sexual Affair: clearly indicate predator's intention for a sexual affair with the victim.",
        "These categories correspond to the different stages that a sexual offender adopt when approaching a child.",
        "As (Pen-dar, 2007), (Michalopoulos and Mavridis, 2011) approached this problem as one of text categorization (equating interventions to short-documents).",
        "They removed stop words and applied a spelling correction strategy, their best results were obtained with a Na?",
        "?ve Bayes classifier, reaching performance close to 96%.",
        "Thus giving evidence that the three categories can be recognized reasonably well.",
        "Which in turn gives evidence that modeling the three stages could be beneficial for recognizing sexual predators; for example, when it is not known whether a conversation contains or not a grooming attack.",
        "This is the underlying hypothesis behind the proposed method.",
        "We aim to use local classifiers, specialized in the different stages a predator approaches a",
        "child.",
        "Then, we combine the outputs of local classifiers with the goal of improving the performance on sexual predator detection in conversations including both: grooming attacks and well-intentioned conversations.",
        "Because of the relevance of the problem, and of the interest of several research groups from NLP, it was organized in 2012 the first competition of sexual predator identification (Inches and Crestani, 2012).",
        "The problem approached in the competition was that of identifying sexual predators from conversations containing both: grooming attacks and well-intentioned conversations.",
        "The organizers provided a large corpus divided into development and evaluation data.",
        "Development (training) data were provided to participants for building their sexual-predator detection system.",
        "In a second stage, evaluation (testing) data were provided to participants, whom had to apply their system to that data and submit their results.",
        "Organizers evaluated participants using their predictions on evaluation data (labels for the evaluation data were not provided to participants during the competition).",
        "Several research groups participated in that competition, see (Inches and Crestani, 2012).",
        "Some participants developed tailored features for detecting sexual predators (see e.g., (Eriksson and Karl-gren, 2012)), whereas other researchers focused on the development of effective classifiers (Parapar et al., 2012).",
        "The winning approach implemented a two stage formulation (Villatoro-Tello et al., 2012): in a first step suspicious conversations where identified using a two class classifier.",
        "Suspicious conversations are those that potentially include a sexual predator (i.e., a similar approach to (RahmanMiah et al., 2011)).",
        "In a second stage, sexual predators were distinguished from victims in the suspicious conversations identified in the first stage (a similar approach to that of (Pendar, 2007)).",
        "For both stages a standard classifier and a bag-of-words representation was used.",
        "The methods proposed in this paper were evaluated in the corpus used in the first international competition on sexual predator detection, PAN?12 (Inches and Crestani, 2012).",
        "As explained in the following sections, the proposed method uses standard representation and classification methods, therefore, the proposed methods can be improved if we use tailored features or learning techniques for sexual predator detection."

        "We hypothesize that as the vocabulary used in different segments of the conversation is different, specialized models can result in better performance for classifying these local segments.",
        "Since local classifiers can only capture local information, it is desirable to somehow connect these classifiers in order to make predictions taking into account the whole conversation.",
        "One way to make local classifiers dependent is thought the chain-based methodology, where the outputs of one local classifier are feed as inputs for the next local classifier; the final prediction for the whole conversation can be obtained in several ways as described below.",
        "The proposed approach is described in Figure 1.",
        "Since our goal is to detect sexual predators from chat conversations directly, we model each user (well-intentioned user, victim or sexual predator) by their set of interventions.",

        "Likewise, the outputs of f2 and f1, together with part p3 from the document are used as inputs for classifier f3.",

        "Clearly, the best performance was obtained with the ensemble methods: chain-ensemble and cumulative-ensemble.",
        "Both approaches obtained similar performance, although the chain-ensemble slightly outperformed cumulative-ensemble.",
        "The chain-ensemble considers dependencies within each order and not across orders, thus its performance after trying the 6 permutations of 3 segments did not vary significantly.",
        "This is advantageous as only 6 orders have to be evaluated to obtain competitive performance.",
        "Unfortunately, as with single chain-classifiers it may be unclear how to select the particular order to use to implement a sexual-predator detection system.",
        "On the other hand, the cumulative-ensemble ob",
        "tained stable performance after ?",
        "12 orders were considered.",
        "Recall this method incorporates dependencies among the different orders tried.",
        "Although it requires the evaluation of more orders than the chain-ensemble to converge, this method is advantageous for a real application: after a certain number of orders it achieves steady performance, and since it averages the outputs of all of the chain-classifiers evaluated up to a certain iteration, its performance does not rely on selecting a particular configuration.",
        "In consequence, we claim the cumulative-ensemble offers the best tradeoff between performance, stability and model selection."
