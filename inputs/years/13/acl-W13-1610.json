        "A large number of opinion-rich reviews about most products and services are available on the web.",
        "These reviews are often summarized by star ratings to help consumers in making buying decisions.",
        "While such a summarization is very useful, often consumers like to know about specific features of the product/service.",
        "For example in the case of restaurants consumers might want to know what people think about their chicken dish.",
        "There are many research papers on both supervised (Li et al., 2010) and unsupervised(Liu et al., 2012),(Hu and Liu, 2004), (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005), (Baccianella et al., 2009) methods for extracting reviewer's opinions and their targets (features of products/services) from textual reviews.",
        "Unsupervised methods are preferred as they can be used across domains, however their performance is limited by the assumptions they make about lexical and syntactic properties of opinion and target phrases.",
        "We would like to use supervised methods to develop information extraction models that can also be used across domains with minimum adaptation.",
        "We hope to succeed in our goal because: a) even though there are domain specific opinion phrases, we believe a large proportion of opinion phrases can be used across the domains with the same semantic interpretation; b) target phrases mostly contain domain dependent words, but have domain independent syntactic relationships with opinion phrases.",
        "Obviously for a domain containing large number of domain dependent opinion phrases, our models will perform poorly and additional domain adaptation will be necessary.",
        "In this paper we discuss a tagging scheme to manually tag the necessary training data.",
        "In section 2 we show that simply tagging opinion and target phrases, forces a large number of opinion phrases to contain domain dependent vocabulary.",
        "This makes them domain dependent, even when domain independent opinion words are used.",
        "In section 3 we propose a modification to the simple tagging scheme and show that this modification allows tagging of opinion phrases without forcing them to contain domain dependent vocabulary.",
        "We also identify many linguistic structures used to express opinions that cannot be captured even with our modified tagging scheme.",
        "In section 4 we experimentally show the improvement in the coverage of tagged domain independent opinion phrases due to our proposed modification.",
        "In section 5 we discuss the relationship with other work.",
        "We conclude this paper in section 6 by summarizing the contribution of this work."

        "As a result majority of the opinion phrases are tagged as domain dependent.",
        "Example 1, 2 show that the tagging scheme cannot express attributes of a target.",
        "Therefore, they are lumped with the opinion phrases, making them domain dependent.",

        "To accurately represent opinions expressed in the infinitely many compositions, natural languages offer, a more complex representation is required.",
        "Instead of solving this knowledge representation problem, we introduce two additional tags and relations, and show that our modified tagging scheme is able to capture opinions expressed through some commonly used expressions."
