        "These facts have motivated dealing with the identification and extraction of opinions and sentiments in texts that require special attention.",
        "Among most widely used terms in Natural Language Processing, in concrete in Sentiment Analysis (SA) and Opinion Mining, is the subjectivity term proposed by (Wiebe, 1994).",
        "This author defines it as ?linguistic expression of somebody's opinions, sentiments, emotions, evaluations, beliefs and speculations?.",
        "Another important aspect opposed to subjectivity is the objectivity, which constitute a fact expression (Balahur, 2011).",
        "Other interesting terms also proposed by (Wiebe et al., 2005) considers, private state, theses terms involve opinions, beliefs, thoughts, feelings, emotions, goals, evaluations and judgments.",

        "To build systems able to lead SA challenges it is necessary to achieve sentiment resources previously developed.",
        "These resources could be annotated corpora, affective semantic structures, and sentiment dictionaries.",
