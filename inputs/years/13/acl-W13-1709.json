        "This paper presents and evaluates approaches to automatically score the content correctness of spoken responses in a new language test for teachers of English as a foreign language who are non-native speakers of English.",
        "Most existing tests of English spoken proficiency elicit responses that are either very constrained (e.g., reading a passage aloud) or are of a predominantly spontaneous nature (e.g., stating an opinion on an issue).",
        "However, the assessment discussed in this paper focuses on essential speaking skills that English teachers need in order to be effective communicators in their classrooms and elicits mostly responses that fall in between these extremes and are moderately predictable.",
        "In order to automatically score the content accuracy of these spoken responses, we propose three categories of robust features, inspired from flexible text matching, n-grams, as well as string edit distance metrics.",
        "The experimental results indicate that even based on speech recognizer output, most of the feature correlations with human expert rater scores are in the range of r = 0.4 to r = 0.5, and further, that a scoring model for predicting human rater proficiency scores that includes our content features can significantly outperform a baseline without these features (r = 0.56 vs. r = 0.33)."

        "With the increased need for instruction of international learners of English as a foreign language (EFL), there is a concomitant rise in demand to assess the language competence of English teachers who are non-native speakers of English.",
        "This situation arises because it is neither possible nor affordable for countries where English is not spoken as a native language to employ only or even mostly native speakers of English as EFL teachers.",
        "Moreover, as the language of instruction increasingly becomes English in most classrooms, teachers?",
        "competence in the productive language modality of speaking becomes substantially more important than in the past.",
        "In order to meet this demand for assessing the English language proficiency of teachers of English, a new test, English Teachers Language Assessment (ETLA), was developed recently and piloted in 2012.",
        "The test comprises items for all four main language modalities: reading, listening, writing and speaking.",
        "While reading and listening items use a multiple-choice paradigm, test items for speaking and writing elicit open responses.",
        "For cost and efficiency reasons, we aim to employ automated scoring of written and spoken responses in this test.",
        "This paper is concerned in particular with the conceptualization, implementation and evaluation of features that can assess one aspect of English speaking proficiency: the content correctness of a test taker's response.",
        "Our automated speech scoring system, SpeechRaterSM The speaking items in ETLA range in complexity from reading a text passage aloud to more challenging tasks requiring multi-sentence responses related to typical teaching situations.",
        "The items, therefore, elicit speech in which predictability ranges from high (e.g., reading aloud) to medium (e.g., open responses based on teaching material).",
        "(Zechner et al., 2009), also has features addressing other aspects of speaking proficiency, such as fluency or pronunciation, but the details of these features will not be discussed as part of this paper.",
        "While approaches to capture the content of mostly predictable speech have been widely used in the past (see, e.g., Alwan et al., 2007; Franco et al., 2010), this is not the case for responses that exhibit considerable variation but are still much shorter and more constrained than spontaneous items from other language tests, such as TOEFL iBT?",
        "Therefore, the goal of the study reported in this paper is to conceptualize, implement and evaluate features that can address the subset of ETLA speaking items where responses are not strongly predictable but are still fairly short and constrained by the context of the item stimulus and prompt.",
        ".",
        "To illustrate what an ETLA speaking item may look like, we provide a relatively simple example here.",
        "Suppose the test taker (i.e., an English language teacher) is asked to request that the class open their textbooks on page 55.",
        "We could see a range of responses, from ?perfect?",
        "(score level 3, e.g., ?Please open your textbooks on page 55.?",
        "or ?Please open your textbooks and turn to page 55.?",
        "), to ?good?",
        "(score level 2, e.g., ?Please open the books on the page 55.?)",
        "and to ?poor?",
        "(score level 1, e.g., ?Open book page 55.?).",
        "Again, note that for this paper we are not interested in potential issues with fluency, such as long pauses or speaking rate, nor with pronunciation or prosody.",
        "We just look at the content of the test takers?",
        "responses, either in idealized form by means of a human transcription of what a test taker actually said, or in a realistic operational scenario, where we look at the output of an ASR system.",
        "In both cases, we consider the sequence of words only (i.e., a textual representation of the test takers?",
        "spoken responses).",
        "One important aspect of any features used for content scoring is that they have to be robust with respect to speech recognition errors.",
        "Robustness is necessary because we are using an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system as a front end, and the average word error rate of the system is around 27% for moderately predictable item responses.",
        "In order to investigate the effectiveness of candidate content features in a short-term development cycle before a larger amount of pilot data would be available, we first conducted a small scale in-house 1 A test item is a basic element of a test, consisting of stimulus material, such as text and/or visuals, and a prompt (test question) that elicits a response from the test taker.",
        "data collection effort focusing on the moderately predictable spoken items in ETLA.",
        "Based on the analysis of this mini-corpus, several different categories of promising features were selected for potential operational use and then evaluated on the pilot data.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview on related work; Section 3 describes the in-house data set, the pilot data and the ASR system; the developed features are presented in Section 4; Section 5 presents our experiments; we then discuss our findings in Section 6 and we conclude the paper in Section 7."

        "The goal of this paper was to conceptualize, implement and evaluate features that can determine the content correctness of spoken item responses in an English language test for teachers of English who are not native speakers of English.",
        "Based on observations from a small in-house data collection, where human test developers and content experts created example responses to 22 test items for three different score levels, we decided to implement a range of features that can capture the content correctness of test takers?",
        "responses in varying degree of precision.",
        "Our fea",
        "tures belong to three classes: features related to fixed expressions, with potential small variations, such as regular expressions or keywords; features based on n-grams of words or POS tags, including the BLEU metrics frequently used for evaluations of machine translation output; and features related to measures of string edit distance, including the WER metrics commonly used in speech recognition evaluations.",
        "It should be noted that we use the term ?content?",
        "in a fairly broad way in this paper, namely, everything in a spoken response that is not related to lower-level aspects of speech production such as fluency or pronunciation.",
        "Since the scoring rubrics for ETLA place a high emphasis both on the grammatical accuracy, as well as on the correct content (in a more narrow sense), this situation is reflected by our choice of features that focus both on elements traditionally associated with content (such as matching of keywords), as well as on elements more related to correct grammatical expressions (e.g., sequences of POS tags).",
        "Our initial evaluations on the small in-house data collection showed that most of these features correlate well with human expert scores, both when using transcribed speech as well as when using ASR output.",
        "The absolute correlations for human transcriptions of speech range from r = 0.144 (bleu_score) to r = 0.789 (re_match), and for ASR output from r = 0.194 (bleu_score) to r = 0.614 (ed_score).",
        "The relative drop in correlation between these two conditions varies across features, but is generally around 5%-15%, with re_match having a much larger performance drop from r = 0.789 for transcribed speech to r = 0.537 for ASR output (32% relative decrease in performance).",
        "6 From this initial set of 15 features, we selected seven features based on feature performance, inter-correlation analyses (i.e., avoiding features that have a high inter-correlation and measure a similar aspect of content), and considerations of construct, i.e., which features are representing content in a way that is consistent with what human experts would consider important in determining the content correctness of a response.",

      "heading": "6 The correlation of one feature, pos_3, remained unchanged",
      "text": [
        "between the two conditions, and two features, pos_score and bleu_score, showed higher correlations for ASR output than for human transcriptions.",
        "features includes three features each from the classes of flexible string matching and string edit distance, and one feature (bleu_3) from the n-gram class.",
        "When evaluating these seven features on a larger data set, the smTrain and smEval sets of the 2012 ETLA pilot data, we find absolute correlations between features and human holistic scores ranging from r = 0.286 to r = 0.480 for ASR output, and from r = 0.419 to r = 0.597 for transcriptions.",
        "The relative decrease in correlation between transcriptions and ASR outputs ranges from 16% to 32% in these data sets (smTrain and smEval).",
        "The magnitude of content feature correlations observed in this study is similar to that of features related to fluency and pronunciation computed on spontaneous speech, as reported in Zechner et al. (2009).",
        "In fact, due to the brevity of the moderately predictable responses in ETLA, features related to fluency and pronunciation achieve correlations of less than 0.3 on this data set, making content features crucial for the assessment of speech here.",
        "When comparing the six content features that are identical between the original feature set of 15 features (in-house data collection) and the final feature set, we observe a relative drop in feature correlation between the in-house data set and the smEval pilot data set between 1% (blue_3) and 36% (ed_score), with an average decrease of 20%.",
        "This performance decrease can be explained by (1) the more challenging data set of the pilot, as indicated, e.g., by a much higher word error rate of the ASR system (27% vs. 18%); and (2) the fact that the in-house data collection was much more constrained in terms of test taker response variation compared to the real-world pilot data.",
        "Since a subset of the ETLA responses was also scored analytically by human raters, we could further compare the feature correlations between holistic vs. analytic content scores (Section 5.2).",
        "We find that on smEval, for all features, absolute correlations increase on human analytic content scores compared to human holistic scores.",
        "Although these differences are rather small (0.01 to 0.04), this is an indicator that our features are measuring what they are supposed to measure, since the holistic scores also take other dimensions of speech, such as fluency and pronunciation, into account."

        "We implemented and evaluated an initial set of 15 content features from three feature classes: flexible string matching, n-grams and string edit distance metrics.",
        "A subset of these features was then evaluated on a 2012 ETLA pilot administration, and we found correlations between features and human holistic scores in the range of r = 0.29 to r = 0.48 on ASR output.",
        "Correlations increased when comparing features with human analytic content scores.",
        "Finally, we compared a baseline regression scoring model for prediction of human holistic scores without any content features to an extended model using seven content features and found that the model correlation substantially improved from r = 0.33 (baseline) to r = 0.56 (extended model).",
        "Future work will include devising strategies on how to obtain RegEx features more quickly in a semi-automated way in order to reduce human la-bor.",
        "Further, we plan more in-depth analysis of the feature performance across different test items and item types which potentially could lead to further improvements and refinements of our content features."
