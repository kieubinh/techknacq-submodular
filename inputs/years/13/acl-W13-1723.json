        "Learner corpora have been essential for developing error correction systems and intelligent tutoring systems (e.g., Nagata et al., 2011; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010).",
        "So far, error annotation has been the main focus, to the exclusion of corpora and annotation for more basic NLP development, despite the need for parse information for error detection (Tetreault et al., 2010), learner proficiency identification (Hawkins and Buttery, 2010), and acquisition research (Ragheb and Dickinson, 2011).",
        "Indeed, there is very little work on POS tagging (Thoue?sny, 2009; van Rooy and Scha?fer, 2002; de Haan, 2000) or parsing (Rehbein et al., 2012; Krivanek and Meur-ers, 2011; Ott and Ziai, 2010) learner language, and, not coincidentally, there is a lack of annotated data and standards for these tasks.",
        "One issue is in knowing how to handle innovative learner forms: some map to a target form before annotating syntax (e.g., Hirschmann et al., 2010), while others propose directly annotating the text (e.g., Ragheb and Dickinson, 2011).",
        "We follow this latter strand and further our work towards a syntactically-annotated corpus of learner English by: a) presenting an annotation scheme for dependencies, integrated with other annotation layers, and b) testing the inter-annotator agreement for this scheme.",
        "Despite concerns that direct annotation of the linguistic properties of learners may not be feasible (e.g., Rose?n and Smedt, 2010), we find that annotators have generally strong agreement, especially after adjudication, and the reasons for disagreement often have as much to do with the complexities of syntax or interface issues as they do with learner innovations.",
        "Probing grammatical annotation can lead to advancements in research on POS tagging and syntactic parsing of learner language, for it shows what can be annotated reliably and what needs additional diagnostics.",
        "We specifically report on inter-annotator agreement (IAA) for the annotation scheme described in section 2, focusing on dependency annotation.",
        "There are numerous studies investigating inter-annotator agreement between coders for different types of grammatical annotation schemes, focusing on part-of-speech, syntactic, or semantic annotation (e.g., Passonneau et al., 2006; Babarczy et al., 2006; Civit et al., 2003).",
        "For learner language, a",
        "number of error annotation projects include measures of interannotator agreement, (see, e.g., Boyd, 2012; Lee et al., 2012; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010; Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008; Bonaventura et al., 2000), but as far as we are aware, there have been no studies on IAA for grammatical annotation.",
        "We have conducted an IAA study to investigate the quality and robustness of our annotation scheme, as reported in section 3.",
        "In section 4, we report quantitative results and a qualitative analysis of this study to tease apart disagreements due to inherent ambiguity or text difficulty from those due to the annotation scheme and/or the guidelines.",
        "The study has already reaped benefits by helping us to revise our annotation scheme and guidelines, and the insights gained here should be applicable for future development of other annotation schemes and to parsing studies.",
        "On a final note, our dependency annotation allows for multiple heads for each token in the corpus, violating the so-called single-head constraint (Ku?bler et al., 2009).",
        "In the process of evaluating these dependencies (see section 4.1), we also make some minor contributions towards comparing sets of dependencies, moving beyond just F-measure (e.g., Cer et al., 2010) to account for partial agreements."

        "For example, in the learner sentence (1), the verb admit clearly occurs in the form of an active verb, and is annotated as such, regardless of the (passive) meaning of the sentence (cf. was admitted).",
        "In this case, basing the annotation on syntactic evidence makes for a more straightforward task.",

        "... Another part of the motivation for shying away from marking target forms and annotating the syntactic properties of those (cf., e.g., Rehbein et al., 2012) is that, for general essays from learners of many levels, the grammatical evidence can be understood even when the intended meaning is not.",

        "Another aspect of our annotation scheme is that we do not directly annotate errors (except for lexical violations; see section 2.1).",

        "In table 6, for example, annotators A and C have vastly different GCM values for phase 2 (91.2% vs. 73.7%), due to annotator C annotating many more subcategorization labels.",

        "We highlight some of the important issues that stand out when we take a closer look at the nature of the disagreements in the final phase.",
        "As pointed out earlier regarding the differences between Text 1 and Text 2 (section 4.2.2), some disagreements are likely due to the nature of the text itself, both because of its non-native properties and because of the syntactic complexity.",
        "Starting with unique learner innovations leading to non-uniform treatment, several cases stemmed from not agreeing on the lemma, when a word looks non-English or does not fit the context.",
        "An example is cares in (8): although the guidelines should lead the annotators to choose care as the lemma, staying true to the learner form, one annotator chose to accommodate the context and changed the lemma to case.",
        "This relying too heavily on intended meaning and not enough on syntactic evidence?as the scheme is designed for?",
        "was a consistent problem.",
        "(8) My majors are bankruptcy , corporate reorganizations .",

        ".",
        "and arquisisiton cares .",
        "For (8), the trees do not change because the different lemmas are of the same syntactic category, but more problematic are cases where the trees differ based on different readings.",
        "In the learner sentence (9), the non-agreement between this and cause led to a disagreement of this being a COORD of and vs. this being an APPOS (appositive) of factors.",
        "The annotator reported that the choice for this latter analysis came from treating this as these, again contrary to guidelines but consistent with one meaning.",
        "(9) Sometimes animals are subjected to changed environmental factors during their developmental process and this cause FA .",
        "Another great source of disagreement stems from the syntactic complexity of some of the structures, even if native-like, though this can be intertwined with non-native properties, as in (10).",
        "Although annotators eventually agreed on the annotation here, there was initial disagreement on the coordination structure of this sentence, questioning whether to be coordinates with pursuing or only with to earn, or whether pursuing coordinates only with to earn (the analysis they finally chose).",
        "(10) My most important goals are pursuing the profession to be a top marketing manager and then to earn a lot of money to buy a beautiful house and a good car .",
        "Annotator disagreements stemmed not only from the text, but from other factors as well, such as aspects of the scheme that needed more clarification, some interface issues, and the fact that the guidelines though extensive, are still not comprehensive.",
        "A few parts of the annotation scheme were confusing to annotators and likely need refinement.",
        "For example, if the form of a word was incorrect, we saw a lot of lexical violation annotation, even if it",
        "was only an issue of grammatical marking and POS (e.g., did/VVD instead of done/VVN), as opposed to a truly different word choice.",
        "We are currently tightening the annotation scheme and adding clarifications about lexical violations in our guidelines.",
        "As another example, verb raising was often not marked (cf. figure 1), in spite of the scheme and guidelines requiring it.",
        "In their comments, annotators mentioned that it seemed ?redundant?",
        "to them and that it caused arcs to cross, which they found ?unappealing.?",
        "One annotator commented that they did not have enough syntactic background to see why marking multiple subjects was necessary.",
        "We are thus considering a simpler treatment.",
        "Another option in the future is to hire annotators with more background in syntax.",
        "The interface may be partly to blame for some disagreements, including subcategorizations which annotators often left unmarked (section 4.2.3) or only partly marked (e.g., leaving off a SUBJect for a verb which has been raised).",
        "There are a few reasons for this.",
        "First, marking subcategorization likely needed more emphasis in the training period, seeing as how it relates to complicated linguistic notions like distinguishing arguments and adjuncts.",
        "Secondly, the interface is an issue, as the subcategorization field is not directly visible, compared to the arcs drawn for dependencies; in figure 2, for instance, subcategorization can only be seen in the asterisks, which need to be clicked on to be seen and changed.",
        "Relatedly, because it is not always necessary, subcategorization may seem more optional and thus forgettable.",
        "By the nature of being an in-progress project, the guidelines were necessarily not comprehensive.",
        "As one example, the TRANS(ition) label was only generally defined, leading to disagreements.",
        "As another, a slash could indicate coordination (actor/actress), and annotators differed on its POS labeling, as either CC (coordinating conjunction), or a PUNCT (punctuation).",
        "The different POS labels then led to vastly different dependency graphs.",
        "In spite of a lengthy section on how to handle coordination in the guidelines, it seems that an additional case needs to be added to the guidelines to cover when punctuation is used as a conjunction."

        "Developing reliable annotation schemes for learner language is an important step towards better POS tagging and parsing of learner corpora.",

        "This study shows that it is possible to apply a multi-layered dependency annotation scheme to learner text with considerably good agreement rates between three trained annotators.",
        "In the future, we will of course be applying the (revised) annotation scheme to larger data sets, but we hope other grammatical annotation schemes can learn from our experience.",
        "In the shorter term, we are constructing a gold standard of the text files used here, to test annotation accuracy and whether any (or all) annotators had consistent difficulties.",
        "Another next step is to gather a larger pool of data and focus more on analyzing the effects of L1 and learner proficiency level on annotation.",
        "Finally, given that syntactic representations can assist in automating tasks such as developmental profiling of learners (e.g., Vyatkina, 2013), grammatical error detection (Tetreault et al., 2010), identification of native language (e.g., Tetreault et al., 2012), and proficiency level determination (Dickinson et al., 2012)?all of which impact NLP-based educational tools?one can explore the effect of specific syntactic decisions on such tasks, as a way to provide feedback on the annotation scheme."
