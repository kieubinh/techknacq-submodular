        "The task we address in this work is identifying the native language (L1) of non-native English (L2) authors.",
        "More specifically, given a dataset of short English essays (Blanchard et al., 2013), composed as part of the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) by authors whose native language is one out of 11 possible languages?Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Telugu, or Turkish?our task is to identify that language.",
        "This task has a clear empirical motivation.",
        "Non-native speakers make different errors when they write English, depending on their native language (Lado, 1957; Swan and Smith, 2001); understanding the different types of errors is a prerequisite for correcting them (Leacock et al., 2010), and systems such as the one we describe here can shed interesting light on such errors.",
        "Tutoring applications can use our system to identify the native language of students and offer better-targeted advice.",
        "Forensic linguistic applications are sometimes required to determine the L1 of authors (Estival et al., 2007b; Es-tival et al., 2007a).",
        "Additionally, we believe that the task is interesting in and of itself, providing a better understanding of non-native language.",
        "We are thus equally interested in defining meaningful features whose contribution to the task can be linguistically interpreted.",
        "Briefly, our features draw heavily on prior work in general text classification and authorship identification, those used in identifying so-called translationese (Volansky et al., forthcoming), and a class of features that involves determining what minimal changes would be necessary to transform the essays into ?standard?",
        "English (as determined by an n-gram language model).",
        "We address the task as a multiway text-classification task; we describe our data in ?3 and classification model in ?4.",
        "As in other author attribution tasks (Juola, 2006), the choice of features for the classifier is crucial; we discuss the features we define in ?5.",

        "The texts range from 500 to 850 words in length.",
        "Their classification method is a linear SVM, and features include 400 standard function words, 200 letter n-grams, 185 error types and 250 rare part-of-speech (POS) bigrams.",

        "Wong and Dras (2009; 2011) are also motivated by a linguistic hypothesis, namely that syntactic errors in a text are influenced by the author's L1.",
        "Wong and Dras (2009) analyze three error types statistically, and then add them as features in the same experimental setup as above (using LIBSVM with a radial kernel for classification).",

        "A completely different approach is offered by Brooke and Hirst (2011).",

        "of the essays.",
        "Refer to figure 1 to see the set of features and their values that were extracted from an example sentence.",
        "POS n-grams Part-of-speech n-grams were used in various text-classification tasks.",
        "Prompt Since the prompt contributes information on the domain, it is likely that some words (and, hence, character sequences) will occur more frequently with some prompts than with others.",
        "We therefore use the prompt ID in conjunction with other features.",
        "Document length The number of tokens in the text is highly correlated with the author's level of fluency, which in turn is correlated with the author's L1.",
        "Pronouns The use of pronouns varies greatly among different authors.",
        "We use the same list of 25 English pronouns that Volansky et al. (forthcoming) use for identifying translationese.",
        "Punctuation Similarly, different languages use punctuation differently, and we expect this to taint the use of punctuation in non-native texts.",
        "Of course, character n-grams subsume this feature.",
        "Passives English uses passive voice more frequently than other languages.",
        "Again, the use of passives in L2 can be correlated with the author's L1.",
        "Positional token frequency The choice of the first and last few words in a sentence is highly constrained, and may be significantly influenced by the author's L1.",
        "Cohesive markers These are 40 function words (and short phrases) that have a strong discourse function in texts (however, because, in fact, etc.).",
        "Translators tend to spell out implicit utterances and render them explicitly in the target text (Blum-Kulka, 1986).",
        "We use the list of Volansky et al. (forthcoming).",
        "Cohesive verbs This is a list of manually compiled verbs that are used, like cohesive markers, to spell out implicit utterances (indicate, imply, contain, etc.).",
        "Function words Frequent tokens, which are mostly function words, have been used successfully for various text classification tasks.",
        "Koppel and Ordan (2011) define a list of 400 such words, of which we only use 100 (using the entire list was not significantly different).",
        "Note that pronouns are included in this list.",
        "Contextual function words To further capitalize on the ability of function words to discriminate, we define pairs consisting of a function word from the list mentioned above, along with the POS tag of its adjacent word.",
        "This feature captures patterns such as verbs and the preposition or particle immediately to their right, or nouns and the determiner that precedes them.",
        "We also define 3-grams consisting of one or two function words and the POS tag of the third word in the 3-gram.",
        "Lemmas The content of the text is not considered a good indication of the author's L1, but many text categorization tasks use lemmas (more precisely, the stems produced by the tagger) as features approximating the content.",

        "is extremely difficult for L2 learners (Hayes-Harb and Masuda, 2008).",
        "Since English's orthography is largely phonemic?even if it is irregular in many places, we expect leaners whose native phoneme contrasts are different from those of English to make characteristic spelling errors.",
        "For example, since Japanese and Korean lack a phonemic /l/-/r/ contrast, we expect native speakers of those languages to be more likely to make spelling errors that confuse l and r relative to native speakers of languages such as Spanish in which that pair is contrastive.",
        "To make this information available to our model, we use a noisy channel spelling corrector (Kernighan, 1990) to identify and correct misspelled words in the training and test data.",
        "From these corrections, we extract minimal edit features that show what insertions, deletions, substitutions and joinings (where two separate words are written merged into a single orthographic token) were made by the author of the essay.",
        "Restored tags We focus on three important token classes defined above: punctuation marks, function words and cohesive verbs.",
        "We first remove words in these classes from the texts, and then recover the most likely hidden tokens in a sequence of words, according to an n-gram language model trained on all essays in the training corpus corrected with a spell checker and containing both words and hidden tokens.",
        "This feature should capture specific words or punctuation marks that are consistently omitted (deletions), or misused (insertions, substitutions).",
        "To restore hidden tokens we use the hidden-ngram utility provided in SRI's language modeling toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).",
        "Brown clusters (Brown et al., 1992) describe an algorithm that induces a hierarchical clustering of a language's vocabulary based on each vocabulary item's tendency to appear in similar left and right contexts in a training corpus.",

        "Using an open-source implementation of the algorithm,2 we clustered 8 billion words of English into 600 classes.3 We included log counts of all 4-grams of Brown clusters that occurred at least 100 times in the NLI training data."
