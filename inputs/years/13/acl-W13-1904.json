        "This is hindering the radiologist's workflow.",
        "Especially when reading reports, radiologists want to link back from the described finding (in the text) to the related body location (in the images).",
        "Today, they establish the link manually.",
        "This is obviously time-consuming when state-of-the-art imaging modalities deliver a mass of stacked images.",
        "In order to link radiology images and reports, each information source needs to be annotated with semantic meta-information about the anatomical entities they describe.",

        "We introduce a mechanism that extracts those semantic annotations from the radiology reports to enable the integration.",

        "Those findings are included in the reports in order to exclude differential diagnoses.",
