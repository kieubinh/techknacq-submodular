        "As firstly demonstrated by (Gildea, 2001), parsing systems have a drop of accuracy when tested against domain corpora outside of the data from which they were trained.",
        "This is a real problem in the biomedical domain where, due to the rapidly expanding body of biomedical literature, the need for increasingly sophisticated and efficient biomedical text mining systems is becoming more and more pressing.",
        "In particular, the existence of natural language parsers reliably dealing with biomedical texts represents the prerequiste for identifying and extracting knowledge embedded in them.",
        "Over the last years, this problem has been tackled within the biomedical NLP community from different perspectives.",
        "The development of a domain?specific annotated corpus, i.e. the Genia Treebank (Tateisi, Yakushiji, Ohta, & Tsujii, 2005), played a key role by providing a sound basis for empirical performance evaluation as well as training of parsers.",
        "On the other hand, several attempts have been made to adapt general parsers to the biomedical domain.",
        "First experiments in this direction are reported in (Clegg & Shepherd, 2005) who first compared the performance of three different parsers against the Genia treebank and a sample of the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Mitchell P. Marcus & Santorini, 1993) in order to carry out an inter?domain analysis of the typology of errors made by each parser and demonstrated that by integrating the output of the three parsers they achieved statistically significant performance gains.",
        "Three different methods of parser adaptation for the biomedical domain have been proposed by (Lease & Charniak, 2005) who, starting from the results of unknown word rate experiments carried out on the Genia treebank, adapted a PTB?trained parser by improving the Part?Of?Speech tagging accuracy and by relying on an external domain?specific lexicon.",
        "More recently, (McClosky, Charniak, & Johnson, 2010) and (Plank & van Noord, 2011) devised adaptation methods based on domain similarity measures.",
        "In particular, both of them adopted lexical similarity measures to automatically select from an annotated collection of texts those training data which is more relevant, i.e. lexically closer, to adapt the parser to the target domain.",
        "A variety of semi?supervised approaches, where unlabeled data is used in addition to labeled training data, have been recently proposed in the literature in order to adapt parsing systems to new domains.",
        "Among these approaches, the last few years have seen a growing interest in self?training for domain adaptation, i.e. a method for using automatically annotated data from a target domain when training supervised models.",
        "Self?training methods proposed so far mainly differ at the level of the selection of parse trees to be added to the in?domain gold trees as further training data.",
        "Depending on whether or not external supervised classifiers are used to select the parses to be added to the gold?training set, two types of methods are envisaged in the literature.",
        "The first is the case, among others, of: (Kawahara & Uchimoto, 2008), using a machine learning classifier to predict the reliability of parses on the basis of different feature types; or (Sagae & Tsujii, 2007), selecting",
        "identical analyses for the same sentence within the output of different parsing models trained on the same dataset; or (McClosky, Charniak, & Johnson, 2006), using a discriminative reranker against the output of a n?best generative parser for selecting the best parse for each sentence to be used as further training data.",
        "Yet, due to the fact that several supervised classifiers are resorted to for improving the base supervised parser, this class of methods cannot be seen as a genuine istance of self?training.",
        "The second type of methods is exemplified, among others, by (Reichart & Rap-poport, 2007) who use the whole set of automatically analyzed sentences, and by (McClosky & Charniak, 2008) and (Sagae, 2010) who add different amounts of automatically parsed data without any selection strategy.",
        "Note that (McClosky & Charniak, 2008) tested their self?training approach on the Genia Treebank: they self?trained a PTB?trained costituency parser using a random selection of Medline abstracts.",
        "In this paper, we address the second scenario with a main novelty: we use an unsupervised approach to select reliable parses from automatically parsed target domain texts to be combined with the gold?training set.",
        "Two unsupervised algorithms have been proposed so far in the literature for selecting reliable parses, namely: PUPA (POS?",
        "based Unsupervised Parse Assessment Algorithm) (Reichart & Rappoport, 2009) and ULISSE (Unsupervised LInguiStically?driven Selection of dEpendency parses) (Dell?Orletta, Venturi, & Montemagni, 2011).",
        "Both algorithms assign a quality score to each parse tree based on statistics collected from a large automatically parsed corpus, with a main difference: whereas PUPA operates on costituency trees and uses statistics about sequences of part?of?speech tags, ULISSE uses statistics about linguistic features checked against dependency?based representations.",
        "The self?",
        "training strategy presented in this paper is based on an augmented version of ULISSE.",
        "The reasons for this choice are twofold: if on the one hand ULISSE appears to outperform PUPA (namely, a dependency?based version of PUPA implemented in (Dell?Orletta et al., 2011)), on the other hand the linguistically?driven nature of ULISSE makes our self?training strategy for domain adaptation able to capture reliable parses which are also representative of the syntactic peculiarities of the target domain.",
        "After introducing the in?",
        "and out?domain corpora used in this study (Section 2), we discuss the results of the multi?level linguistic analysis of these corpora carried out (Section 3) with a view to identifying the main features differentiating the biomedical language from ordinary language.",
        "In Section 4, the algorithm used to select reliable parses from automatically parsed domain?specific texts is described.",
        "In Section 5 the proposed self?",
        "training method is illustrated, followed by a discussion of achieved results (Section 6)."

        "syntactic and syntactic).",
        "Let us start from raw text features, in particular from average sentence length (calculated as the average number of words per sentence): as Figure 1 shows, both the corpus of automatically parsed newspaper articles (WSJ unlab) and the manually annotated one (WSJ gold) contain shorter sentences with respect to both the automatically parsed biomedical abstrats (BIO unlab) and the manually annotated ones (Genia gold), a result which is in line",
        "and newspaper corpora.",
        "with (Clegg & Shepherd, 2005) findings.",
        "When we focus on the lexical level, BIO unlab and Genia gold appear to have quite a similar percentage of lexical items which is not contained in WSJ gold (23.13% and 26.14% respectively) while the out?of?vocabulary rate of WSJ unlab is much lower, i.e. 8.69%.",
        "Similar results were recorded by (Lease & Charniak, 2005) who report the unknown word rate for various genres of tec-nical literature.",
        "Let us focus now on the morpho?syntactic level.",
        "If we consider the distribution of nouns, verbs and adjectives, three features typically representing stylistic markers associated with different linguistic varieties (Biber & Conrad, 2009), it can be noticed (see Figures 2(a) and 2(c)) that the biomedical abstracts contain a higher percentage of nouns and adjectives while showing a significantly lower percentage of verbs (Figure 2(b)).",
        "The syntactic counterpart of the different distribution of morpho?syntactic categories can be observed in Table 1, reporting the percentage distribution of the first ten Parts?of?Speech dependency triplets occurring in the biomedical and newspaper corpora: each triplet is described as the sequence of the PoS of a dependent and a head linked by a depedency arc, by also considering the PoS of the head father.",
        "It turned out that biomedical abstracts are characterized by nominal dependency triplets, e.g. two nouns and a preposition (NN?NN?IN) or noun, preposition, noun (NN?IN?NN) or adjective, noun and preposition (JJ?NN?IN), which occur more frequently than verbal triplets, such as determiner, noun and verb (DT?NN?VBZ) or a verbal root (.?VBD?ROOT)4.",
        "Interestingly, in Genia gold no verbal triplet occurs within the top ten triplets, which cover the 21% of the total amount",
        "of triplets occurring in the corpus.",
        "By contrast, the same top ten triplets represent only ?11% in WSJ gold, testifying the wider variety of syntactic constructions occurring in newspaper articles with respect to texts of the biomedical domain.",
        "This is also proved by the total amount of different PoS dependency triplets occurring in the two gold datasets, i.e. 7,827 in WSJ gold and 5,064 in Genia gold even though the Genia Treebank is ?50,000?tokens bigger.",
        "Further differences can be observed at a deeper syntactic level of analysis.",
        "This is the case of the average depth of embedded complement ?chains?",
        "governed by a nominal head.",
        "Figure 3(a) shows that biomedical abstracts are characterized by an average depth which is higher than the one observed in newspaper articles.",
        "A similar trend can be observed for what concerns the distribution of ?chains?",
        "by depth.",
        "In Figure 3(b) shows that WSJ unlab and WSJ gold ?chains?, on the one hand, and BIO unlab and Genia gold ?chains?, on the other hand, overlap.",
        "The corpora have also been compared with respect to i) the average length of dependency links, measured in terms of the words occurring between the syntactic head and the dependent (excluding punctuation marks), and ii) the average depth of the whole parse tree, calculated in terms of the longest path from the root of the dependency tree to a leaf.",
        "In both cases it can be noted that i) the biomedical abstracts contain much longer dependency links than newswire texts (Figure 3(c)) and ii) the average depth of BIO unlab and Genia gold parse trees is higher than in the case of the WSJ unlab and WSJ gold (Figure 3(d)).",

        "set: no LAS improvement is observed with respect to the results obtained with the BASE model, i.e. 86.09% (see Table 3).",
        "This result is in line with (McClosky et al., 2010) and (Plank & van Noord, 2011) who proved that parsers trained on the union of gold corpora belonging to different domains achieve a lower accuracy with respect to the same parsers trained on data belonging to a single target domain.",
        "Last but not least, it should be noted that the performance of ULISSE?Stp across the experiments carried out with pools of automatically parsed tokens of different sizes is in line with the behaviour of the ULISSE ranking algorithm (Dell?Orletta et al., 2011), where increasingly wider top lists of parsed tokens show decreasing LAS scores.",
        "This helps explaining why the performance of ULISSE?Stp starts decreasing after a certain threshold when wider top?lists of tokens are added to the parser training data."

        "In this paper we explored a new self?training method for domain adaptation where the selection of reliable parses within automatically annotated texts is carried out by an unsupervised linguistically?driven algorithm, ULISSE.",

        "Thanks to these properties the proposed self?training method is able to improve the parser performances when tested in an out?domain scenario.",
        "The same approach could in principle be applied to deal with biomedical sub?domain variation: as reported by (Lippincott, Se?aghdha, & Korhonen, 2011), biomedical texts belonging to different sub?domains do vary along many linguistic dimensions, with a potential negative impact on biomedical NLP tools."
