        "Despite the growing interest to biomedical question answering (Cairns et al., 2012; Ni et al., 2012; Bauer and Berleant, 2012), consumer health question answering remains a fairly understudied area of research.",
        "The initial research has focused on the analysis of consumer language (McCray et al., 1999) and the types of questions they asked.",
        "Spink et al. (2004) found that health-related queries submitted to three web search engines in 2001 were often advice seeking and personalized, and fell into five major categories: general health, weight issues, reproductive health and puberty, pregnancy/obstetrics, and human relationships.",
        "Observing that health queries constituted no more than 9.5% of all queries and declined over time, they concluded that the users turn more to the specialized resources for the answers to health-related questions.",
        "Similar to the findings of Zhang (2010), Beloborodov et al.",
        "(2013) found that diseases and symptoms were the most popular topics in a resource similar to Yahoo Answers, Otvety@Mail.Ru.",
        "They analyzed Otvety@Mail.Ru questions by mapping questions to body parts and organs, applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation method with Gibbs sampling to discover topics, and using a knowledge-based method to classify questions as evidence-directed or hypothesis-directed.",
        "First efforts in automated consumer health question processing were to classify the questions using machine learning techniques.",
        "In one study, frequently asked questions about diabetes were classified according to two somewhat orthogonal taxonomies: according to the ?medical type of the question?",
        "(Causes, Diagnostic, Prevention, Symptoms, Treatment, etc.)",
        "and according to the ?expected answer type?",
        "(Boolean, Causal, Definition, Factoid, Person, Place, etc.)",
        "(Cruchet et al., 2008).",
        "Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification achieved an F-score in low 80s in classifying English questions to the expected answer type.",
        "The results for French and medical type classification in both languages were much lower.",
        "Liu et al. (2011) found that SVM trained to distinguish questions asked by consumers from those posed by healthcare professionals achieve F-scores in the high 80s - low 90s.",
        "One of distinguishing characteristics of the consumer questions in Liu et al's study was the significantly higher use of personal pronouns (compared to professional questions).",
        "This feature was found to be useful for machine learning; however, the abundance of pronouns in the long dense questions is also a potential source of failure in understanding the question.",
        "Vicedo and Ferr?ndez (2000) have shown that pronominal anaphora resolution improves several aspects of the QA systems?",
        "performance.",
        "This observation was supported by Harabagiu et al. (2005) who have manually resolved coreference and ellipsis for 14 of the 25 scenarios in the TREC 2005 evaluation.",
        "Hickl et al. (2006) have incorporated into their question answering system a heuristic based question coreference module that resolved referring expressions in the question series to antecedents mentioned in previous questions or in the target description.",
        "To our knowledge, coreference and ellipsis resolution has not been previously attempted in consumer health question understanding.",
        "Another essential aspect in processing consumer questions is defining a formal representation capable of capturing all important points needed for further processing in automatic query generation (in the systems that use document passage retrieval to find a set of potential answers) and answer extraction and unification.",
        "Ontologies provide effective representation mechanisms for concepts, whereas relations are better captured in frame-like or event-related structures (Hunter and Cohen, 2006).",
        "Frame-based representation of extracted knowledge has a long-standing tradition in the biomedical domain, for example, in MedLEE (Friedman et al., 1994).",
        "Demner-Fushman et al. (2011) showed that frame-based representation of clinical questions improve identification of patients eligible for cohort inclusion.",
        "Demner-Fushman and Ab-hyankar (2012) extracted frames in four steps: 1) identification of domain concepts, 2) extraction of patient demographics (e.g., age, gender) and social history, 3) establishing dependencies between the concepts using the Stanford dependency parser (de Marneffe et al., 2006), and 4) adding concepts not involved in the relations to the",
        "frame as a list of keywords.",
        "Event-based representations have also seen increasing use in recent years in biomedical text mining, with the availability of biological event corpora, including GENIA event (Kim et al., 2008) and GREC (Thompson et al., 2009), and shared task challenges (Kim et al., 2012).",
        "Most state-of-the-art systems address the event extraction task by adopting machine learning techniques, such as dual composition-based models (Riedel and McCallum, 2011), stacking-based model integration (McClosky et al., 2012), and domain adaptation (Miwa et al., 2012).",
        "Good performance has also been reported with some rule-based systems (Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2012).",
        "Syntactic dependency parsing has been a key component in all state-of-the-art event extraction systems, as well.",
        "The role of coreference resolution in event extraction has recently been acknowledged (Kim et al., 2012), even though efforts in integrating coreference resolution into event extraction pipelines have generally resulted in only modest improvements (Yoshikawa et al., 2011; Miwa et al., 2012; Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2012).",
        "Coreference resolution has also been tackled in open domain natural language processing.",
        "State-of-the-art systems often employ a combination of lexical, syntactic, shallow semantic and discourse information (e.g., speaker identification) with deterministic rules (Lee et al., 2011).",
        "Interestingly, coreference resolution is one research area, in which deterministic frameworks generally outperform machine learning models (Haghighi and Klein, 2009; Lee et al., 2011).",
        "In contrast to coreference resolution, ellipsis resolution remains an understudied NLP problem.",
        "One type of ellipsis that received some attention is null instantiation (Fillmore and Baker, 2001), whereby the goal is to recover the referents for an uninstantiated semantic role of a target predicate from the wider discourse context.",
        "A semantic evaluation challenge that focused on null instantiation was proposed, although participation was limited (Ruppenhofer et al., 2010).",
        "Gerber and Chai (2012) focused on implicit argumentation (i.e., null instantiation) for nominal predicates.",
        "They annotated a corpus of implicit arguments for a small number of nominal predicates and trained a discriminative model based on syntactic, semantic and discourse features collected from various linguistic resources.",
        "Focusing on a different type of ellipsis, Bos and Spenader (2011) annotated a corpus of verb phrase ellipsis; however, so far there have been little work in verb phrase ellipsis resolution.",

        "Frame extraction without anaphora/ellipsis resolution (indicated as A in Table 4 below)",

        "Frame extraction with anaphora/ellipsis resolution (B) ?",

        "In the second column, the numbers in parentheses correspond to the numbers of correctly identified frames.",
        "The evaluation results show that the dependency-based frame extraction method with dictionary lookup is generally effective; it is precise in identifying frames, even though it misses many relevant frames, typical of most rule-based systems.",
        "On the other hand, anaphora/ellipsis resolution helps a great deal in recovering the relevant frames and only has a minor negative effect on precision of the frames, the overall effect being significantly positive.",
        "Note also that the increase in recall without gold triggers/named entities is about 40%, while that with gold triggers/named entities is more than double, indicating that accurate term recognition contributes to better anaphora/ellipsis resolution and, in turn, to better question understanding.",
        "The dictionary-based named entity/trigger/ question cue detection is relatively simple, and while it yields good precision, the lack of terms in the corresponding dictionary causes recall errors.",

        "Similarly, dependency-based frame construction is straightforward in that it mostly requires direct dependency relations between the trigger and the arguments.",
        "While the two additional rules we implemented redress the shortcomings of this straightforward approach, there are cases in which dependency-based mechanism is still lacking.",
        "An example is given in (7).",

        "My lower back doesn't seem to work, and I wonder if I will ever be able to walk up stairs or run.",
        "The system recognized that the trigger wonder had an uninstantiated theme argument, which it attempted to recover by ellipsis processing.",
        "However, this processing misidentified the case as legitimate ellipsis due to the dependency relations wonder is involved in.",
        "A more sophisticated approach would take into account specific selectional restrictions of predicates like wonder; however, the overall utility of such linguistic knowledge in the context of consumer health questions, which are often ungrammatical and not particularly well-written, remains uncertain.",

        "We will also continue to develop our anaphora/ellipsis processing module, addressing the issues revealed by our evaluation as well as other anaphoric phenomena, such as recognition of pleonastic it."
