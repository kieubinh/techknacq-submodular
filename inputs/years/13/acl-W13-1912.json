        "Input speed is often prioritised over completeness and grammatical correctness in health record narratives.",
        "This has the effect that lower results are achieved when parsers trained on standard text are applied on clinical text (Hassel et al., 2011).",
        "Syntactic annotations to use for training a parser on clinical text are, however, expensive (Albright et al., 2013) and treebanking large clinical corpora is therefore not always an option for smaller languages (Haverinen et al., 2009).",
        "There are studies on adaptation of standard parsers to the biomedical domain, focusing on overcoming difficulties due to different vocabulary use (Candito et al., 2011).",
        "How to overcome difficulties due to syntactic differences between standard and clinical language is, however, less studied.",
        "The aim of this study was therefore to explore syntactic differences between clinical language and standard language and to analyse errors made by the parser on sentence types typical to the clinical domain.",
        "To exemplify how this knowledge can be used, two simple preprocessing rules for improving parser performance on these typical sentences were developed."

        "To find sentence types typical to the clinical domain, a comparison to standard text was conducted.",
        "The used clinical corpus was: free-text entries from assessment sections, thus mostly containing diagnostic reasoning, that were randomly selected from the Stockholm EPR corpus1 (Dalia-nis et al., 2009); and the used standard corpus was: La?kartidningen (Kokkinakis, 2012), a journal from the Swedish Medical Association.",
        "The comparison was carried out on part-of-speech sequences on a sentence level.",
        "The part-of-speech tagger Granska (Carlberger and Kann, 1999), having an accuracy of 92% on clinical text (Hassel et al., 2011), was applied on both corpora, and the proportion of each sentence tag sequence was calculated.",
        "?Sentence tag sequence?",
        "refers here to the parts-of-speech corresponding to each token in the sentence, combined to one unit, e.g. ?dt nn vb nn mad?",
        "for the sentence ?The patient has headache.?.",
        "Pronouns, nouns and proper names were collapsed into one class, as they often play the same role in the sentence, and as terms specific to the clinical domain are tagged inconsistently as either nouns or proper names (Hassel et al., 2011).",
        "As sentences from La?kartidningen not ending with a full stop or a question mark are less likely to be full sentences, they were not included, in order to obtain a more contrasting corpus.",
        "A 95% confidence interval for the proportion of each sentence combination was computed using the Wilson score interval, and the difference between the minimum frequency in the clinical corpus and the maximum frequency in the standard language corpus was calculated.",
        "Thereby, statistics for the minimum difference between the two domains was achieved.",
        "A total of 458 436 sentence types were found in the clinical corpus.",
        "Of these, there were 1 736 types significantly more frequent in the clinical corpus than in the standard corpus, not having overlapping confidence interval for the proportions.",
        "33 sentence types, to which 10% of the sentences in the corpus belonged, had more than 0.1 percentage points difference between minimum frequency in the clinical corpus and maximum frequency in the standard language corpus.",
        "For each of these 33 sentence types, 30 sentences were randomly extracted and the dependency parser Malt-Parser (Nivre et al., 2009), pre-trained on Talbanken (Nivre et al., 2006) using the algorithm stacklazy (Nivre et al., 2009), was applied to these part-of-speech tagged sentences.",
        "Error categories were manually identified, using MaltEval (Nilsson and Nivre, 2008) for visualisation.",
        "Given the identified error categories, two preprocessing rules were constructed.",
        "These were then evaluated by applying the same pre-trained parser model on preprocessed sentences as on original sentences.",
        "A manual analysis was performed on a subset of the sentences that were differently parsed after pre-processing."

      "text": [
        "Although only one sentence type was a full sentence (nn vb pp nn mad), most sentences were correctly parsed.",
        "Omitted words could be inferred from context, and therefore also the intended syntax.",
        "Eight error types, to which most errors belonged, were identified: 1) Abbreviated words ending with a full stop interpreted as the last word in a sentence, resulting in an incorrect sentence splitting.",
        "2) Abbreviations incorrectly labelled as nouns by Granska, resulting in sentences exclusively containing nouns.",
        "3) Adjectives not recognised as such (often because they were abbreviated), resulting in AT relations being labelled as DT relations.",
        "4) A general adverbial relation incorrectly assigned an adverb of place or time relation or vice versa.",
        "5) The first word in compound expressions parsed as a determiner to the second.",
        "6) nn pp nn pp nn mad sentences for which a preposition had been incorrectly attributed.",
        "7) The sentence type nn jj (noun adjective), for which most evaluated sentences were incorrectly parsed.",
        "8) An omitted initial subject, resulting in the object incorrectly being parsed as the subject of the sentence.",
        "Pre-processing rules were constructed for error types 7) and 8).",
        "As a verb in the middle of nn jj-sentences (in most cases copula) was left out, the first preprocessing rule added copula in the middle of these sentences.",
        "The second rule added the pronoun I as the first word in sentences starting with a verb, as this was the most frequently left out subject, along with the slightly less frequent omission, patient.",
        "The rules were not applied on sentences ending with a question mark.",
        "10 (out of 33) sentence types were affected by the two rules.",
        "The proportion of those receiving a different parsing after preprocessing is shown in the column Changed in Table 1.",
        "A subset of these sentences, for which the parsing was changed, was manually classified as either incorrect (= containing at least one parsing or labelling error) or completely correct.",
        "For sentences classified as incorrect, a more granular comparison between the original and the modified parsing was carried out.",
        "For these sentences, the difference in average unlabelled (UAS) and labelled (LAS) attachment score between the preprocessed and the original parsing was computed.",
        "A positive value indicates that although the preprocessing resulted in some incorrectly parsed sentences, these sentences were improved by preprocessing.",
        "The sentence types vb pp nn nn mad and vb pp nn pp nn mad were thus slightly improved by the pre-processing, although they had a low proportion of correctly parsed sentences.",
        "A negative value for attachment score difference, on the other hand, indicates that parsing for the incorrectly parsed sentences was impaired by pre-processing.",
        "As these figures only apply to sentences incorrectly parsed after pre-processing, this means that although e.g. the type vb ab nn mad has negative UAS and LAS difference, this only applies to the 3 sentences that were incorrectly parsed by the preprocessed version.",
        "With one important exception, sentences modified by pre-processing, were either a) given a completely correct parsing and labelling in between 64% and 100% of the cases, or were b) slightly improved by pre-processing.",
        "A reasonable simplification in this case is that there can only be one correct parsing of a sentence, as although there might be occurrences of syntactically ambiguous sentences, it is unlikely that their interpretation is not given by the context in the closed domain of language used for diagnostic reasoning.",
        "Given this simplification, this means that a sentence was transformed from an incorrectly parsed sentence to a correctly parsed sentence in 64% or more of the cases, when preprocessing was applied.",
        "The difference in attachment score shows that the parsing is not drastically degraded for the rest of the sentences, although it mostly changed to a worse parsing.",
        "The overall effect of applying preprocessing is therefore positive.",
        "Sentences of the type vb nn pp nn mad is the important exception to this positive effect, important as 54% of the sentences belonging to this type received a different parsing after preprocessing and as 0.39% of the sentences in the corpus belong to this type.",
        "Only 61% of the preprocessed sentences of this type had a correct unlabelled parsing and only 32% had a correct labelled parsing.",
        "Many of these sentences were similar to Writes a prescription of Trombyl, for which of Trombyl incorrectly is given the word write as the head after pre-processing.",
        "Almost all of the sentences of the type nn jj mad were correctly parsed when a copula was inserted between the noun and the adjective.",
        "Of the other types of sentences that improved, many improved by an incorrectly labelled subject relation being changed to an object relation.",
        "There were, however, also improvements because some adverbs of place and time were correctly labelled after the preprocessing rules had been applied."

      "text": [
        "Even if quantitative data is given in Table 1, the core of this study has been to use a qualitative approach: searching for different categories of errors rather than determining accuracy figures, and investigating whether preprocessing has a positive effect, rather than determining the final accuracy.",
        "The next step is to apply the findings of this study for developing a small treebank of clinical text.",
        "A possible method for facilitating syntactic annotation is to present pre-annotated data to the annotator (Brants and Plaehn, 2000) for correction or for selection among several alternatives.",
        "As the overall effect of applying preprocessing were improved parsings, the pre-annotation could be carried out by applying a model trained on standard language and improve it with the preprocessing rules investigated here.",
        "The other identified error types also give suggestions of how to improve the parser, improvements that should be attempted before using a parser trained on standard language for pre-annotation.",
        "Error types 1), 2) and partly 3) were due to abbreviations negatively affecting part-of-speech tagging and sentence splitting.",
        "Therefore, abbreviation expansion would be a possible way of improving the parser.",
        "That available medical vocabularies also could be useful is shown by error type 5), which was due to the parser failing to recognise compound expressions.",
        "Of the sentences in the corpus, only 10% belonged to the analysed sentence types, and even fewer were affected by the evaluated preprocessing rules.",
        "It is, however, likely that the two developed preprocessing rules have effects on all sentence types lacking a verb or starting with a verb, thus effecting more sentence type than those included in this study.",
        "This is worth studying, as is also syntactic differences for shorter part-of-speech sequences than sentence level sequences.",
        "Another possible method for domain adaptation would be to adapt the training data to construct a model more suitable for parsing clinical text.",
        "Instead of applying pre-processing, sentences in the training data could be modified to more closely resemble sentences in clinical text, e.g. by removing words in the treebank corpus to achieve the incomplete sentences typical to clinical text.",
        "Differences in vocabulary has not been included in this study, but methods from previous studies for bridging differences in vocabulary between the general and medical domain could also be applied for improving parser performance.",
        "For supplementing a treebank to also include sentences typical to clinical text, some of the methods investigated here for extracting such sentence types, could be employed"

        "Sentence types typical to clinical text were extracted, and eight categories of error types were identified.",

        "As the preprocessing rules had an overall positive effect on the parser performance, it was suggested that a model for syntactic pre-annotation of clinical text should employ the evaluated text pre-processing."
