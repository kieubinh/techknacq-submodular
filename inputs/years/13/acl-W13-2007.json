        "As semantic resources in the biomedical domain, including ontologies and linked data, increase, there is a demand for semantic querying over the biomedical literature, instead of the keyword searching supported by conventional search engines (e.g. PubMed).",
        "The semantic search requires adapting Semantic Web technologies to the literature, to analyze the complex semantics described in biomedical documents and to represent them with ontology concepts and relations.",
        "The ontology-based formal semantics will then form a Semantic Web.",
        "The GRO task of the BioNLP Shared Tasks 2013 is to provide a platform to develop and evaluate systems for identifying complex semantic representation of biomedical documents in the domain of gene regulation.",
        "There are solutions for servicing the ontology concepts recognized in the biomedical literature, including TextPresso (M?ller et al., 2004) and GoPubMed (Doms and Schroeder, 2005).",
        "They utilize term recognition methods to locate the occurrences of ontology terms, together with terminological variations.",
        "Systems like EBIMed (Rebholz-Schuhmann et al., 2007) and FACTA (Tsuruoka et al., 2008) go further to collect and display co-occurrences of ontology terms.",
        "However, they do not extract events and relations of the semantic types defined in ontologies.",
        "The annotation of those ontology event and relation instances described in text was initiated in the biomedical domain by the GENIA corpus (Kim et al., 2003), and the tasks of the BioNLP Shared Tasks 2009 and 2011 aimed at automatically identifying such ontological annotations.",
        "However, the tasks dealt only with a small number of ontology concepts (less than 20 unique concepts in total), considering the thousands of concepts defined in standard biomedical ontologies (e.g. Gene Ontology, anatomy ontologies).",
        "The goal of the Gene Regulation Ontology (GRO) task is to confirm if text mining techniques can be scaled up to cover hundreds of (and eventually thousands of) concepts, and thereby to address the complex semantic representation of biomedical documents.",
        "The GRO task is to automatically annotate biomedical documents with the Gene Regulation Ontology (Beisswanger et al., 2008).",
        "GRO is a",
        "conceptual model of gene regulation and includes 507 concepts, which are cross-linked to such standard ontologies as Gene Ontology and Sequence Ontology and are integrated into a deep hierarchical structure via is-a and part-of relations.",
        "Note that many of the GRO concepts are more specific than those used in the previous BioNLP Shared Tasks.",
        "The GRO is one of the first ontological resources that bring together different types of ontology concepts and relations in a coherent structure.",
        "It has two top-level categories of concepts, Continuant and Occurrent, where the Occurrent branch has concepts for processes that are related to the regulation of gene expression (e.g.",
        "Transcription, RegulatoryProcess), and the Continuant branch has concepts mainly for physical entities that are involved in those processes (e.g. Gene, Protein, Cell).",
        "It also defines semantic relations (e.g. hasAgent, locatedIn) that link the instances of the concepts.",
        "The GRO task in the BioNLP Shared Task (ST) 2013 assumes that the instances of Continuant concepts are provided and focuses on extracting the instances of the events and relations defined in the GRO.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: We describe the manual construction of the training and test datasets for the task in Section 2 and explain the evaluation criteria and the results in Section 3."
