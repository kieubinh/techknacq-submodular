        "Some of them use machine-learning techniques to automate the annotation process (Ciravegna, 2000).",
        "On one side, machine-learning techniques depend strongly on the amount and quality of provided training data sets and do not use information available in the ontology.",
        "On the other side, using the ontology to project its elements onto the text depends strongly on the richness of the ontology and may neglect important information available in texts.",
        "Our participation in the subtask 1 (entity detection and categorization) of the BB BioNLP-ST leverages the provided OntoBiotope ontology and the training and development data sets preprocessed using our annotation platform based on UIMA (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004) (section 2).",
        "We first tested, on the development set, a rule-based machine-learning algorithm (WHISK (Soderland et al., 1999)) that used training set examples (section 3).",
        "Its results are limited because of the weaknesses of training data (section 4).",
        "We, then, computed a rule-based automatic ontology projection method consisting in retrieving from the text field information content provided by the ontology (eg.",
        "name of the concept).",
        "Thanks to the wealth of the OntoBiotope ontology, this method gave good results (section 5) that have been improved by adding a rote learning technique that uses training examples and some filtering techniques (section 6).",
        "Finally, we combined our method with WHISK results, which slightly improved the F-measure (section 7) on the development data."
