        "However, extensive biological insight is often required to develop text mining techniques that can be readily used by biomedical experts.",
        "Profiling biomedical research literature was among the first approaches in disease-gene prediction and is now becoming invaluable to researchers (Piro and Di Cunto, 2012; Moreau and Tranchevent, 2012).",
        "Information from publication repositories was often merged with other databases.",
        "Successful examples of such integration include an OMIM database on human genes and genetic phenotypes (Amberger et al., 2011), GeneRIF function annotation database (Osborne et al., 2006), Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000) and clinical information about drugs in the DailyMed database (Polen et al., 2008).",
        "Biomedical literature mining is a powerful way to identify promising candidate genes for which abundant knowledge might already be available.",
        "Relation extraction (Sarawagi, 2008) can identify semantic relationships between entities from text and is one of the key information extraction tasks.",
        "Because of the abundance of publications in molecular biology computational methods are required to convert text into structured data.",
        "Early relation extraction systems typically used hand-crafted rules to extract a small set of relation types (Brin, 1999).",
        "Later, machine learning methods were adapted to support the task and were trained over a set of predefined relation types.",
        "In cases where no tagged data is available, some unsupervised techniques offer the extraction of relation descriptors based on syntactic text properties (Bach and Badaskar, 2007).",
        "Current state-of-the-art systems achieve best results by combining both machine learning and rule-based approaches (Xu et al., 2012).",
        "Information on gene interactions are scattered in data resources such as PubMed.",

        "There the task is to identify pairs of entities and assign them a relation type.",
        "A number of machine learning techniques have been used for relation extraction, such as sequence classifiers, including HMM (Freitag and McCallum, 2000), CRF (Lafferty et al., 2001) and MEMM (Kamb-hatla, 2004), and binary classifiers.",
        "The latter most oftem employ SVM (Van Landeghem et al., 2012).",
        "The ACE 2004 data set (Mitchell et al., 2005) contains two-tier hierarchical relation types.",
        "Thus, a relation can have another relation as an attribute and second level relation must have only atomic attributes.",
        "Therefore, two-tier relation hierarchies have the maximum height of two.",
        "Wang et al. (2006) employed a one-against-one SVM classifier to predict relations in ACE 2004 data set using semantic features from WordNet (Miller, 1995).",
        "The BioNLP 2013 GRN Shared Task aims to detect three-tier hierarchical relations.",
        "These relations describe interactions that can have events or other interactions as attributes.",
        "In contrast to pairwise approach of Wang et al. (2006), we extract relations with sequence classifiers and rules.",
        "The same relation in text can be expressed in many forms.",
        "Machine-learning approaches can resolve this heterogeneity by training models on large data sets using a large number of feature functions.",

        "An approach to overcome low coverage of different relation forms was proposed by Garcia and Gamallo (2011).",
        "They introduced a lexico-syntactic pattern-based feature functions that identify dependency heads and extracts relations.",
        "Their approach was evaluated over two relation types in two languages and achieved good results.",
        "In our study we use rules to account for the heterogeneity of relation representation.",
        "Generally, when trying to solve a relation extraction task, data sets are tagged using the IOB (inside-outside-beginning) notation (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995), such that the first word of the relation is tagged as B-REL, other consecutive words within it as I-REL and all others as O.",
        "The segment of text that best describes a predefined relation between two entities is called a relation descriptor.",
        "Li et al. (2011) trained a linear-chain CRF to uncover these descriptors.",
        "They also transformed subject and object mentions of the relations into dedicated values that enabled them to correctly predict relation direction.",
        "Additionally, they represented the whole relation descriptor as a single word to use long-range features with a first-order model.",
        "We use a similar model but propose a new way of token sequence transformation which discovers the exact relation and not only the descriptor.",
        "Banko and Etzioni (2008) used linear models for the extraction of open relations (i.e. extraction of general relation descriptors without any knowledge about specific target relation type).",
        "They first characterized the type of relation appearance in the text according to lexical and syntactic patterns and then trained a CRF using these data along with synonym detection (Yates and Etzioni, 2007).",
        "Their method is useful when a few relations in a massive corpus are unknown.",
        "However, if higher levels of recall are desired, traditional relation extraction is a better fit.",
        "In this study we therefore propose a completely super",
        "vised relation extraction method.",
        "Methods for biomedical relation extraction have been tested within several large evaluation initiatives.",
        "The Learning language in logic (LLL) challenge on genic interaction extraction (Ne?dellec, 2005) is similar to the BioNLP 2013 GRN Shared Task, which contains a subset of the LLL data set enriched with additional annotations.",
        "Giu-liano et al. (2006) solved the task using an SVM classifier with a specialized local and global context kernel.",
        "The local kernel uses only mention-related features such as word, lemma and part-of-speech tag, while the global context kernel compares words that appear on the left, between and on the right of two candidate mentions.",
        "To detect relations, they select only documents containing at least two mentions and generate",
        "ing examples, where n is the number of all mentions in a document and k is number of mentions that form a relation (i.e. two).",
        "They then predict three class values according to direction (subject-object, object-subject, no relation).",
        "Our approach also uses context features and syntactic features of neighbouring tokens.",
        "The direction of relations predicted in our model is arbitrary and it is further determined using rules.",
