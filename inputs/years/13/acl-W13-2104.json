        "As noted in the preceding section, the lexicalized categories for connectives o?ered therein suggest that there is no problem in principle with devising a purely lexicalized approach to discourse connectives; accordingly, the cue threading approach presented in this section appears to yield grammars with coverage equivalent to purely lexicalized alternatives.",

        "In addition to expressing an explicit preference for serial rather than back-and-forth textplans, subjects also commented that higher level contrastive adverbials like however work better when they are used sparingly at a high level, reinforcing the findings in our regressions.",
        "We also received suggestions for future work improving the expression of contrast: some subjects suggested that using better and worse to make explicit comparisons between restaurants would improve the naturalness, and one subject suggested explicitly stating which restaurant is (say) the cheapest as in White et al. (2010)."

        "In this paper, we have shown using ratings gathered on AMT that Nakatsu & White's (2010) proposed enhancements to the SPaRKy Restaurant Corpus (Walker et al., 2007) for better expressing contrast do indeed make it possible to generate better texts, and an initial experiment suggested that even a basic n-gram ranker can do so automatically.",
        "A regression analysis further revealed that while using a few discourse adverbials sparingly was effective, using too many discourse adverbials had a negative impact, with antecedent distance potentially an important factor.",
        "In future work, we plan to improve upon this basic n-gram ranker to take these observations into account and validate these initial findings on a larger dataset.",
