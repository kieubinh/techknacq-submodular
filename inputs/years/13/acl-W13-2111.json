        "The KBGen 2013 natural language generation challenge1 was intended to survey and compare the performance of various systems which perform tasks in the content realization stage of generation (Banik et al., 2012).",
        "Given a set of relations which form a coherent unit, the task is to generate complex sentences which are grammatical and fluent in English.",
        "The relations for this year's challenge were selected from the AURA knowledge base (KB) (Gunning et al., 2010).",

        "1).",

        "For example, whether two entities are connected by has-part or has-region is unlikely to make a difference to the coherence of a content unit.",
        "Following this approach we identified groups of semantically similar relations within each relation type (Event-to-Event, Event-to-Entity, etc).",
        "The equivalence classes over relations were straightforwardly derived from distinctions made in CLIB (Barker et al., 2001), the upper ontology and library of general concepts that AURA is built on, although there was some manual fine-tuning required to exclude relations which were not reliably encoded in the KB.",
        "For example, we divided Entity-to-Entity relations into three categories, based on whether they had a spatial or meronymic sense, or expressed a specific relation between two chemicals: en2en-spatial: abuts is-above is-along is-at is-inside is-opposite is-outside is-over location",

        "Here we used the categories of spatial relations and ?participant?",
        "relations from CLIB.",
        "Our terminology reflects the fact that entities connected to an event by a core-participant relation are typically expressed as obligatory arguments of the verb in a sentence, whereas aux-participants would be expressed as optional modifiers: core-participants: agent object donor base instrument raw-material recipient result aux-participants: away-from destination origin path site toward With these definitions, the specific query illustrated above in section 3.2 was translated to the following query pattern:"
