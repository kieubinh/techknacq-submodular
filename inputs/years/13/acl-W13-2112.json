        "In (Bouayad-Agha et al., 2012), we presented the NLG challenge of content selection from semantic web data.",
        "The task to perform was described as follows: given a set of RDF triples containing facts about a celebrity, select those triples that are reflected in the target text (i.e., a short biography about that celebrity).",
        "The task first required a data preparation stage that involved the following two subtasks: 1) data gathering and preparation, that is, deciding which data and texts to use, then downloading and pairing them, and 2) working dataset selection and annotation, that is, defining the criteria/guidelines for determining when a triple is marked as selected in the target text, and producing a corpus of triples annotated for selection.",
        "There were initially nine interested participants (including the two organizing parties).",
        "Five of which participated in the (voluntary) triple annotation rounds.1 In the end, only two participants submitted their systems: 1We would like to thank Angelos Georgaras and Stasinos Konstantopoulos from NCSR (Greece) for their participation in the annotation rounds.",

        "UIC: Hareen Venigalla and Barbara Di iEugenio.",
        "Before the presentation of the baseline evaluation of the submitted systems and the discussion of the results (Section 4), we outline the two data preparation subtasks (Sections 2 and 3).",
        "In Section 5, we then sketch some conclusions with regard to the achievements and future of the content selection task challenge.",
        "More details about the data, annotation and resources described in this overview, as well as links for downloading the data and other materials (e.g., evaluation results, code, etc.)",

        "We chose Freebase as our triple datastore.3,4 We obtained the triple set for each person in the Turtle format (ttl) by grepping the official Freebase RDF dump released on the 30th of December 2012 for all triples whose subject is the person's URI; certain meta-data and irrelevant triples (i.e., triples with specific namespaces such as ?base?",
        "or ?common?)",

        "Each triple set is paired with the person's summary biography typically available in Wikipedia, which consists of the first paragraph(s) preceding the page's table of contents5 Our final corpus consists of 60000+ pairs, all of which follow two restrictions that are supposed to",
        "maximize the chances of having interesting pairs with sufficient original and selected input triples for the challenge.",
        "Firstly, the number of unique predicates in the input ttl must be greater than 10.",
        "The number 10 is estimated based on the fact that a person's nationality, date and place of birth, profession, type and gender are almost always available and selected, such that we need a somewhat large set to select content from in order to make the task minimally challenging.",
        "Secondly, the Wikipedia-extracted summary biography must contain more than 5 anchors and at least 20% of the available anchors, where an anchor is a URI in the text (i.e., external href attribute value in the html) pointing to another Wikipedia article which is directly related to that person.",
        "Given that most Freebase topics have a corresponding DBPedia entity with a Wikipedia article, anchors found in the introductory text are an indicator of potential relevant facts available in Freebase and are communicated in the text.",
        "In other words, the anchor threshold restriction is useful to discard pairs with very few triples to annotate.",
        "We found this criterion more reliable than the absolute length of the text which is not necessarily proportional with the number of triples available for that person."

        "In the first round, participants were asked to select content for the same three celebrities.",
        "The objectives of this annotation, in which five individuals belonging to four distinct institutions participated, were 1) for participants to get acquainted with the content selection task envisaged, the domain and guidelines, 2) to validate the guidelines, and 3) to formally evaluate the complexity of the task by calculating inter-annotator agreement.",
        "For the latter we used free-marginal multi-rater Kappa, as it seemed suited for the annotation task (i.e. independent ratings, discrete categories, multiple raters, annotators are not restricted in how they distribute categories across cases) (Justus, 2005).",
        "We obtained an average Kappa of 0.92 across the three pairs for the 5 annotators and 2 categories (selected, not selected), which indicates a high level of agreement and therefore validates our annotation guidelines.",
        "Our objective for the second round of annotations was to obtain a dataset for participants to work with.",
        "In the end, we gathered 344 pairs from 5 individuals of 5 distinct institutions.",
        "It should be noted that although both rounds of annotations follow the anchor restriction presented in Section 2, the idea to set a minimum number of predicates for the larger corpus of 60000+ pairs came forth after analysing the results of the second round and noting the data sparsity in some pairs.",

        "Both of the presented systems were data-intensive in that they usedeither a pool of textual knowledge or the corpus of triple data provided by the challenge in order to select the most relevant data.",
        "Unlike several previous challenges that involve more traditional NLG tasks (e.g., surface realization, referring expression generation), content selection from large input semantic data is a relatively new research endeavour in the NLG community that coincides with the rising interest in statistical approaches to NLG and dates back, to the best of our knowledge, to (Duboue and McK-eown, 2003).",
        "Furthermore, although we had initially planned to produce a training set for the task, the cost of manual annotation turned out to be prohibitive and the resulting corpus was only fit for development and baseline evaluation.",
        "Despite these setbacks, we believe that open semantic web data is a promising test-bed and application field for NLG-oriented content selection (Bouayad-Agha et al., 2013) and trust that this first challenge has prepared the ground for follow up challenges with a larger participation.",
        "We would also like to encourage researchers from NLG and Semantic Web research fields to exploit the framework and materials developed during the course of this challenge to advance research in content selection."
