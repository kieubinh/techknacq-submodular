        "not only should the summarizer identify salient information, but it should also synthesize the summary in a way that achieves certain argumentative purposes.",

        "follow-up article (2007), wherein they questioned the usefulness of state-of-the-art summarization methods in addressing users?",

        "As articulated by Sparck Jones (2007) and echoed by Nenkova and McKeown (2011), summarization needs to be viewed as a part of the larger discourse (academic writing) it belongs to, tailored to the purpose (literature review) of summarization, the reader (in this case, a researcher) and the genre being summarized (research papers).",
        "Motivated by this research gap, we outline the aims of our analyses: ?",

        "This paper investigates the human summarization process through an extensive discourse analysis.",
        "Human summarization is a process comprising document exploration to investigate the document macrostructure, relevance assessment by constructing a mental representation and summary production by selecting and transforming text from the source(s) (Endres-Niggemeyer, Maier, and Sigel, 1995).",
        "The underlying principle is the theory of human synthesis of information, by Van Dijk and Kintsch (1983).",
        "This study proposes a linguistically motivated framework for summarization.",
        "In previous work, a summarization framework developed by Marcu (2000) compressed information from general texts by identifying rhetorical relationships between clauses and sentences, and extracting sentence nuclei.",
        "Shiyan, Khoo & Goh (2008) summarized social science dissertation abstracts by referencing a social science taxonomy to identify important information and a specially constructed knowledge bank to identify important inter-relationships.",
        "In earlier work, a summarization framework designed by Teufel and Moens (2002) identified 7 categories of scientific arguments and extracted single-document summaries from chemistry and computational linguistics papers (Teufel, Siddharthan & Batchelor, 2009) based on user's queries.",
        "However, it required large corpora of manually annotated papers to be applied to any field, and it generated only single-document summaries.",
        "Some other scientific summarization systems aim to model information relationships accurately without concerning themselves with summary structure.",
        "Centrifuser, a framework for summarizing medical literature (Elhadad, Kan, Klavans and McKeown, 2005) produced a multi-document, query-focused indicative summary highlighting the similarities and differences between source documents.",
        "The topic tree for the final summary was constructed offline by clustering a large number of documents, thus it was not suitable for real-time user queries.",
        "In a related recent approach, Hoang and Kan (2010) presented preliminary results from automatically generating related work sections for a target paper by taking a hierarchical topic tree as an input; however, the requirement of a preconceived topic tree limits the scalability of this system.",
        "To sum up, these scientific summarization systems are typically delimited by their scalability and generalizability for multiple documents and domains.",
        "Newer approaches in scientific paper summarization rely on preselected information cited in other papers to judge whether information is influential or not, and generate a multi-document summary of a topic (Nanba, Kando & Okumura, 2011) or a single document summary for a paper using its relevant cited information (Qazvinian & Radev, 2008).",
        "A system for generating literature surveys through citations was proposed by Mohammad et al. (2009) which applied superficial analysis of research paper citation sentences to suggest model sentences; the present study describes parallel efforts to refine a summarization framework after extensive discourse analysis.",
        "We consider providing not just a synopsis of information, but also integrating the synopsis with the contextual and rhetorical features which make a human written literature review a coherent, cohesive and useful reference.",
        "Our study thus addresses a different, and more challenging, set of objectives than the citation-based summarizers of recent work."
