        "The huge amount of data generated every day in meetings calls for developing automated methods to efficiently process these data to meet users' needs.",
        "Automatic summarization is a popular task that can help users to browse a large amount of recorder speech in text format.",
        "This paper tackles the task of recorded meeting summarization, addressing the key limitations of existing approaches by proposing the following contributions: 1) Various approaches that were recently developed for meeting summarization (such as (Gillick et al., 2009; Garg et al., 2009)) focus on extracting important sentences (or dialogue acts) from speech transcripts, either manual transcripts or automatic speech recognition (ASR) output.",
        "However, it has been observed in the context of meeting summarization users generally prefer concise abstracts over extracts, and abstracts lead to higher objective task scores; likewise automatic abstractive summaries are preferred in comparison with human extracts (Murray et al., 2010).",
        "Moreover, most of the abstractive summarization approaches focus on one component of the system, such as generation (e.g., (Genest and Lapalme, 2010)) or content selection (e.g., (Murray et al., 2012)), instead of developing the full framework for abstractive summarization.",
        "To address these limitations, as the main contribution of this paper, we propose a full pipeline to generate an abstractive summary for each meeting transcript.",
        "Our system is similar to that of Murray et al. (2010) in terms of generating abstractive summaries for meeting transcripts.",
        "However, we take a lighter supervision for the content selection phase and a different approach towards the language generation phase, which does not rely on the conventional Natural Language Generation (NLG) architecture (Reiter and Dale, 2000).",
        "2) We propose a word graph based approach to aggregate and generate the abstractive sentence summary.",
        "Our work extends the word graph method proposed by Filippova (2010) with the following novel contributions: i) We take advantage of lexical knowledge to merge similar nodes by finding their relations in WordNet; ii) We generate new sentences through generalization and aggregation of the original ones, which means that our generated sentences are not necessarily composed of the original words; and iii) We adopt a new ranking strategy to select the best path in the graph by taking the information content and the grammaticality (i.e. fluency) of the sentence into consideration.",
        "3) In order to generate an abstract summary for a meeting, we have to be able to capture the overall content of the conversation.",
        "This can be done by identifying the essential content from the most informative sentences using the semantic relations among all sentences in a meeting transcript.",
        "However, most current methods disregard such relations in favor of statistical models of word distributions and frequencies.",
        "Moreover, the data from meeting transcripts often contains many highly redundant sentences.",
        "As one of the key contributions of this paper, we propose to build a multidirectional entailment graph over the sentences to identify and select relevant information from the most informative sentences.",
        "4) The textual data from meeting conversation transcripts are typically in a casual style and do not exhibit a clear syntactic structure with proper grammar and spelling.",
        "Therefore, abstractive summarization approaches developed for formal texts, such as scientific or news articles, often are not satisfactory when dealing with informal texts.",
        "Our proposed method for abstractive meeting summarization requires minimal syntactic and structural information and is robust in dealing with text that suffers from transcription errors, ill-formed sentences and unknown lexical choices such as typically formed in meeting transcripts.",
        "We evaluate our system over meeting transcripts.",
        "Our result compares favorably to the result of previous extractive and abstractive approaches in terms of information content.",
        "Moreover, we show that our method can generate longer sentences with competitive grammaticality scores, in comparison with previous abstractive approaches.",
        "Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of each component of our system through an ablation test.",
        "As an additional result of our experiments, we also show that using semantic relations (entailment graph) is important in efficiently performing the final step of our summarization pipeline (i.e., the sentence fusion).",
        "2 Abstractive Summarization Framework Similar to Murray et al. (2010), our goal is to generate a meeting summary, i.e. a set of sentences, that could capture the semantics of the meeting.",
        "While (Murray et al., 2010) requires extensive annotations to train several classifiers to detect important sentences, opinions and dialog acts, we only use a subset of that annotation, which includes a human abstract and links from each sentence in the abstract to the source meeting sentences.",
        "In addition, instead of generating an abstractive sentence via the conventional NLG pipeline (Reiter and Dale, 2000), we exploit a word graph approach.",

        "1 Figure 1: Meeting summarization framework.",
        "As shown in Figure 1, our framework consists of three main components, which we describe in more detail in the following sections.",
        "2.1 Community Detection While some abstractive summary sentences are very similar to original sentences from the meeting transcript, others can be created by aggregating and merging multiple sentences into an abstract sentence.",
        "In order to generate such a sentence, we need to identify which sentences from the original meeting transcript should be combined in generated abstract sentences.",
        "This task can be considered as the first step of abstractive meeting summarization and is called 'abstractive community detection (ACD)'",
        "(Murray et al., 2012).",
        "To perform ACD, we follow the same method proposed by Murray et al. (2012), in two steps: First, we classify sentence pairs according to whether or not they should be realized by a common abstractive sentence.",
        "For each pair, we extract its structural and linguistic features, and we train a logistic regression classifier over all our training data (described in Section 3.1) exploiting such features.",
        "We run the trained classier over sentence pairs, predicting abstractive links between sentences in the document.",
        "The result can be represented as an undirected graph where nodes are the sentences, and edges represent whether two nodes are linked.",
        "Second, we have to identify which nodes (i.e., sentences from the meeting transcript) can be clustered as a community to generate an abstract sentence.",
        "For this purpose, we apply the CONGA algorithm (Gregory, 2007) for community detection that uses betweenness to detect communities in a graph.",
        "The betweenness score for an edge is the number of shortest paths between pairs of nodes in the graph that run along that edge.",
        "If a sentence is not connected to at least one other sentence in the first step, it's assigned to its own singleton community.",
        "137 CD E F GA Bx x 1 Figure 2: Building an entailment graph over sentences.",
        "Arrows and 'x'",
        "represent the entailment direction and unknown cases respectively.",
        "2.2 Entailment Graph Sentences in a community often include redundant information which are semantically equivalent but vary in lexical choices.",
        "By identifying the semantic relations between the sentences in each community, we can discover the information in one sentence that is semantically equivalent, novel, or more/less informative with respect to the content of the other sentences.",
        "Similar to earlier work (Lloret et al., 2008; Mehdad et al., 2010; Berant et al., 2011; Adler et al., 2012; Mehdad et al., 2013), we set this problem as a variant of the Textual Entailment (TE) recognition task (Dagan and Glickman, 2004).",
        "We build an entailment graph for each community of sentences, where nodes are the linked sentences and edges are the entailment relations between nodes.",
        "Given two sentences (s1 and s2), we aim at identifying the following cases: i) s1 and s2 express the same meaning (bidirectional entailment).",
        "In such cases one of the sentences should be eliminated; ii) s1 is more informative than s2 (unidirectional entailment).",
        "In such cases, the entailing sentence should replace or complement the entailed one; iii) s1 contains facts that are not present in s2, and vice-versa (the 'unknown'",
        "cases in TE parlance).",
        "In such cases, both sentences should remain.",
        "Figure 2 shows how entailment relations can help in selecting the sentences by removing the redundant and less informative ones.",
        "As we show in the figure, the sentence 'A'",
        "entails 'E', 'F'",
        "and 'G', but not 'B'.",
        "So we can keep 'A'",
        "and 'B'",
        "and eliminate others.",
        "For example, the sentence 'we should discuss about the remote control and its color'",
        "entails 'about the remote', 'let's talk about the remote'",
        "and 'um remote's color', but not 'remote's size is also important'.",
        "So we can keep 'we should discuss about the remote control and its color' and 'remote's size is also important' and eliminate the others.",
        "In this way, TE-based sentence identification can be designed to distinguish meaning-preserving variations from true divergence, regardless of lexical choices and structures.",
        "Similar to previous approaches in TE (e.g., (Berant et al., 2011)), we use a supervised method.",
        "To train and build the entailment graph, we perform three steps described in the following subsections.",
        "2.2.1 Training set collection In the last few years, TE corpora have been created and distributed in the framework of several evaluation campaigns, including the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) Challenge1 and Cross-lingual textual entailment for content synchronization (Negri et al., 2012).",
        "However, such datasets cannot directly support our application, since the RTE datasets are often composed of longer well-formed sentences and paragraphs (Bentivogli et al., 2009; Negri et al., 2011).",
        "In order to collect a dataset that is more similar to the goal of our entailment framework, we select a subset of the sixth and seventh RTE challenge main task (i.e., RTE within a Corpus).",
        "Our dataset choice is based on the following reasons: i) the length of sentence pairs in RTE6 and RTE7 is shorter than the others, and ii) RTE6 and RTE7 main task datasets are originally created for summarization purpose, which is closer to our work.",
        "We sort the RTE6 and RTE7 dataset pairs based on the sentence length and choose the first 2000 samples with an equal number of positive and negative examples.",
        "The average length of words in our training data is 7 words.",
        "There are certainly some differences between our training set and our sentences from the meeting corpus.",
        "However, the collected training samples was the closest available dataset to our needs.",
        "2.2.2 Feature representation and training Working with meeting transcripts imposes some constraints on feature selection.",
        "Meeting transcripts are not often well-formed in terms of sen-1http://pascallin.ecs.soton.ac.uk/Challenges/RTE/ 2http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2013/task8/ 138 tence structure and contain errors.",
        "This limits our features to the lexical level.",
        "Fortunately, lexical models are less computationally expensive and easier to implement and often deliver a strong performance for RTE (Sammons et al., 2011).",
        "Our entailment decision criterion is based on similarity scores calculated with a sentence-to-sentence matching process.",
        "Each example pair of sentences (s1 and s2) is represented by a feature vector, where each feature is a specific similarity score estimating whether s1 entails s2.",
        "We compute 18 similarity scores for each pair of sentences.",
        "Before aggregating the similarity scores to form an entailment score, we normalize the similarity scores by the length of s2 (in terms of lexical items), when checking the entailment direction from s1 to s2.",
        "In this way, we can estimate the portion of information/facts in s2 which is covered by s1.",
        "The first five scores are computed based on the exact lexical overlap between the phrases: word overlap, edit distance, ngram-overlap, longest common subsequence and Lesk (Lesk, 1986).",
        "The other scores were computed using lexical resources: WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), VerbO-cean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), paraphrases (Denkowski and Lavie, 2010) and phrase matching (Mehdad et al., 2011).",
        "We used WordNet to compute the word similarity as the least common subsumer between two words considering the synonymy-antonymy, hypernymy-hyponymy, and meronymy relations.",
        "Then, we calculated the sentence similarity as the sum of the similarity scores of the word pairs in Text and Hypothesis, normalized by the number of words in Hypothesis.",
        "We also use phrase matching features described in (Mehdad et al., 2011) which consists of phrasal matching at the level on ngrams (1 to 5 tokens).",
        "The rationale behind using different entailment features is that combining various scores will yield a better model (Berant et al., 2011).",
        "To combine the entailment scores and optimize their relative weights, we train a Support Vector Machine binary classifier, SVMlight (Joachims, 1999), over an equal number of positive and negative examples.",
        "This results in an entailment model with 95% accuracy over 2-fold and 5-fold cross-validation, which further proves the effectiveness of our feature set for this lexical entailment model.",
        "The reason that we gained a very high accuracy is because our selected sentences are a subset of RTE6 and RTE7 with a shorter length (fewer words) which makes the entailment recognition task much easier than recognizing entailment between paragraphs or long sentences.",
        "2.2.3 Entailment graph edge labeling Since our training examples are labeled with binary judgments, we are not able to train a three-way classifier.",
        "Therefore, we set the edge labeling problem as a two-way classification task that casts multidirectional entailment as a unidirectional problem, where each pair is analyzed checking for entailment in both directions (Mehdad et al., 2012).",
        "In this condition, each original test example is correctly classified if both pairs originated from it are correctly judged ('YES-YES'",
        "for bidirectional,'YES-NO'",
        "and 'NO-YES'",
        "for unidirectional entailment and 'NO-NO'",
        "for unknown cases).",
        "Two-way classification represents an intuitive solution to capture multidimensional entailment relations.",
        "2.2.4 Identification and selection By assigning all entailment relations between the extracted sentence pairs, we identify relevant sentences to eliminate the redundant (in terms of meaning) and less informative ones.",
        "In order to perform this task we follow a set of rules based on the graph edge labels.",
        "Note that since entailment is a transitive relation, our entailment graph is transitive i.e., if entail(s1,s2) and entail(s2,s3) then entail(s1,s3) (Berant et al., 2011).",
        "Rule 1) Among the nodes that are connected with bidirectional entailment (semantically equivalent nodes) we keep only the one with more outgoing bidirectional and unidirectional entailment re-lations; Rule 2) If there is a chain of entailing nodes, we keep the one that is the root of the chain and eliminate others.",
        "2.3 Multi-sentence Fusion Sentence fusion is a well-known challenge for summarization systems.",
        "In this phase, our goal is to generate an understandable informative sentence that maximally captures the content of the sentences in a sentence community.",
        "There are several ways of generating an abstract sentence (e.g. (Barzilay and McKeown, 2005; Liu and Liu, 2009; Ganesan et al., 2010; Murray et al., 2010)); however, most of them rely heavily on the syntactic structure.",
        "We believe that such 139 we um should /must choose/ determine The remote control is because the cost/ price important /crucial use of uh Start End 1 Figure 3: Word graph constructed from sentences (1-4) and possible fusion paths.",
        "Double line nodes represent merged words in the graph.",
        "approaches are suboptimal, especially in dealing with written conversational data (e.g., email) or the data from speech transcripts, whether manual transcription or automatic speech recognition output.",
        "Instead, we apply an approach that does not rely on syntax, nor on a standard NLG architecture.",
        "More specifically, we build a word graph from all the words of the sentences in a community and aggregate them in order to generate a new abstractive sentence.",
        "We perform the task of multi-sentence fusion in two steps.",
        "First, we construct a word graph over sentences in each community that were selected from the entailment graph.",
        "Second, we rank the valid paths in the word graph and select the top path as the abstract sentence summary.",
        "2.3.1 Constructing a Word Graph In order to construct a word graph, our model extends the word graph method proposed by Filippova (2010) with the following novel contribu-tions: 1- The basic word graph method disregards semantic and lexical relations between the words in constructing the word graph, in favor of redundancy and word frequencies.",
        "To move beyond such limitation, we take advantage of lexical knowledge to map the similar nodes by finding their relations in WordNet.",
        "In this way, for exam-ple, two synonym words can be mapped into the same node.",
        "2- Filippova's approach is essentially extractive in nature, which means the generated sentence is composed by the same words from the original sentences.",
        "We move beyond this by generating new sentences through generalization and aggregation of the original ones.",
        "This means that our generated sentences are not necessarily composed of the original words.",
        "In this way, we are one step closer to abstractive summarization.",
        "3- Our proposed method aggregates and generates new readable sentences, regardless of their lengths, that can semantically imply several original sentences, by taking the information content and the readability (i.e. fluency) of the sentence into consideration.",
        "Following Filippova's method, given a set of related sentences, we build a word graph by iteratively adding sentences to it.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates a small graph composed of 4 sentences, including the start and end nodes.",
        "1- we must determine the use of uh remote.",
        "2- The remote control is important because the cost.",
        "3- um we should choose the control.",
        "4The remote price is crucial.",
        "As one of the main steps of word graph con-struction, we merge the words that have the same POS tags under the following conditions: 1) The words are identical (e.g.",
        "'remote').",
        "2) The words are synonyms.",
        "The replacement choice is based on the word's commonality, i.e. tfidf (e.g. 'important'",
        "and 'crucial').",
        "3) The words form a hypernym/hyponym pair or share a common hypernym.",
        "Both words are replaced by the hypernym (e.g. 'price'",
        "and 'cost').",
        "4) The words are in an entailment relation.",
        "Both words are replaced by the entailed one (e.g. 'pay'",
        "and 'buy').",
        "Note that, similar to Filippova's approach, where merging is ambiguous we check the context (a word before and after in the sentence and the neighboring nodes in the graph) and select the candidate that has larger overlap in the context, or the one with a greater frequency.",
        "Similar to the original word graph model, we connect adjacent words with directed edges.",
        "For the new nodes or unconnected nodes, we draw an edge with a weight of 1.",
        "In contrast, weights between already connected nodes are increased by 1.",
        "140 2.3.2 Path Selection and Ranking The word graph, as described above, will generate many sequences connecting start and end.",
        "How-ever, it is likely that most of the paths are not readable.",
        "Since we are aiming at generating a good abstractive sentence, some constraints need to be considered.",
        "A good abstractive sentence should cover most of the concepts that exist in the original sentences.",
        "Moreover, it should be grammatically correct.",
        "In order to satisfy these constraints we adopt a ranking strategy that combines the characteristics of a good summary sentence.",
        "To filter ungrammatical sentences, we prune the paths in which a verb does not exist.",
        "Our ranking formulation is summarized as below: Fluency: Our word graph process generates many possible paths as abstractive summaries.",
        "We need now to decide which of these paths are more readable and fluent.",
        "As in other areas of NLP (e.g. machine translation and speech recognition), the answer can be estimated by a language model.",
        "We assign a probability Pr(P ) to each path P based on a n-gram language model.Pr(P ) = mY i=1 Pr(pi|pi\u000011 ) '",

        "mX i=1 \u0000logPr(pi|pi\u00001i\u0000n+1) Coverage: To identify the summary with the highest coverage, we propose a second score that estimates the number of nouns that appear in the path.",

        "C overage(P ) = Ppi2P tfidf (pi)P pi2G tfidf (pi) where the pi are nouns and G is the graph.",
        "Edge weight: As a third score, we adopt the Filip-pova's edge weighting formulation w(pi, pj) and define the edge weight of the path W (P ) as be-low: w(pi, pj) = freq(pi) + freq(pj)P P2G pi,pj2P di'",
        "(P, pi, pj)\u00001W (P ) = Pm\u00001i=1 w(pi, pi+1)m\u0000 1 where the function diff(P, pi, pj) refers to the distance between the offset positions pos(P, pi) of words pi and pj in path P and is defined as |pos(P, pj) \u0000 pos(P, pi)| and m is the number of words in path P .",
        "Ranking score: In order to generate a summary sentence that combines the scores above, we employ a ranking model.",
        "The purpose of such a model is three-fold: i) to generate a more readable and grammatical sentence; ii) to cover the content of original sentences optimally; and iii) to favor strong connections between the concepts.",
        "Therefore, the final ranking score of path P is calculated over the normalized scores as:Score(P ) = Pr(P )'",
        "Coverage(P )W (P ) We select all the paths that contain at least one verb and rerank them using our proposed ranking function to find the best path as the summary of the original sentences.",
        "3 Experiments and Results We now describe a preliminary, formative evaluation of our framework, whose main goal is to assess strengths and weaknesses of the various components and generate ideas for further developments.",
        "3.1 Dataset To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we experiment with the AMI meeting corpus (Carletta et al., 2005) that consists of 140 multi-party meetings with a wide range of annotations, including abstactive summaries for each meeting and links from each sentence in the summary to the set of sentences in the original transcripts that sentence is summarizing.",
        "We use this information as our gold standard since it provides many examples in which a set of sentences in the meeting (a commu-nity) is linked to a human written sentence summarizing that community.",
        "141 In our experiments, we use human authored transcripts.",
        "Note that our approach is not specific to conversations, however it is designed to deal with ill-formed sentences and structural errors.",
        "Moreover, the first two components of our system are supervised, while the word graph model is completely unsupervised and domain independent.",
        "In order to train our logistic regression classifier for the first phase of our pipeline, we randomly select a training set that consists of 98 meetings.",
        "Note that there are about one million sentence pair instances in the training set since we consider every pairing of sentences within a meeting.",
        "The rest is selected as a test set for the evaluation phase.",
        "3.2 Experimental Settings For preprocessing our dataset we use OpenNLP3 for tokenization and part-of-speech tagging.",
        "When the number of sentences in each community is more than 10 (which happens in around 10% of the cases), the community is first clustered using the MajorClust (Stein and Niggemann, 1999) algorithm when sentences are represented as normalized tfidf vectors and the similarity between the sentences is measured using cosine similarity.",
        "Then, each cluster is treated as a separate community.",
        "The clustering guarantees a higher overlap between the sentences as well as a word graph with fewer paths.",
        "Next, we construct a word graph over each cluster and rank the valid paths.",
        "We choose the first ranked path as the abstractive summary of the cluster.",
        "For our language model, we use a tri-gram smoothed language model trained using the newswire text provided in the English Gigaword corpus (Graff and Cieri, ).",
        "3.3 Evaluation Metrics To evaluate performance, we use the ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 (unigram and bigram overlap) F1 score, which correlate well with human rankings of summary quality (Lin and Hovy, 2003).",

        "Furthermore, to evaluate the grammaticality of our generated summaries in comparison with the original word graph method, following common practice (Barzilay and McKeown, 2005), we randomly selected 10 meeting summaries (total 150 sentences).",

        "However, the ClusterRank and TextRank systems outperform our model for ROUGE-2 score.",
        "This can be due to word merging and word replacement choices in the word graph construction (see Section 2.3.1), which sometimes changes a word in a bigram and consequently decreases the bigram overlap score.",
        "A more detailed analysis of this problem is left as future work.",
        "Note that there is a drop in ROUGE score when we use entailment in our system in comparison with ablating the entailment phase (-ent).",
        "This is mainly due to the fact that the entailment phase filters equivalent sentences.",
        "This affects the results negatively when such filtered sentences share many common words with our human-authored abstracts.",
        "We believe that this drop is partly associated with our evaluation metric rather than meaning.",
        "In other words, we expect no difference in performance when a human evaluation is applied.",
        "However, the entailment phase helps in improving the efficiency of our pipeline significantly.",
        "If each graph has e edges, n nodes, and p paths, then finding all the paths results in time complexity O((np + 1)(e + n)), using depth-first search.",
        "Decreasing the number of sentences will reduce the number of nodes and edges, which leads to the smaller number of paths.",
        "This is even more significant when there are many sentences in a community in comparison with the gold standard.",
        "Note that it's impossible to finish the graph building phase after 12 hours on a 2.3 GHz quad-core machine without performing the entailment phase, when we use our community detection model.",
        "This would be especially problematic in a real-time setting.",
        "Comparing the gold standard sentence communities (GC) and our fully automatic system, we can notice that inaccuracies in the community detection phase affects the overall performance.",
        "How-ever, using our community detection model, we still outperform the previous models significantly.",
        "Table 2 shows grammaticality scores, distributions over the three scores and average sentence lengths in tokens.",
        "The results demonstrate that 47% of the sentences generated by our method are grammatically correct and 39% of the generated sentences are almost correct.",
        "In comparison with the original word graph method, our model reports slightly lower results for the grammaticality score and the percentage of correct sentences.",
        "How-ever, considering the correlation between sentence length and grammatical complexity, our model is capable of generating longer sentences with more information content (according to ROUGE) and competitive grammaticality scores.",
        "4 Discussion After analyzing the results and through manual verification of some cases, we observe that our approach produces some interestingly successful examples.",
        "Nevertheless, it appears that the performance is still far from satisfactory.",
        "This leaves an interesting challenge for the research community to tackle.",
        "We have identified five different sources of error: Type 1: Abstractive human-authored summaries: the nature of our method is based on extracting the relevant sentences and generating an abstract sentence by aggregating such sentences.",
        "Also due to this, our generated abstracts are often informal and closer to the transcripts'",
        "style.",
        "However, in many cases, the human-written summaries are composed by understanding the original sentences and produce a formal style abstract sentence, often using a different vocabulary and structure.",
        "For example: Human-authored: The industrial designer and user interface designer presented the prototype they created, which was designed to look like a banana.",
        "System: Working on the principle of a fruit it's basically designed around a banana.",
        "Type 2: Evaluation method: The current evaluation methods fail to capture the meaning and relies only on matching the words at uni-or bigram level.",
        "Therefore, we believe that a manual evaluation can reveal more potential of our system in generating abstractive summaries that are closer to human-written summaries.",
        "143 Human-authored: the project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting.",
        "System: I told you guys about the three new requirements ... so that was the last meeting.",
        "Type 3: Subjective abstractive summaries: often it is not easy for humans to agree on one summary for a meeting.",
        "It is well known that inter-annotator agreement is quite low for the summarization task (Mani, 2001).",
        "For example: Human-authored 1: They do tool training with a whiteboard and each person introduces themselves and draws their favorite animal on the board.",
        "Human-authored 2: The group introduced themselves to each other and acquainted themselves with the meeting-room materials by drawing on the whiteboard.",
        "System: We are gonna know each other and then draw your little animal.",
        "Type 4: Speaker information: since the nature of our method is based on extracting the relevant sentences or speaker utterances, we do not take the speaker information into consideration.",
        "However, the human-written summaries for meetings take the speaker into account.",
        "We plan to extend our framework to include this feature.",
        "For example: Human-authored: The project manager opened the meeting and stated the agenda to the team members.",
        "System: I hope you're ready for this functional design meeting know at the end projects requirement.",
        "Type 5: Transcription errors: as mentioned be-fore, the meeting transcripts often contain struc-ture, grammar, vocabulary choice and dictation errors.",
        "This always raises more challenges for algorithms dealing with such texts.",
        "For example: Transcript: if it i if it isn't more expensive for us to k make because as far as I understand it.",
        "In light of this analysis, we conclude that a more comprehensive evaluation method (e.g., human evaluation), including speaker information in the pipeline and using text normalization techniques to reduce the effects of noisy transcripts can better reveal the potential of our system in dealing with meeting summarization.",
        "5 Conclusion and Future Work In this paper, we study the problem of abstractive meeting summarization, and propose a novel framework to generate summaries composed of grammatical sentences.",
        "Within this framework, this paper makes three main contributions.",
        "First, in contrast with most current methods based on fully extractive models, we propose to take advantage of a word graph model for sentence fusion to generate abstractive summary sentences.",
        "Sec-ond, beyond most of the current approaches which disregard semantic information, we integrate semantics by means of building textual entailment graphs over sentence communities.",
        "Third, our framework uses minimal syntactic information in comparison with previous methods and does not require a domain specific, engineered conventional NLP component.",
        "We successfully applied our framework over a challenging meeting dataset, the AMI corpus.",
        "Some significant improvements over our dataset, in comparison with previous methods, demonstrates the potential of our approach in dealing with meeting summarization.",
        "Moreover, we prove that our model can generate longer sentences with only a minimal loss in grammaticality.",
        "In light of the results of our preliminary formative evaluation, future work will address the improvement of the community detection and sentence fusion phases.",
        "On the one hand, we plan to improve our community detection graph by adding more relevant features into our current supervised model.",
        "On the other hand, we plan to incorporate a better source of lexical knowledge in the word graph construction (e.g., YAGO or DBpedia).",
        "We are also interested in improving our ranking model by assigning tuned weights to each component.",
        "In addition, we are exploring the replacement of pronouns by their referents (e.g., replacing 'I'",
        "by the name or role of the speaker) to improve both the entailment and word graph models.",
        "Once we will have explored all these improvements, we plan to run more comprehensive human evaluations.",
