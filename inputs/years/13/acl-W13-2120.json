        "We present the results from an elicitation experiment in which human speakers were asked to produced quantified referring expressions (QREs), as in ?The crate with 10 apples?, ?The crate with many apples?, etc.",
        "These results suggest that some subtle contextual factors govern the choice between different types of QREs, and that numerals are highly preferred for subitiz-able quantities despite the availability of coarser-grained expressions."

        "Speakers can express quantities in different ways.",
        "For instance, a speaker may specify a meeting time with the expression ?in the morning?",
        "or with the more precise, numeric expression ?at 10:30am??",
        "; she may choose to specify a temperature as ?5 degrees Celsius?",
        "or instead use the less precise but more qualifying expression ?cold?.",
        "One area of NLG where these choices are important is the generation of referring expressions.",
        "In particular, a referent may be identified by means of some quantitative value or other (e.g., ?the tall man; ?the man who is 198cm tall?",
        "), or by means of the number of other entities to which it is related.",
        "Henceforth, let's call these quantified referring expressions (QREs).",
        "An example of a QRE arises, for instance, when a person is identified by means of the number of his children (?the man with 5 daughters?",
        "), when a directory is identified by means of the number of files in it (?the directory with 520/many PDF files in it?",
        "), or when a crate is identified by means of the number of apples in it (?the crate with 7 /a few apples?).",
        "Green and van Deemter (2011) asked under what circumstances it might be beneficial, for a reader or hearer, for referring expressions of this kind to contain vague expressions (e.g., like many).",
        "The present paper addresses the same phenomena focussing, more broadly, on all the different ways in which reference may be achieved; unlike these previous authors, we shall address this question from the point of view of the speaker, asking how human speakers refer in such cases, rather than how useful a given referring expression is to a hearer (e.g., as measured by their response times in a manipulation task).",
        "We start by making our research questions more precise in the next section.",
        "We then describe the production experiment we run online in Section 3 and present an analysis of the data in Section 4.",
        "We end with some pointers on how our results could inform an NLG module for QREs."

        "Suppose you want to point out one crate amongst several crates with different numbers of apples.",
        "You may use a numeral (?the crate with seven apples?)",
        "or, if the crate in question is the one with the largest or smallest amount of apples, you may use superlatives (?the crate with the most apples?",
        "), comparatives (?with more apples?)",
        "or vague quantifiers (?with many apples?",
        "); if your crate is the only one with any apples in it at all, you might simply say ?the crate with apples?).",
        "In many situations, several of these options are applicable.",
        "It is not obvious, however, which of these is preferred.",
        "The Gricean Maxim of Quantity (Grice, 1975) urges speakers to make their contribution as informative as, but not more informative than, it is required for the current purposes of the exchange.",
        "This might be taken to predict that speakers will tend to use the most coarsely grained expression that identifies the referent (unless they want some nontrivial implicatures to be inferred).",
        "This would predict, for example that it is odd to say ?the box with 27 apples?",
        "when ?the box with apples?",
        "suffices, because the latter contains a boolean property (contains apples), whereas the former relies",
        "on a special case on what is essentially much more finely grained property (contains x apples).",
        "Our hunch, however, was that this is not the whole story.",
        "For example, the literature on human number processing suggests that numbers below 5 or 6 are handled almost effortlessly; these numbers are called subitizable (Kaufman et al., 1949) Furthermore, we hypothesized that it matters to what extent the number of apples in the target crate ?stands out?.",
        "We had the following expectations:",
        "1.",
        "Speakers do not always use the coarsest-grained level that is sufficient.",

        "choice.",
        "3.",
        "The frequency of vague forms (such as ?many?)",
        "will be higher in contexts where the gap between the target quantity and the quantities in the distractors is large than when it is small.1 We wanted to put these ideas to the test and, more generally, find out how human speakers use QREs in different contexts.",
        "Our interest was also in creating a corpus of human-produced QREs that can serve future research."

        "This main effect of subitizability was significant (?2(1) = 47.92, p < .001).",
        "There was high variability across subjects in the effect (?2(1) = 25.00, p < .001), with a higher rate of numerical expressions associated with a smaller effect of subitizability (r = ?.61).",
        "Note that 17 of the 82 subjects (?",
        "20%) always used numerical expressions, even when the target was not subitizable.",

        "For subitizable targets (Figure 2, bottom row), numeric expressions were almost always used (96%) except in contexts where the target was the only filled square (X ).",
        "In this context, participants occasionally used absolute expressions instead (e.g. the one with shapes) 33% of the time.",

        "For non-subitizable targets (first row of plots in Figure 2), in contexts without distractors (X ) absolute expressions were preferred over numerical ones; this differed from the behaviour of subitizable targets in this context, where numerical expressions predominated (?2(1) = 4.25, p = .039).",

        "The comparison between the contexts with two distractors (XYY and XYZ) suggests that they differed largely in the use of vague expressions (BASE; e.g. the one with many diamonds), which had a higher rate in context XYY where there were only two quantity ranges (?2(1) = 5.01, 2Category OTH (other) is not shown in Figure 2 to avoid clutter.",

        "In line with our expectations (see Section 2), our data are not easy to reconcile with the type of Gricean account that predicts a preference for the most coarsely grained QRE that identifies the target.",
        "The most obvious deviation from this Gricean account arises from the subitizable items in our study, where numerical expressions turned out to be much preferred over other QREs.",
        "The natural explanation seems to be that such expressions come naturally to speakers (and to hearers too as shown by Green and van Deemter (2011)).",
        "In other words, our study suggests an intriguing variant on Grice, in which the most relevant factor is not one of informativeness ?",
        "as Grice's writings suggest ?",
        "but one of effort.",
        "It suggests that speakers tend to produce expressions that identify the referent with least effort.",
        "Our expectation 3 was also confirmed: vague forms (BASE) are more frequent with big gap sizes, although they are not produced with high frequency.",
        "(The same pattern of results was found by van Deemter (2004)).",
        "Thus, in the scenarios we considered vague QREs are never the most favoured option.",
        "The high frequency of superlatives over comparatives is also noteworthy.",
        "Comparatives are used very seldom overall but are more frequent in contexts with only one distractor (XY ).",
        "This indicates that some speakers opt for a less strong expression than a superlative (an expression that means more than x rather than more than any other x) in contexts where this does not lead to ambiguity.",
        "However, numerals and superlatives are still largely preferred in those contexts.",
        "These observations suggest that a given type of situation (i.e., a given context + subitizability condition) should not always map to the same type of QRE.",
        "If human QRE behaviour is to be mimicked, the best approach seems to be to use a stochastic NLG program that seeks to replicate the frequencies that are found in human usage.",
