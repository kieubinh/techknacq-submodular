        "My focus is the generation of textual descriptions for n-dimensional data.",
        "At this early stage in this research, I introduce the problem, describe a potential application and source of interesting n-dimensional objects and show preliminary work on a traditional NLG system built on off-the-shelf text planning and surface realization technology plus a customized sentence planner.",
        "This work was inspired by a talk by Kathleen McCoy in which she described a system that produces Natural Language explanations of magazine infographics for the blind by combining Computer Vision techniques with NLG (Carberry et al., 2013).",
        "She mentioned an anecdote in which she asked a blind user of the system what would the user would want added to the text description and the user replied ?I don't know, I have never seen an infographic.?",
        "I found the comment very inspiring and it led to the realization that n-dimensional objects (for n > 3) were also something which we, as humans, have never seen before and which we will profit from having a computer system to describe to us.",
        "A type of n-dimensional objects that are of particular practical interest are the error function for a machine learning algorithm for particular training data.",
        "That is the case because, for NLP practitioners using supervised classification, the task of debugging and improving their classifiers at times involves repeated steps of training with different parameters.",
        "Usually, at each stage the trained model is kept as an opaque construct of which only aggregate statistics (precision, recall, etc) are investigated.",
        "My technology improves this scenario by generating Natural Language descriptions for the error function of trained machine learning models.",
        "My system, Thoughtland,1 (Fig.",
        "1) is a pipeline with four stages, accessed through a Web-based interface (Duboue, 2013), further discussed in the next section.",
        "This early prototype is already able to tackle descriptions of existing, non-trivial data.",
        "These results are very encouraging and the problem merits attention from other NLG researchers.",
        "To further broad interest in this problem, I am distributing my prototype under a Free Software license,2 which should encourage extensions and classroom use.",
        "I have already found the current descriptions useful for telling apart the output of two different algorithms when run on the same data.",
        "I will now describe the algorithm and then dive into the NLG details.",
        "I conclude with related and future work discussions."

        "While the first stage lies clearly outside the interest of NLG practitioners, the next two stages (Clustering and Analysis) are related to the message generation aspect of content planning (Reiter and Dale, 2000),3 as they seek to transform the data into units that can be communicated verbally (the last stage is the more traditional NLG system itself)."

        "These representations are important later on for the natural language generation approach.",
        "Some input features present a natural geometric groupings which will interfere with a clustering set to elucidate the error function.",

        "The distance between two n-balls, for example, is said to be big if in any dimension",

        "I use two schemata, in one the n-balls are presented in order while in the other the attributes are presented in order.",
        "One of the schemata I am using is shown in Fig. 2.",
        "Document structuring schemata are transition networks of rhetorical predicates that can contain free and bound variables, with restrictions on each variable.",
        "The system presents the user the shorter description.",
        "Either strategy should emphasize similarities, simplifying aggregation (Reape and Mellish, 1999).",
        "I employ some basic aggregation rules, that",
        "is, for each aggregation segment I assemble all n-balls with the same property together to make complex sentences.",
        "That works well for size and density.",
        "To verbalize distances, I group the different pairs by distance value and then look for cliques using the Bron-Kerbosch clique-finding algorithm (Bron and Kerbosch, 1973), as implemented in JGraphT.7 I also determine the most common distance and verbalize it as a defeasible rule (Knott et al., 1997), which significantly shortens the text.",

        "In the more general topic of explaining machine learning decisions, ExOpaque (Guo and Selman, 2007) takes a trained system and uses it to produce training data for an Inductive Logic Programming (Muggleton and Raedt., 1994) system, presenting the resulting Horn-clauses directly to the user.",
        "Focusing on explaining the impact of specific attributes in the prediction outcome of a particular instance, Robnik-Sikonja and Kononenko (2008) analyze changes to the classification outcome under different input variations, weighted by their priors, an idea explored early on in agent-based systems (Johnson, 1994).",
