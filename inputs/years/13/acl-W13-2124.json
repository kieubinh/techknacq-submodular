        "We introduce GenNext, an NLG system designed specifically to adapt quickly and easily to different domains.",
        "Given a domain corpus of historical texts, GenNext allows the user to generate a template bank organized by semantic concept via derived discourse representation structures in conjunction with general and domain-specific entity tags.",
        "Based on various features collected from the training corpus, the system statistically learns template representations and document structure and produces well?formed texts (as evaluated by crowdsourced and expert evaluations).",
        "In addition to domain adaptation, Gen-Next's hybrid approach significantly reduces complexity as compared to traditional NLG systems by relying on templates (consolidating micro-planning and surface realization) and minimizing the need for domain experts.",
        "In this description, we provide details of GenNext's theoretical perspective, architecture and evaluations of output."

        "NLG systems are typically tailored to very specific domains and tasks such as text summaries from neonatal intensive care units (SUMTIME-NEONATE (Portet et al., 2007)) or offshore oil rig weather reports (SUMTIME-METEO (Reiter et al., 2005)) and require significant investments in development resources (e.g. people, time, etc.).",
        "For example, for SUMTIME-METEO, 12 person months were required for two of the system components alone (Belz, 2007).",
        "Given the subject matter of such systems, the investment is perfectly ?Ravi Kondadadi is now affiliated with Nuance Communications, Inc. reasonable.",
        "However, if the domains to be generated are comparatively more general, such as financial reports or biographies, then the scaling of development costs becomes a concern in NLG.",
        "NLG in the editorial process for companies and institutions where content can vary must be domain adaptable.",
        "Spending a year or more of development time to produce high quality market summaries, for example, is not a viable solution if it is necessary to start from scratch to produce other reports.",
        "GenNext, a hybrid system that statistically learns document and sentence template representations from existing historical data, is developed to be consolidated and domain adaptable.",
        "In particular, GenNext reduces complexity by avoiding the necessity of having a separate document planner, surface realizer, etc., and extensive expert involvement at the outset of system development.",

      "text": [
        "In general, NLG systems follow a prototypical architecture where some input data from a given domain is sent to a ?document planner?",
        "which decides content and structuring to create a document plan.",
        "That document plan serves as an input to a ?micro planner?",
        "where the content is converted into a syntactic expression (with associated considerations of aggregation and referring expression generation) and a text specification is created.",
        "The text specification then goes through the final stage of ?surface realization?",
        "where everything is put together into an output text (McKeown, 1985; Reiter and Dale, 2000; Bateman and Zock, 2003).",
        "In contrast, the architecture of GenNext (summarized in Figure 1) is driven by a domain-specific",
        "corpus text.",
        "There is often a structured database underlying the domains of corpus text, the fields of which are used for domain specific entity tagging (in addition to domain general entity tagging [e.g.",
        "DATE, LOCATION, etc.]).",
        "An overview of the different stages, which are a combination of statistical (e.g., Langkilde and Knight (1998)) and template?based (e.g., van Deemter, et al. (2005)) approaches, follows in (A-E).1 A: Semantic Representation - We take a domain specific training corpus and reduce each sentence to a Discourse Representation Structure (DRS) - formal semantic representations of sentences (and texts) from Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp and Reyle, 1993; Basile and Bos, 2011).",
        "Each DRS is a combination of domain general named entities, predicates (content words) and relational elements (function words).",
        "In parallel, domain specific named entity tags are identified and are used to create templates that syntactically",
        "represent some conceptual meaning; for example, the short biography in (1): (1) Sentence a. Mr. Mitsutaka Kambe has been serving as Managing Director of the 77 Bank, Ltd. since June 27, 2008. b.",
        "He holds a Bachelor's in finance from USC and a MBA from UCLA.",
        "Conceptual Meaning c. SERVING |MANAGING |DIRECTOR |PERSON |... d. HOLDS |BACHELOR |FINANCE |MBA |HOLD |...",
        "Once the semantic representations are created, they are organized and identified by semantic concept (?CuId?)",
        "(described in (B)).",
        "Our assumption is that each cluster equates with a CuId represented by each individual sentence in the cluster and is contrastive with other CuIds (for similar ap-1For more detail see Howald, et al.

        "proaches, see Barzilay and Lapata (2005), Angeli, et al. (2010) and Lu and Ng (2011)).",
        "B: Creating Conceptual Units - To create the CuIds (a semi-automatic process), we cluster the sentences using k-means clustering with k set arbitrarily high to over-generate (Witten and Frank, 2005).",
        "This facilitates manual verification of the generated clusters to merge (rather than split) them if necessary.",
        "We assign a unique CuId to each cluster and associate each template in the corpus to a corresponding CuId.",
        "For example, in (2), using the sentences in (1a-b), the identified named entities are assigned to a clustered CuId (2a-b) and then each sentence in the training corpus is re",

        "Frequency distribution of entity sequence ?",
        "Average number of entities by CuId and position",
        "These statistics, in addition to entity tags and templates, are used in building different features used by the ranking model (D).",
        "D: Building a Ranking Model - The core component of our system is a statistical model that ranks a set of templates for a given position (e.g. sentence 1, sentence 2, ..., sentence n) based on the input data (see also Konstas and Lapata (2012).",
        "The learning task is to find the rank for all the templates from all CuIds at each position.",

        "We have tested GenNext on three domains: Corporate Officer and Director Biographies (1150 texts ranging from 3-10 period ended sentences), Financial Texts (Mutual Fund Performances [162 texts, 2-4 sentences] and Broker Recommendations [905 texts, 8-20 sentences]), and Offshore Oil Rig Weather Reports (1054 texts, 2-6 sentences) from SUMTIME-METEO (Reiter et al., 2005).",
        "The total number of templates for the financial domain is 1379 distributed across 38 different semantic concepts; 2836 templates across 19 concepts for biography; and 2749 templates across 9 concepts for weather texts.",
        "We have conducted several evaluation experiments comparing two versions of GenNext, one applying the ranking model (rank) and one with random selection of templates (non-rank) (both systems use the same template bank, CuId assignment and filtering) and the original texts from which the data was extracted (original).",
        "We used a combination of automatic (e.g. BLEU?4 (Papineni et al., 2002), METEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2011)) and human metrics (using crowdsourcing) to evaluate the output (see generally, Belz and Reiter (2006).",
        "However, in the interest of space, we will restrict the discussion to a human judgment task on output preferences.",
        "We found this evaluation task to be most informative for system improvement.",
        "The task asks an evaluator to provide a binary preference determination (100 sentence pairs/domain): ?Do you prefer Sentence A (from original) or the corresponding Sentence B (from rank or non-rank)?.",
        "This task was performed for each domain.2 We also engaged 3 experts from the financial and 4 from the biography domains to perform the same preference task (average agreement was 76.22) as well as provide targeted feedback.",
        "For the preference results, summarized in Figure 2, we would like to see no statistically significant difference between GenNext-rank and original, but statistically significant differences be",
        "tween GenNext-rank and GenNext-non-rank, and original and GenNext-non-rank.",
        "If this is the case, then GenNext-rank is producing texts similar to the original texts, and is providing an observable improvement over not including the model at all (GenNext-non-rank).",

        "The original financial documents were machine generated from a different existing system.",
        "As such, it is not surprising to see similarity in performance compared to GenNext-rank and potentially explains why preferences for the originals is somewhat low (assuming a higher preference rating for well-formed human texts).",
        "Further, the original weather documents are highly technical and not easily understood by the lay person, so, again, it is not surprising to see similar performance.",

        "For example, shorter texts were preferred to longer texts in the financial domain, but not the biographies.",
        "Consequently, we could adjust weights to favor shorter templates.",
        "Also, in biographies, sentences with subordinated elaborations were not preferred because these contained subjective comments (e.g. a leader in industry, a well respected individual, etc.).",

        "We have presented our system GenNext which is domain adaptable, given adequate historical data, and has a significantly reduced complexity compared to other NLG systems (see generally, Robin and McKeown (1996)).",
        "To the latter point, development time for semantically processing the corpus, applying domain general and specific tags, and building a model is accomplished in days and weeks as opposed to months and years.",
        "Future experimentation will focus on being able to automatically extract templates for different domains to create preset banks of templates in the absence of adequate historical data.",
        "We are also looking into different ways to increase the variability of output texts from selecting templates within a range of top scores (rather than just the highest score) to providing additional generated information from input data analytics."
