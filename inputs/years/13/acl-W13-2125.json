      "heading": "3.1 General characteristics Features: SimpleNLG uses a system of features for various functions: encoding morphological and syntactic properties of lexical units; letting the user set the parameters of a particular phrase (plural, verb tenses, etc.); and internally keeping track of the content of a phrase and various information needed during realisation. This system is generic enough to be used for other languages. Most features are reusable and others can be added as needed. In SimpleNLG-EnFr, most of the already present features were reused for French. Lexicon: In SimpleNLG, the lexicon is already relatively well separated from the grammar. The basic lexicon class provides an interface to a simple XML file containing the necessary information about the lexical units. The list of available fields in this file can easily be extended by adding lexical features to the ones used for English. In SimpleNLG-EnFr, many lexical features were added mainly to account for the higher complexity of French morphology. 3.2 Syntax Verb phrase and clause: First, English and French have the same basic clause constituent order: Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). Even more importantly for SimpleNLG-EnFr, this constituent order is relatively stable (compared with other languages like German or Russian), at least for the purpose of practical NLG applications. This frees us in most cases from having to choose between different syntactically correct word orders. We thus did not have to make such big changes to the syntactic representation as were needed in adapting SimpleNLG to German (Bollmann, 2011). Indeed, in German the subject has the same syntactic status in the clause than the ob-ject(s) and they can all occupy the same varying positions relative to the verb. However, Boll-mann (2011) had more leeway because he had decided not to keep the English grammar alongside the German one in his implementation. In contrast, in SimpleNLG-EnFr we wanted to be able to change freely between English and French grammars during the generation of a single text. English and French also have a very similar passive construction. In French, it is used less frequently because other options exist to avoid mentioning the subject of a sentence (for exam-ple, using the indefinite personal pronoun on),",
      "text": [
        "but choosing between those constructions is not the role of the realisation engine.",
        "Noun phrase: English and French can both have a determiner at the beginning of a noun phrase.",
        "Prepositional phrase: Both languages use prepositions (not postpositions) for introducing various complements.",
        "Coordinated phrase: Both have a coordination conjunction in penultimate position and both use commas as separators between coordinates.",
        "3.3 Morphology In both languages, nouns and verbs are marked morphologically for singular/plural.",
        "In addition, personal pronoun forms differ based not only on number and person, but also on grammatical function and gender.",
        "This last similarity facilitated adapting pronominalisation.",
        "4 Adaptations for French The rules for each processing level are encoded in separate modules for each language.",
        "The following adaptations were made for French by adding syntactic and lexical features and encoding the corresponding rules in the French versions of the grammar rules modules.",
        "4.1 Syntax Verb phrase and clause: French negation has some similarities but also big differences with its English counterpart.",
        "It is usually expressed with not one but two adverbs (ne and pas), which come respectively before and after the first word of the verb group, as in example (1).",
        "Moreover, pas can be replaced by other negation auxiliaries to specify a different kind of negation, as in (2).",
        "Finally, no negation auxiliary is used (only ne) when the sentence already carries another negative element, for example a negative indefinite pronoun as in (3).",
        "(1) il ne parle pas ?he does not speak?",
        "(2) il ne parle plus he not speaks more ?he does not speak anymore?",
        "(3) personne ne parle nobody not speaks ?nobody speaks?",
        "In French, some complement pronouns, instead of being placed after the verb as in the regular SVO word order, are placed just before it.",
        "Furthermore, some of them sometimes take in that case a different form.",
        "The rules governing",
        "the acceptable combinations and sequencings of those complements that can be cliticised in this way are very precise.",
        "Examples (4) and (5) illustrate this phenomenon.",
        "(4) il la leur r?f?re he her them refers ?he refers her to them?",
        "(5) il nous r?f?re ?",
        "eux he us refers to them ?he refers us to them?",
        "The complexity of French past participle agreement is well known, particularly because it manifests itself mostly in written French.",
        "French verbs can have ?tre (to be) or avoir (to have) as auxiliaries in compound tenses.",
        "This influences whether the past participle agrees with the subject (?tre) or the direct object if it is placed before the past participle (avoir).",
        "Combined with clitic complement pronouns and relative clauses, among others, it can get very complex.",
        "In addi-tion, French past participles are inflected in gender and number, like adjectives.",
        "Noun phrase: In SimpleNLG, a noun phrase can have pre-modifiers and post-modifiers.",
        "Ad-jectives are by default considered pre-modifiers and everything else post-modifiers.",
        "In contrast, in French, most adjectives are placed after the noun, but some (the most common) are most frequently placed before the noun.",
        "In SimpleNLG-EnFr this is achieved by referring to an extra lexical feature.",
        "In addition, in French the determiner and adjectives agree with the noun in number and gen-der.",
        "Instead of adding a new mechanism to propagate relevant features of the noun phrase to where they are needed, as with subject-verb agreement in SimpleNLG, the solution implemented was to let the determiner and adjectives get themselves the information they needed from their parent constituent.",
        "This more flexible way of managing agreement is more amenable to multilingual realisation.",
        "Interrogative clause: A simple way of building an interrogative sentence in French is to pre-pend the expression est-ce que (is it that), like in (6).",
        "This is what we chose.",
        "(6) est-ce que tu as mang??",
        "is it that you have eaten?",
        "?did you eat??",
        "This kind of interrogative clause can be built in part by using the relative clause rules (see be-low).",
        "Relative clause: A mechanism for building relative clauses has been added to the French part of SimpleNLG-EnFr that has no direct equivalent in the English implementation.",
        "The phrase that must be replaced by a relative pronoun is specified by setting a feature on the clause.",
        "This phrase will not appear in the realised clause.",
        "Even if this phrase was not present in the clause, it will still be used to choose a relative pronoun, which can be useful.",
        "The grammatical function of that phrase can in that case be set manually.",
        "The resulting relative pronoun takes the place that is normally reserved for the complementiser.",
        "Its form is chosen according to two sources: the grammatical function and preposition, if any, of the phrase it replaces; and the person and gender of its antecedent (the noun or pronoun that the relative clause modifies).",
        "Examples (7), (8) and (9) illustrate this.",
        "(7) la tarte que tu as mang?e the pie that.obj you have eaten.fem ?the pie that you ate?",
        "(8) la tarte qui a ?t?",
        "mang?e the pie that.subj has been eaten.fem ?the pie that was eaten?",
        "(9) l?homme dont j?ai mang?",
        "la tarte the man whose I have eaten the pie ?the man whose pie I ate?",
        "4.2 Morphology Number and gender: French determiners and adjectives must be inflected in number and gen-der.",
        "Additionally, number and gender interact with each other in the inflection process.",
        "Verb tenses: Verb inflected forms are more varied in French than in English.",
        "In addition, French verbs are classified in three conjugation groups.",
        "The first group is comprised of the regular verbs.",
        "The third group is a catchall category for miscellaneous irregular verbs.",
        "Several morphological rules govern the combination of the verb inflection morphemes.",
        "Detached form of personal pronouns: In French, personal pronouns are often cliticised (see subsection 5.1), but where they are not, they take a different form, which is called forme dis-jointe (detached form).",
        "See leur versus eux in examples (4) and (5).",
        "4.3 Morphophonology The morphophonological level is a new processing level introduced in SimpleNLG-EnFr to account for a range of phenomena very common in French and other languages.",
        "They are best described using rules that use both morphological and phonological conditions.",
        "The only obvious example of this kind of rule in written English, which was included in the morphology module",
        "in SimpleNLG, is illustrated by examples (10) and (11).",
        "(10) a + book ?",
        "a book (11) a + apple ?",
        "an apple Here the morphological condition is the presence of the indefinite singular determiner a and the phonological one is the presence of a vowel at the beginning of the next word.",
        "The morphology rules operate on one word at a time.",
        "The morphophonology rules may need to have access to adjacent words and to be applied after all inflection and derivation rules have been applied.",
        "This justifies a separate processing level.",
        "In SimpleNLG-EnFr, the morphophonological level is used mainly for external sandhi, i.e. phenomena occurring at word boundaries.",
        "Elision: In French some words have their last vowel elided when in front of a word beginning by a vowel or a so-called h aspir?",
        "(aspired h).",
        "Indeed, an extra lexical feature is needed for French words beginning with the letter h to know if that kind of rule applies.",
        "Note that the letter h itself is never pronounced in French.",
        "Examples (12) and (13) illustrate elision, while it does not occur in (14).",
        "(12) la + amiti?",
        "?",
        "l?amiti?",
        "the friendship (13) le + homme ?",
        "l?homme the man (14) la + honte ?",
        "la honte the shame Liaison: Liaison is a phenomenon akin to eli-sion, except that it involves adding and/or replacing phonemes.",
        "Its ?goal?",
        "is to avoid contact between the vowel at the end of some words and the beginning vowel of the next word.",
        "It is mostly apparent in speech, although it sometimes has an effect in written French, as in (15).",
        "(15) le + beau + homme ?",
        "le bel homme the handsome man Prepositions: Some prepositions interact with definite determiners in French, as in (16).",
        "(16) ?",
        "+ le ?",
        "au at the 5 Bilingual generation Building a bilingual realisation engine rather than just adapting SimpleNLG for unilingual French realisation was a design choice dictated mainly by practical considerations.",
        "Being able to use the same realisation engine (and thus the same API) for several or all target languages when developing a multilingual NLG application is convenient.",
        "In the case of English and French, this could be most useful when targeting Canadian or European populations, for example.",
        "In SimpleNLG-EnFr, bilingual generation is implemented by being able to determine dynamically the language of each processing unit: phrases for the syntax module, lexical units for the morphology module, etc.",
        "The factories used by the library's user to create syntactic structure specifications and access or create lexical units each use a language-specific lexicon.",
        "Each processing module then chooses at realisation time which set of rules to apply to a given processing unit based on the language of its lexicon.",
        "Thus, sentences, phrases and words of different languages can be mixed freely.",
        "6 Conclusion A bilingual realisation engine for English and French was built.",
        "It took five months to com-plete, including the writing of a detailed French manual.",
        "Despite many internal changes, it retains almost the same API as the original.",
        "Future improvements could include enlarging the default lexicon and adding specialised lexicons for French, implementing a complete textual representation for numbers, and adapting the changes in SimpleNLG since version 4.2, like the XML realiser.",
        "More languages could be added to Sim-pleNLG-EnFr.",
        "However, it would perhaps be easier to include many languages if the grammar of each language could be specified in a common grammar formalism, instead of programmatically in the processing modules themselves.",
        "This would necessitate changing the architecture.",
        "In the process of developing SimpleNLG-EnFr, a great deal was learned about what kind of challenges multilingual realisation poses.",
        "A common grammatical ground must be found and exploited for the group of languages considered, which should not be too far apart in that respect.",
        "For the rest, care must be taken not to make too many assumptions about the inner workings of the grammar of each language.",
        "Indeed, every language has its own grammatical peculiarities.",
        "Acknowledgments We would like to thank the SimpleNLG team for having made available its source code.",
