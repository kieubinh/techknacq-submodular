        "Monitoring of physiological data using body area networks (BAN) is becoming increasingly popular as advances in sensor and wireless technology enable lightweight and low costs devices to be easily deployed.",
        "This gives rise to applications in home health monitoring and may be useful to promote greater awareness of health and prevention for particular end user groups such as the elderly (Ahmed et al., 2013).",
        "A challenge however, is the large volumes of data which is produced as a result of wearable sensors.",
        "Furthermore, the data has a number of characteristics which currently make automatic methods of data analysis particularly difficult.",
        "Such characteristics include the multivariate nature of the data where several dependent variables are captured as well as the frequency of measurements for which we still lack a general understanding of how particular physiological parameters vary when measured continuously.",
        "Recently many systems of health monitoring sensors have been introduced which are designed to perform massive and profound analysis in the area of smart health monitoring systems (Baig and Gholamhosseini, 2013).",
        "Also several research have been done to show the applications and efficiency of data mining approaches in healthcare fields (Yoo et al., 2012).",
        "Such progress in the field would be suitable to combine with state of the art in the NLG community.",
        "Examples of suitable NLG systems include the system proposed by Reiter and Dale (2000) which suggested an architecture to detect and summarise happenings in the input data, recognise the significance of information and its compatibility to the user, and generate a text which shows this knowledge in an understandable way.",
        "A specific instantiation of this system on clinical data is BabyTalk project, which is generated summaries of the patient records in various time scales for different end users (Portet et al., 2009; Hunter et al., 2012).",
        "While these works have made significant progress in the field, this paper will outline some remaining challenges that have yet to be addressed for physiological data monitoring which are discussed in this work.",
        "The paper will also present a first version of an NLG system that has been used to produce summaries of data collected with a body area network."

        "One of the main challenges in healthcare area is how to analyse physiological data such that valuable information can help the end user.",
        "To have a meaningful analysis of input signals, preprocessing the data is clearly an important step.",
        "This is especially true for wearable sensors where the signals can be noisy and contain artifacts in the recorded data.",
        "Another key challenge in physiological data monitoring is mapping from the many data analysis approaches to NLG.",
        "For example finding hidden layers of information with unsuper",
        "vised mining methods will be enable the system to make a representation of data which is not producible by human analysis alone.",
        "However, domain rules and expert knowledge are important in order to consider a priori information in the data analysis.",
        "Further external variables (such as medication, food, stress) may also be considered in a supervised analysis of the data.",
        "Therefore, there is a challenge to balance between data driven techniques that are able to find intrinsic patterns in the data and knowledge driven techniques which take into account contextual information."
