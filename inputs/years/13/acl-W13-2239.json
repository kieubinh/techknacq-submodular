        "If the systems are not distinct enough, they will bring very little value during system combination.",
        "However, if some of the systems produce diverse translations but achieve lower overall translation quality, their contributions risk being ignored during system combination.",
        "Prior work has approached the need for diverse systems by using different system architectures, model components, system build parameters, decoder hyperparameters, as well as data selection and weighting (Macherey and Och, 2007; DeNero et al., 2010; Xiao et al., 2013).",
        "However, during tuning, each individual system is still just trained to maximize its own isolated performance on a tune set, or at best an error-driven reweighting of the tune set, without explicitly taking into account the diversity of the resulting translations.",
        "Such tuning does not encourage systems to rigorously explore model variations that achieve both good translation quality and diversity with respect to the other systems.",
        "It is reasonable to suspect that this results in individual systems that under exploit the amount of diversity possible, given the characteristics of the individual systems.",
        "For better system combination, we propose building individual systems to attempt to simultaneously maximize the overall quality of the individual systems and the amount of diversity across systems.",
        "We operationalize this problem formulation by devising a new heuristic measure called Positive Diversity that estimates the potential usefulness of individual systems during system combination.",

        "In practice, either optimizing correctness directly or optimizing a surrogate objective that uses correctness to choose optimization targets results in roughly equivalent translation performance (Cherry and Foster, 2012).",
        "Even when individual systems are being built to be used in a larger combined system, they are still usually tuned to maximize their isolated individual system performance rather than to maximize the potential usefulness of their contribution during system combination.1 To our knowledge, no effort has been made to explicitly tune toward criteria that attempts to simultaneously maximize the translation quality of individual systems and their mutual diversity.",
