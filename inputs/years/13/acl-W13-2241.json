        "Our submissions use the framework of Gaussian Processes to investigate lightweight approaches for this problem.",
        "We focus on two approaches, one based on feature selection and another based on active learning.",
        "Using only 25 (out of 160) features, our model resulting from feature selection ranked 1st place in the scoring variant of subtask 1.1 and 3rd place in the ranking variant of the subtask, while the active learning model reached 2nd place in the scoring variant using only ?25% of the available instances for training.",
        "These results give evidence that Gaussian Processes achieve the state of the art performance as a modelling approach for translation quality estimation, and that carefully selecting features and instances for the problem can further improve or at least maintain the same performance levels while making the problem less resource-intensive."

        "The purpose of machine translation (MT) quality estimation (QE) is to provide a quality prediction for new, unseen machine translated texts, without relying on reference translations (Blatz et al., 2004; Specia et al., 2009; Callison-burch et al., 2012).",
        "A common use of quality predictions is the decision between post-editing a given machine translated sentence and translating its source from scratch, based on whether its post-editing effort is estimated to be lower than the effort of translating the source sentence.",

        "We explore the application of GP models in two contexts: 1) improving the prediction performance by applying a feature selection step based on optimised hyperparameters and 2) reducing the dataset size (and therefore the annotation effort) by performing Active Learning (AL).",
        "We submitted entries for two of the four proposed tasks.",
        "Task 1.1 focused on predicting HTER scores (Human Translation Error Rate) (Snover et al., 2006) using a dataset composed of 2254 English-Spanish news sentences translated by Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) and post-edited by a professional translator.",
        "The evaluation used a blind test set, measuring MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), in the case of the scoring variant, and DeltaAvg and Spearman's rank correlation in the case of the ranking variant.",
        "Our submissions reached 1st (feature selection) and 2nd (active learning) places in the scoring variant, the task the models were optimised for, and outperformed the baseline by a large margin in the ranking variant.",
        "The aim of task 1.3 aimed at predicting post-editing time using a dataset composed of 800 English-Spanish news sentences also translated by Moses but post-edited by five expert translators.",
        "Evaluation was done based on MAE and RMSE on a blind test set.",
