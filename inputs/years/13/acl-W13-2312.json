        "Over the past decade, corpora with multiple layers of linguistic annotation have been developed in order to extend the range of empirically-based linguistic research and enable study of interlayer interactions.",
        "Recently created corpora include OntoNotes (Pradhan et al., 2007), the Groningen Meaning Bank (Basile et al., 2012), and the Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC)1 (Ide et al., 2010).",
        "Typically, such corpora are represented in idiosyncratic in-house formats, and developers provide special software to access and query the annotations (for example, the OntoNotes ?db tool?",
        "and Groningen's GMB Explorer).",
        "Access without the use of developer-supplied software often requires significant programming expertise, and as a result, it is not easy?or even possible?for others to add to or modify data and annotations in the resource.",
        "This paper describes the importation of MASC data and annotations into the linguistic database",
        "2009), which was designed to visualize and query linguistically-annotated corpora.",
        "Unlike most other corpora with multilayer annotations, no special software has been developed for access to MASC.",
        "Instead, all MASC data and annotations are represented in GrAF (Ide and Suderman, 2007), the XML serialization of the abstract model for annotations defined by ISO TC37 SC4's Linguistic Annotation Framework (ISO/LAF) (Ide and Suderman, In press).",
        "GrAF is intended to serve as a generic ?pivot?",
        "format that is isomorphic to annotation schemes conforming to the abstract model and therefore readily mappable to schemes used in available systems.",

        "The ANNIS system is a linguistic database geared toward the requirements of querying multilayer annotated corpora, and providing various visualization means for layers with different structural properties.",
        "In particular, the annotation types supported are spans, DAGs with labelled edges, and pointing relations between terminals or non-terminals.",
        "For illustration, Figure 1 shows a screenshot where various parallel annotations of the same data are provided: dependency trees, constituent trees (here with ?secondary edges?",
        "in dotted lines), and a grid view for annotations that assign labels to token spans.",

        "MASC is a fully open, half-million word corpus covering nineteen diverse genres of American English drawn from the Open American National Corpus (OANC)4.",
        "The corpus includes manually produced or hand-validated annotations for multiple linguistic layers, including morphosyntax (two different annotations), shallow parse (noun and verb chunks), Penn Treebank syntax, and named entities.",
        "Portions of the corpus are also annotated for FrameNet frames, opinion, Prop-Bank predicate-arguments, and WordNet 3.1 word senses.",
        "Discourse-level annotation, including coreference, clauses, and discourse markers, will be available in fall, 2013.",
        "Like the OANC, all MASC annotations are rendered in standoff form using GrAF, the graph-based format developed as a part of the ISO Linguistic Annotation Framework (ISO/LAF)(ISO 24612, 2012).",
        "GrAF is an XML serialization of the LAF abstract model for annotations, a formalization of models used across multiple applications for associating (linking) information, including not only directed-acyclic graphs (DAGs) but also ER diagrams, the Universal Mod-eling Language (UML), semantic and neural networks, RDF/OWL, and, more generally, hyper-linked data on the World Wide Web.",
        "The model is sufficiently general to represent any type of linguistic annotation; any serialization of the model can therefore serve as a pivot or intermediary among diverse annotation formats that conform to the abstract model.",
        "Thus, any sufficiently well",
        "formed annotation scheme should be isomorphic to a GrAF representation of the same information.",
        "Problems arise only when a scheme does not specify information explicitly but rather embeds the interpretation in processing software rather than in the representation itself; for transduction to GrAF, this information must be made explicit in the representation.",
        "Funding for MASC did not allow for extensive software development; the expectation is that by rendering the corpus in the ISO standard GrAF format, access could rely on GrAF-aware software developed by others, or transduction from GrAF to appropriate alternative formats would be trivial.",
        "We have already developed and deployed means to import linguistic data represented in GrAF into UIMA, GATE, and NLTK, and we provide transducers from GrAF to inline XML and the CoNLL IOB format.5 Additionally, a GrAF-to-RDF transducer is near completion, which will enable inclusion of MASC in the Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) cloud6.",

        "Most of the conversion is straightforward, since both models are graph-based.",

        "Explicit labels in ANNIS are required in order to generate the appropriate visualizations automatically (e.g. trees for syntactic hierarchies and arc diagrams for syntactic dependencies).",
