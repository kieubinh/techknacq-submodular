        "Researchers have exploited manually-built treebanks to build statistical parsers that improve in accuracy every year.",
        "This success is due in part to the fact that we have a single, whole-sentence parsing task, rather than separate tasks and evaluations for base noun identification, prepositional phrase attachment, trace recovery, verb-argument dependencies, etc.",
        "Those smaller tasks are naturally solved as a by-product of whole-sentence parsing, and in fact, solved better than when approached in isolation.",
        "By contrast, semantic annotation today is balkanized.",
        "We have separate annotations for named entities, co-reference, semantic relations, discourse connectives, temporal entities, etc.",
        "Each annotation has its own associated evaluation, and training data is split across many resources.",
        "We lack a simple readable sembank of English sentences paired with their whole-sentence, logical meanings.",
        "We believe a sizable sembank will lead to new work in statistical natural language understanding (NLU), resulting in semantic parsers that are as ubiquitous as syntactic ones, and support natural language generation (NLG) by providing a logical semantic input.",
        "Of course, when it comes to whole-sentence semantic representations, linguistic and philosophical work is extensive.",
        "We draw on this work to design an Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) appropriate for sembanking.",

        "AMR aims to abstract away from syntactic idiosyncrasies.",
        "We attempt to assign the same AMR to sentences that have the same basic meaning.",

        "are all assigned the same AMR.",
        "?",
        "AMR makes extensive use of PropBank framesets (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002; Palmer et al., 2005).",
        "For example, we represent a phrase like ?bond investor?",
        "using the frame ?invest-01?, even though no verbs appear in the phrase.",
        "?",
        "AMR is agnostic about how we might want to derive meanings from strings, or vice-versa.",
        "In translating sentences to AMR, we do not dictate a particular sequence of rule applications or provide alignments that reflect such rule sequences.",
        "This makes sembanking very fast, and it allows researchers to explore their own ideas about how strings",
        "are related to meanings.",

        "It is not an Interlingua.",
