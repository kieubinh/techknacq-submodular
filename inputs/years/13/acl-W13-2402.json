        "An automatic extraction of opinions from a text has become an area of growing interest in the recent years.",

        "Thus sentiment classification helps solving many various tasks, ranging from a very general to the very specific, requiring special solutions.",
        "Majority of tasks consider the content in general by focusing on the subjectivity vs. objectivity or semantic orientation (positive vs. negative) detection of reviews, tweets, blogs, or Internet comments.",
        "Others are solving very specific tasks, e.g. early threats detection (Bouma et al., 2012), prediction of user's potentiality to send out offensive content (Chen et al., 2012), etc.",
        "But even adaptation to the task is not always effective due to the variations and complexity of the language.",
        "Sentiments are not always expressed explicitly, while for the meanings hidden in the context additional world knowledge is necessary.",
        "Moreover, sentiments may involve sarcasm and be interpreted differently in various domains and contexts.",
        "Despite all the mentioned difficulties, sentiment classification task is rather easy for us, humans, but manual analysis is time consuming and requires a lot of human-resources.",
        "Due to this fact automatic sentiment classifiers are often selected instead.",

        "Due to the complexity of sentiment classification task, there is a vast variety of methods trying to tackle this problem (for review see Pang and Lee (2008)).",
        "All methods used to solve sentiment classification task fall into the three main categories: knowledge-based, machine learning and hybrid.",
        "In knowledge-based approaches sentiment is seen as the function of keywords (usually based on their count).",
        "Thus the main task is the construction of sentiment discriminatory-word lexicons with indicated class labels (positive or negative) and sometimes even with their intensiveness.",
        "Lexicons are constructed either manually (Taboada et al., 2011) or semi-automatically making use of such resources as WordNet (Hu and Liu, 2004); (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) or via word associations based on the heuristics evaluating word's occurrence alongside with the ?seed?",
        "words in the text (Turney, 2002); (Turney and Littman, 2003).",
        "Adjectives (or adjectival phrases) are considered as the most popular sentiment indicators, e.g. Benamara et al. (2007) claim that adjectives and adverbs (chosen based on the proposed adverb scoring technique) give much better results than adjectives alone; Taboada et al. (2011) show that such lexical items as nouns and verbs (not only adjectives and adverbs) can also carry important semantic polarity information.",
        "Ding and Liu (2007) argue that semantic orientation is content dependent task and words alone are not sufficient sentiment indicators thus incorporate them into the set of linguistic rules used in classification; Choi and Cardie (2008) use heuristics based on the compositional semantics (considering the effect of interactions among the words) and achieve better results over the methods not incorporating it; Taboada et al. (2011) take into account valence shifters (intensifiers, downtoners, negation and irrealis markers) that influence the polarity of the neighboring words for English; Kuznetsova et al. (2013) ?",
        "for Russian.",
        "An alternative for the knowledge-based methods is machine learning that in turn can be grouped into supervised and clustering techniques.",
        "Clustering is rarely used due to the low accuracy, but the drawback of supervised machine learning (that we will further focus on) is that for model creation a training dataset (with manually preassigned sentiment class labels) is required.",
        "The main issue for supervised machine learning techniques is proper selection of features.",
        "Nevertheless, the most basic approach remains bag-of-words interpretation.",
        "Pang et al. (2002) show that bag-of-words beat other feature types (based on token bigrams, parts-of-speech information and word position in the text) with Support Vector Machine (SVM) method.",
        "But on the contrary, Dave et al. (2003) report that token n-grams (up to trigrams) can improve the performance compared with simple unigrams; Cui et al. (2006) with higher order token n-grams (n = 3, 4, 5, 6) and Passive Aggressive classifier outperform unigrams and bigrams; Pak and Parubek (2011) with token bigrams and Na?",
        "?ve Bayes Multinomial method outperform both token unigrams and trigrams.",
        "Dave et al. (2003) also report that stemming improves accuracy compared with the bag-of-words baseline, but other linguistic features (negation, collocations of words, etc.)",
        "on the contrary ?",
        "hurt the performance.",
        "Raaijmakers and Kraaij (2008) use document-level character n-grams (n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) with SVM (geodesic kernel); Hartmann et al. (2011) claim that document-level character n-grams used, namely, with Na?",
        "?ve Bayes method are even better choice than token n-grams (because the probability of finding character n-gram is much higher and the relations between consecutive words are still considered).",
        "Hybrid approaches combine both knowledge-based and machine learning methods thus achieving superior performance.",
        "As it is demonstrated by Mullen and Collier (2004) using SVM and combined token unigram features with those based on favorability measures (for phrases, adjectives and even knowledge of topic).",
        "Sentiment classification results can be influenced by preprocessing as well.",
        "E.g. Kennedy and Inkpen (2006) claim that valence shifters and Mukherjee and Bhattacharyya (2012) show that discourse information incorporated into bag-of-words improve classification accuracy both for knowledge-based and SVM methods.",
        "But often preprocessing techniques (such as emoticons replacement, negation treatment and stop words removal) are selected without any considerations (e.g. see in (Pak and Paroubek, 2011)).",
        "Both knowledge-based and supervised machine learning methods are domain-dependent (when classifier trained in one domain can barely beat the baseline in the other) and, moreover, domain-sensitive.",
        "E.g. Aue and Gamon (2005) with Na?",
        "?ve Bayes and SVM classifiers show that different types of features work better across different domains; therefore usually methods are built for the specific selected domain.",
        "Sometimes domain-dependent problem is circumvented by extracting related content with manually created rules (Wang et al., 2012) or via machine learning: i.e. by",
        "performing topicality classification at the first step and sentiment afterwards (Hurst and Nigam, 2004).",
        "Read and Carroll (2009) solve domain-depended problem by using special methodology to build the classifiers that are robust across the different domains.",
        "Hence sentiment classification is domain and task dependent problem.",
        "Moreover, the performance of selected method can also depend on the language.",
        "E.g. Boiy and Moens (2009) demonstrate that the best accuracy with token unigrams (augmented with linguistics features) is obtained using Na?",
        "?ve Bayes Multinomial for English, SVM for Dutch and Maximum Entropy for French language.",
        "Besides, some solutions are proposed for multilingual texts as well, e.g. Cheng and Zhu-lyn (2012) show that generalized bigram model (especially suitable for the languages with a flexible word order) using Na?",
        "?ve Bayes and logistic regression classifiers can achieve high accuracy on different Germanic, Roman and East Asian languages.",
        "We cannot provide any example of experiments based on sentiment classification for Lithuanian.",

        "For both machine learning methods token lemmas are effective enough.",
        "The main problem is that Lithuanian lemmatizer could not recognize even a quarter of all words in the dataset, thus it can be assumed that this feature type could give even better results if lemmatizer would cope with informal Lithuanian language as well.",
        "Results obtained by machine learning methods show that document-level character 4-grams (giving the best results for topic classification on Lithuanian texts) are not effective for sentiment classification.",

        "It can be assumed that despite stop words seem unimportant; they still carry sentiment information, especially significant using token bigrams.",
        "As expected (see Section 4.3), machine learning methods significantly outperform knowledge-based.",
        "One of the main reasons is that the lexicons are not adjusted to a specific domain.",
