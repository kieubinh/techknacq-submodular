        "A syntactic parser inputs a sentence and produces information on syntactic relationships between parts of the sentence.",
        "It is an open question which method is the most convenient one to represent these relationships.",
        "In this paper, we are focusing on two of those methods.",
        "The first one, a constituency tree (CT), is a representation of a sentence by a set of nested fragments ?",
        "groups, each group corresponding to a syntactically coherent phrase.",
        "The second one, a dependency tree (DT), expresses relationships by a set of syntactic links between pairs of tokens.",
        "Figure 1 demonstrates correspondence between CT and DT: one is clearly derivable from another.",
        "In applications, one usually needs to transform CT into DT due to the following fact: if a tree is correct, then subjects, objects and adverbials of some predicate X are always direct children of the node X in DT.",
        "With a traditional CT framework these children can be obtained in much less intuitive way by browsing up and down through constituents, as shown in Figure 1 by dotted lines.",
        "According to this comparison, DT transparently maps onto the level of semantic representation, \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0002\u0004 \u0005\u0006\u0007 \b \u0002 \u0003 \u000e\u000f Adj N V Pr N NP VP NP PP AP NP VP S Ctrl.",

        "Constituency parsing.",
        "Despite the usefulness of DT-s, CT-s have a longer history of application as a computational model.",
        "For now, probabilistic constituency parser by (Charniak, 1997) and its derivatives are considered the state of the art for English.",
        "Unfortunately, the framework of constituency parsing, taken alone, is not productive for languages such as Russian.",
        "It turns out that the number of rules in a grammar start to grow fast if one tries to describe an inflecting language with a free word order explicitly.",
        "As a result, pure constituency parsers are not well known for Russian.",
        "It has recently been confirmed by a Russian syntactic parsers task at the Dialogue conference (see http://www.dialog-21.ru), at which several parsers were presented and all of them used DT formalism as a basis.",

        "Modern algorithmic approaches to dependency parsing are based on machine learning techniques and are supported by open-source implementations.",
        "Unfortunately, large DT-s corpora are not widely available for Russian to train these parsers.",
        "The need for the corpora also brings complications when one wants to achieve high precision parsing a given subject domain, and then to switch to parse another do-main: eventually one will need a separate corpus for each domain.",
        "There is a consent among researches that a ?long tail?",
        "of special error cases is definitely hard to fix in pure machine learning frameworks (Sharov and Nivre, 2011), while it is necessary for high precision.",
        "In contrast to En-glish, dependency parsing is traditional for Russian computational linguistics.",
        "As a result, modern Russian parsers produce DT-s.",
        "These parsers are mainly rule-based with an optional statistical component (Toldova et al., 2012) and standard expert-verified data sets such as verb subcatego-rization frames, which are called ?control models?",
        "or ?set of valences?",
        "in Russian.",
        "None of the rule-based parsers that were presented at the Dialogue task are freely available.",
        "Unfortunately, the practice of using DT-s has revealed some of their significant deficiencies.",
        "The most frequently discussed one is the representation of homogenous parts of the sentence (Testelets, 2001).",
        "Figure 2 shows some known methods.",
        "One can observe that there must be a syntactic agreement between the group of homogenous parts 1-3 and their parent 4-61 by Number, which is Plural, but it is impossible to capture this relation in a DT where only words can hold grammar values.",
        "No representation among A-E in Figure 2 keeps this information for the group.",
        "Things get worse if one tries to represent an agreement for two groups of homogenous parts, like in 2.F.",
        "In addition, it is common to modify the parsing algorithm, but not the set of decision rules, directly in order to get nonprojective2 DT-s (Mc- 1In examples, we put indices for words in correspondence with English translation (often with omitted articles ?a?, ?the?",

        "In (Wang and Zong, 2010) a third-party black-box dependency parser is used to improve the results of author's constituency parser, achieving 10% boost in F1.",
        "Additionally, there is evidence that ABBYY Compreno (Anisimovich et al., 2012) tracks the order in sequences of consecutive tokens so it actually exploits some kind of constituents throughout the process of dependency parsing.",
        "In this paper, we propose a method of representing a parse tree, which is a combination of CT and DT and eliminates some disadvantages of both.",
        "Then we describe syntactic rules that guide the process of simultaneous bottom-up acquisition of multiple syntactically ambiguous DT-s and CT-s for a given sentence, ranked by syntactic relevance.",
        "In addition, we discuss some properties of the rule base that is built in the framework of proposed rules description language.",
        "After that, we show that it is possible to extend the classical Cocke-Younger-Kasami algorithm (Kasami, 1965) to use grammar rules of arbitrary arity without grammar binarization and to exploit intermediate DT-s to increase efficiency.",
        "Moreover, we demonstrate how to achieve a reasonable ranking of solutions without using any additional statistical information.",
        "In conclusion, we discuss possible extensions of the approach.",
        "2 Representing the Parse Tree Our goal is to achieve the most complete representation of syntactic relations between words and/or chunks of a given sentence.",
        "The subject of semantic representation, e.g. semantic labeling of predicate participants or questions on the edges, are not discussed further.",
        "We assume that such information can be surfaced either during the process of analysis or directly afterwards by semantic interpretation of resulting parse trees.",
        "As it was mentioned, it is possible to avoid disadvantages of DT-s if one finds a way to bring additional vertices to these trees.",
        "Though it is not natural for DT-s to have such vertices, it is common for constituents in CT-s to acquire derived grammar values.",
        "Thereafter, instead of building a parse tree of a completely new type, we obtain the representation that consists of three compo-nents: 1) constituency tree ?",
        "CT, 2) dependency tree ?DT, 3) hybrid tree ?HT.",
        "CT strictly corresponds to a system of syntactic rules given prelim-inarily, and DT is built by instructions from rules at each step of the bottom-up analysis driven by this system.",
        "A hybrid representation, HT, that is based on DT but depicts homogenous parts, dependent clauses and nested sentences in a particular way.",
        "As a next step, we declare a balanced system of agreements between these different representations.",
        "Assumptions for a constituency tree.",
        "We only require that CT correctly corresponds to the given sentence, and phrases of CT do not need to correspond to the expected expressions of VP, NP, AP etc.",
        "E.g., one can declare a specific rule that generates a constituent that simultaneously corresponds to a subject and a verb, e.g.",
        "\u0010??????",
        "????????",
        "???????",
        "?\u0011 .",
        "Such a phrase corresponds both to VP and NP and is atypical, but the corresponding rule can produce a proper fragment of a nonprojective DT and HT, which is the main goal in this context.",
        "To summarize, in the proposed model constituencies play an utilitarian role, they are treated like carriers for parts of DT and are borrowed at certain decision points to form a resulting HT.",
        "Assumptions for a dependency tree.",
        "During the parsing, a hypothesis of syntactic locality is considered, that states: tokens that are close linearly in a sentence are more likely to have a syntactic relationship.",
        "If there are several methods to represent a syntactic phenomenon, we choose a method that fits it best.",
        "Recalling Figure 2, one can observe that in 2.A and 2.B two links correspond to different linear distances between corresponding vertices, while in C?F each link corresponds to a unity distance.",
        "Let us call the latter kind of homogeneity representation ?a chain scheme?",
        "and require syntactic rules to follow it.",
        "The following assumptions are made: 1) prepositions become roots of the corresponding prepositional phrases; 2) subordinate conjunctions become roots of the corresponding dependent clauses; 3) punctuation marks, quotes and coordination conjunctions are removed from DT and will be properly presented in HT.",
        "The following link types are expected: agreement (Adj+Noun, Noun+Noun, etc), control 36 (Verb+Noun, prepositional phrases etc), contiguity (for adverbs, particles etc.",
        "), isolation for dependent clauses and coordination for chains of homogenous parts.",
        "For cases when a synthesized grammar value is needed like in Figure 2.G, we do not expect a special new vertex to be introduced in DT.",
        "Instead, each vertex of DT contains a reference to the corresponding constituency in CT, which holds its own grammar value.",
        "By de-fault, this value is inherited from the head element of the constituent, but can be overridden, which is the case for homogeneity.",
        "Assumptions for a hybrid tree are revealed by the example in Figure 3, where an XML-file is represented for a HT of a sentence with two dependent clauses 8-11 and 12-19, a nested sentence 1-19 and homogenous nouns 17 and 19.",
        "Only significant details are shown in the figure ?",
        "shortened grammar values (N for Noun etc) as GV and wordforms as W. Full representation also includes normal forms, detailed grammar values, to-kens?",
        "positions and link types.",
        "Subordinate clauses are presented under Subord tag as a nested group, while nested sentences are located under S tag.",
        "The group of two homogenous nouns is placed under Coord, but, unlike corresponding DT, homogenous members do not form a chain and are located on a single level inside a special Group tag.",
        "Such Group can have any number of dependent elements which are placed between </Group> and </Coord> (shown in Figure 4 below).",
        "There, the agreement by number between the group of two nouns 2-4 and the adjective 1 is taken into account, and the adverb 10 adjoins to the group of verbs 6 and 9 but not to a single verb.",
        "An intensive research has been performed by (Okatiev et al., 2010) on the role of punctuation for Russian.",
        "According to it, one has to distinguish roles of punctuation marks and conjunctions (which together are called junctions) to deduce correct parses.",
        "For this reason roles are marked in a hybrid XML tree.",
        "One punctuation mark or a conjunction can possess several roles: it can be an isolator (Isol, bounds dependent phrases), a separator (Sepr, is used to separate homogenous parts inside coordinated groups) and a connector (Conn, indicates nested sentences, e.g. quotation marks).",
        "Isolators and connectors always play an opening or a closing role for one or several clauses.",
