        "Merging the test sets by language mostly evens out the tagging differences as there is a total of 173 MSD confusions in Croatian test sets and only 3 more, i.e., 175 in the Serbian test sets.",
        "POS scores for both languages neared the level of human error in our experiment.",
        "Keeping that in mind, upon observing the confusion instances themselves, we spotted a confusion between adjectives and nouns (e.g. names of countries (Hrvatska (en.",
        "Croatia, Croatian)), homographic forms (strana (en.",
        "foreign, side), svet (en.",
        "world, holy)) and confusion between adjectives and adverbs.",
        "Adverbs and prepositions are sometimes confused with nouns, especially for nouns in instrumental case (e.g. godinama (en.",
        "year, yearly), tijekom (en.",
        "duration, during)).",
        "Conjuctions are at times incorrently tagged because various words can have a conjuctional function, most frequently pronouns and adverbs: s?to (en.",
        "what), kako (en.",
        "how), kada (en.",
        "when).",
        "Interestingly, there is some confusion between nouns and verbs in Wikipedia test sets, while in SETimes test sets there are almost none.",
        "This confusion arises from the homographic forms ?",
        "e.g. mora (en.",
        "must, seas) ?",
        "or from nouns with 17There are 589 MTE v5r3 tags in SETIMES.HR.",
        "Out of these, 164 are used for tagging adjectives, 42 for nouns and 268 for pronouns, thus accounting for 80.47% of the tagset.",
        "There are also 50 verb tags.",
        "participles in feminine and neuter gender, or with suffix -ti, which is also a suffix for infinitive.",
        "Most MSD tag confusions arise from the fact that the same suffix can denote different cases in different declensions.",
        "We observed confused number and gender category (mostly in adjectives in masculine and neuter gender), but the most frequent confusion occurs for accusative forms in masculine gender, which have different suffixes when they denote animacy (suffix is the same as in the genitive case: pobjednika (en.",
        "winner), kandidata (en.",
        "candidate)) and when they denote inanimacy (suffix is the same as in the nominative case: metak (en.",
        "bullet), bubnjar (en.",
        "drummer)).",
        "In lemmatization, as in POS tagging, errors are generally very infrequent.",
        "Some occur with adjectives, when an assigned lemma represents a definite form of an adjective, instead of an indefinitive form (and less frequently vice versa).",
        "Besides, adjectives are sometimes confused with adverbs (e.g., target lemma is znac?ajno (en.",
        "significantly), but the lemma znac?ajan (en.",
        "significant) is assigned, and vice versa).",
        "Other less frequent examples include cases in which the assigned lemma is not in its canonical form, but a case other than the nominative case, or when the assigned lemma is a word stem.",
        "A small number of errors also occurs due to slight differences in Croatian and Serbian word-forms, e.g., when a Serbian nominative form is not a nominative form in Croatian (planeta as Serbian nominative and Croatian genitive, planet being the Croatian nominative).",
        "Figure 1 provides lemmatization, POS and MSD tagging learning curves for both languages on merged test sets.",
        "Apart from the slight difference in lemmatization scores in favor of Croatian, the learning curves and overall scores on merged test sets are virtually identical.",
        "The easiest task to learn is lemmatization while the most complex one is applying MSD."

        "or, more desireably, how easy and straightforward ?",
        "would it be to port linguistic resources and language processing tools from one language to another.",
        "While developing the models, we completed a series of experiments.",

        "Using SETimes and Wikipedia as starting point resources, we created two gold standard test sets for each language in order to test existing state-of-the-art lemmatizers and taggers.",
        "We ran preliminary tests on a number of tools to select CST lemmatizer and HunPos tagger as tools of choice considering observed accuracy, training time and text processing time.",
        "In an in-depth evaluation of these tools, we obtained peak overall lemmatization accuracy of 97.87% and 96.30% for Croatian and Serbian and full morphosyntactic tagging accuracy of 87.72% and 85.56%, with basic part of speech tagging accuracy at 97.13% and 96.46%.",
        "In this specific test scenario and with this specific training set, we have shown the differences in results between Croatian and Serbian not to be significant enough to justify an effort in more elaborate strategy of adapting Croatian models to Serbian data ?",
        "simply training the models on Croatian text from SETIMES.HR corpus and using them on Serbian text provided state-of-the-art results in lemmatization and tagging, while maintaining and even topping previously documented state of the art for Croatian.",

        "Should dependency parsing experiments show the need for more elaborate language adaptation strategies, we will most likely implement them also on the level of lemmas and morphosyntactic tags before addressing syntactic issues.",
