        "Cooccurrences play an important role in many corpus based approaches in the field of natural-language processing (Dagan et al., 1993).",
        "They represent the observable evidence that can be distilled from a corpus and are employed for a variety of applications such as machine translation (Brown et al., 1992), information retrieval (Maarek and Smadja, 1989), word sense disambiguation (Brown et al., 1991), etc.",
        "In bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora, frequency counts for word pairs often serve as a basis for distributional methods, such as the standard approach (Fung, 1998) which compares the cooccurrence profile of a given source word, a vector of association scores for its translated cooc-currences (Fano, 1961; Dunning, 1993), with the profiles of all words of the target language.",
        "The distance between two such vectors is interpreted as an indicator of their semantic similarity and their translational relation.",
        "If using association measures to extract word translation equivalents has shown a better performance than using a raw cooccurrence model, the latter remains the core of any statistical generalisation (Evert, 2005).",
        "As has been known, words and other type-rich linguistic populations do not contain instances of all types in the population, even the largest samples (Zipf, 1949; Evert and Baroni, 2007).",
        "Therefore, the number and distribution of types in the available sample are not reliable estimators (Evert and Baroni, 2007), especially for small comparable corpora.",
        "The literature suggests two major approaches for solving the data sparseness problem: smoothing and class-based methods.",
        "Smoothing techniques (Good, 1953) are often used to better estimate probabilities when there is insufficient data to estimate probabilities accurately.",
        "They tend to make distributions more uniform, by adjusting low probabilities such as zero probabilities upward, and high probabilities downward.",
        "Generally, smoothing methods not only prevent zero probabilities, but they also attempt to improve the accuracy of the model as a whole (Chen and Goodman, 1999).",
        "Class-based models (Pereira et al., 1993) use classes of similar words to distinguish between unseen cooccur-rences.",
        "The relationship between given words is modeled by analogy with other words that are in some sense similar to the given ones.",
        "Hence, class-based models provide an alternative to the independence assumption on the cooccurrence of given words w1 and w2: the more frequent w2 is, the higher estimate of P (w2|w1) will be, regardless of w1.",
        "Starting from the observation that smoothing estimates ignore the expected degree of association between words (assign the same estimate for all unseen cooccurrences) and that class-based models may not structure and generalize word cooccurrence to class cooccurrence patterns without losing too much information, (Dagan et al., 1993) proposed an alternative to these latter approaches to estimate the probabilities of unseen cooccurrences.",
        "They presented a method that makes analogies between each specific unseen cooccurrence and other cooccurrences that contain similar words.",
        "The analogies are based on the assumption that similar word cooccurrences have similar values of mutual information.",
        "Their method has shown significant improvement for both: word sense disambiguation in machine translation and data recovery tasks.",
        "(Pekar et al., 2006) employed the nearest neighbor variety of the previous approach to extract translation equivalents for low frequency words from comparable corpora.",
        "They used a distance-based averaging technique for smoothing (Dagan et al., 1999).",
        "Their method yielded a significant improvement in relation to low frequency words.",
        "Starting from the assumption that smoothing improves the accuracy of the model as a whole (Chen and Goodman, 1999), we believe that smoothed context vectors should lead to better performance for bilingual terminology extraction from comparable corpora.",
        "In this work we carry out an empirical comparison of the most widely-used smoothing techniques, including additive smoothing (Lidstone, 1920), Good-Turing estimate (Good, 1953), Jelinek-Mercer (Mercer, 1980), Katz (Katz, 1987) and kneser-Ney smoothing (Kneser and Ney, 1995).",
        "Unlike (Pekar et al., 2006), the present work does not investigate unseen words.",
        "We only concentrate on observed cooccurrences.",
        "We believe it constitutes the most systematic comparison made so far with different smoothing techniques for aligning translation equivalents from comparable corpora.",
        "We show that using smoothing as a preprocessing step of the standard approach, leads to significant improvement even without considering unseen cooccurrences.",

        "Smoothing techniques are often evaluated on their ability to predict unseen n-grams.",
        "In our experiments we only focused on smoothing observed cooccurrences of context vectors.",
        "Hence, the previous evaluations of smoothing techniques may not always be consistent with our findings.",
        "This is for example the case for the additive smoothing technique.",
        "The latter which is described as a poor estimator in statistical NLP, turns out to perform well when associated with the Log-Jac parameters.",
        "This is because we did not consider unseen cooccurences which are over estimated by the Add-one smoothing.",
        "Obviously, we can imagine that adding one to all unobserved cooccurrences would not make sense and would certainly degrade the results.",
        "Except the add-one smoothing, none of the other algorithms reached good results when associated to the Log-Jac configuration.",
        "This is certainly related to the properties of the log-likelihood association measure.",
        "Additive smoothing has been used to address the problem of rare words aligning to too many words (Moore, 2004).",
        "At each iteration of the standard Expectation-Maximization (EM) procedure all the translation probability estimates are smoothed by adding virtual counts to uniform probability distribution over all target words.",
        "Here also additive smoothing has shown interesting results.",
        "According to these findings, we can consider the additive smoothing as an appropriate technique for our task.",
        "Concerning the Odds-Cos parameters, although there have been slight improvements in the add-one algorithm, smoothing techniques have shown disappointing results.",
        "Here again the Odds-ratio association measure seems to be incompatible with re-estimating small cooccurrences.",
        "More investigations are certainly needed to highlight the reasons for this poor performance.",
        "It seems that smoothing techniques based on discounting does not fit well with association measures based on contingency table.",
        "The most noticeable improvement concerns the PMI-Cos configurations.",
        "Except Kneser-Ney smoothing, all the other techniques showed better performance than the standard approach.",
        "According to the results, point-wise mutual information performs better with smoothing techniques especially with the linear interpolation of Jelinek-Mercer method that combines high-order (cooccurrences) and low-order (unigrams) counts of the Good-Turing estimations.",
        "Jelinek-Mercer smoothing counteracts the disadvantage of the point-wise mutual information which consists of over estimating less frequent words.",
        "This latter weakness is corrected first by the Good-Turing estimators and then by considering the low order counts.",
        "The best performance was obtained with ?",
        "= 0.5.",
        "Smoothing techniques attempt to improve the accuracy of the model as a whole.",
        "This particularity has been confirmed by the third experiment where we noticed the smoothing improvements for both reference lists, that is the High-test and Low-test sets.",
        "This latter experiment has shown that smoothing observed cooccurrences is useful for all frequency ranges.",
        "The difference of precision between the two test lists can be explained by the fact that less frequent words are harder to translate.",
        "In statistical NLP, smoothing techniques for n-gram models have been addressed in a number of studies (Chen and Goodman, 1999).",
        "The ad",
        "ditive smoothing that performs rather poorly has shown good results in our evaluation.",
        "The Good-Turing estimate which is not used in isolation forms the basis of later techniques such as Backoff or Jelinek-Mercer smoothing, two techniques that generally work well.",
        "The good performance of Katz and JM on the PMI-Cos configuration was expected.",
        "The reason is that these two methods have used the Good-Turing estimators which also achieved good performances in our experiments.",
        "Concerning the Kneser-Ney algorithm, surprisingly this performed poorly in our experiments while it is known to be one of the best smoothing techniques.",
        "Discounting a fixed amount in all counts of observed cooccurrences degrades the results in our data set.",
        "We also implemented the modified Knener-ney method (not presented in this paper) but this also performed poorly.",
        "We conclude that discounting is not an appropriate method for observed cooccurrences.",
        "Especially for point-wise mutual information that overestimates low frequencies, hense, discounting low cooccurrences will increase this overestimation."

        "In this paper, we have described and compared the most widely-used smoothing techniques for the task of bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora.",
        "Regarding the empirical results of our proposition, performance of smoothing on our dataset was better than the baseline for the Add-One smoothing combined with the Log-Jac parameters and all smoothing techniques except the Kneser-ney for the Pmi-Cos parameters.",
        "Our findings thus lend support to the hypothesis that a re-estimation process of word cooccurrence in a small specialized comparable corpora is an appropriate way to improve the accuracy of the standard approach."
