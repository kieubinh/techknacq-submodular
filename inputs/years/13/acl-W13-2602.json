        "One of the central problems in language acquisition is how phonetic categories are learned, an unsupervised learning problem involving mapping phonetic tokens that vary along continuous dimensions onto discrete categories.",
        "This task may be facilitated by languages?",
        "extensive reuse of a set of phonetic dimensions (Clements 2003), because learning one distinction (e.g., /b/?/p/ varying along the voice onset time (VOT) dimension) might help learn analogous distinctions (e.g., /d/? /t/, /g/?k/).",
        "Existing experimental evidence supports this view: both infants and adults generalize newly learned phonetic category distinctions to untrained sounds along the same dimension (McClaskey et al. 1983, Maye et al. 2008, Perfors & Dunbar 2010, Pajak & Levy 2011a).",
        "However, while many models have been proposed to account for learning of phonetic categories (de Boer & Kuhl 2003, Vallabha et al. 2007, McMurray et al. 2009, Feldman et al. 2009, Toscano & McMurray 2010, Dillon et al. 2013), there have been no computational proposals for how generalization to analogous distinctions may be accomplished.",
        "Here, we present a new simple model of generalization in phonetic category learning, formalized in a hierarchical Bayesian framework.",
        "The model captures our proposal that linguistic knowledge includes the possibility that category types in a language (such as voiced and voiceless) can be shared across sound classes (defined as previously learned category groupings, such as vowels, consonants, nasals, fricatives, etc.",
        "), thus naturally leading to generalization.",
        "One difficulty for the view that learning one distinction might help learn analogous distinctions is that there is variability in how the same distinction type is implemented phonetically for different sound classes.",
        "For example, VOT values are consistently lower for labials (/b/?/p/) than for velars (/g/?/k/) (Lisker & Abramson 1970), and the durations of singleton and geminate consonants are shorter for nasals (such as /n/?/nn/) than for voiceless fricatives (such as /s/?/ss/) (Giovanardi & Di Benedetto 1998, Mattei & Di Benedetto 2000).",
        "Improving on our basic model, we implement a modification that deals with this difficulty by explicitly building in the possibility for analogous categories along the same dimension to have different absolute phonetic values along that dimension (e.g., shorter overall durations for nasals than for fricatives).",

      "text": [
        "One important source of information for unsupervised learning of phonetic categories is the shape of the distribution of acoustic-phonetic cues.",
        "For example, under the assumption that each phonetic category has a unimodal distribution on a particular cue, the number of modes in the distribution of phonetic cues can provide information about the number of categories: a unimodal distribution along some continuous acoustic dimension, such as VOT, may indicate a single category (e.g., /p/, as in Hawaiian); a bimodal distribution may suggest a two-category distinction (e.g., /b/ vs. /p/, as in English); and a trimodal distribution implies a three-category distinction (e.g., /b/, /p/, and /ph/, as in Thai).",
        "Infants extract this distributional information from the speech signal (Maye et al. 2002, 2008) and form category representations focused around the modal values of categories (Kuhl 1991, Kuhl et al. 1992, Lacerda 1995).",
        "Furthermore, information about some categories bootstraps learning of others: infants exposed to a novel bimodal distribution along the VOT dimension for one place of articulation (e.g., alveolar) not only learn that novel distinction, but also generalize it to an analogous contrast for another (e.g., velar) place of articulation (Maye et al. 2008).",
        "This ability is preserved beyond infancy, and is potentially used during second language learning, as adults are also able to both learn from distributional cues and use this information when making category judgments about untrained sounds along the same dimensions (Maye & Gerken 2000, 2001, Perfors & Dunbar 2010, Pajak & Levy 2011a,b).",
        "The phonetic variability in how different sound classes implement the same distinction type might in principle hinder generalization across classes.",
        "However, there is evidence of generalization even in cases when sound classes differ in the exact phonetic implementation of a shared distinction type.",
        "For example, learning a singleton/geminate length contrast for the class of voiceless fricatives (e.g., /s/?/ss/, /f/?/ff/) generalizes to the class of sonorants (e.g., /n/?/nn/, /j/?/jj/) even when the absolute durations of sounds in the two classes are different ?",
        "overall longer for fricatives than for sonorants (Pajak & Levy 2011a) ?",
        "indicating that learners are able to accomodate the variability of phonetic cues across different sound classes.",

        "As a final note, we briefly discuss alternative ways of modeling generalization in phonetic category learning.",
        "In the model we described in this paper, whole categories are generalized from one class to another.",
        "However, one might imagine another approach to this problem where generalization is a byproduct of learners?",
        "attending more to the dimension that they find to be relevant for distinguishing between some categories in a language.",
        "That is, learners?",
        "knowledge would not include the expectation that whole categories may be shared across classes, as we argued here, but rather that a given phonetic dimension is likely to be reused to distinguish between categories in multiple sound classes.",
        "This intuition could be implemented in different ways.",
        "In a Dirichlet process model of category learning, the concentration parameter ?",
        "might be learned, and shared for all classes along a given phonetic dimension, thus producing a bias toward having a similar number of categories across classes.",
        "Alternatively, the variance of categories along a given dimension might be learned, and also shared for all classes.",
        "Under this scenario, learning category variance along a given dimension would help categorize novel sounds along that dimension.",
        "That is, two novel datapoints would be likely categorized into separate categories if the inferred variance along the relevant dimension was smaller than the distance between the datapoints, but into a single category if the inferred variance was comparable to that distance.",
        "Finally, this model assumes that sound classes are given in advance, and that only the categories within each class are learned.",
        "While this assumption may seem warranted for some types of perceptually dissimilar sound classes (e.g., consonants and vowels), and also may be appropriate for L2 acquisition, it is not clear that it is true for all sound classes that allow for generalization in infancy.",
        "It remains for future work to determine how learners may generalize while simultaneously learning the sound classes.",
        "We plan to pursue all these directions in future work with the ultimate goal of improving our understanding how human learners represent their linguistic knowledge and how they use it when acquiring a new language."
