        "Specifically, a number of priming studies have been conducted to demonstrate that event knowledge is responsible for facilitation of processing of words that denote events and their participants (Ferretti et al., 2001; McRae et al., 2005; Hare et al., 2009).",
        "The aim of our research is to investigate to which extent such event knowledge surfaces in linguistic distribution and can thus be captured by Distributional Semantic Models (henceforth, DSMs).",
        "In particular, we test the capabilities of bag-of-words DSMs in simulating priming data from the three aforementioned studies.",

        "and Lapata, 2007; Herdag?delen et al., 2009; McDonald and Brew, 2004).",
        "Therefore, in this work, we aim at a more specific contribution to the study of distributional modeling of priming: to identify the indexes of distributional relatedness that produce the best performance in simulating priming data and to assess the impact of specific model parameters on such performance.",
        "In addition to distance in the semantic space, traditionally used as an index of distributional relatedness in DSMs, we also introduce neighbor rank as a predictor of priming effects.",
        "Distance and a number of rank-based measures are compared with respect to their performance in two tasks: the identification of congruent primes on the basis of distributional relatedness to the targets (we measure accuracy in picking up the congruent prime) and the prediction of latency times (we measure correlation between distributional relatedness and reaction times).",
        "The results of our experiments show that neighbor rank is a better predictor than distance for priming data.",
        "Our approach to DSM evaluation constitutes a methodological contribution of this study: we use linear models with performance (accuracy or correlation) as a dependent variable and various model parameters as independent variables, instead of looking for optimal parameter combinations.",
        "This approach is robust to overfitting and allows to analyze the influence of individual parameters as well as their interactions.",
