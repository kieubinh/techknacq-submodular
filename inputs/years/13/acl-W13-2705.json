        "In recent years, automatic social media analysis (SMA) has emerged, not only as a major focus of attention within the academic NLP community, but as an area that is of increasing interest to a variety of business and public sectors organisations.",
        "Among the many social media platforms in use today, the one that has received the most attention is Twitter, the second most popular social media network in the world with over 400 million tweets sent each day.",
        "The popularity of Twitter as a target of SMA derives from both the public nature of tweets, and the availability of the Twitter API which provides a variety of flexible methods for scraping tweets from the live Twitter stream.",
        "A plethora of social media monitoring platforms now exist, that are mostly concerned with providing product marketing oriented services1.",
        "For example, brand monitoring services seek to provide companies with an understanding of what",
        "wiki lists 230 Social Media Monitoring Solutions is being said about their brands and products, with language processing technology being used to capture relevant comments or conversations and apply some form of sentiment analysis (SA), in order to derive insights into what is being said.",
        "This paper forms part of a growing body of work that is attempting to broaden the scope of SMA beyond the realm of product marketing, and into areas of concern to social scientists (Carvalho et al., 2011; Diakopoulos and Shamma, 2010; Gonzalez-Bailon et al., 2010; Marchetti-Bowick and Chambers, 2012; O?Connor et al., 2010; Tumasjan et al., 2011; Tumasjan et al., 2010).",
        "Social media presents an enormous opportunity for the social science research community, constituting a window into what large numbers of people are talking.",
        "There are, however, significant obstacles facing social scientists interested in making use of big social media datasets, and it is important for the NLP research community to gain a better understanding as to how language technology can support such explorations.",
        "A key requirement, and the focus of this paper, is agility: the social scientist needs to be able to engage with the data in a way that supports an iterative process, homing in on a way of analysing the data that is likely to produce valuable insight.",
        "Given what is typically a rather broad topic as a starting point, there is a need to see what issues related to that topic are being discussed and to what extent.",
        "It can be important to get a feeling for the kind of language being used in these discussions, and there is a need to rapidly assess the accuracy of the automated decision making.",
        "There is little value in developing an analysis of the data on an approach that relies on the technology making decisions that are so nuanced that the method being used is highly unreliable.",
        "As the answers to these questions are being exposed, insights emerge from the data, and it becomes possible for the social scientist to progressively refine the topics that are be",
        "ing targetted, and ultimately create a way of automatically analysing the data that is likely to be insightful.",
        "Supporting this agile methodology presents severe challenges from an NLP perspective, where the predominant approaches use classifiers that involve supervised machine learning.",
        "The need for substantial quantities of training data, and the detrimental impact on performance that results when applying them to ?out-of-domain?",
        "data mean that exisiting approaches cannot support the agility that is so important when social scientists engage with big social media datasets.",
        "We describe a tool being developed in collaboration with a team of social scientists to support this agile methodology.",
        "We have built a framework based on DUALIST, an active learning tool for building classifiers (Settles, 2011; Settles and Zhu, 2012).",
        "This framework provides a way for a group of social scientists to collaboratively engage with a stream of tweets, with a goal of constructing a chain (or cascade) of automatic document classification layers that isolate and analyse targeted conversions on Twitter.",
        "Section 4 discusses ways in which the design of our framework is intended to support the agile methodology mentioned above, with particular emphasis on the value of DUALIST's active learning approach, and the crucial role of the collaborative gold standard and model building activities.",
        "Section 4.3 discusses additional data processing step that have been introduced to increase the frameworks usefulness, and section 5 introduces some projects to which the framework is being applied."

        "This body of research involves little or no manual inspection of the data.",

        "in various ways.",
        "Further content analysis is then overlaid, such as sentiment or mood anlysis, in an attempt to improve performance.",

        "In Section 4, we discuss various ways in which we have extended DUALIST, including functionality allowing multiple annotators to work in parallel; incorporating functionality to create ?gold-standard?",

        "During the process of building a classifier, the annotator is presented with a selection of documents (in our case tweets) that he/she has an opportunity to label (with one of the class labels), and, for each class, a selection of features (tokens) that the annotator has an opportunity to mark as being strong features for that class.",
        "Active learning is used to select both the documents and the features being presented for annotation.",
        "Documents are selected on the basis of those that the current model is most uncertain about (as measured by posterior class entropy), and features are selected for a given class on the basis of those with highest information gain occurring frequently with that class.",
        "After a batch of documents and features have been annotated, a revised model is built using both the labelled data and the current model's predictions for the remaining unlabelled data, through the use of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm.",

        "Full details can be found in Settles (2011).",
        "The upshot of this is two-fold: not only can a reasonable model be rapidly created, but the researcher is exposed to an interesting non-uniform sample of the training data.",
        "Examples that are relatively easy for the model to classify, i.e. those with low entropy, are ranked lower in the list of unlabelled data awaiting annotation.",

        "An effective choice of query terms that actually achieves this is one of the things that is not well understood in advance, but which we expect to emerge during the data engagement phase.",
        "Capturing an input stream that contains a sufficiently large proportion of interesting (relevant) tweets is usually achieved at the expense of precision (the proportion of tweets in the stream being scraped that are relevant).",
        "As a result, the first task that is typically undertaken during the data engagement phase involves building a relevancy classifier, to be deployed at the top of the classifier cascade, that is designed to filter out irrelevant tweets from the stream of tweets being scraped.",

        "Our experience is that in many cases, classifiers at upper levels of the cascade are involved in decomposing data streams in useful ways, and classifiers that are lower down in the cascade are designed to measure some facet (e.g. sentiment polarity) of the material on some particular sub-stream."

        "Sentiment classifiers trained in one domain perform poorly when applied to another domain, even when the domains are apparently closely related (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "Traditionally, this has forced a choice between building bespoke classifiers (at significant cost), or using generic sentiment classifiers (which sacrifice performance).",
        "The ability to rapidly construct sentiment classifiers that are specifically tuned to the precise domain can significantly increase classifier performance without imposing major additional costs.",

        "References to individuals are often ambiguous.",
        "In the general case, word sense disambiguation is most successfully performed by supervised-learning classifiers (Ma`rquez et al., 2006), and the low cost of producing classifiers using this framework makes this approach practical for situations where we require repeated high recall, high precision searches of large data sets for a specific entity.",
