        "In this paper we describe an application of language technology to policy formulation, where it can support policy makers assess the acceptance of a yet-unpublished policy before the policy enters public consultation.",
        "One of the key concepts is that instead of relying on thematic similarity, we extract arguments expressed in support or opposition of positions that are general statements that are, themselves, consistent with the policy or not.",
        "The focus of this paper in this overall pipeline, is identifying arguments in text: we present and empirically evaluate the hypothesis that verbal tense and mood are good indicators of arguments that have not been explored in the relevant literature."

        "The large-scale acquisition, thematic classification, and sentiment analysis of Web content has been extensively applied to brand monitoring, digital reputation management, product development, and a variety of similar applications.",
        "More recently, it has also seen application in public policy validation, where the ?brand?",
        "to be monitored is a publicized and widely commented government policy.",
        "All these methods typically rely on the semantic similarity between a given text or set of terms and Web content; often using domain-specific ontological and terminological resources in order to measure this similarity.",
        "This approach, however requires that all parties involved discourse on the same topic; that is to say, that we are seeking the collective opinion of the Web on a topic that has been publicized enough to attract the attention of the Web.",
        "In this paper we present a slightly different approach, where we are looking for arguments expressed in support or opposition of opinions with little semantic similarity to our topic of interest.",
        "As a rough example, consider how drafting environmental policy can benefit from access to statistics about how people felt about industrial growth at the expense of environmental concerns when other policy in completely different domains was on public consultation: many of the arguments about the relative merits of industrial growth and environmental concerns can retain their structure and be thematically transferred to the new domain, helping draft a policy that best addresses people's concerns.",
        "Of paramount importance for implementing such an approach is the linguistic tools for identifying arguments.",
        "In this paper, we first motivate the inclusion of argument extraction inside the larger policy formulation and validation cycle and present the position of an argument extraction tool inside a computational system for supporting this cycle (Section 2).",
        "We then proceed to a present the argument extraction literature (Section 3) and our hypothesis that verbal morpho-syntactic features are good discriminators of arguments (Section 4).",
        "We close the paper by presenting and discussing empirical results (Section 5) and concluding (Section 6)."

        "Our work is carried out in the context of a project that develops computational tools for the early phases of policy making, before policy drafts have been made available for public consultation.1 At that stage, the policy's impact on public opinion cannot be estimated by similarity-based searching for relevant Web content, since the policy text has not been announced yet ?",
        "or even fully authored for that matter.",
        "One of the core",
        "ideas of the project is that in order to assist the policy formulation process, a tool needs to estimate the acceptance of a yet unpublished document based on Web content that is not thematically similar, but is rather supporting or opposing a more general position or maxim that also supports or opposes the policy under formulation.",
        "To make this more concrete, consider a new policy for increasing the penetration of wind power production, setting specific conditions and priorities.",
        "The project is developing an authoring environment where specific policy statements are linked to more general statements, such as:",
        "(1) Greenhouse gas emissions should not be a concern at all.",
        "(2) It is desired to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but this should be balanced against other concerns.",
        "(3) It is desired to reduce greenhouse gas",

        "(4) In case hard packaging is made compulsory by law, producers will be forced to consume more energy, leading to more greenhouse gas emissions.",
        "(5) Tidal power production does not emit greenhouse gases, but other environmental problems are associated with its widespread deployment.",
        "Leaving aside the ontological conceptualization that achieves this matching, which is reported elsewhere, we will now discuss the language processing pipeline that retrieves and classifies relevant Web content.",
        "Content is acquired via focused crawling, using search engine APIs to retrieve public Web pages and social network APIs to retrieve content from social content sharing platforms.",
        "Content is searched and filtered (in case of feed-like APIs) based on fairly permissive semantic similarity measures, emphasising a high retrieval rate at the expense of precision.",
        "As a second step, clean text is extracted from the raw Web content using the Boilerpipe library (Kohlschu?tter et al., 2010) in order to remove HTML tags, active components (e.g. JavaScript snippets), and content that is irrelevant to the main content (menus, ad sections, links to other web pages), and also to replace HTML entities with their textual equivalent, e.g., replacing ?&?",
        "with the character ?&?.",
        "The resulting text is tokenized and sentence-splitted and each sentence classified as relevant or not using standard information retrieval methods to assess the semantic similarity of each sentence to the general policy statements.",
        "This is based on both general-purpose resources2 and the domain ontology for the particular policy.",
        "Consecutive sentences that are classified as positive are joined into a segment.",
        "The main objective of the work described here is the classification of these segments as being representative of a stance that would also support or oppose the policy being formulated, given the premise of the general statements (1)?(3).",

        "That they are semantically similar to the general statements associated with the policy.",

        "That they are arguments, rather than statements of fact or other types of prose.",
        "?",
        "That their polarity towards the general statements is expressed.",
        "In order to be able to assess segments, we thus need a linguistic pipeline that can calculate semantic similarity, identify arguments, and extract their structure (premises/consequences) and polarity (in support or opposition).",
        "The focus of the work described here is identifying arguments, although we also outline how the features we are proposing can also be used in order to classify chunks of text as premises or consequences."

        "Our hypothesis is that future and conditional tenses and moods often indicate conjectures and hypotheses which are commonly used in argumentation techniques such as illustration, justification, rebuttal where the effects of a position counter to the speaker's argument are analysed.",
        "Naturally, such features cannot be the sole basis of argument identification, so we need to experiment regarding their interaction with discourse markers.",
        "To make this more concrete, consider the examples in Section 2: although both are perfectly valid arguments that can help us infer the acceptance or rejection of a policy, in the first one future tense is used to speculate about the effects of a policy; in the second example there is no explicit marker that the effects of large-scale tidal power production are also a conjecture.",

        "We describe here an application of language technology to policy formulation, and, in particular, to using Web content to assess the acceptance of a yet-unpublished policy before public consultation.",
        "The core of the idea is that classifying Web content as similar to the policy or not does apply, because the policy document has not been made public yet; but that we should rather extract arguments from Web content and assess whether these argue in favour or against general concepts that are (or are not) consistent with the policy being formulated.",
        "As a first step to this end, our paper focuses on the identification of arguments in Greek language content using shallow features.",
        "Based on our observation that verb tense appears to be a significant feature that is not exploited by the relevant literature, we have carried out an empirical evaluation of this hypothesis.",
        "We have, in particular, demonstrated that the relative frequency of each verb tense/mood and the binary appearance of each verb tense/mood inside a text segment are as discriminative of argumentative text as the (typically used) discourse markers; and that classification is improved by combining discourse marker features with our verbal tense/mood features.",
        "For doing this, we developed a regular grammar that combines the PoS tags of the members of a verb chunk in order to assign tense and mood to the chunk.",
        "In this manner, our approach depends on PoS taggin and chunking only.",
        "In subsequent steps of our investigation, we are planning to refine our approach to extracting argument structure: it would be interesting to test if argument premises tend to correlate with certain tenses or moods, distinguishing them from from conclusions.",
        "Further experiments can also examine if the simultaneous appearance of concrete tenses at the same sentence is an indicator of an argument.",
        "Finally, we plan to examine the predicates of an argument, and especially if the head word of each sentence (be it verb or deverbal noun) and its seat at the boundaries of the sentence may contribute to extract an argument or not, especially for impersonal, modal, and auxiliary verbs."
