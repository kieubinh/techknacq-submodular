        "Many researchers in political sciences either work qualitatively on small amounts of data which they interpret instance-wise, or, if they are interested in quantitative trends, they use comparatively simple tools, such as keyword-based search in corpora or text classification on the basis of terms only; this latter approach may lead to imprecise results due to a rather unspecific search as well as semantically invalid or ambigious search words.",
        "On the other hand, large amounts of e.g. news texts are available, also over longer periods of time, such that e.g. tendencies over time can be derived.",

        "), and Auslandseinsatz(?foreign intervention?)",
        "are used in the last two decades in newspaper texts about interventions and wars.",
        "The long-term goal of the project is to provide similar analysis for complex concepts.",
        "An example of a complex concept is the evocation of collective identities in political contexts, as indirect in the news.",
        "Examples for such collective identities are: the Europeans, the French, the Catholics.",
        "The objective of the work we are going to discuss in this paper is to provide NLP methods and tools for assisting political scientists in the exploration of large data sets, with a view to both, a detailed qualitative analysis of text instances, and a quantitative overview of trends over time, at the level of corpora.",
        "The examples discussed here have to do with (possibly multiple) collective identities.",

        "It allows its users to search for specific topics and automatically clusters articles from different sources.",
        "This is a key concept of the EMM, because it collects about 100, 000 articles in approximately 50 languages per day and it is impossible to scan through these by hand.",
        "EMM users are EU institutions, national institutions of the EU member states, international organisations and the public (Steinberger et al., 2009).",
        "The topic clusters provide insight into ?hot?",
        "topics by simply counting the amount of articles per cluster or by measuring the amount of news on a specific topic with regards to its normal amount of news.",
        "Articles are also data-mined for geographical information, e.g. to update in which geographical region the article was written and where the topic is located.",
        "Social network information is gathered and visualised as well.",
        "Major differences between the EMM and our approach are the user group and the domain of the corpus.",
        "The complex concepts political scientists are interested in are much more nuanced than the concepts relevant for topic detection and the construction of social networks.",
        "Additionally, the EMM does not allow its users to look for their own concepts and issues, while this interactivity is a central contribution of our approach (cf.",
        "Sections 1, 2.1 and 3.2).",
        "The CLARIN-D project also provides a web-based platform to create NLP-chains.",
        "It is called WebLicht (Hinrichs et al., 2010), but in its current form, the tool is not immediately usable for social scientists as the separation of metadata and textual data and the encoding of the data is hard for non-experts.",
        "Furthermore, WebLicht does not yet support the combination of manual and automatic annotation needed for text exploration in the social science.",
        "Our approach is based on the webservices used by WebLicht.",
        "But in contrast to WebLicht, we provide two additional components that simplify the integration (exploration workbench) and the interpretation (complex concept builder) of the research data.",
        "The former is intended, in the medium term, to be made available in the CLARIN framework."

        "We developed and implemented a pipeline of various text processing tools which is designed to assist political scientists in finding specific, complex concepts within large amounts of text.",
        "Our case studies showed that our approach can provide beneficial assistance for the research of political scientists as well as researcher from other social sciences and the humanities.",
        "A future aspect will be to find metrics to evaluate our pipeline.",
        "In recently started annotation experiments on topic classification Cohen's kappa coefficient (Carletta, 1996) is mediocre.",
        "It may very well be possible that the complex concepts, like multiple collective identities, are intrinsically hard to detect, and the annotations cannot be improved substantially.",
        "The extension of the NLP pipeline will be another major working area in the future.",
        "Examples are sentiment analysis for German, adding world knowledge about named entities (e.g. persons and events), identification of relations between entities.",
        "Finally, all these systems need to be evaluated not only in terms of f-score, precision and recall, but also in terms of usability for the political scientists.",
        "This also includes a detailed investigation of various political science concepts and if they can be detected automatically or if natural language processing can help the political scientists to detect their concepts semi-automatically.",
        "The definition of such evaluation is an open research topic in itself."
