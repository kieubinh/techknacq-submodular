        "Stories in the Dutch Folktale Database are annotated with uncontrolled, free-text, keywords.",

        "In this work we analyzed keywords in the context of the Dutch Folktale Database.",
        "In this database, on average 15 keywords have been assigned to a story, many of which are single keywords which appear literally or almost literally in the text itself.",
        "Keyword annotators show moderate to substantial agreement in extracting the same keywords for a story.",
        "We showed that a learning to rank method using features based on assignment ratio, tf.idf, part of speech and dispersion can be effectively used to extract and rank keyword candidates.",
        "We believe that this system can be used to suggest highly relevant keyword candidates to human annotators to speed up the archiving process.",
        "In our evaluation we aimed to reproduce the manual annotations, but it is unclear whether better performing systems are actually more helpful to the user.",
        "In an ad hoc retrieval scenario, in which the user issues a single query and reviews a list of retrieved documents, extracted keywords might be used to boost the early precision of the results.",
        "However, a user might not even notice a difference when a different keyword extraction system is used.",
        "Moreover, the more abstract keywords which do not appear in the text might be more important for the user experience.",
        "In future work we want to get insight in how keywords contribute to the end user experience.",
        "Ideally, the evaluation should directly measure how useful the various keywords are for accessing the collection.",
        "In this work we considered only extracting keywords from the text we want to annotate.",
        "Given the multilingual content of the database this is a limited approach: if the goal of assigning keywords is to obtain a normalized representation of the stories, this approach will require translation of either the source text (before extraction) or the extracted keywords.",
        "Even in the monolingual scenario, the extraction of keywords is limited in dealing with differences in style and word use.",
        "Writers may use different words or use words in a different way; ideally the representation based on keywords is a normalized representation which closes this semantic gap.",
        "In future work we will look into annotation with keywords from multilingual thesauri combined with free-text keywords extracted from the text itself.",
        "Finally, we want to look into classification of abstract themes and topics."
