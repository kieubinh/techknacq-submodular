        "Language documentation not only captures key linguistic data (both primary data and analytical facts) but also supports language revitalization efforts.",
        "It must include both primary data collection (as in Abney and Bird's (2010) universal corpus) and analytical work elucidating the linguistic structures of each language.",
        "As such, the outputs of documentary linguistics are dictionaries, descriptive (prose) grammars as well as transcribed and translated texts (Woodbury, 2003).",
        "Traditionally, these outputs were printed ar-tifacts, but the field of documentary linguistics has increasingly realized the benefits of producing digital artifacts as well (Nordhoff and Poggeman, 2012).",
        "Bender et al. (2012a) argue that the documentary value of electronic descriptive grammars can be significantly enhanced by pairing them with implemented (machine-readable) precision grammars and grammar-derived treebanks.",
        "However, the creation of such precision grammars is time consuming, and the cost of developing them must be brought down if they are to be effectively integrated into language documentation projects.",
        "In this work, we are interested in leveraging existing linguistic resources of two distinct types in order to facilitate the development of precision grammars for language documentation.",

        "These rich annotations include the segmentation of the source line into morphemes, the glossing of those individual morphemes, and the translation into a language of broader communication.",
        "The IGT format was developed to compactly display this information to other linguists.",
        "Here, we propose to repurpose such data in the automatic development of further resources.",
        "The second resource we will be working with is the LinGO Grammar Matrix (Bender et al., 2002; 2010), an open source repository of implemented linguistic analyses.",

        "The third of these (morphosyntactic features) concerns the type and range of grammaticized information that a language marks in its morphology and/or syntax.",
        "This includes person/number systems (e.g., is there an inclusive/exclusive distinction in non-singular first person forms?",
        "), the range of aspectual distinctions a language marks, and the range of cases (if any) in a language, inter alia.",
        "The answers to these questions in turn cause the system to provide relevant features that the user can reference in providing the more specific information elicited by the questionnaire ((iv) and (v) above), viz., the definition of both lexical types (e.g., first person dual exclusive pronouns) and morphological rules (e.g., nominative case marking on nouns).",
        "The information input by the user to the Grammar Matrix questionnaire is stored in a file called a ?choices file?.",
        "The choices file is used both in the dynamic definition of the html pages (so that the features available for lexical definitions depend on earlier choices) and as the input to the customization script that actually produces the grammar fragments to spec.",
        "The customization system distinguishes between choices files which are complete and consistent (and can be used to create working grammar fragments) and those which do not yet have answers to required questions or give answers which are inconsistent according to the underlying grammatical theory.",
        "The ultimate goal of the present project is to be able to automatically create complete and consistent choices files on the basis of IGT, and in fact to create complete and consistent choices files which take maximal advantage of the analyses stored in the Grammar Matrix customization system, answering not only the minimal set of questions required but in fact all which are relevant and possible to answer based on the information in the IGT.",
        "Creating such complete and consistent choices files is a long-term project, with different ap-proches required for the different types of questions outlined in ?1.",
        "Bender et al. (2012b) take some initial steps towards answering the questions which define lexical rules.",
        "We envision answering the questions regarding morphosyntactic features through an analysis of the grams that appear on the gloss line, with reference to the GOLD ontology (Farrar and Langendoen, 2003).",
        "The implementation of such systems in such a way that they are robust to potentially noisy data will undoubtedly be non-trivial.",
        "The contribution of this paper is the development of systems to handle one example each of the questions of types (i) and (ii), namely detecting major constituent word order and the underlying case system.",
        "For the first, we build directly on the work of Lewis and Xia (2008) (see ?2.2).",
        "Our experiment can be viewed as an attempt to reproduce their results in the context of the specific view of word order possibilities developed in the Grammar Matrix.",
        "The second question (that of case systems) is in some ways more subtle, requiring not only analysis of IGT instances in isolation and aggregation of the results, but also identification of particular kinds of IGT instances and comparison across them."

        "The better performance of GRAM is expected, given the small size and generally Leipzig-compliant glossing of our data sets.",
        "In future work, we plan to incorporate data from ODIN, which is likely less consistently annotated but more voluminous, and we expect SAO to be more robust than GRAM to this kind of data.",
        "We find that GRAM is sometimes able to do well when RiPLes gives alignment errors.",
        "For example, Old Japanese is a NOM-ACC language, but the case-marking grams (associated to postpositions) are not aligned to the NP arguments, so SAO is not able to judge their distribution.",
        "On the other hand, SAO prevails when non-standard grams are used, such as the NOM-ACC language Hupdeh, which is annotated with SUBJ and OBJ grams.",

        "Our initial results are promising, but also show remaining room for improvement.",
        "Error analysis suggests two main directions to pursue: Overcoming testsuite bias In both the word order and case system tasks, we see the effect of testsuite bias on our system results.",
        "The testsuites for freer word order languages can be artificially dominated by a particular word order that the testsuite author found convenient.",
        "Further, the restricted vocabulary used in testsuites, combined",
        "with a general preference for animates as subjects, leads to stems and certain grams potentially being misidentified as case markers.",
        "We believe that these aspects of testsuite bias are not typical of our true target input data, viz., the larger collections of IGT created by field projects.",
        "On the other hand, there may be other aspects of testsuites which are simplifying the problem and to which our current methods are over-fitted.",
        "To address these issues, we intend to look to larger datasets in future work, both IGT collections from field projects and IGT from ODIN.",
        "For the field projects, we will need to construct choices files.",
        "For ODIN, we can search for data from the languages we already have choices files for.",
        "As we move from testsuites to test corpora (e.g., narratives collected in documentary linguistics projects), we expect to find different distributions of word order types.",
        "Our current methodology for extracting word order is based on idealized locations in our word order space for each strict word order type.",
        "Working with naturally occurring corpora it should be possible to gain a more empirically based understanding of the relationship between underlying word order and sentence type distributions.",
        "It will be particularly interesting to see how stable these relationships are across languages with the same underlying word order type but from different language families and/or with differences in other typological characteristics.",
        "Better handling of unaligned words The other main source of error is words that remain unaligned in the projected syntactic structure and thus only loosely incorporated into the syntax trees.",
        "This includes items like case marking adpo-sitions in Japanese, which are unaligned because there is no corresponding word in English, and auxiliaries in Welsh, which are unaligned when the English translation doesn't happen to use an auxiliary.",
        "In the former case, our SAO method for case system extraction doesn't include the case grams in the set of grams for each NP.",
        "In the latter, the word order inference system is unable to pick up on the VSO order represented as Aux+S+[VP].",
        "Simply fixing the attachment of the auxiliaries will not be enough in this case, as the word order inference algorithm will need to be extended to handle auxiliaries, but fixing the alignment is the first step.",
        "Alignment problems are also the main reason our initial attempts to extract information about the order of determiners and nouns haven't yet been able to beat the most-frequent-type baseline.",
        "Better handling of these unaligned words is a non-trivial task, and will require bringing in sources of knowledge other than the structure of the English translation.",
        "The information we have to leverage in this regard comes mainly from the gloss line and from general linguistic/typological knowledge which can be added to the algorithm.",
        "That is, there are types of grams which are canonically associated with verbal projections and types of grams canonically associated with nominal projections.",
        "When these grams occur on unaligned elements, we can hypothesize that the elements are auxiliaries and case-marking adpositions respectively.",
        "Further typological considerations will motivate heuristics for modifying tree structures based on these classifications.",
        "Other directions for future work include extending this methodology to other aspects of grammatical description, including additional high-level systems (e.g., argument optionality), discovering the range of morphosyntactic features active in a language, and describing and populating lexical types (e.g., common nouns with a particular gender).",
        "Once we are able to answer enough of the questionnaire that the customization system is able to output a grammar, interesting options for detailed evaluation will become available.",
        "In particular, we will be able to parse the IGT (including held-out examples) with the resulting grammar, and then compare the resulting semantic representations to those produced by parsing the English translations with tools that produce comparable semantic representations for English (using the English Resource Grammar (Flickinger, 2000))."
