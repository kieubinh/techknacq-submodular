        "By increasing the size of their training corpus with web-crawled parallel texts and additional Bible translations, they achieved 4.55 BLEU points.3 Although better, the overall quality of the SMT system is still very low.",
        "There are at least two other projects that started the implementation of MT systems for the same language pair, but in the opposite direction; the AVENUE project4 used elicited corpora to build an MT system Quechua-Spanish.",
        "Furthermore, the language pair Quechua-Spanish has recently been added to the open-source MT platform Aper-tium.",
