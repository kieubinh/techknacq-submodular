        "In our paper, we present a method that tries to overcome these problems in the case of English-Hungarian translation by applying reordering rules prior to the translation process and by creating morpheme-based and factored models.",
        "Although automatic evaluation scores do not reliably reflect the improvement in all cases, human evaluation of our systems shows that readability and accuracy of the translations were improved both by reordering and applying richer models."

        "This results in ill-formed structures, such as nominal morphosyntactic features landing on verbs and verbal morphosyntactic features landing on nouns etc., thus, although the translation might contain the relevant translations regarding both lemmas and morphological features, the final sentence will be an inconsistent mixture of them, making generation of the right word forms impossible.",
        "Due to word order variations in Hungarian, this situation turned out to be rather frequent, affecting 21% of our 1000 test sentences.",
        "In order to improve translations compromised by inconsistent mapping of lemmas and morphology, we introduced a postprocessing step extracting and restoring the proper positions of the morphological tags in the result of factored translations.",

        "Five annotators evaluated translations generated by each of the above described systems plus the reference translation in the corpus with regard to translation quality (considering both adequacy and fluency in a single quality ranking).",
        "The order of translations was randomized for each sentence and a balanced number of comparisons was performed for each system pair.",
        "The systems were ranked based on a score that was defined as the number of times the output of a system was deemed not worse than that of the other in pairwise comparisons divided by the number of pairwise comparisons.",

        "Of our models, the wre system had the highest BLEU score, however, human evaluation ranked that worse than any of the morpheme-based systems.",

        "Considering all the systems in the ranking procedure, it can be observed that the reference translation used also for measuring BLEU score does not always represent the best translation either according to our evaluators.",
        "It is worth noting though that there was a rather significant variance in the ranking of reference translations due to some evaluators ranking them much less favourably than others (75.29% vs. 92.98%)."
