        "This paper presents a hybrid approach to the enhancement of English to Arabic statistical machine translation quality.",

        "Arabic, as a morphologically rich language, is a highly flex-ional language, in that the same root can lead to various forms according to its context.",
        "Statistical machine translation (SMT) engines often show poor syntax processing especially when the language used is morphologically rich such as Arabic.",
        "In this paper, to overcome these shortcomings, we describe our hybrid approach which integrates knowledge of the Arabic language into statistical machine translation.",

        "In fact, most Arabic words are made up by the concatenation of certain morphemes together.",
        "An Arabic corpus will therefore have more surface forms than an English corpus of the same size.",
        "On the other hand, many Arabic words are hom-ographic: they have the same orthographic form, but they have not the same meaning.",
        "This property can reduce the size of the translation vocabulary and has an important implication for statistical modeling of the Arabic language.",
        "These factors affect the performance of English-Arabic Statistical Machine Translation (SMT).",
        "To overcome these weaknesses of SMT, we propose a hybrid approach that seeks to integrate the linguistic information and enrich the lexical and syntactic resources in the statistical machine translation.",
        "Arabic language translation has been widely studied recently.",
        "Most of the time, the rich morphology of Arabic language is seen as a serious problem that must be resolved to build up an efficient translation system.",
        "It has been proven that preprocessing Arabic data and integrating its morpho-syntactic features is useful to improve machine translation results.",
        "The use of similar techniques for English-to-Arabic SMT requires recombination of the target side into valid surface forms, which is not a trivial task.",
        "In this paper, we describe an initial set of experiments on English-to-Arabic machine translation: we apply a morphological segmentation step for Arabic words and we present our hybrid approach by identifying morpho-syntactic class of each segmented word to build up our statistical feature language model.",
        "We propose the scheme for recombining the segmented Arabic, and describe their effect on translation.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: section 2 gives a brief description of some related works using hybrid approach to Machine Translation to introduce morpho-syntactic features in a machine translation process.",
        "Section 3 describes the baseline system.",
        "Then, section 4 presents the used morphological analyzer MORPH2 for Arabic texts, able to recognize word composition and to provide more specific morphological information about it.",
        "Next, we give information about Arabic syntax and morphology in section 5; in the remainder of this section, we discuss the complexity of the Arabic morphology and the challenge of recombining the translated and segmented Arabic words in to their surface forms.",
        "The Statistical Feature Language Model (SFLM) is explained in section 6, when used it aims to integrate morpho-syntactic knowledge about word in the language model.",
        "We propose in section 7 a scheme for recombining the translated and segmented Arabic words in to their surface forms.",
        "Section 8 gives a short overview of the data and tools used to build up our SMT system and shows the experimental details of our system using SFLM and the morphological analyzer MORPH2.",
