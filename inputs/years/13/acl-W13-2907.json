        "In this paper, we set out to investigate the applicability and generalizability of readability models for real-world web texts.",
        "We started with building readability models using linear regression, on a 5-level readability corpus with a range of lexical and syntactic features (section 4).",
        "We applied the two best models thus obtained to several web datasets we compiled from websites targeting children and others designed for adults (section 5.1) and on the Top-100 results obtained using a standard web search engine (section 5.2).",
        "We observed that the models identified texts across a broad range of reading levels in the web corpora.",
        "Our pilot study of the reading levels of the search results confirmed that readability models could be useful as re-ranking or filtering parameters that prioritize relevant results which are at the right level for a given user.",
        "At the same time, we observed in both these experiments that the average reading level of general web articles is relatively high according to our models.",
        "Apart from result ranking, this also calls for the construction of efficient text simplification systems which pick up the difficult texts and attempt to simplify them to a given reading level.",
        "We then proceeded to investigate how well the features used to build these readability models generalize across different corpora.",
        "For this, we reused the corpora with articles for children and adult readers from prototypical websites (section 5.1.1) and built four binary classification models with all of the readability features (section 6).",
        "Each of the models achieved good classification accuracies, supporting that the broad feature set used generalizes well across corpora.",
        "Whether or not to use traditional readability features is somewhat difficult to answer since those formulae are often taken into account when writing materials, so high classification accuracy on such corpora may be superficial in that it is not necessarily indicative of the spectrum of texts found on the web (section 5.1).",
        "This also raises the more general question which features work best for which kind of dataset.",
        "A systematic exploration of the effect of the individual features along with the impact of document topic and genre on readability would be interesting and relevant to pursue in the future.",
        "In our future work, we also intend to explore further features for this task and improve our understanding of the correlations between the different features.",
        "Finally, we are considering reformulating readability assessment as ordinal regression or preference ranking."
