        "These methods measure word similarity based on patterns of occurrence in large corpora, following the intuition that similar words occur in similar contexts.",
        "More precisely, vector space models, the most widely used distributional models, represent words as high-dimensional vectors, where the dimensions represent (functions of) context features, such as co-occurring context words.",
        "The relatedness of two words is assessed by comparing their vector representations.",
        "The question of assessing meaning similarity above the word level within the distributional paradigm has received a lot of attention in recent years.",
        "A number of compositional frameworks have been proposed in the literature, each of these defining operations to combine word vectors into representations for phrases or even entire sentences.",
        "These range from simple but robust methods such as vector addition to more advanced methods, such as learning function words as tensors and composing constituents through inner product operations.",
        "Empirical evaluations in which alternative methods are tested in comparable settings are thus called for.",
        "This is complicated by the fact that the proposed compositional frameworks package together a number of choices that are conceptually distinct, but difficult to disentangle.",
        "Broadly, these concern (i) the input representations fed to composition; (ii) the composition operation proper; (iii) the method to estimate the parameters of the composition operation.",
        "For example, Mitchell and Lapata in their classic 2010 study propose a set of composition operations (multiplicative, additive, etc.",
        "), but they also experiment with two different kinds of input representations (vectors recording co-occurrence with words vs. distributions over latent topics) and use supervised training via a grid search over parameter settings to estimate their models.",
        "Guevara (2010), to give just one further example, is not only proposing a different composition method with respect to Mitchell and Lapata, but he is also adopting different input vectors (word co-occurrences compressed via SVD) and an unsupervised estimation method based on minimizing the distance of composed vectors to their equivalents directly extracted from the source corpus.",
        "Blacoe and Lapata (2012) have recently highlighted the importance of teasing apart the different aspects of a composition framework, presenting an evaluation in which different input vector representations are crossed with different composition methods.",
        "However, two out of three composition methods they evaluate are parameter-free, so that they can sidestep the issue of fixing the parameter estimation method.",
        "In this work, we evaluate all composition methods we know of, excluding a few that lag be",
        "hind the state of the art or are special cases of those we consider, while keeping the estimation method constant.",
        "This evaluation is made possible by our extension to all target composition models of the corpus-extracted phrase approximation method originally proposed in ad-hoc settings by Baroni and Zamparelli (2010) and Guevara (2010).",
        "For the models for which it is feasible, we compare the phrase approximation approach to supervised estimation with crossvalidation, and show that phrase approximation is competitive, thus confirming that we are not comparing models under poor training conditions.",
        "Our tests are conducted over three tasks that involve different syntactic constructions and evaluation setups.",
        "Finally, we consider a range of parameter settings for the input vector representations, to insure that our results are not too brittle or parameter-dependent.1"

        "We focus here on compositional DSMs (cDSMs).",
        "After discussing some options pertaining to the input vectors, we review all the composition operations we are aware of (excluding only the tensor-product-based models shown by Mitchell and Lapata (2010) to be much worse than simpler models),2 and then methods to estimate their parameters.",

        "Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh (2011a; 2011b) and Kartsaklis et al. (2012) propose estimation techniques for the tensors in the functional model of Coecke et al. (2010).",

        "mensions record the syntactic link between targets and collocates (Erk and Pado?, 2008; Thater et al., 2010), and most recently vectors based on neural language models (Socher et al., 2011; Socher et al., 2012).",
        "Blacoe and Lapata (2012) compared the three representations on phrase similarity and paraphrase detection, concluding that ?simple is best?, that is, the bag-of-words approach performs at least as good or better than either syntax-based or neural representations across the board.",
        "Here, we take their message home and we focus on bag-of-words representations, exploring the impact of various parameters within this approach.",
        "Most frameworks assume that word vectors constitute rigid inputs fixed before composition, often using a separate word-similarity task independent of composition.",
        "The only exception is Socher et al. (2012), where the values in the input vectors are re-estimated during composition parameter optimization.",
        "Our reimplementation of their method assumes rigid input vectors instead.",

        "before recombining (formula in Table 1).",
        "Mitchell and Lapata also propose a simple multiplicative model in which the output components are obtained by component-wise multiplication of the corresponding input components.",
        "We introduce here its natural weighted extension (Mult), that takes w1 and w2 powers of the components before multiplying, such that each phrase component pi is given by: pi = u",
        "Guevara (2010) and Zanzotto et al. (2010) explore a full form of the additive model (Fulladd), where the two vectors entering a composition process are pre-multiplied by weight matrices before being added, so that each output component is a weighted sum of all input components: ~p = W1~u + W2~v.",
        "Baroni and Zamparelli (2010) and Coecke et al.",
        "(2010), taking inspiration from formal semantics, characterize composition as function application.",
        "For example, Baroni and Zamparelli model adjective-noun phrases by treating the adjective as a function from nouns onto (modified) nouns.",
        "Given that linear functions can be expressed by matrices and their application by matrix-by-vector multiplication, a functor (such as the adjective) is represented by a matrix Au to be composed with the argument vector ~v (e.g., the noun) by multiplication, returning the lexical function (Lexfunc) representation of the phrase: ~p = Au~v.",
        "The method proposed by Socher et al. (2012) (see Socher et al. (2011) for an earlier proposal from the same team) can be seen as a combination and non-linear extension of Fulladd and Lexfunc (that we thus call Fulllex) in which both phrase elements act as functors (matrices) and arguments (vectors).",
        "Given input terms u and v represented by (~u,Au) and (~v,Av), respectively, their composition vector is obtained by applying first a linear transformation and then the hyperbolic tangent function to the concatenation of the products Au~v and Av~u (see Table 1 for the equation).",
        "Socher and colleagues also present a way to construct matrix representations for specific phrases, needed to scale this composition method to larger constituents.",
        "We ignore it here since we focus on the two-word case.",
        "Estimating composition parameters If we have manually labeled example data for a target task, we can use supervised machine learning to optimize parameters.",
        "Mitchell and Lapata (2008; 2010), since their models have just a few parameters to optimize, use a direct grid search for the parameter setting that performs best on the training data.",
        "Socher et al. (2012) train their models using multinomial softmax classifiers.",
        "If our goal is to develop a cDSM optimized for a specific task, supervised methods are undoubtedly the most promising approach.",
        "However, every time we face a new task, parameters must be re-estimated from scratch, which goes against the idea of distributional semantics as a general similarity resource (Baroni and Lenci, 2010).",
        "Moreover, supervised methods are highly composition-model-dependent, and for models such as Fulladd and Lexfunc we are not aware of proposals about how to estimate them in a supervised manner.",
        "Socher et al. (2011) propose an autoencoding strategy.",
        "Given a decomposition function that reconstructs the constituent vectors from a phrase vector (e.g., it regenerates green and jacket vectors from the composed green jacket vector), the composition parameters minimize the distance between the original and reconstructed input vectors.",
        "This method does not require hand-labeled training data, but it is restricted to cDSMs for which an appropriate decomposition function can be defined, and even in this case the learning problem might lack a closed-form solution.",
        "Guevara (2010) and Baroni and Zamparelli (2010) optimize parameters using examples of how the output vectors should look like that are directly extracted from the corpus.",
        "To learn, say, a Lexfunc matrix representing the adjective green, we extract from the corpus example vectors of ?N, green N?",

        ".",
        ").",
        "We then use least-squares methods to find weights for the green matrix that minimize the distance between the green N vectors generated by the model given the input N and the corresponding corpus-observed phrase vectors.",
        "This is a very general approach, it does not require hand-labeled data, and it has the nice property that corpus-harvested phrase vectors provide direct evidence of the polysemous behaviour of functors (the green jacket vs. politician contexts, for example, will be very different).",
        "In the next section, we extend the corpus-extracted phrase approximation method to all cDSMs described above, with closed-form solutions for all but the Fulllex model, for which we propose a rapidly converging iterative estimation method."

        "In seven out of nine comparisons of this unsupervised technique with fully supervised crossvalidation (3 ?simple?",
        "models ?Add, Dil and Mult?",
        "times 3 test sets), there was no significant difference between the two estimation methods.10 Supervised estimation outperformed the corpus-phrase-based method only for Dil on the intransitive sentence and AN benchmarks, but crossvalidated Dil was outperformed by at least one phrase-estimated simple model on both benchmarks.",
        "The rightmost boxes in the panels of Figure 2 depict the performance distribution for using phrase vectors directly extracted from the corpus to tackle the various tasks.",
        "This non-compositional approach outperforms all compositional methods in two tasks over three, and it is one of the best approaches in the third, although 10Significance assessed through Tukey Honestly Significant Difference tests (Abdi and Williams, 2010), ?",
        "= 0.05. in all cases even its top scores are far from the theoretical ceiling.",
        "Still, performance is impressive, especially in light of the fact that the non-compositional approach suffers of serious data-sparseness problems.",
        "Performance on the intransitive task is above state-of-the-art despite the fact that for almost half of the cases one test phrase is not in the corpus, resulting in 0 vectors and consequently 0 similarity pairs.",
        "The other benchmarks have better corpus-phrase coverage (nearly perfect AN coverage; for DPs, about 90% correct phrase responses are in the corpus), but many target phrases occur only rarely, leading to unreliable distributional vectors.",
        "We interpret these results as a goodmotivation for corpus-phrase-based estimation.",
        "On the one hand they show how good these vectors are, and thus that they are sensible targets of learning.",
        "On the other hand, they do not suffice, since natural language is infinitely productive and thus no corpus can provide full phrase coverage, justifying the whole compositional enterprise.",
        "The other boxes in Figure 2 report the performance of the composition methods trained by corpus phrase approximation.",
        "Nearly all models are significantly above chance in all tasks, except for Fulladd on intransitive sentences.",
        "To put AN median ranks into perspective, consider that a median rank as high as 8,300 has near-0 probability to occur by chance.",
        "For DP accuracy, random guessing gets 0.17% accuracy.",
        "Lexfunc emerges consistently as the best model.",
        "On intransitive constructions, it significantly outperforms all other models except Mult, but the difference approaches significance even with respect to the latter (p = 0.071).",
        "On this task, Lexfunc's median correlation (0.26) is nearly equivalent to the best correlation across a wide range of parameters reported by Erk and Pado?",
        "(2008) (0.27).",
        "In the AN task, Lexfunc significantly outperforms Fulllex and Dil and, visually, its distribution is slightly more skewed towards lower (better) ranks than any other model.",
        "In the DP task, Lexfunc significantly outperforms Add and Mult and, visually, most of its distribution lies above that of the other models.",
        "Most importantly, Lexfunc is the only model that is consistent across the three tasks, with all other models displaying instead a brittle performance pattern.11 Still, the top-performance range of all models 11No systematic trend emerged pertaining to the input vector parameters (SVD vs. NMF and retained dimension num",
        "input vector settings (6 datapoints for Mult, 12 for all other models).",
        "For intransitive sentences, figure of merit is Spearman correlation, for ANs median rank of correct paraphrase, and for DPs correct response accuracy.",
        "The boxplots display the distribution median as a thick horizontal line within a box extending from first to third quartile.",
        "Whiskers cover 1.5 of interquartile range in each direction from the box, and extreme outliers outside this extended range are plotted as circles.",
        "on the three tasks is underwhelming, and none of them succeeds in exploiting compositionality to do significantly better than using whatever phrase vectors can be extracted from the corpus directly.",
        "Clearly, much work is still needed to develop truly successful cDSMs.",
        "The AN results might look particularly worrying, considering that even the top (lowest) median ranks are above 100.",
        "A qualitative analysis, however, suggests that the actual performance is not as bad as the numerical scores suggest, since often the nearest neighbours of the ANs to be paraphrased are nouns that are as strongly related to the ANs as the gold standard response (although not necessarily proper paraphrases).",
        "For example, the gold response to colorimetric analysis is colorimetry, whereas the Lexfunc (NMF, 300 dimensions) nearest neighbour is chromatography; the gold response to heavy particle is baryon, whereas Lexfunc proposes muon; for melodic phrase the gold is tune and Lexfunc has appoggiatura; for indoor garden, the gold is hothouse but Lexfunc proposes glasshouse (followed by the more sophisticated orangery!",
        "), and so on and so forth."

        "We extended the unsupervised corpus-extracted phrase approximation method of Guevara (2010) and Baroni and Zamparelli (2010) to estimate all known state-of-the-art cDSMs, using closed-form solutions or simple iterative procedures in all cases.",
        "Equipped with a general estimation approach, we thoroughly evaluated the cDSMs in a comparable setting.",
        "The linguistically motivated Lexfunc model of Baroni and Zamparelli (2010) and Coecke et al. (2010) was the winner across three composition tasks, also outperforming the more complex Fulllex model, our reimplementation of Socher et al's (2012) composition method (of course, the composition method is only one aspect of Socher et al's architecture).",
        "All other composition methods behaved inconsistently.",
        "In the near future, we want to focus on improving estimation itself.",
        "In particular, we want to explore ways to automatically select good phrase examples for training, beyond simple frequency thresholds.",
        "We tested composition methods on two-word phrase benchmarks.",
        "Another natural next step is to apply the composition rules recursively, to obtain representations of larger chunks, up to full sentences, coming, in this way, nearer to the ultimate goal of compositional distributional semantics."
