        "We develop a recursive neural network (RNN) to extract answers to arbitrary natural language questions from supporting sentences, by training on a crowdsourced data set (to be released upon presentation).",
        "The RNN defines feature representations at every node of the parse trees of questions and supporting sentences, when applied recursively, starting with token vectors from a neural probabilistic language model.",
        "In contrast to prior work, we fix neither the types of the questions nor the forms of the answers; the system classifies tokens to match a sub-string chosen by the question's author.",
        "Our classifier decides to follow each parse tree node of a support sentence or not, by classifying its RNN embedding together with those of its siblings and the root node of the question, until reaching the tokens it selects as the answer.",
        "A novel co-training task for the RNN, on subtree recognition, boosts performance, along with a scheme to consistently handle words that are not well-represented in the language model.",

        "The goal of this paper is to learn the syntax used to answer arbitrary natural language questions.",
        "If the kinds of questions were fixed but the supporting sentences were open, this would be a kind of relation extraction or slot-filling.",
        "If the questions were open but the supporting information was encoded in a database, this would be a kind of semantic parsing.",
        "In spite of many evaluation sets, no suitable data set for learning to answer questions has existed before.",
        "Data sets such as TREC (Dang et al., 2008) do not identify supporting sentences or even answers unless a competing system submitted an answer and a human verified it.",
        "Exceeding the capabilities of current systems is difficult by training on such labels; any newly discovered answer is penalized as wrong.",
        "The Jeopardy Archive (Schmidt, 2013) offers more than 200,000 answer/question pairs, but no pointers to information that supports the solutions.",
        "Believing that it is impossible to learn to answer questions, QA systems in TREC tended to measure syntactic similarity between question and candidate answer, or to map the question into an enumerated set of possible question types.",
        "For the predetermined question types, learning could be achieved, not from the QA data itself, but from pattern bootstrapping (Brin, 1998) or distant supervision against an ontology like Freebase (Mintz et al., 2009).",
        "These techniques lose precision; Riedel et al. (2010) found the distant supervision assumption was violated on 31% of examples aligning Freebase relations to text from The New York Times.",
        "We introduce a new, crowdsourced dataset, TurkQA, to enable question answering to be learned.",
        "TurkQA consists of single sentences, each with several crowdsourced questions.",
        "The answer to each question is given as a substring of the supporting sentence.",
        "For example, James Hervey (February 26, 1714 - December 25, 1758), English divine, was born at Hardingstone, near Northampton, and was educated at the grammar school of Northampton, and at Lincoln College, Oxford.",
        "could have questions like ?Where did James Hervey attend school as a boy??",
        "with answers like ?the grammar school of Northampton.?",
        "Our approach has yielded almost 40,000 such questions, and easily scales to many more.",
        "Since the sentence containing the answer has already been located, the machine's output can be judged without worrying about missing labels elsewhere in the corpus.",
        "Token-level ground truth forces the classifier to isolate the relevant information.",
        "To meet this challenge, we develop a classifier that recursively classifies nodes of the parse tree of a supporting sentence.",
        "The positively classified nodes are followed down the tree, and any positively classified terminal nodes become the tokens in the answer.",
        "Feature representations are dense vectors in a continuous feature space; for the terminal nodes, they are the word vectors in a neural probabilistic language model (like (Bengio and Ducharme, 2001)), and for interior nodes, they are derived from children by recursive application of an autoencoder.",
        "The contributions of this paper are: a data set for learning to answer free-form questions; a top-down supervised method using continuous word features in parse trees to find the answer; and a co-training task for training a recursive neural network that preserves deep structural information."

        "Restricting the forms of the questions, Poon and Domingos (2009) present a question-answering system for simple questions about biomedical text, by unsupervised semantic parsing (USP), using Markov logic.",

        "Without extended embeddings to differentiate unknown words, F1 is only .305 (66.8% precision, 19.7% recall).",
        "We are encouraged that increasing the amount of data contributes 50% to the F1 score (from only F1=.236 training on 1,333 questions), as it suggests that the power of our algorithms is not saturated while picking up the simplest features.",
