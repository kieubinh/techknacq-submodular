        "While most current approaches to machine translation concentrate on single sentences, there is emerging interest in phenomena that go beyond a single sentence and pertain to the whole text being translated.",
        "For example, Wong and Kit (2012) demonstrated that repetition of content words is a predictor of translation quality, with poorer translations failing to repeat words appropriately.",
        "Gong et al. (2011) and Tiedemann (2010) present caching of translations from earlier sections of a document to facilitate the translation of its later sections.",
        "In scholarship that deals with properties of human translation of literary texts, translation is often rendered as a process that tends to deform the original, and a number of particular aspects of deformation have been identified.",
        "Specifically, Berman (2000) discusses the problem of quantitative impoverishment thus: This refers to a lexical loss.",
        "Every work in prose presents a certain proliferation of signifiers and signifying chains.",
        "Great novelist prose is 'abundant.'",
        "These signifiers can be described as unfixed, especially as a signified may have a multiplicity of signifiers.",
        "For the signified visage (face) Arlt employs semblante, rosto and cara without justifying a particular choice in a particular sentence.",
        "The essential thing is that visage is marked as an important reality in his work by the use of three signifiers.",
        "The translation that does not respect this multiplicity renders the 'visage'",
        "of an unrecognizable work.",
        "There is a loss, then, since the translation contains fewer signifiers than the original.",
        "'1 While Berman's remarks refer to literary translation, recent work demonstrates its relevance for machine translation, showing that MT systems tend to under-use linguistic devices that are commonly used for repeated reference, such as super-ordinates or meronyms, although the pattern with synonyms and near-synonyms was not clear cut (Wong and Kit, 2012).",
        "Studying a complementary phenomenon of translation of same-lemma lexical items in the source document into a target language, Carpuat and Simard (2012) found that when MT systems produce different target language translations, they are stylistically, syntactically, or semantically inadequate in most cases",
        "(see upper panel of Table 5 therein), that is, diversifying the signifiers appropriately is a challenging task.",
        "For recent work on biasing SMT systems towards consistent translations of repeated words, see Ture et al. (2012) and Xiao et al. (2011).",
        "Moving beyond single signifieds, or concepts, Berman faults translations for 'the destruction of underlying networks of signification', whereby groups of related words are translated without preserving the relatedness in the target language.",
        "While these might be unavoidable in any translation, we show below that machine translation specifically indeed suffers from such a loss (section 3) and that machine translation suffers from it more than the human translations (section 4)."
