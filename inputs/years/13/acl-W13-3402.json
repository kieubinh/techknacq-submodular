        "The authors of most problems either constructed phrases or sentences on their own, or (much less commonly) used some real texts (e.g. excerpts from ancient manuscripts).",
        "Now that text corpora become widespread, they offer new possiblities for problem composing.",
        "This paper gives examples of such problems offered to high school students in Russia at recent linguistic olympiads.",
        "We comment on the ways such new problems are solved and show how the data obtained from text corpora and linguistic problems based thereon could be used for teaching linguistics to high school students.",
        "We deliberately include some of the original Russian versions of the problems alongside with their English translations (made specially for this paper and never published before), so that (1) those familiar with the Russian language could use the problems for training, and (2) issues of linguistic problem translation could be illustrated, too: translations of linguistic problems are not always equivalent to the originals (cf. Derzhanski et al. 2004)."

        "Unfortunately, many sentences present in the corpus are rather large and sometimes even clumsy.",
        "If long sentences are used to illustrate the usage of just one word, there will inevitably be a lot of irrelevant information (cf. #1, #2, #3; each of the long sentences is intended to illustrate the behavior of a single word).",
        "On the other hand, the solvers might enjoy reading long real-life sentences instead of artificial examples.",
        "Another issue that makes composing and using corpus-based problems difficult is the philosophy underlying such problems.",
        "In a typical problem that contains artificial data all phenomena must be explained by the solver.",
        "There is no place for unexplained variation.",
        "However, problems on corpus linguistics require statistical manner of thinking, rather than strictly deterministic conclusions.",
        "For example, problem #5 illustrates tendencies, some of which are more solid than the others.",
        "However, less frequent names do exist, which might baffle a solver who is used to explaining everything within a linguistics problem.",
        "In problem #4, the word ????",
        "which uses the old spelling did not vanish completely after the spelling reform of 1918.",
        "There is some noise at the bottom of the graph, and the solver has to understand that it is not necessary to account for this noise in order to solve the problem.",
        "The authors of problems on corpus linguistics should also be aware that the methodology they demonstrate is not always sound.",
        "For instance, in problem #6 Google hit counts are used in spite of the fact that is has been shown many times that they cannot be trusted (cf. Kilgarriff 2007).",
        "Ideally, a problem on computational linguistics should be accompanied by an afterword explaining the drawbacks of the methods it uses.",
        "Otherwise it might be tempting for students to get a simplistic notion of corpus linguistics and its methodology."

        "The corpus is a valuable data source not only for linguistic studies, but also for composing linguistic problems.",
        "Corpus linguistics problems are useful to introduce the study of variation and the basics of statistical thinking in linguistics.",
        "However, they also have certain drawbacks, namely their length and unexplained variation within the data (which can however sometimes be an advantage bringing the problem closer to the real life).",
        "The main advantage of corpus-based problems is that real data are used, which can be verified and even more thoroughly studied by the student.",
        "Moreover, through such problems the students become acquainted with corpus linguistics as a research field that is rapidly gaining importance."
