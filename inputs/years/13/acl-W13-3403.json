        "In an LO, every problem set is self-contained, so no prior experience in linguistics is necessary to compete.",
        "In fact, LO contests are fun and rewarding for exactly this reason: by the end of the contest, contestants are managing to read hieroglyphics, conjugate verbs in Swahili, and perform other amazing feats.",
        "Furthermore, they have accomplished this solely through their own analytical abilities and linguistic intuition.",
        "Based on our experience going into high schools and presenting our material, this ?linguistic?",
        "way of thinking about languages almost always comes as a novel surprise to students.",
        "They largely think about languages as collections of known facts that you learn in classes and from books, not something that you can dive into and figure out for yourself.",
        "This is a hands-on antidote to the common public misconception that linguists are fundamentally polyglots, rather than language scientists, and students come out of the experience having realized that linguistics is a very different field (and hopefully a more compelling one) than they had assumed it to be."

        "Thus far, NACLO's computational puzzles have reached at least 6,000 students at more than 150 testing sites7 in the U.S. and Canada, as well as at least 10,000 students in the three other English-language countries that share LO puzzles with NACLO.",
