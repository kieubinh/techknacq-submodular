        "Lingolympiaden aims to reach secondary school students that are interested in languages and linguistics and encourage them to become interested in studying social sciences, especially linguistics, at university.",
        "It has become apparent that students who are interested in the other olympiads and students that are very enthusiastic about natural sciences and programming seem to find the contest even if there has been little effort to reach them.",
        "It is much harder to reach secondary school students enrolled in programmes of social sciences and humanities as they are generally less used to there being extra curricular activities for them to be involved in.",
        "That being said, Lingolympiaden is of course open to all students (including students of non-theoretical programmes), students from natural science or programming backgrounds are more than welcome - it is just that efforts are put where they seem to be needed (and wanted) the most.",
        "Lingolympiaden would also like to reach more students who come from families with little higher education, but as these students are less likely to choose theoretical secondary school programmes and also less likely to have passionate and driven teachers this has proved a very hard task indeed.",
        "The primary means of contact are teachers of languages at secondary schools.",
        "In 2011 the Swedish government initiated a new secondary school programme of humanities that includes a basic course in linguistics as well as more classes in modern languages.",
        "We can take no credit for this, however, Lingolympiaden has established a stable and good contact with the Swedish Language Teachers Association as well as with teachers involved in this new secondary school programme.",
        "This has been a very fruitful connection, not only in that the contest reaches the students but also because the teachers have benefited from this in their education.",
        "Lingolympiaden also provides teaching materials in form of slides for classes in general linguistics, an IPA tutorial and adapted versions of old problems from the contest.",
        "Teachers and students are also able to ask questions about linguistics over email and Lingolympiaden gives advice on literature and sites (WALS, Ethnologue, Universals Archive, MultiTree, Omniglot, LangDoc, UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger, The Linguistics Podcasts by LinguistChris, The Five Minute Linguist-podcast etc.)",
        "that are useful to the teachers in their education.",
        "In addition to this Lingolympiaden visits secondary schools, giving lectures in linguistics and holding workshops on Olympiad problems for a nominal fee.",
        "These services are much appreciated by the teachers and students.",
        "Maintaining an active and good relation with the teachers is crucial in recruiting contestants to Lingolympiaden as well as a perfect opportunity to provide our first and foremost goal, to increase the interest in linguistics among the secondary school students."

        "Lingolympiaden aims to include problems from computational linguistics, general linguistics (primarily grammatical typology), field linguistics, phonetics and psycho linguistics.",
        "The staff at the universities are encouraged to construct problems on their area of expertise.",
        "Since there are many Ph.D. students who work on language descriptions and linguistic typology at Swedish universities there have been many problems on minor languages such as Kuot of Papua New Guinea and interesting grammatical phenomena such as hodiernal tense.",
        "The problem set of the Swedish contest has featured adapted and translated problems from other olympiads and other sources (Speculative Grammarian for example), but as the staff at the universities improve with every year there are less and less of these external problems.",
        "The problem constructors are advised to take into consideration that the problems are to be solvable by secondary school students with no linguistic training, but at the same time the problems shouldn't be based on pure logic alone.",
        "This is a tricky balance and it is impossible to make sure that no-one has an unfair advantage.",
        "The problem set for the Swedish olympiad is dependent on who within the university staff has the time to spend construction and testing problems.",
        "While the attention is to cover all areas within linguistics it is rare that staff from all sections are able to contribute.",
        "This is not a problem that is unique to the Swedish contest, more international collaboration will hopefully improve this situation.",

        "When conducting workshops it isn't the aim to test the students but rather to discuss different approaches to the problem and encourage their interest.",
        "Here are some examples of the problems that have been used in workshops at secondary schools.",
        "Lingdoku by Trey Jones Lingdoku is an IPA version of the Japanese number game Sudoku.",
        "This is very useful type of problem since most students are already familiar with the premises of Sudoku, it gives them a nice introduction to the variables necessary to define consonants and it is great for illustrating different approaches of problem solving.",
        "Since students enrolled in the new humanities programme are required to learn IPA this problem is also much appreciated by teachers.",
        "Lingdoku focuses only on pulmonic consonants and two variables, manner and place.",
        "The adaptation used in Lingolympiadens workshop has 4*4 different symbols to place within the grid without repeating the same manner or place in the 4 2*2- squares or any row or column.",

        "It is quite illustrative of the kind of problems one might encounter and it is not solvable by only applying straightforward logic.",
        "The problem consists of two sets of words in two related languages with translations into Swedish in a scrambled order.",
        "There are also a few morphemes that are translated are given as related in the two languages but with no Swedish translation.",
        "The method of solving it involves applying several ways of comparing the languages, the students have to be able to identify that the words have developed differently in the two languages and that concepts like horizon, border, wall and beach share a certain semantic component (??boundary??).",
        "It serves as inspiration and proof to students that their knowledge, experience and general feel for language and linguistics is directly applicable to solving concrete linguistic problems.",
        "PSG Web Laboratory by Torbj?rn Lager The Linguistics department at Gothenburg University have developed a simple online tool for creating context-free phrase structure grammars and testing them out.",
        "It was developed as an aid in a course on generative grammar and CFGs but it has quickly spread to other departments.",
        "It is accessible through any web browser, no passwords necessary.",
        "The tool is very useful when one wants to illustrate the concepts of competence and performance as conceived by Chomsky, how syntactic trees can be applied and, if time permits, what CFGs are.",
        "This exercise does require a bit more effort as many students are unfamiliar with formal language, but it is quite easy to make it fun since the freedom in defining the lexicon is limitless - something that has proven to be quite amusing.",

        "He was supposed to meet him when they arrived, but since they were late due to a storm he has returned to his home.",
        "They have to locate him by deciphering what the natives are saying to them, i.e. the sentences from the the original problem.",
        "They do not receive all sentences at once, they get them in small batches along with other clues (in step 2 they learn that there is a volcano).",
        "This gives them smaller amount of text to process at the same time, which makes it look less overwhelming.",
