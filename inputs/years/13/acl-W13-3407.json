        "At high schools in the Czech Republic, linguistics is taught only marginally or not at all.",
        "Students talented in linguistics thus tend to focus their talent on other areas, not even knowing what linguistics is like.",
        "We have struggled to change the state of affairs, and provide an alternative to the state system in delivering linguistic education to high school students.",
        "Up until recently, we exposed the high school students to linguistics only through a correspondence seminar.",
        "By the term correspondence seminar, we mean a form of voluntary education where students and teachers exchange assignments and their solutions by postal correspondence (or more recently, via electronic communication in a similar way).",
        "This concept is described in more detail in Section 2.",
        "However, as IOL1 (International Linguistics Olympiad; Radev et al. (2008)) came to our attention, we learned that despite the strong Czech linguistic tradition (Vachek and Du?kov?, 1983), there was no contest organised to select the Czech team for IOL.",
        "Hence we started the Czech Linguistic Olympiad (C?LO)2 last year, and we have since observed some notable differences",
        "in the nature of the two formats, which we shall summarise in this paper.",
        "We will start by giving a brief overview of the history of correspondence seminars, including Pralinka, the seminar in linguistics.",
        "In fact, correspondence seminar is not a new concept.",
        "The oldest contest based on postal correspondence, to our knowledge, is the Hungarian High School Mathematics and Physics Journal.3 It dates back to as early as 1894, and with two interruptions, it survived up to the present.",
        "Thanks to the fact that it is translated into English, it is open to international audiences.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, most correspondence seminars are organised in the area of former Czechoslovakia.",
        "The Slovak seminars include KMS4 (mathematics), FKS5 (physics), and STROM6 (mathematics).",
        "The last mentioned one claims to have the longest tradition in the area of former Czechoslovakia, having been established in 1976.",
        "Correspondence seminars organised in the Czech Republic include MKS7 (mathematics; founded 1981), FYKOS8 (physics; 1986), and KSICHT9 (chemistry; 2002; cf. R?ezanka et al.",
        "(2012)).",
        "The seminars mentioned above have grown very popular ?",
        "they commonly have several hundred participants each year.",
        "Our correspondence seminar in linguistics is called Pralinka.10 It was founded in 2008 and has about 14 participants each year, this low number being one significant difference to olympiads.",
        "During the five years, over 100 linguistic problems",
        "have been created and published in Pralinka.",
        "The contents and workings of the correspondence seminar are explained in detail in the following section.",
        "In Section 3, we point out differences between the correspondence seminar and an olympiad.",
        "In Section 4, we show sample problems created for Pralinka, and conclude with plans for the future in Section 5."

        "We will present the concept of a correspondence seminar on the concrete example of Pralinka.",
        "In Pralinka, we publish four issues featuring various linguistics problems each year.",
        "Students are supposed to solve as many problems as they can, and they have about six weeks to send us their solutions.",
        "We mark and comment on the solutions before sending them back to the participants.",
        "In a few weeks?",
        "time, a new issue is put together from new problem specifications and authors?",
        "solutions to previous problems.",
        "The specifications of the individual problems are linked together with a story, partly to provide motivation for the problems, partly to make the booklet more attractive for the reader.",
        "The first issue is sent with other faculty propagation materials, including other correspondence seminars, in the printed form to high school teachers countrywide.",
        "This is the only occassion when Pralinka uses traditional post.",
        "Every issue is published on our web page as a PDF, and participants?",
        "solutions and their corrections are submitted to an integrated system again as document files.",
        "An appropriately formatted PDF of each issue is provided so that whoever is interested, can easily print out the booklet at their site.",
        "Apart from the system for collecting problem submissions and their corrections, another online interface of Pralinka is its Facebook page where every new issue is announced and participants can discuss with the organisers.",
        "An essential motivation for the participants are points we give them for their solutions.",
        "Seminars with a higher number of participants use the ranking of participants to select the ones eligible for the seminar summer school.",
        "Pralinka also has a short summer school each year, but we have no need to cut the number of its participants.",
        "Still, we reward the best ranking ones for their efforts with a prize.",
        "Problems we publish in Pralinka can be divided into three classes: single problems, thematic problems and running tasks.",
        "Single problems are one-off tasks that typically include little or no theory.",
        "They usually require the students to discover a pattern in the provided linguistic data, or expand on a given topic.",
        "Thematic problems form a completely different genre.",
        "Their constitutive feature is that they go deep into the topic.",
        "Every year, a different topic is chosen to be investigated by the students under the supervision of the organisers.",
        "Theory for the topic is extended in each issue of the seminar, and a very open formulation of a problem to solve is given.",
        "The problem specification in the next issue is largely determined by the students?",
        "contributions.",
        "Students are thus introduced to the selected branch of linguistics step by step, both theoretically and practically.",
        "Thematic problems in the history of Pralinka examined topics like meaning of words in context or verbal aspects and their use.",
        "Lastly, running tasks or series are similar to thematic problems in many respects.",
        "They are on a selected topic each year, and gradually build up the theory.",
        "In contrast to thematic problems, assignments in each instance of the running task are precisely specified and solvers?",
        "answers do not influence the future direction of the series.",
        "Some running tasks explore phenomena from different layers of linguistic description using an artificial language as the subject, others have the form of a textbook text split into chapters, providing exercises for each chapter.",
        "The latter kind covered topics such as language universals, Arabic (an introduction to the language) or semantics.",
        "An important feature of the correspondence seminar is the individual attitude to students and their solutions.",
        "Correcting solutions does not consist only of assigning the appropriate number of points.",
        "More important is the feedback in the form of advice and questions related to the contestant's own text."

      "heading": "3 Comparison to Olympiads",
      "text": [
        "We now turn to the comparison of a correspondence seminar and an olympiad as two alternative ways of promoting linguistics among gifted high school students.",
        "We will discuss the following aspects: time required for solving the problems, nature of the problems, attitude to linguistic knowledge, use of external information sources, and at",
        "tractiveness to students.",
        "Linguistic olympiads are generally one-time events whose participants are given just a few hours to solve a number of problems.",
        "They are thus motivated to quickly discover just as many features of the problem as needed to find answers for the questions posed.",
        "It is likely that solving such a problem involves just the short term memory, and the related ideas are much easier to forget.",
        "In contrast, participants of a correspondence seminar have lots of time to think each problem over, therefore, firstly, the problems need to provide enough food for thought, and secondly, this leads the solvers to internalise the ideas behind the problem much better.",
        "For typically large numbers of participants of olympiads, especially in school rounds, olympiads need to have a clear grading scheme, hence closed-ended questions are the best suited.",
        "In contrast, problems in a correspondence seminar can be (and, in Pralinka, they often are) open-ended.",
        "This again supports deeper thinking about the problem.",
        "The different composition of Pralinka versus C?LO in terms of problem types is quantified in Table 1.",
        "We counted problems from the 2010/2011 (the last school year before we launched C?LO) and 2012/2013 (this year; one issue could not yet be included) editions of Pralinka and this year's C?LO.",
        "We assessed for each problem whether:",
        "1. it is solved by applying the common pattern of establishing a segmentation of the linguistic data (e.g. words into morphemes, Chinese characters into two parts) and then aligning the corresponding segments (row ?seg+al?",
        "in the table); 2. theory is explained as part of the problem (?theory?",
        "); 3. an open-ended question is posed (?open?",
        ").",
        "Table 2 follows the same layout but lists counts of students that attempted to solve each problem.11 The numbers justify our claim that problems in Pralinka are more often open-ended than those in the olympiad.",
        "They also show that there is much more space for presenting theory as part of the problems in Pralinka, which we expand on in the following paragraph.",
        "Another fact illustrated by the numbers is that we adjusted Pralinka problems to be more similar to olympiad problems when C?LO was founded, in order to prepare Pralinka solvers for the olympiad.",
        "Lastly, the difference in the number of attempted solutions between Pralinka and C?LO is huge, as evident from Table 2.",
        "We try to explain this fact in the paragraphs below.",
        "Another important difference regards the amount of linguistic knowledge presented together with the problems and required to solve them.",
        "The olympiad is primarily concerned with testing the contestant's skills in analysing an unknown language, often their analytical thinking in general.",
        "On the other hand, the correspondence seminar puts stress on teaching not only skills, but also knowledge, in order to widen contestants?",
        "horizons.",
        "To this end, problems published in Pralinka often comprise two parts: a theoretical one and a practical one, the latter part helping the solver practise immediately what was expounded in the former part.",
        "The two formats differ also with respect to the approach to various external sources of knowledge.",
        "Olympiads strictly forbid using them, whereas in the correspondence seminar, their use is welcome.",
        "O.",
        "?teffl, a prominent Czech education specialist, claims that ?.",
        ".",
        ".",
        "the accessibility of information has dramatically changed.",
        "If I type ?coelenterate?",
        "into Google, what appears in a few seconds are BBC documentaries, pictures, explanations, curiosities, and I can search for context and links in this topic.",
        "?12 Situation is the same for linguistic knowledge.",
        "There is a vast amount of",
        "linguistic information accessible on the Internet.",
        "In Pralinka, even though we usually aim to create problems that cannot be simply solved by consulting Wikipedia or other sources, we are pleased to hear when our participants bother to use online resources, or even borrow a grammar book of a language in order to understand the topic more deeply, as provoking students to study on their own is one of our goals.",
        "Finally, it is remarkable how few students get involved in the correspondence seminar, compared to the olympiad.",
        "The olympiad started only last year and it already has an order of magnitude more participants.",
        "This can be attributed to a simple fact that general awareness of linguistics as an interesting discipline among Czech high school students is very poor compared to mathematics or physics.",
        "Students thus do not show active interest in linguistics, although they get involved once their teachers give them linguistic problems at school during the olympiad school round.",
        "We believe that participants of Pralinka are generally more interested in linguistics than participants of C?LO, and hence are more likely to en-roll in a linguistics study programme at the university and be successful in it.",
        "Unfortunately, data we could use to test this hypothesis is not collected yet, although currently there is an effort of the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics to quantify the effectivity of its propagation activities including Pralinka."
