        "Treebanks are now increasingly used as pedagogical tools (Crane et al., 2012), chiefly in two ways.",
        "On the one hand, in linguistics courses, students may use existing treebanks to perform quantitative analysis on syntactic patterns.",
        "On the other, in language courses, students may annotate syntactic structures to reinforce grammatical concepts, creating new treebanks.",
        "In this paper, we describe our experience in integrating these two processes into a research project in an undergraduate course, and discuss its benefits and challenges.",
        "The project formed part of a course entitled ?Language Information Technology?.",
        "With no previous training, students collectively annotated the dependency structures of a portion of the Three Hundred Tang Poems, a popular anthology of Classical Chinese poems.",
        "The instructor edited the annotations, compiled them into a dependency treebank, and made it available for search and visualization on a web-based interface.",
        "Then, in a research assignment, students tackled questions on Chinese poetry with this treebank, which they had created with their own hands.",
        "Combining the creation of a treebank with its use in a research assignment has many benefits.",
        "With respect to pedagogy, the assignment demonstrates to students the practical rationale for treebanks; the treebanking exercise familiarized students with the data and annotation scheme, helping them perform better on the assignment.",
        "With respect to longer-term effects, students perceive their own, tangible contribution to a field of scholarly research, in the form of linguistic annotations that are reusable by other scholars.",
        "The hands-on practice of a novel research methodology --- data-driven study in lin- guistics and literature --- should encourage them to apply it in their future fields of study.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 outlines previous use of treebanks in the classroom.",
        "Section 3 describes how our course was structured.",
        "Section 4 explains how students created the treebank, which formed the basis of the research assignment discussed in section 5.",

        "Many current systems support the use of linguistic corpora for teaching and learning.",
        "One of many examples, the Visual Interactive Syntax Learning (VISL) system allows students to search, view, construct and label parse trees (Bick, 2005).",
        "The GATE system similarly facilitates corpus annotation, but it can also perform a variety of NLP tasks including POS tagging and parsing (Bontcheva et al., 2002).",
        "These systems facilitate pedagogical use of treebanks in two main ways.",
        "First, students visualize parse trees and search for linguistic structures on existing treebanks.",
        "These functions",
        "support empirical and quantitative analysis of linguistic phenomena.",
        "Second, students also use their editing environment to create new dependency annotations on text, as exercises in learning a new language.",
        "The resulting treebank can then be made available for all scholars.",
        "The latter type of usage has been implemented in Classics courses at six American universities.",
        "Students made dependency annotations on a Latin or Greek text, which the instructor then reconciled.",
        "The results contributed to the Latin and Ancient Greek Dependency Treebanks that are being compiled at the Perseus Project.",
        "In a study on 13 students, who had received limited training, the inter-annotator accuracy averaged 54.5% (Bamman & Crane, 2010).",
        "Treebanking itself has also been taught in a course (Volk et al., 2005).",
        "Another notable case where students collectively created new linguistic resources has been reported at a graduate course in multilingual grammar engineering (Bender, 2007).",
        "Each student developed a grammar for automatic parsing of a new language.",
        "Over time, students?",
        "work was found to be effective in bringing feedback to the core grammar, and to facilitate empirical research on cross-linguistic comparisons.",
        "A significant novelty in our course design is that, after students create new annotations for a treebank, they share the data with the rest of the class, and apply the freshly compiled treebank for linguistic research.",
        "We now describe how these two processes were implemented."

        "While some had previously taken linguistics courses, none was familiar with dependency grammar or its annotation scheme.",
        "The course lasted for 13 weeks; weekly meetings consisted of a one-hour lecture and a two-hour tutorial or practicum.",
        "Roughly one half of this course was devoted to the treebanking project.",
        "In the first week, part-of-speech (POS) tagging was introduced, with English as the example language.",
        "During the practicum, students reviewed POS concepts with exercises and Stanford's online tagger1.",
        "In the second, dependency trees were introduced, again using examples in English.",
        "Lectures in the third and fourth weeks turned the attention to Chinese POS and dependency trees, using respectively the schemes defined at the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005) and Stanford (Chang et al., 2009).",
        "During the practicums, adaptations to these schemes for Classical Chinese (Lee, 2012; Lee & Kong, 2012) were presented.",
        "In the fifth week, the web interface for searching and visualizing treebanks, which would later be used for a research assignment (see section 5), was demonstrated.",
        "Also, students were assigned individual texts for POS tagging and dependency labeling (see section 4).",
        "The practicum was devoted to discussions on difficulties in annotation.",
        "The annotations were due two weeks later.",
        "After editing by the instructor, the treebank was posted on the aforementioned web interface, and the assignment was released.",
        "Overall, each student received 15 hours of class time in preparation for the treebanking project."

        "The most frequent pairs of confusion are among the tags VA (predicative adjectives), AD (adverbs), and JJ (attributive adjectives).",
