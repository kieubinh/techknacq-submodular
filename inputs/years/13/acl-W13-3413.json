        "It was first offered at Columbia University during the 2013 spring semester, and will be offered at other institutions starting in the fall semester.",
        "We describe the course's first successful run and its unique features: a class centered around a specific industrial technology; a large-scale class project which student teams can choose to participate in and which serves as the basis for an open source project that will continue to grow each time the course is offered; publishable papers, demos and start-up ideas; evidence that the course can be self-evaluating, which makes it potentially appropriate for an online setting; and a unique model where a large company trains instructors and contributes to creating educational material at no charge to qualifying institutions."

        "In 2007, IBM Research took on the grand challenge of building a computer system that can perform well enough on open-domain question answering to compete with champions at the game of Jeopardy!",
        "In 2011, the open-domain question answering system dubbed Watson beat the two highest ranked players in a two-game Jeopardy!",
        "match.",
        "To be successful at Jeopardy!, players must retain enormous amounts of information, must have strong language skills, must be able to understand precisely what is being asked, and must accurately determine the likelihood they know the right answer.",
        "Over a four year period, the team at IBM developed the Watson system that competed on Jeopardy!",
        "and the underlying DeepQA question answering technology (Ferrucci et al., 2010).",
        "Watson played many games of Jeopardy!",
        "against celebrated Jeopardy!",
        "champions and, in games televised in February 2011, won against the greatest players of all time, Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter.",
        "DeepQA has applications well beyond Jeopardy!, however.",
        "DeepQA is a software architecture for analyzing natural language content in both questions and knowledge sources.",
        "DeepQA discovers and evaluates potential answers and gathers and scores evidence for those answers in both unstructured sources, such as natural language documents, and structured sources such as relational databases and knowledge bases.",
        "Figure 1 presents a high-level view of the DeepQA architecture.",
        "DeepQA utilizes a massively parallel, component-based pipeline architecture (Ferrucci, 2012) which uses an extensible set of structured and unstructured content sources as well as a broad range of pluggable search and scoring components that allow integration of many different analytic techniques.",
        "Machine Learning techniques are used to learn the weights for each scoring component in order to combine them into a single final score.",
        "Watson components include a large variety of state of the art solutions originating in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), Information Retrieval (IR), Semantic Web and Cloud Computing.",
        "IBM is now aggressively investing in turning IBM Watson from a research prototype to an industry level highly adaptable system to be applied in dozens of business ap",
        "plications ranging from healthcare to finance (Ferrucci et al., 2012).",
        "Finding that particular combination of skills in the entry-level job market is hard: in many cases students have some notion of Machine Learning but are not strong in Natural Language Processing; in other cases they have background in Knowledge Management and some of the basics of Semantic Web, but lack an understanding of statistical models and Machine Learning.",
        "In most cases semantic integration is not a topic of interest, and so understanding sophisticated platforms like Apache UIMATM (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004) is a challenge.",
        "Learning how to develop the large scale infrastructure and technology needed for IBM Watson prepares students for the real-world challenges of large-scale natural language projects that are common in industry settings and which students have little experience with before graduation.",
        "Of course, IBM is interested in hiring entry-level students as a powerful way of scaling Watson.",
        "Therefore, it has resolved to start an educational program focused on these topics.",
        "Initially, tutorials were given at scientific conferences (NAACL, ISWC and WWW, among others), universities and summer schools.",
        "The great number of attendees (usually in the range of 50 to 150) and strongly positive feedback received from the students was a motivation to transform the didactic material collected so far into a full graduate-level course, which has been offered for the first time at Columbia University.",
        "The course (which is described in the rest of this paper) received very positive evaluations from the students and will be used as a template to be replicated by other partner universities in the following year.",
        "Our ultimate goal is to develop high quality didactic material for an educational curriculum that can be used by interested universities and professors all over the world."
