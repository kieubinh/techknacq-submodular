        "Databases of facts, such as Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008) or Open Information Extraction (Open IE) extractions, are useful for a range of NLP applications from semantic parsing to information extraction.",
        "However, as the domain of a database grows, it becomes increasingly impractical to collect completely, and increasingly unlikely that all the elements intended for the database are explicitly mentioned in the source corpus.",
        "In particular, common-sense facts are rarely explicitly mentioned, despite their abundance.",
        "It would be useful to infer the truth of such unseen facts rather than assuming them to be implicitly false.",
        "A growing body of work has focused on automatically extending large databases with a finite set of additional facts.",
        "In contrast, we propose a system to generate the (possibly infinite) completion of such a database, with a degree of confidence for each unseen fact.",
        "This task can be cast as querying whether an arbitrary element is a member of the database, with an informative degree of confidence.",
        "Since often the facts in these databases are devoid of context, we refine our notion of truth to reflect whether we would assume a fact to be true without evidence to the contrary.",
        "In this vein, we can further refine our task as determining whether an arbitrary fact is plausible ?",
        "true in the absence contradictory evidence.",
        "In addition to general applications of such large databases, our approach can further be integrated into systems which can make use of probabilistic membership.",
        "For example, certain machine translation errors could be fixed by determining that the target translation expresses an implausible fact.",
        "Similarly, the system can be used as a soft feature for semantic compatibility in coreference; e.g., the types of phenomena expressed in Hobbs?",
        "selectional constraints (Hobbs, 1978).",
        "Lastly, it is useful as a common-sense filter; we evaluate the system in this role by filtering implausible facts from Open IE extractions, and filtering incorrect responses for a question answering system.",
        "Our approach generalizes word similarity metrics to a notion of fact similarity, and judges the membership of an unseen fact based on the aggregate similarity between it and existing members of the database.",
        "For instance, if we have not seen the fact that philosophers are mortal1 but we know that Greeks are mortal, and that philosophers and Greeks are similar, we would like to infer that the fact is nonetheless plausible.",
        "We implement our approach on both a large open-domain database of facts extracted from the Open IE system ReVerb (Fader et al., 2011), and ConceptNet (Liu and Singh, 2004), a hand curated database of common sense facts."

        "We differ from these approaches in that we aim to provide an exhaustive completion of the database; we would like to respond to a query with either membership or lack of membership, rather than extending the set of elements which are members.",
        "Yao et al. (2012) and Riedel et al. (2013) present a similar task of predicting novel relations between Freebase entities by appealing to a large collection of Open IE extractions.",
        "Our work focuses on arguments which are not necessarily named entities, at the expense of leveraging less entity-specific information.",
        "Work in classical artificial intelligence has tackled the related task of loosening the closed world assumption and monotonicity of logical reasoning, allowing for modeling of unseen propositions.",
        "Reiter (1980) presents an approach to leveraging default propositions in the absence of contradictory evidence; McCarthy (1980) defines a means of overriding the truth of a proposition in abnormal cases.",
        "Perhaps most similar to this work is Pearl (1989), who proposes approaching non-monotonicity in a probabilistic framework, and in particular presents a framework for making inferences which are not strictly entailed but can be reasonably assumed.",

        "To adapt our system to the task, we first heuristically converted the question into a query fact using the subject and object Stanford Dependency labels (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008).",
        "If either the subject or object specifies a type (e.g., Which party does Bill Clinton belong to?",
        "), the score of the fact encoding this relationship (e.g., (Democrat, be, party)) is averaged with the main query.",
        "Next, answers with very little n-gram overlap between the justification and either the question or answer are filtered; this filters answers which may be correct, but were not properly justified.",

        "As we are evaluating our system as a single component not trained on the task, we understandably fall well under the top performing systems; however, our performance is nonetheless an indication that the system provides a valuable signal for the task."
