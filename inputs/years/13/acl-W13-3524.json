        "Identifying significant terms in a text corpus constitutes a core task in natural language processing.",
        "Fields of application are for example glossary extraction (Kozakov et al., 2004) or ontology learning (Navigli and Velardi, 2004).",
        "In this work, we particularly focus on the application scenario of aspect-based customer review mining (Hu and Liu, 2004; Dave et al., 2003).",
        "It is best described as a sentiment analysis task, where the goal is to summarize the opinions expressed in customer reviews.",
        "Typically, the problem is decomposed into three subtasks: 1) identify mentions of relevant product aspects, 2) identify sentiment expressions and determine their polarity, and 3) aggregate the sentiments for each aspect.",
        "In this paper, we only consider the first subtask, i.e., finding relevant product aspects in reviews.",
        "More precisely, we define the problem setting as follows: Input is a homogeneous collection of customer reviews, i.e., all reviews refer to a single product type (e.g., digital cameras or hotels).",
        "The goal is to automatically derive a lexicon of the most relevant aspects related to the product type.",
        "For example, given a set of hotel reviews, we want to determine aspects such as ?room size?, ?front desk staff?",
        "?sleep quality?, and so on.",
        "In general, product aspects may occur as nominal (e.g., ?image stabilization?",
        "), named (e.g., ?SteadyShot feature?",
        "), pronominal (e.g., ?it?",
        "), or implicit mentions (e.g., ?reduction of blurring from camera shake?).",
        "We explicitly restrict the task to finding nominal aspect mentions1.",
        "The contribution of this paper is to explicitly cast the problem setting as a terminology extraction (TE) task and to examine the utility of methods that have been proven beneficial in this context.",
        "Most related work does not consider this close relationship and rather presents ad-hoc approaches.",
        "Our main contributions are as follows: ?",
        "We experiment with varying term acquisition methods, propose a set of new term filtering approaches, and consider variant aggregation techniques typically applied in TE systems.",
        "?",
        "We compare the utility of different term relevance measures and experiment with combinations of these measures.",
        "?",
        "We propose and assess a new method that filters erroneous modifiers (adjectives) in term candidates.",
        "Our method exploits information obtained from pros/cons summaries of customer reviews.",
        "?",
        "Our best configuration improves over a state-of-the-art baseline by up to 7 percentage points.",
