        "Psycholinguistic studies have shown great interest in the learning of Mental State Verbs (MSVs), such as think and want, given the various cognitive and linguistic challenges in their acquisition.",
        "MSVs refer to an entity's inner states, such as thoughts and wishes, which the language learner must be able to perceive and conceptualize appropriately.",
        "Moreover, such verbs often appear in a Sentential Complement (SC) construction, which is complex for children because of the embedded clause.",
        "Despite some shared properties, MSVs are a heterogeneous group, with different types of verbs exhibiting different developmental patterns.",
        "Specifically, a wealth of research shows that children produce Desire verbs, such as want and wish, earlier than Belief verbs, such as think and know (Shatz et al., 1983; Bartsch and Wellman, 1995; Asplin, 2002; Perner et al., 2003; de Villiers, 2005; Papafragou et al., 2007; Pascual et al., 2008).",
        "Some explanations for this pattern posit that differences in the syntactic usages of Desire and Belief verbs underlie the observed developmental lag of the latter (de Villiers, 2005; Pas-cual et al., 2008).",
        "In particular, Desire verbs occur mostly with an infinitival SC (as in I want (her) to leave), while Belief verbs occur mostly with a finite SC (a full tensed embedded clause, as in I think (that) she left).",
        "Notably, infiniti-vals appear earlier than finite SCs in the speech of young children (Bloom et al., 1984, 1989).",
        "Others suggest that Desire verbs are conceptually simpler (Bartsch and Wellman, 1995) or pragmatically/communicatively more salient (Perner, 1988; Fodor, 1992; Perner et al., 2003).",
        "Proponents of the conceptual and pragmatic accounts argue that syntax alone cannot explain the delay in the acquisition of Belief verbs, because children use finite SCs with verbs of Communication (e.g., say) and Perception (e.g., see) long before they use them with Belief verbs (Bartsch and Wellman, 1995).",
        "We use a computational model of verb argument structure acquisition to shed light on the factors that might be responsible for the developmental gap between Desire and Belief verbs.",
        "Importantly, our model exhibits the observed pattern of learning Desire before Belief verbs, without having to encode any differences in difficulty between the two classes in terms of their syntactic or conceptual/pragmatic requirements.",
        "The behaviour of the model can thus be attributed to its probabilistic learning mechanisms in conjunction with the distributional properties of the input.",
        "In particular, we investigate how the model's learning mechanism interacts with the distributions of several classes of verbs ?",
        "including Belief, Desire, Perception, Communication, and Action ?",

        "For example, if the model is presented with a frame corresponding to a transitive utterance using a verb it has not observed before, such as She gor-ped the ball, the example cluster above would lead the model to predict that gorp has semantic event primitives in common with other Action verbs like eat, take, and get.",

        "Thus, while Desire and Belief verbs that typically occur with an SC-inf or SC-fin have a distinguishing feature, there is nothing in this representation that makes Desire verbs inherently easier to process.",

        "In particular, we assume that the learner is able to perceive and conceptualize the general semantic properties of different kinds of events (e.g., state and action), as well as those of the event participants (e.g., agent, experiencer, and theme).",

        "compared with Figure 2(a) for the SC-inf test frame.",
        "Since Action verbs do not occur in our data with SC-fin (see Table 2), their likelihood here comes from the misinterpretation of mental events (accompanied with SC-fin) as action.",
        "The initially high likelihoods of Communication and Perception verbs results from their high frequency of occurrence with SC-fin.",
        "Because at this stage Belief verbs are not always correctly associated with SC-fin due to the high probability of misinterpreting them as action, we see a lower likelihood of predicting Belief verbs.",
        "Eventually, the model produces more Belief responses than any other verb class, since Beliefs have the highest frequency of occurrence with the finite-SC syntax.",
        "To summarize, our results here confirm our hypothesis that the distributional properties of the verb classes with the finite and infinitival SC patterns, coupled with the learning mechanisms of the model, account for the observed developmental pattern of MSV acquisition in our model."

        "We use a computational model of verb argument structure learning to shed light on the factors that might underlie the earlier acquisition of Desire verbs (e.g., wish and want) than Belief verbs (e.g., think and know).",
        "Although this developmental gap has been noted by many researchers, there are at least two competing theories as to what might be the important factors: differences in the conceptual/pragmatic requirements (e.g., Fodor, 1992; Bartsch and Wellman, 1995; Perner et al., 2003), or differences in the syntactic properties (e.g., de Villiers, 2005; Pascual et al., 2008).",
        "Using a computational model, we suggest other factors that may play a role in an explanation of the observed gap, and should be taken into account in experimental studies on human subjects.",
        "First, we show that the model exhibits a similar pattern to children, in that it performs better at predicting Desire verbs compared to Belief verbs, given a novel verb paired with typical Desire or Belief syntax and semantics, respectively.",
        "This difference in performance suggests that the model forms a strong association between the desire semantics and the infinitival-SC syntax ?",
        "one that is formed earlier and is stronger than the association it forms between the belief semantics and the finite-SC syntax.",
        "Importantly, the replication of this behaviour in the model does not require an explicit encoding of conceptual/pragmatic differences between Desire and Belief verbs, nor of a difference between the two types of SC syntax (finite and infinitival) with respect to their ease of acquisition.",
        "Instead, we find that what is responsible for the model's behaviour is the distribution of the semantic verb classes (Desire, Belief, Perception, Communication, and Action) with the finite and infinitival SC syntactic patterns in the input.",
        "Children are also found to produce semantically-concrete verbs, such as Communication (e.g., say) and Perception verbs (e.g., see), with the finite SC before they produce (more abstract) Belief verbs with the same syntax.",
        "Psycholinguistic theories have different views on what this observation tells us about the delay in the acquisition of Belief verbs.",
        "For example, Bartsch and Wellman (1995) suggest that the earlier production of Communication verbs shows that even when children have learned the finite-SC syntax (and use it with more concrete verbs), they lack the required conceptual development to talk about the beliefs of others.",
        "Our results suggest a different take on these same findings: because Communication (and Perception) verbs also frequently appear with the finite-SC syntax in the input, the model learns a relatively strong association between each of these semantic classes and the finite SC.",
        "This in turn causes a delay in the formation of a sufficiently-strong association between the Belief verbs and that same syntax, compared with the association between the Desire verbs and the infinitival SC.",
        "de Villiers (2005) suggests that associating Communication verbs with the finite-SC syntax has a facilitating effect on the acquisition of Belief verbs.",
        "In our model, we observe a competition between Communication and Belief verbs, in terms of their association with the finite-SC syntax.",
        "To further explore the hypothesis of de Villiers (2005) will require expanding our model with enriched semantic representations that enable us to investigate the bootstrapping role of Communication verbs in the acquisition of Beliefs."
