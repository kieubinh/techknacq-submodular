        "Grammatical error correction is the shared task of the Seventeenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning in 2013 (CoNLL2013).",
        "In this task, given an English essay written by a learner of English as a second language, the goal is to detect and correct the grammatical errors present in the essay, and return the corrected essay.",
        "This task has attracted much recent research interest, with two shared tasks Helping Our Own (HOO) 2011 and 2012 organized in the past two years (Dale and Kilgarriff, 2011; Dale et al., 2012).",
        "In contrast to previous CoNLL shared tasks which focused on particular subtasks of natural language processing, such as named entity recognition, semantic role labeling, dependency parsing, or coreference resolution, grammatical error correction aims at building a complete end-to-end application.",
        "This task is challenging since for many error types, current grammatical error correction systems do not achieve high performance and much research is still needed.",
        "Also, tackling this task has far-reaching impact, since it is estimated that hundreds of millions of people worldwide are learning English and they benefit directly from an automated grammar checker.",
        "The CoNLL-2013 shared task provides a forum for participating teams to work on the same grammatical error correction task, with evaluation on the same blind test set using the same evaluation metric and scorer.",
        "This overview paper contains a detailed description of the shared task, and is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 provides the task definition.",
        "Section 3 describes the annotated training data provided and the blind test data.",
        "Section 4 describes the evaluation metric and the scorer.",
        "Section 5 lists the participating teams and outlines the approaches to grammatical error correction used by the teams.",

        "The goal of the CoNLL-2013 shared task is to evaluate algorithms and systems for automatically detecting and correcting grammatical errors present in English essays written by second language learners of English.",
        "Each participating team is given training data manually annotated with corrections of grammatical errors.",
        "The test data consists of new, blind test essays.",
        "Preprocessed test essays, which have been sentence-segmented and tokenized, are also made available to the participating teams.",
        "Each team is to submit its system output consisting of the automatically corrected essays, in sentence-segmented and tokenized form.",
        "Grammatical errors consist of many different types, including articles or determiners, prepositions, noun form, verb form, subject-verb agreement, pronouns, word choice, sentence structure, punctuation, capitalization, etc.",
        "Of all the error types, determiners and prepositions are among",
        "the most frequent errors made by learners of English.",
        "Not surprisingly, much published research on grammatical error correction focuses on article and preposition errors (Han et al., 2006; Ga-mon, 2010; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010; Tetreault et al., 2010; Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011b), with relatively less work on correcting word choice errors (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011a).",
        "Article and preposition errors were also the only error types featured in the HOO 2012 shared task.",
        "Likewise, although all error types were included in the HOO 2011 shared task, almost all participating teams dealt with article and preposition errors only (besides spelling and punctuation errors).",
        "In the CoNLL-2013 shared task, it was felt that the community is now ready to deal with more error types, including noun number, verb form, and subject-verb agreement, besides articles/determiners and prepositions.",
        "Table 1 shows examples of the five error types in our shared task.",
        "Since there are five error types in our shared task compared to two in HOO 2012, there is a greater chance of encountering multiple, interacting errors in a sentence in our shared task.",
        "This increases the complexity of our shared task relative to that of HOO 2012.",
        "To illustrate, consider the following sentence: Although we have to admit some bad effect which is brought by the new technology, still the advantages of the new technologies cannot be simply discarded.",
        "The noun number error effect needs to be corrected (effect?",
        "effects).",
        "This necessitates the correction of a subject-verb agreement error (is ?",
        "are).",
        "A pipeline system in which corrections for subject-verb agreement errors occur strictly before corrections for noun number errors would not be able to arrive at a fully corrected sentence for this example.",
        "The ability to correct multiple, interacting errors is thus necessary in our shared task.",
        "The recent work of (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012a), for example, is designed to deal with multiple, interacting errors.",
        "Note that the essays in the training data and the test essays naturally contain grammatical errors of all types, beyond the five error types focused in our shared task.",
        "In the automatically corrected essays returned by a participating system, only corrections necessary to correct errors of the five types are made.",
        "The other errors are to be left uncorrected."

        "It is a collection of 1,414 essays written by students at the National University of Singapore (NUS) who are non-native speakers of English.",

        "The preprocessing operations performed on the NUCLE essays include sentence segmentation and word tokenization using the NLTK toolkit (Bird et al., 2009), and part-of-speech (POS) tagging, constituency and dependency tree parsing using the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003; de Marneffe et al., 2006).",

        "In our shared task, in order to facilitate the detection and correction of article/determiner errors and preposition errors, we performed automatic mapping of error types in the original NUCLE corpus.",
