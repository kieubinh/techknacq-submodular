        "A common view of dialogue is that the conversational record is part of the COMMON GROUND of the conversants.",
        "As conversants A and B participate in a dialogue, A and B communicate through dialogue speech acts such as PROPOSALS, ASSERTIONS, ACCEPTANCES and REJECTIONS.",
        "If A asserts a proposition ?",
        "and B accepts A's assertion, the ?",
        "becomes a mutual belief in the common ground.",
        "If B rejects A's assertion or proposal, the common ground remains as it was (Stalnaker, 1978).",
        "For conversants to remain coordinated (Thomason, 1990), they must monitor whether their utterances are accepted or rejected by their conversational partners.",
        "Computational models of dialogue also must track what is in the common ground (Traum, 1994; Stent, 2002).",
        "This would be simple if conversants always explicitly indicated rejection with forms such as I reject your assertion.",
        "However recognizing rejection typically relies on making inferences.",
        "Horn categorizes rejections into: DENIAL a straightforward negation of the other's assertion; LOGICAL CONTRADICTION following from logical inference; IMPLICIT DENIAL where B denies a presupposition of A?s; and REFUSAL, also called REJECTION where B refuses an offer or proposal of A's (Horn, 1989).",
        "See Fig. 2.",
        "All of Horn's forms can be identified as rejections by recognizing logical inconsistency either directly from what was said, or via an inferential chain.",
        "However subsequent work by Walker on the Harry Gross Corpus (henceforth HGC) of advice-giving dialogues (Pollack et al., 1982) demonstrated that REJECTION IMPLICATURES as seen in the 5th row of Fig. 2, are common in natural dialogue (Walker, 1996a).",
        "A number of similar examples can also be found in (Hirschberg, 1985).",
        "Here, the proposition realized by the response follows from the original assertion as an entailment via existential generalization.",
        "Thus the REJECTION IMPLICATURE is logically consistent with the original assertion.",
        "Walker argues that the fact that an implicature can function as a rejection clearly indicates that inference rules about what gets added to the common ground must have the same logical status as implicatures, i.e. they must be default rules of inference that can be defeated by context.",
        "She then goes on to identify additional types of rejections in HGC that rely on detecting conflicts in the default inferences triggered by the epistemic inference rules used in speech act theory.",
        "Walker uses a compressed version of rules from (Perrault, 1990; Appelt and Konolige, 1988), assuming that conflicting defaults can arise between these inferences and implicature inferences (Hirschberg, 1985).",
        "The first rule is given in 1:",
        "The Belief Transfer Rule states that if one agent A makes an assertion that p then by default another agent B will come to believe that p. The second rule is in 2: (2) BELIEF PERSISTENCE RULE: Bel (B,p,t0)?",
        "Bel (B,p,t1) The Belief Persistence Rule states that if an agent B believes p at time t0 then by default agent B still believes p at a later time t1.",
        "These rules provide the basis for inferring three additional types of rejections: ?",

        "INCONSISTENT PAST BELIEF: Inferring that B's expression of an inconsistent past belief is a type of rejection relies on detecting conflicting defaults with the Belief Transfer Rule and the Belief Persistence Rule.",

        "?",
        "CITING CONTRADICTORY AUTHORITY: Inferring that citing a contradictory authority is a type of rejection relies on recognizing two inconsistent instantiations of the Belief Transfer rule.",

        "We see many examples of hedges in online dialogue, e.g. the speaker of R2 in Fig. 3 uses the hedges Perhaps and essentially, and I mean in R5.",

        "Our aim was to test how well we can distinguish agreements and disagreements in IAC using classifiers trained with theoretically motivated features.",
        "As described above, we developed our features by manual inspection of (dis)agreements in 920 posts on the topic Evolution.",
        "We do not train on a mixture of topics for any feature set, including unigrams, because we assume that in general, new topics are always arising so there will not be annotated data for every topic.",
        "We evaluate the performance of all types of features on classifying (dis)agreements on other topics combined.",
        "We do not report per-topic results because our test set baseline accuracies vary a great deal by topic as do the size of the topic sets.",

        "topic-independent features, and Table 4 compares the accuracies of classifiers using these features to unigrams and bigrams when we train on Evolu",
        "tion and then test on our mixed-topic test set, using the Weka learners for Random forest and J48 Tree.",
        "Although unigrams and unigram+bigram achieves approximately 60% accuracy over a 50% baseline, paired t-tests on the result vectors show that the differences in accuracies are statistically significant when we compare ALL-TM features with unigrams and unigram+bigrams: Random Forest (p",

        "ber of features selected for ngrams, with sample features.",
        "Moreover even if we optimize on the test set by examining the variations in performance as a function of the number of features selected, ALL-TM still beats both unigram and unigram+bigram, when features are selected according to ranking by Gain Ratio.",
        "ALL-TM is significantly more accurate when compared to unigrams (p = .003) best accuracy of 62.5 with 2000 features, and better than unigram+bigram best accuracy of 62.7 for 4000 features (p = .007).",
        "See Table 5.",
        "More interestingly though, if we look at what features get selected ( Table 5), we see many features reminiscent of our theoretically motivated features.",
        "Features highly ranked by the Gain Ratio were topic-independent cues for disagreement such as understand, fail, nothing, never and Bigrams such as ?",
        "how, perhaps you, would you, never said.",
        "However there were few high ranked unigrams and bigrams for agreement.",
        "Also note that topic specific cues such as gene, catholic, creationist, geologist and the church are selected over any topic-independent cues for agreement.",
        "This corroborates our manual construction of a combined denial category with more than 300 words and a very limited agreement category.",
        "To test which features make the most difference, we also conducted ablation experiments (Table 6), as well as tests with individual features (Table 7).",
        "Table 6 shows that the CUE WORDS (p = .0008) and PUNCTUATION features (p = .01) have the biggest impact on performance.",

        "Since the J48 learner performs consistently better, we restrict our comparison of individual features in Table 7 to that learner.",
        "Table 7 shows that PUNCTUATION and CUE WORDS features by themselves provide significant performance improvements over the unigram baseline, and that the POLARITY, AGREEMENT, DENIAL and DURATION feature sets provide significant improvements on their own over the majority class baseline of 50%.",
        "A paired t-test shows these differences are significant at p =.02.",
        "To our surprise, the HEDGE feature was not effective, and we plan further refinements of it.",

        "We develop topic-independent features for classifying (dis)agreement in online dialogue, and show that we can beat an unfiltered unigram baseline by 6%, and even beat the best feature-selection ngram-based classifers fitted to the test set.",
        "Features we didn't use from previous work include word pairs as introduced by (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002), and used subsequently by (Pitler et al., 2009) and (Biran and Rambow, 2011).",
        "The issue of whether word pairs are topic-dependent has never been addressed, but the examples given in previous work suggest that they may indicate topic-specific comparisons.",
        "Previous work also",
        "suggests that context might be helpful in recognizing disagreement (Walker et al., 2012b), but we did not test the effect of context.",
        "The most similar work to our own trains a disagreement classifier for Q/R response pairs in online forums (Abbott et al., 2011).",
        "Their work used ngrams, MPQA opinion words (Stoyanov et al., 2005), LIWC (Pennebaker et al., 2001), and a different dataset (Q/R instead of P1,P2 datasets), and does not aim to develop a classifier that works well independently of topic.",
        "Their best accuracy is about 68% for a feature set called BothLocal for the JRip classifier using ?2 feature selection.",
        "BothLocal includes unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, LIWC, punctuation, cue words, dependency features, generalized dependency features and utterance length measures, and it is unclear whether these features are specific to topic.",
        "It is also difficult to directly compare the results because they do not report accuracies for individual feature sets or ablated feature experiments.",
        "For example, their unigram accuracy of 63% includes cue words, and is reported for training and testing on a mixture of topics without any held-out topics.",
        "Other work on disagreement recognition includes that of (Wang et al., 2011) who describe conditional random field model for detecting (dis)agreement between speakers in English broadcast conversations.",
        "They use sampling and prosodic features such as pause, duration and speech rate on an unbalanced dataset.",
        "They report an increase in F-measure of 4.5% for agreement and 4.7% for disagreement over a baseline of lexical, structural, and durational features.",
        "(Hahn et al., 2006) show that a contrast classifier improves the accuracy of dis(agreement) classification in the ICSI meetings corpus, and that their results are less affected by imbalanced data.",
        "They improve the F-measure to .755 over a baseline SVM with F-measure .726.",
        "(Yin et al., 2012) use sentiment, emotion and durational features for (dis)agreement classification in online forums, and they show that aggregating local positions over posts yields 3 to 4% better performance than non-aggregating baselines.",
        "While recognizing (dis)agreement can be useful in its own right, it has also been shown to be useful for the identification of stance (Gawron et al., 2012; Hassan et al., 2010; Thomas et al., 2006; Bansal et al., 2008; Murakami and Raymond, 2010; Agrawal et al., 2003).",
        "Work that focuses on the social network structure of online forums as a way to improve stance classification has either assumed that adjacent posts always disagree, or used simple rules for identifying agreement based on patterns in the reply post (Murakami and Raymond, 2010; Agrawal et al., 2003).",
        "Previous work by Somasundaran & Wiebe (2009, 2010) develops positive and negative arguing features for the classification of stance, that at least in motivation, resemble our denial features .",
        "They show that arguing features are helpful in stance classification.",
        "Work by (Galley et al., 2004) on detecting disagreement in meetings corpora similarly shows that pragmatic features are useful for detecting disagreement using models based on Bayesian Networks.",
        "(Walker et al., 2012b) use a number of linguistic features such as unigrams, bigrams, and repeated punctuation and proposed a supervised model for stance classification in online debates.",
        "Related work by (Hassan et al., 2010) focuses on identifying the attitude of the participants towards one another in online debates.",
        "They relate the polarity of words to the second person pronoun for classification, while related work by (Abu-Jbara et al., 2012) uses the polarity of expressions and named entity recognition to identify a subgroup of participants, where participants within a subgroup are inclined to agree with one another.",
        "Methods for stance classification in congressional debates do not separately evaluate the accuracy of (dis)agreement classification (Thomas et al., 2006; Bansal et al., 2008; Awadallah et al., 2010; Burfoot, 2008).",
        "In future work, we plan to develop more detailed patterns based on LIWC categories and syntactic parses (Thelen and Riloff, 2002).",
        "For example, an error analysis suggests that sometimes two people mutually reject the proposal or claim of a third person, e.g. How can they say that....",
        "In such cases our classifier finds the disagreement marker how can and classifies it as disagreement.",
        "More detailed syntactic processing would allow us to refine our patterns to identify particular classes of targets such as third person vs. first person.",
        "Similarly, here we extended patterns by hand, e.g. generalizations over pronouns such as I can't, we can't, can you, can we.",
        "In future we aim to generalize such patterns automatically using tagsets.",
        "We expect that more general patterns should improve the accuracy of the topic-independent feature sets.",
        "We also plan to carry out further annotation of the IAC corpus using the classes of rejections summarized in Fig. 2 to determine whether there are forms for indicating each type that are not represented by our features, and to determine the frequency across a sample of our corpus of the different types."
