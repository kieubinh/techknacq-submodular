        "Topic segmentation aims at finding the boundaries among topic blocks in a text (Chang and Lee, 2003).",
        "This task is useful for a number of important applications such as information retrieval (Prince and Labadi?, 2007), automatic summarization (Wan, 2008) and question-answering systems (Oh et al., 2007).",
        "In this paper, following Hearst (1997), we assume that a text or a set of texts develop a main topic, exposing several subtopics as well.",
        "We also assume that a topic is a particular subject that we write about or discuss (Hovy, 2009), and subtopics are represented in pieces of text that cover different aspects of the main topic (Hearst, 1997; Hennig, 2009).",
        "Therefore, the task of topic segmentation aims at dividing a text into topically coherent segments, or subtopics.",
        "The granularity of a subtopic is not defined, as a subtopic may contain one or more sentences or paragraphs.",
        "Several methods have been tested for topic segmentation.",
        "There are, however, no studies on how discourse structure directly mirrors topic boundaries in texts and how they may contribute to such task, although such possible correlation has been suggested (e.g., Hovy and Lin, 1998).",
        "In this paper, we follow this research line, aiming at exploring the relationship of discourse and subtopics.",
        "In particular, our interest is mainly on the potential of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1987) for this task.",
        "We propose and evaluate automatic topic segmentation strategies based on the rhetorical structure of a text.",
        "We also compare our results to some well-known algorithms in the area, showing that we outperform these algorithms.",
        "Our experiments were performed using a corpus of news texts manually annotated with RST and subtopics.",

        "Several approaches have tried to measure the similarity across sentences and to estimate where topic boundaries occur.",
        "One well-known approach, that is heavily used for topic segmentation, is TextTiling (Hearst, 1997), which is based on lexical cohesion.",
        "For this strategy, it is assumed that a set of lexical items is used during the development of a subtopic in a text and, when that subtopic changes, a significant proportion of vocabulary also changes.",
        "Passoneau and Litman (1997), in turn, have combined multiple linguistic features for topic segmentation of spoken text, such as pause, cue words, and referential noun phrases.",

        "techniques for topic segmentation, including those based on text structure, cue words and high-frequency indicative phrases for topic identification in a summarization system.",
        "Although the authors do not mention an evaluation of these features, they suggested that discourse structure might help topic identification.",
        "For this, they suggested using RST.",
        "RST represents relations among propositions in a text and discriminates nuclear and satellite information.",
        "In order to present the differences among relations, they are organized in two groups: subject matter and presentational relations.",
        "In the former, the text producer intends that the reader recognizes the relation itself and the information conveyed, while in the latter the intended effect is to increase some inclination on the part of the reader (Taboada and Mann, 2006).",
        "The relationships are traditionally structured in a treelike form (where larger units ?",
        "composed of more than one proposition ?",
        "are also related in the higher levels of the tree).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, we have not found any proposal that has directly employed RST for topic segmentation purposes.",

        "For identifying and partitioning the subtopics of a text, we developed four baseline algorithms and six other algorithms that are based on discourse features.",
        "The four baseline algorithms segment at paragraphs, sentences, random boundaries (randomly selecting any number of boundaries and where they are in a text) or are based on word reiteration.",
        "The word reiteration strategy is an adaptation of TextTiling1 (Hearst, 1997) for the characteristics of the corpus that we used (introduced latter in this paper).",
        "The algorithms based on discourse consider the discourse structure itself and the RST relations in the discourse tree.",
        "The first algorithm (which we refer to as Simple Cosine) is based on Marcu's idea (2000) for measuring the ?goodness?",
        "of a discourse tree.",
        "He assumes that a discourse tree is ?better?",
        "if it exhibits a high-level structure that matches as much as possible the 1 We have specifically used the block comparison method with block size=2.",
        "topic boundaries of the text for which that structure was built.",
        "Marcu associates a clustering score to each node of a tree.",
        "For the leaves, this score is 0; for the internal nodes, the score is given by the lexical similarity between the immediate children.",
        "The hypothesis underlying such measurements is that better trees show higher similarity among their nodes.",
        "We have adopted the same idea using the cosine measure.",
        "We have proposed that text segments with similar vocabulary are likely to be part of the same topic segment.",
        "In our case, nodes with scores below the average score are supposed to indicate possible topic boundaries.",
        "The second algorithm (referred to as Cosine Nuclei) is also a proposal by Marcu (2000).",
        "It is assumed that whenever a discourse relation holds between two textual spans, that relation also holds between the most salient units (nuclei) associated with those spans.",
        "We have used this formalization and measured the similarity between the salient units associated with two spans (instead of measuring among all the text spans of the relation, as in the previous algorithm).",
        "The third (Cosine Depth) and fourth (Nuclei Depth) algorithms are variations of Simple Cosine and Cosine Nuclei.",
        "For these new strategies, the similarity for each node is divided by the depth where it occurs, traversing the tree in a bottom-up way.",
        "These should guarantee that higher nodes are weaker and might better represent topic boundaries.",
        "Therefore, we have the assumption that topic boundaries are more likely to be mirrored at the higher levels of the discourse structure.",
        "We also have used the average score to find out less similar nodes.",
        "Figure 1 shows a sample RST tree.",
        "The symbols N and S indicate the nucleus and satellite of each rhetorical relation.",
        "For this tree, the score between nodes 3 and 4 is divided by 1 (since we are at the leaf level); the score between Elaboration and node 5 is divided by 2 (since we are in a higher level, 1 above the leaves on the left); and the score between Sequence and Volitional-result is divided by 3 (1 above the leaves on the right).",
        "The next algorithms are based on the idea that some relations are more likely to represent topic shifts.",
        "For estimating this, we have used the CSTNews (described in next section), which is manually annotated with subtopics and RST.",
        "In this corpus, there are 29 different types of RST relations that may connect textual spans.",
        "In an attempt to characterize topic segmentation based on rhetorical relations, we recorded the frequency of those relations in topic boundaries.",
        "We realized that some relations were more frequent on topic boundaries, whereas others never occurred at the boundaries of topics.",
        "Out of the 29 relations, 16 appeared in the reference annotation.",
        "In topic boundaries, Elaboration was the most frequent relation (appearing in 60% of the boundaries), followed by List (20%) and Non-Volitional Result (5%).",
        "Sequence and Evidence appeared in 2% of the topic boundaries, and",
        "Justify, and Non-Volitional Cause in 1% of the boundaries.",
        "We used this knowledge about the relations?",
        "frequency and attributed a weight associated with the possibility that a relation indicates a boundary, in accordance with its frequency on topic boundaries in the reference corpus.",
        "Figure 2 shows how the 29 relations were distributed.",
        "One relation is weak if it usually indicates a boundary; in this case, its weight is 0.4.",
        "One relation is medium because it may indicate a boundary or not; therefore, its weight is 0.6.",
        "On the other hand, a strong relation almost never indicates a topic boundary; therefore, its weight is 0.8.",
        "Such values were empirically determined.",
        "Another factor that may be observed is that all presentational relations are classified as strong, with the exception of Antithesis.",
        "This is related to the definition of presentational relations, and Antithesis was found in the reference segmentation with a low frequency.",
        "a score to the nodes by dividing the relations weight by the depth where it occurs, in a bottom-up way of traversing the tree.",
        "We also have used the average score to find out nodes that are less similar.",
        "As we have observed that some improvement might be achieved every time nuclei information was used, we have tried to combine this configuration with the relations?",
        "weight.",
        "Hence, we computed the scores of the Nuclei Depth strategy times the proposed relations weight.",
        "This was the algorithm that we called Nuclei_Depth_Relation.",
        "Therefore, these two last algorithms enrich the original Cosine Depth and Nuclei Depth strategies with the relation strength information.",

        "However, it is also important to know how close the identified boundaries are to the expected ones, since this may help to determine how serious the errors made by the algorithms are.",

        "This shows that, in most of the texts, the subtopics are organized in paragraphs.",

        "This happens because it is very conservative and detects only a few segments, sometimes only one (the end of the text), causing it to have a good deviation score, but penalizing R.",
        "In the case of the algorithms based on RST, we may notice that they produced the best results in terms of R, P, and F, with acceptable D values.",
        "We note too that every time the salient units were used, R and P increase, except for Nu-clei_Depth_Relation.",
        "Examining the measures, we notice that the best algorithm was Rela-tion_Depth.",
        "Although its F is close to the one of the Paragraph baseline, the Relation_Depth algorithm shows a much better D value.",
        "One may see that the traditional TextTiling was also outperformed by Relation_Depth.",
