        "Spoken Dialogue Systems typically indicate their lack of understanding of user input by simple requests for repetition or rephrasing ?",
        "?I'm sorry, I didn't understand you.",
        "?, or ?Can you please repeat??.",
        "However human conversational partners generally provide more targeted clarification requests.",
        "Corpus analysis of human conversations have shown that people are more likely to indicate what they have understood and what they have not understood by producing reprise clarification questions (Purver, 2004; Stoyanchev et al., 2012a), as illustrated in the following exchange where XXX indicates a word misunderstood by speaker B: A: Do you have any XXX in your bag?",
        "B: Do I have any what in my bag?",
        "A reprise clarification question targets a specific mis-recognized word and incorporates recognized context into a clarification question.",
        "We investigate replacing generic please repeat clarifications with more natural targeted clarifications in automatic spoken systems.",
        "Targeted clarifications allow users to provide a concise response to a clarification question which is beneficial for spoken systems accepting broad vocabulary and flexible syntax.",
        "Examples of such systems include tutoring systems, intelligent assistants, and spoken translation systems (Litman and Silliman, 2004; Dzikovska et al., 2009; Akbacak et al., 2009).",
        "To enable Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS) to generate targeted clarification questions, we must first be able to identify mis-recognized words with high accuracy.",
        "We term such mis-recognition detection localized error detection.",
        "Accurate distinction between correctly and incorrectly recognized words is essential to the creation of appropriate targeted clarification questions.",
        "In previous research on recognition error detection in dialogue systems, researchers have addressed error detection at the utterance level (Hirschberg et al., 2004; Komatani and Okuno, 2010).",
        "In this paper we present results of classification experiments designed to detect localized errors within the utterance.",
        "Our baseline results are obtained from a classifier trained only on word posterior probabilities generated by an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) engine.",
        "ASR confidence score computation is an active research area, relying upon acoustic and lexical collocation information to compute confidence scores.",
        "We determine whether improvement over baseline can be achieved by training a classifier for utterance and word mis-recognition prediction on an expanded feature set that includes lexical, positional, prosodic, semantic, syntactic as well as additional ASR score features.",
        "All of the features we experiment with can be computed from an ASR hypothesis without affecting the performance of a SDS materially.",
        "After determining optimal feature sets we experiment with one-and two-stage approaches for localized error detection.",
        "The first simply identifies whether a word is correctly recognized or not.",
        "The second first classifies an utterance as incorrect or correct and then classifies errors only on utterances labeled incorrect.",
        "This work extends earlier work in which we evaluated a smaller set of syntactic and prosodic features (Stoyanchev et al., 2012b).",
        "In addition to improvements implemented in the ASR engine that we use to produce ASR hypotheses, our current work reports results on a larger dataset which includes commands to the system and utterances containing disfluencies.",
        "Here, we propose a framework for localized error detection that does not rely upon pre-filtering of the dataset.",
        "In Section 2 we describe our corpus.",
        "In Section 3 we discuss our classification experiments.",
        "In Section 4 we discuss our results.",

        "We find that certain lexical, positional, and syntactic features improve classification results over a baseline feature set containing only ASR posterior score features.",
        "We improve incorrect F-measure for utterance mis-recognition prediction by 2.2% by adding utterance length, location, fraction 3?2test(p < .01) of function words to total words, average word length, and unigram and bigram count to the baseline feature set.",
        "By removing average word length as well as unigram and bigram count from this optimal set for utterances and adding the current word's ASR-context features, length, distance from first word, POS tag, Content/Function tag as well as the length of the current's words surrounding 1 or 2 word contexts, we improve incorrect F-measure for word mis-recognition prediction by 3.9% .",
        "We then employ these feature sets in 1-stage and 2-stage approached to obtain our final results.",
        "The 2-stage (no up-sampling) approach yields the highest precision for detection of word mis-recognition at 51% while the 1-stage (with 35% up-sampling) approach yields the highest recall for detection of word mis-recognition at 72%.",
        "In order to implement this approach in a working dialog system we would need to increase our word mis-recognition precision.",
        "The presence of false positives in mis-recognition prediction (correctly recognized words classified as mis-recognized) could lead to unnecessary clarification requests ?",
        "potentially derailing the dialogue.",
        "In future work we will experiment with additional corpora as well as with an even more fine-grained approach to local error detection, looking for deletions, insertions, and substitutions.",
        "Potentially, optimal classifiers could be found for each of these types of mis-recognition.",
        "If we are able to identify the type of ASR error as well as its location, we should be able to improve our construction of clarifications questions.",
        "We will also continue our investigation of how to use reprise clarification questions in SDS.",
        "Once we have detected localized ASR errors we must still refine our strategies for constructing clarification questions using this information.",
