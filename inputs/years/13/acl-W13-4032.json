        "One of the first steps toward dealing with psychological disorders such as depression and PTSD is diagnosing the problem.",
        "However, there is often a shortage of trained health care professionals, or of access to those professionals, especially for certain segments of the population such as military personnel and veterans (Johnson et al., 2007).",
        "One possible partial remedy is to use virtual human characters to do a preliminary triage screening, so that mental healthcare providers can focus their attention on those who are most likely to need help.",
        "The virtual human would engage an individual in an interview and analyze some of their behavioral characteristics.",
        "In addition to serving a triage function, this automated interview could produce valuable information to help the healthcare provider make their expert diagnosis.",
        "In this paper, we investigate whether features in the linguistic behavior of participants in a conversation with a virtual human could be used for recognizing psychological distress.",
        "We focus specifically on indicators of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the verbal behavior of participants in a Wizard-of-Oz corpus.",
        "The results and analysis presented here are part of a broader effort to create an automated, interactive virtual human dialogue system that can detect indicators of psychological distress in the multi-modal communicative behavior of its users.",
        "Realizing this vision requires a careful and strategic design of the virtual human's dialogue behavior, and in concert with the system's behavior, the identification of robust ?indicator?",
        "features in the verbal and nonverbal responses of human interviewees.",
        "These indicators should be specific behavior patterns that are empirically correlated with specific psychological disorders, and that can inform a triage screening process or facilitate the diagnosis or treatment performed by a clinician.",
        "In this paper, we report on several kinds of such indicators we have observed in a corpus of 43 Wizard-of-Oz interactions collected with our prototype virtual human, Ellie, pictured in Figure 1.",
        "We begin in Section 2 with a brief discussion of background and related work on the communicative behavior associated with psychological distress.",
        "In Section 3, we describe our Wizard-of-Oz data set.",
        "Section 4 presents an analysis of indicator features we have explored in this data set, identifying several significant differences between subjects with depression and PTSD when compared to non-distressed subjects.",
        "In Section 5 we present statistical classification results that suggest the potential for automatic assessment of psychological distress based on individual interactions with a virtual human dialogue system.",

        "There has been a range of psychological and clinical research that has identified differences in the",
        "communicative behavior of patients with specific psychological disorders such as depression.",
        "In this section, we briefly summarize some closely related work.",
        "Most work has observed the behavior of patients in human-human interactions, such as clinical interviews and doctor-patient interactions.",
        "PTSD is generally less well studied than depression.",
        "Examples of the kinds of differences that have been observed in non-verbal behavior include differences in rates of mutual gaze and other gaze patterns, downward angling of the head, mouth movements, frowns, amount of gesturing, fidgeting, emotional expressivity, and voice quality; see Scherer et al. (2013) for a recent review.",
        "In terms of verbal behavior, our exploration of features here is guided by several previous observations in the literature.",
        "Cohn and colleagues have identified increased speaker-switch durations and decreased variability of vocal fundamental frequency as indicators of depression, and have explored the use of these features for classification (Cohn et al., 2009).",
        "That work studied these features in human-human clinical interviews, rather than in virtual human interactions as reported here.",
        "In clinical studies, acute depression has been associated with decreased speech, slow speech, delays in delivery, and long silent pauses (Hall et al., 1995).",
        "Aggregate differences in lexical frequencies have also been observed.",
        "For example, in written essays, Rude et al. (2004) observed that depressed participants used more negatively va-lenced words and used the first-person pronoun ?I?",
        "more frequently than never-depressed individuals.",
        "Heeman et al. (2010) observed differences in children with autism in how long they pause before speaking and in their use of fillers, acknowledg-ments, and discourse markers.",
        "Some of these features are similar to those studied here, but looked at children communicating with clinicians rather than a virtual human dialogue system.",
        "Recent work on machine classification has demonstrated the ability to discriminate between schizophrenic patients and healthy controls based on transcriptions of spoken narratives (Hong et al., 2012), and to predict patient adherence to medical treatment from word-level features of dialogue transcripts (Howes et al., 2012).",
        "Automatic speech recognition and word alignment has also been shown to give good results in scoring narrative recall tests for identification of cognitive impairment (Prud?hommeaux and Roark, 2011; Lehr et al., 2012)."

        "Based on our observation of classification performance using individual features, we believe there remains much room for improvement in feature selection and training.",
        "A larger data set would enable feature selection approaches that use held out data, and would likely result in both increased performance and deeper insights into the most valuable combination of features for classification."
