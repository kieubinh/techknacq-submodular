        "Learning dialogue management models poses significant challenges.",
        "In a complex task-oriented domain in which information is exchanged via parallel, interleaved dialogue and task streams, effective dialogue management models should be able to make dialogue moves based on both the dialogue and the task context.",
        "This paper presents a data-driven approach to learning dialogue management models that determine when to make dialogue moves to assist users?",
        "task completion activi-ties, as well as the type of dialogue move that should be selected for a given user interaction context.",
        "Combining features automatically extracted from the dialogue and the task, we compare two alternate modeling approaches.",
        "The results of an evaluation indicate the learned models are effective in predicting both the timing and the type of system dialogue moves.",
        "1 Introduction Automated dialogue systems allow users to interact with information systems in a natural and intuitive manner.",
        "With the growth of speech-enabled applications for mobile devices, the demands for practical dialogue systems have been increasing at an accelerating pace.",
        "The core tasks of automated dialogue systems include dialogue management, which is concerned with selecting system actions in response to a given user input.",
        "Traditionally, dialogue managers have been manually constructed.",
        "However, manually crafting dialogue managers is labor-intensive and yields systems that are brittle with respect to unexpected user behaviors.",
        "For rapid creation of robust and adaptive dialogue systems, data-driven approaches to dialogue management hold much appeal.",
        "Recent work on dialogue systems has explored machine learning techniques to automatically learn dialogue managers from corpora (Scheffler and Young, 2002; Hardy et al., 2006; Williams and Young, 2007; Bangalore et al., 2008; Sridhar et al., 2009).",
        "To support more natural human-computer dia-logue, earlier work on dialogue systems envisioned rich interaction environments that take into account observed user actions for selecting optimal dialogue strategies (Carberry, 1990; Rich and Sidner, 1998; Allen et al., 2001).",
        "However, recent data-driven approaches have primarily focused on application domains in which information between the user and the system are communicated solely by dialogue, such as tele-phone-based systems (Hardy et al., 2006; Bangalore et al., 2008) and online chat dialogues (Ivanovic, 2008; Kim et al., 2010).",
        "With increasing demands for natural human-computer interaction beyond these restricted application do-mains, dialogue systems are required to support more complex types of interaction, in which users perform tasks in parallel to exchanging dia-logue.",
        "For instance, dialogue interfaces for task-assistance systems, such as intelligent tutoring systems, should be able to monitor users?",
        "task completion activities and incorporate the observed activities into dialogue management decisions such that the systems can provide users with spontaneous assistance (e.g., providing hints) even without an explicit request from the user.",
        "We have been exploring data-driven approaches for a complex task-oriented application domain in which information is delivered both by exchanging dialogue with users and by observing users?",
        "task completion activities.",
        "Our previous work has focused on the automatic interpretation of user dialogue input (Boyer et al.,",
        "2010; Ha et al., 2012).",
        "Findings suggest that identifying an effective representation to combine information from dialogue and users?",
        "task completion activities is key to effective dialogue processing in a domain consisting of parallel dialogue and task streams.",
        "As the next step in this line of investigation on complex task-oriented domains with parallel dialogue and task streams, this work proposes an approach to automatically learning dialogue management models from a human dialogue cor-pus.",
        "The proposed approach combines information from a dialogue stream and a task stream in order to create spontaneous dialogue interventions for users based on monitoring users?",
        "activi-ties.",
        "Two subtasks of dialogue management are addressed: the first is to determine when to provide dialogue feedback (timing), and the second is to determine what kind of dialogue feedback to provide (type).",
        "Dialogue managers in conventional domains have primarily focused on the selection of feedback type.",
        "However, determining the appropriate timing of system moves is critical for dialogue systems that support parallel dialogue and task streams.",
        "The work presented here makes three contri-butions.",
        "First, it endeavors to expand data-driven dialogue management by addressing more complex task-oriented domains consisting of parallel dialogue and task streams.",
        "Second, it proposes a timing intervention model that determines the correct time to make spontaneous system inter-ventions.",
        "Third, it presents a maximum entropy dialogue management model and compares alternate approaches.",
        "It also compares the predictive power of the dialogue and task streams on the targeted dialogue management tasks.",
        "2 Related Work Data-driven approaches to dialogue management continue to be the subject of increasing attention within the dialogue community.",
        "Prominent among these are reinforcement learning approaches for learning dialogue policies from corpora (Henderson et al., 2008; Levin et al., 2000; Lewis and Di Fabbrizio, 2006; Roy et al., 2000; Scheffler and Young, 2002; Singh et al., 2002; Williams and Young, 2007; Young, 2002).",
        "These approaches model dialogue as Markov decision processes, either fully observable (MDPs) or partially observable (POMDPs), in which the transitions of dialogue states are associated with system actions and rewards.",
        "The goal of reinforcement learning is to learn optimal policies that maximize aggregate expected rewards, such as user satisfaction (Walker et al., 1997).",
        "Learned policies that result from RL exploration do not, by design, necessarily reflect the patterns in the bootstrap dialogue corpus.",
        "Additionally, to cover all possible state spaces, reinforcement learning typically requires a very large set of training da-ta, which limits the complexity of the dialogue system in its representation of the dialogue states and the system actions (Young et al., 2013).",
        "A second body of related work focuses on dialogue act classification.",
        "Classification-based approaches aim at learning the patterns of dialogue that are present in the corpus.",
        "A variety of machine learning frameworks have been exploited, including hidden Markov models (Stolcke et al., 2000; Boyer et al., 2010), maximum entropy models (Bangalore et al., 2008; Sridhar et al., 2009; Ha et al., 2012), support vector machines (Ivanovic, 2008), conditional random fields (Kim et al., 2010), and memory-based classifiers in combination with latent semantic analysis (Di Eugenio et al., 2010).",
        "Classification-based approaches incorporate rich sets of features, including not only lexical information, syntactic fea-tures, and dialogue structure, but also prosodic features in the case of spoken dialogue (Stolcke et al., 2000; Sridhar et al., 2009) and non-verbal features such as facial expressions (Boyer et al., 2011) and shifts in posture (Ha et al., 2012).",
        "While most work on dialogue act classification has focused on either offline analysis of dialogue (Stolcke et al., 2000; Ivanovic, 2008; Kim et al., 2010; Di Eugenio et al., 2010) or interpretation of user dialogue (Boyer et al., 2010; Ha et al., 2012), Bangalore et al. (2008) utilized dialogue act classification as a mechanism for determining system dialogue moves.",
        "They proposed a unified dialogue act classification approach for both the interpretation of user utterances and selection of system dialogue moves.",
        "Our work is similar to Bangalore et al. (2008) in that it takes a dialogue act classification approach to the task of selecting system dialogue moves.",
        "However, it addresses the problems posed by complex task-oriented application domains in which information is communicated not only by dialogue exchanges but also by monitoring users?",
        "task performance.",
        "In such domains, a user's task activities constitute a full communicative stream in its own right, separate from the dialogue stream.",
        "The challenges of parallel dialogue and task streams are addressed by exploiting automatically obtained task features combined with dialogue features.",
        "In contrast to pre",
        "vious work (Bangalore et al. 2008, Boyer et al., 2010), in which task information was derived from manual annotation, our work utilizes automatically computed task features.",
        "Our work also focuses on a growing application area of dialogue systems: intelligent tutor-ing.",
        "In support of student learning, recent work in this area utilized human tutorial dialogue corpora to learn effective tutorial strategies using MDPs (Chi et al., 2010; Mitchell et al., 2013), to develop tutorial dialogue models that adapt to students?",
        "affective states (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011), and to improve robustness of a symbolic tutorial dialogue system (Dzikovska et al., 2013).",
        "3 Task-Oriented Dialogue Corpus To learn dialogue management models from naturally occurring human-to-human dialogue we utilize a human tutorial dialogue corpus we collected in the domain of introductory programming in Java.",
        "The corpus consists of textual dialogue exchanges between students and tutors in a web-based remote-tutoring interface, aligned with task context logs (Appendix A).",
        "A subset of the corpus was annotated with dialogue acts, which was used to train and test the dialogue management models described in this paper.",
        "3.1 Human tutoring study The data collection study involved forty-two undergraduate students who were paired with one of four tutors.",
        "The students were enrolled in a first-year engineering course and were pre-screened to filter out those with significant programming experience.",
        "The students were compensated for their participation with partial course credit.",
        "The tutors were graduate students with previous tutoring or teaching experience in Java programming, and the students worked with the same tutor for the entire study.",
        "Each lesson consisted of between four and thirteen distinct subtasks.",
        "The students completed six forty-minute tutoring lessons, covering progressive topics in introductory computer science over four weeks.",
        "Each lesson consisted of four to thirteen subtasks, in which later subtasks built upon earlier ones.",
        "Dur-ing each tutoring session, the paired student and tutor interacted remotely using a web-based tutoring interface.",
        "With this tutoring interface, the student and the tutor were able to exchange textual dialogue and share a synchronized view of the task.",
        "For each lesson, students completed a pretest and a post-test before and after the main tutoring session.",
        "The pre-and post-test consisted of the same set of questions to assess students?",
        "knowledge related to the lesson's objectives.",
        "Compared to students?",
        "pre-test results, significant learning gains were observed on the post-test, which indicates that the tutorial dialogue was effective for student learning (Mitchell et al., 2012).",
        "3.2 Dialogue annotation A subset of the collected data was manually annotated with dialogue acts using an annotation scheme consisting of 13 dialogue act tags for task-oriented tutorial dialogue (Table 1).",
        "The annotated corpus consists of the first of the six tutoring lessons from 21 students, which contains 2564 utterances (1777 tutor, 787 student).",
        "The average number of utterances per tutoring session was 122 (min = 74; max = 201).",
        "The average number of tutor utterances per session was 84.6 (min = 51; max = 137), and the average number of student utterances per session was 37.4 (min = 22; max = 64).",
        "Three human annotators were trained to apply the scheme.",
        "The training consisted of an iterative process involving collaborative and independent tagging, followed by refinements of the tagging protocol.",
        "At the initial phase of training, the annotators tagged the corpus collaboratively.",
        "In later phases annotators tagged independently.",
        "To compute agreement between different annotators, 24% (5 of the 21 sessions) of the corpus were doubly annotated by two annotators.",
        "All possible pairs of the annotators participated in double an-notation.",
        "The aggregate agreement was 0.80 in Cohen's Kappa (Cohen, 1960).",

        "Among the thirteen dialogue acts in the original annotation scheme (Section 3.2), four rarely occurring dialogue acts were combined into other categories, which include LF (lukewarm feed-back) merged with NF (negative feedback) and RC (request for confirmation), RF (request for feedback), and C (correction) merged to O (oth-er).",
        "A new category, GREET (greetings) was",
        "added to distinguish conventional expressions for greetings and thanks from more general statements and questions.",
        "Table 4 shows the resulting distribution of tutor dialogue acts in the corpus.",
        "The performance of the dialogue act models were evaluated in a tenfold cross validation.",
        "In the cross validation, the corpus was partitioned to ten non-overlapping sets and each set was used as testing data exactly once, while models were trained using the remaining nine sets.",
        "6.1 Results The first study compared the accuracies of the dialogue management models on predicting the timing and the type of tutor dialogue moves.",
        "The accuracy of the timing prediction was calculated for all user interaction logs in the data, including both dialogue exchanges and task-completion activities.",
        "The accuracy of the type prediction was calculated for dialogue activities by tutors only.",
        "The results are shown in Table 5.",
        "Both the one-step (t(9) = 4.14, p = 0.0013) and the two-step (t(9) = 6.26, p < .0001) models performed significantly better than the majority baseline in predicting the timing of tutorial dialogue moves.",
        "The two-step model achieved higher accuracy than the one-step model.",
        "The difference between the two models was statistically significant (t(9) = 2.17, p = 0.0291).",
        "The one-step (t(9) = 2.68, p = 0.0126) and the two-step (t(9) = 10.93, p < 0.0001) models achieved significantly higher accuracies over the baseline for the task of predicting the type of tutorial dialogue moves, as well.",

        "In this study, the accuracy of the two-step model was compared in three conditions: using the dialogue features only (Dialogue), using the task features only (Task), and using all features (All).",
        "Table 6 reports the results.",
        "For determining when to intervene, the dialogue and the task features exhibited similar predictive power.",
        "No statistical significance was found for the difference between the dialogue and the task conditions.",
        "The highest accuracy was achieved by the All condition.",
        "Compared to the All condition, the Dialogue condition showed statistically significant decrease in accuracy (t(9) = 2.21, p = 0.0272), which implies the task stream provided important features for the dialogue management model in determining the timing of tutorial dialogue moves.",
        "A similar trend was observed for determining what type of dialogue move to make.",
        "The Dialogue and the Task conditions achieved similar accuracies, with the highest accuracy achieved by the All condition.",

        "(t(9) = 4.36, p = 0.0009).",
        "The results imply that the prediction of the type of tutorial dialogue moves required information from both the dialogue and the task streams.",
        "7 Discussion The experiments presented in Section 6 compared two alternate approaches to learning dialogue management models for two given sub-tasks: determining when to provide the user with a dialogue move, and determining which type of",
        "dialogue move to choose.",
        "The results suggest that the two-step approach, which models the two subtasks as separate classifiers, was more effective than the alternate one-step approach, which combined the two subtasks into a single classification problem.",
        "The two-step model achieved higher performance than the one-step model in both the timing and the type prediction.",
        "However, the difference in the performance of the two models was more apparent in the type prediction, with the two-step model achieving over 22% higher accuracy than the one-step model.",
        "One possible explanation for the superiority of the two step-model over the one-step model is that the corpus used to train the models was highly skewed.",
        "For more than 73% of the total interaction logs in the corpus, the tutors did not provide any dialogue feedback.",
        "Since the one-step model treated NoMove as a special dialogue act, the skewed distribution over NoMove and Move impacted the learned distribution over dialogue acts.",
        "Two previous investigations reported the accuracies of dialogue act classification on system utterances.",
        "Bangalore et al. (2008) reported a prediction accuracy of 55% for system dialogue acts when a flat task model was used in a cata-logue-ordering domain.",
        "When a hierarchical task structure was used in the same domain, the achieved prediction accuracy for system dialogue acts was 35.6% (Bangalore and Stent, 2009).",
        "Boyer (2010) achieved accuracy of 57% for system dialogue acts in a task-oriented tutorial dia-logue.",
        "While both of these lines of investigation employed task structure features that were manually annotated, our best-performing two-step dialogue management model resulted in comparable performance utilizing only automatic features, achieving an accuracy of 49.7%.",
        "A crucial distinction between user and system dialogue act classification is that lexical features for a given dialogue turn are not available for system dialogue act classification because a system utterance is generated after a system dialogue act is selected.",
        "The absence of lexical features poses a significant challenge to system dialogue act classification, given that lexical features have been among the most predictive features for this task.",
        "To address this challenge, future research should continue exploring larger spaces of features to improve prediction accuracies of learned models."

      "heading": "8 Conclusions and Future Work Automatically learning dialogue management models for complex task-oriented domains with separate dialogue and task streams poses significant challenges. Effective dialogue management models in such domains should be able to proac-tively intervene by making spontaneous dialogue moves based on the observed history of both the dialogue and the user's task activities. With the overarching goal of creating a data-driven automated dialogue system that incorporates parallel dialogue and task streams, this paper has presented classification-based dialogue management models that integrate a rich set of features automatically extracted from parallel dialogue and task streams. Two subtasks of dialogue management were considered: when the system should provide user with a dialogue move and what type of system dialogue act the system should select for a given user interaction context. An evaluation found that a two-step approach that modeled the two subtasks as separate classifiers were ef-fective, achieving significantly higher performance than an alternate approach that modeled the two subtasks with a single classifier. The results suggest several promising directions for future work. First, incorporating richer features may improve the accuracies of learned models, such as more global interaction histories and deeper dialogue structures. Second, developing more sophisticated task analyses will inform the learned models with a representation of the user task context, guiding the models to make more context-appropriate decisions. Finally, it will be important to evaluate the learned models by incorporating them into a dialogue management system and validating their effectiveness in interactions with users in rich task-oriented dialogue.
