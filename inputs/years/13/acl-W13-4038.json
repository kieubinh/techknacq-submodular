        "Many dialog agents often can perform multiple tasks: think of a customer service kiosk system at a bank.",
        "The system has to decide which task it has to perform by talking to its user.",
        "This problem of identifying what to do based on what a user has said is called task prediction.",
        "Task prediction is typically framed as a parsing problem: A grammar is written to semantically parse the input utterance from users, and these semantic labels in combination are used to decide what the intended task is.",
        "However, this method is less robust to errors in user-input.",
        "A dialog system consists of a pipeline of cascaded modules, such as speech recognition, parsing, dialog management.",

        "These approaches mainly use local features such as dialog context, speech features and grammar-based-semantic features to determine the task.",
        "However grammar-based-semantic features would be insufficient if an utterance uses semantically similar phrases that are not in the system's domain or semantics.",
