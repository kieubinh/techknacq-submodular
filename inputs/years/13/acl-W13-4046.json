        "The research by Hyland (1998) is one of the broadest studies about hedging functions in scientific articles, and which makes use of categories that have strong relationship, at face value, to the likelihood that the reader of hedged material will find the material sufficiently useful or sufficiently well expressed to prompt the reader to rate highly the message containing the material, whether with an explicit facility to record kudos or otherwise.",
        "Hyland proposed a poly-pragmatic classification of hedges based on their indicating function: reader-oriented, writer-oriented, attribute and reliability.",
        "Briefly, attribute and reliability hedges both relate to the accuracy of the message conveyed.",
        "Attribute hedges relate to the conformity of the described situation with encyclopedic expectations (1), while reliability hedges relate to the level of certainty of the speaker about the propositional content (2).",
        "In a different dimension, reader ori",
        "ented hedges are composed with the concern that the ?reader?",
        "accept the truth of the embedded content (3), thereby presupposing the ?writer?s?",

        "(4) Based on what you?ve said, you seem",
        "right.",
        "Applying this classification scheme not to scholarly prose but to web forums, it seems likely that readers in technical forums would prefer the accuracy of attribute hedges (1) over the relative uncertainty of reliability hedges (2), and that the reader oriented hedges (3) supply comfort in the implication of both the quality of the embedded claims and the absence of arrogance.",
        "This research is attempting to test these hypotheses by assessing the relationship between the likelihood of posts receiving kudos and the quantity of hedges in these categories that the posts contain.",
        "Unfortunately, answering the question is complex, because it is not in all cases obvious whether a linguistic expression contains a hedge or what function the hedges serve when they do exist.",
        "Therefore, we attempt a partial answer to the question by examining those hedge expressions which can be processed with some reliability using automated means.",
        "Consider the taxonomy of linguistic expressions in Fig. 1.",
        "The boxed regions of this taxonomy are amenable to automatic processing.",
        "Further, epistemic hedges with first-person singular subjects relate strongly to reader oriented hedges (3) in Hyland's taxonomy.",
        "The non-phrasal hedges are heterogeneous in function.",
        "We do not claim this separation of hedging markers can fully account for pragmatic and semantic analysis of hedging in web forums, but we are confident this classification supports reliable annotation for quantificational assessment of certainty and hedging in this informal domain.",

        "In ?3.1 we showed there are two ways to characterize a post: 1) By its writer category and 2) by the number of times it gets accorded kudos.",
        "We devise a third characterisation by exploring epistemic phrases and non-phrasal hedge usage in individual posts as a whole, tracking use of both types of hedge in each post.",
        "We devised three discretization functions (DF) for assigning a label to each post depending on the type of hedges contained within.",
        "The DFs take two parameters, each one representing either the relative or bina-rized frequency non-phrasal hedges and epistemic phrases (nphr or epphr).",
        "DF1 relies on the occurrence of either type of hedge; a post is of a mixed nature if it has at least one of each hedge type.",
        "DF2 is based on a majority decision depending on the hedge type that governs the post and only assigns the label hedgmixed when both types of hedges appear in the same magnitude.",
        "DF3 expands DF1 and DF2 by evaluating whether either majority or only one type of hedge is found, e.g. we wanted to explore the fact that even when non-phrasal hedges domain one post, an epistemic phrase is contained as well, in contrast to when only non-phrasal hedges occur in a post.",
        "We computed four measures for each post based on these functions, m1 is calculated by using DF1 having raw frequencies of hedges as parameters, m2 and m3 result from applying DF3 and DF2 respectively to frequencies of hedge type averaged by the corresponding lexicon size, and m4 is calculated from DF3 over hedge frequencies averaged by post word count.",
        "Other measures are also possible, but these seemed most intuitive.",
        "We were interested in the extent that hedge-based post categories correlate with a post's kudos and with a post's user category as tests of hypothesis outlined in ?2.",
        "We want to know which correlations hold regardless of the choice of intuitive measure and which are measure dependent."

        "These two approaches to assessing associations between different classifications of forum posts reveal that posts using hedges are the most likely to be accorded kudos and that guru and ranked users are the most frequent users of epistemic phrases in general.",
