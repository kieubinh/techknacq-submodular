        "The primary challenge of a Dialogue Act Recogniser (DAR) is to find the correct mapping between a noisy user input and its true dialogue act.",
        "In standard 'slot-filling' dialogue systems a dialogue act is generally represented as DialogueActType(attribute-value pairs), see Section 3.",
        "While a substantial body of research has investigated different types of models and methods for dialogue act recognition in spoken dialogue systems (see Section 2), here we focus on re-ranking the outputs of an existing DAR for evaluation purposes.",
        "In practice the re-ranker should be part of the DAR itself.",
        "We propose to use multiple Bayesian classifiers to re-rank an initial set of dialogue act hypotheses based on information from the dialogue history as well as ASR N-best lists.",
        "In particular the latter type of information helps us to learn mappings between dialogue acts and common mis-recognitions.",
        "We present experimental results based on the Let's Go dialogue corpora which indicate that re-ranking hypotheses using ASR N-best information can lead to improved recognition.",
        "In addition, we compare the recognition accuracy over time and find that high accuracy can be obtained with as little context as one system dialogue act, so that there is often no need to take a larger context into account."
