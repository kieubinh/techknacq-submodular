        "We present two dialogue systems for language learning which both restrict the dialog to a specific domain thereby promoting robustness and the learning of a given vocabulary.",
        "The systems vary in how much they constrain the learner's answer : one system places no other constrain on the learner than that provided by the restricted domain and the dialog context ; the other provides the learner with an exercise whose solution is the expected answer.",
        "The first system uses supervised learning for simulating a human tutor whilst the second one uses natural language generation techniques to produce grammar exercises which guide the learner toward the expected answer."

        "Work on dialog based tutors for language learning includes both chatbot systems which maintain a free flowing dialog with the learner (Shawar and Atwell, 2007; Jia, 2004) and form-focused dialog systems which restrict the learner answer e.g., by providing her with an answer template to be filled in for the dialog to continue (Wilske and Wolska, 2011).",
        "While the former encourages language practice with a virtual tutor and requires a good knowledge of the language, the latter focuses on linguistic forms and usually covers a more restricted lexical field thereby being more amenable to less advanced learners.",
        "In these notes, we describe a dialog architecture which (i) supports both free-flowing and form-focused man/machine dialog ; and (ii) ensures that in both cases, dialogs are restricted to a specific lexical field.",
        "The free-flowing dialog system uses supervised classification techniques to predict the system dialog move based on the learner's input and does not explicitely constrain the learner's answer.",
        "In contrast, the dialog system for intermediate learners provides an exercise which the learner must solve to construct her answer.",
        "To restrict the dialog to a specific domain and to improve system robustness, we make use of a finite-state automaton (FSA) describing the range of permissible interactions within a given domain.",
        "This FSA serves to guide the collection of human-human interactions necessary to train the classifier ; to verify and if necessary to adjust the system's predicted answer ; and to support the generation of the exercise provided in the form-focused dialog engine."

        "To support focused dialog and promote robustness, we make use of the FSA depicted in Figure 2.",
        "This FSA models a generic sequence of (System Question, Learner Answer, System Reaction) turns instantiating 4 main question/answer patterns and two possible system reactions.",
        "The system question systematically formulates a question which explicitly lists a set of possible answers.",
        "The learner's answer is then classified into four main types.",
        "It selects one of the proposed answers ; it chooses another alternative not mentioned in the system's question ; it indicates that the learner does not know the correct answer or does not understand the question ; or it meets neither of these categories.",
        "Finally, for each answer, the system can continue the dialogue by making a ?confirmation?",
        "which is used to reassure the learner in the free dialogue system and to provide some feedback in the guided dialogue system ; or just by ?informing?",
        "to the learner of the correct answer before getting into the next question.",
        "Given a specific domain, this generic FSA is",
        "instantiated differently for each question/answer pair making up a dialog.",
        "In particular, in the current demonstration system, it is instantiated to model a dialog situated in the kitchen of a virtual world.",

        "Given an FSA specifiying a set of 5 questions the learner had to answer, the wizard guided the learner through the dialog using this FSA.",

        "The free answer dialogue system simulates the behavior of the wizard tutor by means of a Logistic-Regression classifier, the FSA and a generation-by-selection algorithm.",
        "The system first uses the FSA to determine the next question to be asked.",
        "Then for each question, the Logistic-Regression classifier is used to map the learner answer to a system dialog act.",
        "At this stage, the FSA is used again, in two different ways.",
        "First, it is used to ensure that the predicted system dialog act is consistent with the states in the FSA.",

        "In particular, unpredicted ?preferred options?",
        "and ?do not know?",
        "learner answers are detected using keyword spotting methods.",
        "If the classifier prediction conflicts with the prediction made by key word spotting, it is ignored and the FSA transition is prefereed.",
        "Second, since the system has several consecutive turns, and given that the classifier only predicts the next one, the FSA is used to determine the following system dialog acts sequence.",
        "For instance, if the predicted next system dialog act was ?confirm?, according to the FSA the following system dialog act is ?inform?",
        "and then eiher the next question encoded in the FSA or ?quit?.",
