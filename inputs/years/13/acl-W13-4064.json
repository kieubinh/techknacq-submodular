        "While there have been commercial solutions and toolkits for a number of years, there were a number of problems in getting these systems to work.",
        "For example, early toolkits relied on specific machine hardware, software, and firmware to function properly, often had a difficult installation process, and moreover often didn't work well for complex dialogue domains, or challenging acoustic environments.",
        "Fortunately the situation has greatly improved in recent years.",
        "Now there are a number of easy to use solutions, including open-source systems (like PocketSphinx), as well as cloud-based approaches.",
        "While this increased choice of quality recognizers is of great benefit to dialogue system developers, it also creates a dilemma ?",
        "which recognizer to use?",
        "Unfortunately, the answer is not simple ?",
        "it depends on a number of issues, including the type of dialogue domain, availability and amount of training data, availability of internet connectivity for the runtime system, and speed of response needed.",
        "In this paper we assess several freely available speech recognition engines, and examine their suitability and performance in several dialogue systems.",
        "Here we extend the work done in Yao et al. (2010) focusing in particular on cloud based freely available ASR systems.",

        "The following are some of the major criteria for selection of a speech recognizer.",
        "Customization Some of the available speech recognizers allow the users to tune the recognizer to the environment it will operate in, by providing a specialized lexicon, trained language models or acoustic models.",
        "Customization is especially important for dialogue systems whose input contains specialized vocabulary (see section 4).",
        "Output options A basic recognizer will output a string of text, representing its best hypothesis about the transcription of the speech input.",
        "Some recognizers offer additional outputs which are useful for dialogue systems: ranked n-best hypotheses allow later processing to use context for disambiguation, and incremental results allow the system to react while the user is still speaking.",
        "Performance characteristics Dialogue systems differ in their requirements for response speed; a",
        "speech recognizer that runs locally can help by avoiding network latencies.",
        "Output quality Typically, a dialogue system would want the best recognition accuracy possible given the constraints.",
        "Ultimately, dialogue systems want the output that would yield the best performance for Natural Language Understanding and other downstream processes.",
        "As a rule, better speech recognition leads to better language understanding, though this is not necessarily the case for specific applications (see section 5).",
        "We evaluated 5 freely available speech recognizers.",
        "Their features are summarized in Table 1.",
        "We did not include the MIT WAMI toolkit1 as we are focused on speech services that can directly be used by stand alone applications as opposed to web delivered ones.",
        "We did not include commercial recognizers such as Nuance, because licensing terms can be difficult for research institutions, and in particular, disallow publishing benchmarks.",
        "Pocketsphinx is a version of the CMU Sphinx ASR system optimized to run also on embedded systems (Huggins-Daines et al., 2006).",
        "Pocketsphinx is fast, runs locally, and requires relatively modest computational resources.",
        "It provides n-best lists and lattices, and supports incremental output.",
        "It also provides a voice activity detection functionality for continuous ASR.",
        "This ASR is fully customizable and trainable, but users are expected to provide language models suitable for their applications.",
        "A few acoustic models are provided, and can be adapted using the CMUSphinx",
        "MacOSX and iOS.3 It is integrated into the text input system pipeline so a user can replace her keyboard with a microphone for entering text in any application.",
        "Dictation is often associated with the Siri personal assistant feature of iOS.",
        "While it is likely that Dictation and Siri share the same ASR technology, Dictation only does speech recognition.",
        "Apple states that Dictation learns the characteristics of the user's voice and adapts to her accent (Apple Inc, 2012).",
        "Dictation requires an internet connection to send recorded user speech to Apple's servers and receive ASR results.",
        "Processing starts as soon as the user starts speaking so the delay of getting the recognition results after the user finishes speaking is minimal.",
        "To integrate Dictation into a dialogue system, a system designer needs to include any system defined text input control into her application and use the control APIs to observe text changes.",
        "The user would need to press a key when starting to speak and push the key again once she is done speaking.",
        "The ASR result is a text string annotated with alternative interpretations of individual words or phrases in the text.",
        "There is an API for extracting those interpretations from the result.",
        "While the Dictation feature is reasonably fast and easy to integrate, dialogue system developers have no control over the ASR process, which must be treated as a black box.",
        "Apple dictation is limited in that no customization is possible, no partial recognition results are provided, and there is an unspecified limit on the number of utterances dictated for a period of time, which is not a problem for interaction between a single user and a dialogue system, but may be an issue in dialogue systems that support multiple concurrent users.",
        "Google Speech API provides support for the HTML 5 speech input feature.4 It is a cloud based service in which a user submits audio data using an HTML POST request and receives as reply the ASR output in the form of an n-best list.",
        "The audio data is limited to roughly 10 seconds in length, longer clips are rejected and return no ASR results.",
        "The user can (1) customize the number of hypotheses returned by the ASR, (2) specify which language the audio file contains and (3) enable a filter to remove profanities from the output text.",
        "As is the case with Apple Dictation, ASR must be treated as a black box, and no task customization is possible for dialogue system developers.",
        "Users cannot specify or provide custom language models or acoustic models.",
        "The service returns only the final hypothesis, there is no incremental output.5 In addition, results for the same inputs may change unpredictably, since Google may update or otherwise change its service and models, and models may be adapted using specific audio data supplied by users.",
        "In our experiments, we observed accuracy improvements when submitting the same audio files over repeated trials over two weeks.",
        "AT&T Watson is the ASR engine available through the AT&T Speech Mashup service.6 It is a cloud based service that can be accessed through HTML POST requests, like the Google Speech API.",
        "AT&T Watson is designed to support the demands of online spoken dialogue systems, and can be customized with data specific to a dialogue system.",
        "Additionally, in our tests we did not observe any limitation in the maximum length of the input audio data.",
        "However, AT&T does not provide a default general-purpose language model, and application-specific models must be built within the Speech Mashup service using user-provided text data.",
        "The acoustic model must be selected from a list provided by the AT&T service, and acoustic models can be further customized within the Speech Mashup service.",
        "The ASR returns an n-best list of hypotheses but does not provide incremental output.",

        "Will audio from the system confuse the ASR?",
        "Push to talk or continuous speech Will the user clearly identify the start and end of speech, or will the system need to detect speech acoustically?",

        "This genre allows modeling dialogue at a surface-text level (Gandhe, 2013), without internal semantic representations of the input, and where the result of ?understanding?",

        "Advanced Question-answering This genre is similar to the simple question-answering characters, in that the main task of the user is to elicit information from the system character.",
        "The difference is that there is more long-range and intermediate dialogue coherence, in that questions can be answered several utterances after they have been asked, there can be intervening sub-dialogues, and characters sometimes take the initiative to pursue their own goals rather than just responding to the user.",
        "Because of the requirements for somewhat deeper understanding, and relation of input to con",
        "text and character goals and policies, there is a need of at least a shallow semantic representation and representation of the dialogue information state, and the character must distinguish understanding of the input from the character output (since the latter will depend on the dialogue policy and information state, not just the understanding of input).",
        "The tactical questioning architecture (Gandhe et al., 2009)10 provides authoring and runtime support for advanced question-answering characters, and has been used to build over a dozen characters for purposes such as training tactical questioning, training culture, and psychology experiments (Gandhe et al., 2011).",

        "Slot-filling Probably the most common type of dialogue system (at least in the research community) is slot-filling.",

        "and possibly confirm the needed slots, before retrieving some information from a database, or performing a simple service.11 This genre also requires a semantic representation, at least of the slots and acceptable values.",
        "Generally, the set of possible values is large enough, that some form of NLG is needed (at least template filling), rather than authoring of all full sentences.",
        "There are a number of toolkits and development frameworks that are well suited to slot-filling systems, e.g. Ravenclaw (Bohus and Rudnicky, 2003) or Trindikit (Larsson and Traum, 2000).",

        "This allows any multiclass classification algorithm to be used for NLU.",
        "A possible drawback is that for some inputs, the right output might not be available in the set considered by the training data, even if it might easily be constructed from known parts using a generative approach.",
        "A second issue is that even though we can cast the problem as multi-class classification, classification accuracy is not always the most appropriate metric of NLU quality.",
        "For question-answering characters, getting an appropriate and relevant reply is more important than picking the exact reply selected by a human domain designer or annotator: there might be multiple good answers, or even the best available answer might not be very good.",
        "For that reason, the question-answering characters allow an ?off-topic?",
        "answer and Error-return plots (Artstein, 2011) might be necessary to choose an optimal threshold.",
        "For the SASO-EN system, slot-filler metrics such as precision, recall, and f-score are more appropriate than frame accu",
        "racy, because some frames may have many slots in common and few that are different (e.g. just a different addressee).",
        "Nonetheless, we begin our analysis within this common framework.",
        "For simplicity, we start with just three domains: Twins, Amani, and SASO-EN.",
        "SGT STAR and Blackwell are very similar to Twins in terms of NLU.",
        "Radiobots is more challenging to coerce to multiclass classification.",
        "Conventional wisdom in the speech and language processing community is that performance of ASR and NLU are closely tied: improved speech recognition leads to better language understanding, while deficiencies in speech recognition cause difficulty in understanding.",
        "This conventional wisdom is borne out by decades of experience with speech and dialogue systems, though we are not aware of attempts to systematically demonstrate it.",
        "The present study shows that the expected relation between speech recognition and language understanding holds for the systems we tested.",
        "Accepted assumptions about the relation between speech recognition and language understanding have been repeatedly challenged.",
        "Direct challenges are typically limited to specific applications.",
        "Wang et al. (2003) show that for a slot-filling NLU, ASR can be specifically tuned to recognize those words that are relevant to the slot-filling task, resulting in improved understanding despite a decrease in performance on overall word recognition.",
        "However, Boros et al. (1996) found that when not optimizing the ASR for the specific slot filling task there is a nearly linear correlation between word accuracy and NLU accuracy.",
        "Al-shawi (2003) and Huang and Cox (2006) show that in call-routing applications the word level can be dispensed with altogether and calls routed based on phonetic information alone without noticeable loss in performance.",
        "These challenges suggest that the speech-language divide is not as clean as the theory suggests.",
        "To investigate the relation between ASR and NLU, we ran each ASR output from each of the 5 recognizers through an understanding component to obtain an NLU output (each dataset had a separate NLU component, which was held constant for all speech recognizers).",
        "ASR and NLU performance are conventionally measured on scales of opposite polarity: better performance shows up as lower word error rates but higher NLU accuracies.",
        "For the correlations we invert the conventional ASR scale and use word accuracy, so that higher numbers signify better performance on both scales.13 Figure 1 shows the results obtained in the 3 dialogue systems by the various ASR systems.",
        "The figures plot ASR performance against NLU performance; NLU results on manual transcriptions are included for comparison.",
        "There are too few data points for the correlations between ASR and NLU performance to be significant, but the trends are positive, as expected.",
        "Our experiments lend supporting evidence to the claim that in general, ASR performance is positively linked to NLU performance (special cases notwithstanding).",
        "The 3 datasets exhibit positive correlations between speech recognition and language understanding performance.",
        "Thus, we claim that the basis of the conventional wisdom is sound: speech recognition directly affects language understanding.",
        "This conclusion holds when the speech recognizer has been optimized to produce the most accurate transcript, rather than for a specific NLU."

        "We have extended here the ASR system evaluation published in Yao et al. (2010) including some new cloud based ASR services that achieve very good performance showing an improvement of around 12%.",
        "We also showed that ASR and NLU performance are correlated.",
        "One possible avenue of future work is to extract importance weights for each word from the learnt NLU models and use these weights to try to explain those cases that diverge from the correlation between ASR and NLU performance.",
        "This may also give us a better measure than WER for assessing ASR performance in dialogue systems.",
        "Another avenue of future work involves examining different types of NLU engines, and different metrics for the different dialogue system genres, which, again, may lead to a more relevant assessment of ASR performance."
