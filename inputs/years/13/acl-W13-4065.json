        "Dialog state tracking is difficult because automatic speech ?Most of the work for the challenge was performed when the second and third authors were with Honda Research Institute, Mountain View, CA, USA recognition (ASR) and spoken language understanding (SLU) errors are common, and can cause the system to misunderstand the user's needs.",
        "At the same time, state tracking is crucial because the system relies on the estimated dialog state to choose actions ?",
        "for example, which bus schedule information to present to the user.",
        "Most commercial systems use hand-crafted heuristics for state tracking, selecting the SLU result with the highest confidence score, and discarding alternatives.",

        "statistical approaches can overcome some SLU errors.",
        "Numerous techniques for dialog state tracking have been proposed, including heuristic scores (Higashinaka et al., 2003), Bayesian networks (Paek and Horvitz, 2000; Williams and Young, 2007), kernel density estimators (Ma et al., 2012), and discriminative models (Bohus and Rudnicky, 2006).",
        "Techniques have been fielded which scale to realistically sized dialog problems and operate in real time (Young et al., 2010; Thomson and Young, 2010; Williams, 2010; Mehta et al., 2010).",
        "In end-to-end dialog systems, dialog state tracking has been shown to improve overall system performance (Young et al., 2010; Thomson and Young, 2010).",
        "Despite this progress, direct comparisons between methods have not been possible because past studies use different domains and system components, for speech recognition, spoken language understanding, dialog control, etc.",

      "text": [
        "First, we define the dialog state tracking problem.",
        "A dialog state tracker takes as input all of the observable elements up to time t in a dialog, including all of the results from the automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spoken language understanding (SLU) components, and external knowledge sources such as bus timetable databases and models of past dialogs.",
        "It also takes as input a set of Nt possible dialog state hypotheses, where a hypothesis is an assignment of values to slots in the system.",
        "The tracker outputs a probability distribution over the set of Nt hypotheses, and the meta-hypothesis REST which indicates that none of them are correct.",
        "The goal is to assign probability 1.0 to the correct state, and 0.0 to other states.",
        "Note that the set of dialog states is given.",
        "Also note that Nt varies with t ?",
        "typically as the dialog progresses and more concepts are discussed, the number of candidate hypotheses increases.",
        "An example is given in Figure 1.",
        "In this challenge, dialog states are generated in the usual way, by enumerating all slots values that have appeared in the SLU N-best lists or system output up until the current turn.",
        "While this approach precludes a tracker assigning a score to an",
        "SLU value that has not been observed, the cardinality of the slots is generally large, so the likelihood of a tracker correctly guessing a slot value which hasn't been observed anywhere in the input or output is vanishingly small."

      "heading": "2.2 Challenge design",
      "text": [
        "The dialog state tracking challenge studies this problem as a corpus-based task ?",
        "i.e., dialog state trackers are trained and tested on a static corpus of dialogs, recorded from systems using a variety of state tracking models and dialog managers.",
        "The challenge task is to rerun state tracking on these dialogs ?",
        "i.e., to take as input the runtime system logs including the SLU results and system output, and to output scores for dialog states formed from the runtime SLU results.",
        "This corpus-based design was chosen because it allows different trackers to be evaluated on the same data, and because a corpus-based task has a much lower barrier to entry for research groups than building an end-to-end dialog system.",
        "In practice of course, a state tracker will be used in an end-to-end dialog system, and will drive action selection, thereby affecting the distribution of the dialog data the tracker experiences.",
        "In other words, it is known in advance that the distribution in the training data and live data will be mismatched, although the nature and extent of the mismatch are not known.",
        "Hence, unlike much of supervised learning research, drawing train and test data from the same distribution in offline experiments may overstate performance.",
        "So in the DSTC, train/test mismatch was explicitly created by choosing test data to be from different dialog systems."

        "The goal was to provide bus riders with bus timetable information.",
        "For example, a caller might want to find out the time of the next bus leaving from Downtown to the airport.",
        "The SDC received dialog systems from three different research groups, here called Groups A, B, and C. Each group used its own ASR, SLU, and dialog manager.",
        "The dialog strategies across groups varied considerably: for example, Groups A and C used a mixed-initiative design, where the system could recognize any concept at any turn, but Group B used a directed design, where the system asked for concepts sequentially and could only recognize the concept being queried.",
        "Groups trialled different system variants over a period of almost 3 years.",
        "These variants differed in acoustic and language models, confidence scoring model, state tracking method and parameters, number of supported bus routes, user population, and presence of minor bugs.",
