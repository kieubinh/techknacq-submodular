        "During the last decades, we have seen a tremendous increase in the number of syntactic parsers available for different languages, often enabled by the development of syntactically annotated corpora, or treebanks.",
        "The added linguistic diversity has highlighted the fact that typological differences between languages lead to new challenges, both in parsing technology and treebank annotation.",
        "In particular, it has been observed repeatedly that richly inflected languages, which often also exhibit relatively free word order, usually obtain lower parsing accuracy, especially compared to English (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007).",
        "This has led to a special interest in parsing methods for such languages (Tsarfaty et al., 2010; Tsarfaty et al., 2013).",
        "In this paper, we contribute to the growing pool of empirical evidence by presenting the first statistical dependency parsing results for Lithuanian, a morphologically rich Baltic language characterized as one of the most archaic living Indo-European languages (Gimbutas, 1963).",
        "Using the newly developed Lithuanian Treebank, we train and evaluate a greedy transition-based parser and in particular investigate the impact of rich morphological features on parsing accuracy.",
        "Our experiments show that virtually all morphological features can be beneficial when parsing Lithuanian, which contrasts with many previous studies that have mainly found a positive impact for isolated features such as CASE (Eryigit et al., 2008).",
        "Using all available features, we achieve a labeled attachment score of 74.7 with gold morphology (including part-of-speech tags and lemmas) and 68.1 with predicted morphology.",
        "The corresponding unlabeled attachment scores are 77.8 and 72.8, respectively."

        "MaltParser is a transition-based dependency parser that performs parsing as greedy search through a transition system, guided by a history-based classifier for predicting the next transition (Nivre, 2008).",
        "Although more accurate dependency parsers exist these days, MaltParser appeared suitable for our experiments for a number of reasons.",
        "First of all, greedy transition-based parsers have been shown to perform well with relatively small amounts of training data (Nivre et al., 2006b).",
        "Secondly, MaltParser implements a number of different transition systems and classifiers that can be explored and also supports user-defined input formats and feature specifications in a flexible way.",
        "Finally, MaltParser has already been applied to a wide range of languages, to which the results can be compared.",
        "In particular, MaltParser was used to obtain the only published dependency parsing results for Latvian, the language most closely related to Lithuanian (Pretkalnin.",
        "a and Rituma, 2013).",
        "In our experiments, we use the latest release of MaltParser (Version 1.7.2).4 After preliminary experiments, we decided to use the arc-eager transition system (Nivre, 2003) with pseudo-projective parsing to recover non-projective dependencies (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005) and the LIBLINEAR learning package with multiclass SVMs (Fan et al., 2008).",
        "Table 3 lists the options that were explored in the preliminary experiments.",
        "We first tested all possible combinations of learning method and parsing algorithms and then performed a greedy sequential tuning of the options related to covered roots, pseudo-projective parsing, and all combinations of allow-root and allow-reduce.",

        "nary experiments with best values used in all subsequent experiments.",
        "as a single string and putting it into the FEATS column, which means that there will be one boolean feature for each unique set of features.",
        "However, in order to study the influence of each individual morphological feature, we also prepared an appropriate format where every morphological feature had its own (atom-valued) column (called CASE, GENDER, NUMBER, etc.",
        "), which means that there will be one boolean feature for each unique feature value, as specified in Table 2.",
        "In the following, we will refer to these two versions as Set-FEATS and Atom-FEATS, respectively.",
        "Another choice we had to make was how to treat punctuation, which is not integrated into the dependency structure in the Lithuanian Treebank.",

        "First of all, we may conclude that the Baseline feature model (without morphological information) does not perform very well for a morphologically rich language like Lithuanian (see Figure 4 and Figure 5), despite giving high accuracy for morphologically impoverished languages like English.",
        "However, it is likely that the accuracy of the Baseline model would be a bit higher for the Lithuanian Treebank if PoS tags incorporated some morphological information as they do, for example, in the English Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "It thus seems that basic PoS tags as well as lemmas are too general to be beneficial enough for Lithuanian.",
        "The simple morphemic word form could be more useful (even despite the fact that Lithuanian is syncretic language), but the treebank is currently too small, making the data too sparse to create a robust model.7 Thus, the effective way of dealing with unseen words is by incorporating morphological information.",
        "In the Predicted condition, we always see a drop in accuracy compared to the Gold condition, although our case is not exceptional.",
        "For example, the Baseline model has a drop in LAS of 4.72 percentage points from Gold to Predicted, but this gap could possibly be narrowed by retuning the feature model for the Predicted condition instead of simply reusing the model tuned for the Gold condition.",
        "We also tried training the model on gold annotations for parsing predicted annotations, but these produced even worse results, confirming that it is better to make the training condition resemble the parsing condition.",
        "Despite noisy information, morphological features are still very beneficial compared to not using them at all (see Figure 5).",
        "Our findings thus agree with what has been found for Arabic by Marton et al.",
        "(2013) but seem to contradict the results obtained 7We tried to reduce data sparseness a little bit by changing all words into lowercase, but the drop in accuracy revealed that orthographic information is also important for parsing.",
        "for Hebrew by Goldberg and Elhadad (2010).",
        "As we can see from both curves in Figure 4 and Figure 5, the top contributors are CASE, VOICE, and TENSE, but the CASE feature gives the biggest contribution to accuracy.",
        "It boosts LAS by 6.51 points in the Gold condition and almost 5 points in the Predicted condition, whereas the contribution of all the other morphological features is less than 1 point (and not statistically significant).",
        "In a control experiment we reversed the order in which morphological features are added (presented in Figure 4 and Figure 5), adding CASE at the very end.",
        "In this case, the addition of all features except case resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the Gold condition (p = 0.001) but not in the Predicted condition (p = 0.24).",
        "However, the contribution of CASE was by far the most important again ?",
        "increasing LAS by 5.55 points in the Gold condition and by 4.68 points in the Predicted condition.",
        "To further investigate the selection of morphological features, we also performed a greedy selection experiment.",
        "During this experiment CASE was selected first, again proving it to be the most influential feature.",
        "It was followed by VOICE, MOOD, NUMBER and DEGREE in the Gold condition and by GENDER, TENSE, PERSON and TYPE in the Predicted condition.",
        "Overall, however, greedy selection gave worse results than random selection, achieving 74.42 LAS and 77.60 UAS in the Gold condition and 67.83 LAS and 72.80 UAS in the Predicted condition.",
        "To find that CASE is the most important feature is not surprising, as CASE has been shown to be the most helpful feature for many languages (at least in the Gold condition).",
        "But whereas few other features have been shown to help for other languages, in our case the majority of features (8 out of 12 in the Gold condition) are beneficial for Lithuanian.",
        "The so-called agreement features (GENDER, NUMBER and PERSON) are beneficial for Lithuanian (at least in the Gold condition) as well as for Arabic (Marton et al., 2013), but not such languages as Hindi (Ambati et al., 2010) and Hebrew (Goldberg and Elhadad, 2010).",
        "In the Predicted condition, their positive impact is marginal at best, possibly because NUMBER is very poorly predicted by the morpho",
        "feature models incorporating different attributes; the y axis represents LAS.",
        "The horizontal line at 68.05 represents the LAS of Baseline+FEATS.",
        "logical analyzer.8 It is also worth noting that morphological features have less influence on UAS than LAS, as the gain in UAS over the Baseline is 3-4 percentage points lower compared to LAS.",
        "This means that morphology is more important for selecting the type of dependency than for choosing the syntactic head.",
        "More precisely, adding morphology improves both recall and precision for the labels SBJ and OBJ, which is probably due primarily to the CASE feature.",
        "Despite the positive effect of morphological information, the best LAS achieved is only 74.66 in the Gold condition and 68.05 in the Predicted condition.",
        "An error analysis shows that 38.0% of all LAS errors have an incorrect syntactic head, 12.5% have an incorrect dependency label, and 49.5% have both incorrect.",
        "The most commonly occurring problem is the ambiguity between DEP and ROOT dependencies.",
        "For example, in the sentence atsidu?re?",
        "Vokietijoje, lanke?",
        "paskaitas (he got to Germany, attended lectures) lanke?",
        "(attended) is the dependent of atsidu?re?",
        "(got), because it is the consecutive action performed by the same subject (the subject is expressed implicitly and can be identified according the appropriate verb form).",
        "But in the sentence buvo puiku ir mums, ir jam patiko (it was great for us and he enjoyed it) patiko (enjoyed) is not a dependent of buvo (was) but of the root node, because the sentence contains two separate clauses with their subjects and verbs.9 Other common ambiguities are among different types of labels that are expressed by the same morphological categories and depends on the context (and the meaning) of the sentence, for example, in the phrase uz?z?elti augalais (to green with plants), augalais (plants) is a dependent of uz?z?elti (to green) with the OBJ label; in uz?siimti projektais (to engage in projects) projektais (projects) is a dependent of uz?siimti (to engage) with the MODIF label; and in pavadinti vardais (to name with names) vardais (names) is a dependent on pavadinti (to name) with",

        "In all these cases morphology does not help to determine the particular label of the dependency relation.",
        "Finally, we note that the results obtained for Lithuanian are in the same range as those reported for Latvian, another Baltic language.",
