        "As shown by the remarkable permanence over the years of specialized workshops, multiword expressions (MWEs) identification is still receiving considerable attention.",
        "For some languages, such as Arabic, French, English, or German, a large quantity of MWE resources have been generated (Baldwin and Nam, 2010).",
        "Yet, while special treatment of complex lexical units, such as MWEs, has been shown to boost performance in tasks such as machine translation (Pal et al., 2011), there has been relatively little work exploiting MWE recognition to improve parsing performance.",
        "Indeed, a classical parsing scenario is to pre-group MWEs using gold MWE annotation (Arun and Keller, 2005).",
        "This non-realistic scenario has been shown to help parsing (Nivre and Nilsson, 2004; Eryigit et al., 2011), but the situation is quite different when switching to automatic MWE prediction.",
        "In that case, errors in MWE recognition alleviate their positive effect on parsing performance (Constant et al., 2012).",
        "While the realistic scenario of syntactic parsing with automatic MWE recognition (either done jointly or in a pipeline) has already been investigated in constituency parsing (Caffer-key et al., 2007; Green et al., 2011; Constant et al., 2012; Green et al., 2013), the French dataset of the SPMRL 2013 Shared Task (Seddah et al., 2013) offers one of the first opportunities to evaluate this scenario within the framework of dependency syntax.",
        "In this paper, we discuss the systems we submitted to the SPMRL 2013 shared task.",

        "In the following, we focus on the full training set scenario.",
        "Let us first discuss the overall parsing performance, by looking at the results on the development corpus (table 1).",
        "As far as the single-parser systems are concerned, we can note that for both the joint and pipeline systems, MALT achieves lower performance than the graph-based (Mate-tools-1) and the joint tagger-parser (Mate-tools-2), which have comparable performance.",
        "Moreover, the pipeline systems achieve overall better than their joint counterpart, though the increase between joint and pipeline architecture is much bigger for MALT than for the Mate parsers (for MALT, compare",
        "LAS=80.91 for the joint system, and LAS=82.56 for the pipeline architecture, while for Mate-tools1, compare LAS=84.60 with LAS=85.28).",
        "The best reparser system provides a performance increase of approximately one point over the best single-parser system (Mate-tools-1), both for LAS and UAS, which suggests that the parsers have complementary strengths.",
        "When looking at performance on MWE recognition and tagging (2), we can note greater variation between the F-measures obtained by the single-parser systems, but this is due to the much lower number of MWEs with respect to the number of tokens (there are 38820 tokens and 2119 MWEs in the dev set).",
        "The MWE analyzer used in the pipeline systems leads to better MWE recognition (F ?",
        "measure = 81.2 on dev set) than when the analysis is left to the bare ?joint?",
        "parsers (joint Mate-tools 1 achieves F-measure= 77.3).",
        "Contrary to the situation for overall parsing performance, the reparser system does not lead to better MWE recognition with respect to the MWE analyzer of the pipeline systems.",
        "Indeed the performance on MWEs are quite similar between the reparser system and the MWE analyzer (for the MWE metric, on the dev set we get F=81.0 versus 81.2 for best reparser and pipeline systems respectively, whereas we get 80.7 and 80.8 on the test set.",
        "These differences are not significant).",
        "This is because the MWEs predicted by the MWE analyzer are present in three of the single-parser systems taken into account in the reparsing process, and are thus much favored in the voting.",
        "In order to understand better our parsing systems?",
        "performance on MWE recognition, we provide in table 5 the MWE+POS results broken down by MWE part-of-speech, for the dev set.",
        "Not surprisingly, we can note that performance varies greatly depending on the POS, with better performance on closed classes (conjunctions, determiners, prepositions, pronouns) than on open classes.",
        "The lowest performance is on adjectives and verbs, but given the raw numbers of gold MWEs, the major impact on overall performance is given by the results on nominal MWEs (either common or proper nouns).",
        "A little less than one third of the nominal gold MWEs",
        "of gold MWEs, predicted MWEs, correct MWEs with such POS.",
        "is not recognized (R = 72.7), and about one quarter of the predicted nominal MWEs are wrong (P = 76.2).",
