        "When an NLP application works with a document, it may benefit from knowing something about this document's high-level structure.",
        "Text summarization (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009), question answering (Oh et al., 2007) and information retrieval (Ponte and Croft, 1998) are some of the examples of such applications.",
        "Topical segmentation is a lightweight form of such structural analysis: given a sequence of sentences or paragraphs, split it into a sequence of topical segments, each characterized by a certain degree of topical unity.",
        "This is particularly useful for texts with little structure imposed by the author, such as speech transcripts, meeting notes or literature.",
        "The past decade has witnessed significant progress in the area of text segmentation.",
        "Most of the topical segmenters (Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006; Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008; Kazantseva and Szpakowicz, 2011; Misra et al., 2011; Du et al., 2013) can only produce single-level segmentation, a worthy endeavour in and of itself.",
        "Yet, to view the structure of a document linearly, as a sequence of segments, is in certain discord with most theories of discourse structure, where it is more customary to consider documents as trees (Mann and Thompson, 1988; Marcu, 2000; Hernault et al., 2010; Feng and Hirst, 2012) or graphs (Wolf and Gibson, 2006).",
        "Regardless of the theory, we hypothesize that it may be useful to have an idea about fluctuations of topic in documents beyond the coarsest level.",
        "It is the contribution of this work that we develop such a hierarchical segmenter, implement it and do our best to evaluate it.",
        "The segmenter described here is HAPS ?",
        "Hierarchical Affinity Propagation for Segmentation.",
        "It is closely based on a graphical model for hierarchical clustering called Hierarchical Affinity Propagation (Givoni et al., 2011).",
        "It is a similarity-based segmenter.",
        "It takes as input a matrix of similarities between atomic units of text in the sequence to be segmented (sentences or paragraphs), the desired number of levels in the topical tree and a preference value for each data point and each level.",
        "This value captures a priori belief about how likely it is that this data point is a segment centre at that level.",
        "The preference values also control the granularity of segmentation: how many segments are to be identified at each level.",
        "The output is a topical tree.",
        "For each segment at every level, HAPS also finds a segment centre, a data point which best describes the segment.",
        "37 The objective function maximized by the segmenter is net similarity ?",
        "the sum of similarities between all segment centres and their children for all levels of the tree.",
        "This function is similar to the objective function of the well-known k-means algorithm, except that here it is computed hierarchically.",
        "It is not easy to evaluate HAPS.",
        "We are not aware of comparable hierarchical segmenters other than that in (Eisenstein, 2009) which, unfortunately, is no longer publicly available.",
        "Therefore we compared the trees built by HAPS to the results of running iteratively two state-of-the-art flat segmenters.",
        "The results are compared on two datasets.",
        "A set of Wikipedia articles was automatically compiled by Carroll (2010).",
        "The other set, created to evaluate HAPS, consists of nine chapters from the novel Moonstone by Wilkie Collins.",
        "Each chapter was annotated for hierarchical structure by 3-6 people.",
        "The evaluation is based on two metrics, windowDiff (Pevzner and Hearst, 2002) and evalHDS (Car- roll, 2010).",
        "Both metrics are less then ideal.",
        "They do not give a complete picture of the quality of topical segmentations, but the preliminary results suggest that running a global model for hierarchical segmentation produces better results then iteratively running flat segmenters.",
        "Compared to the baseline segmenters, HAPS has an important practical advantage.",
        "It does not require the number of segments as an input; this requirement is customary for most flat segmenters.",
        "We also made a rough attempt to evaluate the quality of the segment centres identified by HAPS.",
        "Using 20 chapters from several novels of Jane Austen, we compared the centres identified for each chapter against summaries produces by a recent automatic summarizer CohSum (Smith et al., 2012).",
        "The basis of comparison was the ROUGE metric (Lin, 2004).",
        "While far from conclusive, the results suggest that segment centres identified by HAPS are rather comparable with the summaries produced by an automatic summarizer.",
        "A Java implementation of HAPS and the corpus of hierarchical segmentations for nine chapters of Moonstone are publicly available.",
        "We consider these to be the main contributions of this research.",
        "2 Related work Most work on topical text segmentation has been done for single-level segmentation.",
        "Contemporary approaches usually rely on the idea that topic shifts can be identified by finding shifts in the vocabulary (Youmans, 1991).",
        "We can distinguish between local and global models for topical text segmentation.",
        "Local algorithms have a limited view of the document.",
        "For example, TextTiling (Hearst, 1997) operates by sliding a window through the input sequence and computing similarity between adjacent units.",
        "By identifying ?valleys?",
        "in similarities, TextTiling identifies topic shifts.",
        "More recently, Marathe (2010) used lexical chains and Blei and Moreno (2001) used Hidden Markov Models.",
        "Such methods are usually very fast, but can be thrown off by small digressions in the text.",
        "Among global algorithms, we can distinguish generative probabilistic models and similarity-based models.",
        "Eisenstein and Barzilay (2008) model a document as a sequence of segments generated by latent topic variables.",
        "Misra et al. (2011) and Du et al. (2013) have similar models.",
        "Malioutov and Barzilay (2006) and (Kazantseva and Szpakowicz, 2011) use similarity-based representations.",
        "Both algorithms take as input a matrix of similarities between sentences of the input document; the former uses graph cuts to find cohesive segments, while the latter modifies a clustering algorithm to perform segmentation.",
        "Research on hierarchical segmentation has been more scarce.",
        "Yaari (1997) produced hierarchical segmentation by agglomerative clustering.",
        "Eisenstein (2009) used a Bayesian model to create topical trees, but the system is regrettably no longer publicly available.",
        "Song et al. (2011) develop an algorithm for hierarchical segmentation which iteratively splits a document in two at a place where cohesion links are the weakest.",
        "A second pass transforms a deep binary tree into a shallow and broad structure.",
        "Any flat segmenter can certainly be used iteratively to create trees of segments by subdividing each segment, but this may be problematic.",
        "Topical segmenters are not perfect, so running them iteratively is likely to compound the error.",
        "Most segmenters also require the number of segments as an input.",
        "This estimate is feasible for flat segmentation.",
        "To know in advance the number of segments and sub-segments at each level is not a realistic requirement when building a tree.",
        "This work describes a hierarchical model of text segmentation.",
        "It takes a global view of the document and of the topical hierarchy.",
        "Each iteration attempts to find the best assignment of segments for the 38 whole tree.",
        "It does not need to know the exact number of segments.",
        "Instead, it takes a more abstract parameter, preference values, to specify the granularity of segmentation at each level.",
        "For each segment it also outputs a segment centre, a unit of text which best captures the contents of the segment.",
        "3 Creating a corpus of hierarchical segmentations Before embarking on the task of building a hierarchical segmenter, we wanted to study how people perform such a task.",
        "We also needed a benchmark corpus which could be used to evaluate the quality of segmentations produced by HAPS.",
        "To this end, we annotated nine chapters of the novel Moonstone for hierarchical structure.",
        "We settled on these data because it is a subset of a publicly available dataset for flat segmentation (Kazantseva and Szpakowicz, 2012).",
        "In our study, each chapter was annotated by 3-6 people (4.8 on average).",
        "The annotators, undergraduate students of English, were paid $50 dollars each.",
        "Procedure.",
        "The instructions asked the annotator to read the chapter and split it into top-level segments according to where there is a perceptible shift of topic.",
        "She had to provide a one-sentence description of what the segment is about.",
        "The procedure had to be repeated for each segment all the way down to the level of individual paragraphs.",
        "Effectively, the annotators were building a detailed hierarchical outline for each chapter.",
        "Metrics.",
        "Two different metrics helped estimate the quality of our hierarchical dataset: windowDiff (Pevzner and Hearst, 2002) and S (Fournier and Inkpen, 2012).",
        "windowDiff is computed by sliding a window across the input sequence and checking, for each window position, whether the number of reference breaks is the same as the number of breaks in the hypothetical segmentation.",
        "The number of erroneous windows is then normalized by the total number of windows.",
        "In Equation 1, N is the length of the input sequence and k is the size of the sliding window.",
        "windowDiff = 1 N ?",
        "k N?k ?",
        "i=1 (|ref ?",
        "hyp| 6= 0) (1) windowDiff is designed to compare sequences of segments, not trees.",
        "That is why we compute it for each level between each pair of annotators who worked on the same chapter.",
        "It should be noted that windowDiff is a penalty metric: higher values indicate less agreement (windowDiff= 0 corresponds to two identical segmentations).",
        "The S metric allows us to compare trees and take into account situations when the segmenter places a boundary at a correct position but at a wrong level.",
        "S is an edit-distance metric.",
        "It computes the number of operations necessary to turn one segmentation into another.",
        "There are three types of editing operations: add/delete, transpose and substitute (change the level in the tree).",
        "The sum is normalized by the number of possible boundaries in the sequence.",
        "S has an unfortunate downside of being too optimistic, but it allows the breakdown of error types and it explicitly compares trees.",
        "Unlike windowDiff, S is a similarity metric: higher values correspond to more similar segmentations.",
        "The value of S between two identical segmentations is 1.",
        "S(bs a , bs b , n) = 1?",
        "|boundary distance(bs a , bs b , n)| pb(D) (2) Here boundary distance(bs a , bs b , n) is the total number of edit operations needed to turn a segmentation bs a into bs b , n is the threshold defining the maximum distance of transpositions.",
        "pb(D) is the maximum possible number of edits.",
        "Segmentations bs a and bs a are represented as strings of sets of boundary positions.",
        "For example bs a = ({2}, {1,2}, {1,2}) corresponds to a hierarchical segmentation of a three-unit sequence in the following manner: a segment boundary at level 1 after the first unit, segment boundaries at levels 1 and 2 after the second unit and the third unit.",
        "Corpus Analysis.",
        "On average, the annotators took 3.5 hours to complete the task (?",
        "= 1.6).",
        "The average depth of the tree is 3.00 levels (?",
        "= 0.65), suggesting that the annotators prefer shallow but broad structures.",
        "Table 1 reports the average breadth of the tree at different levels.",
        "In the Table and further 39 in this paper we refer to the bottom level of the tree (i.e., the leaves of the tree or the most fine-grained level of segmentation) as level 1.",
        "In Table 1, level 4 refers to the top level of the tree (the coarsest segmentations).",
        "The values were computed using only the breaks explicitly specified by the annotators (i.e., we did not assume that a break at a coarse level implies a break at a more detailed level).",
        "The average breadth of the trees at the bottom (level 1) is lower than that at level 2, indicating that only a small percentage of the entire tree was annotated more than three levels deep.",
        "The table also shows the average values of windowDiff computed for each possible pair of annotators.",
        "The values worsen toward the bottom of the tree, suggesting that the annotators agree more about top-level segments and less and less about finer fluctuations of topic.",
        "We hypothesize that these shallow broad structures are due to the fact that it is difficult for people to create deep recursive structures in their mental representations.",
        "We do not, however, have any hard data to support this hypothesis.",
        "Many of the annotators specifically commented on the difficulty of the task.",
        "9 out of 23 people included comments ranging from notes about specific places to general comments about their lack of confidence.",
        "4 annotators found several (specific) passages they had trouble with.",
        "The average value of pairwise S is 0.79.",
        "We have noted earlier that the S metric tends to be optimistic (that is due to its normalization factor) but it provides a breakdown of disagreements between the annotators.",
        "According to S, 46.14% of disagreements are errors of omission (some of the annotators did not include segment breaks where others did), 47.56% are disagreements about the level of segmentation (the annotators placed boundaries in the same place but at different levels) and only 6.31% are errors of transposition (the annotators do not agree about the exact placement but place boundaries within 1 position of each other).",
        "This distribution is more interesting than the overall value of S. Among other things, it shows why it is so important to take into account adjacent levels when evaluating topical trees.",
        "4 The HAPS algorithm 1 4.1 Factor graphs The HAPS segmenter is based on factor graphs, a unifying formalism for such graphical models as Markov or Bayesian networks.",

        "BSeg performs slightly better at the bottom levels of the tree when it has the information about the exact number of segments.",
        "We hypothesize that the advantage may be due to this additional information, especially when segmenting already small segments at level 1 into a predefined number of segments.",
        "Another explanation may be that when using windowDiff as the evaluation metric, HAPS was fine-tuned so as to maximize the value of windowDiff at the top level, effectively disregarding lower levels of segmentation.",
        "4 When working with the Moonstone dataset, we realized that the software produces very low values, almost too good to be true.",
        "That is because the bottommost annotations are very fine-grained.",
        "Sometimes each paragraph corresponds to a separate segment.",
