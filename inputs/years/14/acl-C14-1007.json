        "tweets can be integrated into the same discourse context.",
        "To this end, features like reply relation, authorship, temporal proximity, continuation markers, and discourse markers were used to build models for detecting serialization.",
        "According to our experiments, each one of the suggested serializing methods achieves higher means of average precision rates than baselines such as the query matching model and the tf-idf weighting model, which indicates that considering an individual tweet within a discourse context is helpful in judging its relevance to a given topic."

        "1.1 Limits of the Twitter Query-Matching Search Twitter search was not a very crucial thing in the past (Stone, 2009a), at least for users in its early stages who read and wrote tweets only within their curated timelines real-time (Dorsey, 2007; Stone, 2009b; Stone, 2009c).",
        "Users?",
        "personal interests became one of the motivations to explore a large body of tweets only after commercial, political and academic demands, but it triggered the current extension of the Twitter search service.",
        "The domain of Twitter search was widened, for example, from tweets in the recent week to older ones (Burstein, 2013), and from accounts that have a specific term in their name or username to those that are relevant to that particular subject (Stone, 2007; Stone, 2008; Twitter, 2011; Kozak, Novermber 19, 2013).",
        "However, the standard Twitter search mechanism is based only on the presence of query terms.",
        "Even though the Twitter Search API provides many operators, the current query matching search does not guarantee retrieving a complete list of all relevant tweets.",
        "12 The 140-character limit sometimes forces a tweet not to contain a term, not because of its lack of relevance to the topic represented by the term, but due to one of the following: Reduction the query term is written in an abbreviated form or in form of Internet slang, Expansion the query term is in external text that can be expanded through other services such as TwitLonger (http://twitlonger.com) and twtkr (http://twtkr.olleh.com), while the part exceeding 140 characters is shown only as a link on twitter.com, or Serialization the query term is contained as an antecedent in some previous tweet.",

        "GET search/tweets https: //dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/search/tweets 58 If these cases are frequent enough, the current query matching search in Twitter will get a low recall rate.",
        "Considering that tweets are usually used to obtain as various views on a topic as possible, in addition to accurate and reliable information about it, this setback would block attempts to collect diverse opinions in Twitter.",
        "These three different cases require different approaches.",
        "First, reduction, one of the most significant characteristics of Twitter data in natural language processing, can be solved by building a dictionary of Internet slang terms or learning them.",
        "Second, in case of expansion tweets are always accompanied with short URLs (http://tl.gd for TwitLonger and http://dw.am for twtkr) and the full text is reachable through them.",
        "In these two cases, tweets correspond one-on-one with documents, whether reduced internally or expanded externally.",
        "This study will focus on the third case, serialization, where several tweets may be interpreted as a single document.",
        "1.2 Serialization of Tweets: An Overlooked Aspect of Twitter Though little reported before, serialization of tweets is frequently observed in Korean data.",
        "3 Influential users like famous journalists, columnists and critics as well as ordinary users often publish multiple tweets over a short period of time instead of using other media such as blogs or web magazines.",
        "Types of tweets published in this way by Korean users include reports, reviews, and analysis on political or social affairs, news articles, books, films and dramas.",
        "The content users intend to express is longer than a tweet but shorter than a typical blog post.",
        "Examples from our dataset will be introduced in Section 3.",
        "This study aims at retrieving tweets on a topic, which cannot be found by the current query-matching system.",
        "Such tweets are relevant to a given query but do not contain the necessary words.",
        "Under the hypothesis that a considerable number of these tweets not containing the query term are serialized with one containing it overtly, and that serialized segments are integrated into the same discourse context, we built a model that allows us, when given a tweet that includes a query or a mentioned topic, to find the other tweets serialized with it and count them as relevant to the topic.",
        "We primarily focused on Korean Twitter data, but we believe that the methods developed here are also applicable to other languages with similar phenomena.",
        "2 Previous Studies Our study is based on the observation that a tweet in a ?serialization?",
        "does not necessarily correspond to a full document.",
        "In fact, it has already been reported (Hong and Davison, 2010; Weng et al., 2010; Mehrotra et al., 2013) that a single tweet is too short to be treated as an individual document, especially considering that word co-occurrence in a tweet is hardly found.",
        "Studies proved that performance of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models for Twitter topic discovery can be improved by aggregating tweets into a document.",
        "In these studies, a ?document ?",
        "consists either of all tweets under the same authorship (Hong and Davison, 2010; Weng et al., 2010), all tweets published in a particular period, or all tweets sharing a hashtag (Mehrotra et al., 2013).",
        "These criteria are useful for finding topics, into which tweets can be classified, but our purpose requires a different degree of ?documentness.?",
        "Our study deals with a fixed topic and is interested in whether or not only tweets relevant to the topic can be pooled.",
        "All tweets merged into the same document as constructed in the previous studies are not necessarily coherent or related to the same topic because it is not usually expected that ordinary users devote their Twitter accounts to a single topic.",
        "In this study, we will develop more detailed criteria for the aggregation of tweets by combining authorship with time intervals and adopting features such as sentiment consistency and discourse markers.",
        "A method of using discourse markers for microblog data was proposed by Mukherjee and Bhattacharyya (2012).",
        "They noted that a dependency parser, on which opinion analyses using discourse information (Somasundaran, 2010) are usually based, is inadequate for small microblog data, and instead used a ?lightweight?",
        "discourse analysis, considering the existence of a discourse marker on each tweet.",
        "The list of discourse markers used in their study was based on the list of conjunctions representing discourse relations presented by Wolf et al. (2004).",
        "This method was successful for sentiment 3 Some Korean users sarcastically call this a ?saga?",
        "of tweets.",
        "59 analysis on Twitter data assuming that the relevance of each tweet to a certain topic was already known.",
        "We will take a similar approach of using discourse markers, but with a different assumption and for a different purpose.",
        "In our study, we treat unknown topic relevance of tweets with missing query terms by aggregating them with a topic-marked tweet using discourse markers.",
        "3 Features 3.1 Properties of Tweet Serialization Multiple tweets are likely to be consistent with a topic if they form a discourse as in the following situations, with examples of tweets in Korean translated into English.",
        "In each tweet, topic words are in boldface.",
        "Conversation This is the most typical case.",
        "U1: Wow the neighborhood theater is packed; will Snowpiercer hit ten million?",
        "U2: @U1 My parents and my boss are all gonna watch, and they watch only one film a year.",
        "This is the measure for ten million.",

        "Jung Sung-Il U3 Master Jung's sarcasm........?",
        "On-the-spot addition Because a published tweet cannot be edited, users can elaborate or correct it only by writing a new tweet or deleting the existing tweet.",
        "U5 Is Curtis the epitome of Director Bong's 4 sinserity U5 Sincerity, shit True (intentional) serialization Some users begin to write tweets with a text of more than 140 characters in mind.",
        "They arrive at the length limit and continue to write in a new tweet.",
        "U6 (1) Watched Snowpiercer.",
        "It was more interesting than I thought.",
        "It felt more like black comedy than SF.",
        "On another note, I was surprised by several oddities, making the film feel more like a Korean film with foreign actors in it rather than Director Bong's Hollywood debut.",
        "U6 (2) In many ways the film was ?nineties?...",
        "like watching The City of Lost Children all over again... and the trip from the tail-car to the first car, though I expected some kind of level-up for each car, U6 (3) the world connected car to car was not an organic world (a sideways pyramid?)",
        "but worlds too separate car by car, and the front-car people were so lifeless that I was surprised.",
        "The scale of the ?charge?",
        "after 17 years felt shrunken.",
        "If this is a characteristic feature of Korean Twitter data, this may be due to reasons such as personal writing style, the writing system of the Korean language, and Korean Web platforms.",
        "First, it may be simply because these users prefer formal language and are reluctant to use short informal expressions even in Web writing.",
        "Second, it is possibly because CJK writing systems including Hangul, the Korean alphabet, have more information per character than the Roman alphabet (Neubig and Duh, 2013).",
        "Since a 140-character text in Hangul has generally more information than that in the Roman alphabet, a Korean (or Japanese) user can more readily tweet about content which an English (or other European) language user would consider too long to write about on Twitter.",
        "Third, for many Korean users Twitter is the most available medium for publishing their opinions online, as a number of standard blogs have been replaced 4 Director of the film Snowpiercer 60 by microblogs.",
        "Some users divide a long public text into multiple length-limited tweets simply because they do not have a blog to write in.",
        "While Internet slang and abbreviations are common in tweets, ?Serializers?",
        "tend to use 1) fully-spelled forms (unlike ?reducers?",
        "), 2) usually without hashtags and emoticons, 3) which are all visible on twitter.com itself (unlike ?expanders?",
        "), so it is not guaranteed that all serialized tweets will contain the topic word, as in the examples above.",
        "This implies that some tweet segments in a single discourse may not be retrieved even if the discourse is relevant to a given query.",
        "Search results may include a partial document for which it is difficult the full version of which is difficult to find.",
        "3.2 Extralinguistic Criteria Two tweets are more likely to be a part of a larger document consisting of a series of tweets if Reply-relation one of them is a reply to the other, Temporal proximity they are published immediately one after the other, or Continuation markers they share such markers as numbers, arrows>> and continuation marker ?",

        "3.3 Linguistic Clues Semantic similarity to the query In order to determine the relatedness of two documents, the similarity between their term distributions is mainly considered.",
        "Based on this idea, one of our baseline methods will represent each tweet as a bag-of-words vector and retrieve a tweet containing no query term if its tf-idf weighted vector has a high cosine similarity with at least one vector from a tweet containing a query term.",
        "Discourse markers Users may add a discourse marker when writing a new sentence in a new tweet.",
        "If a tweet begins with a marker that indicates continuation of a discourse, it is likely to be a part of a larger document.",
        "A sentiment analysis in Twitter by Mukherjee and Bhattacharyya (2012) adopted discourse relations from Wolf et al. (2004).",
        "In this paper, we use linguistic characteristics described by Kang (1999) in order to classify Korean texts, listing their English translations in Table 1.",
        "The discourse marker feature refers to whether or not any marker on the list occurs in the first N words (set N = 5) of the tweet.",
        "4 Experiments 4.1 Data We collected 173,271 tweets posted or retweeted by 105 Korean users, including film critics, film stu-dents, and amateur cinephiles from 27 July to 26 September 2013.",
        "Out of the 105 users, 17 users who had mentioned the film Snowpiercer 5 most often were singled out.",
        "In addition, the highest overall occurrence of the keyword was found to be between 1 to 15 August, probably due the film's release on 31 5 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1706620/ 61 Demonstratives this, that, it, here, there Proverbs be so, do so Discourse well, now Conj-Reasoning because, so, therfore, thus, hence Conj-Conditional then, as long as, in the case, under Conj-Coordinate and, nor Conj-Adversative but, yet, however, still, by contrast Conj-Discourse meanwhile, anyway, by the way Table 1: List of selected Korean discourse markers used for classifying text types in Kang (1999), translated into English July in South Korea.",

        "Each tweet in the filtered set was labeled as related or not related to the movie by three annotators who were Twitter users already following most of the above 17 users and thus aware of the context of most tweets, and a tweet was considered relevant if two or more of the annotators agreed.",

        "Among the seed words above, only Snowpiercer was ever used as a hashtag, and happened only three times (twice in English and once in Korean).",
        "Only nine types of hashtags occurred more than twice in the full dataset (they are presented in Table 4 with their respective frequencies).",
