        "Web search results clustering (SRC), also known as post-retrieval clustering or ephemeral clustering has received much attention for the past twenty years for easing up user's effort in web browsing.",
        "The key idea behind SRC systems is to return some meaningful labeled clusters from a set of web documents (or web snippets) retrieved from a search engine for a given query.",
        "Recently, SRC strategies have been focusing on the introduction of external (exogenous) knowledge to better capture semantics between documents (Scaiella et al., 2012; Marco and Navigli, 2013).",
        "Although this research direction has evidenced competitive results, the proposed clustering techniques are based on a single cluster quality measure, which must reflect alone the goodness of a given partitioning.",
        "These techniques are usually referred to as single objective optimizations (SOO).",
        "In this paper, we hypothesize that improved clustering can be achieved by defining different objective functions over well-known data representations.",
        "As such, our study aims to focus on new clustering issues for SRC instead of defining new representation spaces.",
        "Recent studies (Maulik et al., 2011) have shown that clustering can be defined as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem.",
        "Within the context of SRC, we propose to define two objective functions (compactness and separability), which are simultaneously optimized using a MOO-based simulated annealing technique called AMOSA (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2008).",
        "In order to draw conclusive remarks, we present an exhaustive evaluation where our MOO algorithm (MOO-clus) is compared to the most competitive text-based (endogenous) SRC algorithms: STC (Zamir and Etzioni, 1998), LINGO (Osinski and Weiss, 2005), OPTIMSRC (Carpineto and Romano, 2010) and GK-means (Moreno et al., 2013).",

        "2 Related Work 2.1 SRC Algorithms One of the most cited SRC solutions is the Suffix Tree Clustering (STC) algorithm proposed by (Zamir and Etzioni, 1998).",
        "They propose a monothetic clustering technique, which merges base clusters with high string overlap based on web snippets represented as compact tries.",
        "Their evaluation shows improvements over agglomerative hierarchical clustering, K-Means, Buckshot, Fractionation and Single-Pass algorithms, and is still a hard baseline to beat (Moreno and Dias, 2014).",
        "Later, (Osinski and Weiss, 2005) proposed a polythetic solution called LINGO based on the same string representation as of (Zamir and Etzioni, 1998).",
        "They first extract frequent phrases based on suffix-arrays and match group descriptions with topics obtained with latent semantic analysis.",
        "Documents are then assigned straightforwardly to their corresponding groups.",
        "Their evaluation does not allow conclusive remarks but they propose an open source implementation, which is an important contribution.",
        "More recently, (Carpineto and Romano, 2010) showed that the characteristics of the outputs returned by SRC algorithms suggest the adoption of a meta clustering approach.",
        "The underlying idea is that different SOO solutions lead to complementary results that must be combined.",
        "So, they introduce a novel criterion to measure the concordance of two partitions of objects into different clusters based on the information content associated to the series of decisions made by the partitions on single pairs of objects.",
        "The results of OPTIMSRC demonstrate that meta clustering is superior over individual clustering techniques.",
        "The latest work, exclusively based on endogenous information (i.e. web snippets returned by the search engine), is proposed by (Moreno et al., 2013).",
        "They adapt the K-means algorithm to a third-order similarity measure and propose a stopping criterion to automatically determine the ?optimal?",
        "number of clusters.",
        "Experiments are run over two gold standard data sets, ODP-239 (Carpineto and Romano, 2010) and MORESQUE (Navigli and Crisafulli, 2010), and show improved results over all state-of-the-art text-based SRC techniques so far.",
        "A great deal of works have also proposed to include exogenous information to solve the SRC problem.",
        "One important work is proposed by (Scaiella et al., 2012) who use Wikipedia articles to build a bipartite graph and apply spectral clustering over it to discover relevant clusters.",
        "More recently, (Marco and Navigli, 2013) proposed to include word sense induction based on the Web1T corpus (Brants and Franz, 2006) to improve SRC.",
        "In this paper, we exclusively focus on endogenous solutions.",
        "2.2 MOO-based Clustering Many works have been proposed where the problem of clustering is posed as one of multi-objective optimization (Deb, 2009; Maulik et al., 2011).",
        "One important work is proposed by (Handl and Knowles, 2007) who define a multi-objective clustering technique with automatic K-determination called MOCK.",
        "Their algorithm outperforms several standard single-objective clustering algorithms (K-means, agglomerative hierarchical clustering and ensemble clustering) on artificial data sets.",
        "In parallel, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for fuzzy clustering is proposed by (Bandyopad- hyay et al., 2007) for clustering gene expressions.",
        "Here, two objectives are simultaneously optimized.",
        "The first one is the objective function optimized in the fuzzy C-means algorithm (Bezdek, 1981) and the other one is the Xie-Beni index (Xie and Beni, 1991).",
        "Later, (Mukhopadhyay and Maulik, 2009) proposed a novel approach that combines the multi-objective fuzzy clustering method of (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2007) with a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier.",
        "Performance results are provided for remote sensing data.",
        "As far as we know, within text applications, (Morik et al., 2012) is the first work, which formulates text clustering a multi-objective optimization problem.",
        "In particular, they express desired properties of frequent termset clustering in terms of multiple conflicting objective functions.",
        "The optimization is solved by a genetic algorithm and the result is a set of Pareto-optimal solutions.",
        "Note that this effort is 100 defined for large text colllections with high dimensional data, which is contradictory to the specific task of SRC (Carpineto et al., 2009) 2 .",
        "2.3 Our Motivation Recent works have focused on the introduction of external (exogenous) knowledge to solve the SRC task.",
        "However, this research direction higly depends on existing resources, which are not available for a great deal of languages.",
        "Moreover, (Carpineto and Romano, 2010) has suggested an interesting research direction, which has still remained unexplored.",
        "Indeed, (Carpineto and Romano, 2010) showed that meta clustering leads to improved results in the context of text-based (endogenous) SRC.",
        "This suggests that better clustering can be obtained by combining different SOO solutions.",
        "However, their algorithm is casted to a SOO problem of the concordance between the clustering combination and a meta partition.",
        "As a consequence, we hypothesize that improved performances can be obtained by defining the SRC task as a MOO clustering problem.",
        "For that purpose, we (1) take advantage of the recent advances in the field of multi-objective clustering (Saha and Bandyopadhyay, 2010), (2) define new objective functions in a non euclidean space and (3) adapt a MOO-based simulated annealing technique called AMOSA (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2008) to take into account third-order similarity metrics (Moreno et al., 2013).",

        "In general, a MOO algorithm outputs a set of solutions not dominated by any solution encountered by it.",
        "These notions can be illustrated by considering an optimization problem with two objective functions (f 1 and f 2 ) with six different solutions, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "Here target is to maximize both objective functions f 1 and f 2 .",

        "Based on domination status, different cases may arise: (i) accept the new-pt, (ii) accept the current-pt or (iii) accept a solution from the archive.",

        "The process is repeated iter times for each temperature that is annealed with a cooling rate of ?",
        "(<1) till the minimum temperature T min is attained.",
        "The process thereafter stops and the archive contains the final non-dominated solutions i.e. the Pareto front.",
        "4 SRC as MOO Problem: MOO-clus 4.1 Archive Initialization As we follow an endogenous approach, only the information returned by a search engine is used.",
        "In particular, we only deal with web snippets and each one is represented as a word feature vector.",
        "So, our solution called MOO-clus starts its execution after initializing the archive with some random solutions as archive members.",
        "Here, a particular solution refers to a complete assignment of web snippets (or data points) in several clusters.",
        "So, the first step is to represent a solution compatible with AMOSA, which represents each individual solution as a string.",
        "In order to encode the clustering problem in the form of a string, a center-based representation is used.",
        "Note that the use of a string representation facilitates the definition of individuals and mutation functions (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2008).",
        "Let us assume that the archive member i represents the centroids of K i clusters and the number of tokens in a centroid is p 3 , then the archive member (or string) has length l i where l i = p?K i .",
        "To initialize the number of centroids K i encoded in the string i, a random value between 2 and K max is chosen and each K i cluster centroid is initialized by randomly generated tokens from the global vocabulary.",
        "4.2 Assignment of Web Snippets As for any classical clustering algorithms, web snippets (or data points) must be assigned to their respective clusters.",
        "In MOO-clus, this assignment is computed as in (Moreno et al., 2013), to take advantage of recent advances in similarity measures.",

        "4.3 Definition of Objective Functions A string i represents a set of centroids to which web snippets can be assigned as seen in Section 4.2.",
        "As a consequence, each string i corresponds to a candidate partition of the data space.",

        "Here our target is to form good clusters whose compactness in terms of similarity should be maximum.",
        "The second objective function is cluster separability, which measures the dissimilarity between two cluster centroids.",
        "Indeed, the purpose of any clustering algorithm is to obtain compact similar typed clusters, which are dissimilar to each other.",
        "Here, we define separability as the minimization of the summation of similarities between each pair of cluster centroids.",
        "This is defined in Equation 4, where m pi k and m pi o are the centroids of clusters pi k and pi o , respectively.",
        "Separability = K ?",

        "o=k+1 S(m pi k ,m pi o ) (4) Finally, for a particular string, the following objectives {Compactness, 1 Separability } are maximized using the search capability of AMOSA.",
        "4.4 Search Operators In MOO-clus, AMOSA is used as the optimization strategy.",
        "For that purpose, three different types of mutation operations have been defined to suit the framework.",
        "Mutation 1: This mutation operation is used to update the cluster center representation.",
        "Each token of cluster centroid is replaced by one token from the global vocabulary according to highest SCP similarity.",
        "This is applied individually to all tokens of a particular centroid if it is selected for mutation.",
        "Mutation 2: This mutation operation is used to reduce the size of the string by 1.",
        "We randomly select a cluster centroid and thereafter all the tokens of this centroid are deleted from the string.",
        "Mutation 3: This mutation is for increasing the size of string by 1 i.e. one new centroid is inserted in the string.",
        "For that purpose, we randomly choose p number of tokens from the global vocabulary and add it to the string.",

        "Each token of the word vector (w 3 , w 4 ) will be changed by some token from the global vocabulary using SCP.",
        "Then, after change, the string will look like < w 1 w 2 w new 3 w new 4 w 5 w 6 >.",
        "If mutation 2 is selected, a centroid will be removed from the string.",
        "Let centroid 3 be selected for deletion.",
        "The new string will look like < w 1 w 2 w 3 w 4 >.",

        "After inclusion of this centroid, the string will be < w 1 w 2 w 3 w 4 w 5 w 6 w 7 w 8 >.",
        "In our experiments, we have associated equal probability to each of these mutation operations.",
        "Thus, each mutation is applied in 33% cases of the cases.",
