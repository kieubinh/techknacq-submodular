        "Sentiment analysis on social media has been one of the most targeted research topics in NLP in the past decade, as shown in several recent surveys (Liu and Zhang, 2012; Tsytsarau and Palpanas, 2012).",
        "Since the goal of sentiment analysis is to automatically detect the polarity of a document, misinterpreting irony and sarcasm represents a big challenge (Davidov et al., 2010).",
        "As there is only a weak boundary in meaning between irony, sarcasm and satire (Reyes et al., 2012), we will use only the term sarcasm in this paper.",
        "Bosco et al. (2013) claim that ?even if there is no agreement on a formal definition of irony, psychological experiments have delivered evidence that humans can reliably identify ironic text utterances from an early age in life.?",
        "We have thus decided to rely on the ability of our human annotators to manually label sarcastic tweets to train our classifiers.",
        "Sarcasm generally reverses the polarity of an utterance from positive or negative into its opposite, which deteriorates the results of a given NLP task.",
        "Therefore, correct identification of sarcasm can improve the performance.",
        "The issue of automatic sarcasm detection has been addressed mostly in English, although there has been some research in other languages, such as Dutch (Liebrecht et al., 2013), Italian (Bosco et al., 2013), or Brazilian Portuguese (Vanin et al., 2013).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, no research has been conducted in Czech or other Slavic languages.",
        "These languages are challenging for many NLP tasks because of their rich morphology and syntax.",
        "This has motivated us to focus our current research on both English and Czech.",
        "Majority of the existing state-of-the-art techniques are language dependent, which rely on language-specific lexical resources.",
        "Since no such resources are available for Czech, we adapt some language-independent methods and also apply various preprocessing steps for sentiment analysis proposed by Habernal et al. (2013).",
        "This paper focuses on document-level sarcasm detection on Czech and English Twitter datasets using supervised machine learning methods.",
        "The Czech dataset consists of 7,000 manually labeled tweets, ",
        "213 the English dataset consists of a balanced distribution and an imbalanced distribution, each containing 100,000 tweets, where hashtag #sarcasm was used as an indicator of sarcastic tweets.",
        "We provide both datasets under Creative Commons BY-NC-SA licence 1 at http://liks.fav.zcu.cz/ sarcasm/.",
        "Our research questions were the following: (1) To what extent can the language-independent approach compete with methods based on lexical language-dependent resources?",
        "(2) Is it possible to reach good agreement on annotating sarcasm and what typical text properties on Twitter are important for sarcasm detection?",
        "(3) What is the best preprocessing pipeline that can boost performance on highly-flective Czech language and what types of features and classifiers yield the best results?",
        "The rest of this article is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the related work.",
        "In section 3, we outline our approach to sarcasm detection and describe the selection of features in our approach.",
        "Section 4 thoroughly describes the datasets and the annotation process.",
        "Section 5 describes and discusses the experimental results.",
        "Finally we conclude in Section 6.",
        "2 Related Work Experiments with semi-supervised sarcasm identification on a Twitter dataset (5.9 million tweets) and on 66,000 product reviews from Amazon were conducted in (Davidov et al., 2010) and (Tsur et al., 2010).",
        "They used 5-fold cross validation on their kNN-like classifier and obtained an F-measure of 0.83 on the product reviews dataset and 0.55 on the Twitter dataset.",
        "For acquiring the Twitter dataset they used hashtag #sarcasm as an indicator of sarcastic tweets.",
        "They further created a balanced evaluation set of 180 tweets using 15 human annotators via Amazon Mechanical Turk 2 and achieved an inter-annotator agreement 0.41 (Fleiss?",
        "?).",
        "Gonz?alez-Ib?a?nez et al. (2011) experimented with Twitter data divided into three categories (sarcas- tic, positive sentiment and negative sentiment), each containing 900 tweets.",
        "They used the #sarcasm and #sarcastic hashtags to identify sarcastic tweets.",
        "They used two classifiers ?",
        "support vector machine (SVM) with sequential minimal optimization (SMO) and logistic regression.",
        "They tried various combinations of unigrams, dictionary-based features and pragmatic factors (positive and negative emoticons and user references), achieving the best result (accuracy 0.65) for sarcastic and non-sarcastic classification with the combination of SVM with SMO and unigrams.",
        "They employed 3 human judges to annotate 180 tweets (90 sarcastic and 90 non-sarcastic).",
        "The human judges achieved Fleiss?",
        "?",
        "= 0.586, demonstrating the difficulty of sarcasm classification.",
        "Another experiment included 50 sarcastic and 50 non-sarcastic (25 positive, 25 negative) tweets with emoticons annotated by two judges.",
        "The automatic classification and human judges achieved the accuracy of 0.71 and 0.89 respectively.",
        "The inter-annotator agreement (Cohen's ?)",
        "was 0.74.",
        "Reyes et al. (2012) proposed features to capture properties of a figurative language such as ambiguity, polarity, unexpectedness and emotional scenarios.",
        "Their corpus consists of five categories (humor, irony, politics, technology and general), each containing 10,000 tweets.",
        "The best result in the classification of irony and general tweets was F-measure 0.65.",
        "In (Reyes et al., 2013) they explored the representativeness and relevance of conceptual features (sig- natures, unexpectedness, style and emotional scenarios).",
        "These features include punctuation marks, emoticons, quotes, capitalized words, lexicon-based features, character n-grams, skip-grams, (Guthrie et al., 2006), and polarity skip-grams.",
        "Their corpus consists of four categories (irony, humor, education and politics), each containing 10,000 tweets.",
        "Their evaluation was performed on two distributional sce-narios, balanced distribution and imbalanced distribution (25% ironic tweets and 75% tweets from all three non-ironic categories) using the Naive Bayes and decision trees algorithms from the Weka toolkit (Witten and Frank, 2005).",
        "The classification by the decision trees achieved an F-measure of 0.72 on the balanced distribution and an F-measure of 0.53 on the imbalanced distribution.",
        "The work of Riloff et al. (2013) identifies one type of sarcasm: contrast between a positive sentiment and negative situation.",
        "They used a bootstrapping algorithm to acquire lists of positive sentiment phrases 1 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/ 2 http://www.mturk.com 214 and negative situation phrases from sarcastic tweets.",
        "They proposed a method which classifies tweets as sarcastic if it contains a positive predicative that precedes a negative situation phrase in close proximity.",
        "Their evaluation on a human-annotated dataset 3 of 3000 tweets (23% sarcastic) was done using the SVM classifier with unigrams and bigrams as features, achieving an F-measure of 0.48.",
        "The hybrid approach that combines the results of the SVM classifier and their contrast method achieved an F-measure of 0.51.",
        "Sarcasm and nastiness classification in online dialogues was also explored in (Lukin and Walker, 2013) using bootstrapping, syntactic patterns and a high precision classifier.",
        "They achieved an F-measure of 0.57 on their sarcasm dataset.",
        "3 Our Approach This paper presents the first attempt at sarcasm detection in the Czech language, in which we focus on supervised machine learning approaches and evaluate their performance.",
        "We selected various n-grams, including unigrams, bigrams, trigrams with frequency greater than three (Liebrecht et al., 2013), and a set of language-independent features, including punctuation marks, emoticons, quotes, capitalized words, character n-grams and skip-grams (Reyes et al., 2013) as our baselines.",
        "3.1 Classification Our evaluation was performed using the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers.",
        "We used Brainy ?",
        "a Java framework for machine learning (Konkol, 2014) ?",
        "with default settings (the linear kernel for SVM).",
        "All experiments were conducted in the 5-fold cross validation manner similar to (Davidov et al., 2010; Gonz?alez-Ib?a?nez et al., 2011).",
        "Our motivation to test multiple classifiers stemmed also from related works which mostly test more than one classifier.",
        "On the other hand, the choice between state-of-the-art linear classifiers might not be much of importance, as the most important is the feature engineering.",
        "3.2 Features For our evaluation we used the most promising language-independent features from the related work and POS related features.",
        "Feature sets used in our evaluation are described in Table 1.",
        "Group Features Description N-gram Character n-gram We used character n-gram features (Blamey et al., 2012).",
        "We set the minimum occurrence of a particular character n-gram to either 5 or 50, in order to prune the feature space.",
        "Our character feature set contains 3-grams to 6-grams.",
        "N-gram We used word unigrams, bigrams and trigrams as binary features.",
        "The feature space is pruned by the minimum n-gram occurrence set to 3 (Liebrecht et al., 2013).",
        "Skip-bigram Instead of using sequences of adjacent words (n-grams) we used skip-grams (Guthrie et al., 2006), which skip over arbitrary gaps.",
        "Reyes et al. (2013) consider skip-bigrams with 2 or 3 word skips and remove skip-grams with a frequency?",
        "20.",
        "Pattern Pattern Patterns composed of high frequency words (HFWs) 4 and content words (CWs) 5 used by (Davidov et al., 2010).",
        "Pattern must contain at least one high frequency word.",
        "The patterns contain 2-6 HFWs and 1-6 CWs.",
        "We set the minimum occurrence of a particular pattern to 5.",
        "Word-shape pattern We tried to improve pattern features by using word-shape classes for content words.",
        "We assign words into one of 24 classes 6 similar to the function specified in (Bikel et al., 1997).",
        "POS POS characteristics We implemented various POS features, e.g., the number of nouns, verbs, and adjectives (Ahkter and Soria, 2010), the ratio of nouns to adjectives and verbs to adverbs (Kouloumpis et al., 2011), and number of negative verbs obtained from POS tags.",
        "3 They used three annotators.",
        "Each annotator was given the same 100 tweets with the sarcasm hashtag and 100 tweets without the sarcasm hashtag (the hashtags were removed).",
        "On these tweets the pairwise inter-annotator scores were computed (Cohen's Kappa ?",
        "1 = 0.80, ?",
        "2 = 0.81 and ?",
        "3 = 0.82).",
        "Then each annotator labeled additional 1000 tweets.",
        "4 A word whose corpus frequency is more than 1000 words per million plus all punctuation characters.",
        "5 A word whose corpus frequency is less than 1000 words per million.",
        "6 We use edu.stanford.nlp.process.WordShapeClassifier with the WORDSHAPECHRIS1 setting.",
        "215 POS word-shape Unigram feature consisting of POS and word-shape (see Word-shape pattern).",
        "The feature space is pruned by the minimum occurrence set to 5.",
        "POS n-gram Direct use of POS n-grams has not shown any significant improvement in sentiment analysis but it may improve the results of sarcasm detection.",
        "We experimented with 3-grams to 6-grams with the minimum n-gram occurrence set to 5.",
        "Others Emoticons We used two lists of positive and negative emoticons (Montejo-R?aez et al., 2012).",
        "The feature captures the number of occurrences of each class of emoticons within the text.",
        "Punctuation-based We adapted punctuation-based features proposed by (Davidov et al., 2010).",
        "This feature set consists of number of words, exclamation marks, question marks, quotation marks and capitalized words normalized by dividing them by the maximal observed value multiplied by the averaged maximal value of the other feature groups.",
        "Pointedness Pointedness was used by (Reyes et al., 2013) to distinguish irony.",
        "It focuses on explicit marks which should reflect a sharp distinction in the information that is transmitted.",
        "The presence of punctuation marks, emoticons, quotes and capitalized words has been considered.",
        "Extended Pointedness This feature captures the number of occurrences of punctuation marks and emoticons as well as the number of words, exclamation marks, question marks, quotation marks and capitalized words normalized by maximal observed value.",
        "Word-case We implemented various word-case features that include, e.g., the number of upper cased words, number of words with first letter capital normalized by number of words and number of upper cased characters normalized by number of words.",
        "Table 1: Descriptions of used feature sets.",
        "4 Evaluation Datasets We collected datasets using Twitter Search API and Java Language Detector 7 .",
        "We collected 140,000 Czech and 780,000 English tweets, respectively.",
        "Due to lack of support for the Czech language on Twitter, we used the Twitter Search API parameter geocode to acquire tweets posted near Prague.",
        "For the English dataset we also collected tweets with the #sarcasm hashtag.",
        "Czech users generally don't use the sarcasm (?#sarkasmus?)",
        "or irony (?#ironie?)",
        "hashtag variants 8 thus we had to annotate the Czech dataset manually.",
        "The final label distribution in datasets is shown in Table 4.",
        "4.1 Filtering and Normalization All user, URL and hashtag references in tweets have been replaced by ?user?, ?link?",
        "and ?hashtag?",
        "respectively.",
        "We also removed all tweets starting with ?RT?",
        "because they refer to previous tweets and tweets containing just combinations of user, link, ?RT?",
        "and hashtags without any additional words.",
        "Tokenization of tweets requires proper handling of emoticons and other special character sequences typical on Twitter.",
        "The Ark-tweet-nlp tool (Gimpel et al., 2011) offers precisely that and although it was developed and tested in English, it yields satisfactory results in Czech as well.",
        "Czech is a highly flective language and uses a lot of diacritics.",
        "However some Czech users type only the unaccented characters.",
        "9 Preliminary experiments showed that removing diacritics yields better results, thus we removed diacritics from all tweets.",
        "4.2 Czech Dataset Annotation Firstly we conducted an experiment to determine whether to annotate the original data or the normalized data.",
        "We selected two sample sets of 50 tweets containing Czech sarcasm (#sarkasmus) and irony (#ironie) hashtags and other tweets.",
        "One annotator obtained the original data while the other got the normalized data from the first sample set.",
        "We then tried to give both annotators the original data from the first sample set and finally we gave them both the normalized data from the second sample set.",
        "Table 2 shows the difficulty of sarcasm identification without the knowledge hidden in hashtags, user and links.",
        "7 http://code.google.com/p/jlangdetect/ 8 We found only 10 tweets with sarcasm hashtag (?#sarkasmus?)",
        "and 100 tweets with irony hashtag (?#ironie?)",
