        "In fact, our experiment to create a corpus comprising 30,000 Japanese sentences took less than eight hours to run.",
        "Based on this corpus, we also develop a supervised discourse parser and evaluate its performance to verify the usefulness of the acquired corpus."

        "Humans understand text not by individually interpreting clauses or sentences, but by linking such a text fragment with another in a particular context.",
        "To allow computers to understand text, it is essential to capture the precise relations between these text fragments.",
        "This kind of analysis is called discourse parsing or discourse structure analysis, and is an important and fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP).",
        "Systems for discourse parsing are, however, available only for major languages, such as English, owing to the lack of corpora with discourse annotations.",
        "For English, several corpora with discourse annotations have been developed manually, consuming a great deal of time and cost in the process.",
        "These include the Penn Discourse Treebank (Prasad et al., 2008), RST Discourse Treebank (Carlson et al., 2001), and Discourse Graphbank (Wolf and Gibson, 2005).",
        "Discourse parsers trained on these corpora have also been developed and practically used.",
        "To create the same resource-rich environment for another language, a quicker method than the conventional time-consuming framework should be sought.",
        "One possible approach is to use crowdsourcing, which has actively been used to produce various language resources in recent years (e.g., (Snow et al., 2008; Negri et al., 2011; Hong and Baker, 2011; Fossati et al., 2013)).",
        "It is, however, difficult to crowdsource the difficult judgments for discourse annotations, which typically consists of two steps: finding a pair of spans with a certain relation and identifying the relation between the pair.",
        "In this paper, we propose a method for crowdsourcing discourse annotations that simplifies the procedure by dividing it into two steps.",
        "The point is that by simplifying the annotation task it is suitable for crowdsourcing, but does not skew the annotations for use in practical discourse parsing.",
        "First, finding a discourse unit for the span is a costly process, and thus we adopt a clause as the discourse unit, since this is reliable enough to be automatically detected.",
        "We also limit the length of each target document to three sentences and at most five clauses to facilitate the annotation task.",
        "Secondly, we detect and annotate clause pairs in a document that hold logical discourse relations.",
        "However, since this is too complicated to assign as one task using crowdsourcing, we divide the task into two steps: determining the existence of logical discourse relations and annotating the type of relation.",
        "Our two-stage approach is a robust method in that it confirms the existence of the discourse relations twice.",
        "We also designed the tagset of discourse relations for crowdsourcing, which consists of two layers, where the upper layer contains the following three classes: ?CONTINGENCY,?",
        "?COMPARISON?",
        "and ?OTHER.?",
        "Although the task This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "269 settings are simplified for crowdsourcing, the obtained corpus and knowledge of discourse parsing could be still useful in general discourse parsing.",
        "In our experiments, we crowdsourced discourse annotations for Japanese, for which there are no publicly available corpora with discourse annotations.",
        "The resulting corpus consists of 10,000 documents, each of which comprises three sentences extracted from the web.",
        "Carrying out this two-stage crowdsourcing task took less than eight hours.",
        "The time elapsed was significantly shorter than the conventional corpus building method.",
        "We also developed a discourse parser by exploiting the acquired corpus with discourse annotations.",
        "We learned a machine learning-based model for discourse parsing based on this corpus and evaluated its performance.",
        "An F1 value of 37.9% was achieved for contingency relations, which would be roughly comparable with state-of-the-art discourse parsers on English.",
        "This result indicates the usefulness of the acquired corpus.",
        "The resulting discourse parser would be effectively exploited in NLP applications, such as sentiment analysis (Zirn et al., 2011) and contradiction detection (Murakami et al., 2009; Ennals et al., 2010).",
        "The novel contributions of this study are summarized below: ?",
        "We propose a framework for developing a corpus with discourse annotations using two-stage crowd-sourcing, which is both cheap and quick to execute, but still retains good quality of the annotations.",
        "?",
        "We construct a Japanese discourse corpus in an extremely short time.",
        "?",
        "We develop a discourse parser based on the acquired corpus.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 introduces related work, while Section 3 describes our proposed framework and reports the experimental results for the creation of a corpus with discourse annotations.",
        "Section 4 presents a method for discourse parsing based on the corpus as well as some experimental results.",
        "Section 5 concludes the paper.",
        "2 Related Work Snow et al. (2008) applied crowdsourcing to five NLP annotation tasks, but the settings of these tasks are very simple.",
        "There have also been several attempts to construct language resources with complex annotations using crowdsourcing.",
        "Negri et al. (2011) proposed a method for developing a cross-lingual textual entailment (CLTE) corpus using crowdsourcing.",
        "They tackled this complex data creation task by dividing it into several simple subtasks: sentence modification, type annotation and sentence translation.",
        "The creative CLTE task and subtasks are quite different from our non-creative task and subtasks of discourse annotations.",
        "Fossati et al. (2013) proposed FrameNet annotations using crowdsourcing.",
        "Their method is a single-step approach to only detect frame elements.",
        "They verified the usefulness of their approach through an experiment on a small set of verbs with only two frame ambiguities per verb.",
        "Although they seem to be running a larger-scale experiment, its result has not been revealed yet.",
        "Hong and Baker (2011) presented a crowdsourcing method for selecting FrameNet frames, which is a part of the FrameNet annotation process.",
        "Since their task is equivalent to word sense disambiguation, it is not very complex compared to the whole FrameNet annotation process.",
        "These FrameNet annotations are still different from discourse annotations, which are our target.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, there have been no attempts to crowdsource discourse annotations.",
        "There are several manually-crafted corpora with discourse annotation for English, such as the Penn Discourse Treebank (Prasad et al., 2008), RST Discourse Treebank (Carlson et al., 2001), and Discourse Graphbank (Wolf and Gibson, 2005).",
        "These corpora were developed from English newspaper articles.",
        "Several attempts have been made to manually create corpora with discourse annotations for languages other than English.",
        "These include the Potsdam Commentary Corpus (Stede, 2004) for German (news- paper; 2,900 sentences), Rhetalho (Pardo et al., 2004) for Portuguese (scientific papers; 100 documents; 1,350 sentences), and the RST Spanish Treebank for Spanish (da Cunha et al., 2011) (several genres; 267 documents; 2,256 sentences).",
        "All of these consist of relatively small numbers of sentences compared with the English corpora containing several tens of thousands sentences.",
        "270 In recent years, there have been many studies on discourse parsing on the basis of the above hand-annotated corpora (e.g., (Pitler et al., 2009; Pitler and Nenkova, 2009; Subba and Di Eugenio, 2009; Hernault et al., 2010; Ghosh et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2012; Feng and Hirst, 2012; Joty et al., 2012; Joty et al., 2013; Biran and McKeown, 2013; Lan et al., 2013)).",
        "This surge of research on discourse parsing can be attributed to the existence of corpora with discourse annotations.",
        "However, the target language is mostly English since English is the only language that has large-scale discourse corpora.",
        "To develop and improve discourse parsers for languages other than English, it is necessary to build large-scale annotated corpora, especially in a short period if possible.",
        "3 Development of Corpus with Discourse Annotations using Crowdsourcing 3.1 Corpus Specifications We develop a tagged corpus in which pairs of discourse units are annotated with discourse relations.",
        "To achieve this, it is necessary to determine target documents, discourse units, and a discourse relation tagset.",
        "The following subsections explain the details of these three aspects.",
        "3.1.1 Target Text and Discourse Unit In previous studies on constructing discourse corpora, the target documents were mainly newspaper texts, such as the Wall Street Journal for English.",
        "However, discourse parsers trained on such newspaper corpora usually have a problem of domain adaptation.",
        "That is to say, while discourse parsers trained on newspaper corpora are good at analyzing newspaper texts, they generally cannot perform well on texts of other domains.",
        "To address this problem, we set out to create an annotated corpus covering a variety of domains.",
        "Since the web contains many documents across a variety of domains, we use the Diverse Document Leads Corpus (Hangyo et al., 2012), which was extracted from the web.",
        "Each document in this corpus consists of the first three sentences of a Japanese web page, making these short documents suitable for our discourse annotation method based on crowdsourcing.",
        "We adopt the clause as a discourse unit, since spans are too fine-grained to annotate using crowdsourcing and sentences are too coarse-grained to capture discourse relations.",
        "Clauses, which are automatically identified, do not need to be manually modified since they are thought to be reliable enough.",
        "Clause identification is performed using the rules of Shibata and Kurohashi (2005).",
        "For example, the following rules are used to identify clauses as our discourse units: ?",
        "clauses that function as a relatively strong boundary in a sentence are adopted, ?",
        "relative clauses are excluded.",
        "Since workers involved in our crowdsourcing task need to judge whether clause pairs have discourse relations, the load of these workers increases combinatorially as the number of clauses in a sentence increases.",
        "To alleviate this problem, we limit the number of clauses in a document to five.",
        "This limitation excludes only about 5% of the documents in the original corpus.",
        "Our corpus consists of 10,000 documents corresponding to 30,000 sentences.",
        "The total number of clauses in this corpus is 39,032, and thus the average number of clauses in a document is 3.9.",
        "The total number of clause pairs is 59,426.",
        "3.1.2 Discourse Relation Tagset One of our supposed applications of discourse parsing is to automatically generate a bird's eye view of a controversial topic as in Statement Map (Murakami et al., 2009) and Dispute Finder (Ennals et al., 2010), which identify various relations between statements, including contradictory relations.",
        "We assume that expansion relations, such as elaboration and restatement, and temporal relations are not important for this purpose.",
        "This setting is similar to the work of Bethard et al. (2008), which annotated temporal relations independently of causal relations.",
        "We also suppose that temporal relations can be annotated separately for NLP applications that require temporal information.",
        "We determined the tagset of discourse relations 271 Upper type Lower type Example CONTINGENCY Cause/Reason ???????????????????",
        "[since (I) pushed the button] [hot water was turned on] Purpose ?????????????????????",

        "[that restaurant is surely good] [the price is high] OTHER (Other) ???????????????????",
        "[After being back home] [it began to rain] Table 1: Discourse relation tagset with examples.",
        "by referring to the Penn Discourse Treebank.",
        "This tagset consists of two layers, where the upper layer contains three classes and the lower layer seven classes as follows: ?",
        "CONTINGENCY ?",
        "Cause/Reason (causal relations and not conditional relations) ?",
        "Purpose (purpose-action relations where the purpose is not necessarily accomplished) ?",
        "Condition (conditional relations) ?",
        "Ground (other contingency relations including pragmatic cause/condition) ?",
        "COMPARISON (same as the Penn Discourse Treebank) ?",
        "Contrast ?",
        "Concession ?",
        "OTHER (other weak relation or no relation) Note that we do not consider the direction of relations to simplify the annotation task for crowdsourcing.",
        "Table 1 shows examples of our tagset.",
        "Therefore, our task is to annotate clause pairs in a document with one of the discourse relations given above.",
        "Sample annotations of a document are shown below.",
        "Here, clause boundaries are shown by ?::?",
        "and clause pairs that are not explicitly marked are allocated the ?OTHER?",

        "3.2 Two-stage Crowdsourcing for Discourse Annotations We create a corpus with discourse annotations using two-stage crowdsourcing.",
        "We divide the annotation task into the following two subtasks: determining whether a clause pair has a discourse relation excluding ?OTHER,?",
        "and then, ascertaining the type of discourse relation for a clause pair that passes the first stage.",

        "3.2.1 Stage 1: Judgment of Discourse Relation Existence This subtask determines whether each clause pair in a document has one of the following discourse relations: Cause/Reason, Purpose, Condition, Ground, Contrast, and Concession (that is, all the relations except ?OTHER?).",
        "Workers are shown examples of these relations and asked to determine only the existence thereof.",
        "In this subtask, an item presented to a worker at a particular time consists of all the judgments of clause pairs in a document.",
        "By adopting this approach, each worker considers the entire document when making his/her judgments.",
        "3.2.2 Stage 2: Judgment of Discourse Relation Type This subtask involves ascertaining the discourse relation type for a clause pair that passes the first stage.",
        "The result of this subtask is one of the seven lower types in our discourse relation tagset.",
        "Workers are shown examples of these types and then asked to select one of the relations.",
        "If a worker chooses ?OTHER,?",
        "this corresponds to canceling the positive determination of the existence of the discourse relation in stage one.",
        "In this subtask, an item is the judgment of a clause pair.",
        "That is, if a document contains more than one clause pair that must be judged, the judgments for this document are divided into multiple items, although this is rare.",
        "3.3 Experiment and Discussion We conducted an experiment of the two-stage crowdsourcing approach using Yahoo!",
        "Crowdsourcing.",
        "1 To increase the reliability of the produced corpus, we set the number of workers for each item for each task to 10.",
        "The reason why we chose this value is as follows.",
        "While Snow et al. (2008) claimed that an average of 4 non-expert labels per item in order to emulate expert-level label quality, the quality of some tasks increased by increasing the number of workers to 10.",
        "We also tested hidden gold-standard items once every 10 items to examine worker's quality.",
        "If a worker failed these items in serial, he/she would have to take a test to continue the task.",
        "We obtained judgments for the 59,426 clause pairs in the 10,000 documents of our corpus in the first stage of crowdsourcing, i.e., the subtask of determining the existence of discourse relations.",
        "We calculated the probability of each label using GLAD 2 (Whitehill et al., 2009), which was proved to be more reliable than the majority voting.",
        "This probability corresponds to the probability of discourse relation existence of each clause pair.",
        "Table 2 lists the results.",
        "We set a probability threshold to select those clause pairs whose types were to be judged in the second stage of crowdsourcing.",
        "With this threshold set to 0.01, 9,068 clause pairs (15.3% of all the clause pairs) were selected.",
        "The threshold was set fairly low to allow low-probability judgments to be re-examined in the second stage.",

        "It would be four times longer than our two-stage approach.",
        "Such single-stage approach is also not robust since it does not have a double check mechanism, with which the two-stage approach is equipped.",
        "We spent 111 thousand yen and 113 thousand yen (approx- imately 1,100 USD, respectively) for these subtasks, which would be extremely less expensive than the projects of conventional discourse annotations.",
        "For the examples in Table 5, we confirmed that the discourse relation types of the top four examples were surely correct.",
        "However, we judged the type (Contrast) of the bottom example as incorrect.",
