        "If the segments containing WOEs are known, 85.8% of correct sentences can be generated by our approach.",
        "Finally, Ranking SVM orders the generated candidates based on POS bigrams and POS trigrams features, and achieves an MRR of 0.270 when all erroneous segments are given and an MRR of 0.208 when both detection and correction modules are considered.",
        "287 Using words as the reordering unit reduces the cost to generate numerous candidates, but 6% of sentences are unable to reorder due to the word segmentation issue.",
        "How to balance the trade-off has to be investigated further.",

        "Since the corpus of WOEs in Chinese is still in a limited size, expanding the related corpus for further research is also indispensable.",
