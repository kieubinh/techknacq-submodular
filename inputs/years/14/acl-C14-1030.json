        "Resolving the ambiguity of person names in web search results is a challenging problem becoming an area of interest for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR) communities.",
        "This task can be defined informally as follows: given a query of a person name in addition to the results of a search engine for that query, the goal is to cluster the resultant web pages according to the different individuals they refer to.",
        "Thus, the challenge of this task is estimating the number of different individuals and grouping the pages of the same individual in the same cluster.",
        "The difficulty of this task resides in the fact that a single person name can be shared by many people: according to the U.S. Census Bureau, 90000 different names are shared by 100 million people (Artiles et al., 2007).",
        "This problem has had an impact in the Internet and that is why several vertical search engines specialized in web people search have appeared in the last years, e.g. spokeo.com or 123people.com.",
        "This task should not be mixed up with entity linking (EL), which goal is to link name mentions of entities in a document collection to entities in a reference knowledge base (typically Wikipedia), or to detect new entities.",
        "The main difficulties of clustering web pages referring to the same individual come from their possible heterogeneous nature.",
        "For example, some pages may be professional sites, while others may be blogs containing personal information.",
        "In addition, the popularity of social networking services makes the search engine usually returns several social profiles belonging to different individuals sharing the same name, as much from the same social networking service as from different services.",
        "These social pages often introduce noisy information and make the state of the art algorithms break down (Berendsen et al., 2012).",
        "Due to these problems, the users have to refine the queries with additional terms.",
        "This task gets harder when the person name is shared by a celebrity or a historical figure, because the results of the search engines are dominated by that individual, making the search of information about other individuals more difficult.",
        "WePS 1 (Web People Search) evaluation campaigns proposed this task in a web searching scenario providing several corpora for evaluating the results of their participants, particularly WePS-1, WePS-2 and WePS-3 campaigns.",
        "This framework allows our approach to be compared with the state of the art This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "1 http://nlp.uned.es/weps/ 301 systems.",
        "We also evaluate our system with ECIR2012 corpus 2 , a data set that includes social networking profiles, providing a more real scenario for this task.",
        "The most successful state of the art systems have addressed this problem with some kind of supervision.",
        "This work proposes a data-driven method for this task with the aim of eliminating the elements of human involvement in the process as much as possible.",
        "The main contribution of this work is a new unsupervised approach for resolving person name ambiguity of web search results based on the use of capitalized n-grams.",
        "In our approach the decision if two web pages have to be grouped only depends on the information of both pages.",
        "In addition, we also propose a heuristic method for the treatment of social media profile web pages in this context.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we discuss related work; Section 3 details the way we represent the web pages, the algorithm and the heuristic for social pages; in Section 4 we describe the collections used for evaluating our method and we show our results making a comparison with other systems; the paper ends with some conclusions and future work in Section 5.",
        "2 Related Work Several approaches have been proposed for clustering search results for a person name query.",
        "The main differences among all of them are the features they use to represent the web pages and the clustering algorithm.",
        "However, the most successful of them have in common that they use some kind of supervision: learning thresholds and/or fixing manually the value of some parameters according to training data.",
        "Regarding the way of representing a web page, the most popular features used by the most successful state of the art approaches are Name Entities (NE) and Bag of Words (BoW) weighted by TF-IDF function.",
        "In addition to such features, the systems usually use other kind of information.",
        "Top systems from WePS-1 and WePS-2 campaigns, CU COMSEM (Chen and Martin, 2007) and PolyUHK (Chen et al., 2009), distinguish several kind of tokens according to different schemes (URL tokens, title tokens, .",
        ".",
        ". )",
        "and build a feature vector for each sort of tokens, using also information based on the noun phrases appearing in the documents.",
        "PolyUHK also adds pattern techniques, attribute extraction and detection when a web page is written in a formal way.",
        "A more recent system, HAC Topic (Liu et al., 2011), also uses BoW of local and global terms weighted by TF-IDF.",
        "It adds a topic capturing method to create a Hit List of shared high weighted tokens for each cluster obtaining better results than WePS-1 participants.",
        "On the other hand, the WePS-3 best system, YHBJ (Chong and Shi, 2010), uses information extracted manually from Wikipedia adding to BoW and NE weighted by TF-IDF.",
        "Regarding the clustering algorithms, looking at WePS campaigns results, the top ranked systems have in common the use of the Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering algorithm (HAC) described in (Man- ning et al., 2008).",
        "Different versions of this algorithm were used by (Chen and Martin, 2007; Chen et al., 2009; Elmacioglu et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2011; Balog et al., 2009; Chong and Shi, 2010).",
        "(Berendsen et al., 2012) presented another gold standard for this task, ECIR2012, composed by Dutch person names and social media profile web pages.",
        "The system of the authors, UvA, distinguishes the web pages between social ones and non social ones, clusters each group separately and then combines both clustering solutions.",
        "They represent each web page as a BoW vector weighted by TF-IDF, and use cosine similarity for comparing web pages.",
        "They use HAC algorithm for clustering non social web pages, while use a ?one in one?",
        "policy for the social ones.",
        "Finally, they mix both groups by means of an algorithm which penalizes clusters with social webs or simply taking the union of both clustering solutions.",
        "They perform a partial parameter sweep on the WePS-2 data set to fix the clustering thresholds, while explore combinations of other system parameters.",
        "The only system that does not use training data, DAEDALUS (Lana-Serrano et al., 2010), which uses k-Medoids, got poor results in WePS-3 campaign.",
        "In short, the successful state of the art systems need some kind of supervised learning using training data or fixing parameters manually.",
        "In this paper we explore and propose an approach to address this problem by means of data-driven techniques without the use of any kind of supervision.",
        "2 http://ilps.science.uva.nl/resources/ecir2012rdwps 302 3 Proposed Approach We distinguish two main phases in this clustering task: web page representation (Sections 3.1 and 3.2) and web page grouping (Sections 3.3 and 3.4).",
        "In addition, we propose an heuristic to deal with social profiles web pages (Section 3.5).",
        "3.1 Feature Selection The aim of this phase is to extract relevant information that could identify an individual.",
        "We assume the main following hypotheses: (i) Capitalized n-grams co-occurrence could be a reliable way for deciding when two web pages refer the same individual.",
        "Capitalized n-grams usually are Named Entities (organizations and company names, locations or other person names related with the individual) or information not detected by some NE recognizers as for example, the title of books, films, TV shows, and so on.",
        "In a previous study with WePS-1 training corpus using the Stanford NER 3 to annotate NE, we detected that only 55.78% of the capitalized tokens were annotated as NE or components of a NE by the NER tool.",
        "So the use of capitalized tokens allows increase the number of features compared to the use of only NE.",
        "We also compared the n-gram representation with capitalized tokens and with NE.",
        "We found that 30.97% of the 3-grams of capitalized tokens were also NE 3-grams, and 25.64% of the 4-grams of capitalized tokens were also NE 4-grams.",
        "So even in the case of n-grams the use of capitalized tokens increases the number of features compared to the use of only NE.",
        "Table 1 shows the differences in performance when using n-grams representation with NE or with capitalized tokens.",
        "(ii) If two web pages share capitalized n-grams, the higher is the value of n, the more probable the two web pages refer to the same individual.",
        "In this case we define ?long enough n-grams?",
        "as those compose by at least 3 capitalized tokens.",
        "Thus, a web page W is initially represented as the sequence of tokens starting in uppercase, in the order as they appear in the web page.",
        "In each step of the algorithm, a web pageW will be represented by its long enough n-grams, taking different values for n, as we describe in Section 3.4.",
        "Notice that some web pages could not be represented with this proposal because all their content was written in lowercase.",
        "In the case of the collections that we describe in Section 4.1, 0.63% of the web pages are not represented for this reason.",
        "3.2 Weighting Functions We test the well known TF and TF-IDF functions, and z-score (Andrade and Medina, 1998).",
        "The z-score of a n-gram a in a web page W i is defined as follows: z-score(a,W i ) = TF (a,W i )??",
        "?",
        ", where TF (a,W i ) is the frequency of the n-gram a in W i ; ?",
        "is the mean frequency of the background set; and ?",
        "is the standard deviation of the background set.",
        "In this context the background set is the set of web pages that share the person name.",
        "This score gives an idea of the distance of the frequency of an n-gram in a web page from the general distribution of this n-gram in the background set.",
        "3.3 Similarity Functions To determine the similarity between two web pages we try the cosine distance, a widely measure used in clustering, and the weighted Jaccard coefficient between two bags of n-grams defined as W.Jaccard(W n i ,W n j ) = ?",
        "k min(m(t n k i ,i),m(t n k j ,j)) ?",
        "k max(m(t n k i ,i),m(t n k j ,j)) , where the meaning of m(t n k i , i) is explained in Section 3.4.",
        "Since weighted Jaccard coefficient needs non-negative entries and we want the cosine similarity of two documents to range from 0 to 1, we translate the values of the z-score so that they are always non-negative.",
        "3.4 Algorithm The algorithm UPND (Unsupervised Person Name Disambiguator) can be seen in Algorithm 1.",
        "The description of this first algorithm does not take into account social profile web pages.",
        "3 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml 303 UPND algorithm receives as input a set of web documents with a mention to the same person name, let beW = {W 1 ,W 2 , .",
        ".",
        ".",

        ".",
        ", (t n k i ,m(t n k i , i))}, where each t n r is a n-gram extracted from W i and m(t n r , i) is the corresponding weight of the n-gram t n r in the web page W i , being r ?",
        "{1, 2, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", k i }.",
        "In Algorithm 1 the function setNGrams(n,W) in line 6 calculates for each web page in the set W its bag of n-grams representation.",
        "Sim(W n i ,W n j ) in line 9 refers to the similarity between web pages W i and W j .",
        "To decide when two web pages refer the same individual we propose a threshold ?.",
        "For each pair of web pages represented as bag of n-grams, let be W n i and W n j , we compute the threshold as fol-lows: ?",
        "(W n i ,W n j ) = min(m,k)?shared(W n i ,W n j ) max(m,k) , where m and k are the number of n-grams of W i and W j respectively, and shared(W n i ,W n j ) is the number of n-grams shared by those web pages i.e. shared(W n i ,W n j ) = |W n i ?W n j |.",
        "Notice that shared(W n i ,W n j ) is superiorly limited by min(m, k).",
        "This threshold holds two desirable properties: (i) The more n-grams are shared by W i and W j , the lower ?",
        "(W n i ,W n j ) is, so the clustering condition of the algorithm is less strict.",
        "(ii) It avoids the penalization due to big differences between the size of the web pages.",
        "Thus, we decide that two web pages W i and W j refer to the same person if Sim(W n i ,W n j ) ?",
        "?",
        "(W n i ,W n j ), so C i = C i ?",
        "C j (lines 9, 10 and 11).",
        "We assume that we can get accurate and reliable information for disambiguating with n-grams of at least size 3.",
        "Thus, we propose to iterate this process for 3-grams and 4-grams, i.e. UPND( W, 3, 4).",
        "We consider that selecting a value of n grater than 4 could lead to find few n-grams, so that many web pages could be under-represented.",
        "On the other hand, previous experiments using also bigrams showed that they are not suitable for this approach.",
        "This algorithm is polynomial and has a computational cost in O(N 2 ), where N is the number of web pages.",

        "This fact affects this task mainly in two ways.",
        "On one hand, as a result of the success of this kind of platforms, 304 a lot of web pages contain terms related to them (e.g. the name of these platforms: Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.).",
        "On the other hand, for a person name query in a search engine, it usually returns several profiles of such person name that are as much in the same as in different social networking services.",
        "These profiles usually are from different people sharing the same name, so they should be in different clusters.",
        "Most of the methods of the state of the art do not take into account this fact, usually taking as features tokens from the URL or the title of each web page, which includes the name of these platforms.",
        "This practice could lead to add noise to the representation of the web pages.",
        "(Berendsen et al., 2012) proposed the ?one in one?",
        "baseline to deal with social platform web pages, which creates a singleton cluster for each social web page.",
        "However, its main disadvantage is that it does not consider that a same individual could have accounts in several social platforms.",
        "A search engine could also return web pages from a social platform which are not profiles, as for example, a group page of Facebook where a person expounds an opinion, in addition to the profile of the same individual in that social platform.",
        "In these cases the ?one in one?",
        "baseline also fails.",
        "We propose a heuristic method that takes into account the limitations of the ?one in one?",
        "heuristic, letting group social web pages from different platforms and also cluster social web pages from the same social platform.",
        "The algorithm that implements our heuristic is SUPND (Social UPND).",
        "This algorithm applies UPND with the following restriction: two web pages assigned to the same social networking service cannot be compared.",
        "This policy is taken because when a search engine returns several links from the same social platform, they usually refer to different individuals.",
        "However, this does not necessarily imply that two web pages belonging to the same social site cannot belong to the same cluster, because they would be compared to other webs pages separately, possibly ending up in the same cluster in a transitive way.",
        "For example, giving two web pages from Facebook, let be FB 1 and FB 2 , and a non-social web page W , then FB 1 and FB 2 would not be compared, however each FB i would be compared with W .",
        "If SUPND decides to cluster each FB i with W , then finally both web pages, from the same platform, would be in the same cluster.",
        "To identify the social web pages we obtain a list of social media platforms from Wikipedia 4 , so when looking at the URL of a web page, we can detect if it corresponds to any of those social media platforms.",
        "If it is the case, we assign to that web page its social media site.",
        "The computational cost of SUPND is the same of UPND.",
        "4 Experiments In this section we present the corpora of web pages used, the preprocessing of each web page, the experiments carried out and the obtained results.",
        "4.1 Web People Search Collections WePS is a competitive evaluation campaign that proposes several tasks including resolution of disambiguation on the Web data.",
        "In particular, WePS-1, WePS-2 and WePS-3 campaigns provide an evaluation framework consisting in several annotated data sets composed of English person names.",
        "In these experiments we use WePS-1 (Artiles et al., 2007) test corpus composed by 30 English person names and the top 100 search results from Yahoo!",
        "search engine; WePS-2 (Artiles et al., 2009a) containing 30 person names and the top 150 search results from Yahoo!",
        "search engine; and WePS-3 (Artiles et al., 2010) containing 300 person names and the top 200 search results from Yahoo!",
        "All WePS corpora have few social profile web pages, so the impact of this kind of pages in the results of the algorithms is insignificant.",
        "We also use the ECIR2012 corpus, which is composed by 33 Dutch person names selected from query logs of a people search engine.",
        "For each person name the web pages set is built retrieving several profiles from social media platforms as Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn, and results returned by Google, Bing and Yahoo!",
        "search engines.",

        "For each not discarded web page, we delete the name and the surname because they appear in all the remaining documents and are the object of the ambiguity.",
        "We also delete stop words.",
        "4.3 Results and Discussion We present our results for all the corpora comparing them with the state of the art systems.",
        "The figures in the tables are macro-averaged, i.e., they are calculated for each person name and then averaged over all test cases.",
        "For WePS data sets we get the same results for UPND and SUPND algorithms, because these collections include few social networking profiles.",
        "The metrics used in this section are the BCubed metrics defined in (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998): BCubed precision (BP ), BCubed recall (BR) and their harmonic mean F 0.5 (BP/BR).",
        "(Artiles, 2009) showed that these metrics are accurate for clustering tasks, particularly for person name disambiguation in the Web.",
        "We use the Wilcoxon test (Wilcoxon, 1945) to detect statistical significance in the differences of the results considering a confidence level of 95%.",
        "In order to compare our algorithm with the WePS better results using the Wilcoxon test, the samples consist in the pairs of values F ?=0.5 (BP/BR) of each system for each person name.",
        "First, Table 1 shows the results of UPND using n-grams of capitalized tokens and n-grams of NE with WePS-1 training corpus.",

        "The results of using n-grams of NE rank below those obtained with n-grams of capitalized tokens in all cases.",
        "The Wilcoxon test comparing the results of both representations shows that there are significant differences between them, except TF and TF-IDF with cosine.",
