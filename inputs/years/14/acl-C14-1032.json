        "He noticed that the number of words w(n) which occur exactly n times in a language corpus varies with n as w(n) ?",
        "1/n ?",
        ", where the exponent is close to 2, which results in the well known Zipf's law.",
        "The general form of Zipf's law states that: y = f(r) = C r ?",
        "(1) where ?",
        "is a positive parameter close to 1.",
        "Zipf showed that, by and large, his law held for words, syllables and morphemes.",
        "Consequently, it is natural to ask if the law also holds for pairs of words.",
        "Egghe devised a mathematical argument that it, in fact, does not, but that the exact relation can be approximated by a power law (Egghe, 1999).",
        "He extended his investigations to parts of words, namely to the study of N-grams (Egghe, 2000).",
        "Zipfs law was the source of a lively debate related to the structure of DNA.",
        "It was claimed (Mantegna et al., 1994) that Zipf's law shows the difference between coding and non-coding DNA as non-coding (so-called junk) DNA fits Zipf's law much better than coding DNA.",
        "This would mean, according to the authors, that non-coding regions of DNA may carry new biological information.",
        "Yet, this does not mean that junk DNA is a kind of language.",
        "Other scientists (Chatzidimitriou-Dreismann et al., 1996), however, have shown that this distinction is not universal and lacks all biological basis.",
        "Zipf's law has been tested on the Internet.",
        "It turned out that popularity of Internet pages is described according to Zipf's law.",
        "This fact can be used to design better cache tables (Masaki and Takahashi, 1998; Breslau et al., 1998; Adamic and Huberman, 2002).",
        "Zipf's studies on city sizes still lead to new developments in geographical and economical studies (Gabaix, 1999a; Gabaix, 1999b; Okuyama et al., 1999; Ioannides and Overman, 2003; Soo, 2005; Soo, 2007).",
        "Back to text, Li (1992) found that the distribution of word frequencies for randomly generated texts is very similar to Zipf's law observed in natural languages such as English (Li, 1992).",
        "Ha et al. (2002) investigated the law for two languages English and Mandarin and for n-gram word phrases as well as for single words.",
        "The law for single words is shown to be valid only for high frequency words.",
        "However, when single word and n-gram phrases are combined together in one list and put in order of frequency the combined list follows Zipf's law accurately for all words and phrases, down to the lowest frequencies in both languages.",
        "The Zipf curves for the two languages are then almost identical (Ha et al., 2002).",
        "In recent years, researchers also made statistics on Tibetan.",
        "Jiang and Dong (1994) made statistics on the length and different structural mode of Tibetan syllables, and counted up the number of initial clusters and finals of Tibetan syllables, as well as the number of Tibetan letters at different positions in syllables (Jiang and Dong, 1994; Jiang and Dong, 1995).",
        "In a further research Jiang (1998; Jiang and Kong (2006; Jiang and Long (2010) , they made statistics on Tibetan letters, and found that the 1th order and 2nd order entropy of Tibetan is 3.9913 bits and 1.2531 bits resplectively (Jiang, 1998), while on super character they are 4.82 and 3.12 (Jiang and Kong, 2006; Jiang and Long, 2010).",
        "Wang and Chen (2004) made similar research to calculate the frequency and information entropy of Tibetan character and syllable based on a corpus of 20, 000, 000 characters, and discovered that the most frequent 703 Tibetan syllables cover 90% of the corpus (Wang and Chen, 2004).",
        "She also presented the research on the frequency-rank relation of Tibetan super character and syllable, and found that the distributions follow Zipf's law too (Wang, 2004).",
        "But no further research is reported on whether she tests Zipf's law on larger language units of Tibetan.",
        "Other researchers also made statistics on Tibetan syllable's structural mode based a static corpus such as syllable list or dictionary (Gao and Gong, 2005; Ai et al., 2009).",
        "Lu et al. (2003) presented the theories and approaches to calculate the frequencies of Tibetan characters, pieces, syllables and words based on a large scale Tibetan corpus including about 40, 000, 000 syllables (Lu et al., 2003).",
        "However, a large part of the corpus they used are Buddhist literatures and the work can't be done well without a pragmatic Tibetan word segmentation tool (Chen et al., 2003a; Chen et al., 2003b; Jiang, 2006; Jiang and Kong, 2006; Sun et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2010; Lu and Shi, 2011; Liu et al., 2012a).",
        "324 At present, people already find methods to build a large scale corpus from Tibetan web sites with low cost.",
        "Liu et al. (2012b) presented their method to extract the title, content, author and other useful information of articles from several news and broadcasting web sites (Liu et al., 2012b).",
        "It's not a difficult work to implement a pragmatic Tibetan word segmentation tool based on the former researches (Chen et al., 2003a; Chen et al., 2003b; Sun et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2012a) So it's time to make statistics on the frequency distribution of larger language units such as word and n-gram word phrase for Tibetan to see whether they follow Zipf's law.",
        "4 Methods and Corpus We present our methods to build the corpus and to segment Tibetan text into different units mentioned above.",
        "4.1 Building a Large Scale Tibetan Text Corpus Previously Liu et al. (2012b) proposed an approach to build a large scale text corpus for Tibetan natural language processing.",
        "We adopt the method to build our corpus.",
        "we crawled eight Tibetan websites which mainly focus on news and broadcastings.",
        "Topic pages but hub pages are selected with a rule based method by checking the url.",
        "We analysed the layout structure mode of each web site and built templates to extract topic title, publishing date, author, topic content and some other topic related informations.",
