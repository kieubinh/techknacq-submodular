        "Readability assessment is a research line that aims to grade the difficulty or the ease of the texts.",
        "It has been a remarkable question in the educational domain during the last century and is of great importance in Natural Language Processing (NLP) during the last decade.",
        "Classical readability formulae like Flesh formula (Flesch, 1948), Dale-Chall formula (Chall and Dale, 1995) and The Gunning FOG index (Gun- ning, 1968) take into account raw and lexical features and frequency counts.",
        "NLP techniques, on the other hand, make possible the consideration of more complex features.",
        "Recent research in NLP (Si and Callan, 2001; Petersen and Ostendorf, 2009; Feng, 2009) has demonstrated that classical readability formulae are unreliable.",
        "Moreover, those metrics are language specific.",
        "Readability assessment is also used as a preprocess or evaluation in Text Simplification (TS) systems e.g. for English (Feng et al., 2010), Portuguese (Alu?",
        "?sio et al., 2010), Italian (Dell?Orletta et al., 2011), German (Hancke et al., 2012) and Spanish ( ?",
        "Stajner and Saggion, 2013).",
        "Given a text the aim of these systems is to decide whether a text is complex or not.",
        "So, in case of being difficult, the given text should be simplified.",
        "As far as we know no specific metric has been used to calculate the complexity of Basque texts.",
        "The only exception we find is a system for the auto-evaluation of essays Idazlanen Autoebaluaziorako Sistema (IAS) (Aldabe et al., 2012) which includes metrics similar to those used in readability assessment.",
        "IAS analyses Basque texts after several criteria focused on educational correction such as the clause number in a sentence, types of sentences, word types and lemma number among others.",
        "It was foreseen to use this tool in the Basque TS system (Aranzabe et al., 2012).",
        "The present work means to add to IAS the capacity of evaluating the complexity of texts by means of new linguistic features and criteria.",
        "In this paper we present ErreXail, a readability assessment system for Basque, a Pre-Indo-European agglutinative head-final pro-drop language, which displays a rich inflectional morphology and whose orthography is phonemic.",
        "ErreXail classifies the texts and decides if they should be simplified or not.",
        "This work has two objectives: to build a classifier which will be the preprocess of the TS system and to know which are the most predictive features that differ in complex and simple texts.",
        "The study of the most predictive features will help in the linguistic analysis of the complex structures of Basque as well.",
        "This paper is organised as follows: In section 2 we offer an overview about this topic.",
        "We present the corpora we gathered and its processing in section 3.",
        "In section 4 we summarise the linguistic features we ",
        "334 implemented and we present the experiments and their results in section 5.",
        "The present system, ErreXail, is described in section 6 and in section 7 we compare our work with other studies.",
        "Finally, we conclude and outline the future work (section 8).",
        "2 Related work In the last years new methods have been proposed to assess the readability in NLP.",
        "For English, Si and Callan (2001) use statistical models, exactly unigram language models, combined with traditional readability features like sentence length and number of syllables per word.",
        "Coh-Metrix (Graesser et al., 2004) is a tool that analyses multiple characteristics and levels of language-discourse such us narrativity, word concreteness or noun overlap.",
        "In the 3.0 version 1 108 indices are available.",
        "Pitler and Nenkova (2008) use lexical, syntactic, and discourse features emphasising the importance of discourse features as well.",
        "Schwarm and Ostendorf (2005) combine features from statistical language models, parse features, and other traditional features using support vector machines.",
        "It is very interesting to take a look at readability systems for other languages as well.",
        "Some readability metrics take them into account special characteristics linked to languages.",
        "For example, in Chinese the number of strokes is considered (Pang, 2006), in Japanese the different characters (Sato et al., 2008), in German the word formation (vor der Br?uck et al., 2008), in French the pass?e simple (Franc?ois and Fairon, 2012) and the orthographic neighbourhood (Gala et al., 2013) and in Swedish vocabulary resources (Sj?oholm, 2012; Falkenjack et al., 2013) among many other features.",
        "For Portuguese, Coh-metrix has been adapted (Scarton and Alu?",
        "?sio, 2010) and in Arabic language-specific formulae have been used (Al- Ajlan et al., 2008; Daud et al., 2013).",
        "Looking at free word order, head final and rich morphology languages, Sinha et al. (2012) propose two new measures for Hindi and for Bangla based on English formulae.",
        "Other systems use only machine learning techniques, e.g. for Chinese (Chen et al., 2011).",
        "The systems whose motivation is Text Simplification analyse linguistic features of the text and then they use machine learning techniques to build the classifiers.",
        "These systems have been created for English (Feng et al., 2010), Portuguese (Alu?",
        "?sio et al., 2010), Italian (Dell?Orletta et al., 2011) and German (Hancke et al., 2012).",
        "We follow the similar methodology for Basque since we share the same aim.",
        "Readability assessment can be focused on different domains such as legal, medical, education and so on.",
        "Interesting points about readability are presented in DuBay (2004) and an analysis of the methods and a review of the systems is presented in Benjamin (2012) and Zamanian and Heydari (2012).",
        "3 Corpora Being our aim to build a model to distinguish simple and complex texts and to know which are the most predictive features based on NLP techniques, we needed to collect the corpora.",
        "We gathered texts from the web and compiled two corpora.",
        "The first corpus, henceforth T-comp, is composed by 200 texts (100 articles and 100 analysis) from the Elhuyar aldizkaria 2 , a monthly journal about science and technology in Basque.",
        "T-comp is meant to be the complex corpus.",
        "The second corpus, henceforth T-simp, is composed by 200 texts from ZerNola 3 , a website to popularise science among children up to 12 years and the texts we collected are articles.",
        "To find texts specially written for children was really challenging.",

        "We distinguish different groups of features: global, lexical, morphological, morpho-syntactic, syntactic and pragmatic features.",
        "There are in total 94 features.",
        "Most of the features we present have already been included in systems for other languages but others have been specially considered for Basque.",
        "4.1 Global features Global features take into account the document as whole and serve to give an overview of the texts.",
        "They are presented in Table 2.",
        "Averages Average of words per sentence Average of clauses per sentence Average of letters per word Table 2: Global features These features are based on classical readability formulae and in the criteria taken on the simplification study (Gonzalez-Dios, 2011), namely the sentence length and the clause number per sentence.",
        "They are also included in IAS (Aldabe et al., 2012).",
        "4.2 Lexical features Lexical features are based on lemmas.",
        "We calculate the ratios of all the POS tags and different kinds of abbreviations and symbols.",
        "We concentrate on particular types of substantives and verbs as well.",
        "Part of theses ratios are shown in Table 3.",
        "In total there are 39 ratios in this group.",
        "Ratios Unique lemmas / all the lemmas Each POS / all the words Proper Nouns / all the nouns Named entities / all the nouns Verbal nouns / all the verbs Modal verbs / all the verbs Causative verbs / all the verbs Intransitive verbs with one arg.",
        "(Nor verbs) / all the verbs Intransitive verbs with two arg.",
        "(Nor-Nori verbs) / all the verbs Transitive verbs with two arg.",
        "(Nor-Nork verbs) / all the verbs Transitive verbs with three arg.",
        "(Nor-Nori-Nork) verbs / all the verbs Acronyms / all the words Abbreviations / all the words Symbols / all the words Table 3: Lexical features Among those features, we want to point out the causative verbs and the intransitive or transitive verbs with one, two or three arguments (arg.)",
        "as features related to Basque.",
        "Causative verbs are verbs with the 336 suffix -arazi and they are usually translated as ?to make someone + verb?, e.g. edanarazi, that stands for ?to make someone drink?.",
        "Other factitive verbs are translated without using that paraphrase like jakinarazi that means ?to notify?, lit.",
        "?to make know?.",
        "The transitivity classification is due to the fact that Basque verb agrees with three grammatical cases (ergative Nork, absolutive Nor and dative Nori) and therefore verbs are grouped according to the arguments they take in Basque grammars.",
        "4.3 Morphological features Morphological features analyse the different ways lemmas can be realised.",
        "These features are summarised in Table 4 and there are 24 ratios in total.",
        "Ratios Each case ending / all the case endings Each verb aspect / all the verbs Each verb tense / all the verbs Each verb mood / all the verbs Words with ellipsis / all the words Each type of words with ellipsis / all the words with ellipsis Table 4: Morphological features Basque has 18 case endings (absolutive, ergative, inessive, allative, genitive...), that is, 18 different endings can be attached to the end of the noun phrases.",
        "For example, if we attach the inessive -n to the noun phrase etxea ?the house?, we get etxean ?at home?.",
        "The verb features considered the forms obtained with the inflection.",
        "Verb morphology is very rich in Basque as well.",
        "The aspect is attached to the part of the verb which contains the lexical information.",
        "There are 4 aspects: puntual (aoristic), perfective, imperfective and future aspect.",
        "Verb tenses are usually marked in the auxiliary verb and there are four tenses: present, past, irreal and archaic future 4 .",
        "The verbal moods are indicative, subjunctive, imperative and potential.",
        "The latter is used to express permissibility or possible circumstances.",
        "Due to the typology of Basque, ellipsis 5 is a normal phenomenon and ellipsis can be even found within a word (verbs, nouns, adjective...); for instance, dioguna which means ?what we say?.",
        "This kind of ellipsis occurs e.g. in English, Spanish, French and German as well but in these languages it is realised as a sentence; but it is expressed only by a word in Basque.",
        "4.4 Morpho-syntactic features Morpho-syntactic features are based on the shallow parsing (chunks 6 ) and in the apposition detection (appositions).",
        "These features are presented in Table 5.",
        "Ratios Noun phrases (chunks) / all the phrases Noun phrases (chunks) / all the sentences Verb phrases / all the phrases Appositions / all the phrases Appositions / all the noun phrases (chunks) Table 5: Morpho-syntactic features Contrary to the features so far presented, the morpho-syntactic features take into account mainly more than a word.",
        "About apposition, there are 2 types in Basque (Gonzalez-Dios et al., 2013) but we consider all the instances together in this work.",
        "4 The archaic future we also take into account is not used anymore, but it can be found in old texts.",
        "Nowadays, the aspect is used to express actions in the future.",
        "5 Basque is a pro-drop language and it is very normal to omit the subject, the object and the indirect object because they are marked in the verb.",
        "We do not treat this kind of ellipsis in the present work.",
        "6 Chunks are a continuum of elements with a head and syntactic sense that do not overlap (Abney, 1991).",
        "337 4.5 Syntactic features Syntactic features consider average of the subordinate clauses and types of subordinate clauses.",
        "They are outlined in Table 6 and there are 10 ratios in total.",
        "The types of adverbial clauses are temporal, causal, conditional, modal, concessive, consecutive and modal-temporal.",
        "The latter is a clause type which expresses manner and simultaneity of the action in reference to the main clause.",
        "Ratios Subordinate clauses / all the clauses Relative clauses / subordinate clauses Completive clauses / subordinate clauses Adverbial clauses / subordinate clauses Each type of adverbial clause / subordinate clauses Table 6: Syntactic features In this first approach we decided not to use dependency based features like dependency depth or distance from dependent to head because dependency parsing is time consuming and slows down the preprocessing.",
        "Moreover, the importance of syntax is under discussion: Petersen and Ostendorf (2009) find that syntax does not have too much influence while Sj?oholm (2012) shows that dependencies are not necessary.",
        "Pitler and Nenkova (2008) pointed out the importance of syntax.",
        "but Dell?Orletta et al. (2011) demonstrate that for document classification reliable results can be found without syntax.",
        "Anyway, syntax is necessary for sentence classification.",
        "4.6 Pragmatic features In our cases, the pragmatic features we examine are the cohesive devices.",
        "These features are summed up in Table 7.",
        "There are 12 ratios in total.",
        "Ratios Each type of conjunction / all the conjunctions Each type of sentence connector / all the sentence connectors Table 7: Pragmatic features Conjunction types are additive, adversative and disjuntive.",
        "Sentence connector types are additive, adversative, disjuntive, clarificative, causal, consecutive, concessive and modal.",
        "5 Experiments We performed two experiments, the first one to build a classifier and the second one to know which are the most predictive features.",
        "For both tasks we used the WEKA tool (Hall et al., 2009).",
        "In the first experiment we ran 5 classifiers and evaluated their performance.",
        "Those classifiers were Random Forest (Breiman, 2001), the J48 decision tree (Quinlan, 1993), K-Nearest Neighbour, IBk (Aha et al., 1991), Na?",
        "?ve Bayes (John and Langley, 1995) and Support Vector Machine with SMO algorithm (Platt, 1998).",
        "We used 10 fold cross-validation, similar to what has been done in other studies.",
        "Taking into account all the features presented in section 4, the best results were obtained using SMO.",
        "This way, 89.50 % of the instances were correctly classified.",
        "The F -measure for complex text was 0.899 %, for simple texts was 0.891 % and the MAE was 0.105 %.",

        "In the second experiment, we analysed which were the most predictive linguistic features in each group.",

        "They experiment with feature types as well but they obtain their best results using all the features.",
        "Among their highly correlated features they present the incidence of apposition in second place as we do here.",
        "We do not have any other feature in common.",
        "Among other readability assessment whose motivation is TS, Feng et al. (2010) use LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2001) and Logistic Regression from WEKA and 10 fold cross-validation.",
        "They assess the readability of grade texts and obtain as best results 59.63 % with LIBSVM and 57.59 % with Logistic Regression.",
        "Since they assess different grades and use other classifiers it is impossible to compare with our results but we find that we share predictive features.",
        "They found out that named entity density and and nouns have predictive power as well.",
        "8 Conclusion and perspectives In this paper we have presented the first readability assessment system for the Basque language.",
        "We have implemented 94 ratios based on linguistic features similar to those used in other languages and specially defined for Basque and we have built a classifier which is able to discriminate between difficult and easy texts.",
        "We have also determined which are the most predictive features.",
        "From our experiments we conclude that using only lexical features or a combination of features types we obtain better results than using all the features.",
        "Moreover, we deduce that we do not need to use time consuming resources like dependency parsing or big corpora to obtain good results.",
        "For the future, we could implement new features like word formation or word ordering both based in other languages and in neurolinguistic studies that are being carried out for Basque.",
        "Other machine learning techniques can be used, e.g. language models and in the case of getting a bigger corpora or a graded one, we could even try to differentiate more reading levels.",
        "We also envisage readability assessment at sentence level in near future.",
