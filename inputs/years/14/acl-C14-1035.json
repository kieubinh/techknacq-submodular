        "Word Sense Induction (WSI) aims to automatically induce meanings of a polysemous word from unlabeled corpora.",
        "It discriminates among meanings of a word by identifying clusters of similar contexts.",
        "Unlike the task of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), which classifies polysemous words according to a pre-existing and usually hand-crafted inventory of senses, WSI makes it attractive to researchers by eliminating dependence on a particular sense inventory and learning word meaning distinction directly based on the contexts as observed in corpora.",
        "Almost all WSI work relies on the distributional hypothesis, which states that words occurring in similar contexts will have similar meanings.",
        "To effectively discriminate among contexts, proper representation of contexts would be a key issue.",
        "Basically, context can be represented as a vector of words co-occurring with the target word within a fixed context window.",
        "The similarity between two contexts of the target word can then be measured by the geometrical distance between the corresponding vectors.",
        "To ease the sparse problem and capture more semantic content, some kinds of generalizations or abstractions are needed.",
        "For example, a context of bank including money may not share similarity with that including cash measured at word level.",
        "However, given the conceptual relationship between money and cash, the two contexts actually share high similarity.",
        "One straightforward way of introducing conceptualization is to assign semantic code to context words, where semantic codes could be derived from WordNet or other resources like thesauruses.",
        "However, two problems remain to be tackled.",
        "The first one concerns ambiguities of context words.",
        "Context words may have multiple semantic codes and thus word sense disambiguation to context words or other extra cost is needed.",
        "The second one concerns the nature of WSI task.",
        "WSI actually is target-word-specific, which means the conceptualization should be done specifically to different target words.",
        "A general purpose conceptualization defined by a thesaurus may not well meet this requirement and may not be equally successful in discriminating contexts of different target words.",
        "To address these problems, we first propose a parametric Bayesian model which jointly finds conceptual representations of context words and the sense of the target word.",
        "We do this by introducing a layer of target-specific conceptual representation between the target sense layer and the context words layer This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "355 Figure 1: Architecture of our model Figure 2: Graphical notation of the Basic Model through a Bayesian framework as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "From the generative perspective, the sense of the target word is first sampled.",
        "Then the sense generates different conceptual configurations which in turn generate different contexts.",
        "With a deeper architecture, our model makes it possible to induce word senses at a more abstract level, i.e. the concept level, which is not only less sparse but also more semantically oriented.",
        "Both the senses of the target word and the latent concepts are inferred automatically and unsupervisedly with inference procedure given enough contexts involving a target word.",
        "The latent concepts inferred with the model share similarities with those defined in thesauruses, as both of them cluster semantically related words.",
        "However, since the latent concepts are inferred with regard to individual target words, they are target-word-specific and thus fit the WSI task better than general purpose concepts defined in thesauruses.",
        "Context words may still correspond to multiple latent concepts.",
        "However, the disambiguation is implicitly done in the process of the word sense induction.",
        "Setting the number of senses that the algorithm should arrive at is another problem frequently exercising the minds of WSI people.",
        "Instead of trying different sense numbers on a word-by-word basis, we propose to use Zipf's law of meaning (Zipf, 1945) to guide the selection of the sense numbers in this paper.",
        "With the law of meaning, sense numbers could be set on an all-word basis, rather than on a word-by-word basis.",
        "This is not only simple but also efficient, especially in the case where there are a large number of target words to be concerned.",
        "We further extend the parametric model into a non-parametric model, as it allows adaptation of model complexity to data.",
        "By extending our model to non-parametric model, the need to preset the numbers of senses and latent concepts are totally removed and, moreover, the model performance is also improved.",
        "We evaluate our model on the commonly used benchmark datasets released by both Semeval-2010 (Manandhar et al., 2010) and Semeval-2007 (Agirre and Soroa, 2007).",
        "The test results show that our models perform much better than the state-of-the-art systems.",
        "2 The parametric model 2.1 Basic Model The main point of our work is that different senses are signaled by contexts with different concept con-figurations, where different concepts are formally defined as different distributions over context words.",
        "Formally, we denote by P (s) the global multinomial distribution over senses of an ambiguous word and by P (w|z) the multinomial distributions over context words w given concept z.",
        "Context words are generated by a mixture of different concepts whose mixture proportion is defined by P (z|s), such that: P (w i ) = ?",
        "j P (s = j) ?",
        "k P (z i = k|s = j)P (w i |z i = k) Following the model, each context word w i surrounding the target word is generated as follows: First, a sense s is sampled from P (s) for the target word.",
        "Then for each context word position i, a concept z i is sampled according to mixture proportion P (z|s) and w i is finally sampled from P (w|z).",
        "Figure 2 shows the model with the graphical notation, where M is the number of instances of contexts regarding to a concerned target word and N m is the number of word tokens in context m. s m is the sense label for target word in context m. w m,n is the n-th context word in context m. z m,n is the concept label associated with w m,n .",
        "I is the total number of senses to be induced.",
        "J is the total number 356 Figure 3: Graphical notation of the non-parametric WSI model of concepts.",
        "~ ?",
        "is the notational shorthand for the sense distribution P (s), ~?",
        "i is the shorthand for the i-th sense-concept distribution P (z|s = i), and ~?",

        "i and ~?",
        "j are assumed to be drawn from Dirichlet priors with symmetric parameter ?, ?, ?",
        "respectively.",
        "The observed variable is represented with shaded node and hidden variable with unshaded node.",
        "2.2 Zipf's law of meaning Most of the WSI work requires that the number of senses to be induced be specified ahead of time.",
        "One straightforward way to deal with this problem is to repeatedly try different numbers of senses on a development set and select the best performed number.",
        "However, this should be done in principle on a word-by-word basis, and thus could be time-consuming and prohibitive when there are lots of target words to be concerned.",
        "A more systematic way of setting sense numbers in Bayesian models is extending the parametric model into a non-parametric model, which will be described in detail in section 3.",
        "To work with our parametric model, we propose in this paper that an empirical law, Zipf's law of meaning (Zipf, 1945), could be used to guide the sense number selection.",
        "Zipf's law of meaning states that the number of sense of a word is proportional to its frequency as shown in the following equation: I = K ?",
        "f b (1) where I is the number of word senses and f is the frequency of the word.",
        "K is the coefficient of proportionality which is unknown and b is about 0.404 according to an experimental study done by Edmonds (2006).",
        "Certainly, Zipf's law of meaning is not as strict as a rigorous mathematical law.",
        "However, it sketches the distribution of the sense numbers with word frequencies of all words and allows us to estimate the sense numbers on an all-word basis by selecting appropriate coefficient K. This is not only simple but also efficient, especially in the case that there are a large number of target words to be concerned.",
        "3 Non-parametric Model A limitation of the parametric model is that the sense number I of the target word and the number J of latent concepts need to be fixed beforehand.",
        "Bayesian non-parametric (BNP) models offer elegant approach to the problem of model selection and adaption.",
        "Rather than comparing models that vary in complexity, the BNP approach is to fit a single model that can adapt its complexity to the data.",
        "Unlike the parametric approach, BNP approach assumes an infinite number of clusters, among which only a few are active given the training data.",
        "Our basic model can be naturally extended into a BNP model as shown in Figure 3.",
        "Instead of assuming a finite number of senses, we place a nonparametric, Dirichlet process (DP) prior on the sense distribution as follows: G ?",

        "By using HDP priors, we make sure that the same set of concept-word distributions is shared across all senses and all contexts of a target word, since each random measure G i inherits its set of concepts from the same G 0 .",
        "As in parametric model, ~?",
        "j is the j-th concept-word distribution P (w|z = j), however, there are now an infinite number of such distributions.",
        "So is the number of senses.",
        "However, with a fixed number of contexts of the target word, only a finite number of senses and concepts are active and they could be inferred automatically by the inference procedure.",

        "Our model could be viewed as an extension of LDA, but fit the WSI task more naturally and much better.",
        "We distinguish senses of target words from concepts of context words and assume that they are separate.",
        "Therefore, our model has two hidden layers corresponding to the sense of the target word and the concepts of the context words respectively.",

        "7 Conclusion In this paper, we first proposed a parametric Bayesian generative model to the task of Word Sense Induction.",
        "It is distinct from previous work in that it introduces a layer of latent concepts that generalize the context words and thus enable the model to measure the sense similarity at a more general level.",
        "We also show in this paper that Zipf's law of meaning can be used to guide the setting of sense numbers on an all-word basis, which is not only simple but also independent of the clustering methods being used.",
        "We further extend our parametric model to non-parametric model which not only simplifies the problem of model selection but also bring improved performance.",
