        "Since the translation memory (TM) system and the statistical machine translation (SMT) system complement each other in those matched sub-segments and unmatched sub-segments (Wang et al., 2013), combining them can improve the output quality significantly, especially when high-similarity fuzzy matches are available.",
        "Therefore, combining TM and SMT is drawing more and more attention in recent years (He et al., 2010a; 2010b; 2011; Koehn and Senellart, 2010; Zhechev and van Genabith, 2010; Ma et al., 2011; Dara et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013).",
        "Those previous works on combining TM and SMT can be classified into four categories: (1) selecting the better translation sentence from TM and SMT (He et al., 2010a; 2010b; Dara et al., 2013); (2) incorporating TM matched sub-segments into SMT in a pipelined manner (Koehn and Senellart, 2010; He et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2011); (3) only enhancing the SMT phrase table with new TM phrase-pairs (Bi?ici and Dymetman, 2008; Simard and Isabelle, 2009); and (4) incorporating the associated TM information with each source phrase to guide the SMT decoding (Wang et al., 2013).",
        "However, all previous works mentioned above only focus on the case in which the TM database and the SMT training set share the same data-set.",
        "Nonetheless, in real applications, the TM database will deviate from the SMT training set when time goes by, because the TM database will be dynamically enlarged when more translations are generated by the human translator.",
        "Therefore, this paper will concentrate on a more realistic case, in which the TM database and the SMT training set are different and even from different domains.",
        "When the TM database and the SMT training set share the same data-set, the integrated model (Wang et al., 2013) can avoid the drawbacks of the pipeline approaches and outperforms the other approaches significantly.",
        "However, this integrated model only refers to the TM information but not adopts the matched TM phrase-pairs as candidates during decoding.",

        "It is thus impossible to generate those unseen TM target phrases.",
        "This problem would even get worse when the TM database and the SMT training set are from different domains.",
        "To make the integrated model meet the real application, we dynamically merge the matched TM phrase-pairs into the SMT phrase table.",
        "In addition, an improved integrated model is proposed to distinguish the original SMT phrase-pairs and the newly-added ones extracted from TM.",
        "Furthermore, a simple but effective TM adaptation method is adopted to favor the consistent translation in cross-domain test.",
        "To our best knowledge, this is the first unified framework for integrating TM into SMT during decoding when the TM database and the SMT training set are different (even from different domains).",
        "On the TM database which consists of Chinese?English computer technical documents, our experiments have shown that merging the matched TM phrase-pairs achieves significant improvement when the fuzzy match score is above 0.5.",
        "Besides, the proposed approaches are significantly better than either the SMT or the TM systems for both the in-domain and the cross-domain tests when the fuzzy match score is above 0.4.",
        "Furthermore, the proposed approaches also outperform previous integration works significantly in all test conditions.",

        "With the TM information, this problem can be simplified to: ?",
        "{ ( ?",
        "| ?",
        "( ) ( )) ?",
        "?",

        "), which indicates the matching and linking status in the source side (and is closely related to the matching status of the target side).",
        "is uniformly divided into ten fuzzy match intervals and the index specifies the corresponding interval.",
        "In Equation (1), the first factor is just the typical phrase-based SMT model, and the second factor ( | ) is the information derived from the TM sentence pair.",
        "Afterwards, the factor ( | ) was further derived with TM matching status as follows: ( | ) { ( | ) ( | ) ( | ) } (2) Where the first factor reflects the TM content matching status, the second factor is the relationship between various TM target phrases, and the third factor is the reordering information implied by TM.",
        "Equation (2) is adopted to guide the SMT decoding, and is denoted as the integrated Model-III in (Wang et al., 2013) (also called Model-III in this paper thereafter).",
        "For space limitation, only those features which are also adopted in our additional introduced probability factor (to be specified later) will be briefly introduced here: Target Phrase Content Matching Status (TCM): It indicates the content matching status between ?",
        "and ?",

        "The more similar the context is, the more likely that the translation is the same.",
        "NLN is adopted to measure the context similarity.",
        "3 Proposed Approaches 3.1 Merging the TM Phrase-Pairs Since all TM phrase-pairs are only referred while re-scoring the SMT candidates in Model-III, they are not regarded as candidates during decoding.",
        "When the TM database and the SMT training set are the same, this restriction is reasonable because the SMT phrase table can cover all the continuous TM phrase pairs within the phrase length limit.",
        "However, this would not be true when the TM database and the SMT training set are different.",
        "Therefore, the SMT phrase table should be further enhanced with those matched new TM phrase pairs in this case.",
        "According to their relations with the SMT phrase table, TM phrase pairs can be classified into three different categories: (1) the whole TM phrase-pair can be found in the original SMT phrase table; (2) only TM source phrase exists in the original SMT phrase table, but its corresponding target phrase does not; (3) even TM source phrase cannot be found in the original SMT phrase table.",
        "Since the first category has been covered by the original SMT phrase table, only the phrase-pairs from the second and the third categories should be added into the SMT phrase table dynamically for each input sentence.",
        "To distinguish those newly added phrase-pairs from the original SMT phrase-pairs, we use eight additional feature weights for the translation probability (lexical and phrase transfer in both direc-tions) and two more feature weights for the phrase penalty (details will be specified later in Section 4).",
        "The above approach is inspired by the work of (Bi?ici and Dymetman, 2008).",
        "However, there are three differences between our approach and theirs.",
        "Firstly, we add all those matched TM phrase-pairs (include all associated sub-phrase pairs), while Bi?ici and Dymetman (2008) only added the longest matched one; Secondly, we add all the possible TM target phrase-pairs for a given TM source phrase while they extracted only one TM target phrase regardless of the existence of multiple TM target can-didates; Lastly, we use different feature weights to distinguish those newly added TM phrase-pairs from the original SMT phrase-pairs, while they treated them equally.",
        "3.2 Distinguishing the TM Phrase-Pairs As mentioned in Section 3.1, we need to merge those TM matched phrase pairs into the SMT phrase table when the TM database and the SMT training set are different.",
        "However, the original integrated Model-III does not distinguish the newly added TM phrase-pairs from those original SMT phrase-pairs in ( | ).",
        "Therefore, we introduce two new features Source Phrase Origin (SPO) and Target Phrase Origin (TPO), which are a member of {Original, Newly-Added}, to the original Model-III in (Wang et al., 2013) to favor the newly added TM phrase-pairs, and re-derive ( | ) as follows (assume that TPO is only dependent on SPO, NLN and ): ( | ) ([ ] |[ ] ) { ( | ) ( | ) ( | ) ( | ) } (2) The additional factor ( | ) in the above equation is added to handle those newly added TM phrase-pairs.",
        "This would be the proposed Distinguishing Model.",
        "For the phrases from the original SMT phrase table, both the SPO and TPO features would be ?Original?",
        "; for the phrases from the second category mentioned in Section 3.1, the SPO would be ?Original?",
        "but the TPO would be ?Newly-Added?",
        "; for the phrases from the third category, both the SPO and TPO features would be ?Newly-Added?.",
        "400 3.3 TM Adaptation In real applications, the TM database is usually not big enough to train an SMT system when it is applied to a special technical domain other than the news domain.",
        "Besides, many professional translators do not want to expose the whole TM database to the SMT system providers (Cancedda, 2012).",
        "In this situation, we will be forced to first train an SMT model on an out domain (usually the news domain) which possesses a lot of training data, and then fix the obtained phrase-based SMT model.",
        "Afterwards, we incorporate it on line with an additional TM database which is from another in domain.",
        "To simulate the above scenario, we will thus train our integrated model on the out domain.",
        "However, we have a domain-mismatch problem for this cross-domain test.",
        "Generally, in the technical domain, which is suitable for TM application, the translations (especially for technical terms) are much more consistent than that in the news domain.",
        "That is, the same source phrase in various places tends to have exactly the same translation in technical domains.",
        "Therefore, when we use Distinguishing Model to perform forced decoding, the obtained results would possess different statistics among the in-domain development set and the out-domain training set.",
        "For example, at interval [0.9, 1.0), when SCM is ?Same?, 94.6% of TCM are ?Same?",
        "in the development set (in), while this ratio is only 65.1% in the training set (out).",
        "Therefore, the factor ( | ) from the test set will possess a different probability distribution in comparison with that from the training set.",
        "However, the development set is not big enough (only a few hundreds sentence-pairs at each interval) to re-train all TM factors of the proposed model.",
        "Therefore, we simply add the following h1 feature to reflect the tendency of having high translation consistency in the development set: ( ?",
        "? )",
        "{ Where ?",
        "and ?",
        "denote the source phrase, the target candidate, respectively.",
        "Furthermore, various source synonyms might generate the same translation (Zhu et al., 2013).",
        "Therefore, even SCM?Same, we still favor the SMT phrase-pair candidate which exactly matches TM target phrase.",
        "For example, if source words are synonyms such as ????",
        "(want) and ???",
        "(want), ??",
        "??",
        "(if) and ???",
        "(if), ????",
        "(at once) and ????",
        "(at once), the target translations would be the same.",
        "Therefore, the issue of having high translation consistency in the technical domain is also applied.",
        "We thus further add the following h2 feature to reflect the tendency of having high translation consistency in this case (?High?",
        "and ?Low?",
        "are grouped into ?Other?",
        "for the SCM): ( ?",
        "? )",
        "{ Afterwards, the associated feature weights are tuned on the development set.",
        "4 Experiments 4.1 Experimental Setup We use the same TM data-set adopted by Wang et al. (2013), which is a Chinese?English TM database consisting of computer technical documents.",
        "It includes about 267k sentence pairs.",
        "All the experiments are conducted around this TM data-set.",
        "To compare the performances under different condi-tions, the same development set and the test set will be shared by both in-domain and cross-domain tests.",
        "Since the associated SMT training-set and TM database will vary under different experimental configurations, they will be specified later in each sub-section.",
        "In this work, the translation memory system (denoted as TM) and the phrase-based machine translation system (denoted as SMT) are adopted as our two baseline systems.",
        "Following (Wang et al., 2013), for TM, the word-based fuzzy match score is adopted as the similarity measure; also, for the phrase-based SMT system, the same Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007) and the same set of following features are adopted: the phrase translation model, the language model, the distance-based reordering model, the lexicalized reordering model and the word penalty.",
        "The system configurations are as follows: GI-ZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) is used to obtain the bidirectional word alignments.",
        "Afterwards, ?intersec- tion?",
        "refinement (Koehn et al., 2003) is adopted to extract phrase-pairs.",
        "We use SRI Language Model 401 toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) to train a 5-gram model with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Kneser and Ney, 1995; Chen and Goodman, 1998) on the target-side (English) training corpus.",
        "All the feature weights and the weight for each probability factor are tuned on the development set with minimum-error-rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003).",
        "The maximum phrase length is set to 7 in our experiments.",
        "To compare our proposed models with those state-of-the-art methods, we re-implement two XML-Markup approaches (Koehn and Senellart, 2010; and the upper bound version of (Ma et al., 2011)) and the Model-III (Wang et al., 2013) as three baseline systems, and denote them as Koehn-10, Ma-11-U and Model-III, respectively.",
        "Similar to (Wang et al., 2013), we only re-implement the XML-Markup method used in (Ma et al., 2011), but not their discriminative learning method.",
        "Following (Wang et al., 2013), we also train the TCM, LTC and CPM factors in the SMT training set with cross-fold translation.",
        "Since the TPO factor (conditioning on NLN and Distinguishing Model) is based on Model-III, we first use Model-III to generate the desired results on the development set via forced decoding, and then generate the training samples of TPO factor for Distinguishing Model.",
        "In this work, the translation performance is measured with case-insensitive BLEU-4 score (Papineni et al., 2002) and TER score (Snover et al., 2006).",
        "Statistical significance tests are conducted with re-sampling (1,000 times) approach (Koehn, 2004) in 95% confidence level.",
        "4.2 In-Domain Translation Results In the in-domain test, the original TM dataset is first randomly divided into two parts.",
        "The first part is then adopted as the new TM database, while the second part is adopted as the SMT training set.",
        "The detailed corpus statistics is shown in Table 1.",
        "Since the TM database is different from that adopted in (Wang et al., 2013), the statistics shown in Table 2 at each interval is also different from theirs.",
        "All matched TM phrase-pairs are extracted according to the word alignment generated from the phrase-based SMT system.",
        "Since there are not enough samples to estimate the translation probabilities for those newly added TM phrase-pairs, we use the following method to assign the translation probabilities.",
        "For those TM phrase-pairs that only their source phrases exist in the original SMT phrase table (the second category mentioned in Section 3.1), as their source phrases have already existed in the SMT phrase table, there is at least one associated target phrase in the original SMT phrase table.",
        "For each new TM phrase-pair, we thus directly assign the maximum probability among its associated original target phrases to it.",
        "For those TM phrase-pairs that even their source phrase cannot be found in the original SMT phrase table (the third category), as there is no corresponding phrase-pair in the original SMT phrase table, we will simply assign probability ?1.0?",
        "(this value is not important as its associated weight will be tuned later) as their four translation probabilities.",
        "To distinguish those newly added phrase-pairs from the original SMT phrase-pairs, we use eight additional feature weights for the translation probability and two more feature weights for the phrase penalty.",

        "5 Related Work According to the way of combination, those previous works can be classified into four categories (as specified in Section 1).",
        "The first category uses a classifier (or a re-ranker) to judge whether TM or SMT gives a better translation sentence, and then delivers the better one to the post-editor (He et al., 2010a; He et al., 2010b; Dara et al., 2013).",
        "Since the outputs of SMT and TM are not merged but only re-ranked, the possible improvement resulted from those approaches is quite limited.",
        "The second category incorporates TM matched parts into the SMT input sentence in a pipelined manner (Koehn and Senellart, 2010; Zhechev and van Genabith, 2010; He et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2011).",
        "These approaches usually translate the sentence in two stages: (1) first determine whether the 405 extracted TM sentence pair should be adopted or not, and then merge the relevant translations of matched parts into the input sentence; (2) then force the SMT system to only translate those unmatched parts at decoding.",
        "There are three drawbacks for this kind of pipeline approaches (Wang et al., 2013).",
        "Firstly, whether those matched parts should be adopted or not is determined at the sentence level.",
        "Secondly, they select only one TM target phrase before decoding.",
        "Thirdly, they do not utilize the SMT probabilistic information for the matched parts.",
        "The third category mainly adds the longest matched TM phrase pairs into the SMT phrase table (Bi?ici and Dymetman, 2008; Simard and Isabelle, 2009), and associates them with a fixed large probability value to favor the TM target phrase.",
        "However, they only add one aligned target phrase for each matched source phrase and did not distinguish the original and the newly-added phrase-pairs.",
        "The last category incorporates the associated TM information of each source phrase into the SMT during decoding (Wang et al., 2013).",
        "This category can avoid the drawbacks of the pipeline approach-es, and thus achieves superior results when the TM database and the SMT training set are the same.",
        "However, they only refer to the TM information and do not regard the TM phrase-pairs as candidates during decoding.",
        "Therefore, the superiority of this approach disappears when the TM database and the SMT training set are different, because many TM phrase-pairs cannot be found in the original SMT phrase table in this case.",
        "Our approach combines the strength of both the third and the last categories.",
        "During decoding, the associated TM information is referred to re-score the SMT candidates.",
        "At the same time, all matched TM phrase-pairs are dynamically merged into the phrase table.",
        "Moreover, this is the first unified framework for integrating TM into SMT at decoding when the TM database and the SMT training set are different.",
        "Although some previous works of the second and third categories can be also applied when the TM database and the SMT training set are different, they did not explicitly focus on and test this case.",
        "Last, since the example-based machine translation (EBMT, [Nagao, 1984]) is similar to that of using TM, some approaches (Watanabe and Sumita, 2003; Smith and Clark, 2009; Dandapat et al., 2011; 2012; Phillips, 2011) also combined EBMT with SMT.",
        "It would be interesting to compare our approaches with theirs in the future.",
        "6 Conclusion Combining TM and SMT can greatly improve the translation performance and reduce human post-editing effort.",
        "In comparison with those previous approaches, our work makes the following contribu-tions: (1) Dynamically merge the matched TM phrase-pairs into the SMT phrase table to meet the real ap-plication; (2) Propose an improved integrated model to distinguish the original SMT phrase-pairs from the newly-added ones extracted from TM; (3) Adopt a simple but effective TM adaptation method to favor the consistent translation in cross-domain test.",
        "This is the first work adopting a unified framework to integrate the TM information into the SMT model during decoding when the TM database and the SMT training set are different.",
        "On the TM database which consists of Chinese?English computer technical documents, our experiments have shown that merging the TM phrase-pairs achieves significant improvements when the fuzzy match score is above 0.5.",
        "Furthermore, the proposed approaches are significantly better than either the SMT or the TM systems for both the in-domain and the cross-domain tests.",
