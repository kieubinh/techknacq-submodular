        "Machine Translation (MT) Quality Estimation (QE) aims to automatically predict the quality of MT output without using reference translations (Blatz et al., 2003; Specia et al., 2009).",
        "QE systems usually employ supervised machine learning models that use different information extracted from (source, target) sentence pairs as features along with quality scores as labels.",
        "The notion of quality that these models measure can be indicated by different scores.",
        "Some examples are the average number of edits required to post-edit the MT output, i.e., human translation edit rate 1 (HTER (Snover et al., 2006)), and the time (in seconds) required to post-edit a translation produced by an MT system (Specia, 2011).",
        "Research on QE has received a strong boost in recent years due to the increase in the usage of MT systems in real-world applications.",
        "Automatic and reference-free MT quality prediction demonstrated to be useful for different applications, such as: deciding whether the translation output can be published without post-editing (Soricut and Echihabi, 2010), filtering out low-quality translation suggestions that should be rewritten from scratch (Specia et al., 2009), selecting the best translation output from a pool of MT systems (Specia et al., 2010), and informing readers of the translation whether it is reliable or not (Turchi et al., 2012).",
        "Another example is the computer-assisted translation (CAT) scenario, in which it might be necessary to predict the quality of translation suggestions generated by different MT systems to support the activity of post editors working with different genres of text.",
        "The dominant QE framework presents some characteristics that can limit models?",
        "applicability in such real-world scenarios.",
        "First, the scores used as training labels (HTER, time) are costly to obtain because they are derived from manual post-editions of MT output.",
        "Such requirement makes it difficult to develop models for domains in which there is a limited amount of labeled data.",
        "Second, the learning methods currently used (for instance in the framework of QE shared evaluation campaigns) 2 assume that training and test data are sampled from the same distribution.",
        "Though reasonable as a first evaluation setting to promote research in the field, this controlled scenario is not realistic as different data in real-world applications might be post-edited by different translators, the translations might be generated by different MT systems and the documents being translated might belong to different domains or genres.",
        "To This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "1 Edit distance is calculated as the number of edits (word insertions, deletions, substitutions, and shifts) divided by the number of words in the reference.",
        "Lower HTER values indicate better translations.",
        "2 In the last two editions of the yearly Workshop on Machine Translation, several QE shared tasks have been proposed (Callison-Burch et al., 2012; Bojar et al., 2013).",
        "409 overcome these limitations a plausible research objective is to exploit techniques that: (i) allow domains and distributions of features to be different between training and test data, and (ii) that cope with the scarce amount of training labels by sharing information across domains, a common scenario for transfer learning.",
        "In this paper we investigate the use of techniques that can exploit the training instances from different domains to learn a QE model for a specific target domain for which there is a small amount of labeled data.",
        "In particular, we are interested in approaches that allow not only learning from one single source domain but also from multiple source domains simultaneously, by leveraging the labels from all available data to improve results in a target domain.",
        "Given these requirements, we experiment with different multitask learning techniques that perform transfer learning via a common task structure (domain relatedness).",
        "Furthermore, we employ an approach based on feature augmentation that has been successfully used in other natural language processing tasks.",
        "We present a series of experiments over three domains with increasing amounts of training data, showing that our adaptive approaches outperform competitive baselines.",
        "The contributions of our work are: (i) a first exploration of techniques that overcome the limitation of current QE learning methods when dealing with data with different training and test distributions and domains, and (ii) an empirical verification of the amount of training data required by such techniques to outperform competitive baselines on different target domains.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work addressing the challenges posed by domain adaptation in MT QE.",
        "2 Related Work Quality estimation has recently gained increasing attention, also boosted by two evaluation campaigns organized within the Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT) (Callison-Burch et al., 2012; Bojar et al., 2013).",
        "The bulk of work done so far has focused on the controlled WMT evaluation framework and, in particular, on two major aspects of the problem: feature engineering and machine learning methods.",
        "Feature engineering accounts for linguistically-based predictors that aim to model different perspectives of the quality estimation problem.",
        "The research ranges from identifying indicators that approximate the complexity of translating the source sentence and designing features that model the fluency of the automatically generated translation, to linguistically motivated measures that estimate how adequate the translation is in comparison to the source sentence in terms of meaning (Blatz et al., 2003; Mehdad et al., 2012; Hardmeier et al., 2012; Rubino et al., 2012; Specia et al., 2012; de Souza et al., 2013a).",
        "State-of-the-art QE explores different supervised linear or non-linear learning methods for regression or classification such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), different types of Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Elastic-Net, Gaussian Processes, Naive Bayes, among others (Specia et al., 2009; Buck, 2012; Beck et al., 2013; Souza et al., 2014).",
        "Another aspect related to the learning methods that has received attention is the optimal selection of features in order to overcome issues related with the high-dimensionality of the feature space (Soricut et al., 2012; de Souza et al., 2013a; Beck et al., 2013; de Souza et al., 2013b).",
        "Despite constant improvements, such learning methods have limitations.",
        "The main one is that they assume that both training and test data are independently and identically distributed.",
        "As a consequence, when they are applied to data from a different distribution or domain they show poor performance.",
        "This limitation harms the performance of QE systems for several real-world applications, such as CAT environments.",
        "Advanced CAT systems currently integrate suggestions obtained from MT engines with those derived from translation memories (TMs).",
        "In such framework, the compelling need to speed up the translation process and reduce its costs by presenting human translators with good-quality suggestions raises interesting research challenges for the QE community.",
        "In such environments, translation jobs come from different domains that might be translated by different MT systems and are routed to professional translators with different idiolect, background and quality standards (Turchi et al., 2013).",
        "Such variability calls for flexible and adaptive QE solutions by investigating two directions: (i) modeling translator behaviour (Turchi et al., 2014) and (ii) maximize the learning capabilities from all the available data.",
        "The second research objective motivates our investigation on methods that allow the training and test domains and 410 the distributions to be different.",
        "Recent work in QE focused on aspects that are problematic even in the controlled WMT scenario, and are closely related to the flexibility/adaptability issue.",
        "Focusing on the first of the two aforementioned directions (i.e. modeling translators?",
        "behaviour), Cohn and Specia (2013) propose a Multitask Gaussian Process method that jointly learns a series of annotator-specific models and that outperforms models trained for each annotator.",
        "Our work differs from theirs in that we are interested in the latter research direction (i.e. coping with domain and distribution diversity) and we use in and out-of-domain data to learn robust in-domain models.",
        "Our scenario represents a more challenging setting than the one tackled in (Cohn and Specia, 2013), which does not consider different domains.",
        "In transfer learning there are many techniques suitable to fulfill our requirements.",
        "The aim of transfer learning is to extract the knowledge from one or more source tasks and apply it to a target task (Pan and Yang, 2010).",
        "One type of transfer learning is multitask learning (MTL), which uses domain-specific training signals of related tasks to improve model generalization (Caruana, 1997).",
        "Although it was not originally thought for transferring knowledge to a new task, MTL can be used to achieve this objective due to its capability to capture task relatedness, which is important knowledge that can be applied to a new task (Jiang, 2009).",
        "Domain adaptation is a kind of transfer learning in which source and target domains (i.e. training and test) are different but the tasks are the same (Pan and Yang, 2010).",
        "The domain adaptation techniques that inspire our work have been successfully applied to a variety of NLP tasks (Blitzer et al., 2006; Jiang and Zhai, 2007).",
        "For instance, an effective solution for supervised domain adaptation, EasyAdapt (SVR FEDA henceforth), was proposed in (Daum?e III, 2007) and applied to named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging and shallow parsing.",
        "The approach transforms the domain adaptation problem into a standard learning problem by augmenting the source and target feature set.",
        "The feature space is transformed to be a cross-product of the features of the source and target domains augmented with the original target domain features.",
        "In supervised domain adaptation one has access to out-of-domain labels and wants to leverage a small amount of available in-domain labeled data to train a model (Daum?e III, 2007), the case of this study.",
        "This is different from the semi-supervised case in which in-domain labels are not available.",
        "3 Adaptation for QE An important assumption in MTL is that different tasks (domains in our case) are correlated via a certain structure.",
        "Examples of such structures are the hidden layers in a neural network (Caruana, 1997) and shared feature representation (Argyriou et al., 2007) among others.",
        "This common structure allows for knowledge transfer among tasks and has been demonstrated to improve model generalization over single task learning (STL) for different problems in different areas.",
        "Under this scenario, several assumptions can be made about the relatedness among the tasks, leading to different transfer structures.",
        "We explore three approaches to MTL that deal with task relatedness in different ways.",
        "These are the ?Dirty?",
        "approach to MTL (Jalali et al., 2010), Sparse Trace MTL (Chen et al., 2012) and Robust MTL (Chen et al., 2011).",
        "The three approaches use different regularization techniques that capture task relatedness using norms over the weights of the features.",
        "Before describing the three approaches, we introduce some basic notation similar to (Chen et al., 2011).",
        "In MTL there are T tasks and each task t ?",
        "T has m training samples {(x (t) 1 , y (t) 1 ), .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", (x (t) m , y (t) m )}, with x (t) i ?",
        "R d where d is the number of features and y (t) i ?",
        "R is the output (the response variable or label).",
        "The input features and labels are stacked together to form two different matrices X (t) = [x (t) 1 , .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", x (t) m ] and Y (t) = [x (t) 1 , .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", x (t) m ], respectively.",
        "The weights of the features for each task are represented by W , where each column corresponds to a task and each row corresponds to a feature.",
        "The ?Dirty?",
        "approach to MTL follows the idea that different tasks may share the same discriminative features (Argyriou et al., 2007).",
        "However, it also considers that different tasks might have different discriminative features that are inherent to each task.",
        "Therefore, the method encourages shared-sparsity among tasks and among features in each task.",
        "It decomposes W into two components, one is a row-411 sparsed matrix that corresponds to the features shared among the tasks and the other is an element-wise sparse matrix that corresponds to the non-shared features that are important for each task independently.",
        "More formally, the ?Dirty?",
        "approach is explained by Equation 1. min W T ?",
        "t=1 ||(W (t) X (t) ?",
        "Y (t) )|| 2 2 + ?",
        "s ||S|| 1 + ?",
        "b ||B|| 1,?",
        "subject to: W = S +B (1) where ||(W (t) X (t) ?",
        "Y (t) )|| 2 2 is the least squares loss function, S is the regularization term that encourages element-wise sparsity and B is the block-structured row-sparsity regularizer.",
        "The ||.|| 2 is the l 2 -norm (Euclidean distance), ||.|| 1 is the l 1 -norm (given by ?",
        "i=1 |x i |) and ||.|| 1,?",
        "is the row grouped l 1 norm.",
        "The ?",
        "s and ?",
        "b are non-negative trade-off parameters that control the amount of regularization applied to S and B, respectively.",
        "Sparse Trace MTL considers the problem of learning incoherent sparse and low-rank patterns from multiple related tasks.",
        "This approach captures task relationship via a shared low-rank structure of the weight matrix W .",
        "As computing the low-rank structure of a matrix leads to a NP-hard optimization problem, Chen et al. (2012) proposed to compute the trace norm as a surrogate, making the optimization problem tractable.",
        "In addition to learning the low-rank patterns, this method also considers the fact that different tasks may have different inherent discriminative features.",
        "It decomposes W into two compo-nents: S, which models element-wise sparsity, and Q, which captures task relationship via the trace norm.",
        "The convex problem minimized by Sparse Trace is given in Equation 2. min W T ?",
        "t=1 ||(W (t) X (t) ?",

        "i (W ).",
        "Here, ?",
        "p controls the rank of Q and ?",
        "s controls the sparsity of S. The key assumption in MTL is that tasks are related in some way.",
        "However, this assumption might not hold for a series of real-world problems.",
        "In situations in which tasks are not related a negative transfer of information among tasks might occur, harming the generalization of the model.",
        "One way to deal with this problem is to: (i) group related tasks in one structure and share knowledge among them, and (ii) identify irrelevant tasks maintaining them in a different group that does not share information with the first group.",
        "This is the idea of Robust MTL (RMTL henceforth).",
        "The algorithm approximates task relatedness via a low-rank structure like Sparse Trace and identifies outlier tasks using a group-sparse structure (column-sparse, at task level).",
        "Robust MTL is described by Equation 3.",
        "It employs a non-negative linear combination of the trace norm (the task relatedness component L) and a column-sparse structure induced by the l 1,2 -norm (the outlier task detection component S).",
        "If a task is an outlier it will have non-zero entries in S. min W T ?",

        "s ||S|| 1,2 subject to: W = L+ S (3) where ||S|| 1,2 is the group regularizer that induces sparsity on the tasks.",
        "4 Experimental Setting In this section we describe the data used for our experiments, the features extracted, the set up of the learning methods, the baselines used for comparison and the evaluation of the models.",
        "The goal of our experiments is to show that the methods presented in Section 3 outperform competitive baselines and standard QE learning methods that are not capable of adapting to different domains.",
        "We experiment with three different domains of comparable size and evaluate the performance of the adaptive methods and the standard techniques with different amounts of training data.",
        "The MTL models described in section 3 are trained with the Malsar toolkit implementation (Zhou et al., 2012).",
        "The hyper-parameters are optimized 412 using 5-fold cross-validation in a grid search procedure.",
        "The parameter values are searched in an interval ranging from 10 ?3 to 10 3 .",
        "4.1 Data Our experiments focus on the English-French language pair and encompass three very different domains: newswire text (henceforth News), transcriptions of Technology Entertainment Design talks (TED) and Information Technology manuals (IT).",
        "Such domains are a challenging combination for adaptive systems since they come from very different sources spanning speech and written discourse (TED and News/IT, respectively) as well as a very well defined and controlled vocabulary in the case of IT.",
        "Each domain is composed of 363 tuples formed by the source sentence in English, the French translation produced by an MT system and a human post-edition of the translated sentence.",
        "For each pair (translation, post-edition) we use as labels the HTER score computed with TERCpp 3 .",
        "For the three domains we use half of the data for training (181 instances) and half of the data for testing (182 instances).",
        "The limited amount of instances for training contrasts with the 800 or more instances of the WMT evaluation campaigns and is closer to real-world applications where the availability of large and representative training sets is far from being guaranteed (e.g. the CAT scenario).",
        "The sentence tuples for the first two domains are randomly sampled from the Trace corpus 4 .",
        "The translations were generated by two different MT systems, a state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical MT system and a commercial rule-based system.",
        "Furthermore, the translations were post-edited by up to four different translators, as described in (Wisniewski et al., 2013).",

        "The complete dataset has been used for MT and automatic speech recognition systems evaluation within the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT).",
        "The News domain is formed by newswire text used in WMT translation campaigns and covers different topics.",
        "The IT texts come from a software user manual translated by a statistical MT system based on the state-of-the-art phrase-based Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007) trained on about 2M parallel sentences.",
        "The post-editions were collected from one professional translator operating on the Matecat 5 CAT tool in real working conditions.",
        "Table 1 provides macro-indicators (number of tokens, vocabulary size, average sentence length) that evidence the large difference between the domains addressed by our experiments and give an idea of the difficulty of the task.",
        "A peculiarity of the TED domain is that it is formed by manual transcriptions of speech translated by different MT systems, configuring a different type of discourse than News and IT.",
        "In TED, the vocabulary size in the source and target sentences is lower than that of the News domain but higher than IT.",
        "News presents the most varied vocabulary, which is an evidence of the more varied lexical choice represented by the several topics that compose the domain.",
        "Moreover, News has the highest average sentence length, a characteristic of non-technical written discourse, which tends to have longer sentences than spoken discourse and domains dominated by technical jargon.",
        "Such a characteristic is exactly what differentiates IT from the other two domains.",
        "IT sentences are technical and present a reduced average number of 3 http://sourceforge.net/projects/tercpp/ 4 http://anrtrace.limsi.fr/trace_postedit.tar.bz2 5 www.matecat.com 413 words, as evidenced by the vocabulary size (the smallest among the three domains).",
        "These numbers suggest a divergence between IT and the other two domains, possibly making adaptation more difficult.",
        "4.2 Features For all the experiments we use the same feature set composed of seventeen features proposed in (Specia et al., 2009).",
        "The set is formed by features that model the complexity of translating the source sentence (e.g. the average source token length or the number of tokens in the source sentence), and the fluency of the translated sentence produced by the MT system (e.g. the language model probability of the translation).",
        "The decision to use this feature set is motivated by the fact that it demonstrated to be robust across language pairs, MT systems and text domains (Specia et al., 2009).",
        "The 17 features are: ?",
        "number of tokens in the source sentence and in the generated translation; ?",
        "average source token length; ?",
        "average number of occurences of the target word within the generated translation; ?",
        "language model probability of the source sentence and generated translation; ?",

        "average number of translations per source word in the sentence: as given by IBM 1 model thresh-olded so that P (t|s) > 0.01 weighted by the inverse frequency of each word in the source side of the SMT training corpus; ?",

        "in the first quartile of frequency (lower frequency words) in a corpus of the source language; ?",
        "percentage of unigrams?, bigrams and trigrams in the fourth quartile of frequency (higher frequency words) in a corpus of the source language; ?",
        "percentage of unigrams in the source sentence seen in the source side of the SMT training corpus; ?",
        "number of punctuation marks in the source sentence and in the hypothesis translation; 4.3 Baselines As a term of comparison, we consider these baselines in our experiments.",
        "A simple to implement but difficult to beat baseline when dealing with regression on tasks with different distributions is to compute the mean of the training labels and use it as the prediction for each testing point (Rubino et al., 2013).",
        "Hereafter we refer to this baseline as ?.",
        "Since supervised domain adaptation techniques should outperform models that are trained only on the available in-domain data, we also use as baseline the regressor built only on the available in-domain data (SVR in-domain).",
        "Furthermore, as a third baseline, we train a regressor by pooling together training data of all domains, combining source and target data without any kind of task relationship mechanism (SVR Pooling).",
        "The baselines are trained on the feature set described earlier in Section 4.2 with an SVM regression (SVR) method using the implementation of Scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011).",
        "The radial basis function (RBF) kernel is used for all baselines.",
        "The hyper-parameters of the model are optimized using randomized search optimization process with 50 iterations as described in (Bergstra and Bengio, 2012) and used previously for QE in (de Souza et al., 2013a).",
        "The best parameters are found using 5-fold cross-validation on the training data and \u000f, ?",
        "and C are sampled from exponential distributions scaled at 0.1 for the first two parameters and scaled at 100 for the last one.",
        "It is important to notice that the SVR with RBF kernel methods learn non-linear models that have been shown to perform better than linear models on the set of features used for predicting HTER.",
        "On the contrary, the MTL methods presented in Section 3 are methods that do not explore kernels or any other kind of non-linear learning method.",

        "First, we evaluate the performance of single task learning methods on different cross-domain experiments.",
        "Then, we report the evaluation for the multitask learning methods and discuss the results.",
        "5.1 Single Task Learning With the objective of having an insight about the difference between the domains, we train the SVR in-domain baseline with all available training data for each domain and evaluate its performance on the same domain and in the two remaining domains.",
        "Results are reported in Table 2, where the diagonal shows the figures for the in-domain evaluation.",
        "These numbers suggest that the IT domain configures a more difficult challenge for the learning algorithm.",
        "The IT in-domain model (IT src -IT tgt ) presents a performance 21% inferior to News and 8% inferior to TED.",
        "For all models trained on a source domain different than the target domain there is a drop in performance, as it is expected from a system that assumes that training and test data are sampled from the same distribution.",
        "In addition, when predicting IT using the model trained on News, we have a perfomance drop of 13% whereas using the model trained on TED the performance drops up to 4%.",
        "5.2 Multitask learning We run the baselines described in Section 4.3 and the methods described in Section 3 on different amounts of training data, ranging from 18 to 181 instances (10% and 100%, respectively).",
        "The motivation is to verify how much training data is required by the MTL methods to outperform the baselines for a target domain.",
        "Table 3 presents the results for the three domains with models trained on 30, 50 and 415 100% of the training data (54, 90 and 181 instances, respectively).",

        "6 Conclusion In this work we presented an investigation of methods that overcome limitations presented by current MT QE state-of-the-art systems when applied to real world conditions.",
        "In such scenarios (e.g. CAT environment) the requirements are two-fold: (i) learning in the presence of different train/test feature and label distributions and across different domains/genres, and (ii) the capability of learning with scarce training data.",
        "In our experiments, we explored transfer learning methods, in particular multitask learning, and we showed that such methods can cope with the needs of real-world scenarios.",
        "We showed that multitask learning methods are capable to learn robust models for three different domains that perform better than three strong baselines trained on the same amount of data.",
        "The methods explored here benefit from increasing amounts of training data but also perform well when operating with very limited amounts of data.",
        "We believe that the results obtained in this first exploration of model adaptation for the problem can encourage the MT QE community to shift the focus from controlled scenarios to more applicable, real-world contexts that require more robust methods.",
