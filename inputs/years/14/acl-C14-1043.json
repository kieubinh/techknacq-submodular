        "In this study we compare two machine translation devices on twelve machine translation medical-domain specific tasks, and two transliteration tasks, altogether involving twelve language pairs, including English-Chinese and English-Russian, which do not share the same scripts.",

        "On most translation tasks, the analogical device outperforms the phrase-based one, and several combinations of both systems significantly outperform each system individually.",

        "A proportional analogy is a relation between 4 objets, x , y , z and t , noted [x : y :: z : t], which reads x is to y as z is to t .",
        "A formal proportional analogy, hereafter analogy, is a proportional analogy which involves a relationship at the graphemic level, such as [atomkraftwerken : atomkriegen :: kraftwerks : kriegs] in German.",
        "Analogical learning is a holistic learning paradigm (sketched in Section 2) which relies on proportional analogies for generalizing a training set.",
        "Lepage and Denoual (2005b) pioneered the application of analogical learning to Machine Translation (MT).",
        "Different variants of their system have been tested within the IWSLT evaluation campaigns (Lepage and Denoual, 2005a; Lepage and Lardilleux, 2008; Lepage et al., 2008; Lepage et al., 2009).",
        "Since then, a number of studies have been investigating analogical learning for performing more specific machine translation tasks.",
        "Langlais et al. (2009) applied it to translating medical terms, and Langlais and Patry (2007) investigated the more specific task of translating unknown words, a problem simultaneously investigated in (Denoual, 2007).",
        "Recently, Langlais (2013) applied formal analogies to transliterate English proper names into Chinese.",
        "Those works suggest, at least on the tasks investigated, that analogical translation typically shows better precision than phrase-based Statistical MT (SMT), but at a much lower recall.",
        "Still, the analogical devices tested in these works vary from task to task, making it difficult to draw a clear picture of the strengths and weaknesses of analogy-based translation.",
        "In this study, we perform a systematic comparison of an analogical and a phrase-based MT engine for the translation of fourteen different testbeds.",
        "We also improve the state-of-the-art of analogical learning by revisiting the aggregation step of the process.",
        "In particular, we observe that ranking analogical candidates according to random forests improves the performance of the analogical device, over training a classifier, as proposed for instance in (Langlais, 2013).",
        "On each task we tackle, we report improvements to the state-of-the-art in analogical learning.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, we describe the principle of analogical learning and sketch our analogical device in Section 2.",
        "We describe our experimental protocol in Section 3.",
        "We analyze the performance of several variants of our analogical device in Section 4 and compare it to a state-of-the-art phrase-base SMT engine.",

        "Given an input form u unseen at training time, analogical learning generates its associated output form (in our case its translation), by accomplishing 3 steps.",
        "First, analogies in the input space [x : y :: z : u] are searched for.",

        "This is the purpose of the third step, or selector.",
        "Note that for the mapping to happen between input and output strings, there is no attempt to align subsequences of forms in both spaces, as it is typically done in statistical MT.",
        "There is actually no alignment whatsoever: analogies are treated in each space separately, and the mapping is the result of the inductive bias which promotes that an analogy in the input space corresponds to an analogy in the output space.",

        "In practice, and for the tasks we consider in this work, our implementation allows the translation of an input form within a few seconds on average.",

        "This may happen because no input analogy is identified, or because none yields an output equation with solutions.",
        "In contrast, there are many forms for which several candidate translations will be provided, thus the need for a good aggregator (see next section).",
        "This happens because an equation typically allows many solutions, and because many input analogies might be identified for solving a given input form.",

        "Medical term translation We use the datasets described in (Langlais et al., 2009).",
        "Part of the data comes from the Medical Subject Headings (MESH) thesaurus.",
        "This thesaurus is used by the US National Library of Medicine to index the biomedical scientific literature in the MEDLINE database.",
        "The MESH material concerns five language pairs with three relatively close European languages (English-French, English-Spanish and English-Swedish), a more distant one (English-Finnish) and one pair involving different scripts (English-Russian).",
        "The material was split in three randomly selected parts (TRAIN, DEV and TEST), so that the development and test material contain exactly 1000 terms each.",
        "Roughly a third of the examples are pairs of single-word terms.",
        "For the Spanish-English language pair, a set of medical terms from the Medical Drug Regulatory Activities thesaurus (MEDDRA) is also available.",
        "This dataset contains roughly three times more terms than the Spanish-English material from the MESH dataset.",
        "Forms in the dataset are typically longer and the percentage of examples that are pairs of single-word terms is only 5.6%.",
        "This set is used for studying how the silence rate of analogical learning evolves with the size of the training set.",
        "We are pleased to share those datasets.",

        "1 In particular, spaces in forms were considered as any ordinary symbol.",
        "Measuring how close a candidate translation is to a reference is of little interest here, since typically, a medical term only has one reference translation that we seek to discover.",
        "Therefore, rewarding partially correct translations (like a metric such as BLEU (Pa- pineni et al., 2002) does) is not especially useful.",
        "Therefore we report the accuracy of the first candidate proposed by a translation device for each source term.",
        "Accuracy is measured as the percentage of test forms for which the first candidate is the sanctioned one.",
        "So in the example of Figure 1, the aggregator illustrated in the bottom frame would get one point since the first translation produced is the sanctioned one, while an aggregator that would pick the most frequently generated candidate would receive no point.",
        "Accuracy is the main metric of the NEWS evaluation campaign, and we used the NEWS 2009 official evaluation script 2 in order to compute it.",
        "Also of interest for the analogical devices, is the silence rate, computed as the percentage of input forms for which no output is generated.",

        "Indeed, when translating a test form, a large number of input analogies can be considered (hundreds) and therefore a large number of output equations, each generating potentially numerous solutions (recall the translation session in Figure 1).",
        "They reported for instance that on the English-to-Finnish translation direction, they had over 2.7 million instances to classify among which slightly less than 4200 were positive ones.",
        "Not only is this task very unbalanced, it is also challenging to train a classifier on that many instances.",
        "In this work, we reframe the classification task as one of identifying the correct candidate among the 100 most frequently generated ones.",
        "An instance in this setting is simply a candidate form, and not a pair of analogies as in (Langlais et al., 2009).",
        "This is still an unbalanced task, since typically at most one candidate will be correct, but the ratio 1:100 is more manageable, and the classification task is easier to deploy.",
        "A total of 81 features are computed for each candidate form: ANA is a set of 59 features (mostly analogical ones, therefore the name).",
        "Some features are characterizing the candidate solution thanks to a character-based language model (the same 5-gram language model used by Moses).",
        "Others are characterizing the process with which a given candidate is gener-ated, such as the number of input analogies involved, the number of target equations that generated the candidate, the average degree of the analogies involved, etc.",
        "The remaining features are cohort-based ones, such as the rank of the candidate according to frequency, to the language model, etc.",
        "3 This was done by separating each character in the training material by a space; true spaces being previously substituted by a special character not belonging to the alphabet.",
        "4 A Markov model of order 4.",
        "We tried higher order models, without gains.",
        "449 IBM is a set of 18 features that are capitalizing on statistical word alignment.",
        "The alignment models being used are word-based generative models that are exploited by Moses in order to build the phrase table, namely IBM models, therefore the name of the feature set.",
        "Different likelihood-based features were computed, as well as rank features (the rank of the likelihood of the candidate in the cohort of candidates, the ratio of its likelihood over the highest likelihood in the cohort, etc.).",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to capitalize on such features in the analogical sphere.",
        "MOS is a set of 4 features that are exploiting the n-best solutions we asked Moses to produce.",
        "The idea being that if Moses ranks a given analogical candidate well (in rank or in score), this is a good indicator of the salience of this candidate.",
        "The two main features are the rank of the candidate in the n-best list and its score as given by Moses (or 0 if Moses does not produce the candidate).",
        "We point out that an analogical device with an aggregator that uses the features ANA and IBM is basically making use of the same models (language and IBM) as those used by Moses.",
        "It is therefore interesting to compare this configuration to Moses.",
        "Also, the aggregators that are making use of the MOS features are performing a kind of combination that has not been explored so far.",
        "Note also that we did not engineer task-specific features.",
        "For instance, for the medical term translation task, terms and their translation often share the same latin root, which could be exploited to boost performance.",
        "We investigated two families of classifiers: voted-perceptrons (Freund and Schapire, 1999) and support vector machines (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995).",
        "We investigated all the metaparameters that LibSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011) offers (penalization, kernels, etc.",
        "), but did not manage to outperform the performance of the former classifier (an in-house implementation) that we trained with 500 epochs.",
        "Therefore we only report the results of the voted-perceptron classifier (VP).",
        "Classifying each candidate solution separately is not optimal.",
        "This is why we also investigated reranking algorithms in this study.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first time reranking is applied in analogical learning.",
        "We tested the algorithms implemented in RankLib 5 and SVMRank 6 toolkits, and found random forests (Breiman, 2001) to be the most beneficial.",
        "We note it RF in the sequel.",
        "We only considered bipartite ranking in this work (Argarwal, 2005).",
        "4 Results 4.1 MESH The accuracy of the translation devices we trained are summarized in Table 2 for the 10 translation directions we tested.",
        "This table calls for several comments.",
        "First, it is noticeable that our implementation of analogical learning with the FREQ aggregator (line LYZ) outperforms the equivalent configuration in (Langlais et al., 2009) by roughly 10 absolute points in accuracy.",
        "We also observe a slight reduction of the silence rate, which still remains high, since on average 54.6% of the test forms do not receive any candidate solution.",
        "Second, we observe that Moses slightly outperforms the FREQ variant at a silence rate of 0 (a decision is always returned by Moses).",
        "This suggests that FREQ is actually more precise than Moses and calls for a simple combination where the analogical device is trusted whenever it produces a candidate solution, and Moses otherwise.",
        "This is illustrated in line CASC(FREQ,MOSES).",
        "We observe a clear improvement over each system: almost 10 absolute accuracy points on average are gained by this combination (38.6%).",
        "Third, we observe that the aggregators that are relying on a classifier or a reranker offer better performance than picking the most frequently generated form (as done by FREQ).",
        "The gains are not especially high, but are consistent over all translation directions.",
        "Overall, it seems that the random forest reranker we investigated (the best reranker we tried) offers the best performance on average.",
        "This represents 92% of the reachable accuracy according to line ORACLE which involves a perfect classifier.",
        "This validates the usefulness of the features we designed.",
        "As far as features are concerned, it seems that using all of them leads to better performance overall, and that the configurations that are making use of the ANA and IBM feature sets are comparable or higher than Moses.",
        "Cascading the best analogical device with Moses (last line) finally gives a slight boost in accuracy.",
        "In the end, the best system we tested correctly translated 41.9% of the test terms in the first position on average across translation directions.",
