        "We present a diverse retrieval technique for ranking documents that are spontaneously retrieved and recommended to people during a conversation.",
        "These documents represent potentially useful information for the conversation participants.",
        "The information needs of the participants are represented by implicit queries which are built in the background based on their current speech, specifically from keywords obtained from the conversation transcripts.",
        "Since people usually mention several topics even during a short conversation span, such keyword sets are made of content words related to different topics.",
        "When juxtaposed in an implicit query, these topics may have noisy effects on the retrieval results (Bhogal et al., 2007; Carpineto and Romano, 2012).",
        "The purpose of this paper is to present a method for merging lists of documents retrieved through multiple implicit queries prepared for short conversations spans.",
        "Several topically-separated queries are constructed from keywords, and generate several lists of documents.",
        "The goal of the method proposed here is to generate a unique and concise list of documents that can be recommended in real time to the conversation participants.",
        "The list should cover the maximum number of implicit queries and therefore topics.",
        "To merge the lists of documents according to these criteria, we use inspiration from extractive text summarization (Lin and Bilmes, 2011; Li et al., 2012) and from our own previous work on diverse keyword extraction (Habibi and Popescu-Belis, 2013).",
        "The method proposed here rewards at the same time topic similarity ?",
        "to select the most relevant documents to the conversation fragment ?",
        "and topic diversity ?",
        "to cover the maximum number of implicit queries and therefore topics in a concise and relevant list of recommendations, if more than one topic is discussed in the conversation fragment.",
        "Several studies have been previously carried out on merging lists of results in information retrieval.",
        "Despite the superficial similarity, the problem here is in fact different from distributed information re-trieval, where several lists of results from different search engines for the same query must be merged.",
        "Moreover, many studies addressed the topic diversification approach for re-ranking the retrieved results of a single query.",
        "However, these approaches are not directly applicable to multiple queries.",
        "588 The paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we review existing techniques for merging and re-ranking lists of search results which are applicable here.",
        "We then explain the general framework of our document recommender system in Section 3.",
        "In Section 4 we describe the proposed algorithm for diverse merging of lists of recommendations.",
        "Section 5 presents the data, the parameters setting, and evaluation tasks for comparing document lists.",
        "In Section 6 we first demonstrate empirically the benefits, for just-in-time document recommendation, of separating users?",
        "information needs into multiple topically-separated queries rather than using a unique query.",
        "Then, we compare the proposed diverse merging technique with several alternative ones, showing that it outperforms them according to human judgments of relevance, and also exemplify the results on one conversation fragment given in the Appendix A.",
        "2 Related Work Just-in-time document retrieval systems have been designed to recommend to their users documents which are potentially relevant to their activities, e.g. individual users authoring documents or browsing various repositories, or small groups holding business or private meetings (Hart and Graham, 1997; Rhodes and Maes, 2000; Popescu-Belis et al., 2008).",
        "When using a document recommender system, people are generally unwilling to examine a large number of recommended documents, mainly because this would distract them from their main activity.",
        "Several solutions to this problem have been proposed.",
        "For instance, the Watson document recommender system (Budzik and Hammond, 2000), designed for reading or writing activities, clustered the document results and selected from each cluster the best representative to generate a list of recommendations.",
        "Clustering results is not suitable for our application where the mixture of topics in a single query will degrade the document results aimed to be clustered (Bhogal et al., 2007; Carpineto and Romano, 2012), and consequently may have a damaging effect on the clusters?",
        "representatives.",
        "The second part of the method, which selected the best representative of the clusters in the final document list can be helpful; however, its effectiveness relies on having clusters with the same level of importance (Wu and McClean, 2007).",
        "Many studies in information retrieval addressed the problem of diverse ranking, which can be stated as a tradeoff between finding relevant versus diverse information (Robertson, 1997).",
        "The existing diverse ranking proposals differ in their diversifying policies and definitions, which can be categorized into implicit methods (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998; Zhai et al., 2003; Radlinski and Dumais, 2006; Wang and Zhu, 2009) or explicit ones (Agrawal et al., 2009; Carterette and Chandar, 2009; Santos et al., 2010; Vargas et al., 2012).",
        "The implicit approaches assume that similar documents will cover similar aspects of a query, and have to be demoted in the ranking to promote relative novelty and reduce overall redundancy.",
        "In one of the earliest approaches, Carbonell and Goldstein (1998) introduced Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) to re-rank documents based on a tradeoff between the relevance of document results and relative novelty as a measure of diversity.",
        "MMR was also used by Radlinski and Dumais (2006) to re-rank results from a query set which is generated for a user query and represents a variety of potential user intents.",
        "Instead of implicitly accounting for the aspects covered by each document, another option is to explicitly model these aspects within the diversification approach.",
        "Agrawal et al. (2009) introduced a submodular objective function to minimize the probability of average user dissatisfaction by assuming a taxonomy of information and modeling user query aspects at the topical level of this taxonomy.",
        "Al-ternatively, Santos et al. (2010) proposed another submodular objective function to maximize coverage and minimize redundancy with respect to query aspects modeled in a keyword-based representation form instead of a predefined taxonomy.",
        "In our case, the recommender system for conversational environments requires diversity in the results of multiple topically-separated queries, rather than of a single ambiguous query.",
        "Therefore, a new approach will be proposed, and will be compared in particular to a version of the explicit diversification approach (Santos et al., 2010) adapted to our problem.",
        "3 Framework of our Document Recommender System We have designed the Automatic Content Linking Device (ACLD), a speech-based just-in-time document recommender system for business meetings (Popescu-Belis et al., 2008; Popescu-Belis et al., 2011).",

        "The ACLD monitors the ongoing conversation, and formulates queries based on the words detected by a real-time automatic speech recognition (ASR) system (Garner et al., 2009).",
        "The queries are fired periodically to retrieve documents which are then recommended to users by displaying their titles along with relevant excerpts.",
        "As these queries are built and triggered in the background, they are referred to as ?implicit queries?, as opposed to ?explicit?",
        "ones that could be formulated by users.",
        "Just-in-time document recommendation in the ACLD system proceeds according to the steps shown in Figure 1, which displays at step 4 the various options for merging lists of results that are the focus of this paper.",
        "Prior to the first processing step outlined in Figure 1, the ACLD must decide when to make a recom-mendation, and what portion of the conversation prior to that moment should be used.",
        "This question is beyond the scope of this paper, and remains to be fully investigated, using verbal and non-verbal criteria.",
        "Here, for the reasons explained in Section 5.2, the ACLD recommends documents every two minutes, segmenting the conversation at the end of the nearest utterance and using the entire conversation fragment since the previous recommendation.",
        "Although in practice the results of the current recommendation process are merged with the previous ones (using a weighted mechanism that embodies the idea of ?per- sistence?",
        "of documents over time), in this paper we will consider the recommendation for each fragment independently of the previous one.",
        "The recommendation process represented in Figure 1 starts by extracting a set of keywords, C, from the words recognized by the ASR system from the users?",
        "conversations.",
        "The keywords are extracted using the diverse keyword extraction technique that we proposed (Habibi and Popescu-Belis, 2013), which maximizes the coverage of the topics of a text by the extracted keyword set, as we also target in this paper.",
        "Then, implicit queries which express the users?",
        "information needs are formulated using the keyword set, following two alternative approaches depicted in step 2 of Figure 1.",
        "In a baseline model (right side of the figure), a single query is built for the conversation fragment using the entire keyword list as an implicit query.",
        "In the approach we are advocating, multiple topically-separated queries are produced for the conversation fragment (step 2, left side of the figure).",
        "This is described in a separate document (Habibi and Popescu-Belis, submitted), but can be outlined as follows.",
        "The implicit queries are obtained by clustering the above-mentioned keyword set into several topically-separated subsets, each one corresponding to an abstract topic obtained using topic modeling techniques (similarly to the model 590 presented in Subsection 4.1).",
        "Each subset is an implicit query, and is weighted based on the importance of the topic to which it is associated.",
        "In step 3, we separately submit each implicit query to the Apache Lucene search engine over the English Wikipedia and obtain several lists of relevant articles.",
        "Finally, we merge and re-rank these lists before recommendation (step 4).",
        "One baseline alternative is the explicit diverse ranking technique proposed by Santos et al. (2010) for diversifying the primary search results retrieved for a single query, shown on the right side of the figure.",
        "To compare the methods, we adapted this latter method to make it applicable to our system when a single implicit query is built for a conversation fragment, by defining query aspects using the abstract topics employed for query and document representation.",
        "The method is noted DivS as it diversifies documents from a single list.",
        "Our proposal lies at step 4.",
        "As represented on the left side of Figure 1, in our system, we merge the lists of documents retrieved for multiple implicit queries.",
        "We thus propose a new method noted DivM and we compare it with two other merging techniques.",
        "The first one, noted SimM, ignores the diversity of topics in the list of results and ranks documents only by considering their topic similarity to the conversation fragment.",
        "The second one is the merging technique used by the above-mentioned Watson system (Budzik and Hammond, 2000), which uses Round robin merging, hence it is noted Round-robin.",
        "In contrast, our proposed method, DivM, is a diverse merging technique which we now proceed to define formally.",
        "4 Diverse Merging of the Results of Multiple Queries The diverse merging of retrieved document lists is the process of creating a short, diverse and relevant list of recommended documents which covers the maximum number of topics of each conversation fragment.",
        "The merging algorithm rewards diversity by decreasing the gain of selecting documents from a list as the number of its previously selected documents increases.",
        "The method proceeds in two steps.",
        "First, we represent queries and the corresponding list of candidate documents from the Apache Lucene search engine using topic modeling techniques, and then we rank documents by using topical similarity and rewarding the coverage of different lists.",
        "4.1 Document and Query Representation A topic model represents the abstract topics which occur in a collection of documents ?",
        "here, preferably, a collection that is representative of the domain of the conversations.",
        "Once trained, topic models such as Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) or Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) can be used to determine the distribution of abstract topics in each set of words composing either a conversation fragment, or a query, or a document.",
        "LDA implemented in the Mallet toolkit (McCallum, 2002) is used here to train topic models because it does not suffer from the over-fitting of PLSA (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "We first learn a probability model for observing a word v in a document d through the set of abstract topics T = {t 1 , ..., t z , ..., t Z }, where Z is the number of topics, using the Mallet toolkit: p(v|d) = Z ?",
        "z=1 p(v|t z ) ?",
        "p(t z |d) (1) The topic-word distribution p(v|t z ) and the document-topic distribution p(t z |d), which are obtained using topic modeling, respectively show the contribution of the word v in the construction of the topic t z , and the distribution of topic t z in the document d with respect to the other topics.",
        "We represent each new text or fragment A (e.g. from a conversation or document) by a set of probability distributions over all abstract topics T noted as P (A) = {p(t 1 |A), ..., p(t z |A), ..., p(t Z |A)} where p(t z |A) is inferred using the Gibbs sampling implemented by the Mallet toolkit given the topic models previously learned.",
        "We associate to each new document d i and query q j a set of topic probabilities according to the above definition noted respectively as P (d i ) = {p(t 1 |d i ), ..., p(t z |d i ), ..., p(t Z |d i )} and P (q j ) = {p(t 1 |q j ), ..., p(t z |q j ), ..., p(t Z |q j )}.",
        "4.2 Diverse Merging Problem As stated above, our goal is to recommend a short ranked list of documents answering the users?",
        "information needs hypothesized in a conversation fragment, which are modeled by multiple topic-aware implicit 591 queries as described in Section 3.",
        "We build the final list of recommended documents by merging the document lists, one from each implicit query, with the objective of the maximum coverage of the topics of the conversation fragment.",
        "Since each document list contains documents found by a search engine given an implicit query, which was prepared for one of the main topics of the conversation fragment, we merge the lists by selecting documents from the maximum number of lists in addition to maximizing their topical similarity to the conversation fragment.",
        "The problem of diverse merging of lists thus amounts to finding a ranked subset of documents S ?",
        "?",
        "M i=1 l i , which are the most representative of all the result lists l i , and potentially the most informative with respect to the conversation fragment and the information needs that are implicitly stated.",
        "This problem is an instance of the maximum coverage problem, which is known to be NP-hard.",
        "Our formulation and solution proceed as follows.",
        "Let us consider a set of implicit queries Q = {q 1 , ..., q M }, and the corresponding set of document lists L = {l 1 , ..., l M } resulting from each query.",
        "M is the number of implicit queries of the fragment, and each l i is a list of documents {d 1 , ..., d N i } which are retrieved for query q i .",
        "We define the weight w i of each query q i as the importance within the conversation fragment of the topics represented in the query q i , and compute it as the topical similarity of q i to the fragment, as shown in Equation 2.",
        "In this equation, q is the query made from the whole keyword set, which we call a collective query, and includes keywords for all the main topics of the conversation fragment in one query.",
        "In turn, we associate to q a set of probabilities over abstract topics, P (q) = {p(t 1 |q), ..., p(t Z |q)}, similar to the representation of implicit queries explained in Subsection 4.1. w i = Z ?",
        "z=1 p(t z |q i ) ?",

        "We define a monotone submodular function for diverse merging of document lists inspired by the latter two applications, who proposed a power function with a scaling exponent between 0 and 1 for diverse selection of sentences (or keywords) covering the maximum number of topics of a given document with a fixed number of items.",

        "Each worker could answer the entire set of 26 HITs, or part of it.",
        "We observed that the average time spent per HIT was around 90 seconds.",
        "4 For instance, they could combine an analysis of non-verbal information to detect ?interruptibility?",
        "and of verbal information to detect topic changes and perform online segmentation (Mohri et al., 2010).",
        "Topic changes, however, are not appropriate moments to make recommendations because it would be useless to recommend documents about a topic that the users no longer discuss (Jones and Brown, 2004).",
        "594 To consolidate the comparative judgments over a large number of subjects and conversation fragments, and compute an aggregated score, we applied a qualification control factor to the human judgments (to reduce the effect of judgments which disagree with the majority vote) and another one to the HITs (to reduce the impact of undecided HITs on the global scores).",
        "This was done by using the PCC-H metric, defined and validated in our previous work (Habibi and Popescu-Belis, 2012), which provides two scores, one for each document list, summing up to 100%; a higher value indicates a better list.",
        "In addition to PCC-H, we also provide below (Table 1) the raw preference scores for each comparison, i.e. the number of times a system was preferred over another one, although PCC-H was shown to be a more reliable indicator of quality.",
        "6 Experimental Results We merged and re-ranked the document lists intended to be recommended during a conversation by the four methods presented above in Section 3 and Figure 1.",
        "Three methods merge lists of results from topically-separated queries: SimM only considers their similarity with the fragment; Round-robin picks the best document in each list; and our proposal, DivM, considers the diversity and importance of topics.",
        "A fourth method, DivS, uses one query made of all keywords extracted from the conversation fragment, and ranks the documents using the diverse re-ranking technique proposed by Santos et al. (2010).",
        "Binary comparisons were performed between pairs of techniques, using crowdsourcing over 26 conversation fragments of the ELEA Corpus, and aiming to minimize the number of binary comparisons while still ordering completely the methods according to their perceived quality.",
        "6.1 Diverse Re-ranking vs. Similarity Merging We first performed a comparison between the top five documents generated by two recommendation strategies, DivS and SimM, over 26 conversation fragments of the ELEA Corpus.",
        "The consolidated relevance score (PCC-H) is 75% for SimM vs. 25% for DivS, as shown in Table 1.",
        "These scores indicate the superiority of SimM over DivS.",
        "In other words, separating the mixture of topics of a fragment into multiple topically-separated queries mitigates the negative effect of the mixture of topics on the suggestions.",
        "6.2 Comparison across Merging Techniques Binary comparisons were then performed between pairs of merging techniques (SimM, Round-robin, and DivM), using the same experimental settings.",
        "The PCC-H scores are 62% for DivM vs. 38% for Round-robin, 59% for DivM vs. 41% for SimM, and 56% for Round-robin vs. 44% for SimM, as shown in Table 1.",
        "The scores show that the diverse merging of lists of documents improves recommendations, and indicate the following high to low ranking: DivM > Round-robin > SimM.",
        "SimM ranks lowest in this ordering, likely because of the ignorance of diversity in the list of results.",
        "Round-robin is second, likely because it disregards the major differences of importance among implicit queries in a conversation fragment.",
        "The results of the comparisons confirm that the DivM technique, which merges lists of documents by considering the diversity of topics in the list of recommendations, in proportion to their importance in the conversation, is the most satisfying to the majority of human subjects.",
        "6.3 Impact of the Topical Diversity of Fragments To further examine the benefits of our method, we studied its sensitivity to the number of topics in the conversation fragments.",
        "For this purpose, we divided the set of test fragments into two subsets.",
        "The first one (noted ?A?",
        "in Table 1) gathers the fragments for which fewer than or exactly five main topics (and therefore implicit queries) have been computed.",
        "The other fragments, with more than five main topics, form the second subset (noted ?B?).",
        "The value of five corresponds to the average number of main topics per fragment as well as to the number of recommended documents in our experiments.",
        "As shown in Table 1, although there is an improvement in the comparison scores of DivS over SimM when the number of conveyed topics in the fragments is higher than the number of recommended documents (subset B), the comparison scores indicate the superiority of SimM over DivS in both cases, and 595 PCC-H relevance score (%) Raw preferences (%) Compared methods A B A ?",
        "B A ?",
        "B (m 1 vs.m 2 ) m 1 m 2 m 1 m 2 m 1 m 2 m 1 m 2 SimM vs. DivS 80 20 70 30 75 25 70 30 Round-robin vs. SimM 33 67 68 32 56 44 52 48 DivM vs. Round-robin 64 36 60 40 62 38 58 42 DivM vs. SimM 54 46 60 40 59 41 58 42 Table 1: Comparative scores of the recommended document lists from four methods: DivS, SimM, Round-robin, and DivM, evaluated by human judges over the ELEA Corpus.",
        "Subset A gathers fragments with fewer than or exactly five topics, while subset B gathers all the other fragments.",
        "The results imply the following ranking: DivM > Round-robin > SimM > DivS.",
        "confirm the benefit of the diverse merging techniques.",
        "When comparing Round-robin versus SimM, the scores show the superiority of the former method when the number of conveyed topics in fragments is higher than the number of recommended documents, because it provides a diverse lists of documents in which documents relevant to less important topics are not displayed.",
        "However, when the number of topics is smaller than the number of recommendations, SimM provides better results.",
        "The reason of the decrease in the scores of Round-robin is likely the ignorance of the actual importance of the main topics when ranking documents.",
        "Overall, as shown in Table 1, regardless of the number of topics conveyed in the fragments, DivM always outperforms Round-robin and SimM.",
        "6.4 Example of Document Results To illustrate how DivM surpasses the other techniques, we consider an example from one of the conversation fragments of the ELEA Corpus.",
        "The manual transcript of this conversation fragment is given in the Appendix A.",
        "As described in Section 5, the conversation participants had to select a list of 12 items vital to survive in winter while waiting to be rescued.",
        "The keywords extracted from the manual transcript of this fragment by our method (Habibi and Popescu-Belis, 2013) are: fire, lighter, cloth, shoe, cold, die, igloo, walking.",
        "As our keyword extraction method was shown to be robust to ASR noise, we only use here the reference transcripts (Habibi and Popescu-Belis, submitted).",
        "We display the topically-aware implicit queries prepared by our method from this keyword list along with their weights in Table 2.",
        "Then, in Table 3 we show the retrieval results (five highest-ranked Wikipedia pages) obtained by the four methods using the reference transcript of this fragment.",
        "As shown in Table 2, each implicit query corresponds to one of the main topics of the fragment with a specific weight.",
        "In this example, the main topics spoken in the fragment are about making an igloo, lightening a fire, having warm clothes, and suitable shoes for walking.",
        "As shown in Table 3, DivS provides two irrelevant documents likely because the single (collective) query does not separate the mixture of topics in the conversation fragment, and leads to some poor results (Wikipedia pages) such as ?Cold Fire (Koontz novel)?.",
        "SimM slightly improves the results by separating the discussed topics of the conversation fragment into multiple queries.",
        "However, it does not cover all the Implicit queries Weights q 1 = {fire, cold, igloo, lighter} w 1 = 0.110 q 2 = {shoe, lighter, walking} w 2 = 0.097 q 3 = {cloth} w 3 = 0.058 q 4 = {die} w 4 = 0.040 q 5 = {igloo} w 5 = 0.026 Table 2: Example of implicit queries built from the keyword list extracted from a sample fragment of the ELEA Corpus.",
        "Each query covers one of the main topics of the fragment and has a different weight.",
        "596 DivS SimM Round-robin DivM Flint spark lighter Igloo Igloo Igloo Extended Cold Flint spark lighter Shoe Shoe Weather Clothing System Cold Fire (Koontz novel) Lighter Jersey (clothing) Flint spark lighter Igloo Lighter (barge) Die Hard Jersey (clothing) Walking Worcester Cold Flint spark lighter Lighter Storage Warehouse fire Table 3: Example of retrieved Wikipedia pages from the four different methods tested in this paper.",
        "Results of diverse merging (DivM) appear to cover more topics relevant to the conversation fragment than other methods.",
        "The average ranking (DivM > Round-robin > SimM > DivS) is also observed in this example.",
        "topics mentioned in the fragment due to mostly focusing on the single topic represented by q 1 .",
        "Round-robin further enhances the results by adding diversity, but as it gives the same level of importance to all topics, it provides a poor result like ?Die Hard?",
        "from a topic of the conversation fragment with a small weight.",
        "The results of DivM appear to be the most useful ones, as they include other articles relevant to q 1 , q 2 , and q 3 before showing results relevant to the low weight queries q 4 and q 5 .",
        "Therefore, in this example, DivM provides better ranking of documents by covering the largest number of main topics mentioned in the fragment.",
        "7 Conclusion We proposed a diverse merging technique for combining lists of documents from multiple topically-separated implicit queries, prepared using keyword lists obtained from the transcripts of conversation fragments.",
        "Our diverse merging method DivM provides a short, diverse, and relevant list of recommen-dations, which avoids distracting participants that would consider it during the conversation.",
        "We also compared DivM to existing merging techniques, in terms of comprehensiveness and relevance of the final recommended list of documents to the conversation fragment.",
        "The human judgments collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk showed that DivM outperforms all other methods.",
        "Moreover, these results emphasized the benefit of splitting the keyword set into multiple topically-separated queries: the suggested lists of documents from DivS (which accounts for the diversity of results by re-ranking the documents of a single list) were indeed found less relevant than those from SimM and the other two methods, which merged results from multiple queries.",
        "In the future, the diverse merging method DivM will be integrated in the ACLD just-in-time retrieval system for conversational environments, with implicit queries that are prepared from the ASR transcript of users?",
        "conversation.",
        "User-oriented evaluation experiments will be conducted.",
        "We will also enable the system to answer explicit queries asked by users, considering contextual factors to improve the relevance of the answers, which will complement the recommendation functionality based on implicit queries.",
