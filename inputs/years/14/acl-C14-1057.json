        "Infographics are non-pictorial graphics such as bar charts and line graphs.",
        "When such graphics appear in popular media, they generally have a high-level message that they are intended to convey.",
        "For example, the graphic in Figure 1 ostensibly conveys the message that Toyota has the highest profit among the automobile companies listed.",
        "Thus infographics are a form of language since, according to Clark (Clark and Curran, 2007), language is any deliberate signal that is intended to convey a message.",
        "Although much research has addressed the retrieval of documents, very little attention has been given to the retrieval of infographics.",
        "Yet research has shown that the content of an infographic is often not included in the article's text (Carberry et al., 2006).",
        "Thus infographics are an important knowledge source that should be accessible to users of a digital library.",
        "Techniques that have been effective for document or image retrieval are inadequate for the retrieval of infographics.",
        "Current search engines employ strategies similar to those used in document retrieval, relying primarily on the text surrounding a graphic and web link structures.",
        "But the text in the surrounding document generally does not refer explicitly to the infographic or even describe its content (Carberry et al., 2006).",
        "An obvious extension to using the article text would be to collect all the words in an infographic and use it as a bag of words.",
        "However, infographics have structure and often a high-level message, and bag of words approaches ignore this structure and message content.",
        "This paper explores the features that should be taken into account when ranking graphics for retrieval in response to a user query.",
        "Using a learning-to-rank algorithm on a wide range of features (including structural and content features), we produce a model that performs significantly better than a model that ignores graph structure and content.",
        "Analysis of the model shows that features based on the structure and content of graphs are very important and should not be ignored.",
        "To our knowledge, our research is the first to take graph structure and content into account when retrieving infographics.",
        "600 Figure 1: An Example Infographic 2 Related Work Information retrieval research has focused on the retrieval of text documents and images.",
        "Two popular approaches to text retrieval are the vector space method and probabilistic methods.",
        "The vector space method (Dubin, 2004) represents the document and the query each as a vector of weighted words and then uses a similarity function to measure the similarity of each document to the query.",
        "Most weighting mechanisms reward words that occur frequently in both the document and query but infrequently in the overall collection of documents.",
        "Probabilistic retrieval models instead estimate the probability that a document is relevant to a user query.",
        "In recent years, the language modeling approach has shown promise as a retrieval strategy with sound statistical underpinnings (Lv and Zhai, 2009; Manning et al., 2008).",
        "In all of the above approaches, query expansion techniques have been used to expand the query with synonyms and related words before ranking documents for retrieval.",
        "Work on short document and query expansion have shown improvements in retrieval performance (Arguello et al., 2008; Escalante et al., 2008; Metzler and Cai, 2011).",
        "Work in Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) (Datta et al., 2008) has progressed from systems that retrieved images based solely on visual similarity, relying on low-level features such as color, texture and shape ( (Flickner et al., 1995; Swain and Ballard, 1991; Smith and Chang, 1997; Gupta and Jain, 1997), among others), to systems which attempt to classify and reason about the semantics of the images being processed (Bradshaw, 2000; Smeulders et al., 2000; Datta et al., 2008).",
        "However, images are free-form with relatively little inherent structure; thus it is extremely difficult to determine what is conveyed by an image, other than to list the image's constituent pieces.",
        "Most systems that retrieve infographics, such as SpringerImages (http://www.springerimages.com) and Zanran (http://www.zanran.com), are based on textual annotations of the graphics as in image retrieval (Gao et al., 2011) or on matching the user's query against the text surrounding the graphic.",
        "However, the structure and content of the graph are not taken into consideration.",
        "In this paper, we focus on natural language queries given that such queries allow users to express their specific information need more clearly than keywords (Phan et al., 2007; Bendersky and Croft, 2009).",
        "Previous work on verbose and natural language queries (Bendersky and Croft, 2008; Liu et al., 2013) used probabilistic models and natural language processing techniques to identify the key contents in such queries.",
        "Our query processing method not only extracts key entities but also further classifies the extracted key entities into different components using a learned decision tree model.",
        "3 Problem Formulation Our research is currently limited to two kinds of infographics: simple bar charts and single line graphs.",
        "We assume that our digital library contains an XML representation of each graphic that includes 1) the graphic's image, 2) its structural components: the set of independent axis (x-axis) labels 1 , the entity being measured on the dependent axis (y-axis), and the text that appears in the graphic's caption, referred to as G x , G y , and G c respectively, and 3) the graphic's intended message G m and any entities G f that the 1 We will refer to the independent axis as the x-axis and the dependent axis as the y-axis throughout this paper.",
        "601 message focuses on.",
        "This paper is not concerned with the computer vision problem of recognizing the bars, labels, colors, etc.",
        "in a graphic; other research efforts, such as the work in (Chester and Elzer, 2005; Futrelle and Nikolakis, 1995) are addressing the parsing of electronic images such as bar charts and line graphs.",
        "Prior research on our project has addressed issues that arise in recognizing G y , G m , and G f .",
        "The dependent axis of an infographic often does not explicitly label what is being measured, such as net profit in Figure 1, and these must be inferred from other text in the graphic.",
        "Our prior work (Demir et al., 2007) identified a hierarchy of graphic components in which pieces of the entity being measured might appear; a set of heuristics were constructed that extracted these pieces and melded them together to form what we refer to as a measurement axis descriptor and which is G y .",
        "The project's prior work also identified a set of 17 categories of intended message, such as Rank, Relative-difference, Maximum, and Rising-trend, that might be conveyed by simple bar charts and line graphs; a Bayesian system (Elzer et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2010) was developed that utilizes communicative signals in a graphic (such as the coloring of one bar differently from the other bars) in order to recognize a graphic's intended message, including both the message category and the parameters of the message such as any focused entity.",
        "For example, the intended message of the bar chart in Figure 1 is ostensibly that Toyota has the highest net profit of any of the automobile manufacturers listed; thus its message falls into the Maximum message category and its focused entity is Toyota.",
        "Our vision is that since graphics have structure and content, the users whose particular information needs could be satisfied by an infographic will formulate their queries to indicate the requisite structure of the desired graphics.",
        "Thus we assume the use of full-sentence queries so that the semantics of the query can be analyzed to identify characteristics of relevant graphics.",
        "For example, consider the following two queries that contain similar keywords but represent different information needs: Q 1 : Which countries have the highest occurrence of rare diseases?",
        "Q 2 : Which rare diseases occur in the most countries?",
        "These two queries contain almost identical words but are asking for completely different graphics.",
        "Query Q 1 is asking for a comparison of countries (independent axis) according to their occurrence of rare diseases (dependent axis) while query Q 2 is asking for a comparison of different rare diseases (independent axis) according to the number of countries in which they occur (dependent axis).",
        "In addition, both queries are asking for a graphic with a Rank message that ranks countries (query Q 1 ) or rare diseases (query Q 2 ) as opposed to a graphic that shows the trend in rare diseases throughout the world.",
        "4 Methodology To retrieve relevant graphics in response to a user query, the query will first be analyzed to identify requisite characteristics of relevant infographics.",
        "We have developed learned decision trees (Li et al., 2013a; Li et al., 2013b) for analyzing a query and identifying the requisite structure of relevant infographics (the content of the independent axis or x-axis and dependent axis or y-axis, referred to as Q x and Q y ), and the category of intended message and focused entity, if any, (referred to as Q m and Q f ) that will best satisfy the user's information need.",
        "Given a new user query, it is parsed and noun phrases are extracted.",
        "Each query-phrase pair, consisting of a query and an extracted noun phrase, is processed by a decision tree that determines whether the noun phrase represents x-axis content, y-axis content, or neither.",
        "Attributes used by this decision tree include whether the main verb of the query is a comparison verb (such as ?differ?",
        "and ?compare?)",
        "or a trend verb (such as ?change?",
        "and ?decrease?",
        "), whether the noun phrase is preceded by a quantity phrase such as ?the number of?",
        "suggesting that the noun phrase specifies y-axis content of relevant infographics, and whether the noun phrase describes a period of time.",
        "Similarly, another decision tree is constructed to identify the category of graph intended message (such as Trend or Rank) that the query desires, using a subset of the attributes from the axes decision tree combined with the classification results of the axes decision tree.",
        "An example of the reused attributes is the class of the main verb in the user query; for example, a comparison main verb suggests that relevant infographics will convey a comparison-based intended message, such as a Relative-difference or Rank 602 intended message.",
        "Other attributes include the presence of a superlative or comparative in the query and attributes depending on the identified content of the x and y axes by the axes decision tree, such as the number of x-axis entities, their plurality, and whether an x-axis entity describes a time interval.",
        "A third decision tree is constructed for identifying whether a noun phrase describes a specific focused x-axis entity.",
        "Then the infographics in the digital library must be rank-ordered according to how well they satisfy the requirements of the user query.",
        "This paper is concerned with identifying the most important features in a metric for rank-ordering the graphics in response to a user query.",
        "We experiment with two learning-to-rank algorithms and 56 features that include both general features such as bag of words comparisons and structural and content features.",
        "Our hypothesis is that structural and content-based features play an important role in graph retrieval and cannot be ignored.",
        "Section 5 discusses the features used in our experiments, Section 6 discusses the learning algorithms, Section 6.1 compares the resultant models with a baseline that uses just general features treating query and graphic each as one bag of words, and Section 6.2 discusses the features that appear most influential in the models.",
        "5 Features We consider three kinds of features: 1) general features that compare words in the query with words in the graphic, 2) structural features that compare the requisite structure hypothesized from the query with the structure of candidate infographics, and 3) content-based features that compare the requisite message hypothesized from the user query with the intended message of candidate graphics.",
        "Query expansion is a commonly used strategy in information retrieval to bridge the vocabulary gap between terms in a query and those in documents.",
        "The basic idea is to expand the original query with terms that are semantically similar to the ones in the query.",
        "This addresses the problem encountered when the query uses the word car but the document uses the term automobile.",
        "But retrieval of information graphics presents an additional problem.",
        "Consider a query such as ?Which car manufacturer has the highest net profit??",
        "A graphic such as the one in Figure 1 displays a set of car manufacturers on the x-axis (Toyota, Nissan, etc.)",
        "but nowhere in the graphic does the word car or a synonym appear.",
        "Identifying the ontological category, such as car or automobile, of these labels is crucial since the user's query often generalizes the entities on the independent axis of relevant graphs rather than listing them.",
        "To expand a given text string s, we use Wikimantic (Boston et al., 2013), a term expansion method that uses Wikipedia articles as topic concepts.",
        "A topic concept is a unigram distribution built from words in the Wikipedia article for that topic.",
        "A string s is interpreted by Wikimantic into a mixture concept that is a weighted vector of topic concepts that capture the semantic meaning of the words in s. Each topic concept is weighted by the likelihood that the concept (Wikipedia article) generates the text string s. The weighted concepts are then used to produce a unigram distribution of words that serve as the expansion of the terms in the string s. One issue in graph retrieval is correlating the requisite x-axis content specified in the user query with the x-axis labels in graphs.",
        "A query such as ?Which car manufacturer has ...",
        "??",
        "is requesting a graph where ?car manufacturers?",
        "are listed on the x-axis.",
        "Thus we need to recognize individual x-axis words which are often proper nouns (e.g., ?Ford?, ?Nissan?, ?Honda?)",
        "as instances of car manufacturers.",
        "In the case of labels on the independent axis (such as Toyota, Nissan, Honda, etc.",
        "), words such as car or automobile are part of the produced unigram distribution ?",
        "that is, as a side effect, the ontological category of the individual entities becomes part of the term expansion.",
        "We use Wikimantic to interpret and expand each of the graph components G x , G y , G f , and G c .",
        "The expansion of the graph components (as opposed to the typical expansion of the query) accomplishes two objectives: 1) it addresses the problem of sparse graphic text by adding semantically similar words and 2) it addresses the problem of terms in the query capturing general classes (such as car or automobile) when the graphic instead contains an enumeration of members of the general class.",
        "Expansion of the words in the graphics, unlike query expansion, has the added advantage that it is completed in advance and off-line.",
        "603 5.1 General Features Our general feature set includes 17 general features capturing a variety of different kinds of relevance scorings between two bags of words consisting respectively of words from the user query and words from the candidate infographic: ?",

        "Okapi-BM25 is a bag-of-words ranking function used in many information retrieval systems.",
        "Our modified version of Okapi-BM25 addresses the problem of negative values that can occur with the original Okapi formula.",

        "One additional feature that is specific to the y-axis is: ?",
        "SFY 5 : The posterior probability of the Wikimantic (Boston et al., 2013) mixture concept 2 for the y-axis words hypothesized from the query, given the Wikimantic mixture concept representing the y-axis words in the graph, referred to as p(Q y |G y ).",
        "Both query y-axis words and the graphic y-axis 2 A Wikimantic mixture concept is a set of weighted concepts (Boston et al., 2013).",
        "604 descriptor are each interpreted by Wikimantic into a mixture concept, M qy and M gy respectively.",
        "Recall from the introduction to Section 5 that a mixture concept is a weighted vector of topic concepts that defines the semantic meaning of a term or set of terms.",
        "For example, the mixture concept for the country China is represented by a vector of topic concepts such as ?China?, ?People's Republic of China?, ?Mainland China?, and so on.",
        "Wikimantic estimates the probability of a concept given another concept by the amount of overlapping words between the two concepts.",
        "For example, the topic concept for the country ?United States?",
        "is likely to contain similar words to the concept for ?China?, such as the words ?country?, ?nation?, ?region?, ?capital?, ?GDP?, etc.",
        "Therefore the probability of United States given China is likely to be higher than that of United States given the topic ?rugby?.",
        "5.3 Content Features Our content feature set contains four features that address how well the intended message of a graphic captures the requisite message content hypothesized from the user's query.",
        "Ideally, a relevant graphic's intended message G m will match the message category Q m hypothesized from the user's query.",
        "When the two do not match exactly, we use a hierarchy of message categories and the concept of relaxation as the paradigm for estimating how much perceptual effort would be required to extract the message specified by the query from the graphic.",
        "For example, suppose that the query requests a Rank message; graphics with Rank messages will convey the rank of a specific entity by arranging the entities in order of value and highlighting in some way the entity whose rank is being conveyed.",
        "Graphics with a Rank-all intended message will convey the rank of a set of entities without highlighting any specific entity; the Rank-all message category appears as a parent of Rank in the message hierarchy since it is less specific than Rank.",
        "Although one can identify the rank of a specific entity from a graphic whose intended message is a Rank-all message, it is perceptually more difficult since one must search through the graph for the entity whose rank is desired.",
        "By moving up or down the message hierarchy from Q m to G m , Q m is relaxed to match different G m .",

        "and ?How does Avis rank compared to other car rental companies in revenue??.",
        "We used the collected queries to search on popular commercial image search engines to get more infographics from the same topics.",
        "These commercial search engines include Google Image, Microsoft Bing Image Search, and Picsearch.",

        "A query-infographic pair was assigned 3 points if the infographic was considered highly relevant to the query and 0 points if it was irrelevant.",
        "Query-infographic pairs where the graphic was somewhat relevant to the query were assigned 1 or 2 points, depending on the judged degree of relevance of the graphic to the query.",
        "This produced a corpus for training and testing.",
        "Using MART and Random Forest, we developed four models from all 56 features, including the structural and content features.",
        "Two of the models were built using our learned decision trees (Li et al., 2013b; Li et al., 2013a) to analyze the queries and hypothesize the requisite x-axis content, y-axis content, message category, and focused entity (if any); see the second row of Table 1.",
        "Since the learned decision trees are not perfect, the other two models were built from hand-labelled data; see the last row of Table 1.",

        "In each case, we averaged together the NDCG results of 10 runs using the Bootstrapping Method (Tan et al., 2006) in which the query data set is sampled with replacement to select 152 queries; these 152 queries, and for each query the relevance judgements assigned to each of the graphics, comprised the training set, with the unselected queries and their relevance judgements comprising the testing set.",
        "The Bootstrapping method is a widely used evaluation method for small datasets.",
        "Typically, approximately 63% of the dataset is selected for the training set (with some items appearing more than once in the training set) and 37% for the testing set.",
        "The second row of Table 1 provides results when each query is processed by our learned decision trees to extract the structural content and message category that the query specifies.",

        "To determine whether our system could do even better if the decision trees were improved, the third row of Table 1 reports results when each query was hand-labelled with the correctly extracted structural and message content.",
        "The models using all 56 features produced significantly better results than the baseline model that used just the general features, indicating that structural and content-based features are very important and must be taken into account in graph retrieval.",
        "In addition, the models built from the hand-labelled data produced better results than the models where the structural and content features were automatically extracted from the queries using the learned decision trees; this suggests that improving the decision trees that process the queries would improve the accuracy of the learned graph retrieval models.",
        "In some cases, the Random Forest learned model performed better than the MART model, but the improvement was not significant.",
        "The experimental results show that both MART and Random Forest using all 56 features, either using the hand-labelled query data or decision tree query data, provide significantly better results than the baseline approach (p<0.0005).",

        "All of the models improve as k increases.",
        "Most important, both our MART and Random Forest models constructed from all 56 features perform much better than the baseline models for all values of k.

        "The most influential two features in trees produced by MART were SFY 5 which captures p(Q y | G y ) and SFX 2 which captures the tf-idf of x-axis words hypothesized from the query that appear in the expansion of the x-axis labels in the graphic.",
        "Although these two features were not the two most influential features in the trees produced by Random Forest, they did appear among the top 5 features.",
        "Two content-based features appeared among the top ten most important features: CF 3 which captures the relevance of the focused entity Q f (if any) hypothesized from the query to the focused entity G f (if any) in the graphic and CF 4 which captures the relevance of the focused entity Q f (if any) hypothesized from the query to the non-focused entities G fx in the graphic.",
        "The content features CF 1 and CF 2 that measure relevance of the message category hypothesized from the query to the intended message category in a candidate graphic appeared among the top 20 features but not among the top 10 features.",
        "Further inspection of the trees and analysis of the queries and graphics leads us to believe that message category relevance is influential in refining the ranking of graphics once graphics with appropriate structural content have been identified.",
        "Our future work will examine these two features more closely and determine whether modifications of them, or changes in how they are used, will improve results.",
        "Based on these results, we conclude that structural and content-based features are important when ranking infographics for retrieval and must be taken into account in an effective graph retrieval system.",
        "7 Conclusion and Future Work To our knowledge, no other research effort has considered the use of structural and content-based features when ranking graphics for retrieval from a digital library.",
        "We developed learned models that take into account how well the structure and content of an infographic matches the requisite structure and content hypothesized from the user query, and showed that these models perform significantly better than baseline models that ignore graph structure and message content.",
        "In addition, an analysis of the learned models showed which structural and content features were most influential.",
        "In our future work, we will improve our methods for hypothesizing requisite features of relevant graphics and will analyze our relaxation metric to determine whether an improved metric will play a more influential role in ranking graphics for retrieval.",
