        "Abstract",
        "We present a novel approach for analysing and classifying lyrics, experimenting both with n-gram models and more sophisticated features that model different dimensions of a song text, such as vocabulary, style, semantics, orientation towards the world, and song structure.",
        "We show that these can be combined with n-gram features to obtain performance gains on three different classification tasks: genre detection, distinguishing the best and the worst songs, and determining the approximate publication time of a song."

        "The ever growing amount of music available on the internet calls for intelligent tools for browsing and searching music databases.",
        "Music recommendation and retrieval systems can aid users in finding music that is relevant to them.",
        "This typically requires automatic music analysis, e.g., classification according to genre, content or artist and song similarity.",
        "In addition, automatic music (and lyrics) analysis also offers potential benefits for musicology research, for instance, in the field of Sociomusicology where lyrics analysis is used to place a piece of music in its sociocultural context (Frith, 1988).",
        "In principle, both the audio signal and the lyrics (if any exist) can be used to analyse a music piece (as well as additional data such as album reviews (Baumann et al., 2004)).",
        "In this paper, we focus on the contribution of the lyrics.",
        "Songwriters deploy unique stylistic devices to build their lyrics.",
        "Some of those can be measured automatically and we hypothesise that these are distinctive enough to identify song classes such as genre, song quality and publication time.",
        "There is, in fact, strong empirical evidence that it is worthwhile to look deeper into lyrical properties when analysing and classifying music.",
        "For example, it has been shown that classifiers that incorporate textual features outperform audio-only classifiers on most classification tasks (Mayer et al., 2008a; Mayer and Rauber, 2011; Li and Ogihara, 2004).",
        "Lyrics are also often easier to obtain and process than audio data, and non-musicians, in particular, often rely strongly on lyrics when interacting with a music retrieval system (Baumann and Kl?uter, 2002; Bainbridge et al., 2003).",
        "Moreover, lyrics do not only add semantic content, they can serve as an (easily observable) proxy for the melodic, structural and rhythmic properties of the audio signal.",
        "Melody and rhythm, for example, can often be traced in the stress pattern of the text (Nichols et al., 2009), while a song's overall structure is reflected in the order of textual elements such as chorus, verse and bridge.",
        "Psychological research also provides evidence the audio and textual content are indeed processed independently in the brain and hence are complementary for our appreciation of a song (Besson et al., 1998).",
        "We extend previous research on lyrics-based song classification in two important ways: First, while earlier approaches mostly used fairly shallow textual features, such as bags-of-words, we designed features that model semantic and stylistic properties of lyrics at a much deeper level and show that these features can indeed be beneficial.",
        "Second, we address two novel classification tasks beyond genre detec-tion, namely distinguishing ?best?",
        "and ?worst?",
        "songs 1 and determining the approximate publication time, and show that these can also be tackled by lyrics analysis.",
        "1 There is a growing body of work on automatic hit prediction but we would argue that this is a different task as hits are not necessarily qualitatively good songs and vice versa.",
        "620 2 Related Work This study draws on earlier work on text classification, including genre detection (Lustrek, 2007) and authorship attribution (Stamatatos, 2009; Holmes, 1994), but also more specifically on poetry analysis (Simonton, 1990) and, in particular, lyrics-based music classification.",
        "Generally, shallow features, such as average word and sentence length, part-of-speech and function word distribution tend to work well for authorship and genre classification, while content word distribution is more indicative of the topic.",
        "Recent work on text classification has also employed deeper features, such as distributions of syntactic constructions (see e.g., Kim et al. (2010)).",
        "However, not all features that work well for prose carry over to song lyrics.",
        "Syntax, for example, is strongly constrained by meter.",
        "On the other hand, additional features like meter and rhyme properties might be useful.",
        "So far, most studies on lyrics classification have used rather simple features, for example (tf-idf weighted) bags-of-words (Neumayer and Rauber, 2007; Mahedero et al., 2005; Logan et al., 2004), sometimes enriched by synonymy and hypernymy information (Scott and Matwin, 1998).",
        "Mayer et al. (2008a; 2008b) also include POS tag distributions, simple text statistics (avg.",
        "word length, proportion of hapax legomena per document/line, distribution of punctuation marks and digits, words per minute) and simple (end-of-line) rhyme features.",
        "Li and Ogihara (2004) use a similar feature set but also include function word distributions.",
        "Finally, Hirjee and Brown (2010) analyse Rap lyrics and focus exclusively on rhyme features, providing a sophisticated statistical rhyme detector which can also identify in-line and slant rhymes.",
        "We build on this work but extend the feature space with more explicit modelling of abstract stylistic and linguistic dimensions such as vocabulary, style, semantics, orientation of the song content with respect to the world and overall song structure.",
        "3 Material Since no large lyrics dataset was publicly available (cf. Mayer and Rauber (2011)), we had to collect our own.",
        "2 Song lyrics are widely available across the internet in the form of user-generated content.",
        "We chose Lyricsmode 3 because of its large coverage and subjectively high consistency.",
        "Even so, a certain amount of inconsistency and noise remains.",
        "We employed heuristics to clean the data, e.g., to remove duplicate song texts and normalise the notation style of different users.",
        "4 Only English lyrics were included; songs in other languages were filtered out using language detection.",
        "5 Furthermore, to minimise data sparseness, songs were only included if more than 20 song texts were available for the corresponding artist.",
        "The final corpus consists of roughly 400k English song texts of 7.2k artists.",
        "6 For the experiments, the lyrics were POS tagged 7 and chunked.",
        "8 In addition to the lyrics themselves, we need three types of metadata for our experiments: genre information, quality ratings, and publication time.",
        "In all experiments, we classify songs rather than artists or albums.",
        "However, to avoid artist effects on our results, we control for the artist, i.e., we make sure that the test set does not contain (songs of) an artist if the training set already contains (songs of) the same artist; test and training set are completely disjunct with respect to artists.",
        "9 Because of this, we need to ensure a sufficient number of artists for each output class in the three experiments.",
        "2 The Million Song Database (Bertin-Mahieux et al., 2011), a large publicly available data set for music classification, does not contain lyrics and the only available data set that does contain lyrics, SLAC (McKay et al., 2010), only contains lyrics for 160 songs, which is too small to train and test on.",
        "3 http://www.lyricsmode.com 4 See Fell (2014) for more details on the heuristics used in the present study and Knees et al. (2005) for an overview of the types of noise typically encountered and general methods for cleaning.",
        "5 A freely available Java library for language detection (Shuyo, 2010) was used.",
        "6 Note that there is no guarantee that the artist also wrote the lyrics.",
        "The corpus might contain covers and lyrics/songs that were written ?on request?.",
        "However, performers do not choose their songs randomly but try to stick to songs that fit in with their preferred genre and style.",
        "7 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml 8 https://opennlp.apache.org 9 Most previous studies did not explicitly control for this.",
        "However, we noticed in a preliminary experiment that the results can be notably inflated if training and test set overlap in artists.",
        "For genre classification, we saw an increase in F-Score of up to 7%, while for publication time classification, the F-Score increased by up to 12% (Fell, 2014).",
        "This indicates that lyrics may provide a stronger signal for the artist than for other classes such as genre or publication time.",
        "621 Genre information was obtained from Allmusic, 10 which classifies artists and bands according to 21 coarse-grained genres and numerous subgenres.",
        "We excluded artists who experimented with several genres like Peter Gabriel (Pop/Rock, International) or Prince (R&B, Pop/Rock, Electronic) because in that case it is not clear which genre a particular song belongs to.",
        "As most genres occur only sparsely in our corpus, we focused on the nine most common genres, 11 resulting in a data set of 4,712 artists from the nine major genres with the following numbers of artists per genre: Pop/Rock: 2602, Metal: 1140, Rap: 390, Country: 225, R&B: 153, Religious: 118, Reggae: 38, Blues: 26, Folk: 20.",
        "Besides genre, we retrieved album ratings and publication years from Rateyourmusic.",
        "12 Album ratings range from 0 stars (worst) to 5 stars (best) and are typically averaged over hundreds to thousands user ratings.",
        "To exclude ?one-hit-wonders?, only artists with at least two rated albums were considered.",
        "Theoretically, it would be possible to assign all songs a rating by transferring an album rating to all songs in the album.",
        "However, in practice this is difficult to do robustly because album ratings and lyrics come from different sites and are not trivial to align.",
        "Song listings for an album are sometimes incomplete and song titles noisy, making it difficult to map album ratings directly to songs.",
        "As a way around this we map album ratings to artists (which are much more robustly identifiable from the metadata) and then compute an overall artist rating as the median over all album ratings for the artist.",
        "Each song by the artist is then assigned this rating.",
        "Basically, we hypothesise that a good artist consistently writes good songs, which is, obviously, a simplifying assumption.",
        "4 Features We designed 13 feature classes, consisting of one or more related features each, and grouped them into five abstract sets, reflecting different stylistic and linguistic dimensions (see Table 1).",
        "13 Model Dimension Feature Classes topK vocabulary: output class specific top 100 n-grams (n ?",
        "3) extended vocabulary: type-token ratio, non-standard words style: POS/chunk tags, length, echoisms, rhyme features semantics: imagery orientation: pronouns, past tense song structure: chorus, title, repetitive structures Table 1: Overview of features As a baseline (topK), we implemented an n-gram model, which captures words and collocations that are most specific to an output class.",
        "This model can be considered ?uninformed?",
        "in that it does not attempt to represent abstract stylistic or structural properties.",
        "We rank n-grams according to the tf-idf for the class (i.e., the genres are considered ?documents?",
        "and the frequency of an n-gram is incremented by 1 for each song in which it occurs).",
        "To reduce the impact of vocabulary preferences of individual artists, we then re-rank by discounting n-grams which are too artist-specific.",
        "The top 100 n-grams (for n ?",
        "3) are represented in the feature vector.",
        "14 The remaining features (extended) attempt to model the following five dimensions of the lyrics: VOCABULARY: These features estimate the vocabulary richness (type-token ratio for n-grams up to n = 3) and the use of non-standard words, i.e., uncommon and slang words.",
        "Uncommon words are defined as words not found in Wiktionary.",
        "15 Slang words are defined as words contained in the Urban Dictionary, 16 but not in Wiktionary.",
        "We encode the (normalised) logarithmic frequency of slang words and the ratio of uncommon words to all words.",
        "10 http://www.allmusic.com 11 We excluded the, also fairly frequent, genre Electronic as it is mainly musically defined (Logan et al., 2004).",
        "12 http://www.rateyourmusic.com 13 Note that features are normalised by the length of the lyrics where necessary.",
        "14 The total number of encoded n-gram features is maximally 300 per output class but can be less, since n-grams common to multiple classes are encoded only once.",
        "15 http://en.wiktionary.org 16 http://www.urbandictionary.com 622 STYLE: We employed the POS and chunk tag distributions as proxies for syntactic structure.",
        "To reduce data sparseness, all tags are mapped to supertags such as V, N, ADV.",
        "We also implemented various length features (lines per song, tokens per song, tokens per line).",
        "Rhyme structure is modelled by encoding the output of the rhyme detection tool by Hirjee and Brown (2010), which detects perfect and imperfect in-line and line final rhymes.",
        "Repetitions of letters (?riiiiise?)",
        "or words (?money, money?)",
        "are common in lyrics and often caused by a mismatch between number of syllables and line meter but they can also be employed as a means for emphasis and indicating emotion.",
        "We collectively dub such repetitions echoisms.",
        "We also group in-line (slant) rhymes (?burning turning?, ?where were we?)",
        "under ?echoisms?.",
        "Echoisms are computed by looking for words with letter repetitions or word sequences with a relatively high similarity (according to an edit distance measure).",
        "Frequencies per type (letter reduplication, word repetition) and sequence length (less or more than 3 words) are encoded.",
        "SEMANTICS: Lyrics can vary widely with respect to the topics they mention and the images they evoke.",
        "Instead of using a linguistic model of semantic fields, we opted to build on work in psychology and use the Regressive Imagery Dictionary (RID) (Martindale, 1975; Martindale, 1990) to identify predominant concepts (?imageries?)",
        "in a text.",
        "RID classifies words as belonging to the separate fields ?conceptual thought?",
        "(abstract, logical, reality-oriented), ?primordial thought?",
        "(associative, con-crete, fantasy), and ?emotion?.",
        "For example, the imagery ?Moral?",
        "(conceptual) contains words such as ?should?, ?right?, and ?virtue?.",
        "Whereas the imagery ?sensation?",
        "(primordial) contains ?delicious?, ?perceive?, and ?glamour?.",
        "We chose this resource because, intuitively, it is not only important what is said but also how it is said and the RID seemed to capture both aspects well.",
        "We computed the dominant imageries for each text and encoded this information in the feature vector.",
        "ORIENTATION: This dimension models how the song narrative (entities, events) is oriented with respect to the world.",
        "We encode a temporal dimension, i.e., whether the song mainly recounts past experiences or present/future ones, by representing the fraction of past tense verb forms to all verb forms as a feature.",
        "We also model how ?egocentric?",
        "a song is.",
        "We compute pronoun frequencies for 1st, 2nd, 3rd singular and plural person.",
        "As derived features, we also encode the proportion of self-referencing pronouns (first person singular/plural) to non-self-referencing ones and the ratio of first person singular pronouns to second person.",
        "The former feature measures the degree of talking about oneself as opposed to talking about other people, the latter measures whether the ?I?",
        "or the ?you?",
        "carries more weight in an interpersonal relationship.",
        "SONG STRUCTURE: Structural repetitions are characteristic of song texts.",
        "We search for repetitive structures, i.e., identical or similar multi-line blocks that re-occur, typically but not always representing the chorus.",
        "We use heuristics to align such structures, allowing for fuzzy matches.",
        "An example of a song text 17 with a repeated structure is provided in Figure 1, where lines 56-60 are aligned to lines 61-65.",
        "It can be seen that corresponding lines are not lexically identical but only structurally and lexically similar.",
        "To be able to recognise such cases, we compute the overall similarity between two lines as a weighted sum of their lexical and structural similarities which are modelled in terms of word and POS tag bigram overlaps, respectively.",
        "Using this information and a set of heuristics, it is then determined whether a song contains a chorus and whether the title appears in the song text.",

        "Lyrics also contribute to whether a song is viewed as ?good?",
        "or ?bad?.",
        "A study by Cunningham et al. (2005) also indicates that the lyrics are an important factor for disliking a song and Salley (2011) provides examples of how (text-)stylistic devices such as alliteration can make a song more engaging and therefore more successful.",
        "Finally, Hirjee and Brown (2010) show, for Rap, that the dominant style of song texts can change over time.",
        "In all experiments, we compared our baseline feature set (topK) against the extended set (extended) and a combined set (combined).",
        "As the class distribution in our data is severely skewed, we performed random undersampling to create balanced sets for all experiments and thus avoid problems commonly associated with learning from imbalanced data (He and Garcia, 2009).",
        "The sampled data sets were split into 75% for training and 25% for testing.",
        "The exact numbers depend on the experiment (see Table 2).",

        "Table 3 shows the results per genre and averaged over all genres, as well as the standard deviations.",
        "The n-gram model (topK) outperforms the extended model on all genres except Country but a combination of both models consistently yields even better results with an overall average F-Score of 52.5%.",
        "All F-Score differences between the three models are statistically significant at p < 0.01.",
        "18 The fact that the combined model performs best indicates that the two basic models are at least partially complementary.",
        "The n-gram model hones in on the topic of a text, while the extended model captures more abstract structural and stylistic properties.",
        "However, both perform similarly on individual genres, i.e., they both in themselves capture important aspects of ?genre?.",
        "Looking at the individual genres, Rap seems to be most easily detectable on the basis of the lyrics alone (77.6% F-Score, combined).",
        "This is not surprising, since Rap lyrics have properties that are quite unique, such as complex rhyme structures, long lyrics and a fairly distinctive vocabulary.",
        "Folk seems to be the most difficult genre (29.6% F-Score, combined).",
        "A look at the confusion matrix revealed that Folk was frequently confused with Blues or Country.",
        "All share similar topics (e.g., love, traveling) and are also structurally and stylistically similar.",
        "They are mainly distinguished by musical properties (instrumentation, rhythm etc.).",
        "Lyrical similarities and differences are also revealed by looking at the top 100 unigrams for each genre (Figures 3 to 10).",
        "It can be seen that some genres stand out lexically, for example Rap (dominant slang use), Reggae (Jamaican slang, Rastafarian terms), Religious (religious terms) and Metal (death, violence).",

        "However, unlike in the previous experiment, the extended model now outperforms the topK on two genres (Pop/Rock and Metal).",
        "This suggests that, at least for these two genres, the simple word n-grams are not sufficient to distinguish good and not so good songs; other features, contribute as well.",
        "Rap is the odd-one-out here: For this genre, the quality of a song seems to lie largely in the words and phrases used.",

        "Generally, it seems to hold for all three genres that the best songs are characterised by a higher type-token ratio, fewer interjections and nonsense words (?lalala?",

        "We controlled both for genre and musical quality and trained classifiers to separate the song texts according to their age.",
        "We chose Pop/Rock since we have the most material for this genre and defined three time groups in such a way that we have sufficient data for each of them: New contains songs published since 2008, mid-age songs published between 1998 and 2001, and old songs published before 1988.",
        "We intentionally left gaps between the three classes since the boundaries are somewhat arbitrary and we assume that a song published in, say, 2008 will not per se differ substantially from one published in 2007.",
        "Table 5 shows the results.",
        "Regarding the performance of the different models, we see a similar trend as in the previous experiments: the combined model performs best, the n-gram model performs slightly better than the extended model but there is not much between them.",

        "It seems that, while the publication date of a song can at least partially be determined on the basis of the lyrics, only songs which are published 20 years and more apart can be distinguished relatively well.",
        "In a way this is not so surprising; we would expect the musical style to change over shorter times spans reflecting for example changes in taste regarding instrumentation and recording technology (live drums vs. drum computers, use of auto-tune effects etc.",

        "This is in line with the fact that the duration of songs increased over time.",
        "Older songs also contain more repetitive structures, more exact matches between text blocks and have a higher chance of containing a chorus.",

        "The latter two are novel, as far as we know.",
        "Our study was partly exploratory and we experimented with different feature types, comparing simple n-gram models to more sophisticated approaches.",

        "Both models were tested in isolation and combined on all three tasks.",
        "We found that an n-gram model is often a good first approximation for all of the tasks, however extending the feature space with more sophisticated features nearly always significantly improves the results.",
        "We believe that lyrics-based song classification has potential benefits not only for applications such as music retrieval and recommendation but also for basic musicology research by enabling researchers to mine lyrics corpora for interesting trends.",
        "Lyrics-based music mining is still in its infancy and would benefit from the development of more sophisticated methods for cleaning, processing and analysing song texts.",
        "This applies both to the adaptation of standard NLP tools to this domain and to the further development of stylometric techniques dedicated to analysing lyrics.",
