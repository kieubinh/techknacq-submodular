        "Those labeled sentences composed of unambiguous connectives will be sampled from the reference corpus for training an implicit discourse relation recognition system.",
        "Furthermore, how to employ the learned probability distributions to deal with discourse units containing multiple connectives will be investigated.",
        "In the future, we will tell out the discourse connective and non-discourse connective uses of words and explore their interpretations on the discourse relation recognition.",
        "Besides, we will make use of the probability distributions to the relation labeling on more than two clauses and further extend the methodology to experiments at the inter-sentence level.",
