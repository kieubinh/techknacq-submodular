        "Due to the advent of the internet, the world wide web, social media, the electronic distribution of information and new means of communication, the amount of text available in many different languages is rising.",
        "Natural language processing (NLP) is in charge of automatic processing this growing data.",
        "NLP research has mainly focused on English and very few other languages.",
        "Therefore there is a rich set of annotated corpora for linguistic analysis tasks for these languages.",
        "However, there are no such corpora for thousands of other languages.",
        "Since unsupervised methods do not require annotated data for learning a model, employing unsupervised methods has become a popular and important area of research in NLP.",
        "In this paper, we propose a new precision oriented method for unsupervised coreference resolution.",
        "Our method evaluates the candidate entities of mentions based on the most precise relation of each mention and its candidate entity.",
        "Though we develop and evaluate our method for the English language, we intend to apply it to low resource languages in the future.",
        "Common coreference resolution approaches rely on a combination of different features for each decision (for an overview over such approaches, see Ng (2010)).",
        "However, a few approaches break down this combination having precision in mind (Baldwin, 1997; Zhou and Su, 2004; Haghighi and Klein, 2009; Lee et al., 2013).",
        "The idea of starting with high precision knowledge is used in various NLP tasks including parsing (Borghesi and Favareto, 1982), word alignment (Brown et al., 1993), and named entity classification (Collins and Singer, 1999) with different names like ?islands of reliability?, ?stepping stones?, and ?cautiousness?.",
        "Lee et al. (2013) is a successful recent work that implements this idea as ?sieve architecture?.",
        "Lee et al. (2013) first decide on the basis of more precise features, and then they extend these decisions by using less precise features in later sieves.",
        "In this system less precise knowledge is used for extending the decisions made by high precision knowledge.",
        "Our proposed inference method goes in the same direction but in a different way.",
        "The probability of each coreference decision is computed based on a single relation of a mention-entity.",
        "This single relation is the most precise relation that exist between the mention-entity.",
        "In contrast to Lee et al. (2013), our inference method will never take into account less precise relations if more precise ones are present.",
        "The relative precision of relations can be determined based on our linguistic intuition.",
        "If we would rely on linguistic intuition, our system would look much like Lee et al.'s (2013)'s system, except that it processes This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "644 all mentions in a single sieve, instead of iterating over all mentions for each input relation.",
        "However, it is not a trivial task to determine the relative importance of relations for each new relation, new domain, or new language.",
        "In this regard, we propose an informativeness score for automatically determining the relative precision of relations.",
        "The informativeness score is computed based on the distinguishing power of relations among coreferring and non-coreferring mentions.",
        "We learn the informativeness score in an unsupervised way via few iterations of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm.",
        "Overall, our inference method first finds the most precise relation that a mention has with its candidate entity based on the computed informativeness scores.",
        "It then computes the probability of joining the mention to the entity based on this best relation and its distribution among all candidate entities.",
        "We empirically validate our approach on the OntoNotes and ACE data sets, showing that despite being entirely unsupervised, our system performs well on all benchmark data sets.",
        "2 Related Work Early coreference resolution systems were mainly rule-based systems (Lappin and Leass, 1994; Bald-win, 1997).",
        "The success of statistical approaches in different NLP tasks together with the availability of coreference annotated corpora (like MUC-6 (Chinchor and Sundheim, 2003) and MUC-7 (Chinchor, 2001)) facilitated a shift from deploying rule-based methods to machine learning approaches in coreference research in the 1990s.",
        "The increasing importance of multilingual processing, brought the deployment of semi-supervised and unsupervised methods into attention for automatic processing of limited resource languages.",
        "There are several works which treat coreference resolution as an unsupervised problem (Cardie and Wagstaff, 1999; Angheluta et al., 2004; Haghighi and Klein, 2007; Ng, 2008; Poon and Domingos, 2008; Haghighi and Klein, 2009; Haghighi and Klein, 2010; Kobdani et al., 2011).",
        "We compare our results with the unsupervised systems of Haghighi and Klein (2007), Poon and Domingos (2008), Haghighi and Klein (2009), and Kobdani et al. (2011).",
        "The Haghighi and Klein (2010) approach is an almost unsupervised approach, and we do not include this system in our comparisons.",
        "We use the expectation maximization algorithm for unsupervised learning.",
        "EM has been previously used for coreference resolution (Cherry and Bergsma, 2005; Ng, 2008; Charniak and Elsner, 2009).",
        "Cherry and Bergsma (2005) and Charniak and Elsner (2009) use EM for pronoun resolution, and Ng (2008) models coreference resolution as EM clustering.",
        "The model parameters of Ng (2008) are of the form P (f 1 , .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", f k |C ij ), where f i is a feature, and C ij corresponds to the coreference decision of two mentionsm i andm j .",
        "These parameters along with the entity set, are two sets of unknown variables in Ng (2008).",
        "He computes the posterior probabilities of entities in the E-step, and determines the parameters from the N-best clustering (i.e. estimated entities) in the M-step.",
        "Ng (2008) starts from an initial guess about the entities and determines the parameters based on this initial guess (M-step).",
        "In order to compute the N-best clustering, Ng (2008) uses the Bell tree approach of Luo et al. (2004).",
        "The informativeness scores of mention pair relations (Section 3.2.1) are our unknown parameters.",
        "Our inference method only requires the ranking of the informativeness scores (and not their exact val-ues).",
        "Therefore, it is much easier to estimate the ranking of these parameters than parameters like P (f 1 , .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", f k |C ij ), and our search space for finding an optimized ranking of the informativeness scores is very small.",
        "Since it is easier to have an initial guess about the ranking of informativeness scores (rather than guessing an initial entity set), we start from an E-step with a random ranking.",
        "In our experiments, EM converges very fast regardless of the initial state.",
        "Indeed, in the M-step, we use our new inference method for computing an estimation of entities.",
        "The use of the EM algorithm in our approach is discussed in more detail in Section 3.3.",
        "3 Method Description Our coreference resolution method is a mention-entity approach which works at mention-mention granularity for processing candidate entities.",
        "It estimates entities incrementally while processing the mentions.",
        "645 For resolving each mention, our inference method scores all candidate entities.",
        "For scoring each candidate entity, it first finds the most informative mention-mention relation that exists between the mention and the candidate entity.",
        "It then computes the probability of joining the mention to the entity (i.e. the score of the candidate entity) based on the distribution of this relation among all candidate entities of the mention.",
        "In order to find the best mention-mention relation of a mention and an entity, we introduce an informativeness score that scores mention pair relations based on their association with coreference links.",
        "This measure is a global measure, and it is computed based on the association analysis of the mention pair relations and coreference links on a whole entity set of all input documents.",
        "We learn the informativeness score in an unsupervised way by using the EM algorithm.",
        "Inference is performed at each E-step of the EM iterations.",
        "At each E-step, the whole set of entities is constructed from scratch.",
        "The informativeness score of the input relations is computed in the M-step based on the estimated entities of the E-step.",

        "to the desired threshold value obtained from the ?",
        "2 table (15.0 in our experiments) and removing the relations that are not significant at the desired level.",
        "Similar to Dunning (1993), the test statistics can be used as a measure for scoring.",
        "In our formulation, the test statistics scores given mention pair relations based on their association with coreference links in a way that more precise relations (relations that indicate a coreference link more strongly) will get a 647 higher score, and less precise relations (relations that are randomly spread among coreferring and non-coreferring mentions) will get a lower score.",
        "The formulation of the log-likelihood ratio in Dunning (1993) is a two-tailed statistical test that if p 1 and p 2 significantly diverge from each other, the?2 log ?would get a high value.",
        "However, as mentioned above, we are just interested in the cases that p 1 is much higher than p 2 , because, otherwise, coreference links among the mentions which have the relation r in common are less frequent than expected.",
        "Therefore, we use the one-sidedness condition as discussed by Kiss and Strunk (2006) for the log-likelihood test.",
        "In this case, a relation r is selected as an informative relation for coreference resolution when the ?2 log ?",

        "In order to have a domain-or genre-specific model, one should learn different {IS(r)} for each different domain/genre.",
        "The domain/genre adaptation is discussed in more detail in the discussion part.",

        "We can see that these two steps (i.e. determining entities and the informativeness scores), correspond to the E- and M-steps of the expectation maximization algorithm, respectively.",
        "Expectation maximization is an iterative procedure for computing the maximum likelihood estimator of a parameter set when only a subset of data is available.",

        "In our modeling, the informativeness scores are the unknown parameters, the observed data is a set of relations corresponding to R, and entities are hidden variables.",
        "In the M-step, the model estimates {IS(r)} by using the association analysis of mention pair relations and coreference links over the entire entity set of the input documents.",
        "In the E-step, the algorithm performs the inference method of Section 3.2 and reconstructs the whole set of entities based on the given {IS(r)} values.",
        "As mentioned before, the inference method only needs the ranking of the informativeness scores, and therefore different values of {IS(r)} with similar ordering will lead to the same result.",
        "Our model starts from an initial E-step, in which the values of {IS(r)} are ranked randomly.",
        "The iteration between the E- and M-steps continues until {IS(r)} converges to steady values.",

        "We try different initial states for the EM algorithm, from an informative ranking based on linguistic intuition about the precision of input relations to a misleading ranking (the informative order reversed).",
        "However, in all cases, the EM algorithm leads to the same ranking (as listed in Table 3).",
        "This indicates the robustness of our modeling.",
        "It is more likely that a more precise relation will also get a higher value for its corresponding join probability of Equation 3, because it is unlikely that a precise relation connects a mention to several candidate entities.",
        "However, relations with low precision may connect a mention to several different entities, because they are spread over more different entities than relations with higher precision.",
        "In our experiments, for all tested initial states, the model converges in 4 iterations on the OntoNotes data sets and 5 iterations on the ACE data sets.",
        "5.4 Promising Alternative for the Stanford System Our coreference resolution method is a self-contained approach, that does not need any external linguistic knowledge regarding the coreference relations.",
        "However, we can also consider a simple variant of this system in which a predefined ordering of features (based on linguistic intuition) is given, like the Stanford system.",
        "In this case, the EM algorithm will be no longer needed, and therefore, the algorithm resolves all mentions in a single iteration.",
        "Therefore, this variant of our system can be considered as an efficient alternative to the Stanford system, that uses a simpler (pairwise instead of entity-based) and smaller (5 instead of 7 string matches) set of relations, and more importantly processes all mentions in a single iteration (instead of iterating over all mentions for each relation), and it still performs as well as its entity-based multi-sieve variant.",
        "6 Conclusions In this paper, we presented a new unsupervised coreference resolution method.",
        "We deploy a new precision-oriented inference method that decides about joining a mention to a candidate entity based on only the most informative mention pair relation that exists between the given mention entity pair.",
        "In order to determine the most informative relation of a mention and its candidate entity, we introduce an informativeness score for scoring mention-mention relations based on their global association with 652 coreference links.",
        "A relation whose existence strongly indicates a coreference link will get a high score, and a relation which is randomly spread among coreferring and non-coreferring mentions will get a low score.",
        "The informativeness score is robustly learned during a very few iterations of the EM algorithm.",
        "Our proposed method performs well on all benchmark data sets.",
        "In the future we intend to apply this robust and efficient approach to new genres, domains, and also new languages.",
