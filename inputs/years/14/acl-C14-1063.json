        "Topic modelling has been popularly used to discover latent topics from text documents.",
        "Most existing models work on individual words.",
        "That is, they treat each topic as a distribution over words.",
        "However, using only individual words has several shortcomings.",
        "First, it increases the co-occurrences of words which may be incorrect because a phrase with two words is not equivalent to two separate words.",
        "These extra and often incorrect co-occurrences result in poorer output topics.",
        "A multi-word phrase should be treated as one term by itself.",
        "Second, individual words are often difficult to use in practice because the meaning of a word in a phrase and the meaning of a word in isolation can be quite different.",
        "Third, topics as a list of individual words are also difficult to understand by users who are not domain experts and do not have any knowledge of topic models.",
        "In this paper, we aim to solve these problems by considering phrases in their natural form.",
        "One simple way to include phrases in topic modelling is to treat each phrase as a single term.",
        "However, this method is not ideal because the meaning of a phrase is often related to its composite words.",

        "Topic models such as LDA (Blei et al., 2003) and pSLA (Hofmann 1999) and their extensions have been popularly used to find topics in text documents.",
        "These models are mostly governed by the phenomenon called ?higher-order co-occurrence?",
        "(Heinrich 2009), i.e., how often terms co-occur in different contexts.",
        "Word w1 co-occurring with word w2 which in turn co-occurs with word w3 denotes a second-order co-occurrence between w1 and w3.",
        "Almost all these models regard each topic as a distribution over words.",
        "The words under each topic are often sorted according to their associated probabilities.",
        "Those top ranked words are used to represent the topic.",
        "However, this representation of topics as a list of individual words has some 1major shortcomings: ?",
        "Topics are often difficult to understand or interpret by users unless they are domain experts and also knowledgeable about topic models.",
        "In most real-life situations, these are not the case.",
        "In some of our applications, we show users several good topics, but they have no idea what they are because many domain phrases cannot be split to individual words.",
        "For example, ?battery?",
        "and ?life?",
        "are put under the same topic, which is not bad.",
        "But the users wondered why ?battery?",
        "and ?life?",
        "are the same because they thought words under a topic should somehow have similar meanings.",
        "We had to explain that it is due to ?battery life.?",
        "As another example, sentences such as ?This hotel has a very nice sandy beach?",
        "may cause a topic model to put ?hotel?",
        "and ?sandy?",
        "in a topic, which is not wrong but again it is hard to understand by a user who may not be able to connect the two words.",
        "Thus in order to interpret topics well, the user must know the phrases (they are split into individual words) that may ",
        "667 be used in a domain and how words may be associated with each other.",
        "To make the matters worse, in most cases, the topics generated from a topic model are not perfect.",
        "There are some wrong words under a topic, which make the interpretation even harder.",
        "?",
        "Individual words are difficult to use in practice because in some cases a word under a topic may not have its intended meaning for the topic in a particular sentence context.",
        "This can cause many mistakes.",
        "For example, in sentiment analysis of product reviews, a topic is often regarded as a set of words indicating a product feature or attribute.",
        "This is not true in many cases.",
        "For example, if ?bat- tery?",
        "and ?life?",
        "are put in one topic, when the system sees ?life,?",
        "it assumes it is related to ?battery.?",
        "But in the sentence ?The life expectancy of the machine is about 2 years,?",
        "this ?life?",
        "has nothing to do with battery or battery life.",
        "This causes an error.",
        "If the system can directly use phrases, ?battery life?",
        "and ?life expectancy,?",
        "the error will not occur.",
        "?",
        "Splitting phrases into multiple individual words causes extra co-occurrences that may result in poor or wrong topics involving other words.",
        "For example, due to sentences like ?Beach staffs are rude?",
        "and ?The hotel has a nice sandy beach,?",
        "a topic model may put ?staff?",
        "and ?sandy?",
        "under a topic for staff and/or put ?beach?",
        "and ?rude?",
        "together under the topic of beach views.",
        "Based on our experiences in opinion mining and social media mining, these are major issues with topic models.",
        "We believe that they must be dealt with before wide spread adaptation of topic models in real-life applications.",
        "In this paper, we make an attempt to solve this problem.",
        "We will use term to represent both word and phrase, and use word or phrase when we want to distinguish them.",
        "One obvious way to consider phrases is to use a natural language parser to find all phrases and then treat each phrase as one term, e.g., ?battery life,?",
        "?sandy beach?",
        "and ?beach staff.?",
        "However, the problem with this approach is that it may lose the connection of many related words or phrases in a topic.",
        "For example, under the topic for beach, we may not find ?sandy beach?",
        "because there is no co-occurrence of ?sandy beach?",
        "and ?beach?",
        "if we treat ?sandy beach?",
        "as a single term.",
        "This is clearly not a good solution as it may miss a lot of topical terms (words or phrases) for a topic.",
        "It can also result in poor topics due to the loss of co-occurrences.",
        "Another obvious solution is to use individual words as they are, but add an extra term representing the phrase.",
        "For example, we can turn the sentence ?This hotel has a nice sandy beach?",
        "to ?This hotel has a nice sandy beach <sandy beach>.?",
        "This solution helps deal with the problem of losing co-occurrences to some extent, but because the words are still treated individually, the three problems discussed above still exist, although the phrase ?sandy beach?",
        "now can show up in some topics.",
        "However, due to the fact that phrases are obviously less frequent than individual words, they may be ranked very low, which make little difference to solving the three problems.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to solve the problem, which is based on the generalized P?lya urn (GPU) model (Mahmoud 2008).",
        "GPU was first introduced into LDA in (Mimno et al., 2011) to concentrate words with high co-document frequency.",
        "However, Mimno et al. (2011) and other researchers Chen et al., (2013) still use them in the framework of individual words.",
        "In the GPU model, we can deal with the problems above by treating phrases as individual terms and allowing their component words to have some connections or co-occurrences with them.",
        "Furthermore, we can push phrases up in a topic as phrases are important for understanding but are usually less frequent than individual words and ranked low in a topic.",
        "The intuition here is that when we see a phrase, we also see a small fraction of their component words; and when we see each individual word, we also see a small fraction of its related phrases.",
        "Further, in a phrase not all words are equally important.",
        "For example, in ?hotel staff?, ?staff?",
        "is more important as it is the head noun, which represents the semantic category of the phrase.",
        "Our experiments are conducted using online review collections from 32 domains.",
        "We will see that the proposed method produces significantly better results both quantitatively based on the statistical measure of topic coherence and qualitatively based on human labeling of topics and topical terms.",
        "In summary, this paper makes the following contributions: 1.",
        "It proposes to consider phrases in topic models, which as we have explained above, is important for accurate topic generation, the use of the resulting topics and human interpretation.",
        "As we will see in Section 2, although some prior works exist, they are based on n-grams (Mukherjee and Liu, 2013).",
        "They are different from our approach.",
        "N-grams can generate many non-understandable phrases.",
        "Furthermore, due to infrequency of n-grams (much less frequent than individual words), 668 typically a huge amount of data is needed in order to produce reasonable topics, which many applications simply do not have.",
        "2.",
        "It proposes to use the generalized P?lya Urn (GPU) model to deal with the problems arising in considering phrases.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, the GPU model has not been used in the context of phrases.",
        "This model not only generates better topics, but also rank phrases relatively high in their topics, which greatly helps understanding of the generated topics.",
        "3.",
        "Comprehensive experiments conducted using product and service review collections from 32 domains demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",
        "2 Related Work GPU was first introduced to topic modelling in (Mimno et al., 2011), in which GPU is used to concentrate words with high co-document frequency based on corpus-specific co-occurrence statistics.",
        "Chen et al. (2013) applied GPU to deal with the adverse effect of using prior domain knowledge in topic modeling by increasing the counts of rare words in the knowledge sets.",
        "However, these works still use only individual words.",
        "Topics in most topic models like LDA are unigram distributions over words and assume words to be exchangeable at the word level.",
        "However, there exists some work that tries to take word order into consideration by including n-gram language models.",
        "Wallach (2006) proposed the Bigram Topic Model (BTM) which integrates bigram statistics with topic-based approaches to document modeling.",
        "Wang et al. (2007) proposed the Topical N-gram Model (TNG), which is a generalization of the BTM.",
        "It generates words in their textual order by first sampling a topic, then sampling its status as a unigram or bigram, and then sampling the word from a topic-specific unigram or bigram distribution.",
        "Although the ?bag-of-words?",
        "assumption does not always hold in real-life applications, it offers a great computational advantage over more complex models taking word order into account for discovering significant n-grams.",
        "Our approach is different from these works in two ways.",
        "First, we still follow the ?bag-of-words?",
        "or rather ?bag-of-terms?",
        "assumption.",
        "Second, we find actual phrases rather than just n-grams.",
        "Most n-grams are still hard to understand because they are not natural phrases.",
        "Blei and Lafferty (2009), Liu et al. (2010) and Zhao et al. (2011) also try to extract keyphrases from texts.",
        "Their methods, however, are very different because they identify multi-word phrases using relevance and likelihood scores in the post-processing step based on the discovered topical unigrams.",
        "Mukherjee and Liu (2013) and Mukherjee et al. (2013) all try to include n-grams to enhance the expressiveness of their models while preserving the advantages of ?bag-of-words?",
        "assumption, which has a similar idea as our paper.",
        "However, as we point out in the introduction, this way of including phrases/n-grams suffers from several shortcomings.",
        "Solving these problems is the goal of our paper.",
        "Finally, since we use product reviews as our datasets, our work is also related to opinion mining using topic models, e.g. (Mei et al., 2007; Lu and Zhai, 2008; Titov and McDonald, 2008; Zhao et al., 2010; Li et al., 2010; Sauper and Barzilay, 2013; Lin and He, 2009; Jo and Oh, 2011).",
        "However, none of these models uses phrases.",
        "3 Proposed Model We start by briefly reviewing the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "Then we describe the simple P?lya urn (SPU) model, which is embedded in LDA.",
        "After that, we present the generalized P?lya urn (GPU) model and discuss how it can be applied to our context.",
        "The proposed model uses GPU for its inference.",
        "It shares the same graphical model as LDA.",
        "However, the GPU inference mechanism is very different from that of LDA, which cannot be reflected in the graphical model or the generative process as it only helps to infer more desirable posterior distributions of topic models.",
        "3.1 Latent Dirichlet Allocation LDA is a generative probabilistic model for a document collection.",
        "It assumes that documents are represented as a mixture of latent topics, and each latent topic is characterized by a distribution over terms.",
        "In order to generate a term ??",

        "and ?, Gibbs sampling is used to approximate them based on the posterior estimates of latent topic assignment ?.",

        "Unlike SPU, GPU sampling not only allows us to see a ball of the same color again with higher proba-bility, but also increases the probability of seeing balls with certain other colors.",
        "These additional balls of certain other colors added to the urn increase their proportions in the urn.",
        "We call this the promotion of these colored balls.",

        "We empirically set the number of topics to 15.",

        "When we sample a topic for a word, we add virtualcount of topic assignment to all its related phrases.",

        "For example, in phrase ?hotel staff?, ?staff?",
        "is more important, and we call such words the head nouns.",
        "In this work, we apply a simple method used in (Wang et al., 2007), which is to always assume that the last word in a noun phrase is the head noun.",
        "Although we are aware of the potential harm to our model when we promote a wrong word, we will leave it as our future work.",
        "Again, because we want to connect phrases with their component words and promote the rank of phrases in their topics, we add less virtual counts to individual words.",
        "Thus, we add 0.5 * virtualcount to the last word in a phrase and add 0.25 * virtualcount to all other words.",
        "We set virtualcount = 0.1 in our experiments empirically.",
        "Based on the discovered topics, we conduct statistical evaluation using topic coherence, human evaluation and also a case study to quantitatively and qualitatively show the superiority of the proposed method in terms of both interpretability and topic wellness.",

        "However, researchers have found that perplexity on held-out documents is not always a good predictor of human judgments of topics (Chang et al., 2009).",
        "In our application, we are not concerned with the test on future data using the hold-out set.",
