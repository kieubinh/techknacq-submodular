        "With the rapid growth of social media, about 72% of adult internet users are also members of a social networking site 1 .",
        "Over the past few years, microblogging has become one of the most popular services.",
        "Meanwhile, microblogs have also been widely used as sources for analyzing public opinions (Bermingham and Smeaton, 2010; Jiang et al., 2011), prediction (Asur and Huberman, 2010; Bollen et al., 2011), reputation management (Pang and Lee, 2008; Otsuka et al., 2012), and many other applications (Bian et al., 2008; Sakaki et al., 2010; Becker et al., 2010; Guy et al., 2010; Lee and Croft, 2013; Guy et al., 2013).",
        "For most of these applications, identifying the microblogs that are relevant to the targets of interest is one of the basic steps (Lin and He, 2009; Amig?o et al., 2010; Qiu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2013).",
        "Let us firstly consider the following example: Example 1: 11?",
        "MacBook Air can run for up to five hours on a single charge.",
        "?MacBook Air?",
        "can be considered to be the target being discussed on the microblog, and we can also infer from the microblog that it is related to Apple Inc.",
        "The ability to discriminate which company is being referred to in a microblog is required by many applications.",
        "Previous studies on fine-grained sentiment analysis and aspect-based opinion mining proposed supervised (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Liu et al., 2012a; Liu et al., 2013) and unsupervised methods (Hu and Liu, 2004; Wu et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2010) to extract targets of opinion expressions.",
        "Based on the associations between opinion targets and opinion words, some methods were also introduced to simultaneously solve the opinion expression and target extraction problems (Qiu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2012a).",
        "However, most of the existing methods in this area only focus on extracting items about which opinions are expressed in a given domain.",
        "The implicated information of targets is rarely considered.",
        "Moreover, domain adaptation is another big challenge for these fine-grained methods in processing different domains.",
        "1 It is reported by the Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project in Aug 5, 2013.",
        "688 The WePS-3 2 (Amig?o et al., 2010) and RepLab 2013 3 (Amig?o et al., 2013) evaluation campaigns also addressed the problem from the perspective of the disambiguation of company names in microblogs.",
        "Microblogs that contain company names at a lexical level are classified based on whether it refers to the company or not.",
        "Various approaches have been proposed to address the task with different methods (Pedersen et al., 2006; Yerva et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2012; Spina et al., 2012; Spina et al., 2013).",
        "However, the microblogs that do not contain company names cannot be correctly processed using these methods.",
        "From analyzing the data, we observe that a variety of microblog posts belong to this type.",
        "They only contain products names, slang terms, and other related company content.",
        "To achieve this task, in this paper, we propose the use of a translation based model to identify the targets of microblogs.",
        "We assume that the microblog posts and targets describe the same topic using different languages.",
        "Hence, the target identification problem can be regarded as a translation process from the content of the microblogs to the targets.",
        "We integrate latent topical information into the translation model to facilitate the translation process.",
        "Because product names, series, and other related information are important indicators for this task, we also incorporate this background knowledge into the model.",
        "To evaluate the proposed method, we collect a large number of microblogs and manually annotate a subset of these as golden standards.",
        "We compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art methods using the constructed dataset.",
