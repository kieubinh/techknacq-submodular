        "The distributional hypothesis, articulated by Firth (1957) in the popular dictum ?You shall know the word by the company it keeps?, has established itself as one of the most popular models of modern computational semantics.",
        "With the rise of massive and easily-accessible digital corpora, computation of co-occurrence statistics has enabled researchers in NLP to build distributional semantic models (DSMs) that have found relevance in many application areas.",
        "These include information retrieval (Manning et al., 2008), question answering (Tellex et al., 2003), word-sense disambiguation (McCarthy et al., 2004) and selectional preference modelling (Erk, 2007), to name only a few.",
        "The standard DSM framework, which models the semantics of a word by co-occurrence statistics computed over its neighbouring words, has several known short-comings.",
        "One severe short-coming derives from the fundamental nature of the vector space model, which characterizes the semantics of a word by a single vector in a high dimensional space (or some lower dimensional embedding thereof).",
        "Such a modelling paradigm goes against the grain of the intuition that the semantics of a word is neither unique nor constant.",
        "Rather, it is composed of many facets of meaning, and similarity (or dissimilarity) to other words is an outcome of the aggregate harmony (or dissonance) between the individual facets under consideration.",
        "For example, a shirt may be similar along one facet to a balloon in that they are both coloured blue, at the same time being similar to a shoe along another facet for both being articles of clothing, while being dissimilar along yet another facet to a t-shirt because one is stitched from linen while the other is made from polyester.",
        "Structured distributional semantic models (SDSMs) aim to remedy this fault with DSMs by decomposing distributional signatures over discrete relation dimensions, or facets.",
        "This leads to a representation that characterizes the semantics of a word by a distributional tensor, rather than a vector.",
        "Previous attempts in the literature include the work of Pad?",
        "and Lapata (2007), Baroni and Lenci (2010) and Goyal et al. (2013).",
        "However, all these approaches assume a simplified representation in which truly semantic relations are substituted by syntactic relations obtained from a dependency parser.",
        "698 We believe that there are limiting factors to this approximation.",
        "Most importantly, the set of syntactic relations, while relatively uncontroversial, is unable to capture the full extent of semantic nuance encountered in natural language text.",
        "Often, syntax is ambiguous and leads to multiple semantic interpretations.",
        "Conversely, passivization and dative shift are common examples of semantic invariance in which multiple syntactic realizations are manifested.",
        "Additionally, syntax falls utterly short in explaining more complex phenomena ?",
        "such as the description of buying and selling ?",
        "in which implicit semantics are tacit from complex interactions between multiple participants.",
        "While it is useful to consider relations that draw their origins from semantic roles such as Agent, Patient and Recipient, it remains unclear what this set of semantic roles should be.",
        "This problem is one that has long troubled linguists (Fillmore, 1967; Sowa, 1991), and has been previously noted by researchers in NLP as well (M?rquez et al., 2008).",
        "Proposed solutions range from a small set of generic Agent-like or Patient-like roles in Propbank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) to an effectively open-ended set of highly specific and fine-grained roles in Framenet (Baker et al., 1998).",
        "In addition to the theoretic uncertainty of the set of semantic relations there is the very real problem of the lack of high-performance, robust semantic parsers to annotate corpora.",
        "These issues effectively render the use of pre-defined, linguistically ordained semantic relations intractable for use in SDSM.",
        "In this paper we propose a novel approach to structuring distributional semantic models with latent relations that are automatically discovered from corpora.",
        "This approach effectively solves the conceptual dilemma of selecting the most expressive set of semantic relations.",
        "To the best of our knowledge this is the first paper to propose latent relation dimensions for SDSMs.",
        "The intuition for generating these latent relation dimensions leads to a generic framework, which ?",
        "in this paper ?",
        "is instantiated with embeddings obtained from latent relational analysis (Turney, 2005).",
        "We conduct experiments on three different semantic tasks to evaluate our model.",
        "On a similarity scoring task and another synonym ranking task the model significantly outperforms other distributional semantic models, including a standard window-based model, a syntactic SDSM based on previous approaches proposed in the literature, and a state-of-the-art semantic model trained using recursive neural networks.",
        "On a relation classification task, our model performs competitively, outperforming all but one of the models it is compared against.",
        "2 Related Work Since the distributional hypothesis was first proposed by Firth (1957), a number of different research initiatives have attempted to extend and improve the standard distributional vector space model of semantics.",
        "Insensitivity to the multi-faceted nature of semantics has been one of the focal points of several papers.",
        "Earlier work in this regard is a paper by Turney (2012), who proposes that the semantics of a word is not obtained along a single distributional axis but simultaneously in two different spaces.",
        "He proposes a DSM in which co-occurrence statistics are computed for neighbouring nouns and verbs separately to yield independent domain and function spaces of semantics.",
        "This intuition is taken further by a stance which proposes that a word's semantics is distributionally decomposed over many independent spaces ?",
        "each of which is a unique relation dimension.",
        "Authors who have endorsed this perspective are Erk and Pad?",
        "(2008), Goyal et al. (2013), Reisinger and Mooney (2010) and Baroni and Lenci (2010).",
        "Our work relates to these papers in that we subscribe to the multiple space semantics view.",
        "However, we crucially differ from them by structuring our semantic space with information obtained from latent semantic relations rather than from a syntactic parser.",
        "In this paper the instantiation of the SDSM with latent relation dimensions is obtained using LRA (Turney, 2005), which is an extension of LSA (Deerwester et al., 1990) to induce relational embeddings for pairs of words.",
        "From a modelling perspective, SDSMs characterize the semantics of a word by a distributional tensor.",
        "Other notable papers on tensor based semantics or semantics of compositional structures are the simple additive and multiplicative models of Mitchell and Lapata (2009), the matrix-vector neural network approach of Socher et al. (2012), the physics inspired quantum view of semantic composition of Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh (2011) and the tensor-factorization model of Van de Cruys et al. (2013).",
        "A different, partially overlapping strain of research attempts to induce word embeddings using meth-699 ods from deep learning, yielding state-of-the-art results on a number of different tasks.",
        "Notable research papers on this topic are the ones by Collobert et al. (2011), Turian et al. (2010) and Socher et al. (2010).",
        "Other related work to note is the body of research concerned with semantic relation classification, which is one of our evaluation tasks.",
        "Research community wide efforts in the SemEval-2007 task 4 (Girju et al., 2007), the SemEval-2010 task 8 (Hendrickx et al., 2009) and the SemEval-2012 task 2 (Jurgens et al., 2012) are notable examples.",
        "However, different from our work, most previous attempts at semantic relation classification operate on the basis of feature engineering and contextual cues (Bethard and Martin, 2007).",
        "3 Structured Distributional Semantics and Latent Semantic Relation Induction In this section we formalize the notion of SDSM as an extension of DSM and present a novel SDSM with latent relation dimensions.",

        "This dimension may correspond to another word ?",
        "that may or may not belong to ?",
        "?",
        "or a latent dimension as might be obtained from an SVD projection or an embedding learned via a deep neural network.",
        "Additionally, each element in ~v i is typically a normalized co-occurrence frequency count, a PMI score, or a number obtained from an SVD or RNN transformation.",
        "The semantic similarity between two words w i and w j in a DSM is the vector distance defined by cos(~v i , ~v j ) on their associated distributional vectors.",
        "An SDSM is an extension of DSM.",

        "The n dimensional relational vector ~u il is configurationally the same as a vector ~v i of a DSM.",
        "This definition of an SDSM closely relates to an alternate view of Distributional Memories (DMs) (Baroni and Lenci, 2010) where the semantic space is a third-order tensor, whose modes are Word?",
        "Link?Word.",
        "The semantic similarity between two wordsw i andw j in an SDSM is the similarity function defined by sim( ~ ~u i , ~ ~u j ) on their associated semantic tensors.",
        "We use the following decomposition of the similarity function: sim( ~ ~u i , ~ ~u j ) = 1 d d ?",
        "l=1 cos( ~u il , ~u jl ) (1) Mathematically, this corresponds to the ratio of the normalized Frobenius product of the two matrices representing ~ ~u i and ~ ~u j to the number of rows in both matrices.",
        "Intuitively it is simply the average relation-wise similarity between the two words w i and w j .",
        "3.1 Latent Relation Induction for SDSM The intuition behind our approach for inducing latent relation dimensions revolves around the simple observation that SDSMs, while representing semantics as distributional signatures over relation dimensions, also effectively encode relational vectors between pairs of words.",
        "Our method thus works backwards from this observation ?",

        "?",
        "V , which intuitively embeds the distributional signature of the relation binding the two words in d latent dimensions.",
        "We then construct an SDSM U where ?",
        "U = ?.",
        "For every word w i ?",
        "?",
        "a tensor ~ ~u i ?",
        "R d?k is generated.",
        "The tensor ~ ~u i 700 has d unique k dimensional vectors ~u i1 , ~u i2 , ..., ~u id .",

        "By applying this mapping to generate semantic tensors for every word in ?, we are left with an SDSM U that effectively embeds latent relation dimensions.",

        "Each of these contexts must contain both w i , w j (or appropriate synonyms) and optionally some intervening words, and some words to either side.",
        "Given such contexts, patterns for every word pair are generated by replacing the two target words w i and w j with placeholder characters X and Y , and replacing none, some or all of the other words by their associated part-of-speech tag or a wildcard symbol.",
        "For example, if w i and w j are ?eat?",

        "Figure 1 shows the evaluation results on both semantic tasks as a function of the number of latent dimensions.",
        "The general trend of both curves on the figure indicate that the expressive power of the model quickly increases with the number of dimensions until it peaks in the range of 100?150, and then decreases or evens out after that.",
        "Interestingly, this falls roughly in the range of the 166 frequent (those that appear 50 times or more) frame elements, or fine-grained relations, from FrameNet that O?Hara and Wiebe (2009) find in their taxonomization and mapping of a number of lexical resources that contain semantic relations.",
        "5 Semantic Relation Classification and Analysis of the Latent Structure of Dimensions In this section we conduct experiments on the task of semantic relation classification.",
        "We also perform a more detailed analysis of the induced latent relation dimensions in order to gain insight into our model's perception of semantic relations.",
        "5.1 Semantic Relation Classification In this task, a relational embedding is used as a feature vector to train a classifier for predicting the semantic relation between previously unseen word pairs.",
        "The dataset used in this experiment is from the SemEval-2012 task 2 on measuring the degree of relational similarity (Jurgens et al., 2012), since it characterizes a number of very distinct and interesting semantic relations.",
        "In particular it consists of an aggregated set of 3464 word pairs evidencing 10 kinds of semantic relations.",
        "We prune this set to discard pairs that don't contain words in the vocabularies of the models we consider in our experiments.",
        "This leaves us with a dataset containing 933 word pairs in 9 classes (1 class was discarded altogether because it contained too few instances).",
        "The 9 semantic relation classes are: ?Class Inclusion?, ?Part- Whole?, ?Similar?, ?Contrast?, ?Attribute?, ?Non-Attribute?, ?Case Relation?, ?Cause-Purpose?",
        "and ?Space-Time?.",
        "For example, an instance of a word pair that exemplifies the ?Part-Whole?",
        "relationship is ?engine:car?.",
        "Note that, as with previous experiments, word pairs are given without any context.",
        "5.2 Results We compare LR-SDSM on the semantic relation classification task to several different models.",
        "These include the additive vector composition (AVC) and multiplicative vector composition methods (MVC) proposed by Mitchell and Lapata (2009); we present both DSM and SENNA based variants of these models.",
        "We also compare against the vector difference method of Mikolov et al. (2013) (SENNA- Mik) which sees semantic relations as a meaning preserving vector translation in an RNN embedded vector space.",
        "Finally, we note the performance of random classification as a baseline, for reference.",
        "We attempted to produce results of a syntactic SDSM on the task; however, the hard constraint imposed by syntactic adjacency meant that effectively all the word pairs in the dataset yielded zero feature vectors.",
        "To avoid overfitting on all 130 original dimensions in our optimal SDSM, and also to render results comparable, we reduce the number of latent relation dimensions of LR-SDSM to 50.",
        "We similarly reduce 704 Figure 2: Correlation distances between semantic relations?",
        "classifier weights.",
        "The plot shows how our latent relations seem to perceive humanly interpretable semantic relations.",
        "Most points are fairly well spaced out, with opposites such as ?Attribute?",
        "and ?Non-Attribute?",
        "as well as ?Similar?",
        "and ?Contrast?",
        "being relatively further apart.",
        "the feature vector dimension of DSM-AVC and DSM-MVC to 50 by feature selection.",
        "The dimensions of SENNA-AVC, SENNA-MVC and SENNA-Mik are already 50, and are not reduced further.",
        "For each of the methods we train a logistic regression classifier.",
        "We don't perform any tuning of parameters and set a constant ridge regression value of 0.2, which seemed to yield roughly the best results for all models.",
        "The performance on the semantic relation classification task in terms of averaged precision, recall, F-measure and percentage accuracy using 10-fold cross-validation is given in Table 3.",
        "Additionally, to gain further insight into the LR-SDSM's understanding of semantic relations, we conduct a secondary analysis.",
        "We begin by training 9 one-vs-all logistic regression classifiers for each of the 9 semantic relations under consideration.",
        "Then pairwise correlation distances are measured between all pairs of weight vectors of the 9 models.",
        "Finally, the distance adjacency matrix is projected into 2-d space using multidimensional scaling.",
        "The result of this analysis is presented in Figure 2.",
        "5.3 Discussion Table 3 shows that LR-SDSM performs competitively on the relation classification task and outperforms all but one of the other models.",
        "The performance differences are statistically significant with a p-value < 0.5.",
        "We believe that some of the expressive power of the model is lost by compressing to 50 latent relation dimensions, and that a greater number of dimensions might improve performance.",
        "However, testing a model with a 130-length dense feature vector on a dataset containing 933 instances would likely lead to overfitting and also not be comparable to the SENNA-based models that operate on 50- length feature vectors.",
        "Other points to note from Table 3 are that the AVC variants of the the DSM and SENNA composition models tend to perform better than their MVC counterparts.",
        "Also, SENNA-Mik performs surprisingly poorly.",
        "It is worth noting, however, that Mikolov et al. (2013) report results on fairly simple lexico-syntactic relations between words ?",
        "such as plural forms, possessives and gender ?",
        "while the semantic relations under consideration in the SemEval-2012 dataset are relatively more complex.",
        "In the analysis of the latent structure of dimensions presented in Figure 2, there are few interesting points to note.",
        "To begin with, all the points (with the exception of one pair) are fairly well spaced out.",
        "At 705 the weight vector level, this implies that different latent dimensions need to fire in different combinations to characterize distinct semantic relations, thus resulting in low correlation between their corresponding weight vectors.",
        "This indicates the fact that the latent relation dimensions seem to capture the intuition that each of the classes encodes a distinctly different semantic relation.",
        "The notable exception is ?Space- Time?, which is very close to ?Contrast?.",
        "This is probably due to the fact that distributional models are ineffective at capturing spatio-temporal semantics.",
        "Moreover, it is interesting to note that ?Attribute\" and ?Non-Attribute?",
        "as well as ?Similar?",
        "and ?Contrast?, which are intuitively semantic inverses of each other are also (relatively) distant from each other in the plot.",
        "These general findings indicate an interesting avenue for future research, which involves mapping the empirically learnt latent relations to hand-built semantic lexicons or frameworks.",
        "This could help to validate the empirical models at various levels of linguistic granularity, as well as establish correspondences between different views of semantic representation.",
        "6 Conclusion and Future Work In this paper we have proposed a novel paradigm for SDSMs, that allows for structuring via latent relational information.",
        "We have introduced a generic operational framework that allows for building such SDSMs and outlined an instantiation of the model with LRA.",
        "Experimental results of the model support our claim that the resulting SDSM captures the semantics of words more effectively than a number of other semantic models, and presents a viable ?",
        "and empirically competitive ?",
        "alternative to syntactic SDSMs.",
        "Additionally we have conducted experiments on a relation classification task and shown promising results, as well as performed analyses to investigate the structure of, and interactions between, the latent relation dimensions.",
        "These findings motivate a number of future directions of research.",
        "Since our framework is fairly general we hope to explore techniques other than LRA (such as RNNs) to generate relational embeddings for word pairs.",
        "A desiderata for future techniques is scalability so that we can characterize vocabularies that are larger than the one in our current experiments.",
        "We also hope to explore mappings between our empirically learnt latent relations, and semantic lexicons and frameworks that catalog semantic relations.",
        "Finally, we hope to test our model on more realistic application task such as event coreference, recognizing textual entailment, and semantic parsing in future work.",
