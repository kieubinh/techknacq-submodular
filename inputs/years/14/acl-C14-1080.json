        "We cast this problem into a multi-label text classification task because a psychiatric social text may contain multiple emotion labels.",
        "Additionally, we propose the use of concept-level features to build classifiers instead of using surface-level features such as words, n-grams and dependency structure commonly used in the previous studies (Naughton et al., 2008; Chit-turi and Hansen, 2008; Li and Zong, 2008; Kessler and Sch√ºtze, 2012; Post and Bergsma, 2013; Yu et al., 2011).",
        "In extraction of concept-level features, latent semantic analysis (LSA) (Landauer et al., 1998) has been demonstrated its effectiveness in exploring the latent structure from a collection of documents.",
        "It uses singular value decomposition (SVD) (Golub and Van Loan, 1996) to discover latent features that do not frequently occur in the documents through the indirect associations between words and documents.",

        "Suppose that the words w1, w2 are the useful features for Ei, and w3, w4 are useful for Ej, but w4 is a latent feature because it does not frequently occur in the documents of Ej.",
        "After applying SVD, the latent features can be identified by replacing the zero entries in the original matrix with non-zero real values through the indirect associations between words and documents.",
        "For instance, w4 originally does not occur in d3 and d4, but it does co-occur with w3 in the matrix (e.g., in d5), which means that w4 might also occur in the documents where w3 occurs User Problem: I broke up with my dear but cruel boyfriend recently.",

        "Therefore, the zero entries (w4, d3) and (w4, d4) are replaced with a non-zero value through the indirect associations between of w3 and w4 in d5, as shown in Figure 2(b).",
        "This helps identify a useful latent feature w4 for Ej.",
        "However, identifying latent features through the indirect associations cannot avoid feature overlap when different emotion labels share common words.",
        "For instance, in Figure 2(a), w1, which is useful for Ei, still occurs in the document of Ej (e.g., d4).",
        "Through the indirect associations between of w1 and w3 in d4, the frequency of w1 increases in the document of Ej because it may also occur in the documents where w3 occurs (e.g., d3 and d5), as shown in Figure 2(b).",
        "Therefore, when all word features are to be accommodated in a low-dimensional space reduced by SVD, term overlap may occur between the latent concepts.",
        "As indicated in Figure 2(c), the two sample latent concepts which contribute to two different emotion labels share a common feature w1.",
        "Classifiers trained on such latent vectors with term overlap may decrease classification performance.",
        "To reduce the term overlap among concepts, we used the independent component analysis (ICA) (Lee, 1998; Hyv?rinen et al., 2001; Naik and Kumar, 2011) because it can extract independent components from a mixture of signals and has been used in various text applications (Kolenda and Hansen, 2000; Rapp, 2004; Honkela et al., 2010; Yu and Chien, 2013).",
        "For our task, the psychiatric social texts are a mixture of emotion labels, which can be separated by ICA to obtain a set of independent components (concepts) with minimized term dependency for different emotion labels.",
        "Instead of using ICA alone, we propose a framework combining LSA and ICA for emotion label identification.",
        "The LSA is used to discover latent features that do not frequently occur in psychiatric texts, and ICA is used to further minimize the dependence of the latent features such that overlapped features can be removed, as presented in Figure 2(d).",
        "Based on this combination, the proposed framework can discover more useful latent features for different emotion labels, and the dependence between them can also be minimized.",
        "The discriminant power of classifiers can thus be improved by training them on the independent components with minimized term overlap.",
        "In experiments, we evaluate the proposed method to determine whether the use of concept-level features could improve the classification performance, and determine whether the combination method could improve the performance of using each LSA and ICA alone.",

        "Although the two latent vectors contained useful features for the respective emotion labels, these features still had some overlap between the latent vectors, as marked by the dashed rectangles.",
        "The overlapped features, especially those with higher weights, may reduce the classifier's ability to distinguish between the emotion labels.",
        "The lower part of Fig. 8 also shows two independent components for the emotion labels <Depression> and<Mood>.",
        "As indicated, the term overlap between the two independent components was relatively low.",

        "4 Conclusions This work has presented a framework combining LSA and ICA for emotion label identification.",
        "Both LSA and ICA are used to analyze concept-level features, where LSA is used to discover latent concepts that do not frequently occur in psychiatric texts, and ICA is used to further minimize the term dependence among the concepts.",
        "The experimental results show that the use of concept-level features yielded better performance than the use of word-level features.",
        "Additionally, ICA can reduce the degree of term overlap of LSA so that combining LSA and ICA can discover more useful latent concepts with minimized term dependence for different emotion labels, thus improving classification performance.",
        "Future work will focus on investigating the use of the machine-labeled emotion labels as meta-information to improve online psychiatric services such as information retrieval for self-help knowledge recommendation.",
