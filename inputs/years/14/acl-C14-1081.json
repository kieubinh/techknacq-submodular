        "With the dramatically rapid growth and great success of many large-scale online social networking ser-vices, social media bridge our daily physical life and the virtual Web space.",
        "Popular social media sites (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) and mobile social networks (e.g., Foursquare) have gathered billions of acting users and are still attracting millions of newbies everyday.",
        "Modeling social actions and social ties are two fundamental tasks in online social media.",
        "Social actions are the users?",
        "activities or behaviors in socially connected networks.",
        "For example, a social action can be ?posting a tweet?",
        "on Twitter or the ?check-in?",
        "behavior on Foursquare.",
        "A social tie or social relation is referred to any relationship between two or more individual users in a social network, such as the friend and colleague relationships.",
        "By understanding a user's behaviors and accordingly exploiting potentially interesting services to her/him, one can improve the user's experience and boost the revenue of social media sites.",
        "Also, precise social tie prediction will help people tap into the wisdom of crowds, to aid in making more informed decisions.",
        "Since individual users are socially connected, social influence occurs through information diffusion in social networks.",
        "Social influence happens when one's opinions or behaviors are affected by others.",
        "It is well known that different types of social ties have essentially different influence on social actions.",
        "Intuitively, a user's trusted friends on the web affect that user's online behavior.",
        "Ma et al. (2009) and Ma et al. (2011) claimed that one user's final behavior decision is the balance between his/her own taste and her/his trusted friends?",
        "favors.",
        "On the other hand, social actions also have important influence on social ties.",
        "Obviously, users with similar preferences or behaviors are more likely to be friends than others in social media.",
        "Users with momentous activities will attract many other users to be connected with.",
        "On the contrary, no body will be interested in users with trivial or insignificant behaviors.",
        "Consequently, we face some very interesting questions: Is there any dynamics or mutual influence between social actions and social ties?",
        "To what extent do they influence each other?",
        "A fundamental mechanism that drives the dynamics of networks is the underlying social phenomenon of homophily (McPherson et al., 2001): people tend to follow the behaviors of their friends, and people tend to create relationships with other people who are already similar to them.",
        "This suggests that both actions and ties This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "848 are bi-directionally correlated and mutually influenced in social media, they could be mutually reinforced if modeled jointly.",
        "Inspired by this mechanism, we propose a single unified framework based on exponential-family random graph models ( (Frank and Strauss, 1986), (Wasserman and Pattison, 1996)) to exploit homophily for simultaneous social action prediction and social tie discovery.",

        "behaviors and users?",
        "relations, and defines coupled models to encode both social action and social tie information, to capture dynamics and mutual influence between them.",
        "We propose a gradient based algorithm for learning and optimization.",
        "During the learning procedure, social actions (i.e. user-behavior interactions), social ties (i.e. user-user connections), and deep dependencies and interactions between them could be efficiently explored.",
        "Experimental results demonstrate that social actions and social ties are highly correlated and mutually helpful.",
        "By coupling actions with ties jointly in a single coherent framework, MLRG achieves significantly better performance on both social action prediction and social tie inference, compared to state-of-the-art systems modeling them independently.",
        "2 Related Work Social network analysis has attracted much interest in both academia and industry recently.",
        "Considerable research and engineering has been conducted for social media modeling, analytics and optimization, including social community detection (Fortunato, 2010), user behavior modeling and prediction ( (Ben- evenuto et al., 2009), (Kwak et al., 2010), (Ma et al., 2009), (Ma et al., 2011)), social tie analysis ( (Tang et al., 2011), (Tang et al., 2012)), social sentiment analysis ( (Wasserman et al., 1994), (Pang and Lee, 2008)), etc.",
        "Social action prediction and social tie discovery are two fundamental tasks for social media and social network analysis.",
        "Traditionally, they were considered as separate tasks and solved independently without considering the bidirectional interactions and interdependencies between them.",
        "Social action investigation is essentially important in online social media.",
        "Users behaviors could be affected by various kinds of complex factors, such as users?",
        "attributes, users's historical behaviors, social influence and social network structures.",

        "Aiming at modeling user actions more accurately and realistically, Ma et al. (2009) and Ma et al. (2011) considered connections among users and proposed social trust ensemble to fuse the users?",
        "tastes and their trusted friends?",
        "favors together.",
        "Gao et al. (2013) investigated users?",
        "social behaviors from a spatio-temporal-social aspect in location-based mobile social networks.",
        "In particular, Gao et al. (2013) focused on temporal effects in terms of temporal preferences and temporal correlations, and modeled temporal cyclic patterns to capture a user's mobile behavior to investigate correlations to the spatial context and social context in location-based social networks.",
        "Social tie is the most basic unit to form the network structure.",
        "Tang et al. (2011) proposed a semi-supervised framework, the partially labeled factor graph model to infer the type of social relationships.",
        "The task was formulated as a relationship mining problem to detect the relationship semantics in real-world networks.",
        "Tang et al. (2012) further incorporated social theories and leveraged features based on those social theories to infer social ties across heterogeneous networks via a transfer learning framework.",
        "As can be seen, predicting social actions and inferring social ties were modeled as separate and independent tasks in the above-mentioned approaches, deep interactions and mutual influence between them were not taken into consideration.",
        "In social media users interact with one another to share the content they both create and consume.",
        "According to the homophily phenomenon, exploring bi-directional information and mutual influence between them is intuitively appealing.",
        "We are also aware of several research work attempting to explore joint models to capture mutual benefits and deep dependencies between different tasks in NLP, data mining and information extraction research communities ( (Ko et al., 2007), (Yu and Lam, 2008), (Yu et al., 2009), (Liu et al., 2009), (Yu and Lam, 2010b), (Yu and Lam, 2010a), (Yu et al., 2011), (Yu and Lam, 2012), (Zeng et al., 2013)).",
        "In general, joint models aim to handle multiple hypotheses and uncertainty information and to predict many variables simultaneously such that subtasks can aid each other to boost the performance.",

        "Yu and Lam (2008) proposed an integrated probabilistic and logic approach based on Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) (Richardson and Domingos, 2006) to encyclopedia relation extraction.",

        "This joint model exploits structured variational approximation for tractable parameter learning.",
        "Zeng et al. (2013) presented a semi-supervised graph-based approach to joint Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging.",
        "However, none of these models has been investigated or applied to social media and social network analysis.",
        "We believe that one major reason could be the problem of high computational complexity, such as Yu et al. (2009) and Yu and Lam (2012).",
        "Since many social network sites contain millions of users, exploiting such models could be very challenging.",
        "Currently, research on building joint approaches is still in the infancy stage.",
