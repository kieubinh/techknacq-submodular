        "Microblogging sites such as Twitter and Weibo are evolving into the social platforms of choice for users to express and discuss, in real-time, their thoughts and ideas on a plethora of subject matters.",
        "It is thus important to use these microblog streams to identify the ?buzz?",
        "or ?talking points?",
        "regarding any topic or entity of interest, including organizations, products and social issues.",
        "This has several applications: For businesses, identifying what its customers are mostly talking about allows them to better engage with their customer base (Burton and Soboleva, 2011; Patino et al., 2012), fine-tune brand awareness and marketing campaigns (Popescu and Jain, 2011), and provide real-time feedback about customer preferences and complaints.",
        "Similarly, policy makers and think tanks would benefit from understanding the buzz around various socio-cultural or environmental issues, that could enable them to make well-informed choices and decisions.",
        "Infering such key talking points in social media also enables higher layer social-analytics applications such as trend detection, event tracking, and fine-grained opinion and sentiment analysis.",
        "The goal of this paper is to automatically infer such entity-specific buzz in social media, which we represent using key phrases identified from microblog posts about the entity.",
        "Following past literature (Kobayashi et al., 2007; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012), we call these topical phrases as aspects.",
        "Thus, given a stream of microblog posts about an entity of interest, we devise an algorithm that automatically discovers a ranked list of the top aspects that succinctly represent the buzz or key talking points among users about the entity.",
        "As an illustrating example, Figure 1 shows the top 10 aspects discovered for each month by our aspect discovery algorithm for the Microsoft Surface tablet using 6 month of Twitter data.",
        "For each month we depict the key events and news stories (below the timeline) related to the Surface, along with the set of discovered aspects (above the timeline).",
        "As seen from the figure, several of the top aspects do not reflect product features or attributes, but instead capture the buzz among Twitter users around recent events or news related to the Surface.",
        "For example, the aspects ?surface pricing?",
        "and ?sur- face preorders?",
        "in October refer to the discussions on Twitter following a press release providing details of the Surface pricing and preorder dates.",
        "Similarly, the aspect ?Oprah tweets?",

        "over 6 months (October 2012 to March 2013).",
        "The aspects identified by our algorithm (for each month) is shown above the time line, while key events regarding the product is shown below.",
        "Aspects that directly relate to the events are shown in bold blue, while aspects that have no bearing to the news are shown in italics.",
        "The aspects that were related to an event in previous months but has persisted as an aspect are shown in red using normal font.",
        "to discussions around media coverage of how Oprah Winfrey tweeted a review of the Surface tablet from her iPad.",
        "The aspects ?iFixit?",
        "and ?repairability?",
        "refer to the unveiling of the iFixit repairability report for the Surface in February.",
        "On the other hand, we also see more traditional product feature or attributes that are not correlated to external events but are key discussion points across multiple months, such as ?keyboard?",
        "or ?touch cover?.",
        "While there exists a rich line of work (refer to (Liu, 2012) for a comprehensive survey) in aspect identification from customer reviews, blogs or discussion forums, mostly for fine-grained opinion mining for products, there has been little work in the context of aspect discovery from large scale microblog posts.",
        "Microblogs pose a unique set of challenges that makes it difficult to directly apply existing methods from prior work.",
        "For example, in several papers, frequently occurring noun phrases is used as the building block for detecting aspects (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Hu and Liu, 2004b; Ku et al., 2006).",
        "However, for mi-croblogs, frequency of a noun phrase alone is an insufficient indicator of an aspect, due to the inherent noise (unlike reviews, microblog posts are short and often not as focused) and redundancy (e.g., due to retweeting in the context of Twitter).",
        "Yet another challenge unique to microblog streams is that the brevity of the posts provide inadequate context and structure.",
        "In addition, they are also noisy, with a single tweet often containing both relevant and irrelevant content for a given entity.",
        "Due to these reasons, well-known probabilistic approaches (e.g., Topic Models (Mei et al., 2007; Titov and McDonald, 2008) or Conditional Random Fields (Jakob and Gurevych, 2010)), that work well for aspect identification from reasonably long and syntactically well-formed documents such as reviews and blogs, becomes immediately inappropriate in the microblog setting.",
        "Additionally, the high volume and velocity of social media streams calls for a scalable, fully automated approach that seamlessly works for a variety of entities and requires no domain-specific knowledge.",
        "We address these challenges inherent in aspect discovery from microblog streams in a principled way: we propose quantifiable indicator measures of ?uniqueness?, ?diversity?",
        "and ?burstiness?",
        "based on insights that are fairly intuitive and yet are generic enough to model the characteristics of relevant aspects for a range of diverse entities.",
        "We represent candidate phrases in terms of these three indicators.",
        "We propose a probabilistic model for scoring the candidate phrases (?",
        "2.3) corresponding to an entity of interest.",
        "For every entity, the model automatically clusters the indicators and for each cluster, learns relative importance between the indicators for scoring the candidate aspects.",
        "Given a collection of <candidate aspects, noisy label> pairs where the noisy label reflects if the corresponding candidate is an aspect 861 (albeit, noisly), we use an Expectation-Maximization algorithm for training the model.",
        "We also present an approach to leverage web search engine results (?",
        "2.4) to automatically obtain noisy labelled data for any entity.",
        "While being entity specific, our approach is highly scalable, entity-agnostic and does not require any manual effort.",
        "We validate our results on diverse entities, using all tweets from Twitter corresponding to a three month period from January 2013 to March 2013.",
        "Related Work: To the best of our knowledge, the only works related to aspect discovery from microblog posts are (Spina et al., 2012) and (Zhao et al., 2011).",
        "In (Spina et al., 2012), four information retrieval functions were compared for identifying aspects from a set of tweets about companies.",
        "They showed that a TF-IDF based approach performed the best.",
        "Their experiments were however not performed across multiple domains, and used a very small number of tweets for each company.",
        "Further-more, our ?uniqueness?",
        "based ranking (?",
        "2.2) that we use as one baseline is quite similar to their TF-IDF approach, and in our large scale evaluation over diverse domains, we show that TF-IDF or uniqueness alone is not sufficient for efficient aspect discovery (?",
        "3).",
        "The work by (Zhao et al., 2011) proposes an unsupervised approach for keyphrase ranking based on measures of ?interestingness?",
        "(which is similar to our uniqueness indicator) and ?relevance?.",
        "However, as we show in our experiments (?",
        "3), the performance of this method is entity?dependent and does not naturally scale to all entities.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "We describe our algorithm in ?",
        "2, including the various indicators that we use to characterize an aspect, the automatic label generation, and our probabilistic model.",
        "In ?",
        "3, we present experimental results and evaluation of our algorithm along with other baselines on the three month Twitter data set.",
        "We conclude in ?",
        "4 with remarks on future work.",
        "2 Approach We formulate the problem of identifying aspects as follows: Problem statement: Let e be an entity and s be a time period of interest.",
        "We use T s to denote the set of all tweets in time period s, and T s e ?",
        "T s to be the set of all tweets about e in time period s 1 .",
        "Then, we wish to identify the set of k phrases from T s e which are most likely to be valid aspects of e. Solution overview: Given e, we first identify a set of candidate phrases for aspects from T s e (?2.1).",
        "For each phrase, we compute a global indicator, uniqueness, that measures how strongly the phrase is correlated with e by comparing its occurrence in T s e and T s .",
        "We also compute two local indicators, diversity that measures how diversely the phrase is used in T s e , and burstiness that measures the temporal activity around the phrase usage in T s e (?",
        "2.2).",
        "We train a probability model (?",
        "2.3) that captures non-linear relationships between the indicators using a combination of linear decision surfaces.",
        "The training labels are obtained using a completely automated approach (?",
        "2.4).",
        "The model is trained independently for each entity, and subsequently used in inferring aspects for the entity during the time period of interest.",
        "2.1 Candidate Aspects We expect an aspect of an entity to be a phrase on which users can say something subjective.",
        "This intuitive requirement is enforced by restricting candidate aspects to be noun phrases (Hu and Liu, 2004b; Popescu and Etzioni, 2007) that are qualified with an adjective within short proximity (around four words) in at least one tweet (Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2008).",
        "We use a Twitter-specific part-of-speech tagger (Owoputi et al., 2013) to identify a candidate set of noun phrases in T s e that are used in conjunction with an adjective.",
        "After resolving plural nouns to their singular forms, this results in a few thousand candidate phrases per entity for a month of tweets.",
        "2.2 Indicators We represent a phrase using measurements across three dimensions that captures ?diversity?, ?unique- ness?",
        "?burstiness?",
        "of usage.",
        "These are described in detail below.",
        "1 While accurately classifying microblog posts to extract posts relevant to an entity is a research problem in itself, this is outside the scope of this work.",
        "In this work, we use keyword based classifiers for our entities.",
        "862 2.2.1 Diversity Intuitively, a genuine aspect of an entity is more likely to have been discussed on Twitter in the context of that entity, compared to other noun phrases.",
        "While one can consider a metric like occurrence frequency (e.g., (Liu, 2012)) to capture this intuition, in microblog settings like Twitter, this can overestimate the importance of a phrase because of redundancy of content due to (a) simple retweeting by followers, (b) multiple users posting the same or very similar content, especially when talking about news and events, and (c) same user posting multiple versions of the same tweets due to automated tweet applications.",
        "As an example, the most frequently used noun phrase on Twitter for the entity ?Microsoft Surface?",
        "during March was ?tablet-a-day giveaway?.",
        "However, all the tweets containing this phrase referred to a lottery contest that required users to tweet a pre-specified sentence about the Surface.",
        "Hence, this phrase cannot be considered a relevant aspect.",
        "We propose factoring out such redundancy by using a notion of ?diversity?",
        "of content about that aspect.",
        "To this effect, for each candidate aspect, its ?Diversity?",
        "indicator is obtained by computing a score based on the amount of diverse content in the set of tweets about the aspect.",
        "To efficiently compute this diversity score, we use the Simhash algorithm (Charikar, 2002) based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (Indyk and Motwani, 1998).",
        "Simhash measures the similarity of two tweets t 1 and t 2 by hashing them into small f-bit fingerprints (we use f = 128), and comparing the Hamming distance between them.",
        "The Locality Sensitive Hash function H used by Simhash ensures that Pr[H(t 1 ) = H(t 2 )] = Sim(t 1 , t 2 ), where Sim(t 1 , t 2 ) is the cosine similarity between t 1 and t 2 .",
        "Thus, it suffices to compute a diversity score on the (much smaller) set of 128-bit fingerprints of the tweets containing the aspect.",
        "We define this score as the cardinality of the largest subset S ?",
        "T s e of tweets such that the Hamming distance d between the fingerprints of any pair in S is at most 90% of the fingerprint length.",
        "While this is a combinatorially hard problem, we use a greedy heuristic to approximate this score using the following steps: 1) Initialize S to a random tweet r ?",
        "T s e .",
        "2) At each iteration, let t ?",
        "T s e \\ S maximize D(S, t).",
        "(Here we define D(S, t) = min x?S d(H(x),H(t))).",
        "If D(S, t) > 0.9, add t to S. Else return |S|.",
        "2.2.2 Uniqueness Another property of a relevant aspect for an entity is a notion of ?uniqueness?",
        "to that entity.",
        "Intuitively, an aspect should have a higher propensity of being used in tweets about that entity, compared to a generic set of tweets.",
        "For example, in the case of Microsoft Surface, several commonly used noun-phrases might have a high frequency of occurrence or a high diversity score such as ?news?",
        "or ?store?.",
        "However such phrases are arguably too generic to be considered as an aspect of Microsoft Surface.",
        "Hence we need to evaluate a candidate noun phrase in terms of its frequency in the set of tweets for that entity, versus its frequency across all tweets in the same time window.",
        "In particular, we define the uniqueness indicator of a phrase p in a time period s as: uniqueness s e [p] = ?",
        "t?T s e I[p ?",
        "t] ?",
        "t?T s I[p ?",
        "t] + ?",
        ", (1) where I[p ?",
        "t] is an indicator that evaluates to 1 if the tweet t contains the phrase p, and 0 otherwise.",
        "?",
        "enforces minimal support (?",
        "tweets from T s e ) required for p to be unique.",
        "We used ?",
        "= 10.",
        "Note that this is reminiscent of the tf-idf metric in information retrieval and also used in (Spina et al., 2012); The numerator corresponds to the notion of term-frequency and the denominator to document frequency.",
        "This can also be interpreted probabilistically, by considering a bernoulli variable Z that models how unique the phrase is to e. Then the above definition is similar to a maximum-likelihood estimate of Z using a Beta distribution with ?",
        "as the prior.",
        "2.2.3 Burstiness Another indicator of a relevant aspect of an entity is a noun phrase that has an unexpected surge in its frequency of occurrence among tweets of the entity, in a short period of time.",
        "This could be due to an 863 emerging news story, event or talking point about the entity and hence indicate that the phrase is strongly related to the entity, even if the overall frequency of the phrase over a larger time period might be low.",
        "We capture this notion using the ?burstiness?",
        "indicator.",
        "For each candidate noun-phrase, we create a time-series of its occurrences in tweets of the entity within the specific time window.",
        "We then use the burst model due to Kleinberg (Kleinberg, 2002) to extract a burstiness score for the noun-phrase.",
        "Kleinberg's model uses a finite-state automaton with different states corresponding to different emission frequencies, where state transitions from a low-frequency state to a high-frequency state signify the onset of a burst.",
        "We use an R-implementation (url, 2014) of this algorithm on the time series of occurrences of a noun-phrase to identify the corresponding burst levels, and define the burstiness score of the noun-phrase as the sum of these burst levels.",
        "For example, the aspect ?shipping lanes?",
        "detected by our algorithm for the entity ?Global Warming?",
        "has relatively low frequency of occurrence overall, however it was a topic of intense discussion on Twitter during a week when mainstream news media reported on a PNAS article discussing opening up of new shipping lanes through the Arctic ocean due to global warming(url, 2013).",
        "2.3 Probabilistic model for aspect identification Given a candidate phrase and its measurements of indicators, we would like to rank these based on a learned model that takes into account these varied interactions between the indicators.",
        "One approach is to directly train a linear classifier such as logistic regression using a training set of <phrase,binary label> pairs.",
        "As we show in ?",
        "3, this approach does not capture the non-linear dependencies among the indicators and the label, resulting in poor performance.",
        "In this paper, we jointly model the space of indicator variables and their labels, which we describe next.",
        "2.3.1 Model specification A candidate phrase is represented by a three-dimensional continuous-valued random variable x, where x 1 corresponds to ?Diversity?, x 2 to ?Uniqueness?",
        "and x 3 to?Burstiness?.",
        "The relationship between these indicators is captured by a probabilistic Gaussian mixture model.",
        "Let c be a random variable with discrete distribution over m components.",
        "Then, p(x, c) = p(c)p(x|c) = pi c N (x|?",

        "One can view our formulation as a variant of mixture of experts (Jacobs et al., 1991) wherein the gating functions are represented using the posterior over the mixture model components, as opposed to the soft-max function typically used.",

        "This approach can result in noisy labels since a candidate phrase that have huge web presence may not be an aspect, and vice versa.",
        "In spite of this, we observed reasonable correlation between the propensity of a phrase on Twitter to be a true aspect and the quality of web search result that we can retrieve.",
