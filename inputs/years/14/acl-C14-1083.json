        "Story highlights form a succinct single-document summary consisting of 3-4 highlight sentences that reflect the gist of a news article.",
        "Automatically producing news highlights is very challenging.",
        "We propose a novel method to improve news highlights extraction by using microblogs.",
        "The hypothesis is that microblog posts, although noisy, are not only indicative of important pieces of information in the news story, but also inherently ?short and sweet?",
        "resulting from the artificial compression effect due to the length limit.",
        "Given a news article, we formulate the problem as two rank-then-extract tasks: (1) we find a set of indicative tweets and use them to assist the ranking of news sentences for extraction; (2) we extract top ranked tweets as a substitute of sentence extraction.",

        "People in this era are overloaded by their daily exposure to large amount of online information.",
        "To make life easier, some news websites like CNN.com and USAToday.com provide ?Story Highlights?",
        "in their news articles for readers to get the gist of story quickly.",
        "The highlights of an article typically contain 3-4 summary sentences in bullet-points form that are representative of and shorter than the original new sentences in the article.",
        "An example of story highlights of an article is shown in Figure 1 (marked in red rectangle) that are written in a compact, almost telegraphic style.",
        "In contrast to the original content of the article, significant compression is obtained by shortening and paraphrasing.",
        "Unfortunately, the production of such good-quality highlights needs to be done manually which is very expensive.",
        "Existing methods face grand technical challenges for automating the process.",
        "The task is complex in nature due to a broad range of linguistic constraints which ultimately requires wide-coverage of language understanding beyond the capabilities of current NLP technology (Woodsend and Lapata, 2010).",
        "Most automatic systems simplify the problem using extractive approach.",
        "By using linguistic or statistical information or both, the key units or concepts can be identified from sentences or across multiple documents, and then the sentences are scored and extracted according to their informativeness with the presence of the key components.",
        "The extractive approach has two salient problems: (1) it is commonly ineffective to locate key sen-tences, meaning that the presence of linguistically and/or statistically important units does not necessarily indicate a highlight sentence.",
        "This is evidenced by the fact that sophisticated systems for Document Understanding Conference (DUC) summarization task cannot significantly outperform a trivial baseline that simply selects first n sentences of the document (Nenkova, 2005); (2) sentence extracts as highlights are extraordinarily verbose in general, which need to be post-processed for substantial compression.",
        "But sentence compression may breach the readability or grammaticality (Clarke and Lapata, 2008).",
        "With the popularity of social media, online news providers are moving towards offering more interaction with news readers via microblogging service like Twitter.",
        "Many Twitter users also post tweets Work conducted at Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI) when the first author was employed as an intern This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "872 Figure 1: A CNN news article with story highlights (Highlights are marked by red rectangle, and the news sentences related to the highlights are enclosed in green rectangles) and some relevant tweets one can observe independently on Twitter (marked by light blue rectangles on the left) about news together with their URLs.",
        "Such increased cross-media interaction recasts the role of different information sources that are useful for this task in a sense that interesting correlations between the news and relevant microblogs could be captured and leveraged to boost the performance.",
        "To address these considerations, we make two hypotheses based on our observation that can be crucial to highlights extraction.",
        "(1) Indicative effect: microblog users?",
        "mentioning about the pieces of news is indicative of the importance of the corresponding sentences; (2) Human compression effect: important portions of a news article have been rewritten by microblog users in a more condensed style owing to length limit.",
        "Accordingly, we formulate our problem as two independent rank-then-extract tasks: firstly, we find a set of indicative tweets and use them to assist the ranking of news sentences for extraction; secondly, we extract top-ranked tweets (with the help of news sentences) as a substitute of sentences extraction since they are typically shorter.",
        "Based on our news-tweets pairing corpus, the results of experiments following both directions indicate that our methods outperform some strong baselines for single-document summarization.",
        "2 Related Work Our work intersects the summarization of single document and microblogs.",
        "Single-document summarization has been studied for years starting from Luhn and Peter (1958).",
        "Based on local content information of a document (Wong et al., 2008; Barzilay et al., 1997; Marcu, 1997), researchers proposed various statistical or semantic approaches using classification (Wong et al., 2008), Integer Linear Programming (ILP) (Li et al., 2013), sequential models (Shen et al., 2007) and graphical models (Litvak and Last, 2008; Hirao et al., 2013).",
        "For the concision of summary, sentence compression or word deletion was used (Knight and Marcu, 2002) for preprocessing.",
        "Joint models combining compression and selection of sentences were also studied (Woodsend and Lapata, 2010; Li et al., 2013).",
        "Summarizing microblog content is to distill the large quantities of tweets into a concise and representative description of a target event.",
        "Sharifi et al. (2010) proposed a graph-based phrase reinforcement 873 algorithm (PRA) to generate a one-sentence summary from a collection of tweets.",
        "By using linguistic features, Judd and Kalita (2013) improved the performance of PRA.",
        "Sharifi et al. (2010) and Inouye et al. (2011) presented a hybrid TF-IDF approach for extracting tweets with the presence of important terms.",
        "More fine-grained summarization was proposed by considering sub-events and combining the summaries extracted from each sub-topic (Nichols et al., 2012; Zubiaga et al., 2012; Duan et al., 2012).",
        "The research for coupling news and microblogs attracted much attention recently.",
        "Suba?si?c and Berendt (2011) and Zhao et al. (2011) independently compared tweets to online news to identify features for news detection in tweets.",
        "Phelan et al. (2011) used tweets to recommend news articles based on user preferences.",
        "Gao et al. (2012) produced cross-media news summaries by capturing the complementary information from both sides.",
        "Kothari et al. (2013) and ?",
        "Stajner et al. (2013) investigated detecting news comments from Twitter for extending news information provided.",
        "Guo et al. (2013) proposed a graphical model to identify news for a given tweet to provide contextual support for NLP tasks.",
        "Some work attempted to use different kinds of resources to help document summarization, such as Wikipedia and query log of search engine (Svore et al., 2007), clickthrough data (Sun et al., 2005), users?",
        "comments on news (Hu et al., 2008), and social media context of the articles (Yang et al., 2011).",
        "Our work is closely related to Svore et al. (2007) that considered incorporating third-party resource in the ranking process, but the access to query logs is extremely limited, and Wikipedia content is relatively static which cannot reflect timely information like social media.",
        "We also share the same testbed with Woodsend and Lapata (2010).",
        "They selected and compressed news sentences with a joint model using ILP by considering phrase as basic extract element.",
        "Their method requires a large training corpus for deriving accurate salient scores of phrases, and also the feasible solution of ILP model with hard constraints does not necessarily exist.",
        "Yang et al. (2011) proposed a unified supervised model called dual wing factor graph to simultaneously summarize Web documents and tweets based on structural mining from social context.",
        "Despite of similar motivation, our work has some key differences from theirs: (1) Our ground-truth come from standard news highlights, and our target summary keeps consistent no matter which source of information our highlights are extracted from.",
        "They built ground-truth summaries separately for each side by manually choosing no less than 5 tweets and 10 news sentences.",
        "So, our standard is more difficult to reach since our ground-truth summaries are not extracts of the original sentences or tweets; (2) Our approach is very different.",
        "We use ranking-based algorithm which is more adequate than their classification approach because there are much fewer positive candidates than negative ones, and the class distribution is very imbalanced (like information retrieval tasks).",
        "Also, they were focused on mining the implicit structural information from retweeting and user following networks, while we focus on content-based correlations.",
        "3 Corpus Construction There is no news-tweets coupling data set publicly available for the purpose of news highlights production 1 .",
        "We constructed the first of such corpus for this application by our own, for which an event-oriented strategy was adopted to collect the highlights-document-tweets couplings by using a social search engine.",
        "We manually identified 17 salient news events taking place in recent two years.",
        "For each event, we manually generated a set of core queries which were used to retrieve the relevant tweets via Topsy 2 search API.",
        "Then we gathered the retrieved tweets containing embedded URLs that point to the news articles on CNN and USAToday websites that provide story highlights, and extracted the content of the news articles and the associated highlights.",
        "For each article, we collected all the tweets in the retrieved tweet set above that contain links to the article to form our highlights-document-tweets couplings based on the following rules: (1) We delete those extremely short tweets with less than 5 tokens and the tweets that are suspected copies from news title and highlights.",
        "For example, we try our best to remove all the suspectable tweets including the cases 1 We realize the news-tweets coupling data set released recently for NLP tasks by Guo et al. (Guo et al., 2013).",
        "However, this data set is not suitable for our task for two reasons: (1) There are 12,704 news articles but only 34,888 tweets.",
        "Although part of the news are from CNN which contain story highlights, the number of tweets per article is too limited, not to mention finding useful candidates; (2) The full text of news content is not provided, with only the first few sentences of articles instead.",
        "2 http://topsy.com 874 Documents Highlights Tweets Total # 121 455 78,419 Sentence # per news 53.6?25.6 3.7?0.4 648.1?1161.7 Token # per news 1123.0?495.8 49.6?10.0 10364.5?24749.2 Token # per sentence 21.0?11.6 13.2?3.2 16.0?5.3 Table 1: Overview statistics on the corpus (mean and standard deviation) Event Doc # Highlight # Tweet # Event Doc # Highlight # Tweet # Aurora shooting 14 54 12,463 African runner murder 8 29 9,461 Boston bombing 38 147 21,683 Syria chemical weapons use 1 4 331 Connecticut shooting 13 47 3,021 US military in Syria 2 7 719 Edward Snowden 5 17 1,955 DPRK Nuclear Test 2 8 3,329 Egypt balloon crash 3 12 836 Asiana Airlines Flight 214 11 42 8,353 Hurricane Sandy 4 15 607 Moore Tornado 5 19 1,259 Russian meteor 3 11 6,841 US Flu Season 7 23 6,304 Chinese Computer Attacks 2 8 507 Williams Olefins Explosion 1 4 268 cause of the Super Bowl blackout 2 8 482 Total 121 455 78,419 Table 2: Distribution of documents, highlights and tweets with respect to different events like ?RT @someone HIGHLIGHT URL?",

        "Note that using explicit hyperlinks is not the only way for identifying the couplings but the most straightforward one.",
        "Here we simply resort to this straightforward method to build the corpus for verifying our two hypotheses raised in Section 1.",
        "Thorough investigation on the construction of an enhanced highlights-oriented coupling corpus is left for our future work.",
        "The statistics of the resulted corpus are given in Table 1 which is also made accessible 3 .",
        "As shown in the table, the average number of relevant tweets to a document is about 648.",
        "Since some of the events are much more popular than others, the standard deviation of the number of tweets associated with a document is as high as 1,162.",
        "The highlights are characterized as high compression rate compared to the length of news articles.",
        "In addition, a single highlight sentence on average is only 2/3 the length of a news sentence, and more interestingly the average length of tweets is very close to that of highlight sentences, which suggests that the relevant tweets can be a reasonable source of candidates for extraction.",
        "Table 2 shows the distribution of documents, highlights and tweets with respect to the 17 news events we collected.",
        "4 Our Approach Given a news article containing n sentences S = {s 1 , s 2 , ...s n } and a set of m relevant tweets T = {t 1 , t 2 , ..., t m }, we aim to extract x sentences from the set S or the same number of tweets from set T as highlights covering the main theme of the article.",
        "We define the two tasks as follows: ?",
        "Task 1 ?",
        "sentences extraction: Given auxiliary T , extract x elements H(S) = {s (1) , s (2) , ..., s (x) |s (i) ?",
        "S, 1 ?",
        "i ?",
        "x} from S as highlights.",
        "?",
        "Task 2 ?",
        "tweets extraction: Given auxiliary S, extract x elementsH(T ) = {t (1) , t (2) , ..., t (x) |t (i) ?",
        "T, 1 ?",
        "i ?",
        "x} from T as highlights.",
        "Most single-document summarization methods (Woodsend and Lapata, 2010; Yang et al., 2011) treat the extraction as a classification problem which assigns either positive or negative label to the extract candidates.",
        "We argue that it is more adequate to model it as a ranking problem because there is far more unsuitable candidates than suitable ones for being the highlights.",
        "Such kind of imbalanced class distribution makes classification a secondary solution.",
        "Our model learns to rank all the candidate sentences in task 1 or candidate tweets in task 2, and then extracts the top-x ranked instances as output highlights.",
        "We adopt an effective pair-wise ranking model RankBoost (Freund et al., 2003) for that using the RankLib package 4 .",

        "In our case, instance pair can be the pair of sentences or tweets, and the pairwise order is determined by the salient score of each instance that is the maximum ROUGE-1 (Lin, 2004) F-value between the instance and the corresponding ground-truth highlight sentences.",
        "Given the gold standard highlights H g = {h 1 , h 2 , ..., h x }, the salient score of an instance is calculated as score(I i ) = max k {ROUGE-1(I i , h k )}.",
        "Note that in task 2 the number of tweets pairs generated in training can be extremely large because of the number of tweets in popular topical news articles (see Table 2) that may degrade the efficiency of training.",
        "Some ad-hoc workaround is employed to make the problem tractable.",
        "As opposed to using all the possible pairs, we divide the tweets into b bins, where the bins are bounded by continuous ranges of salient scores.",
        "We fix the length of different ranges by fitting the distributions of salient score values.",
        "Tuned on a subset with 20% randomly selected training instances, the value of b is determined as 4.",
        "Then, the pairs are formed across these brackets.",
        "5 Feature Design The feature space of the two tasks are designed to intersect at the cross-media correlation part.",
        "The local features describe the instance to be ranked (i.e., either a news sentence or a tweet), and the cross-media correlation features capture the similarity of the instance with the counterparts in the auxiliary resource.",
        "The features consist of three subsets of informativeness measures including local sentence features (LSF), local tweet features (LTF) and cross-media correlation features (CCF).",
        "In task 1, we can use LSF or both LSF and CCF for rank learning; and in task 2, we can use LTF or combine LTF and CCF.",
        "The full feature list is described in Table 5.",
        "For local sentence features, we implement the 5 document features defined in (Svore et al., 2007) for single-document summarization task.",
        "This is for the ease of comparison with the existing approach.",
        "In this section, we will only describe the local tweet features and the cross-media correlation features in more detail.",
        "5.1 Local Tweet Features Local tweet features are proposed to capture the importance of a tweet based on local information in three aspects, including twitter-specific, topic-related, and writing-quality measures.",
        "876 5.1.1 Twitter-specific measures Twitter-specific features indicate the basic content-based characteristics of a tweet such as length, the characteristics specifically provided by Twitter platform such as hashtags, mentions and embedded urls, and two scoring functions used by state-of-the-art tweet summarization algorithms including Hybrid TF-IDF (Sharifi et al., 2010) and PRA (Sharifi et al., 2010).",
        "Hybrid TF-IDF is a variant of traditional TF-IDF weighting for tweets collection which treats each tweet as a document when computing IDF while the whole tweets set as a document when computing TF.",
        "We calculate the feature ImportTFIDF of a tweet based on the TF and IDF values of its tokens.",
        "PRA is a phrase reinforcement algorithm that can produce a one-sentence summary for a given tweets set.",
        "We follow the idea of PRA to generate the token graph of our tweets set and compute the weight for each token node.",
        "We then measure the importance of a tweet by summating the weights of all its tokens, which becomes the ImportPRA feature.",
        "5.1.2 Topic-related measures Topic-related features are used to capture important tweets based on the topical information embodied by named entities (NE) or latent topic semantics.",
        "TopicNE is proposed to utilize NE as indicator for describing an event.",
        "We resort to Stanford Name Entity Recognizer 5 to extract seven types of named entities including time, location, organization, person, money, percent and date.",
        "Based on that, we count entities in the tweet, and then obtain seven additional binary values indicating the presence of each category.",
        "TopicLDA is used to capture sub-topics.",
        "Intuitively, if a tweet is highly related to some subtopic in the event, it is more important.",
        "We use LDA (Blei et al., 2003) to identify the sub-topics in the tweets set.",
        "Based on the resulted sub-topics and term distribution, we first calculate the maximum relevance value between the tweet and all sub-topics as a feature.",
        "Then, we obtain the distribution of relevance values of the tweet with respect to all sub-topics and compute the entropy of this distribution as another feature.",
        "The lower the entropy is, the higher the degree of topical concentration for the tweet.",
        "We use the default setting of the toolkit mallet 6 and set the number of sub-topics as 10 empirically.",
        "5.1.3 Writing-quality measures Writing-quality features indicate if a tweet is written in a formal way.",
        "Intuitively if more formally a tweet is written, it is more likely to be extracted.",
        "QualityOOV measures to what extent a tweet contains out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens.",
        "We simply calculate the number and the percentage of the OOV words in the tweet as features 7 .",
        "QualityLM measures writing quality of a tweet based on language model.",
        "We train uni-gram, bi-gram and tri-gram language models using maximum-likelihood estimation.",
        "By summating the probabilities of all the tokens in the tweet regarding the three different language models, we obtain three n-gram-based writing-quality features.",
        "QualityDepend measures the writing quality based on dependency relation.",
        "The dependency feature is generated following Han et al. (2011).",
        "Instead of using the technique for normalizing tweet text, we apply it for assessing the grammaticality of tweets 8 .",
        "5.2 Cross-media Correlation Features We observe that Twitter users like to quote or rewrite the important pieces of new content in the posts.",
        "If a news sentence is referred or paraphrased by many tweets, it is assumed to be indicated as more important.",
        "On the other hand, a tweet, besides its local importance indicator, may be more important if it is similar to the theme of the news content.",
        "Therefore, cross-media correlation features are designed to incorporate the auxiliary information source for helping instance ranking.",
        "In task 1, news articles are local content and the corresponding tweets are considered auxiliary, and in task 2 their roles are reversed.",
        "5.2.1 Instance-level similarities Instance-level similarities indicate if there are auxiliary instances similar to the current local instance and to what extent they are similar.",

        "We use four general metrics including cosine, ROUGE-1 F-value, ROUGE-1 precision score and ROUGE-1 recall score to measure the surface similarity between news sentence and tweet.",
        "And the other three features, namely LeadSenSimi, TitleSimi and MaxSenPos are only used in task 2 for ranking tweets when news sentences are considered as auxiliary.",
        "This is because leading sentences and title of news are considered as the most informative content.",
        "The more similar a tweet to them, the more important it can be.",
        "Also, position information is often used for document summarization.",
        "We borrow the position of the most similar sentence as bridge to measure the importance of a given tweet.",
        "5.2.2 Semantic-space-level similarities Semantic-space-level similarities reflect the importance of the current local instance based on the distribution of its semantic units in the auxiliary resource.",
        "We propose two features to represent the distribution of the semantic units that are based on unigram frequency and unigram TF-IDF, and named as SimiUnigram and SimiUniTFIDF, respectively.",
        "We first obtain a unigram distribution on the auxiliary space, and compute the similarity of a local instance by summing over the probabilities of all its unigrams in the distribution.",
        "Additionally, we also identify some most frequent named entities and unigrams in the auxiliary information source, and then compute the presence and the count of them in the current local instance as additional features, which are named as SimiTopEntity and SimiTopUnigram.",
        "6 Experiments and Results 6.1 Setup Task 1 extracts highlights from news articles.",
