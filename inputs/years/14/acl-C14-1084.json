        "With the rapid development of web-based services, concerns about user privacy have heightened.",
        "The privacy policies of online websites, which serve as a legal agreement between service providers and users, are not easy for people to understand and therefore offer an opportunity for natural language processing.",
        "In this paper, we consider a corpus of these policies, and tackle the problem of aligning or grouping segments of policies based on the privacy issues they address.",
        "A dataset of pairwise judgments from humans is used to evaluate two methods, one based on clustering and another based on a hidden Markov model.",
        "Our analysis suggests a five-point gap between system and median-human levels of agreement with a consensus annotation, of which half can be closed with bag of words representations and half requires more sophistication."

        "Privacy policies are legal documents, authored by privacy lawyers to protect the interests of companies offering services through the web.",
        "According to a study conducted by McDonald and Cranor (2008), if every internet user in the U.S. read the privacy notice of each new website she visited, it would take the nation 54 billion hours annually to read privacy policies.",
        "It is not surprising that they often go unread (Federal Trade Commission, 2012).",
        "Users, nonetheless, might do well to understand the implications of agreeing to a privacy policy, and might make different choices if they did.",
        "Researchers in the fields of internet privacy and security have made various attempts to standardize the format of privacy notices, so that they are easier to understand and to allow the general public to have better control of their personal information.",
        "An early effort is the Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P), which defines a machine-readable language that enables the websites to explicitly declare their intended use of personal information (Cranor, 2002).",
        "Many other studies primarily focus on the qualitative perspective of policies and use tens of carefully selected privacy notices.",
        "For example, Kelley et al. (2010) proposed a ?nutrition label?",
        "approach that formalizes the privacy policy into a standardized table format.",
        "Breaux et al. (2014) map privacy requirements encoded in text to a formal logic, in order to detect conflicts in requirements and trace data flows (e.g., what data might be collected, to whom the data will be transferred and for what purposes).",
        "The need for automatically or semi-automatically generating simple, easy-to-digest privacy summaries is further exacerbated by the emergence of the mobile Web and the Internet of Things, with early efforts in this area including the use of static analysis to identify sensitive data flows in mobile apps (Lin et al., 2012) and the development of mobile app privacy profiles (Liu et al., 2014).",
        "Increased automation for such efforts motivates our interest in privacy policies as a text genre for NLP, with the general goal of supporting both user-oriented tools that interpret policies and studies of the contents of policies by legal scholars.",
        "In this paper, we start with a corpus of 1,010 policies collected from widely-used websites (Ramanath et al., 2014), 1 and seek to automatically align segments of policies.",

        "3 These statements are concerned with the usage of cookies?small data files transferred by a website to the user's computer hard drive?often used for tracking a user's browsing behavior.",
        "Cookies are one issue among many that are addressed by privacy policies; by aligning segments by issue, across policies, we can begin to understand the range of policy approaches for each issue.",
        "We contribute pairwise annotations of segment pairs drawn from different policies, for use in evaluating the quality of alignments, an analysis of the inter-annotator reliability, and an experimental assessment of three alignment methods, one based on clustering and two based on a hidden Markov model.",
        "This paper's results refine the findings of Ramanath et al. (2014).",
        "Our key finding is that these unsupervised methods reach far better agreement with the consensus of crowdworkers than originally estimated, and that the gap between these methods and the ?median?",
        "crowdworker is about half due to the greedy nature of such methods and about half due to the bag of words representation.",
        "2 Privacy Dataset and Annotations For completeness, we review the corpus of privacy policies presented by Ramanath et al. (2014), and then present the new annotations created for evaluation of alignment.",
        "2.1 Corpus We collected 1,010 unique privacy policy documents from the top websites ranked by Alexa.com.",
        "4 These policies were collected during a period of six weeks during December 2013 and January 2014.",
        "They are a snapshot of privacy policies of mainstream websites covering fifteen of Alexa.com's seventeen categories (Table 2).",

        "Though many well-regulated commercial websites provide a ?privacy?",
        "link on their homepages, not all do.",
        "We found university websites to be exceptionally unlikely to provide such a link.",
        "Even once the policy's URL is identified, extracting the text presents the usual challenges associated with scraping documents from the web.",
        "Since every site is different in its placement of the document (e.g., buried deep within the website, distributed across several pages, or mingled together with Terms of Service) and format (e.g., HTML, PDF, etc.",
        "), and since we wish to preserve as much document structure as possible (e.g., section labels), full automation was not a viable solution.",

        "The annotations conducted for this study were done somewhat differently.",
        "Our motivations were to enable a more careful exploration of inter-annotator agreement, which was complicated in the earlier work by the variable number of annotations per pair, from three to fifteen.",
        "We also sought to explore a more fine-grained problem at the paragraph level.",
        "We sampled 1,000 document pairs from each of the 15 categories, then generated pairs (separately of sections and of paragraphs) by choosing one at random from each document.",
        "In total, 1,278,204 section pairs and 7,968,487 paragraph pairs were produced.",
        "These pairs were stratified by cosine similarity intervals: [0, 0.25], (0.25, 0.5], (0.5, 0.75], (0.75, 1], as in Ramanath et al. (2014).",
        "We sampled 250 pairs from each interval, resulting in 1,000 pairs each of sections and paragraphs.",

        "2.3 Discussion We had expected higher agreement at the paragraph level, since paragraphs are shorter, presumably easier to read and compare, and presumably more focused on a smaller number of issues.",

        "3 Problem Formulation Given a collection of privacy policy documents and assuming each document consists of a sequence of naturally-occurring text segments (e.g., sections or paragraphs), our goal is to automatically group the text segments that address the same privacy issue, without pre-specifying the set of such issues.",
        "We believe this exemplifies many scenarios where a collection of documents follow a similar content paradigm, such as legal documents and, in some cases, scientific literature.",
        "Our interest in algorithms that characterize each individual document's parts in the context of the corpus is inspired by biological sequence alignment in computational biology (Durbin et al., 1998).",
        "In our experiments, we consider a hidden Markov model (HMM) that captures local transitions between topics.",
        "The motivation for the HMM is that privacy policies might tend to order issues similarly, e.g., the discussion on ?sharing information to third parties?",
        "appears to often follow the discussion of ?personal information collection.?",
        "If each of these corresponds to an HMM state, then the regularity in ordering is captured by the transition distribution, and each state is characterized by its emission distribution over words.",

        "We denote O t = [O 1 t , O 2 t , ..., O N t t ], where each O j t corresponds to a word token in the tth text segment; N t is the total number of word tokens in the segment; T represents the total number of segments in the observation sequence.",

        "This expectation is supported by recommendation by privacy experts (Gellman, 2014) and policymakers (Federal Trade Commission, 2012); in the financial services sector, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires these institutions to address a specific set of issues.",

        "Methodologically, the HMM used above is very similar to extensive previous uses of HMMs for POS tagging (Merialdo, 1994), including with Bayesian inference (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Johnson, 2007; Gao and Johnson, 2008).",
        "Bayesian topic models (Blei et al., 2003) are a related set of techniques, and future exploration might consider their use in automatically discovering document sections (Eisen- stein and Barzilay, 2008), rather than fixing section or paragraph boundaries.",
