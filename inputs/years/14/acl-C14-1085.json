        "Automatically attributing a piece of text to its author is one of the oldest problems studied in linguistics (Mendenhall, 1887).",
        "Despite being an old problem, authorship attribution is still highly topical and todays applications range from plagiarism detection (Maurer et al., 2006), identifying the origin of anonymous harassments in emails, blogs, and chat rooms (Tan et al., 2013) to copyright and estate issues as well as resolving historical questions of disputed authorship (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964; Fung, 2003).",
        "Intrinsically, the goal of authorship detection is to identify the characteristic traits of an author.",
        "The idea is that, these traits distinguish an author from others in terms of writing style, use of words, etc.",
        "Thus, prior work often focuses on designing and extracting features from text to capture these traits.",
        "There is a great deal of features proposed for authorship detection, including word or character n-grams (Burrows, 1987; Houvardas and Stamatatos, 2006), part-of-speech (Stamatatos et al., 2001), probabilistic context-free grammars (Raghavan et al., 2010), or linguistic features (Koppel et al., 2006).",
        "However, indicative features for one author do not necessarily help to characterise another.",
        "A major problem in authorship detection is therefore to find the right set of features for a given task at hand (Forman, 2003).",
        "Algorithmically, a variety of different models have been studied in the context of authorship detection, ranging from probabilistic approaches (Seroussi et al., 2011) and similarity-based methods (Koppel et al., 2011) to vector space models (Fung, 2003; Li et al., 2006).",
        "The approaches either treat documents as independent (instance-based) or concatenate documents by the same author (profile-based).",
        "Intuitively, the latter is helpful if an author has a concise way of expressing herself so that the concatenated document allows to extract a statistic that is sufficient for capturing her style.",
        "On the other hand, instance-based approaches are better suited for expressive authors and have advantages in sparse data scenarios.",
        "Another aspect in authorship attribution is the application scenario of the final model.",
        "In transductive (in-sample) settings, the unlabelled documents of interest are already included in the training process ",
        "895 ?4 ?2 0 2 4 ?2 ?1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 ?4 ?2 0 2 4 ?2 ?1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 ?4 ?2 0 2 4 ?2 ?1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Figure 1: Three solutions of an anomaly detection problem where data is represented by RBF kernels with different band-width parameters.",
        "Combining anomaly detection with multiple kernel learning allows to include all three kernels simultaneously in the optimisation and to find the optimal linear mixture of the three (or more) kernels together automatically for a given task.",
        "and the model does not necessarily perform well on new and unseen texts.",
        "By contrast, inductive (out- of-sample) scenarios generally allow to learn models that can be applied to any future text but require larger training samples to achieve accurate performances.",
        "In this paper, we propose a general machine learning-based approach to authorship detection.",
        "Our approach remedies the above mentioned problems by fusing existing techniques: (i) We cast authorship attribution as an anomaly detection problem where one model is learned for every author.",
        "The idea is to identify a concise region in feature space that contains (most of) the documents of the author of interest while other documents are considered outliers.",
        "Thus, the model can be viewed as a profile-based approach in feature space while the data is treated on an instance-based level.",
        "(ii) We remedy the in-sample / out-of-sample problem by providing a semi-supervised extension of the commonly unsupervised outlier detection framework.",
        "By doing so, we may include authorship labels for the already known documents and leave the disputed ones unlabelled.",
        "(iii) Finally, we devise our model consequentially as a member of the multiple kernel learning family to automatically include a mathematically well founded feature selection framework that renders the method generally applicable.",
        "The optimal solution is given by a (possibly sparse) linear mixture of kernel functions.",
        "Empirically, we observe that our approach consistently outperforms baseline competitors or confirms common knowledge with respect to the authorship of disputed articles.",
        "The main advantage of the method however lies in its simplicity.",
        "Practitioners do not need to take critical design choices in terms of which features to use and which not.",
        "By contrast, all features (kernels) can be used in the optimisation and the method itself finds the optimal combination for the problem at hand.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 reviews related work.",
        "Our main contribution is presented in Section 3.",
        "We report on empirical results in Section 4 and Section 5 concludes.",
        "2 Related Work Authorship attribution using linguistic and stylistic features has a long tradition and can be dated back to the nineteenth century.",
        "As a first attempt, Mendenhall (Mendenhall, 1887) uses features based on word lengths to characterise the plays of Shakespeare.",
        "Later in the first half of the 20th century, different textual statistics, such as Zipf's distribution (Zipf, 1932) and Yule's k-statistic (Yule, 1944) have been proposed to quantify textual style.",
        "A study conducted by (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964) is one of the most influential modern work in authorship attribution.",
        "They use a Bayesian approach to analyse frequencies of a small set of function words for The Federalist Papers, a series of 85 political essays written by John Jay, Alexander Hamilton, and James Madison.",
        "Until the late 1990s, research in stylometry has been dominated by feature engineering to quantify writing style (Holmes, 1998) and about 1,000 different measures have been proposed (Rudman, 1997).",
        "896 Document representation is essential for author attribution tasks.",
        "Features aim to capture characteristic traits of authors that persist across topics.",
        "Traditional stylometric features include function and high-frequency words, hapax legomena, Yules k-statistic, syllable distributions, sentence length, word length and word frequencies, vocabulary richness functions as well as syntactic features.",
        "Many studies combine features of different types using multivariate analyses.",
        "Some researchers use punctuation symbols while others experiment with n-grams (Diederich et al., 2003).",
        "Grammatical style markers with natural language processing techniques are also used to extract features from the documents.",
        "Also in terms of technical approaches, authorship attribution has been studied with a wide range of different approaches.",
        "The deployed techniques can be broadly divided into three categories: machine learning (Diederich et al., 2003), multivariate/cluster analysis (Khmelev, 2000), and natural language processing (Stamatatos et al., 2000).",
        "Principal components analysis (PCA) is one of the widely used techinques for authorship studies, for instance, (Holmes and Crofts, 2010) apply PCA to identify the authorship of unknown articles that have been attributed to Stephen Crane.",
        "In addition, machine learning-based approaches, including neural networks (Neme et al., 2011) and support vector machines (SVMs) (Diederich et al., 2003), are frequently used to discriminate documents by different authors.",
        "An excellent survey on the diversity of approaches for authorship detection is provided by (Stamatatos, 2009).",
        "Density level set estimation, also known as one-class learning (Tax and Duin, 1999; Sch?olkopf et al., 1999), is the problem of learning a representation of a single class of interest, rejecting data points that deviate from the learned model of normality.",
        "Thus, it has been proven very successful in anomaly detection scenarios such as network intrusion detection (G?ornitz et al., 2009).",
        "Various extensions have been proposed, i.e. to incorporate prior and additional knowledge (G?ornitz et al., 2013; Blanchard et al., 2010) in a semi-supervised fashion (Chapelle et al., 2006) and to learn linear combinations of kernels (Kloft et al., 2011; Rakotomamonjy et al., 2008) which is especially usefull whenever the right choice of representation is unknown.",
        "3 Methodology In this section, we cast semi-supervised anomaly detection as an instance of multiple kernel learning.",
        "The rational for this idea is shown in Figure 1.",
        "The figure shows three solutions for an anomaly detection task.",
        "The data is represented by RBF kernels with different band-width parameters.",
        "As shown in the figure, the choice of the band width parameter is crucial and leads to very different solutions.",
        "Usually, kernel parameters are thus included in the model selection and their optimisation is often time consuming.",
        "Fusing the anomaly detection with multiple kernel learning allows to include all three kernels simultaneously in the optimisation and to find the best linear mixture of the three (or more) kernels together with model parameters for the data at hand.",
        "We briefly review anomaly detection and semi-supervised anomaly detection in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, respectively, and present our main contribution, multiple kernel learning for anomaly detection, in Section 3.3.",
        "3.1 Preliminaries Anomaly detection is often cast as an unsupervised one-class problem where the goal is to find a hyperplane that separates the majority of the input examples from the origin with maximum margin, so that, by definition, points not exceeding the hyperplane are considered outliers.",
        "Analogously, we aim to learn a separating hyperplane for articles by an author of interest, such that documents not exceeding the learned hyperplane are written by other authors.",

        "The reduced data contains 1000 articles written by 10 authors, Aaron Pressman, Alan Crosby, Alexander Smith, Benjamin Kang Lim, Bernard Hickey, Brad Dorfman, Darren Schuettler, David Lawder, Edna Fernandes, and Eric Auchard.",
        "We deploy the following four kernels to represent documents: the first kernel is made of 484 function words taken from (Koppel and Schler, 2003), the second contains part-of-speech (POS) tags, the third is assembled by 3-letter suffixes, the last one simply a bag-of-words (BOW) kernel.",
        "We split the data into training (90%) and test (10%) sets and conduct a 10-fold cross-validation on the training set for model selection.",
        "The best performing models are then evaluated on the test set.",
        "In this set of ex-periments, we use a transductive setting where all training instances are labeled and only holdout and test articles are unlabelled.",

        "The results in terms of averaged micro- and macro-F 1 measures are shown in Table 1.",
        "MKL consistently outperforms the single-kernel baseline for all p-norms.",
        "That is, instead of extensively experimenting with SSAD and different kernel functions and parameter selections, a single run with our MKL already leads to better performances in both metrics.",
        "The rightmost column in the table shows the result for SSAD using a sum of the input kernels.",
        "Apparently, the performance is worse than using a bag-of-words kernel alone.",

        "They were published anonymously to persuade the citizens of the State of New York to ratify the Constitution.",
        "Later, these papers were credited to Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison; 73 of the documents are uniquely associated with one of the three authors while the remaining 12, also known as the disputed papers, have been claimed by both, Hamilton and Madison.",
        "Three of the 73 articles are considered joint work by Hamilton and Madison.",
        "Previous studies often assign all 12 disputed papers to Madison which we assume as ground-truth in the remainder (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964; Fung, 2003).",
        "To confirm or refuse these previous findings, we conduct an experiment using same four kernels as in the previous section, that is, a function words kernel (Koppel and Schler, 2003), a part-of-speech (POS) tag kernel, a Suffix-3 kernel, and a bag-of-words (BOW) kernel.",
        "We compare the performance of our approach (MKL) with semi-supervised anomaly detection (SSAD) (G?ornitz et al., 2013), support vector data description (SVDD) (Tax and Duin, 1999), and the one-class SVM (OCSVM) (Sch?olkopf et al., 1999).",
        "As before, the baselines cannot use all kernels at a time and are evaluated on every kernel separately.",
        "For simplicity, we show only the MKL results for parameter p = 2 as all other p-norms that we tried out lead to the same result.",

        "The one-class SVM and SVDD constantly credit the 12 disputed articles as joint work by Hamilton and Madison.",
        "The outcome of SSAD highly depends on the kernel function; while the part-of-speech kernel distributes the papers on Jay (3) and Hamilton and Madison (9), respectively, the bag-of-words kernel assigns all documents to Hamilton.",
        "By contrast, SVDD with function word and Suffix-3 kernels attribute the articles to Madison.",
        "The same outcome is observed for our novel MKL that also credits the 12 papers to Madison.",
        "Thus, MKL and SSAD with function words and BoW kernel confirm todays assumption that all 12 papers have been written by Madison.",
        "However, choosing SSAD as the base classifier in the absence of prior knowledge leaves much room for interpretations and the user in the need of deciding between three solutions, depending on which kernel she prefers.",
        "By using our MKL, selecting features and or kernel functions is no longer necessary as the learning algorithm itself picks the right combination of kernels for the problem at hand.",
        "Thus, the more kernels are thrown into, the richer the decision space for the MKL.",
        "5 Conclusion We proposed a universal method for authorship detection.",
        "Our approach built upon semi-supervised anomaly detection and generalised existing techniques to utilise multiple kernels; a requirement which is particularly beneficial for authorship attribution as features are usually tailored to tasks at hand and do not necessarily translate well to other authors.",
        "Our method is proven to converge to the optimal solution and simple to implement.",
        "Our empirical results show the robustness of our approach as it consistently outperforms baseline competitors on a subset of Reuters 50-50 or confirms common knowledge wrt the authorship of disputed articles of the Federalist Papers.",
        "The main advantage of the method however lies in its simplicity.",
        "Practitioners do not need to take critical design choices in terms of which features to use and which not.",
        "By contrast, all features (kernels) can be used in the optimisation and the method itself finds the optimal combination for the problem at hand.",
