        "Abstract",
        "Document enrichment is the task of retrieving additional knowledge from external resource over what is available through source document.",
        "This task is essential because of the phenomenon that text is generally replete with gaps and ellipses since authors assume a certain amount of background knowledge.",
        "The recovery of these gaps is intuitively useful for better understanding of document.",
        "Conventional document enrichment techniques usually rely on Wikipedia which has great coverage but less accuracy, or Ontology which has great accuracy but less coverage.",
        "In this study, we propose a document enrichment framework which automatically extracts ?argument 1 , predicate, argument 2 ?",
        "triple from any text corpus as background knowledge, so that to ensure the compatibility with any resource (e.g. news text, ontology, and on-line ency-clopedia) and improve the enriching accuracy.",
        "We first incorporate source document and background knowledge together into a triple based document-level graph and then propose a global iterative ranking model to propagate relevance score and select the most relevant knowledge triple.",
        "We evaluate our model as a ranking problem and compute the MAP and P&N score to validate the ranking result.",
        "Our final result, a MAP score of 0.676 and P&20 score of 0.417 outperform a strong baseline based on search engine by 0.182 in MAP and 0.04 in P&20."

        "Document enrichment is the task to acquire background knowledge from external resources and recover the omitted information automatically for certain document.",
        "This task is essential because authors usually omit basic but well-known information to make the document more concise.",
        "For example, author omits ?Baghdad is the captain of Iraqi?",
        "in the text of Figure 1 (a), which is well-known to readers.",
        "During reading process, these gaps will be automatically plugged effortlessly by the background knowledge in human brain.",
        "However, the situation is different for machine because it lacks the ability to acquire and select the proper background knowledge, which limits the performances of certain NLP applications.",
        "Document enrichment has been proved helpful in these tasks such as web search (Pantel and Fuxman, 2011), coreference resolution (Bryl et al., 2010), document cluster (Hu et al., 2009) and entity disambiguation (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006; Sen, 2012).",
        "In the past, there are mainly two kinds of document enrichment researches according to the resource they relying on.",
        "The first line of works make use of WikiPedia, the largest available on-line encyclopedia as resource and link the entity (e.g. Baghdad) of document to its corresponding Wiki page (e.g. Baghdad 1 in WikiPedia), so that to enrich the document with the context of Wiki page (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006; Cucerzan, 2007; Han et al., 2011; Kataria et al., 2011; Sen, 2012; He et al., 2013).",
        "Despite the great success of these methods, there remain a great challenge that not all information in the linked Wiki page is helpful to the understanding of corresponding document.",
        "For example, the Wiki page of Baghdad contains lots of information about city history and culture, which are not quite relevant to the semantic of context in Figure 1 (a).",
        "So treating the whole Wiki page as the enrichment to document may cause noise ?",

        "Besides, these methods usually rely on special ontology which is rather difficult to construct and in turn limits the coverage and application of these methods.",
        "Ideally, we would wish to integrate both coverage and accuracy, where an triple based background knowledge ranking model may help.",
        "Our framework extracts knowledge from any corpus resource including WikiPedia to ensure coverage and present knowledge as ?argument 1 , predicate, argument 2 ?",
        "triple to reduce noise.",
        "This model ranks background knowledge triples according to their relevance to the source document.",
        "The key idea behind the model is that document is constructed by several units of information, which can be extracted automatically.",
        "For every background knowledge b extracted automatically from a relevant corpus, the more units are relevant to b and the more important they are, the more relevant b becomes to the source document.",
        "Thus, we extract both source document information and background knowledge automatically and present them together in a document-level graph.",
        "Then we propagate the relevance score from the source document information to the background knowledge during an iterative process.",
        "After convergence, we obtain the Top n relevant background knowledge, rather than retrieving all of them without filtering.",
        "To evaluate our model, we use ACE 2 corpus as source documents and output the ranked list of background knowledge.",
        "Then we train three annotators to check the ranking result and annotating whether certain knowledge is relevant to corresponding source document separately.",
        "We totally annotated more than 7000 background knowledge by three annotators.",

        "The ranking result is evaluated with MAP score and P&N score (Voorhees et al., 2005).",
        "We finally achieve aMAP score of 0.676 and P&20 score of 0.417 in Top 20 background knowledge, which are higher by 0.182 and 0.04 than a strong baseline based on search engine.",
        "We also evaluate the effect of the automatically extraction to source document and background knowledge, which is key to the performance of our method in real application.",
        "2 Triple Graph based Document Representation We believe that different parts of document are related to each other, rather than isolated.",
        "Hence, we propose a triple graph based document representation to incorporate source document information and background knowledge.",

        "After introducing the information from other elements of the triple, ?earn, law degree?",
        "help to disambiguate and limit Obama to the law graduate of Harvard University only in Figure 2 (b).",
        "The form of triple has been used as the presentation of knowledge in some researches such as knowledge base (Hoffart et al., 2013).",
        "2.2 Nodes in the Graph There are two kinds of nodes in the triple graph: source document nodes (sd-nodes) and background knowledge nodes (bk-nodes).",
        "Both of them are extracted automatically with Open Information Extraction (Open IE) technology which focuses on extracting assertions from massive corpora without a pre-specied vocabulary (Banko et al., 2007).",
        "Open IE systems are unlexicalized-formed only in terms of syntactic tokens and closed-word classes, instead of specific nouns and verbs at all costs.",
        "There are existing Open IE systems such as TextRunner (Banko et al., 2007), WOE (Wu and Weld, 2010), and StatSnowball (Zhu et al., 2009).",
        "The output of these systems has been used to support many NLP tasks such as learning selectional preference (Ritter et al., 2010), acquiring sense knowledge (Lin et al., 2010), and recognizing entailment (Schoenmackers et al., 2010).",
        "In this work, we use the famous Open IE system Reverb (Etzioni et al., 2011), which is generated from TextRunner (Etzioni et al., 2008), to extract source document information and background knowledge automatically.",
        "We use the newest version of ReVerb (version 1.3) without modification, which is free download on-line 3 .",
        "Source document node (sd-node) Sd-nodes consists of the information extracted from source document automatically by open information extraction technology (Banko et al., 2007), especially Reverb, the famous Open IE system developed by University of Washington (Etzioni et al., 2011).",
        "The output of ReVerb is formed as ?argument 1 , predicate, argument 2 ?, which is naturally presented as triple.",
        "In this study, we use ACE corpus as source documents and all sd-nodes are extracted by ReVerb.",
        "The setup of automatic extraction makes our method usable in many real applications.",
        "To evaluate the effect of automatic extraction, we also use the golden annotation within ACE (Doddington et al., 2004) corpus as source document information and compare the performance that with automatic extraction.",
        "Background knowledge node (bk-node) Bk-nodes consist of the background knowledge extracted from external corpus resources automatically by Reverb too.",
        "We do not rely on certain existed knowledge base and extract background knowledge from external corpus resources for corresponding source document.",
        "This setup makes our methods usable in many real applications.",
        "Although we do not rely on special knowledge base, we do adapt our method for the existed knowledge base such as YAGO (Hoffart et al., 2013) and compare the performance to evaluate the effect of different knowledge sources.",
        "2.3 Edges in the Graph The edges between two nodes indicate their semantic relevance, which is evaluated in Section 3.1.",
        "There are two kinds of edges: (1) sd-node to sd-node (2) sd-node to bk-node, both of them are undirected.",
        "Considering all the relevance score originating from sd-nodes, we connect no edge between bk-nodes.",
        "3 http://reverb.cs.washington.edu/ 919 Edges between sd-nodes All sd-nodes are extracted from the same document, so they should be related to each other.",
        "We connect each pair of sd-nodes with an edge and set the weight of edge as their semantic relevance computed in Section 3.1.",
        "With this setup, we combine the source document as a whole where different parts affect each other through the edge.",
        "Edges between sd-node and bk-node The basic idea of our model is to propagate relevance score from the sd-nodes to bk-nodes.",
        "Hence, we connect each pair of sd-node and bk-node with an edge and set the weight of the edge as their relevance computed in Section 3.1.",
        "These edges are all undirected, which indicates that bk-nodes also affect the relevance score of the sd-nodes during the ranking process.",
        "3 Global Ranking Model In this study, source document D is presented as the graph of sd-nodes.",
        "For every background knowledge b, the task of evaluating the relevance between b and D is naturally converted into evaluating the relevance between b and the graph of sd-nodes.",
        "So the relevance between b and document D can be computed by propagating the relevance score from every sd-node of D to b iteratively.",
        "After the convergence, the relevance between b and D can be evaluated by the relevance score of b. Intuitively, three factors affect their relevance: ?",
        "How many sd-nodes is b relevant to ?",
        "?",
        "How relevant is b to these sd-nodes?",
        "?",
        "How important are these sd-nodes ?",
        "For the first factor, b should be more relevant to source document D if more sd-nodes are relevant to b. We capture this information by allowing b to receive relevance score from all the sd-nodes.",
        "For the second factor, b should be more relevant to D if more relevant b is to sd-nodes.",
        "We consider this information by evaluating the relevance between b and every sd-node (Section 3.1).",
        "For the last factor, important sd-nodes should have higher impact.",
        "We consider this information by evaluating the importance of sd-nodes and assigning higher initial value to importance ones (Section 3.3).",
        "We combine all factors in the global ranking process to select the top-n relevant background knowledge (Section3.2).",
        "3.1 Relevance Evaluation between Nodes In this section, we evaluate the semantic relevance between different nodes which is the weight of the edge between them.",
        "We introduce Search Engine as a resource, which has been proven effective in relevance evaluation (Gligorov et al., 2007).",
        "This method is motivated by the phenomenon that the number of results returned by search engine for query p ?",
        "qindicates the relevance between p and q.",
        "However, considering the different popularization of queries, this number alone can not accurately express their semantic relevance.",
        "For example, query car ?",
        "automobile gets 294, 300, 000 results, whereas query car?apple gets 683, 000, 000, which is 2 times higher than the previous one.",
        "Obviously, automobile is more relevant to car rather than Apple.",
        "The reason of this phenomenon is that apple is far more popular than automobile, which increase its possibility of co-occurrence with car.",
        "So we consider the number of results for p?q together with p and q withWebJaccard Coefficient (Bollegala et al., 2007) to evaluate the relevance between p and q according to Formula 1, where H(p), H(q), and H(p ?",

        "(1) To convert one ?argument 1 , predicate, argument 2 ?",
        "triple into query, we use argument 1 ?",
        "argument 2 as the query for one triple.",
        "We have tried argument 1 ?",
        "predicate ?",
        "argument 2 which 920 is usually very sparse.",
        "Besides, the combination of two arguments usually maintain better semantic completeness of triple compared to other combinations according to our analysis.",
        "So this setup aims to balance completeness and sparseness.",
        "Accordingly, two triples are combined as argument 1 ?argument 2 ?",
        "argument ?",

        "2 .",
        "Considering the scale and noise in the Web data, it is possible for two words to appear together accidentally.",
        "To reduce the adverse effects attributed to random co-occurrences, we set 0 to the WebJaccard Coefficient of query p?",
        "q, if the number of result is less than a threshold C. 3.2 Iterative Relevance Propagation Here we propose the relevance propagation based iterative process to evaluate the relevance between certain background knowledge and source document.",
        "Note that standard label propagation mainly focuses on classification task (Wang and Zhang, 2008).",
        "However, we focus on a ranking problem where the best ranking result is computed during an iterative process in this study.",
        "So we make two modifications to suit the ranking problem better: not reseting the relevance score and introducing the propagation between source document information during iteration.",
        "Propagation possibility The edge between node i and node j is weighted by r(i, j) to measure their relevance.",
        "However, r(i, j) cannot completely present the propagation possibility because one node can be equally relevant to all of its neighbors.",
        "Thus, we define p(i, j) based on r(i, j) in formula 2 to indicate the propagation possibility between node i and node j .",
        "p(i, j) = r(i, j)?",

        "So that we keep updating both sd-nodes and bk-nodes and do not distinguish them explicitly.",

        "We return ~ V to the global ranking model (Section 3.2) as part of the input.",
        "The initial importance of bk-nodes is set as 0 at the beginning, which denotes that all bk-nodes are ir-relevant to source document before the starting of global ranking process.",
        "4 Experiment We treat our task as a ranking problem, which takes a document as input and output the ranked list of background knowledge.",
        "We evaluate our method as a ranking problem similarly to information retrieval task and focus on the performances of models with different setups.",
        "4.1 Data Preparation The experiment data consists of two parts: source document information and corresponding background knowledge.",
        "To select source documents, we use the ACE corpus (Doddington et al., 2004) for 2005 evaluation 4 which consists of 599 articles from multiple sources.",
        "We use ReVerb to extract these documents into multi-triples.",
        "For background knowledge, we first retrieve relevant web pages with simply term matching method and then extract these pages with ReVerb into a set of triples serving as background knowledge.",
        "To ensure the quality, we filter them according to the confidence given by ReVerb.",
        "Besides automatic extraction, we also adapt our system to the golden annotation of ACE as source document information and standard YAGO knowledge base 5 as background knowledge (Hoffart et al., 2013).",
        "We compare its performance with that in fully automatic system and evaluate the effect of automatic extraction.",
        "For better comparison with YAGO, we retrieve relevant pages from WikiPedia although our automatic extraction method is applicable to any corpus resources.",
        "For every outputted list, three trained annotators check the result and decide which background knowledge is relevant to source document.",

        "Kappa value of 0.8066 in best situation and 0.7076 in average between three anno-tators, which is a good consistence between multi-annotator (Fleiss, 1971).",
        "When collision happened, we choose the label selected by more annotators.",
        "4.2 Baseline system Although we treat our task as a ranking problem, it is difficult to apply corresponding methods in traditional ranking tasks such as information retrieval (IR) (Manning et al., 2008) and entity linking (EL) (Han et al., 2011; Kataria et al., 2011; Sen, 2012) directly in our task.",
        "First, both IR and EL make use of the link structure between web or Wiki pages.",
        "However, our task takes single document as input and no link exists between documents which makes it difficult to apply IR and EL methods such as page rank (Page et al., 1999) and collective method (Han et al., 2011; Sen, 2012) in this task directly.",
        "Second, EL usually evaluate the text similarity between certain document and target page in WikiPedia.",
        "However, our task focuses on the ranking of ?argument 1 , predicate, argument 2 ?",
        "triple, which contains little text information.",
        "Lack of text information also limits the application of corresponding methods in our task.",

        "For better comparison, we introduce search engine as resource which is proved effective in relevance evaluation (Gligorov et al., 2007) and propose a search engine based strong baseline.",
        "As illustrated before, the relevance R i between background knowledge b i and source document D has been converted into the relevance between b i and the triples of D. Hence, we compute R i by accumulating all r ij , the relevance scores between b i and every sd-node s j with the same method in Section 3.1 (R i = ?",
        "s j ?S r ij , S is the set of sd-nodes).",
        "Then we rank all background knowledge according to the value ofR i and output the ranked list as final result.",
        "We extract source document and background knowledge automatically in the baseline system, which makes it applicable in different setups.",
        "4.3 Experiment setup We evaluate our model in different setups.",
        "First, we extract both source document information and background knowledge automatically.",
        "Second, we use golden annotation of ACE as source document information but extract background knowledge automatically.",
        "Third, we use golden annotation of ACE and introduce standard YAGO as background knowledge.",
        "For all of them three, we evaluate the different performances with and without initial importance of sd-nodes(Section 3.3).",
        "We evaluate the performance with two famous criteria in ranking problem: MAP (Voorhees et al., 2005) requires more accuracy and focuses on the knowledge in higher position; P&N which require more coverage and pays more attention to the number of relevant ones in Top N knowledge.",
        "Note that we do not evaluate the Recall performance because there can be millions of background knowledge to be ranked for every document.",
        "It is impossible to check all of them.",
        "So we focus on the Top N candidates and evaluate the performance with MAP and P&N .",
        "In this study, we evaluate the Top 20 background knowledge triples which are most easily to be viewed by users.",
        "4.4 Experiment Result The performance of our model is shown in Table 1.",
        "Our search engine based baseline system achieve a rather good performance: a MAP value of 0.494 and 0.377 in P&20.",
        "At the same time, our model outperforms the baseline system in almost every setup and evaluation criterion.",
        "The best performance of MAP is achieved by GoldSD+YAGO (0.676), while the best performance of P&20 is achieved by GoldS-D+AutoBK (0.417).",
        "To analyze the result further, we find that the initial importance, automatic extraction to source document, and to background knowledge have different effect on the final performance.",
        "4.4.1 Effect of automatic extraction to source document We use ACE corpus as source documents, which contain golden annotation to document information.",
        "So we can evaluate the effect of automatic extraction to source document by comparing the performance with and without golden annotation.",
        "The performance without golden annotation is shown in AutoS-D+AutoBK of Table 1, while the other one shown in GoldSD+AutoBK.",
        "We can find that the performance of GoldSD+AutoBK is better than that of AutoSD+AutoBK in both MAP and P&20, which indicates that golden annotation do help to improve the ranking result.",
        "923 We further analyze the result and find an interesting phenomenon: these two systems performs greatly different with the setup of NoInitial, but equally with the setup of WithInitial, which indicates that the performance of AutoSD+AutoBK has been improved by evaluating the importance of source document information (Section 3.3).",
        "So we can naturally infer that, with a better importance evaluating method in AutoSD+AutoBK, we may achieve similar performance compared to that in golden annotation.",
        "Note that, AutoSD+AutoBK is compatible with any corpus which is more useful in real applications.",
        "4.4.2 Effect of automatic extraction to background knowledge We evaluate the effect of automatic extraction to background knowledge by comparing the performances between GoldSD+AutoBK and GoldSD+YAGO.",
        "In GoldSD+AutoBK, the background knowledge is extracted automatically with ReVerb, which has greater coverage but less accuracy.",
        "In contrast, the GoldS-D+YAGO make use of YAGO as background knowledge, which is less coverage but better accuracy.",
        "This difference are reflected on the system performance, where GoldSD+YAGO achieves much better result in MAP, but much worse in P&20.",
        "This is partly because that MAP focus on the background knowledge in higher position which requires more accuracy, while P&20 pays more attention to the number of relevant background knowledge which require more coverage.",
        "In general, automatic extraction system has better coverage but less accuracy compared to YAGO based system.",
        "However, automatic extraction to background knowledge may help in real applications by improving coverage greatly.",
        "Besides, the loss of accuracy is partly due to the technology of information extraction which may be improved in the future.",
        "In addition, we can also combine these two ways to acquire background knowledge to balance coverage and accuracy in the future.",
        "4.4.3 Effect of initial importance to source document information Initial importance to source document information (Section 3.3) is important to the performance of our models as shown in Table 1.",
        "The model AutoSD+AutoBK+WithInitial outperforms the AutoS-D+AutoBK+NoInitial compared to other setups, which indicates the help of initial importance to the ranking result.",
        "Especially, initial importance to source document information helps most in the setup of AutoSD+AutoBK, which is most useful in real applications.",
        "So we can naturally infer that, by proposing better importance evaluating method, we may further improve the performance of AutoS-D+AutoBK+WithInitial, which will great helpful in the future application of this method.",
        "5 Related Work Document enrichment focuses on introducing external knowledge into source document.",
        "There are mainly two kinds of works in this topic according to the resource they relying on.",
        "The first line of works make use of WikiPedia and enrich source document by linking the entity to its corresponding Wiki page (Bunes- cu and Pasca, 2006; Cucerzan, 2007).",
        "In early stage, most researches rely on the similarity between the context of the mention and the definition of candidate entities by proposing different measuring criteria such as dot product, cosine similarity, KL divergence, Jaccard distance and more complicated ones (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006; Cucerzan, 2007; Zheng et al., 2010; Hoffart et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011).",
        "However, these methods mainly rely on text similarity but neglect the internal structure between mentions. So another kind of works explore the structure information with collective disambiguation (Kulkarni et al., 2009; Kataria et al., 2011; Sen, 2012; He et al., 2013).",
        "These methods make use of structure information within context and resolve different mentions based on the coherence among decisions.",
        "Despite the success, the entity linking methods rely on WikiPedia which has great coverage but less accuracy.",
        "Another line of works try to improve the accuracy of enrichment by introducing ontologies (Motta et al., 2000; Passant, 2007; Fodeh et al., 2011; Kumar and Salim, 2012) and structured knowledge such as WordNet (Nastase et al., 2010) and Mesh (Wang and Lim, 2008).",
        "In these studies, resources usually provides word or phrase semantic information such as synonym (Sun et al., 2011) and antonym (Sansonnet and Bouchet, 2010).",
        "However, these methods rely on special ontologies constructed with supervision or even manually, which is difficult to expand and in turn limits the application of them.",
        "924 6 Conclusion and Future Work This study presents a triple based background knowledge ranking model to acquire most relevant background knowledge to certain source document.",
        "We first develop a triple graph based document presentation to combine source document together with the background knowledge.",
        "Then we propose a global iterative ranking model to acquire Top n relevant knowledge, which provide additional information beyond the source document.",
        "Note that, both source document information and background knowledge are extracted automatically which is useful in real application.",
        "The experiments show that our model achieves better results over a strong baseline, which indicates the effectiveness of our framework.",
        "Another interesting phenomenon is that YAGO based enrichment model achieved better ranking ac-curacy, but less coverage compared to automatic extraction model.",
        "To combine these two sources of background knowledge may help to overcome both coverage and accuracy problem.",
        "So exploiting proper way to incorporate knowledge base and automatic extraction is an important topic in our future work.",
        "Finally, we believe that this background knowledge based document enriching technology may help in those semantic based NLP applications such as coherence evaluation, coreference resolution and question answering.",
        "In our future work, we will explore how to make use of these background knowledge in real applications, hopefully to improve the performance significantly in the future.",
