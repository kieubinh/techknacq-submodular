        "Although task-oriented dialogue systems have been extensively researched over the decades (Walker et al., 2001; Williams et al., 2013), it is only recently that non-task-oriented dialogue, open-domain conversation, or chat has been attracting attention for its social and entertainment aspects (Bickmore and Picard, 2005; Ritter et al., 2011; Bessho et al., 2012).",
        "Creating an open-domain conversational system is a challenging problem.",
        "In task-oriented dialogue systems, it is possible to prepare knowledge for a domain and create understanding and generation modules for that domain (Nakano et al., 2000).",
        "However, for open-domain conversation, such preparation cannot be performed.",
        "Since it is difficult to handle users?",
        "open-domain utterances, to create workable systems, conventional approaches have used hand-crafted rules (Wallace, 2004).",
        "Although elaborate rules may work well, the problem with the rule-based approach is the high cost and the dependence on individual skills of developers, which hinders systematic development.",
        "Another problem with the rule-based approach is its low coverage; that is, the inability to handle unexpected utterances.",
        "The recent increase of web data has propelled the development of approaches that use data retrieved from the web for open-domain conversation (Shibata et al., 2009; Ritter et al., 2011).",
        "The merit of such retrieval-based approaches is that, owing to the diversity of the web, systems can retrieve at least some responses for user input, which solves the coverage problem.",
        "However, this comes at the cost of utterance quality.",
        "Since the web, especially Twitter, is inherently noisy, it is, in many cases, difficult to sift out appropriate sentences from retrieval results.",
        "In this paper, we propose an architecture for an open-domain conversational system.",
        "The proposed architecture is fully composed of modules based on natural language processing (NLP) techniques.",
        "Our stance is not just to hand-craft or to search the web for utterances, but to create a system that can fully understand and generate utterances.",
        "We want to show that it is possible to build an open-domain conversational system by combining NLP modules, which will open the way to a systematic development and improvement.",
        "We describe our open-domain conversational system based on our architecture and present results of an evaluation of its performance by human subjects.",
        "We compare our system with rule-based and retrieval-based systems, and show that our architecture is a promising direction.",
        "In this work, we regard the term open-domain conversation to be interchangeable with non-task-oriented dialogue, casual conversation (Eggins and Slade, 2005), chat, or social dialogue (Bickmore and Cassell, 2000).",

        "It should also be noted that we deal with Japanese text chat in this paper, although we believe the architecture to be largely language-independent and extendable with other modalities.",
        "In Section 2, we describe the architecture and its underlying modules.",
        "In Section 3, we describe the rule-based and retrieval-based systems that we use for comparison.",
        "In Section 4, we describe the experiment we performed to evaluate our system.",
        "Section 5 summarizes the paper.",
        "2 Architecture and System Description Figure 1 shows the architecture we propose for an open-domain conversational system.",
        "The architecture has three main components: utterance understanding, dialogue control, and utterance generation.",
        "Following the literature on discourse theory (Grosz and Sidner, 1986), we regard intention (intentional structure), topic (attention state), and content (linguistic structure) as three important elements in con-versation, and seek to create a system that can understand and generate on the basis of them in a general way.",
        "The dialogue control component works by ranking utterance candidates using a general coherence criterion (Hovy, 1991).",
        "Note that the overall architecture is roughly the same as conventional dialogue systems; however, the internal architecture is different so as to allow open-domain conversation.",
        "To give a rough idea of how the system works, Figure 2 shows an example dialogue between our system and a user (one of the subjects in our experiment).",
        "As this example shows, the system can handle various user utterances.",
        "Below, we describe how this is achieved.",
        "2.1 Utterance Understanding Modules We identify dialogue-act, question-type, center-word, and predicate-argument structure (PAS).",
        "Dialogue-act and question-type correspond to intention, center-word to topic, and PAS to content.",
        "We use PASs because they can represent an arbitrary sentence.",
        "For languages other than Japanese, instead of PASs, semantic role labeling (SRL) can be used (Palmer et al., 2010).",
        "Below, we describe each module.",
        "Dialogue-act estimation: As a dialogue-act tag set, we use the one proposed by Meguro et al. (2013).",
        "Although their tag set is designed for annotating listening-oriented dialogue (LoD), since speakers in LoD are allowed to speak freely, the tag set can cover diverse utterances, making it suitable for 929 open-domain conversation.",
        "There are 33 dialogue-acts in the tag set.",
        "See (Meguro et al., 2013) for details.",
        "We used 1259 LoDs annotated with dialogue-acts and trained a classifier using a support vector machine (SVM).",
        "The features used are word N-grams, semantic categories (obtained from a Japanese thesaurus Goi-Taikei (Ikehara et al., 1997)), and character N-grams.",
        "Here, unless otherwise noted, we use JTAG (Fuchi and Takagi, 1998) for morphological analysis in this work.",
        "When we use the LoD data for training and testing, by a ten-fold cross validation, the estimation accuracy is 45%, which is reasonable when considering that the inter-annotator agreement rate is 59%.",
        "For reference, the majority baseline, which estimates the dialogue-acts of all utterances to be information-provision, has 12% accuracy.",
        "Question-type classification: We use the question taxonomy by Nagata et al. (2006) because it was derived by analyzing questions from the general public and therefore covers diverse questions.",
        "The taxonomy has 23 question types under five main categories: name, quantity, explanation, yes-no, and other.",
        "Since some types could be too specific, by merging similar ones, we shrinked the 23 types into 13: name-other, name-person, quantity-other, quantity-date, quantity-period, quantity-money, yes-no, explanation-reason, explanation-definition, explanation-method, explanation-reputation, explanation-association, and other.",
        "Using an in-house data set of about 48K questions annotated with the 13 types, we trained a logistic-regression-based classifier that achieves a classification accuracy of 92.5% by a five-fold cross validation.",
        "The majority baseline that always classifies to name-other has 39.5% accuracy.",
        "Center-word extraction: We define a center-word as a noun phrase (NP) that denotes the topic of a conversation.",
        "We hypothesize that an utterance has at most one NP suitable for a center-word.",
        "To extract an NP from an utterance, we use conditional random fields (Lafferty et al., 2001); NPs are extracted directly from a sequence of words without creating a parse tree.",
        "For the training and testing, we prepared 10K sentences with center-word annotation.",
        "Here, the sentences were those randomly sampled from the open-domain conversation corpus (See Section 2.2).",
        "The feature template uses words, part-of-speech (POS) tags, and semantic categories of current and neighboring words.",
        "The extraction accuracy is 83.4% by a five-fold cross validation.",
        "This module has access to the context.",
        "When there are already center-words (represented by a stack) in the context, the center-word of the current utterance is placed at the top of the stack.",
        "PAS analysis and anaphora resolution: In PAS analysis, predicates and their arguments are detected.",
        "A predicate can be a verb, adjective, or copular verb, and the arguments are NPs associated with cases in case grammar.",
        "As cases, we use standard cases ga (nominative), wo (accusative), ni (dative) as well as de (locative/instrumental), to (with), kara (source), made (goal).",
        "We use the PAS analyzer described in (Imamura et al., 2009; Imamura et al., 2014a; Imamura et al., 2014b).",
        "The analyzer works statistically by ranking NPs in the context using supervised learning with an obligatory case information dictionary and a large-scale word dependency language model.",
        "For the ranking, NPs in the current utterance and the center-words in the context are considered.",
        "Also considered are the special NPs ?I?, ?YOU?, ?exog (exophora general)?, and ?null?.",
        "Here, ?exog?",
        "means that there should be some argument for a case but it is missing in the context, and ?null?",
        "means that no argument is required for a case.",
        "When arguments are filled with NPs from the context, this means that zero pronoun resolution (a type of anaphora resolution) has been performed.",
        "The analyzer is reported to have an accuracy of 57-62% for ga, wo, and ni cases for dialogue data (Imamura et al., 2014b).",
        "When a zero pronoun is resolved, the NP used for the resolution is placed at the top of the center-word stack because such an elided NP is grounded among the conversational participants and is likely to be the focus of conversation (Walker et al., 1994).",
        "2.2 Dialogue Control Modules We have two modules for dialogue control.",
        "The next dialogue-act estimation module roughly decides the next user utterance on the intention level (dialogue-act level).",
        "The utterance ranking module ranks utterance candidates (See Section 2.3 for how utterance candidates are created) by a coherence criterion.",

        "We use these dialogue snippets as references (positive examples).",
        "We also create counter-references (pseudo negative examples) by swapping the last utterance of each snippet with a randomly selected one from the dialogue from which the snippet was taken.",
        "This is similar to how Barzilay and Lapata (2008) created their training data for their coherence models.",
        "We then train a ranker by ranking SVM (Joachims, 2002) in the same manner as (Higashinaka and Isozaki, 2008).",
        "The ranker is trained so that references are ranked higher than counter-references.",
        "Following Lapata (2003), who used pairs of words for sentence ordering, we use, as features, the pairs of words, POS-tags, and semantic categories between the last utterance and each of the previous utterances.",
        "For example, when the last utterance U l has k words and one of its previous utterance U p has m words, we create k ?m features by combining them.",
        "This feature generation is done also for POS-tags and semantic categories and is iterated over all previous utterances.",
        "We trained two rankers using 2 and 3 for N. When N is 2, we have 124,213 snippets.",
        "When N is 3, we have 120,717.",
        "By using four-fifths of the data for training and using the remaining one-fifth for testing, the rankers achieve 66.7% and 66.4% accuracies for N=2 and N=3, respectively.",

        "We only use 2 and 3 for N here since a larger N could lead to the explosion of features.",

        "Versatile: This module receives the system's next dialogue-act and returns utterances randomly chosen from the list of utterances for that dialogue-act.",
        "To create lists for dialogue-acts, we first extracted frequent utterances for each dialogue-act in the LoD corpus.",
        "Then, we selected context-independent utterances for the dialogue-act.",

        "The rules here include common exchanges of utterances (e.g., compliments of the season) as well as those to evade weak topics, changes of topics, and innocuous utterances.",
        "Then, he used the open-domain conversation corpus (with 10% held out for evaluation as we describe later) to extract two consecutive utterances and coded them as rules, making the first utterance the matching pattern and the second utterance the output sentence (called a template in AIML).",
        "This process involved replacing certain words with asterisks (wildcard) to widen the coverage of patterns and modifying templates if necessary.",
