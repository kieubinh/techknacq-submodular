        "Compounding is a phenomenon that is studied extensively in linguistic literature.",
        "Also in computational linguistics, compounds are enjoying more and more attention ( ?",
        "O S?eaghdha, 2008; Hendrickx et al., 2013).",
        "Compounding is a very productive word formation.",
        "Already 2-year-olds are able to form new words by using compounds consisting of two morphemes (Clark, 1981).",
        "As a consequence, compounds are a very common word type but many occur with a very low token count.",
        "In an analysis of the German APA corpus, Baroni et al. (2002) found that almost half (47%) of the word types were compounds.",
        "At the same time, the compounds accounted for a small portion of the overall token count (7%), which suggests that many of them are rare (83% of the compounds had a corpus frequency of 5 or lower).",
        "For English, more than half of the two-noun compounds (e.g., car park) in the BNC occur exactly once (Kim and Baldwin, 2006).",
        "The high productivity of compounds makes compositional approaches to automatic processing indispensable: listing all possible compounds in a dictionary would be as infeasible as listing all possible adjective-noun combinations.",
        "Even for compound nouns that occur 10 times or more in the BNC, static English dictionaries provide only 27% coverage (Tanaka and Baldwin, 2003).",
        "Being abundant as a phenomenon but scarce in terms of individual examples (the combination of high type frequency and low token frequency) makes the analysis of these compound nouns particularly problematic for statistical techniques that need high token frequencies to make accurate predictions.",
        "Data sparsity is expected to lead to low performance.",
        "However, the correct analysis of compound nouns is important for a number of NLP tasks, for example in machine translation (Bouillon et al., 1992; Rackow et al., 1992; Johnston and Busa, 1999; Navigli et al., 2003).",
        "The accurate translation of compounds is non-trivial, because we find a large amount of variation in the way languages deal with compounding.",
        "Some languages such as German use closed compounding (i.e., they create one-word compounds, e.g., Todesstrafe (death penalty)) whereas others do not.",
        "In Romance languages, such as French, compounds are not as productive, instead postmodifying prepositional phrases (e.g., peine de mort) and adjectives (peine capitale) are used to construct complex nominals.",
        "Another challenge in compound translation is due to the fact that the amount of underspecification in compound surface structure varies between languages.",
        "For example, whereas English leaves the compound relation (i.e., the semantic relation between two components, e.g., N 2 made of N 1 as in iron door) ",
        "1047 covert, in French we find prepositions that correlate with the relation type (Girju, 2007; Celli and Nissim, 2009).",
        "Chocolate cake, cake made of chocolate, is translated with gateau au chocolat, whereas wedding cake, cake made for a wedding, is gateau de marriage.",
        "The first aim of this study is to extract a large database of compounds and their translations in context from a parallel corpus.",
        "This database will serve multiple purposes.",
        "For example, it will be used to study compounding across different languages, and we will exploit the cross-lingual variation for compound processing.",
        "In the second part of this paper, we will show a case study of how the extracted database can be used for analysing the structure of noun phrases, more specifically, we exploit spelling variations across languages for bracketing three-noun compounds (3NCs) such as air traffic control, which could be indicated as LEFT bracketing using the German phrase Kontrolle des Luftverkehrs (control of air traffic).",
        "Compounding is an important subject of study in theoretical linguistics, because it constitutes a continuum from fully compositional to idiosyncratic word formation and is found at the boundary between words and phrases.",
        "However, there is virtually no reliable and universally accepted criterion for distinguishing compounds from phrases or other types of word formations, as stated by Lieber and Stekauer (2009).",
        "They discuss reasons for the complexity that arises when defining noun compounds, that we will review in the next section.",
        "They do, however, also describe a number of linguistic tests, each with their own advantages and drawbacks.",
        "This brings us to the second aim of this paper.",
        "We propose an iterative method that, in absence of a clear definition, validates several linguistic tests on corpus data and continuously refines the definition.",
        "We show how we use linguistic tests to extract compounds automatically and vice versa how the results of this extraction can shed new lights on linguistic theory about compoundhood.",
        "The multilingual nature of our data (we work on parallel corpora) has the additional advantage that a cross-lingual definition can be sought by studying compounds in context and their translation across several languages.",
        "In Section 2, we discuss the problem of defining noun compounds (NCs) as described by Lieber and Stekauer (2009) and present an iterative method for defining and extracting English NCs starting with an initial definition based on some linguistic tests.",
        "In Section 3, we present our method for extracting English NCs and their translations to several languages from a parallel corpus using a set of extraction rules.",
        "An experimental setup and results are presented in Section 4.",
        "In Section 5 we show in a case study of bracketing three-noun compounds how our database serves for exploiting multilingual spelling variations.",
        "Section 6 describes related work and finally Section 7 concludes.",
        "2 Iterative method for the definition and extraction of noun compounds In this section, we outline the controversy of defining compoundhood as described in linguistic literature.",
        "We present several linguistic tests for distinguishing compounds and show how we implement some linguistic criteria that can be used for identification and extraction of noun compounds and how these constitute the initial definition.",
        "2.1 Definition of compounds and linguistic criteria When we seek to find a working definition of noun compounds (NCs), we have to keep in mind that not only the definition but also the existence of such an NC is controversial.",
        "Lieber and Stekauer (2009) present a discussion about this controversy sketched below.",
        "While Bauer (2003) defines a compound as a ?formation of a new lexeme by adjoining two or more lexemes?, Marchand (1967) argues that there is no compounding word formation at all.",
        "Instead, he uses the word formation EXPANSION, which combines prefixed words like reheat with such as steamboat using the criterion of a free head.",
        "Lieber and Stekauer (2009) highlight two reasons for the complexity that arises when defining noun compounds.",
        "Firstly, in some languages, constituents are not free but stems or roots.",
        "For example, the Slovak term r?ychlovlak (express train) starts with the stem of the adjective r?ychly (as in the phrase r?ychly vlak (fast train)).",
        "The lack of inflection in English makes compositional and phrasal structures (i.e., fast train as phrase or as compound (express train)) collapse.",
        "Secondly, sometimes phrases and derivations cannot be distinguished from compounds.",
        "While blackboard (in opposition to a black board) can be classified as compound without dissent, a tomato bowl that just happens to hold tomatoes might not be regarded as a 1048 single lexeme (conforming Bauer's (2003) definition).",
        "So, the only way for getting a suitable definition is to find solid criterions.",
        "Although Lieber and Stekauer (2009) come to the conclusion that there is almost no reliable and universally accepted criterion, they mention several plausible tests.",
        "Compounds can be identified by prosody.",
        "While in the phrase black bird, the head (bird) is stressed, in the compound blackbird the stress is on the first syllable (black).",
        "A syntactic test mentioned by Lieber and Stekauer (2009) is inseparability, i.e., there must not be any element intervening a compound's components.",
        "While black bird can be understood as compound, black ugly bird is a phrase.",
        "Another promising syntactic criterion is the inability to modify the first element (i.e., the modifier) of a compound.",
        "In a phrase like social person, the first element (social) can be modified (i.e., very social person).",
        "This is not possible for compounds (e.g., very social policy).",
        "A last syntactic criterion, the inability to replace the second noun of a nominal compound with a proform such as one (e.g., black bird vs. black one), would need human support.",
        "A morphological criterion states that in compounds only the head is inflected.",
        "Although this assumption does not always hold (as shown in examples like overseas investor or girls club), this seems to be a promising criterion when investigating inflectional behaviour in aligned languages that show strong morphology, e.g., French.",
        "Conversely, determining compoundhood on the basis of spelling is discarded by Lieber and Stekauer (2009).",
        "English orthography is highly inconsistent: some compounds usually occur as a closed compound (e.g., football), some occur hyphenated and some occur as an open compound (e.g., waiting room or rule of law).",
        "For some compounds, several spellings are possible (e.g., flowerpot, flower-pot, flower pot or pot of flowers).",
        "In our study, we focus on written language as given in a parallel corpus.",
        "Since we do not have any speech data, we cannot use any phonological features such as stress for the extraction of noun compounds.",
        "For the inability to replace the second noun of a nominal compound with a proform, we cannot assess if the meaning of a sentence would have changed (e.g., We see blackbirds vs. We see black ones).",
        "In this paper, we focus on criteria that are most suitable with the current data.",
        "Although Lieber and Stekauer (2009) exclude spelling as a reliable criterion of compoundhood, we take it as starting point.",
        "The parallel corpus we use for the extraction includes several languages.",
        "Spelling variations between languages can be exploited to find compounds (e.g., social policy can be written as one word in German (Sozialpolitik)).",
        "We account for the English spelling variations by defining part-of-speech (PoS) patterns that cover most plausible spellings.",
        "These PoS patterns treat each noun or adjective as a compound's component and thus, this way of extraction inherently implements the criterion of inseparability.",
        "We exploit multilingual evidence in terms of cross-lingual differences in spelling to extract compounds.",
        "Diverse language families have different declinations of forming a closed compound.",
        "While languages like Danish and German prefer closed compounding, English and Romance languages like Spanish use open compounds.",
        "It is this spelling variation that we base our first set of extraction rules on with the aim of having a set of English NCs and their translations in up to 9 European languages.",
        "We will show that cross-lingual closed compounding is a promising feature for extracting English NCs.",
        "The inability to modify the first element of a compound seems to be a promising test.",
        "Since there are many linguistic factors that have to be taken into account (e.g., morphological agreement in gender, number or case), we plan to include this criterion for several languages and any combination of contextual modifier and potential noun compound.",
        "We will implement this and further morphological criteria in future work.",
        "2.2 Initial definition for compound extraction With a focus on multilingual validity, we adapt the definition of Bauer (2003) to our multilingual setting.",
        "Inspired by Behagel's (1909) First Law (?Elements that belong close together intellectually will also be placed close together?",
        "), we associate a closed compounding language realising an English word sequence as a closed NC with an indicator for compoundhood: Initial definition: A noun compound is a nominal composition of several lexemes that are represented as a one-word expression in some of the languages studied.",
        "This definition covers both target single words (e.g., blackbird translates to German as Amsel) or target 1049 closed compounds (e.g., football match translates to Dutch as voetbalwedstrijd).",
        "We are aware of the fact that this definition leads to some controversial cases for English word sequences including pre-nominal adjectives.",
        "While some of them are commonly accepted such as social policy (German: Sozialpolitik), others are less accepted such as strong wind (German: Starkwind) or small car (German: Kleinwagen).",
        "This is not an unwanted side-effect.",
        "On the contrary, these controversial cases are an essential part of the iterative process we described, as they will foster linguistic discussions.",
        "Although the German Starkwind can be regarded as partly compositional, it is frequently used with a concrete definition (in contrast to the phrase starker Wind) and cannot occur in a context violating this definition, as shown in the table below.",
        "1 a) Als Starkwind wird meist eine Windst?arke zwischen 6 und 7 Beaufort bezeichnet.",
        "1 b) A {strong wind} usually refers to a wind force of 6-7 Beaufort.",
        "2 a) Am Samstag weht ein starker Wind mit Windst?arke 8 von Westen.",
        "2 b) On Saturday, a strong wind with wind force 8 will blow from the west.",
        "3 a) *Am Samstag weht ein Starkwind mit Windst?arke 8 von Westen.",
        "3 b) On Saturday, a *{strong wind} with wind force 8 will blow from the west.",
        "3 Multilingual extraction of NCs This method is based on the initial definition for compound extraction described in Section 2.2 and can be adapted in succeeding iterations.",
        "English NCs are extracted from a parallel corpus that includes English and some closed compounding languages (e.g., German).",
        "3.1 Preprocessing the parallel data In Section 4.1, we describe the tokenization, sentence alignment, word alignment and PoS tagging we apply to the parallel data in more detail.",
        "In addition, we perform a binary compound splitter on each word that is tagged as a noun by following a variant of the methods of Stymne et al., (2013).",
        "This unsupervised splitter checks each noun for all possible segmentations into at most two components with at least two characters.",
        "All possible segmentations are scored with the geometric mean of the components?",
        "frequencies in the parallel corpus.",
        "The highest-scored segmentation (possibly with no split point) is used.",
        "3.2 Preselection of English noun compounds using PoS patterns As a basis for the extraction of English NCs, we use a set of possible English PoS sequences that can constitute an NC.",
        "These PoS patterns account for the various ways of composing English NCs and for the inseparability property as described in Section 2.1.",
        "Table 1 lists all plausible PoS patterns for bipartite and tripartite NCs with some examples (cf. the Penn Treebank tag set (Marcus et al., 1993)).",
        "For all examples in Table 1, we found translations to a closed compound in German, which satisfies our initial definition described in Section 2.2, e.g., overall recovery rate has been translated to Gesamtr?uckforderungsquote.",
        "Although the larger the number of components, the sparser the number of (correct) extractions, we create a regular expression for PoS patterns that cover English NCs with n components (where 2 ?",
        "n ?",
        "10).",
        "This regular expression combines all possible combinations of observed NC types.",
        "In the next step, we will filter noise, that occurs mostly in longer word sequences.",
        "3.3 Noise filters The selection of English NCs and their translations is based on automatic preprocessing, which leads to some noise due to false PoS tags or flaws in word alignment.",
        "With increasing word sequence length, the amount of noise increases.",
        "We apply several filters on each preselected NC and on their alignments to all other languages in the corpus and keep only those that pass all filters.",
        "3.3.1 PoS filters 1.",
        "Two filters are applied to all languages: we disqualify word sequences including nouns or adjectives that (1) consist of only one character or (2) are contained in a stop list 1 .",
        "1 ranks.nl/stopwords 1050 PoS pattern Example Bipartite noun compounds NN marketplace NN NN death penalty JJ NN structural policy NN POS NN children's development NN IN NN fall in population NN IN DT NN concussion of the brain Tripartite noun compounds NN NN NN energy security goal JJ NN NN overall recovery rate NN IN NN IN NN income per head of population Regular expression for 2?10 components NN ((IN (DT)?|POS))?",

        "Then, to account for PoS tagging errors in English, we collect all words and their PoS tags in the parallel corpus.",

        "3.3.2 Word alignment filter Shortcomings in word alignment quality are remedied with three word alignment filters.",
        "1.",
        "We truncate extraneous words (i.e., determiners, prepositions and (ad)verbs) from the border of the word sequence (adjectives are removed from the right border for Germanic languages and from the left border for Romance languages).",
        "2.",
        "We disqualify the word sequence as being phrasal if it contains two consecutive nouns with verbs or adjectives in between or if the nouns are more than ?",
        "tokens apart from each other.",
        "When analysing many instances of Romance phrases aligned to an English noun compound, we observed that ?",
        "= 3 is the maximum token distance two nominal components can be apart (usually separated by preposition or preposition+determiner).",
        "If the word sequence is qualified as phrasal, we add determiners and prepositions that occur in the context between the nouns, otherwise the word sequence remains unchanged.",
        "3.",
        "We remove the word sequence if it does not contain at least one noun.",
        "The resulting set of English word sequences that conform to the regular expression in Table 1 and their aligned and filtered word sequences are stored as a set of m-tuples of word sequences.",
        "Subsequently, we will refer to this set as the basic set.",
        "The basic set still contains English word sequences that do not comply with our initial definition for compound extraction (Section 2.2), i.e., that are not aligned to a closed compound.",
        "In the next step, we apply a restrictor to all NCs in the basic set and keep only those instances that pass the restrictor.",
        "1051 3.4 Closed compound restrictor An English word sequence is considered to be an NC if it is represented as a one-word expression in some of the closed compounding languages (e.g., Dutch, German, Swedish, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ").",
        "Given a parallel corpus with n > 1 closed compounding languages, this definition leaves space for investigating the degree of crosslingual closed compounding (deg closed ) which is necessary for optimal extraction quality (i.e., optimal precision and recall).",
        "Because the rules described in Section 3.3.2 still leave some word alignment errors (i.e., English word sequences that are aligned to only a part of the true translation), a single compounding language realising the English word sequence as one word (i.e., deg closed = 1) might not be restrictive enough.",
        "The closed compound restrictor with deg closed ?",
        "i retains only English word sequences that are aligned to at least i one-word expressions in the aligned closed compounding languages.",
        "We will refer to this restrictor as CCR(i) and to the resulting data set as closed compound(i).",
        "4 Experiments for NC Extraction 4.1 Setup Data and preprocessing.",
        "We use the 7th release of the Europarl corpus 2 .",
        "Although the Europarl corpus comprises 21 European languages, the amount of common data they cover is rather small.",
        "This means, the more languages we use, the smaller the amount of common data.",
        "In order to get a good trade-off between cross-lingual coverage and language variation exploitation, we decided on a set of 10 languages: English, the closed compounding languages Danish, Dutch, German and Swedish, as well as Greek and the Romance languages French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish.",
        "Instead of preprocessing the parallel corpus on our own, we exploit the already preprocessed Europarl resource of OPUS 3 (Tiedemann, 2012).",
        "This preprocessed resource is PoS tagged using TreeTagger (Schmid, 1995) for English, Dutch, German, French, Italian and Spanish and the Hunpos 4 tagger for Danish, Portuguese and Swedish.",
        "We additionally tagged the Greek data using the MATE 5 tagger.",
        "The sentence alignment provided by OPUS is restricted to language pairs.",
        "As we need a sentence representation that is parallel in all 10 languages, we apply the OPUS sentence aligner (with English as pivot) on our language set and extract a total of 884,164 parallel sentence representations.",
        "The word alignment information provided by OPUS was also based on language pairs.",
        "This means, the sentence-wise token indices has to be adapted to our updated sentence representation (which is different due to a larger language set).",
        "In OPUS, the word alignment tool GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) has been used with the symmetrisation heuristics (grow-diag-final-and (Koehn et al., 2007)).",
        "4.2 Evaluation procedure and scoring In order to compare the added value in terms of recall and precision of each closed compound restrictor (i.e., CCR(1) to CCR(4)), we randomly select 50 accepted and 50 rejected English word sequences for each restrictor.",

        "The first result is that using only a PoS-based method leads to a very poor extraction accuracy (38%).",
        "For the applications of the closed compound restrictors, the result is that increasing deg closed means increasing precision but decreasing recall in NC extraction.",
        "The reason for this is that an aligned closed NC is generally a sufficient condition for an English NC (except for controversial cases such as strong wind) but not a necessary condition (i.e., a true English NC may be aligned to only periphrastic constructions).",

        "Each phrase pattern contains a complex unit that is separated from the rest, e.g., a closed NC or a combination of adjective and single noun.",
        "For each pattern, we know what is the head and what is the modifier: the first phrase pattern contains only one nominal component, that can be identified as head.",
        "For the other patterns, the order is: head, FC, modifier.",
        "Based on the assumption that the aligned head corresponds to the English head, we can infer the English bracketing from the complexity of the aligned head.",
