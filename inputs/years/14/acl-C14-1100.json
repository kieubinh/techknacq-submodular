        "Definiteness is a morphosyntactic property of noun phrases (NPs) associated with semantic and pragmatic characteristics of entities and their discourse status.",
        "Lyons (1999), for example, argues that definite markers prototypically reflect identifiability (whether a referent for the NP can be identified by the discourse participants or not); other aspects identified in the literature include uniqueness of the entity in the world and whether the hearer is already familiar with the entity given the context and preceding discourse (Roberts, 2003; Abbott, 2006).",
        "While some morphosyntactic forms of definiteness are employed by all languages?namely, demonstratives, personal pronouns, and possessives?languages display a vast range of variation with respect to the form and meaning of definiteness.",
        "For example, while languages like English make use of definite and indefinite articles to distinguish between the discourse status of various entities (the car vs. a car vs. cars), many other languages?including Czech, Indonesian, and Russian?do not have articles (although they do have demonstrative determiners).",
        "Sometimes definiteness is marked with affixes or clitics, as in Arabic.",
        "Sometimes it is expressed with other constructions, as in Chinese (a language without articles), where the existential construction can be used to express indefinite subjects and the ba-construction can be used to express definite direct objects (Chen, 2004).",
        "Aside from this variation in the form of (in)definite NPs within and across languages, there is also variability in the mapping between semantic, pragmatic, and discourse functions of NPs and the (in)definites expressing these functions.",
        "We refer to these as communicative functions of definiteness, following Bhatia et al. (2014).",
        "Croft (2003, pp. 6?7) shows that even when two languages have access to the same morphosyntactic forms of definiteness, the conditions under which an NP is marked as definite or indefinite (or not at all) are language-specific.",
        "He illustrates this by contrasting English and French translations (both languages use definite as well as indefinite articles) such as: (1) He showed extreme care.",

        "This paper develops supervised classifiers to predict communicative function labels for English NPs using lexical, morphological, and syntactic features.",
        "The contribution of our work is in both the output of the classifiers and the models themselves (features and weights).",
        "Each classifier predicts communicative function labels that capture aspects of discourse-newness, uniqueness, specificity, and so forth.",
        "Such functions are useful in a variety of language processing applications.",
        "For example, they should usually be preserved in translation, even when the grammatical mechanisms for expressing them are different.",
        "The communicative function labels also represent the discourse status of entities, making them relevant for entity tracking, knowledge base construction, and information extraction.",
        "Our log-linear model is a form-meaning mapping that relates syntactic, lexical, and morphological features to properties of communicative functions.",
        "The learned weights of this model can, e.g., generate plausible hypotheses regarding the form-meaning relationship which can then be tested rigorously through controlled experiments.",
        "This hypothesis generation is linguistically significant as it indicates new grammatical mechanisms beyond the obvious a and the articles that are used for expressing definiteness in English.",
        "To build our models, we leverage a cross-lingual definiteness annotation scheme (?2) and annotated English corpus (?3) developed in prior work (Bhatia et al., 2014).",
        "The classifiers, ?4, are supervised models with features that combine lexical and morphosyntactic information and the prespecified attributes or groupings of the communicative function labels (such as Anaphoric, Bridging, Specific in fig. 1) to predict leaf labels (the non-bold faced labels in fig. 1); the evaluation measures (?5) include one that exploits these label groupings to award partial credit according to relatedness.",
        "?6 presents experiments comparing several models and discussing their strengths and weaknesses; computational work and applications related to definiteness are addressed in ?7.",
        "1060 2 Annotation scheme The literature on definiteness describes functions such as uniqueness, familiarity, identifiability, anaphoric-ity, specificity, and referentiality (Birner and Ward, 1994; Condoravdi, 1992; Evans, 1977, 1980; Gundel et al., 1988, 1993; Heim, 1990; Kadmon, 1987, 1990; Lyons, 1999; Prince, 1992; Roberts, 2003; Russell, 1905, inter alia) as being related to definiteness.",
        "Reductionist approaches to definiteness try to define it in terms of one or two of the aforementioned communicative functions.",
        "For example, Roberts (2003) proposes that the combination of uniqueness and a presupposition of familiarity underlie all definite descriptions.",
        "However, possessive definite descriptions (John's daughter) and the weak definites (the son of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands) are neither unique nor necessarily familiar to the listener before they are spoken.",
        "In contrast to the reductionist approaches are approaches to grammaticalization (Hopper and Traugott, 2003) in which grammar develops over time in such a way that each grammatical construction has some prototypical communicative functions, but may also have many non-prototypical communicative functions.",
        "The scheme we are adopting for this work?the annotation scheme for Communicative Functions of Definiteness (CFD) as described in Bhatia et al. (2014)?assumes that there may be multiple functions to definiteness.",
        "CFD is based on a combination of these functions and is summarized in fig. 1.",
        "It was developed by annotating texts in two languages (English and Hindi) for four different genres?namely TED talks, a presidential inaugural speech, news articles, and fictional narratives?keeping in mind the communicative functions that have been associated with definiteness in the linguistic literature.",
        "CFD is hierarchically organized.",
        "This hierarchical organization serves to reduce the number of decisions that an annotator needs to make for speed and consistency.",
        "We now highlight some of the major distinctions in the hierarchy.",
        "At the highest level, the distinction is made between Anaphora, Nonanaphora, and Miscellaneous functions of an NP (the annotatable unit).",
        "Anaphora and Nonanaphora respectively describe whether an entity is old or new in the discourse; the Miscellaneous function is mainly assigned to various kinds of nonreferential NPs.",
        "The Anaphora category has two subcategories: Basic_Anaphora and Extended_Anaphora.",
        "Basic_Anaphora applies to NPs referring to entities that have been mentioned before.",
        "Extended_Anaphora applies to any NP whose referent has not been mentioned itself, but is evoked by a previously mentioned entity.",
        "For example, after mentioning a wedding, the bride, the groom, and the cake are considered to be Extended_Anaphora.",
        "Within the Nonanaphora category, a first distinction is made between Unique, Nonunique, and Generic.",
        "The Unique function applies to NPs whose referent becomes unique in a context for any of several reasons.",
        "For example, Obama can safely be considered unique in contemporary political discourse in the United States.",
        "The function Nonunique applies to NPs that start out with multiple possible referents and that may or may not become identifiable in a speech situation.",
        "For example, a little riding hood of red velvet in fig. 2 could be annotated with the label Nonunique.",
        "Finally, Generic NPs refer to classes or types of entities rather than specific entities.",
        "For example, Dinosaurs in Dinosaurs are extinct.",
        "is a Generic NP.",
        "Another important distinction CFD makes is between Hearer_Old for references to entities that are familiar to the hearer (e.g., if they are physically present in the speech situation), versus Hearer_New for nonfamiliar references.",
        "This distinction cuts across the two subparts of the hierarchy, Anaphora and Nonanaphora; thus, labels marking Hearer_Old or Hearer_New also encode other distinctions (e.g., Unique_Hearer_Old, Unique_Hearer_New, Nonunique_Hearer_Old).",
        "For further details on the annotation scheme, see fig. 1 and Bhatia et al. (2014).",
        "Because the ordering of distinctions determines the tree structure of the hierarchy, the same communicative functions could have been organized in a superficially different way.",
        "In fact, Komen (2013) has proposed a hierarchy with similar leaf nodes, but different internal structure.",
        "Since it is possible that some natural groupings of labels are not reflected in the hierarchy we used, we also decompose each label into fundamental communicative functions, which we call attributes.",
        "Each label type is associated with values for attributes Anaphoric, Bridging, Familiar, Generic, Predicative, Referential, Specific, and Unique.",
        "These attributes can have values of +, ?, or 0, as shown in fig. 1.",
        "For instance, with the Anaphoric 1061 Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child.",
        "Once she SAME_HEAD gave her DIFFERENT_HEAD a little riding hood of red velvet OTHER_NONREFERENTIAL NONUNIQUE_HEARER_NEW_SPEC , which suited her SAME_HEAD so well that she SAME_HEAD would never wear anything else QUANTIFIED ; so she SAME_HEAD was always called ?Little Red Riding Hood UNIQUE_HEARER_NEW .?",
        "Figure 2: An annotated sentence from ?Little Red Riding Hood.?",
        "The previous sentence is shown for context.",
        "attribute, a value of + applies to labels that can never mark NPs new to the discourse, ?",
        "applies to labels that can only apply if the NP is new in the discourse, and 0 applies to labels such as Pleonastic (where anaphoricity is not applicable because there is no discourse referent).",
        "3 Data We use the English definiteness corpus of Bhatia et al. (2014), which consists of texts from multiple genres annotated with the scheme described in ?2.",
        "1 The 17 documents consist of prepared speeches (TED talks and a presidential address), published news articles, and fictional narratives.",
        "The TED data predominates (75% of the corpus); 2 the presidential speech represents about 16%, fictional narratives 5%, and news articles 4%.",
        "All told, the corpus contains 13,860 words (868 sentences), with 3,422 NPs (the annotatable units).",
        "Bhatia et al. (2014) report high inter-annotator agreement, estimating Cohen's ?",
        "= 0.89 within the TED genre as well as for all genres.",
        "Figure 2 is an excerpt from the ?Little Red Riding Hood?",
        "annotated with the CFD scheme.",
        "4 Classification framework To model the relationship between the grammar of definiteness and its communicative functions in a data-driven fashion, we work within the supervised framework of feature-rich discriminative classification, treating the functional categories from ?2 as output labels y and various lexical, morphological, and syntactic characteristics of the language as features of the input x.",
        "Specifically, we learn two kinds of probabilistic models.",
        "The first is a log-linear model similar to multiclass logistic regression, but deviating in that logistic regression treats each output label (response) as atomic, whereas we decompose each into attributes based on their linguistic definitions, enabling commonalities between related labels to be recognized.",
        "Each weight in the model corresponds to a feature that mediates between percepts (characteristics of the input NP) and attributes (characteristics of the label).",
        "This is aimed at attaining better predictive accuracy as well as feature weights that better describe the form?function interactions we are interested in recovering.",
        "We also train a random forest model on the hypothesis that it would allow us to sacrifice interpretability of the learned parameters for predictive accuracy.",
        "Our setup is formalized below, where we discuss the mathematical models and linguistically motivated features.",
        "4.1 Models We experiment with two classification methods: a log-linear model and a nonlinear tree-based ensemble model.",
        "Due to their consistency and interpretability, linear models are a valuable tool for quantifying and analyzing the effects of individual features.",
        "Non-linear models, while less interpretable, often outperform logistic regression (Perlich et al., 2003), and thus could be desirable when the predictions are needed for a downstream task.",
        "1 The data can be obtained from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ytsvetko/definiteness_corpus.",

        "An important property of the random forests, in addition to being an effective tool in prediction, is their immunity to overfitting: as the number of trees increases, they produce a limiting value of the generalization error.",

        "4 As is standard practice with these models, bias parameters (which capture the overall frequency of percepts/attributes) are excluded from regularization.",

        "Structural.",
        "The structural percepts are: the path length from the head up to the root, and to the attached verb.",

        "Integer values were binarized with thresholding.",
        "Positional.",
        "These percepts are the token length of the NP, the NP's location in the sentence (first or second half), and the attached verb's position relative to the head (left or right).",
        "12 additional percept templates record the POS and lemma of the left and right neighbors of the head, governor, and attached verb.",
        "4.2.2 Contextual NPs When extracting features for a given NP (call it the ?target?",
