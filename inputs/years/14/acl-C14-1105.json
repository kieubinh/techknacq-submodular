        "We consider the problem of creating the best possible statistical machine translation (SMT) system for a specific domain when no parallel sample or training data from such domain is available.",
        "We assume that we have access to a collection of phrase tables (PT) and other models independently created from now unavailable corpora, and we receive a monolingual source language sample from a text source we would like to optimize for.",
        "For a MT provider to deliver a SMT system tailored to a customer's domain, a sample dataset is requested.",
        "In most cases, the customer is able to provide an in-domain mono-lingual sample from his operations.",
        "However, it is generally not feasible for the customer to provide the translations as well because the customer has to hire professional translators to do that.",
        "In such a scenario, the translations has to be generated by MT service provider itself by hiring human translators thus requiring an investment upfront.",
        "The methods proposed in this paper aim to avoid that by building a good quality pilot SMT system leveraging only sample mono-lingual source corpus, and previously trained library of models.",
        "This in turn postpones the task of generating in-domain parallel data to a later date when there is a commitment by the customer.",
        "Unavailability of the raw parallel data could derive from a trading model where data owners share intermediate-level resources like PTs, Reordering Models (RM) and Language Models (LM), but can not, or do not want to, share the textual data such resources were derived from.",
        "This particular scenario has been explained in (Cancedda, 2012).",
        "This scenario is similar to the multi-model framework studied in (Sennrich et al., 2013), with the additional challenge that no parallel development set is available.",
        "We build on the linear mixture model combination of the cited work, extending it to our more challenging environment: 1.",
        "We propose a new measure derived from the popular BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) to assess the fitness of a PT to cope with a given monolingual sample S. This measure is computed from n-gram statistics that can be easily extracted from a PT.",
        "2.",
        "We propose a new method for tuning the parameters of a log linear model that does not require an in-domain parallel development set, and yet achieves results very close to traditional tuning on parallel in-domain data.",
        "We present our proposed metric BLEU-PT and computation of multi-model in Section 2.",
        "The parameter estimation of log-linear parameters of the SMT system is described in Section 3.",

        "The challenging aspect in our scenario is the lack of in-domain parallel data, as well as absence of original parallel corpora corresponding to the library of models.",
        "This rules out the possibility of using metrics such as cross-entropy (Sennrich, 2012b) or LM-perplexity for computing the mixing coefficients.",

        "Our work is set in a scenario where no parallel development set is available for optimizing the interpolation coefficients.",
        "We have also observed that perplexity minimization is computationally intensive, requires aligned parallel development set, and the optimization time increases rapidly with increasing number of component models (for details, see Section 4.2).",
        "We propose a simple approach for computation of the mixing coefficients that relies on the similarity of each model with respect to the test set.",
        "The mixing coefficients are obtained by normalizing similarity values.",
        "The similarity between a model (phrase table) and a corpus is computed using the BLEU-PT metric proposed in the previous section.",

        "MERT (Och, 2003) and MIRA (Watanabe et al., 2007) are popular solution to compute an optimal weight vector by minimizing the error on a held-out parallel development set.",

        "In this paper we assume lack of a parallel development set, therefore the above methods cannot be used.",
        "Pecina et.",
        "al. (2012) showed that the optimized log-linear weight vector 1 of a SMT system does not depend as much on the actual domain of the development set (on which the system was optimized), as 1 Not to be confused with the mixing coefficients in a linear combination of model components.",
        "1115 on how ?distant?",
        "the relevant domain is from the domain of the training corpus used to build the SMT models.",
        "This is an important finding.",
        "It means that the weight vector can be modeled as a function of the distance/similarity between the in-domain development set and the model built from the training set.",
        "In this work, we learn this function from examples of previous parameter optimizations, using our BLEU-PT as a similarity metric.",
        "Once we have retrieved the most relevant PTs (translation and reordering models) from our library, and we have linearly interpolated them using normalized BLEU-PT, we use the learned model to estimate the optimal value of the log-linear weights, instead of optimizing them.",
        "In order to learn this mapping, we create a dataset of examples (pairs of the form <BLEU-PT, log-linear weight vector>, where weight vectors are normalized to ensure comparability across models) by performing repeated optimizations for out-domain models on a number of parallel development sets (see section 4 for more details of this data) using a traditional optimization method (MIRA in this work).",
        "Based on this dataset, the function of our interest can therefore be learnt using a supervised approach.",
        "We explore two parametric methods and a non-parametric method.",
        "We present these in Section 3.1, and 3.2 respectively.",
        "For a mono-lingual source in a new domain, the BLEU-PT can be computed, and then mapped to the appropriate weight vector using the methods presented below.",
        "3.1 Parametric Methods We considered two distinct parametric methods for estimating the mapping from model/corpus similarity into weight vectors.",
        "The first one makes the assumption that parameters can be estimated independently of one another, given the similarity, whereas the second tries to leverage known covariance between distinct parameters in the vector.",
        "3.1.1 Linear Regression Motivated by initial experiments highlighting strong correlation between BLEU-PT and optimal feature weights (see Section 5.1 below), we assumed here a simple linear relation of the form: ?",

        "Once these are available for all features, we can predict the log linear weights of any model given its BLEU-PT similarity to a monolingual source sample using Eq. 3.",
        "3.1.2 Multi-Task learning Optimal log-linear parameters might not be fully independent given BLEU-PT, especially since it is known that model features can be highly correlated.",
        "To account for correlation between parameter weights, we explore the use of multi-task lasso 2 (Caruana, 1997) where several functions corresponding to each parameter are learned jointly considering the correlation between their values observed in the training data.",
        "Multi-task lasso consists of a least square loss model trained along with a regularizer and the objective is to minimize the following: argmin w 1 2N ||X ?W ?",
