        "In statistical machine translation, the problem of reordering source language into the word order of the target language remains a central research topic.",
        "Statistical phrase-based translation models (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2003) are good at local reordering, or the reordering of words within the phrase, since the order is specified by phrasal translations.",
        "However, phrase-based models remain weak at long-distance reordering, or the reordering of the phrases.",
        "To improve the reordering of the phrases, two types of models have been developed.",
        "The first one is lexicalized reordering models (Tillman, 2004; Huang et al., 2005; Al-Onaizan and Papineni, 2006; Nagata et al., 2006; Xiong et al., 2006; Zens and Ney, 2006; Koehn et al., 2007; Galley and Manning, 2008; Cherry et al., 2012) which predict reordering by taking advantage of lexical information.",
        "The model in (Koehn et al., 2007) distinguishes three orientations with respect to the previous and the next phrase?monotone (M), swap (S) and discontinuous (D).",
        "For example, we can extract a phrase pair ?xiayou ||| the lower reach of?",
        "whose orientations with respect to the previous and the next phrase are D and S respectively, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "Such a model is simple and effective, and has become a standard component of phrase-based systems such as MOSES.",
        "Figure 1.",
        "Phrase orientations for Chinese-English translation.",
        "The other is a hierarchical phrase-based (HPB) translation model (Chiang, 2007) based on synchronous grammar.",
        "In the HPB model, a synchronous grammar rule may contain both terminals (words) and nonterminals (sub-phrases).",
        "The order of terminals and nonterminal are specified by the rule.",
        "For This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "1144 example, the translation rule <X xiayou, the lower reach of X > specifies that the translation of sub phrase X before ?xiayou?",
        "should be put after ?the lower reach of?.",
        "One problem with the HPB model is that the application of a rule is independent of the actual sub phrase.",
        "For example, the rule <X xiayou, the lower reach of X > will always swap the translation of X and ?xiayou?, no matter what is covered by X.",
        "This is an over-generalization problem.",
        "Much work has been done to solve this issue.",
        "For example, Zollmann and Venugopal (2006) annotate non-terminals by syntactic categories.",
        "He et al. (2008) proposes maximum entropy models which combine rich context information for selecting translation rules during decoding.",
        "Huang et al. (2010) automatically induce a set of latent syntactic categories to annotate nonterminals.",
        "These works alleviate the over-generalization problem by considering the content of X.",
        "In this paper, we try to solve it from an alternative view by modeling whether the phrases covered by X prefer the order specified by the rule.",
        "This has led us to borrow the lexicalized reordering model from the phrase-based model for the HPB model.",
        "We propose a novel lexicalized reordering model for hierarchical phrase-based translation and achieved a 0.6-1.2 BLEU point improvements for Chinese-English translation over a strong HPB baseline system.",
        "2 Related work In this section, we briefly review two types of related work which are a nonterminal-based lexicalized reordering models and a path-based lexicalized reordering model.",
        "Both of them calculate the orientation for HPB translation.",
        "2.1 Nonterminal-based lexicalized reordering models Xiao et al. (2011) proposed an orientation model for HPB translation.",
        "The orientation probability of a derivation is calculated as the product of orientation probabilities of all nonterminals except the root.",
        "In order to define the relative orders of nonterminals and their adjacent phrase, they expand the alignment in a rule to include both terminals and nonterminals.",
        "There may be multiple ways to segment a rule into phrases; they use the maximum adjacent phrase similar to Galley and Manning (2008).",
        "They significantly outperformed the HPB system on both Chinese-English and German-English translation.",
        "Xiao et al. (2011) use the boundary word feature of nonterminals without considering their internal structure.",
        "For example, in Figure 1, suppose nonterminal X1 is not the root node and the orientation probability of X1 will condition on ?zhe, xiayou, this, river?.",
        "In this paper, we will consider how the words covered by the nonterminal X1 are reordered.",
        "Rather than using ?xiayou?",
        "as a feature to determine the orientation of X1 with respect to the next phrase, we think the immediately translated source word ?huanghe?",
        "could be more informative through it is not on the boundary of X1 , since ?huanghe?",
        "is the exact starting point from where we search for the next phrase to translate.",
        "Huck et al. (2013) proposed a very effective phrase orientation model for HPB translation.",
        "The model is also based on nonterminal.",
        "They extracted phrase orientation probabilities from word-aligned training data for use with hierarchical phrase inventories, and scored orientations in hierarchical decoding.",
        "2.2 Path-based lexicalized reordering model The most recent related work is Nguyen and Vogel (2013).",
        "They map a HPB derivation into a discontinuous phrase-based translation path in the following two steps: 1) Represent each rule as a sequence of phrase pairs and non-terminals.",
        "2) The rules?",
        "sequences are used to find the corresponding phrase-based path of a HPB derivation and calculate the phrase-based reordering features.",
        "Figure 2.",
        "The phrase-based path of the derivation in Figure 1.",
        "1145 A phrase-based path is the sequence of phrase pairs, whose source sides covers the source sentences and whose target sides generated the target sentences from left to right.",
        "For example, the phrase-based path of the derivation in Figure 1 is shown in Figure 2.",
        "The phrase-based reordering features for the above phrase-based path are: >)is thisshi, zhe|<(log DPnext , >)of reachlower thexiayou,|<(log DPprevious , >)of reachlower thexiayou,|<(log SPnext , >)river yellow thehuanghe,|<(log SPprevious .",
        "Nguyen and Vogel (2013) achieved significant improvement over both phrase-based and HPB models on three language pairs respectively.",
        "One problem with the above work is that they did not use rules with unaligned source or target phrases.",
        "Though this can get faster and better Arabic-English translation, it leads to a 0.49 BLEU point loss for Chinese-English translation.",
        "Another problem with path-based model is: there are many forms of HPB rules which we cannot map into a reasonable sequence of phrase pairs and non-terminals.",
        "We will show this with an example derivation shown in Figure 3.",
        "The main difference between Figure 3 and Figure 1 is there is such a rule <fangzhi X, prevent X from> that a source phrase ?fangzhi?",
        "is aligned with a discontinuous target phrase ?prevent?from?.",
