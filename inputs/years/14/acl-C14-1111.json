        "Morfessor is a family of methods for learning morphological segmentations of words based on unannotated data.",

        "Our experiments show that while unsupervised FlatCat does not reach the accuracy of Categories-MAP, with semi-supervised learning it provides state-of-the-art results in the Morpho Challenge 2010 tasks for English, Finnish, and Turkish."

        "Morphological analysis is essential for automatic processing of compounding and highly-inflecting lan-guages, for which the number of unique word forms may be very large.",
        "Apart from rule-based analyzers, the task has been approached by machine learning methodology.",
        "Especially unsupervised methods that require no linguistic resources have been studied widely (Hammarstr?om and Borin, 2011).",
        "Typically these methods focus on morphological segmentation, i.e., finding morphs, the surface forms of the morphemes.",
        "For language processing applications, unsupervised learning of morphology can provide decent-quality analyses without resources produced by human experts.",
        "However, while morphological analyzers and large annotated corpora may be expensive to obtain, a small amount of linguistic expertise is more easily available.",
        "A well-informed native speaker of a language can often identify the different pre-fixes, stems, and suffixes of words.",
        "Then the question is how many annotated words makes a difference.",
        "One answer was provided by Kohonen et al. (2010), who showed that already one hundred manually segmented words provide significant improvements to the quality of the output when comparing to a linguistic gold standard.",
        "The semi-supervised approach by Kohonen et al. (2010) was based on Morfessor Baseline, the simplest of the Morfessor methods by Creutz and Lagus (2002; 2007).",
        "The statistical model of Morfessor Baseline is simply a categorical distribution of morphs?a unigram model in the terms of statistical language modeling.",
        "As the semi-supervised Morfessor Baseline outperformed all unsupervised and semi-supervised methods evaluated in the Morpho Challenge competitions (Kurimo et al., 2010a) so far, the next question is how the approach works for more complex models.",
        "Another popular variant of Morfessor, Categories-MAP (CatMAP) (Creutz and Lagus, 2005), models word formation using a hidden Markov model (HMM).",
        "The context-sensitivity of the model improves the precision of the segmentation.",
        "For example, it can prevent splitting a single s, a common English suffix, from the beginning of a word.",
        "Moreover, it can disambiguate between identical morphs that are actually surface forms of different morphemes.",
        "Finally, separation of stems and affixes in the output makes it simple to use the method as a stemmer.",
        "In contrast to Morfessor Baseline, the lexicon of CatMAP is hierarchical: a morph that is already in the lexicon may be used to encode the forms of other morphs.",
        "This has both advantages and drawbacks.",
        "1177 One downside is that it mixes the prior and likelihood components of the cost function, so that the semi-supervised approach presented by Kohonen et al. (2010) is not usable.",
        "1.1 Hierarchical versus flat lexicons From the viewpoint of data compression and following the two-part Minimum Description Length principle (Rissanen, 1978), Morfessor tries to minimize the number of bits needed to encode both the model parameters and the training data.",
        "Equivalently, the cost function L can be derived from the Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimate: ?",
        "?",
        "= argmax ?",
        "P(?",
        "|D) = argmin ?",
        "( ?",
        "log P(?)?",
        "log P(D | ?)",
        ") = argmin ?",
        "L(?,D), (1) where ?",
        "are the model parameters, D is the training corpus, P(?)",
        "is the prior of the parameters and P(D | ?)",
        "is the data likelihood.",
        "In context-independent models such as Morfessor Baseline, the parameters include only the forms and probabilities of the morphs in the lexicon of the model.",
        "Morfessor Baseline and Categories-ML (CatML) (Creutz and Lagus, 2004) use a flat lexicon, in which the forms of the morphs are encoded directly as strings: each letter requires a certain number of bits to encode.",
        "Thus longer morphs are more expensive.",
        "Encoding a long morph is worthwhile only if the morph is referred to frequently enough from the words in the training data.",
        "If a certain string, let us say segmentation, is common enough in the training data, it is cost-effective to have it as a whole in the lexicon.",
        "Splitting it into two items, segment and ation, would double the number of pointers from the data, even if those morphs were already in the lexicon.",
        "The undersegmentation of frequent words becomes evident especially if the training data is a corpus instead of a list of unique word forms.",
        "In contrast, Morfessor CatMAP applies a hierarchical lexicon, which makes use of the morphs that are already in the lexicon.",
        "Instead of encoding the form of segmentation by its 12 letters, we could just encode the form with two references to the forms of the morphs segment and ation.",
        "This may also cause errors, for example encoding station with st and ation.",
        "The lexicon of Morfessor CatMAP allows but does not force hierarchical encoding for the forms: each morph has an extra parameter that indicates whether it has a hierarchical representation or not.",
        "The problem of oversegmentation, as in st + ation, is solved using the morph categories.",
        "The categories, which are states of the HMM, include stem, prefix, suffix, and a special non-morpheme category.",
        "The non-morpheme category is intended to catch segments that do not fit well into the three proper morph categories because they are fragments of a larger morph.",
        "In our example, the morph st cannot be a suffix as it starts the word, it is unlikely to be a prefix as it directly precedes a common suffix ation, and it is unlikely to be a stem as it is very short.",
        "Thus the algorithm is likely to use the non-morpheme state.",
        "The hierarchy is expanded only up to the level in which there are no non-morphemes, so the final analysis is still station.",
        "Without the hierarchy, the non-morphemes have to be removed heuristically, as in CatML (Creutz and Lagus, 2004).",
        "A hierarchical lexicon presents some challenges to model training.",
        "For a standard unigram or HMM model, if you know the state and emission sequence of the training data, you can directly derive the maximum likelihood (ML) parameters of the model: a probability of a morph is proportional to the number of times it is referred to, conditional on the state in the HMM.",
        "But if the lexicon is partly hierarchical, also the references within the lexicon add to the reference counts, and there is no direct way to find the ML parameters even if the encoding of the training data is known.",
        "Similarly, semi-supervised learning cannot be accomplished simply by adding the counts from an annotated data set, as it is not clear when to use hierarchy instead of segmenting a word directly in the data.",
        "Moreover, for a flat lexicon, the cost function divides into two parts that have opposing optima: the cost of the data (likelihood) is optimal when there is minimal splitting and the lexicon consists of the words in the training data, whereas the cost of the model (prior) is optimal when the lexicon is minimal and consists only of the letters.",
        "In consequence, the balance of precision and recall of the segmentation boundaries can be directly controlled by setting a weight for the data likelihood.",
        "Tuning this hyper-parameter is a very simple form of supervision, but it has drastic effects on the segmentation results 1178 (Kohonen et al., 2010).",
        "A direct control of the balance may also be useful for some applications: Virpioja et al. (2011) found that the performance of the segmentation algorithms in machine translation correlates more with the precision than the recall.",
        "The weighting approach does not work for hierarchical lexicons, for which changing the weight does not directly affect the decision whether to encode the morph with hierarchy or not.",
        "1.2 Morfessor FlatCat In this paper, we introduce a new member to the Morfessor family, Morfessor FlatCat.",
        "As indicated by its name, FlatCat uses a flat lexicon.",
        "Our hypothesis is that enabling semi-supervised learning is effective in compensating for the undersegmentation caused by the lack of hierarchy.",
        "In particular, semi-supervised learning can improve modeling of suffixation.",
        "In the examined languages, suffixes tend to serve syntactic purposes, such as marking case, tense, person or number.",
        "Examples are the suffix s marking tense and person in she writes and number in stations.",
        "Thus the suffix class is closed and has only a small number of morphemes compared to the prefix and stem categories.",
        "As a consequence, a large coverage of suffixes can be achieved already with a relatively small annotated data set.",
        "The basic model of morphotactics in FlatCat is the same as in the CatML and CatMAP variants: a hidden Markov model with states that correspond to a word boundary and four morph categories: stem, prefix, suffix, and non-morpheme.",
        "As in CatML, we apply heuristics for removal of non-morphemes from the final segmentation.",
        "However, because FlatCat uses MAP estimation of the parameters, these heuristics are not necessary during the training for controlling the model complexity, but merely used as a post-processing step to get meaningful categories.",
        "Modeling of morphotactics improves the segmentation of compound words, by allowing the overall level of segmentation to be increased without increasing the number of correct morphs used in incorrect positions.",
        "As the benefits of semi-supervised learning and improved morphotactics are likely to complement each other, we can expect improved performance over the semi-supervised Morfessor Baseline method.",
        "By experimental comparison to the previous Morfessor variants, we are able to shed more light on the effects of using an HMM versus unigram model for morphotactics, using a hierarchical versus flat lexicon, and exploiting small amounts of annotated training data.",
        "2 FlatCat model and algorithms Morfessor FlatCat uses components from the older Morfessor variants.",
        "Instead of going through all the details, we refer to the previous work and highlight only the differences.",
        "Common components between Morfessor methods are summarized in Table 1.",
        "As a generative model, Morfessor FlatCat describes the joint distribution P(A,W | ?)",
        "of words and their analyses.",
        "The wordsW are observed, but their analyses, A, is a latent variable in the model.",
        "An analysis of a word contains its morphs and morph categories: prefix, stem, suffix, and non-morpheme.",
        "As marginalizing over all possible analyses is generally infeasible, point estimates are used during the training.",
        "The likelihood conditioned on the current analyses is P(D |A, ?)",
        "= |D| ?",
        "j=1 P(A j | ?).",
        "(2) If m i are the morphs in A j , c i are the hidden states of the HMM corresponding to the categories of the morphs, and # is the word boundary, P(A j | ?)",
        "is P(c 1 |#) |A j | ?",
        "i=1 [ P(m i | c i ) P(c i+1 | c i ) ] P(# | c |A j | ).",
        "(3) Morfessor FlatCat applies an MDL-derived prior designed to control the number of non-zero parameters.",
        "The prior is otherwise the same as in Morfessor Baseline, but it includes the usage properties from Morfessor CatMAP: the length of the morph and its right and left perplexity.",
        "The perplexity measures describe the predictability of the contexts in which the morph occurs.",
        "The emission probability of 1179 Morfessor method Component Baseline CatMAP CatML FlatCat Lexicon type Flat Hierarchy Flat Flat Morphotactics Unigram HMM HMM HMM Estimation MAP MAP ML MAP Semi-supervised Implemented Not implemented Not implemented Implemented Table 1: Overview of similarities and differences between Morfessor methods.",
        "a morph conditioned on the morph category, P(m | c), is calculated from the properties of the morphs similarly as in CatMAP.",
        "2.1 Training algorithms The parameters are optimized using a local search.",
        "Only a part of the parameters are optimized in each step: the parameters that are used in calculating the likelihood of a certain part, unit, of the corpus.",
        "Units vary in complexity, from all occurrences of a certain morph to the occurrences of a morph bigram whose context fits to certain criteria.",
        "The algorithm tries to simultaneously find the optimal segmentation for the unit and the optimal parameters consistent with that segmentation: (A, ?)",
        "= argmin OP(A,?)",
        "{ L(?,A,D) } .",
        "(4) The training operators OP define the units changed by the local search and the alternative segmentations tried for each unit.",
        "There are three training operators: split, join and resegment, analogous to the similarly named stages in CatMAP.",
        "The split operator is applied first.",
        "It targets all occurrences of a specific morph in the corpus simultane-ously, attempting to split it into two parts.",
        "The whole corpus is processed by sorting the current morphs by length from shortest to longest.",
        "The second operator attempts to join morph bigrams, grouped by the position of the bigram in the word.",
        "The position grouped bigram counts are sorted by frequency, from most to least common.",
        "Finally, resegmenting uses the generalized Viterbi algorithm to find the currently optimal segmentation for one whole word at a time.",
        "This operator targets each corpus word in increasing order of frequency.",
        "The heuristics used in FlatCat to remove non-morphemes from the final segmentation are the fol-lowing: All consequent non-morphemes are joined together.",
        "If the resulting morph is longer than 4 characters, it is accepted as a stem.",
        "All non-morphemes preceded by a suffix and followed by only suffixes or other non-morphemes are recategorized as suffixes without joining with their neighbors.",
        "If any short non-morphemes remain, they are joined either to the preceding or following morphs (the latter only for those in the initial position).",
        "2.2 Semi-supervised learning Kohonen et al. (2010) found that semi-supervised learning of Morfessor models was not effective by only fixing the values of the analysis A for the annotated samplesD A .",
        "Their solution was to introduce corpus likelihood weights ?",
        "and ?, one for the unannotated data set and one for the annotated data set.",

        "We use the same scheme for FlatCat.",
        "The likelihood of the annotated data is calculated using the same HMM that is used for the unannotated data.",
        "The morph properties are estimated only from the unannotated data.",
