        "concern.",
        "In query-focused summarization, one query is firstly proposed at the beginning of the documents.",
        "Then according to the given query and its influence on sen-tences, a ranking score is assigned to each of the sentences and higher ranked sentences are picked into a summary.",
        "Among existing approaches, graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithms have been shown to be an effective way to impose a query's influence on sentences (Zhou et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2004; Wan et al., 2007).",
        "Specifically, a weighted network is constructed where each sentence is modeled as a node and relationships between sentences are modeled as directed or undirected edges.",
        "With the assumption that a query is the most important node, initially, a positive score is assigned to the query and zero to the remaining nodes.",
        "All nodes then spread their ranking scores to their nearby neighbors via the weighted network.",
        "This spreading process is repeated until a global stable state is achieved, and all nodes obtain their final ranking scores.",
        "The primary disadvantage of existing learning method is that sentences are ranked without considering topic level information.",
        "As we know, a collection of related documents usually covers a few different topics.",
        "For example, the specific event ?Quebec independence?",
        "may involve the topics such as ?leader in independence movement?, ?referendum?, ?related efforts in independence movement?",
        "and so on.",
        "It is important to discover the latent topics when summarizing a document collection, because sentences in an important topic would be more important than those talking about trivial topics (Hardy et al., 2002; Harabagiu and Lacatusu, 2005; Otterbacher et al., 2005; Wan and Yang, 2008).",
        "The topic models (Blei et al., 2003) offer a good opportunity for the topic-level information modeling by offering clear and rigorous probabilistic interpretations over other existing clustering techniques.",
        "So far, LDA has been widely used in summarization task by discovering topics latent in the document collections (Daum√© and Marcu, 2006; Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009; Jin et al., 2010; Mason and Charniak, 2011; Delort and Alfonseca, 2012).",
        "However, as far as we know, how to combine topic information and semi-supervised learning into a unified framework has seldom been exploited.",
        "In this paper, inspired by the graph-based semi-supervised strategy and topic models, we propose a two-layer (i.e. sentence layer and topic layer) graph-based semi-supervised learning approach for ?",

        "By using two revised versions of LDA topic model (See Section 2), our approach naturally models the relations between topics and sentences, and further use these relations to construct the two-layer graph.",
        "Experiments on the TAC datasets demonstrate that we can improve summarization performance under the framework of two-layer graph-based semi-supervised learning.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes our LDA based topic models, W-LDA and S-LDA.",
        "Section 3 presents the construction of the two-layer graph and the semi-supervised learning and the experimental results are provided in Section 4.",
        "Then, Section 5 describes related work on query-focused multi-document summarization and topic modeling techniques and we conclude this paper in Section 6.",
        "2 Topic Modeling 2.1 Model Description As discussed in Section 1, a collection of documents often involves different topics related to a specific event.",
        "The basic idea of our summarization approach is to discover the latent topics and cluster sentences according to the topics.",
        "Inspired by (Chemudugunta et al., 2006) and (Li et al., 2011), we find 4 types of words in the text: (1) Stop words that occur frequently in the text.",
        "(2) Background words that describe the general information about an event, such as ?Quebec?",
        "and ?independence?.",
        "(3) Aspect words talking about topics across the corpus.",
        "(4) Document-specific words that are local to a single document and do not appear across different corpus.",
        "Similar ideas can also be found in many LDA based summarization techniques (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009; Li et al., 2011; Delort and Alfonseca, 2012).",
        "Stop words can easily be filtered out by a standard list of stopwords.",
        "We use a background word distribution ?",
        "B to model vocabularies commonly used in the document collection.",

        "[K + 1,K + M ].",
        "Each word w is modeled as a mixture of background topics, document-specific topics or aspect topics.",
        "We use a latent parameter y w to denote whether it is a background word, a document-specific word or an aspect word.",
        "y w is sampled from a multinomial distribution with parameter pi.",
        "2.2 W-LDA and S-LDA We describe two models: a word level model W-LDA and a sentence level S-LDA.",
