        "These dates are then ranked by their ?salience?",
        "in the set of documents.",
        "The idea behind the notion of salient date is that if a date is important in a sub-corpus (Lucene output), then we can say that important events occurred at this date, and then that these events must appear in a timeline.",
        "In practice, salience is mostly defined by the number of occurrences of the date in the documents from the search engine, as well as some other features that are used to feed a machine learning classifier.",
        "The output of this salient date algorithm is then a ranked list of dates, where each date comes together with a set of sentences that contain this date and that are relevant to the query.",
        "We call temporal clusters these sets of sentences linked to a specific date (see Figures 2 and 3).",

        "It aims at ranking events based on these two factors.",
        "The problem of information redundancy will be addressed by a reranking step in ?6.",
        "Our principal motivation is that an event has more chance to be selected into a timeline if it is both relevant to the topic and important, or in other words, salient w.r.t other related events.",
        "The concepts of relevance and salience are realized in our ranking function by considering term proximity and date frequency, respectively.",
        "Previous works in event detection normally formalize events as individual terms or syntactic patterns, which facilitates the use of text content.",
        "Instead, as our method utilizes both time and text content, we come to a formalization of an event as a pair of its mentioned date and its one-sentence description.",
        "Given an input query, the aim of ranking is to select the most relevant and salient events.",
        "The relevance of an event is calculated by vector-based query similarity, and augmented by the average relevance of its containing thematic cluster.",
        "Salience is contributed by date frequency and averaged term weight.",

        "Those terms, in turn, tend to occur frequently on a date.",

        "We use a set of 91 chronologies manually written by expert journalists from the AFP news agency (Figure 1) as golden reference summaries for evaluation.",
        "As our generated timelines are extendable, we need to define its length for evaluation.",
        "Considering the characteristics of reference summaries, we decide that if a reference summary of a timeline contains k events, we appropriately use only the k highest ranked events in the timeline for evaluation (Figure 5).",

        "7.1 Evaluate Date Selection We evaluate the dates selected by timelines returned by our system.",
        "The purposes of this evaluation are two-fold: i) Since time (as date in our case) is an essential dimension of chronological timeline, it is necessary to evaluate the time selected by timelines; ii) The novelty of this work w.r.t Kessler et al. (2012) is the mixture of content and temporal information.",
        "We need to show empirical evidences that at least, this mixture does not break the performance of date selection.",
        "The dates occurring in a timeline are compared with the dates occurring in its reference timeline using Mean Average Precision (MAP) metric.",
        "It should be noted that by using MAP@k as evaluation metric, a date with higher rank has more impact than another date with lower rank.",
        "We use two systems presented in Kessler et al. (2012), named as DFIDF and ML in Table 1, for comparison as follows: ?",
        "DFIDF is an unsupervised system solely relying on date frequency with a tfidf-like scoring function.",
        "This method uses the AFP corpus, the same as the one used in our work.",
        "As the AFP corpus is temporally analyzed, the method indexes all the occurrences of dates in the corpus.",

        "As shown in Table 1, our method is close to ML.",
        "This result is encouraging as ML requires training data; and on the other hand, our system is not designed to directly solve the task of date selection.",
        "As expected, our system beats the unsupervised system DFIDF by a large margin.",
        "This superiority shows that the mixture of temporal information and content leads to an improvement on date selection over using only the former.",
        "7.2 Evaluate Summary Generation In order to evaluate timelines as text summaries, we ignore dates and consider all the entries in a timeline as one summary.",
        "We use ROUGE metric (Lin, 2004) to evaluate generated timelines against reference summaries.",
        "The following baselines are implemented (Table 2): In DFIDF ?",
        ", salient dates are taken from the outputs of the DFIDF system described in previous section.",
        "Each salient date is equivalent to a cluster containing all the events happening in that date.",
        "We then select the event the most relevant to the query, i.e. the event with the highest Lucene score, as representative of that salient date.",
        "Note that consequently, DFIDF ?",

        "Furthermore, RaRE outperforms RaRE-no-rerank, which shows that reducing redundancy by reranking improves the performance of summary generation.",
        "8 Conclusion and Future Work We presented a two-step inter-cluster ranking algorithm for event selection.",
        "The rank step sorts events based on their salience and query relevance.",
        "The event scoring function is based on both date frequency induced from temporal analyzed texts and term weighting induced from contents to reflect these two factors.",
        "The rerank step allows to reduce information redundancy by using inter-sentence dependency between the descriptions of events happening in the same time period (i.e. the same date in this work).",
        "Ranking based on sentences may be sensitive to sparsity.",
        "In the future, we will expand local contexts, for instance, to neighboring sentences, to acquire richer textual representation of events.",
        "One remaining issue is that reference chronologies, written by the journalists, are very subjective, and that we have only one example of chronology per topic.",
        "In the future, we will conduct a manual evaluation in order to complete results from this automatic evaluation.",
        "With the help of a validation interface, journalists will be provided ranked list of events w.r.t.",
        "their queries.",
        "They will then be able to select and edit the events that they wish to validate for their future timelines.",
        "Such an interface will both help journalists to produce new timelines, and bring a new evaluation methodology for our system.",
