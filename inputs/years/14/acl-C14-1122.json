        "This area of research recently has received a significant amount of attention (Zettle- moyer and Collins, 2005; Kate and Mooney, 2006; Wong and Mooney, 2006; Lu et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2012b).",
        "Consider these example sentence-semantics pairs: English: Which states have points that are higher than the highest point in Texas ?",

        "In the typical setting, the semantic parser learns from a collection of such sentence-semantics pairs a model that can parse novel input sentences into their respective semantic representations.",
        "Such semantic representations can then be used to interact with certain downstream components to perform interesting tasks.",
        "For example, retrieving of answers from an underlying database, or performing certain actions based on the generated executable semantic instructions.",
        "Note that in the training data, although complete sentence-semantics pairs are given, specific word-level semantic information is not explicitly provided.",
        "The model therefore needs to automatically learn such latent mappings between natural language words/phrases and semantic units.",
        "One natural assumption is that the semantics exhibit certain restricted structures, such as the recursive tree structures.",
        "Under such an assumption, one can convert the second semantics appeared above as the tree structure illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "More details about such tree structured representations will be given in Section 2.1.",
        "Currently, researchers only focused on the semantic parsing task under a single language setting where the input is a sentence from one particular language.",

        "Researchers resorted to performing context-dependent semantic parsing to alleviate such an issue (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2009).",
        "On the other hand, researchers have successfully exploited parallel texts for improved word-level semantic processing (Chan and Ng, 2005).",
        "This is because words from different languages that convey the same semantics can be used to disambiguate each other's semantics.",
        "In fact, texts from different languages that convey the same semantic information becomes increasingly available nowadays.",
        "Web crawlers such as Google and Yahoo!",
        "are able to rapidly aggregate a large volume of news stories every day.",
        "One crucial fact is that many such news articles written in different languages are actually all discussing the same underlying story and therefore convey similar or identical semantic information.",
        "To build better automatic systems for improved natural language understanding, it is therefore helpful to develop algorithms that can simultaneously process the underlying semantic information associated with all these documents coming from different language sources together.",
        "For example, consider the following example taken from the multilingual version of the dataset, which shows semantically equivalent sentences from three different languages and their corresponding semantics: English: What rivers do not run through Tennessee ?",

        "As a step towards the above-mentioned goal, this work focuses on the development of an automated system that is capable of simultaneously parsing semantically equivalent natural language texts in different languages into their underlying semantics.",
        "Specifically, in this work, we first introduce a new variant of a semantic parsing model under an existing framework.",
        "This new variant can be used together with other models for jointly making semantic parsing predictions, leading to an improved multilingual semantic parsing system.",
        "We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new variant through experiments.",
        "Although bilingual parsing has been extensively studied in fields such as statistical machine translation (Wu, 1997; Chiang, 2007), to the best of our knowledge, bilingual or multilingual semantic parsing that focuses on parsing sentences from multiple different languages into their formal semantic representations has not yet been studied.",
        "We present the very first work on performing multilingual semantic parsing that simultaneously parses semantically equivalent sentences from multiple different languages into their semantics.",
        "We believe this line of work can potentially lead to further developments and advancements in areas such as multilingual semantic processing and semantics-based machine translations (Jones et al., 2012a).",
        "2 Background 2.1 Semantics Researchers have focused on various semantic formalisms for semantic parsing.",
        "Popular examples include the tree-structured semantic representations (Wong and Mooney, 2006; Kate and Mooney, 1292 QUERY : answer(RIVER) ?RIVER : exclude(RIVER, RIVER) RIVER : traverse(STATE) STATE : stateid(STATENAME) STATENAME : ( ?",

        "2006), the lambda calculus expressions (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Wong and Mooney, 2007), and dependency-based semantic representations (DCS) (Liang et al., 2013).",
        "In this work, we specifically focus on the tree-structured representations for semantics.",
        "Each semantic representation consists of semantic units as its tree nodes, where each semantic unit is of the following form: m a ?",
        "?",
        "a : p ?",
        "(?",
        "b ?)",
        "(1) Herem a is used to denote a complete semantic unit, which consists of its semantic type ?",
        "a , its function symbol p ?",
        ", as well as a list of types for argument semantic units ?",
        "b ?",
        "(here ?",
        "means 0, 1, or 2; we assume there are at most two arguments for each semantic unit).",
        "In other words, each semantic unit can be regarded as a function which takes in other semantic representations of specific types as arguments, and returns a new semantic representation of a particular type.",
        "For example, in Figure 1, the semantic unit at the root has a type QUERY, a function name answer, and a single argument type RIVER.",
        "2.2 Related Work Substantial research efforts have focused on building monolingual semantic parsing systems.",
        "We survey in this section several of them.",
        "WASP (Wong and Mooney, 2006) is a model motivated by statistical synchronous parsing-based machine translation (Chiang, 2007), which essentially casts the semantic parsing problem as a phrase-based translation problem (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "KRISP (Kate and Mooney, 2006) makes use of Support Vector Machines with string kernels (Lodhi et al., 2002) to recursively map contiguous word sequences into semantic units to construct a tree structure.",
        "The SCISSOR model (Ge and Mooney, 2005) performs integrated semantic and syntactic parsing.",
        "The model parses natural language sentences into semantically augmented parse trees whose nodes consist of both semantic and syntactic labels and then builds semantic representations based on such augmented trees.",
        "The hybrid tree model (Lu et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2009), whose code is publicly available, makes the assumption that there exists an underlying generative process for jointly producing both the language and semantics.",
        "The model employs efficient dynamic programming algorithms for learning a distribution over the latent hybrid trees which jointly encode both language and semantics.",
        "An example hybrid tree representation is shown in Figure 2.",
        "Jones et al. (2012b) recently proposed a framework that performs semantic parsing with tree transducers.",
        "The model learns representations that are similar to the hybrid tree structures using a generative process under a Bayesian framework.",
        "Besides these approaches, recently there are also several works that take alternative learning approaches for semantic parsing which do not require annotated semantic representations (Poon and Domingos, 2009; Clarke et al., 2010; Goldwasser et al., 2011; Liang et al., 2013; Artzi and Zettle-moyer, 2013).",
        "Most of such approaches rely on either weak supervision or certain forms of indirect supervision.",
        "Some of these works also focus on optimizing specific downstream tasks rather than the semantic parsing task itself.",

        "Thus they can be viewed as two different ways of generating such a pair from the joint generative process.",
        "We note there also exist various multilingual or cross-lingual semantic processing works.",
        "Most of such works focus on semantic role labeling(SRL), the task of recovery of shallow meaning.",
        "Examples include multilingual semantic role labeling (Bj?orkelund et al., 2009), multilingual joint syntactic and semantic dependency parsing (Henderson et al., 2013), and cross-lingual transfer of semantic role labeling models (Kozhevnikov and Titov, 2013).",
        "Researchers also looked into exploiting semantic information for bilingual processing such as machine translations (Chan et al., 2007; Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Jones et al., 2012a).",
        "In this work, we focus on the task of multilingual semantic parsing under the setting where the input consists of semantically equivalent sentences from multiple different languages, and the outputs are formal semantic representations.",
        "We specifically focus on the hybrid tree model, a state-of-the-art framework for semantic parsing.",
        "We first make an extension to the model, and investigate methods for performing such a multilingual semantic parsing task by aggregating a few variants of the models under such a framework.",
        "3 Approach In this section, we first discuss the hybrid tree model of Lu et al. (2008), and introduce a novel extension.",
        "Next we discuss the approach used for multilingual semantic parsing.",
        "3.1 The Hybrid Tree Model For a given n-m pair (where n is a complete natural language sentence, and m is a complete semantic representation), the hybrid tree model assumes that both n and m are generated from an underlying generative process in a top-down, left-to-right, level-by-level, recursive manner.",
        "The joint generative process for the pair results in a new tree-structured representation called a hybrid tree, which consists of natural language words as leaves, and semantic units as internal nodes.",
        "There are three types of model parameters involved in the generative process.",

        "are used for generating one semantic unit from its parent semantic unit.",
        "The hybrid pattern parameters (?)",
        "are used for deciding how natural language words and semantic units are organized together to form the next level of the nodes of the hybrid tree structure.",
        "The emission parameters (?)",
        "are used for generating natural language words from its corresponding semantic unit.",
        "For a given n-m pair, there are multiple possible hybrid trees that can jointly represent such a pair.",
        "See Figure 3 for two possible hybrid trees that contain the same n-m pair.",
        "Consider the first example hybrid tree illustrated there.",

        "Similar definitions can be given to the patterns XwYw and w, where X and Y refer to the first and second child semantic unit, respectively.",
        "The symbols X and Y appear in emission parameters are used to denote placeholders for the first and second child semantic unit, respectively.",
        "The hybrid tree model then focuses on the learning of these model parameters from the training data using maximum likelihood estimation.",

        "h P (n i ,m i ,h; ?, ?, ?)",
        "(3) Since the correct hybrid tree associated with n-m pair is unknown, we marginalize over the hidden variable h. The model parameters will then be estimated using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977).",
        "Specifically, an inside-outside style algorithm (Baker, 2005) is used where an additional layer of dynamic programming algorithms are used for efficient inference (Lu et al., 2008).",
        "The complexity of the inference algorithm is O(mn 3 ), where m is the size of the semantic representation (number of semantic units), and n is the number of words in the input sentence.",
        "Note that the generation of natural language words involves the context ?.",
        "Specifically, if the context is empty, the model is regarded as the unigram model.",
        "If the context is the previously generated word, the model is called a bigram model.",
        "For example, consider the generation of the natural language word w 4 in the left hybrid tree in Figure 2.",
        "The probability for generating this word is ?",
        "(w 4 |m b ) and ?",
        "(w 4 |m b , w 3 ), under the unigram and the bigram model, respectively.",
        "In Lu et al. (2008), the mixgram model (an interpolation between the unigram model and the bigram model) was also considered when parsing novel sentences, which yielded a better performance.",
        "Once the model parameters are learned, we will be able to use them to parse novel sentences.",
        "Specifi-cally, for each novel input sentence, we first find the most probable hybrid tree that contains the sentence n, and then extract its internal nodes to form the semantic representation.",
        "Efficient dynamic programming algorithms similar to the ones used for training can also be employed here.",
        "In addition, the algorithm can also be extended to support exact top-k decoding, which will be useful later for combining multiple lists of outputs with rank aggregation (to be discussed in Sec.",
        "3.3).",
        "3.2 The Backward Bigram Model One assumption associated with the original hybrid tree model is that nodes at each level of the hybrid tree are generated from the left to the right.",
        "An alternative assumption would be that the nodes at each level are generated in the reverse order ?",
        "from the right to the left.",
        "While this alternative assumption will not introduce any difference in the unigram model (since each node is generated from its respective parent semantic unit only, regardless of its context), such a new assumption will lead to a completely new generative process under the bigram assumption.",
        "To see this, again consider the emission probability for generating the word w 4 in the hybrid tree on the left of Figure 3.",
        "Under the assumption of our new model, the probability of generating this word is ?",
        "(w 4 |m b , w 5 ), since now the context ?",
        "becomes the word to the right of the current word.",
        "The parameter estimation and parsing (decoding) procedures are largely similar to those of the original bigram model, where similar efficient dynamic programming algorithms can be employed.",
        "3.3 Multilingual Semantic Parsing In multilingual semantic parsing, the input consists of multiple semantically equivalent sentences, each of which is from a different language.",
        "One approach for building such a multilingual semantic parsing system is to develop a joint generative process from which both the semantic representations and the sentences in different languages are generated simultaneously.",
        "However, building such a joint model is non-trivial.",
        "Typically, sentences from different languages exhibit very different syntactic structures and word orderings.",
        "It is also non-trivial to design efficient dynamic programming algorithms for this case where multiple languages are involved in the joint generative process.",
        "Furthermore, the difficulty of building such a joint generative model becomes higher as the number of input languages increases.",
        "1295 Previous research efforts show that it can be beneficial to learn individual models independently, and then combine the learned models only during the inference stage (Punyakanok et al., 2005; Chang et al., 2012).",
        "Motivated by this, we take the approach that learns a separate semantic parser for each different language first.",
        "Next, we combine these semantic parsers for different languages into a single multilingual semantic parser only during the inference stage.",
        "One common approach for combining different outputs from different systems is to perform majority voting based on optimal predictions from each parser.",
        "We first obtain the best output semantic representation from each individual semantic parser, and then count the number of occurrences for each possible output.",
        "The most frequent output semantic representation is returned as the final output of our system.",
        "Naturally, this approach is only applicable when there are at least three systems/models.",
        "An alternative approach is to allow each system to produce a ranked list of k most probable outputs, each is associated with a score.",
        "Our system then aggregates these ranked lists to select the best output.",
        "This problem is known as rank aggregation and has been extensively studied in fields such as data mining and information retrieval (Dwork et al., 2001; Gleich and Lim, 2011; Li, 2011).",
        "For our task, we first let each semantic parser (for each language) generate a ranked list of the top-k most probable outputs (hybrid trees) for the given input.",
        "Next, based these hybrid trees we find a ranked list of most probable semantic representations.",
        "Each such semantic representation is also associated with a score, which is the log-likelihood of the hybrid tree, i.e., logP (n,m,h).",
        "Note that for each semantic representation, we only consider the score associated with the most probable hybrid tree that contains such a semantic representation.",
        "We use the standard approach for combining two ranked lists with scores.",
        "Consider a ranked list from the j-th model/system that consists of n distinct items.",
        "Let's use s (j) i to denote the original score associated with the i-th semantic representation in the j-th ranked list.",
        "We normalize the score s (j) i in the following way to obtain the new score s?",

        "k=1 (s (j) k ?",
        "?",
        "(j) ) 2 Such new scores will then be used for aggregating the results to form a new ranked list.",
        "How do we find the best output from multiple lists?",
        "Two useful sources of information that we may use include: 1) the number of times each output appears in these lists; 2) the combined score ?",
        "j s?",
        "(j) for each output s. We believe the more frequent an output appears in these lists (i.e., more systems/models predict such an output in their top-k lists), the more likely it can be a good candidate.",
        "Therefore we first find the set of most frequent outputs, next from such a set we select the output with the highest overall score ?",

        "This is significantly higher than any other monolingual system's performance reported in the literature.",

        "Note that to date, no single system reported in the literature can dominate all other systems across all these languages on this dataset in terms of accuracy performance.",
        "We hypothesize that this is because semantic information conveyed by the sentences from a single language tends to be highly ambiguous, and various linguistic phenomenons can be difficult to capture under a monolingual setting for any existing monolingual semantic parsing system.",
        "The multilingual semantic parsing system introduced in this work, in con-trast, can exploit richer information from multiple languages to successfully disambiguate the semantics associated with the inputs for improved semantic parsing.",
        "5 Conclusions In this work, we focused on multilingual semantic parsing, the task of simultaneously parsing sentences from various different languages into their corresponding formal semantic representations.",
        "Our work is built on top of the hybrid tree framework where different generative process can be developed for jointly modelling the generation of both language and semantics.",
        "We first introduced a variant of the generative process, leading to a new semantic parsing model.",
        "Next we presented methods for combining and aggregating outputs from different models within the framework to build our multilingual semantic parsing system.",
        "Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches for such a task.",
