        "Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of online e-commerce business, e.g. Amazon and eBay, which raises the need for better storing, organizing and analyzing the large amount of product records.",
        "An important task is how to effectively link product records across multiple databases or websites.",
        "This task serves as a fundamental step for many applications.",
        "For example, it will be useful to provide entity-oriented search and product comparison analysis in eBay, where record linkage can help to unify the corresponding records (i.e. records from different sellers) given a product.",
        "Record linkage has been shown to be important in many fields, including biology (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970), database (Neiling, 2006) and text mining (Goiser and Christen, 2006; Bilenko and Mooney, 2003).",
        "In this paper, we mainly focus on the task of product record linkage for online e-commerce websites, but our method is easy to be extended to other data sources and tasks.",
        "Early studies on record linkage were mainly based on the classical probabilistic approach developed by Fellegi and Sunter (1969), furthermore it was improved by the application of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm (Winkler, 1988) and the use of approximate string comparison algorithms (Christen, 2006; Winkler, 2006).",
        "The early work was not flexible to incorporate rich information.",
        "The development of machine learning techniques in the late 1990s provides a new approach for record link-age, and it has become the mainstream methodology for this task.",
        "The task of record linkage is usually re-casted as the record pair classification problem, i.e. whether a record pair refers to the same entity or not (Elfeky et al., 2002; Neiling, 2006; Tejada et al., 2002; Nahm et al., 2002).",
        "Supervised methods can also be used to learn distance measures for approximate string comparisons (Bilenko and Mooney, 2003; ",
        "1311 Cohen et al., 2003).",
        "Although supervised techniques often achieve good linkage quality, they are largely limited by the availability of the training data.",
        "To address this problem, semi-supervised learning approaches aim to make good use of a small portion of labeled and a large amount of unlabeled data to build a better classifier (Yarowsky, 1995).",
        "Self-training is a commonly used algorithm for semi-supervised learning, where in each iteration the learner converts the most confidently predicted unlabeled examples of each class into labeled training examples.",
        "It has been successfully applied to many tasks, such as sentiment analysis (He and Zhou, 2011; Riloff et al., 2003) and object detection from images (Rosenberg et al., 2005).",
        "In this paper, we solve the task of product record linkage via a semi-supervised approach and adopt the flexible self-training framework for learning with little labeled data.",
        "We propose a novel variant of the self-training algorithm by incorporating the correlation existing in the data instances, which is rarely studied in previous studies.",

        "We mainly consider the confidence evaluation of the candidate positive instance.",

        "Usually, such techniques do not perform not as well as supervised approaches.",
        "Most recently, genetic programming (GP) (Koza et al., 1999) has also been utilized to the task of record linkage.",
        "GenLink (Isele and Bizer, 2012) is a GP-based supervised learning algorithm in order to learn linkage rules from a set of existing reference links, which also suffers from the problem of lack of labeled data.",
        "Ngomo and Lyko (2013) evaluated linear and boolean classifiers against classifiers 1312 computed by using genetic programming for the record linkage problem.",
        "Their experiments showed that both approaches did not perform well on real data.",
        "Some other studies exploit more complex constraints that include relationships between different entity types to link all types of entities in coordination (Bhattacharya and Getoor, 2007; Dong et al., 2005; On et al., 2007).",
        "The usage of such constraints can indeed help to get better linkage results, but is in many cases domain-dependent.",
        "We try to develop an approach which can be applicable across domains.",
        "In order to address the problem of limited labeled data, we mainly consider the semi-supervised approaches.",
        "There are rarely semi-supervised approaches specially for the record linkage problem.",
        "Some studies on improving self-training algorithms are related to our work.",
        "Self-training with editing (Li and Zhou, 2005) can help to reduce mislabeled pseudo training examples, and reserved self-training (Guan and Yang, 2013) is designed for handling imbalanced data.",
        "We have very different focus with theirs, i.e. incorporating the instance correlations into learning algorithms, which can applied to other self-training variants.",
        "3 Problem Definition In this section, we first introduce the preliminary related to our task.",
        "Then we formally define our studied task.",
        "Product record.",
        "A product record r is characterized by a referred product entity e and a set of attribute values V = {(v i )} i , where v i denotes the value of the ith attribute in r. We use r.e and r.V to index the product entity and attribute value set of the record r respectively.",
        "A product record corresponds to a unique product entity but a product entity can map to multiple product records across multiple databases.",
        "Attribute values are represented as strings, i.e. a sequence of characters.",
        "An attribute of a product might correspond to different descriptive text across websites.",
        "Product record linkage.",
        "The task of product record linkage is to judge whether two product records refer to the same product entity.",
        "Given two product records r and r ?",
        ", we aim to judge whether r.e is the same to r ?",
        ".e.",
        "Usually, r and r ?",
        "come from different product databases.",
        "Although different product databases can have different attributes for the same product and different attribute names for the same attribute, we make an assumption about the task: candidate record pairs share the same set of attributes.",
        "It is relatively easy to automatically identify common attributes and align attributes (H?arder et al., 1999; Rundensteiner, 1999; Hassanzadeh et al., 2013), which is not our focus in this paper.",
        "We mainly study product record linkage under the same set of attributes, and this assumption makes our study more focused.",
        "If r and r ?",
        "refer to the same product entity, denoted by r ?",
        "r ?",
        "; otherwise, we denote it by r 6?",
        "r ?",
        ".",
        "4 A General Machine Learning based Approach Given a product type, as we mentioned above, we assume that it corresponds to a specific set of attributes, and all the product records share the same set of attributes but possibly with different descriptive text for attribute values.",
        "In this section, we further present a general supervised approach with similarity features.",
        "4.1 Defining the similarity function Given two product records r and r ?",
        ", we can obtain the similarity between their descriptive text of an attribute by using a similarity function.",
        "The major intuition is that if two records refer to the same product, they should have similar text for the same attribute, i.e. the similarity function should return a large similarity value.",
        "Let f(?, ?)",
        "denote a similarity function, which takes two text strings and returns a similarity value within the interval [0, 1] for these two strings.",
        "As revealed in (Bilenko and Mooney, 2003), different attributes or fields may need different similarity functions to achieve best similarity evaluation.",
        "Thus, instead of fixing a single similarity function, we consider using the following widely used similarity functions: 1) Exact match; 2) Cosine similarity; 3) Jaccard coefficient; 4) K-Gram similarity (Kondrak, 2005); 5) Levenshtein similarity (Levenshtein, 1966); 6) Affine Gap similarity (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970).",
        "1313 4.2 The learning framework Based on these similarity functions, we propose a general learning framework for product record linkage by using similarity values of different fields as features.",
        "Given a product type, we assume that there are A attributes and K similarity functions.",
        "For two records r and r ?",
        ", we can obtain a similarity feature vector x = [x a,k ] A i=1 , K k=1 , which is indexed by an attribute and a similarity function: x a,k denotes the similarity of the ath attribute between r and r ?",
        "by using the kth similarity function.",
        "Furthermore, each feature vector x will correspond to a unique binary label y which indicates that r and r ?",
        "refer to the same product entity.",
        "Given a set of record pairs and their linkage labels {(x, y)}, we can learn a classifier which is able to predict the linkage label given the similarity feature vector of two records.",
        "To this end, we have reformulated the task of product record linkage as a binary classification problem.",
        "Any classifiers can be used for this task.",
        "In what follows, we will use instances and candidate pairs alternatively.",
        "5 Group based Self-Training In the above, we have presented a supervised learning approach for product record linkage.",
        "The approach is easy to apply in practice, however, the performance is largely limited by the availability of training data.",
        "For our current task, i.e. product record linkage, the generation of labeled data becomes even much harder: there are usually many product types and it is infeasible to create a large amount of labeled data for each type.",
        "Although it is difficult to obtain labeled data, we can easily obtain sufficient unlabeled data.",
        "Thus, in this paper, we study the task of product record linkage in a semi-supervised setting by leveraging both the learning ability of the classifiers and the usefulness of the large amount of unlabeled data.",
        "We propose a novel group based self-training algorithm for product record linkage.",
        "Before introducing our method, we first introduce the general self-training algorithm.",
        "5.1 The general self-training algorithm Self-training is a semi-supervised learning algorithm.",

        "After several iterations, it is expected to get a better classifier trained with both labeled data and pseudo labeled data.",

We can see that self-training is a wrapper algorithm by taking a classifier as the learning component, and it has three major steps in an iteration: 1) training classifier; 2) selecting pseudo labeled data; and 3) filling unlabeled data.",
        "Among the three steps, the most important step is the pseudo labeled data selection.",
        "Previously, the most commonly used method is to select the top confident instances of the classifier, and it is easy to see that the performance of self-training relies on the learning ability of the embedded classifier.",
        "5.2 Group confidence evaluation Recall that each instance is a pair of product records (r, r ? )",
