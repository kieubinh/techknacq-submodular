        "Since such a conventional model has many degeneracies in principle, a model with a category transition constraint is proposed, which is expressed by a novel penalty term in the objective function for training the model.",
        "The constraint is such that the sentiment of a partial sentence more likely propagates to the same sentiment of the complete sentence, rather than to another sentiment.",

        "Opinion classification is a task to classify sentences into given categories, according to sentiment, evalu-ation, or some opinion-related points of view.",
        "A practical implementation of opinion classification would be very useful for managing customer relationships at contact centers, etc.",
        "The classification problem may be binary or sometimes multi-class.",
        "One of the simplest modeling process is to use explicit bag features, such as word surfaces, polarity information from the sentiment dictionary, etc.",
        "Thanks to the good behavior of the Maximum Entropy or the Conditional Random Field (CRF) model, the maximum likelihood training is straight-forward, because the local optimum is always the global optimum.",
        "A challenge is to introduce into the model latent variables, which are not explicitly observable.",
        "The implicit modeling here is supposed to express ambiguities of natural language; the partial sentiment of the sentence is not determined until the end of the sentence.",
        "This paper presents in detail a probabilistic model with latent variables.",
        "The baseline model is a CRF model which is constructed dynamically according to the dependency parsed tree and which contains latent variables on the nodes that correspond to the chunked expressions (Nakagawa et al., 2010).",
        "The latent variables in the model are expected to convey a partial sentiment of the sentence, such as the sentiment of the dependency-parsed-subtree itself, which is not explicitly observable.",
        "Although this idea is attractive, it actually suffers from numerical instability.",
        "Our aim here is to find a way to deal with this problem.",
        "We tried using a global optimizer and investigated the behavior of the model, to ensure that this lack of stability comes from the degeneracy of the model.",
        "Our contribution to remedy this problem is as follows: We propose a model with a penalty on category transitions and compare several optimizers to train the model.",
        "We also confirm the stability of the model This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "1350 by applying it to the multi-class classification problem.",
        "We also investigate the origin of the degeneracy and how regularizer works for this type of classification model, to see the robustness of the model.",
        "2 Related Work Studies on opinion classification have more than a decade of history, including the pioneer work (Turney, 2002; Pang et al., 2002), followed by (Takamura et al., 2005; Brun, 2012).",
        "Our baseline model treats the sentiment of a partial sentence (Nakagawa et al., 2010); CRF with latent variables are constructed dynamically by the dependency structure tree of the input sentence.",
        "CRF model was first used in sequence labeling tasks (Lafferty, 2001).",
        "The model does not suffer from the label-bias problem as does the Maximum Entropy model, and its parameter estimation is well behaved with the help of a convex loss function.",
        "However, the convexity of the loss function of the CRF model does not hold anymore when there are unobserved data or latent variables (Sutton and McCallum, 2007).",
        "Latent variables were first used with CRF for the purpose of noun coreference (McCallum and Well-ner, 2005), and object recognition (Quattoni et al., 2005).",
        "Latent variables have been used to construct meaning representations in a process called grounded language acquisition (Liang et al., 2009).",
        "Another approach with hidden variables has been used an recursive auto-encoder to reduce the reliance on sentiment dictionaries (Socher et al., 2011).",
        "Machine learning, used for training such models, is largely based on the concept of numerical optimization.",
        "A general discussion of convex optimization can be found in (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004); it can be proven that the log-sum-exp type of a convex function is still a convex function.",
        "This is the situation with the CRF model without latent variables.",
        "Since convexity holds, the best solution to the problem would be a numerical local optimization.",
        "A general discussion of local optimization can be found in the textbook (Nocedal and Wright, 2006), who is one of the authors of the Limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) optimizer program.",
        "Many NLP application programs use probabilistic models, including this optimizer or its derived work.",
        "As the long name of the BFGS algorithm shows, the state-of-the-art local optimizer has a long history.",
        "Another textbook (Press et al., 2007) covers a global optimization algorithm, Simulated Annealing, originating from (Kirkpatrick et al., 1983).",
        "The main idea comes from the statistical physics of equilibrium; when a material is warm, its energy is distributed in excited states, whereas when it is cooled, it is very probable that the system will end in the ground state, which corresponds to the global minimum point of the energy.",
        "Previous studies on CRF with latent variables were trained either by setting the initial parameters randomly (Nakagawa et al., 2010), or by online training (McCallum and Wellner, 2005).",
        "As far as the author knows, this is the first study to impose a penalty between latent variables in CRF model, and to compare several optimization algorithms.",

        "The dash line indicates the log likelihood of the training data, for penalized and non-penalized models, which are almost identical.",
        "Secondly, in order to split degeneracy, only a small penalty is adequate, as illustrated in Figure 4; how less the penalty is, as long as it exists, the improvement remains.",
        "The horizontal axis is the strength of the proposed penalty, C penalty in eq.(13).",
        "The vertical axis is the classification accuracy.",
        "The dash line is a line fit for the accuracy by non-zero penalty.",
        "In general, such an extra constraint term for the original model may change the model itself, so, the less it is the better.",
        "That is the reason for decreasing accuracy when large penalty is used.",
        "The significant jump in the accuracy between zero and non-zero penalty strongly suggests the existence of degeneracies in the original model: Infinitesimally small penalty can lead to break those degeneracies.",
        "Local optima usually do not matter when regularizers are used in training.",
        "However, according to our experiments in this type of models, the conventional regularizers are not able to avoid such local optima no matter how strong they are.",
        "The reason the introduced penalty works well for this model is considered that the term works for excessive latent variables, which are not controlled by the ordinary regularizers.",
        "The ordinary regularizers only works for excessive number of explicitly observed parameters (i.e. fea-tures).",
        "If only a few latent variables are used, such a penalty is not necessary, just as a regularizer is not necessary for a small number of features.",
        "When the model is constructed dynamically and the number of latent variables grows, there appear a number of latent variables having excessive freedom, which need to be controlled.",

        "The constraint is such that the sentiment of a partial sentence tends to propagate toward the complete sentiment of the whole sentence, which is realized, in the objective function, by our novel term that penalizes, diminishing the change in the classification category.",
        "According to our experiments, the penalized latent dynamic model outperforms the conventional model, not only in binary but also in multi-class opinion classification.",
        "The comparison of optimizers strongly suggests that the degeneracies in the conventional model deteriorate the performance, and the proposed model solves such a defect.",
        "The numerical stability of training the proposed model is also confirmed.",
