        "Target-Polarity word (T-P) collocation extraction, which aims to extract the collocation of a target and its corresponding polarity word in a sentiment sentence, is a basic task in sentiment analysis.",
        "For example, in a sentiment sentence ?????????????",
        "(The camera has a novel appearance), ????",
        "(appearance) is the target, and ????",
        "(novel) is the polarity word that modifies ????",

        "According, ??",
        "?, ???",
        "(?appearance, novel?)",
        "is the T-P collocation.",
        "Generally, T-P collocation is a basic and complete sentiment unit, thus is very useful for many sentiment analysis applications.",
        "Features derived from syntactic parse trees are particularly useful for T-P collocation extraction (Ab- basi et al., 2008; Duric and Song, 2012).",
        "For example, the syntactic relation ?Adj ATT x Noun?, where the ATT denotes an attributive syntactic relation, can be used as an important evidence to extract the T-P collocation ??",
        "?, ???",
        "(?appearance, novel?)",
        "in the above sentiment sentence (Bloom et al., 2007; Qiu et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2013).",
        "However, one major problem of these approaches is the ?naturalness?",
        "of sentiment sentences, that is, such sentences are more natural or spontaneous compared with normal sentences, thus posing a challenge to syntactic parsers.",
        "Accordingly, many wrong syntactic features have been produced and these can further result in the poor performance of T-P collocation extraction.",
        "Taking the sentence in Figure 1(a) as an example, because the word ????",

        "problem, we can train a parser on sentiment sentences.",
        "Unfortunately, annotating such data will cost us a lot of time and effort.",

        "This idea is motivated by the observation that, current syntactic parsers usually perform accurately for short, simple and formal sentences, whereas error rates increase for longer, more complex or more natural and spontaneous sentences (Finkel et al., 2008).",
        "Hence, the improvement in syntactic parsing performance would have a ripple effect over T-P collocation extraction.",
        "For example, we can compress the sentence in Figure 1(a) into a shortened sentence in Figure 1(b) by removing the chatty part ????",
        "(fortunately).",
        "We can see that the shortened sentence is now well-formed (in Chinese) and its parse tree is correct, making it easier to accurately extract T-P collocation.",
        "Traditional sentence compression aims to obtain a shorter grammatical sentence by retaining important information (usually important grammar structure) (Jing, 2000).",
        "For example, the sentence ?Overall, this is a great camera.?",
        "can be compressed into ?This is a camera.?",
        "by removing the adverbial ?overall?",
        "and the modifier ?great?.",
        "However, the modifier ?great?",
        "is a polarity word and very important for sentiment analysis.",
        "Therefore, Sent Comp model for sentiment sentences is different from the traditional compression models, because it needs to retain the important sentiment information, such as the polarity word.",
        "Hence, using Sent Comp, the above sentence can be compressed into ?This is a great camera.?",
        "We regard Sent Comp as a sequence labeling task, which can be solved by a conditional random fields (CRF) model.",
        "Instead of seeking the manual rules on parse trees for compression, as in other studies (Vickrey and Koller, 2008), this method is an automatic procedure.",

        "This idea is based on the observation that there is a natural syntactic relationship between polarity words and targets owing to the fact that polarity words are used to modify targets.",
        "Furthermore, they also found that polarity words and targets themselves have relations in some sentiment sentences (Qiu et al., 2011).",
        "Based on this idea, in the double propagation method, we first used an initial seed polarity word lexicon and the syntactic relations to extract the targets, which can fall into a new target lexicon.",
        "Then we used the target lexicon and the same syntactic relations to extract the polarity words and to subsequently expand the polarity word lexicon.",

        "Nonetheless, the dependency features (09) have a negative on compression performance due to the specificity of compression for sentiment sentences.",
        "That is because the lower dependency parsing performance on sentiment sentences introduces many wrong dependency relations, which counteract the 7 In Table 3, although the performance of adding feeling is comparative to the basic system (Basic (01-04)), the system without feeling (All feeling (05), the last line) is worse than the system using all the features (All (01-08)).",

        "Note that, Sent Comp is the first step to process the corpus before T-P collocation extraction.",
        "The method for T-P collocation extraction was based on the state-of-the-art method proposed by Qiu et al. (2011) as described in Section 2. no Comp This refers to the system that only uses the T-P collocation extraction method and does not perform sentence compression as the first step.",
        "manual Comp This system manually compresses the corpus into a new one as the first step, and then applies the T-P collocation extraction method on the new compressed corpus.",
        "auto Comp This system uses Sent Comp as the first step to automatically compress the corpus into a new one, and then applies the T-P collocation extraction method on the new corpus.",
        "From the descriptions above, we can draw a conclusion that the performance of manual Comp can be considered as the upper bound for the sentiment sentence compression based T-P collocation extraction task.",
        "Table 4 shows the experimental results of the three systems on T-P collocation extraction for four product domains.",
        "Here, manual Comp can significantly (p < 0.01) improved the F-score by approximately 6%, 8 compared with no Comp.",
        "This illustrates that the idea of sentiment sentence compression is useful for T-P collocation extraction.",
        "Specifically, the proposed method can transform some over-natural sentences into normal ones, further influencing their final syntactic parsers.",
        "Evidently, because the T-P collocation extraction relies heavily on syntactic features, the more correct syntactic parse trees derived from the compressed sentences can help to increase the performance of this task.",
        "Compared with no Comp, the auto Comp system also yielded a significantly better results (p < 0.01) that indicated an improvement of 3.8% in the F-score, despite the fact that the automatic sentence compression model Sent Comp may wrongly compress some sentences.",
        "This demonstrates the usefulness of sentiment sentence compression step in the T-P collocation extraction task and further proves the effectiveness of our proposed model.",
        "8 We use paired bootstrap resampling significance test (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993).",
        "1366 Moreover, we can observe that the idea of sentence compression and our Sent Comp are useful for all the four product domains on T-P collocation extraction task, indicating that Sent Comp is domain adaptive.",
        "However, we can find a small gap between auto Comp and manual Comp, which indicates that the Sent Comp model can still be improved further.",
        "In the future, we will explore more effective sentence compression algorithms to bridge the gap between the two systems.",
        "5 Related Works 5.1 Sentiment Analysis T-P collocation extraction is a basic task in sentiment analysis.",
        "In order to solve this task, most methods focused on identifying relationships between targets and polarity words.",
        "In early studies, researchers recognized the target first, and then chose its polarity word within a window of size k (Hu and Liu, 2004).",
        "However, considering that this kind of method is too heuristic, the performance proved to be very limited.",
        "To tackle this problem, many researchers found syntactic patterns that can better describe the relationships between targets and polarity words.",
        "For example, Bloom et al. (2007) constructed a linkage specification lexicon containing 31 patterns, while Qiu et al. (2011) proposed a double propagation method that introduced eight heuristic syntactic patterns to extract the collocations.",
        "Xu et al. (2013) used the syntactic patterns to extract the collocation candidates in their two-stage framework.",
        "Based on the above, we can conclude that syntactic features are very important for T-P collocation extraction.",
        "However, the ?naturalness?",
        "problem can still seriously affect the performance of syntactic parser.",
        "Once our sentiment sentence compression method can improve the quality of parsing, the performance of T-P collocation extraction task can be improved as well.",
        "Note that, to date, there is no previous work using a sentence compression model to improve this task.",
        "5.2 Sentence Compression Sentence compression is a paraphrasing task aimed at generating sentences shorter than the given ones, while preserving the essential content (Jing, 2000).",
        "There are many applications that can benefit from a robust compression system, such as summarization systems (Li et al., 2013), semantic role labeling (Vickrey and Koller, 2008), relation extraction (Miwa et al., 2010) and so on.",
        "Commonly used to compress sentences, tree-based approaches (Knight and Marcu, 2002; Turner and Charniak, 2005; Galley and McKeown, 2007; Cohn and Lapata, 2009; Galanis and Androutsopoulos, 2010; Woodsend and Lapata, 2011; Thadani and McKeown, 2013) compress a sentence by editing the syntactic tree of the original sentence.",
        "However, the automatic parsing results may not be correct; thus, the compressed tree (after removing constituents from a bad parse) may not produce a good compressed sentence.",
        "McDonald (2006), Nomoto (2007), and Clarke and Lapata (2008) tried to solve the problem by using discriminative models.",
        "Aside from above extractive sentence compression approaches, there is another research line, namely, abstractive approach, which compresses an original sentence by reordering, substituting, and inserting, as well as removing (Cohn and Lapata, 2013).",
        "This method needs more resource and is more complicated.",
        "Therefore, in this paper, we only focus on extractive approach.",
        "At present, the current sentence compression methods all focus on formal sentences, and few methods are being proposed to study sentiment sentences.",
        "As discussed in the above sections, the current compression models cannot be directly utilized to T-P collocation extraction owing to the specificity of sentiment sentences.",
        "Therefore, a new compression model for sentiment sentences should be established.",
        "6 Conclusion and Future Work In this work, we presented a framework that adopted a CRF based sentiment sentence compression model Sent Comp, as a preprocessing step, to improve the T-P collocation extraction task.",
        "Different from the existing sentence compression models used for formal sentences, Sent Comp incorporated some sentiment-related features to retain the sentiment information.",
        "Experimental results showed that the system with the sentence compression step performed better than that without this step, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the framework and the compression model Sent Comp.",
        "1367 Generally, the idea of this framework maybe useful for many sentiment analysis tasks that rely heavily on syntactic results.",
        "Thus in the future, we will try to apply the Sent Comp model for these tasks.",
        "Besides, the simplicity and effectiveness of this framework motivates us to pursue the study further.",
        "For example, we will polish the Sent Comp model by exploring more sentiment-related features and exploring other types of compression models.",
