        "Nowadays, two popular approaches to data-driven syntactic parsing are based on constituency grammar on the one hand and dependency grammar on the other hand.",
        "There exist constituency-based treebanks for many languages and dependency treebanks for most of these languages are converted automatically from constituent trees with the help of conversion rules, which is the case for e.g. the languages used in the SPMRL-2013 Shared Task (Seddah et al., 2013) with the exception of Basque, where constituency trees are converted from manually annotated dependency trees (Aduriz et al., 2003), and Hungarian, where both treebanks are manually annotated (Csendes et al., 2005; Vincze et al., 2010).",
        "However, the quality of automatic dependency conversion is hardly investigated.",
        "Hungarian is one of those rare examples where there exist manual annotations for both constituency and dependency syntax on the same bunch of texts, the Szeged (Dependency) Treebank (Csendes et al., 2005; Vincze et al., 2010), which makes it possible to evaluate the quality of a rule-based automatic conversion from constituency to dependency trees, to compare the two sets of manual annotations and also the output of constituency and dependency parsers trained on converted and gold standard dependency trees.",
        "We investigate the effect of automatic conversions related to the two parsing paradigms as well.",
        "It is well known that for English, the automatic conversion of a constituency parser's output to dependency format can achieve competitive unlabeled attachment scores (ULA) to a dependency parser's output trained on automatically converted trees 1 (cf. Petrov et al. (2010)).",
        "One of the possible explanations for this is that English is a configurational language, hence constituency parsers have advantages over dependency parsers here.",
        "We check whether this hypothesis holds for Hungarian too, which is the prototype of free word order languages.",
        "In this paper, we compare three pairs of dependency analyses in order to evaluate the usefulness of converted trees.",
        "First, we examine the errors of the conversion itself by comparing the converted dependency trees with the manually annotated gold standard ones.",
        "Second, we argue for the importance of training parsers on gold standard trees by looking at the typical differences between the outputs of This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "1 However, it has been pointed out that errors in the conversion script may significantly influence the results of parsing, see e.g. Petrov and McDonald (2012) and Pitler (2012) 1392 dependency parsers trained on converted (silver standard) trees, parsers trained on gold standard trees and the manual annotation itself.",
        "Third, we demonstrate that similar to English, training on a constituency treebank and converting the results to dependency format can achieve similar results in terms of ULA to the dependency parser trained on the automatically converted treebank, but the typical errors they make differ in both cases.",
        "2 Parsing Hungarian on the Szeged Treebank Hungarian is a morphologically rich language, where word order encodes information structure, which makes its syntactic analysis very different from English's as the arguments in a sentence cannot be determined by their position but by their suffixes, cf. ?",
        "E. Kiss (2002).",
        "Words?",
        "grammatical functions are signified by case suffixes and verbs are marked for the number and person of their subject and the definiteness of their object, thus these arguments may be often omitted from the sentence: L?atlak (see- 1SG2OBJ) ?I see you?.",
        "Due to word order reasons, words that form one syntactic phrase may not be adjacent (long-distance dependencies), which is true for the possessive construction as well: the possessor and the possessed may be situated in two distant positions: A fi?unak elvette a kalapj?at (the boy-DAT take-PAST-3SGOBJ the hat-POSS3SG-ACC) ?He took the boy's hat?.",
        "Verbless clauses are also common in Hungarian, as the copula in third person singular present tense indicative form is phonologically empty, while it is present in all other moods and tenses: A kalap piros (the hat red) ?The hat is red?, but A kalap piros volt (the hat red was) ?The hat was red?.",
        "The Szeged Treebank (Csendes et al., 2005) is a manually annotated constituency treebank for Hungarian consisting of 82,000 sentences.",
        "Besides the phrase structure, grammatical roles of the verbs?",
        "arguments and morphological information are also annotated.",
        "It incorporates texts from six different domains: short business news, newspaper, law, literature, compositions and informatics, however, in this paper, we just focus on the short business news domain.",
        "The Szeged Dependency Treebank (Vincze et al., 2010) contains manual dependency syntax annotations for the same texts.",
        "Certain linguistic phenomena ?",
        "such as discontinuous structures ?",
        "are annotated in this treebank, but not in the constituency treebank.",
        "In the dependency treebank, the possessor is linked to the possession while this connection is not annotated in the constituency treebank.",
        "The two types of trees can be seen in Figure 1.",
        "CP PUNC .",
        "NP-ACC N kalapj?at T a V V0 V elvette NP-GEN N fi?unak T A A fi?unak elvette a kalapj?at .",

        "in constituency and dependency analysis.",
        "Another difference between the two treebanks is the way they represent different types of complex sentences, as can be seen in Figure 2.",
        "In the dependency treebank subordinations and coordinations are 1393 handled very similarly.",
        "The head of one of the clauses (the subordinated clause or the second clause in the case of coordination) is linked to the head of the other clause (the matrix clause of the subordination or the first clause of the coordination), only the type of relation between the two heads differs in the two structures, in the dependency tree in Figure 2, the heads of the three clauses (?atj?ott ?came over?, meg?",
        "?g?erte ?promised?",
        "and elj?on ?come?)",
        "are linked to one another through their conjunctions with either an ATT relation in the case of subordination or COORD for coordination.",
        "In the constituency treebank these sentences are represented very differently: in the case of subordination, the subordinated clause is within the matrix clause: CP 3 is within CP 2 in the constituency tree in Figure 2.",
        "Coordinated clauses appear at the same level in the structure, in the same figure CP 1 and CP 2 are coordinated clauses.",

        "The parallels of these two manually annotated treebanks make them suitable for testing our hypotheses about automatic dependency conversion.",
        "The differences between them originate from the characteristics of constituent and dependency syntax.",
        "3 Converting Constituency Trees to Dependency Trees In this section, we present our methods to convert constituency trees to dependency trees and we also discuss the most typical sources of errors during conversion.",
        "3.1 Conversion rules In order to convert constituency trees to dependency trees, we used a rule based system.",
        "Sentences with virtual dependency nodes were omitted, as they are not annotated in the constituent treebank and their treatment in dependency trees is also problematic (Farkas et al., 2012; Seeker et al., 2012).",
        "As a result, we worked with 7,372 sentences and 162,960 tokens.",
        "First, we determined the head of each clause (CP) and the relations between CPs in complex sentences.",
        "In most cases the head of the CP is a finite verb, if the CP contains no finite verb, the head is the either an infinitive verb or a participle, if none of these are present in the CP, the head can be a nominal expression.",
        "The relations between the CP heads make up the base of the dependency structure using ROOT relation for the sentence's main verb, COORD for coordination and ATT for subordination, as well as CONJ in the case of conjunctions between the CPs.",
        "1394 The arguments of verbs, infinitives and participles in the CP were linked to their governor and marked for their grammatical role in the Szeged Treebank.",
        "We used this information to construct the appropriate dependency relations between governors and their arguments.",
        "The main grammatical roles such as sub-ject, object, dative have their own label in dependency syntax, while minor ones are assigned the oblique (OBL) relation.",
        "The argument's modifiers were then linked to the head or other modifiers based on the phrase structure with relations according to their morphological code.",
        "Long distance dependencies, like the connection between a genitive case possessor and the possessed are not annotated in the constituency treebank.",
        "In these cases we used morphological information to link these elements together in the dependency tree.",
        "Figure 3 shows an example of converting a constituency tree to a dependency tree.",

        "3.2 Error Analysis We automatically converted the constituency treebank into dependency trees following the principles described above and detailed at our website (http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/rgai/ SzegedTreebank).",
        "For evaluation, we applied the metrics labeled attachment score (LAS) and unlabeled attachment score (ULA), without punctuation marks.",

        "The errors made during conversion were categorized manually in 200 sentences selected randomly from the short business news subcorpus of the Szeged Dependency Treebank, and the most typical ones are listed in Table 1, Column convError.",

        "One of the possible reasons for this may be that English is a configurational language, hence constituency parsers are expected to perform better here.",

        "We employed the product-of-grammars procedure (Petrov, 2010) of the Berkeleyparser (Petrov et al., 2006), where grammars are trained on the same dataset but with different initialization setups, which leads to different grammars.",
        "We trained 8 grammars and used tree-level inference.",
        "The output of the parser was then automatically converted to dependency format, based on the rules described in Section 3 (BerkeleyConv).",
        "Second, we used the silver standard dependency treebank for training the Bohnet parser (convDep).",
        "Since our constituency parser did not produce grammatical functions for the nodes, we trained the Bohnet parser on unlabeled dependency trees in order to ensure a fair comparison here (that is the difference between the columns BerkeleyConv and convDep in Table 1).",
        "As the numbers show, competitive results can be obtained with both methods, yielding an ULA score of 92.78 and 93.23, respectively.",

        "Manually analysing the errors on the same set of sentences as before, there are again some error categories that occur frequently in both cases such as coordination, the attachment of conjunctions, modifiers and determiners.",
        "On the other hand, training on constituency trees seems to have some specific sources of errors.",
        "First, the possessor in possessive constructions is less frequently attached to its possessed, which may be due to the fact that the genitive possessor is not linked to the possessed in the constituency treebank and thus the parser is not able to learn this relationship.",
        "Second, arguments of verbal elements (i.e. verbs, participles and infinitives) are also somewhat more difficult to find when there are at least two verbal elements within the clause, which is especially true for adverbial participles and infinitives.",

        "is linked to the adverbial participle in the correct analysis, but it connects to the main verb in the other.",
        "Third, identifying the root node of the sentence may also be problematic for this setting.",
        "As Farkas and Bohnet (2012) reported that preconversion can achieve better results for finding the root node in English, this seems to be a language-specific issue and it represents an interesting difference between English and Hungarian.",
        "Nevertheless, training on constituency trees has a beneficial effect on finding multiword named entities.",
        "Hence, it can be concluded that although the evaluation scores are similar, the errors the two systems make differ from each other.",
        "1399 6 Discussion and Conclusions Here, we compared dependency analyses of Hungarian obtained in different ways.",
        "It was revealed that although the accuracy scores are similar to each other, each system makes different types of errors.",
        "On the other hand, there are some specific linguistic phenomena that seem to be difficult for dependency parsing generally as they were among the most frequent sources of errors in each case (e.g. coordination, multiple modifiers and the attachment of conjunctions and adverbs).",
        "Converting constituency trees into dependency trees enabled us to experiment with a silver standard dependency corpus as well.",
        "Our results empirically showed that better results can be achieved on the gold standard corpus, hence manual annotation of dependency trees is desirable.",
        "However, when there is no access to manually annotated dependency data, converting the output of a constituency parser into dependency format or training the dependency parser on converted data may also be viable: similar to English, both solutions result in competitive scores but the errors the systems make differ from each other.",
        "In the future, we would like to investigate how the advantages of constituency and dependency representations may be further exploited in parsing Hungarian and we also plan to carry out some uptraining experiments with both types of parsers.",
