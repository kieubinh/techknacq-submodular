        "Databases of various semantic relations between natural language expressions are indispensable knowledge for many NLP applications.",
        "For instance, entailment relations are crucial in information extraction and QA (Dagan et al., 2009; Weisman et al., 2012; Berant et al., 2012; Turney and Mohammad, 2014).",
        "Temporal relations such as happens-before (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004b; Regneri et al., 2010) are important for enhancing deep semantic processing.",
        "A problem, however, is that it is difficult to acquire those relations with a broad coverage.",
        "Although many sophisticated machine learning techniques have been applied to various kinds of corpora for this task (Szpektor et al., 2007; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008; Hashimoto et al., 2009; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009; Hashimoto et al., 2012; Talukdar et al., 2012; Kloetzer et al., 2013), no satisfactory coverage has been achieved, probably due to data sparseness in the input data.",
        "In this work we take a completely different approach: we manually construct a semantic lexicon called Phased Predicate Template Taxonomy (PPTT), and derive various types of semantic relations on a large-scale by using it.",
        "Our target language is Japanese, but examples are given in English for simplicity throughout this paper.",
        "PPTT is a taxonomy of predicate templates (predicates with one argument slot like rescue X, ?Tem- plate?",
        "hereafter) that classifies templates according to phases of story concerning an entity denoted by X.",
        "In the story, or the ?life?",
        "of the entity X, X can be anticipated, created, then execute its function and finally it may collapse and become deficient.",
        "Anticipation, creation, execution, collapse, deficiency of X can be seen as such phases of story concerning X, and PPTT classifies templates into 41 semantic classes each of which corresponds to a phase.",
        "In other words, PPTT provides a way to describe the stories of various entities that constitute this world, and we believe that PPTT (partly) reflects how we understand the world and its entities.",
        "Accordingly, PPTT can also provide a way to derive various semantic knowledge about this world such as the happens-before relation between events involving an entity, e.g., since the creation phase usually occurs before the execution phase, invent X (creation phase) is likely to happen-before use X (execution phase).",
        "In addition, entailment relations can be derived: since the creation phase of an object X must have occurred if X is in its execution phase, it implies that use X is likely to entail invent X.",
        "In addition, there are ups and downs in stories; some entities suffer setbacks in their stories.",
        "PPTT describes such ?ups and downs?",
        "by means of a recently proposed semantic polarity, excitation (Hashimoto This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "1423 et al., 2012).",
        "Excitation classifies templates into excitatory, inhibitory, and neutral; an excitatory template like install X and buy X indicates that the main function, effect, purpose or role of the entity referred to by the X of the template is activated, enhanced, or prepared, 1 while an inhibitory template like uninstall X and X is canceled roughly indicates that it is deactivated or suppressed.",
        "Neutral templates are neither excitatory nor inhibitory (e.g., consider X).",
        "Roughly speaking, an excitatory template expresses the events that contribute to turn on the function of X, while an inhibitory template expresses the events that contribute to turn off or not to turn on the function of X.",
        "Then, in PPTT, excitatory and inhibitory respectively correspond to ?ups?",
        "and ?downs?",
        "in the story of X.",
        "The phases in PPTT are marked according to these ups and downs.",
        "Accordingly, PPTT can derive many antonymous contradiction pairs like install X?uninstall X, as Hashimoto et al. did, though we omit the detail for space limitation.",
        "Moreover, PPTT can derive a huge volume of anomalous obstruction, a contradiction-like novel semantic relation that we propose in this paper, like X is canceled;(cannot) buy X and X is sold out;(cannot) buy X, which indicate that if X is canceled or sold out, you cannot buy X. Anomalous obstruction should be used for Why-type QA (Oh et al., 2013), as well as a novel system that warns a user who wants to buy a commercial product that the product is started to be sold out or canceled in various e-commerce sites without any application-specific coding.",
        "As suggested, a story has a temporal order between its phases, which we call the canonical temporal order.",
        "In addition, some phases in a story would enable or necessitate another phase in the same story to occur.",
        "In PPTT, these relations are embodied in various temporal-semantic links between phases.",
        "Note that each link between two phases does not guarantee that every possible pair of templates taken from the two phases has such semantic relations; it just indicates that there exists such tendencies.",
        "Despite the absence of the guarantee, PPTT's links enable a million-scale derivation of semantic relations with the help of distributional similarity.",
        "In existing resources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), the links are assumed to be 100% correct, but it would be hard to have such absolutely correct links in a million-scale.",
        "Hence, we believe that our approximate links are more useful for a large-scale relation derivation.",
        "Note that the goal of our PPTT project is to derive a wide range of semantic relations on a large scale, rather than to complete a comprehensive template taxonomy.",
        "As such, PPTT lacks some templates as described in later sections.",
        "Nevertheless, we believe that our design brings much more good than harm, since we could generate various semantic relations on a million scale thanks to PPTT.",
        "Our experimental results show that we can derive 4.4 million happens-before relation instances with 79.5% precision, 0.5 million entailment relation instances with 70.0% precision, and one million anomalous obstruction relation instances with 73.5% precision.",
        "Constructing the PPTT taxonomy requires a manual labor cost, which amounted to three man-months in our case; however, we believe that this cost is lower than the cost for developing highly-precise automatic acquisition methods for all of happens-before, entailment, contradiction, and anomalous obstruction relations.",
        "We plan to release PPTT and the derived relation instances after the manual annotation of the derived instances to the NLP community.",
        "2 Related Works PPTT might resemble other semantic lexicons created in the long history of NLP (Levin, 1993; Kipper et al., 2006; Fellbaum, 1998; Bond et al., 2009; Fillmore, 1976; Baker et al., 1998; Halliday, 1985; Pustejovsky et al., 2003; Puscasu and Mititelu, 2008; Bejar et al., 1991; Jurgens et al., 2012).",
        "PPTT is different in that it primarily aims at deriving various types of semantic relations on a large scale exploiting the notion of the phase of story, rather than being a comprehensive taxonomy like those existing semantic lexicons.",
        "As a result, PPTT can derive more varieties of semantic relations between templates than any one of those existing lexicons.",
        "From WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998; Bond et al., 2009), we can derive entailment and contradiction relations using synsets and synset-links that represent relations such as ?troponym?, ?antonym?",
        "and ?entailment?.",
        "However, happens-before and anomalous obstruction relations 1 The above definition is slightly different from the original one in Hashimoto et al. (2012).",
        "We inserted the verb ?prepared?",
        "into the original definition.",
        "This clarifies that various preparation processes for X, such as buy X, can be regarded as excitatory templates.",
        "We also assume that such templates as X exists and have X, which mean little more than just existence, are regarded as excitatory templates in PPTT based on the assumption that existence can be regarded as preparation for the function of X.",
        "1424 cannot be derived from it, since there is no information on temporal ordering except that on causality.",
        "From VerbNet (Levin, 1993; Kipper et al., 2006), the hyponymy/synonymy type of entailment relations may be derived using templates in the same verb classes constructed based on shared syntactic behavior, possibly with the help of statistical methods.",
        "However, the other types of relations that can be derived from PPTT cannot be derived from VerbNet, since there is no link representing relationships between the verb classes.",
        "FrameNet (Fillmore, 1976; Baker et al., 1998) was used to derive hyponymy/synonymy types of entailment (Coyne and Rambow, 2009; Aharon et al., 2010) using information such as a Frame-to-frame relation ?Inheritance?",
        "(is-a relation).",
        "In addition, happens-before relations can be derived using ?Precedes?",
        "(Later-Earlier relations).",
        "However, since it does not contain semantic constraints like enablement and necessity that PPTT contains, it is not trivial to derive presupposition type of entailment or anomalous obstruction instances from it.",
        "TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003; Puscasu and Mititelu, 2008) contains various temporal information and can be used to derive context-dependent happens-before relations such as the relation between ?leaves?",
        "and ?will not hear?",
        "in the sentence ?If Graham leaves to-day, he will not hear Sabine?",
        "through TLINK (Pustejovsky et al., 2003) annotated manually; thus, it is difficult to derive context-independent relations from it, while they can be derived from PPTT.",
        "Besides, since it covers only temporal information, it is difficult to derive other types of relations from it.",
        "From Bejar et al.'s semantic relation taxonomy of lexical pairs (Bejar et al., 1991; Jurgens et al., 2012), using semantic relation categories such as ?act: act attribute?",
        "(e.g., creep:slow), lexical entailment relations were extracted (Turney and Mohammad, 2014).",
        "However, it is not trivial to derive happens-before or anomalous obstruction relations from it since it does not contain information on temporal sequences between verbs.",
        "Furthermore, our work differs from automatic methods for extracting temporal or causal relations (Szpektor et al., 2007; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009; Talukdar et al., 2012; Hashimoto et al., 2012; Hashimoto et al., 2014) in that our method does not require that target pairs co-occur in a document, unlike the previous methods.",
        "Hence, our method is likely to be immune to data sparseness.",
        "We could actually derive a wide range of relation instances that were rarely written in documents because they were too commonsensical (e.g., X is constructed happens-before sew (some- thing) at X).",
        "Needless to say, such commonsensical knowledge is often needed to develop intelligent systems.",
        "3 PPTT Design In PPTT, templates are organized hierarchically into three levels.",
        "In each level, there are classes that correspond to phases of stories, which we call Level-0 (L0), Level-1 (L1), and Level-2 (L2) classes.",
        "Each template belongs to only one class at each level.",
        "In the following, we describe each level.",
        "3.1 L0-Classes and L0-Links First we divided the entire story concerning an entity X into five phases: non-existence, existence, func-tioning, non-existence to existence transition and existence to non-existence transition.",
        "Then we created the five L0-classes listed below, each of which corresponds to one of these five phases.",
        "Non-existence Class The class of templates that do not entail the existence of X, e.g., plan X.",
        "2 Existence Class The class of templates that entail X's existence but does not imply the execution of its main function or the achievement of its objectives, e.g., buy X, X exists.",
        "Functioning Class The class of templates that imply the execution of X's main function or the achievement of its objectives, e.g., use X, eat X. Non-existence to Existence Transition Class (NET Class) The class of templates that express the transition from a situation in which X does not exist to a situation in which it exists, e.g., manufacture X.",
        "2 One might think the definition of the Non-existence Class should be ?the templates that DO entail X's NON-EXISTENCE?.",
        "We did not use such a definition because it would overlook many templates that are consistent with X's NON-EXISTENCE but DO NOT entail X's NON-EXISTENCE, like order X.",
        "1425 Existence to Non-existence Transition Class (ENT Class) The class of templates that express the transition from a situation in which X exists to a situation in which it does not exist, e.g., dismantle X.",

        "\"#\"$%1(),3(42,5!%*% Figure 1: L0-links among L0-classes.",
        "As mentioned in the introduction, we assume a canonical temporal order among L0-classes.",
        "For instance, templates in the NET class (e.g., manufacture X) should refer to events that usually happen before those events referred to by templates in the Existence class (e.g., buy X), Functioning class (e.g., use X) and ENT class (e.g., dismantle X).",
        "We enumerated such temporal restrictions, each of which is represented by a link in Figure 1, which we call L0-links and used them for deriving relations.",
        "Note that we did not set any L0-link between the Existence class and the Functioning class because the events described by them may happen in various orders or have temporal overlap.",
        "For example, X exists should have temporal overlap with use X.",
        "Of course, such metaphysical notions as the canonical temporal order and the phases must have many complications and exceptions.",
        "First, many templates that have the neutral excitation polarity (Hashimoto et al., 2012) did not seem to follow the canonical temporal order among L0-classes.",
        "For instance, since the neutral template think about X does not entail the existence of X, it belongs to the Non-existence class but one can consider X while X exists or while it is functioning or even after it is collapsed and violate canonical temporal ordering.",
        "For this reason, we excluded neutral templates from PPTT and will deal with them in a different framework as a future work.",
        "In addition, although we did not assume a temporal order between the Existence class and the Functioning class, some templates in these classes have a happens-before relation as special cases (e.g., buy X in the Existence class happens before eat X in the Functioning class).",
        "The proposed L0-links also cause problems.",
        "For instance, order X (Non- Existence class) may not always happen before create X (NET class) even though the L0-links indicate a happens-before relation between their classes.",
        "We dealt as far as possible with such cases in level 2 with L2-classes, which are finer than L0-classes.",
        "Nonetheless, we stress that the overall plausibility of the canonical temporal order among L0-classes was experimentally confirmed through the derivation of happens-before relations only using L0-links.",
        "Note that the design of the L0-classes was inspired by the Generative Lexicon (Pustejovsky, 1998) and Aristotle's Entelecheia (Aristotle, 1987).",
        "3.2 L1-Classes Excitation L0-class Excitatory Inhibitory POTENTIAL class FORECLOSING class Non-existence class e.g., plan X e.g., prevent X ENABLING class INCOMMODE class Existence class e.g., buy X e.g., weaken X ACTUALIZING class DISORDERING class Functioning class e.g., X functions e.g., X loses GENERATING class NET class e.g., X is born N/A CORRUPTING class ENT class N/A e.g., destroy X Table 1: L1-classes.",
        "Next, we divided some L0-classes into L1-classes using the excitation polarity (Hashimoto et al., 2012) to introduce ?ups and downs?",
        "to PPTT, which enables to capture semantic inconsistencies between templates (e.g., install X?uninstall X) and negative interaction between the events referred to by the templates in PPTT (e.g., X is canceled;(cannot) hold X).",
        "Excitation was originally proposed for recognizing contradictions and causal relations between templates and then was successfully applied to other deep semantic processing (Oh et al., 2013; Varga et al., 2013; Kloetzer et al., 2013; Hashimoto et al., 2014).",
        "1426 As shown in Table 1, we divided each of three L0-classes (Non-existence class, Existence class and Functioning class) into two L1-classes, each of which corresponds to excitatory and inhibitory.",
        "Since the transition to an existence situation can be interpreted as an enhancement of an entity's function, we assumed that all the templates in the NET classes are excitatory because they express a transition of entity X from a non-existence situation to an existence situation.",
        "Similarly, we assume all the templates from the ENT class are inhibitory.",
        "Also, L1-classes do not have specific links between them beside the L0-links from their parent classes.",
        "3.3 L2-Classes and L2-Links Finally, we divided L1-classes into 41 L2-classes.",
        "Specifically, we first roughly grouped together semantically similar templates from the same L1-class and identified the common semantic properties among them.",
        "Note that in the rough grouping, we classified templates so that the resulting groups fit into fine-grained phases in the story concerning X.",
        "After this initial grouping, we classified all the templates into the L2-classes that are listed in Table 3 alongside the classification criteria and the number of templates in each class.",
        "As the classification criteria, we used the identified common semantic properties among members of each class.",
        "Note that some L2-classes can be regarded as a subset of another L2-class.",
        "For instance, the PROHIBIT L2-class can be seen as a subset of the PREVENTION L2-class.",
        "When a template meets the classification criteria of both a subset class and its superset class, we classified it into the subset class.",
        "We also made links called L2-links between the L2-classes.",
        "The motivation behind this is to capture finer temporal-semantic constraints that could not be specified at Level-0 and Level-1 as well as to capture the temporal-semantic constraints inside a single L0 or L1-class.",
        "For example, the temporal order between buy X and eat X is encoded in a L2-link between the ACQUISITION and EXECUTION L2-classes, while there is no L0-link between the Existence L0-class (class of buy X) and the Functioning L0-class (class of eat X).",
        "This exemplifies that the L2- and L0-links complement each other.",
        "Each L2-link has one of the six types of temporal-semantic links that are summarized in Table 2 with the number of links of each type.",
        "The link types were designed to capture how the events referred to by the templates in a class affect the occurrence or non-occurrence of the events referred to by the templates in a class in the past, present, or future.",
        "C 1 and C 2 being two L2-classes, C 1 's effect on the occurrence or non-occurrence of C 2 is represented by Positive ( + ) and Negative ( ? )",
        "links, respectively, while C 1 's effect on the past, present, or future phase of X expressed by C 2 is represented by Past, Present, and Future links, respectively.",
        "For instance, the Past + link from the ABANDONMENT class to the ACQUISITION class indicates that a template from the ACQUISITION class (e.g., obtain X) must occur before a template from the ABANDONMENT class (e.g., get rid of X), and the Future ?",
        "link from the PROHIBIT class to the EXECUTION class indicates that templates from the PROHIBIT class (e.g., ban X) disable templates from the EXECUTION class (e.g., utilize X).",
        "Notice that L2-links represent such semantic constraints as enablement and necessity in addition to temporal order, and they are useful for deriving various kinds of semantic relations including entailment and anomalous obstruction, as shown in a later section.",
        "The first author of this paper hand-labeled the links between every combination of L2-class pairs by considering the name of the classes and a few example templates in each.",
