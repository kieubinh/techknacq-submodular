        "Reading inevitably leads people to discover interesting concepts, entities, and topics.",
        "Predicting what interests a user while reading a document has important applications ranging from augmenting the document with supplementary information, to ad placement, to content recommendation.",
        "We define the task of predicting interesting things (ITs) as ranking text spans in an unstructured document according to whether a user would want to know more about them.",
        "This desire to learn more serves as our proxy for interestingness.",
        "There are many types of observable behavior that indicate user interest in a text span.",
        "The closest one to our problem definition is found in web browsing, where users click from one document to another via named anchors.",
        "The click process is generally governed by the user's interest (modulo erroneous clicks).",
        "As such, the anchor name can be viewed as a text span of interest for that user.",
        "Furthermore, the frequency with which users, in aggregate, click on an anchor serves as a good proxy for the level of interest1.",
        "What is perceived as interesting is influenced by many factors.",
        "The semantics of the document and candidate IT are important.",
        "For example, we find that when users read an article about a movie, they are more likely to browse to an article about an actor or character than to another movie or the director.",
        "Also, user profile and geo-temporal information are relevant.",
        "For example, interests can differ depending on the cultural and socio-economic background of a user as well as the time of the session (e.g., weekday versus weekend, daytime versus late night, etc.).",
        "1 Other naturally occurring expressions of user interest, albeit less fitting to our problem, are found in web search queries, social media engagement, and others.",
        "1477 Strictly speaking, human interestingness is a psychological and cognitive process (Varela et al., 1991).",
        "Clicks and long dwell times are salient observed behavioral signals of interestingness that have been well accepted in the information retrieval literature (Claypool et al., 2001; Mueller and Lockerd, 2001).",
        "In this paper, we utilize the observed user's browsing behavior as a supervision signal for modeling interestingness.",
        "Specifically, we cast the prediction of ITs as a discriminative learning task.",
        "We use a regression model to predict the likelihood of an anchor in a Wikipedia article to be clicked, which as we have seen above can serve as a proxy for interestingness.",
        "Based on an empirical study of a sample of our data, we use features in our model from the document context (such as the position of the anchor text, frequency of the anchor text in the current paragraph, etc.)",
        "as well as semantic features that aim to capture the latent topic space of the documents in the browsing transition.",
        "These semantic features are obtained in an unsupervised manner via a joint topic model of source and target documents in browsing transitions.",
        "We show empirical evidence that our discriminative model is effective in predicting ITs and we demonstrate that the automatically learned latent semantic features contribute significantly to the model performance.",
        "The main contributions of this paper are: ?",
        "We introduce the task of predicting interesting things as identifying what a user likely wants to learn more about while reading a document.",
        "?",
        "We use browsing transitions as a proxy for interestingness and model our task using a discriminative training approach.",
        "?",
        "We propose a semantic probabilistic model of interestingness, which captures the latent aspects that drive a user to be interested in browsing from one document to another.",
        "Features derived from this semantic model are used in our discriminative learner.",
        "?",
        "We show empirical evidence of the effectiveness of our model on an application scenario.",
        "2 Related Work Salience: A notion that might at first glance be confused with interestingness is that of salience (Paranjpe 2009; Gamon et al. 2013).",
        "Salience can be described as the centrality of a term to the content of a document.",
        "Put another way, it represents what the document is about.",
        "Though salience and interestingness can interact, There are clear differences.",
        "For example, in a news article about President Obama's visit to Seattle, Obama is salient, yet the average user would probably not be interested in learning more about Obama while reading that article.",
        "Click Prediction: Click prediction models are used pervasively by search engines.",
        "Query based click prediction aims at computing the probability that a given document in a search-result page is clicked on after a user enters some query (Joachims, 2002; Joachims et al., 2005; Agichtein et al., 2006; Guo et al., 2009a).",
        "Click prediction for online advertising is a core signal for estimating the relevance of an ad to a search result page or a document (Chatterjee et al., 2003; Broder et al., 2007; Craswell et al., 2008; Graepel et al., 2010).",
        "Also related are personalized click models, e.g., (Shen et al., 2012), which use user-specific click through rate (CTR).",
        "Although these applications and our task share the use of CTR as a supervision signal, there is a key difference: Whereas in web search CTR is used as a predictor/fea-ture at runtime, our task specifically aims at predicting interestingness in the absence of web usage features: Our input is completely unstructured and there is no assumption of prior user interaction data.",
        "Use of probabilistic models: Our semantic model is built over LDA (Blei et al., 2003) and has resemblances to Link-LDA models (Erosheva et al., 2004) and Comment-LDA models (Yano et al., 2009).",
        "However, these are tailored for blogs and associated comment discussions which is very different from our source to destination browsing transition logs.",
        "Guo et al., (2009b) used probabilistic models for discovering entity classes from query logs and in (Lin et al., 2012), latent intents in entity centric search were explored.",
        "Gao et al. (2011) employ statistical machine translation to connect two types of content, learning semantic translation of queries to document titles.",
        "None of the above models, however, are directly applicable to the joint topic mappings that are involved in source to destination browsing transitions which are the focus of our work.",
        "Predicting Popular Content: Modeling interestingness is also related to predicting popular content in the Web and content recommenders (Lerman and Hogg, 2010; Szabo and Huberman, 2010; Bandari et al., 2012).",
        "In contrast to these tasks, we strive to predict what term a user is likely to be interested in when reading content.",
        "We do not rely on prior browsing history, since we aim to predict interestingness 1478 in unstructured text with no interaction history.",
        "We show in our experiments that a popularity signal alone is not a sufficient predictor for interestingness.",
        "3 The Interestingness Task The process of identifying interesting things (ITs) on a page consists of two parts: (1) generating candidate things (e.g., entities, concepts, topics); and (2) scoring and ranking these according to interestingness.",
        "In this paper, we fix step 1 and focus our effort on step 2, i.e., the assignment of an interestingness score to a candidate.",
        "We believe that this scope is appropriate in order to understand the factors that enter into what is perceived as interesting by a user.",
        "Once we have gained an understanding of the interestingness scoring problem, however, there are opportunities in identifying candidates automati-cally, which we leave for future work.",
        "In this section we begin by formally defining our task.",
        "We then introduce our data set of naturally occurring interest signals, followed by an investigation of the factors that influence them.",
        "3.1 Formal Task Definition We define our task as follows.",
        "Let ??",
        "be the set of all documents and ??",
        "be the set of all candidate text spans in all documents in ??",
        ", generated by some candidate generator.",

        "(1) 3.2 Data Set User browsing events on the web (i.e., a user clicking from one document to another) form a naturally occurring collection of interestingness signals.",
        "That is when a user clicks on an anchor in a document, we can postulate that the user is interested in learning more about it, modulo erroneous clicks.",
        "We collect a large set of many millions of such user browsing events from session logs of a commercial web browser.",
        "Specifically, we collect from these logs each occurrence of a user click from one Wikipedia page to another during a one month period, from all users in all parts of the world.",
        "We refer to each such event as a transition.",
        "For each transition, our browser log provides metadata, including user profile information, geo-location information and session information (e.g., time of click, source/target dwell time, etc.)",
        "Our data set includes millions of transitions between Wikipedia pages.",
        "For our task we require: (1) a mechanism for generating candidate things; (2) ample clicks to serve as a reliable signal of interestingness for training our models; and (3) accessible content.",
        "Our focus on Wikipedia satisfies all.",
        "First, Wikipedia pages tend to contain many anchors, which can serve as the set of candidate things to be ranked.",
        "Second, Wikipedia attracts enough traffic to obtain robust browsing transition data.",
        "Finally, Wikipedia provides full content3 dumps.",
        "It is important here to note that our choice of Wikipedia as a test bed for our experiments does not restrict the general applicability of our approach: We propose a semantic model (Section 4.2) for mining latent features relevant to the phenomenon of interestingness which is general and can be applied to generic Web document collections.",
        "Using uniform sampling, we split our data into three sets: a development set (20%), a training set (60%) and a test set (20%).",
        "We further subdivide the test set by assigning each transition as belonging to the HEAD, TORSO, or TAIL, which we compute using inverse CDF sampling on the test set.",
        "We do so by assigning the most frequently occurring transitions, accounting for 20% of the (source) traffic, to the HEAD.",
        "Similarly, the least frequently occurring transitions, accounting for 20% of the (source) traf-fic, are assigned to the TAIL.",
        "The remaining transitions are assigned to the TORSO.",
        "This three-way split reflects a common practice in the IR community and is based on the observation that web traffic frequencies show a very skewed distribution, with a small set of web pages attracting a large amount of traffic, and a very long tail of infrequently visited sites.",
        "Different regions in that distribution often show marked differences in behaviour, and models that are useful in one region are not necessarily as useful in another.",

        "For source articles of the TVSeries category, Actor destination articles account for 86% of clicks.",
        "Actor articles lead to clicks on Movie articles (45%) and other Actor articles (26%), whereas Artist articles lead to clicks on other Artist articles (29%), Movie articles (17%) and MusicRecording articles (18%).",
        "The structure of the source page plays a role: It is well known that the position of a link on a page influences user click behavior: links that are higher on a page or in a more prominent position tend to attract more clicks.",
        "We noticed similar trends in our data.",
        "The user plays a role: We hypothesized that users from different geographic and cultural backgrounds might exhibit different interests, or that interests are time-bound (e.g., interests on weekends differ from those on week days, daytime from nighttime, etc.)",

        "Each transition in our training data is represented as a vector of features, where the features fall into three basic families: 1 Anchor features (Anc): position of the anchor in the document, frequency of the anchor, anchor density in the paragraph, and whether the anchor text matches the title of the destination page.",
