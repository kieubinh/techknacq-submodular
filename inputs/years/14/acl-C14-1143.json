        "The value of human annotated syntactic structures for Statistical Machine Translation has been clearly demonstrated in string-to-tree (Galley et al., 2004; Galley et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006), tree-to-string (Liu et al., 2006; Liu and Gildea, 2008), and tree-to-tree (Eisner, 2003; Liu et al., 2009; Chiang, 2010) models.",
        "One recurring issue which hampers the utility of syntactic structures is the incompatibility between word alignments and syntactic structures (Denero and Klein, 2007; Fossum et al., 2008; Pauls et al., 2010).",
        "The incompatibility arises because word alignments and syntactic structures are established independently of each other.",
        "In the case of tree-to-tree models, there is also the issue of incompatible parallel tree structures resulting from divergent syntactic annotation standards that have been independently conceived based on monolingual corpora (Chiang, 2010).",
        "In this paper, we report an effort in building a Hierarchically Aligned Chinese-English Parallel Treebank (HACEPT) where we manually do word-level and phrase-level alignments simultaneously on parallel phrase-based parse trees.",
        "In this process, we attempt to establish an annotation standard that harmonizes word-level and phrase-level alignments.",
        "We also analyze a common incompatibility issue between Chinese-English parallel parse trees exposed in the annotation process, with the goal of solving the issue by semi-automatically revising the trees.",
        "In the rest of this paper, we describe how we construct the HACEPT and discuss issues arising in the construction process.",
        "In Section 2, we discuss the problems of word alignment done without considering its interaction with syntactic structures.",
        "In Section 3, we describe our annotation procedure where we perform word-level and phrase-level alignments simultaneously in a coordinated manner, and show how our approach is free of the problems discussed in Section 2.",
        "In Section 4, we report a common incompatibility issue between parse trees and propose a solution.",
        "We also compare the issue with translation divergence (Dorr, 1994) and show that they are different in nature and occurrence frequency.",
        "In Section 5, we present the results of two experiments we have done on our annotation to show the intuitiveness of our approach and the linguistic and engineering potentials of our corpus.",
        "We then describe related work in Section 6 and conclude our paper in Section 7.",
        "1511 2 Incompatibilities between word alignments and syntactic structures All the existing word alignment practice we know of treats word alignment as a stand-alone task without systematically considering its interaction with the syntactic structure of a sentence.",
        "The inevitable consequence of the practice is that both redundancies and incompatibilities between word alignments and syntactic structures will arise in many places.",
        "In this section, we illustrate the issues through language-particular function words, where the problems are most frequently found.",
        "Due to language-particular idiosyncrasy and lack of lexical content, these function words usually do not have a translation coun-terpart, which presents a great challenge to alignment annotation.",
        "There are two logical possibilities of dealing with these words, both of which are represented in existing annotation practice.",
        "The first is to leave them unaligned or link them to a fictitious NULL word (Ahrenberg, 2007; Brown et al., 1990), and the second, which also seems to be the more common pratice, is to attach these function words to a word that has a translation counterpart, and then align the function word and its host with the counterpart of the host (Melamed, 1998; Li et al., 2009).",
        "For ease of discussion, below we will refer to the latter pratice as the \"glue-to-a-host\" strategy (GTAHS).",
        "Both approaches are less than desirable: the former leaves the function words unaccounted for, and the latter leads to incompatibility issues we discuss in detail below.",
        "First note that, by attaching language-particular function words to a host, the GTAHS creates redundancies between word alignments and syntactic structures since many of these function words have already been associated with a host within a constituent in the parse tree (e.g., the English determiner the is placed inside the projection of its host, namely an NP).",
        "A more serious issue is that the GTAHS creates spurious ambiguities.",
        "Lexical ambiguity is inevitable in translation.",
        "For instance, the English noun bank has more than one lexical meaning and each of the meanings corresponds to a different Chinese word.",
        "That fact aside, the GTAHS creates spurious ambiguities, which, in our view, would be harmful to Machine Translation (MT) if extracted as translation rules.",
        "Consider the following example, where the Chinese noun??",
        "is aligned to six English strings (aligned elements are underlined): (1) a. eat apples <>???",
        "b. eat an apple <>???",
        "c. eat the apple <>???",
        "d. fond of apples <>????",
        "e. talk about apples <>????",
        "f. provide them with apples <>?????",
        "The English apple and the Chinese??",
        "match in meaning and are both unambiguous.",
        "In cases where the English noun is used with a determiner as in (1b) and (1c), since Chinese has no determiners and the bare noun??",
        "can be the appropriate translation for either an apple or the apple given a context, the GTAHS attaches the determiner to apple and the whole string is aligned with??.",
        "In other similar cases where an English element such as a preposition is absent in Chinese as in (1d), (1e) and (1f), the GTAHS glues the preposition to apple and the whole PP is aligned with ??.",
        "With the GTAHS, the unambiguous Chinese ??",
        "ends up being aligned with more than one English string.",
        "This kind of spurious ambiguity is very common given the GTAHS.",
        "The second issue is that, by attaching function words to a host, the GTAHS effectively creates rudimentary syntactic structures, which are often incompatible with the syntactic structures annotated based on existing treebanking annotation standards.",
        "For example, all the aligned multi-word strings underlined in (2) do not correspond to a constituent in a Penn TreeBank (Marcus et al., 1993) or Chinese TreeBank (Xue et al., 2005) parse tree: (2) a.",
        "If I were him <>???????",
        "b. He is visiting Beijing <>??????",
        "1512 c. the beginning of the new year <>????",
        "d. to quickly and efficiently solve the problem <>?????????",
        "Given the incompatibilities between existing word alignments and syntactic structures, in the next section we describe an approach where we perform word-level and phrase-level alignments simultaneously on parallel phrase-based parse trees, attempting to construct a hierarchically aligned corpus where word alignments are harmonized with syntactic structures.",
        "3 Annotation specification and procedure The data we annotate is the Chinese-English portion of the Parallel Aligned Treebank (PAT) described in (Li et al., 2012).",
        "Our data consists of two batches, one of which is weblogs and the other of which is postings from online discussion forums.",
        "The English sentences in the data set are annotated based on the original Penn TreeBank (PTB) annotation stylebook (Bies et al., 1995) as well as its extensions (Warner et al., 2004), while the Chinese sentences in the data set are annotated based on the Chinese TreeBank (CTB) annotation guidelines (Xue and Xia, 2000) and its extensions (Zhang and Xue, 2012).",
        "The PAT only has word alignments, which are done under the GTAHS, and no phrase alignments.",
        "The main departure of our approach is that we loosen the requirement that every word in a sentence pair needs to be word-aligned.",
        "On the word level, we only align words that have an equivalent in terms of lexical meaning and grammatical function.",
        "For words that do not have a translation counterpart, we leave them unaligned and locate the appropriate phrases in which they appear to be aligned.",
        "This way, we eliminate both the redundancies and spurious ambiguities discussed in Section 2.",
        "Since phrase alignment is done between syntactic nodes on parallel parse trees, we also eliminate the incompatibilities between word alignments and syntactic structures.",
        "See the discussion of the concrete example in Figure 1 below to see the points made here.",
        "Next we discuss our annotation procedure in detail.",
        "Our annotators are presented with sentence pairs that come with parallel parse trees.",
        "The task of the annotator is to decide, first on the word level and then on the phrase level, if a word or phrase needs to be aligned at all, and if so, to which word or phrase it should be aligned.",
        "The decisions about word alignment and phrase alignment are not independent, and must obey well-formedness constraints as outlined in (Tinsley et al., 2007): a.",
        "A non-terminal node can only be aligned once.",
        "b. if Node n c is aligned to Node n e , then the descendants of n c can only be aligned to descendants of n e .",
        "c. if Node n c is aligned to Node n e , then the ancestors of n c can only be aligned to ancestors of n e .",
        "This means that once a word alignment is in place, it puts constraints on phrase alignments.",
        "A pair of non-terminal nodes (n c , n e ) cannot be aligned if a word that is a descendant of n c is aligned to a word that is not a descendant of n e on the word level.",
        "Let us use the concrete example in Figure 1 to illustrate the annotation process, which is guided by a set of detailed annotation guidelines.",
        "On the word level, only those words that are connected with a dashed line are aligned since they have equivalents.",
        "Note that the Chinese words?",
        "(a function word used to prepose the object to the left of the verb),??",
        "(an adverb meaning \"this way\"),?",
        "(a modal meaning \"can\") and the English discourse connective so that, the auxiliary verb is and the preposition from are all left unaligned on the word level.",
        "Aligning these function words will generate artificial ambiguous cases and create incompatibilities between word alignments and parse trees that have already been illustrated and discussed in Section 2.",
        "For instance, if?",
        "is to be word-aligned, it would be glued to the noun?",
        "?",
        "and the whole string???",
        "will be aligned to the English gravity.",
        "Note that both??",
        "and gravity are unambiguous and form a one-to-one correspondence.",
        "With the word alignment between ?",
        "??",
        "and gravity, we make the unambiguous gravity correspond to both ??",

        "With word alignments in place, next the annotator needs to perform phrase alignments.",
        "Note that word alignments place restrictions on phrase alignments.",
        "For instance, e 9 and e 10 will be ruled out as possible alignments for c 10 , because?",
        "?, a descendant of c 10 , is aligned to sludge, which is not a descendant of either e 9 or e 10 .",
        "By contrast, e 3 is a possible alignment for c 10 because the alignment does not violate the well-formedness constraints.",
        "The annotator then needs to decide whether this possible phrase alignment can be actually made.",
        "This is a challenging task since, for a given phrase, there usually are more than one candidate from which a single alignment needs to be picked.",
        "For instance, for e 3 , there are in total three possible phrase alignments, namely c 10 , c 3 and c 9 , all of which obey the well-formedness constraints.",
        "Since a non-terminal node is not allowed to be aligned to multiple non-terminal nodes on the other side, the annotator needs to choose one among all the candidates.",
        "This highlights the point that the alignment of non-terminal nodes cannot be deterministically inferred from the alignment of terminal nodes.",
        "This is especially true given our approach where some terminal nodes are left unaligned on the word level.",
        "For instance, the reason why c 9 is a possible alignment for e 3 is because the word??",
        "is left unaligned.",
        "If ??",
        "were aligned with so that, c 9 could not be aligned with e 3 since so that is not a descendant of e 3 and aligning the two nodes will violate Constraint b. While Constraints b and c can be enforced automatically given the word alignments, the decisions regarding the alignment of non-terminal nodes which satisfy Constraint a are based on linguistic considerations.",
        "One key consideration is to determine which non-terminal nodes encapsulate the grammatical relations signaled by the unaligned words so that the alignment of the non-terminal nodes will effectively capture the unaligned words in their syntactic context.",
        "When identifying non-terminal nodes to align, we follow two seemingly conflicting general principles: ?",
        "Phrase alignment should not sever key dependencies involving the grammatical relation signaled by an unaligned word.",
        "?",
        "Phrase alignment should be minimal, in the sense that the phrase alignment should contain only the elements involved in the grammatical relation, and nothing more.",
        "The first principle ensures that the grammatical relation is properly encapsulated in the aligned non-terminal nodes.",
        "For example in Figure 1, if we attach the English preposition from to running and aligning them to?",
        "?, we would fail to capture the fact that from signals a relation between prohibit and running downhill.",
        "Aligning VP c3 with S e3 captures this relation.",
        "The first principle in and of itself is insufficient to produce desired alignment.",
        "Taken to the extreme, it can be trivially satisfied by aligning the two root nodes of the sentence pair.",
        "We also need the alignment to be minimal, in the sense that aligned non-terminal nodes should contain only the elements involved in the grammatical relation, and nothing more.",
        "These two requirements used in conjunction ensure that a unique phrase alignment can be found for each unaligned word.",
        "The phrase alignments (VP c1 , VP e1 ), (VP c2 , VP e2 ), (VP c3 , S e3 ), as illustrated in Figure 1, all satisfy these two principles.",
        "In addition to making phrase alignments, the annotator needs to assign labels to phrase alignments.",

        "As shown above, UA is basically an artificial issue that is caused by difference in parsing guideline design and fixable through automatic binarization.",
        "Structural divergence arises mainly due to genuine cross-linguistic differences.",
        "We provide an example of structural divergence (STD) in Figure 2d.",
        "As shown in the figure, the two aligned phrases (VP and S) are structurally quite different: the English string is a clause with the NP the sweat as the subject and the VP flowing over me as the predicate (the example is taken out of the sentence I felt the sweat flowing over me to save space).",
        "The Chinese string is a simple verb phrase where the adverb??",
        "(literally whole-body) modifies the verb??",
        "(literally emerge-sweat).",
        "In terms of meaning correspondence,??",
        "expresses the meaning of the English PP over me and the verb matches in meaning with the sweat flowing.",
        "We have run an experiment on STD and found that the STD cases are pretty rare (on average 5 instances in a file with 500 sentence pairs), indicating that the structural difference between Chinese and English is not so fundamental as to make a big impact on alignment annotation.",
        "1517 5 Annotation experiments We did two experiments on our annotation.",
        "The first is about inter-annotator agreement (IAA), which is a way of both evaluating the annotation quality and judging the intuitiveness of the annotation task.",
        "An unintuitive annotation task would force the annotator to make subjective choices, which would result in low IAA.",
        "Since the annotation task involves parse trees, ideally we need annotators who are trained in syntax, but that would put a constraint on the pool of qualified annotators and make it difficult for the annotation to scale up.",
        "In our annotation experiments, we use four annotators who are fluent in both English and Chinese but have no prior linguistic training, led by a syntactician who performs the final adjudication.",
        "As of this writing, we have completed the single annotation of 8,932 sentence pairs, 2,500 of which are double annotated.",
        "The IAA statistics presented in Table 1 are based on the double-annotated 2,500 sentence pairs, which are divided into 5 chunks of 500 sentence pairs each.",
        "The statistics are for phrase alignment only, and the micro-average for the 5 chunks is 0.87 (F1), indicating we are able to get good quality annotation for this task.",
        "In addition, the agreement statistics for the 5 chunks are very stable, even though they are performed by different pairs of annotators, indicating we are getting consistent annotation from different annotators.",
        "Table 2 shows the result of the second experiment, namely the distribution of the different types of phrase alignment.",
        "It shows that alignments that contain unaligned function words outnumber those that do not, and that alignments that do not involve reordering outnumber those that do.",
        "It also shows that an overwhelming number of alignments that involve reordering also have unaligned function words.",
        "This means that the function words are potentially useful \"triggers\" for reordering, which is an important issue that MT systems are trying to address.",
        "Chunk No.",

        "However, most of the existing parallel treebanks (Li et al., 2012; Megyesi et al., 2010) do not have phrase alignments.",
        "Some (Sulger et al., 2013; Kapanadze, 2012) do have phrase alignments, but neither discussion about the interaction between word-level and phrase-level alignments nor report of IAA is provided.",
        "There have been a few recent attempts at automatically aligning subtrees (comparable to our phrases) in the context ofMT research, and the automatic alignments are evaluated against a small manually aligned data set.",
        "For example, (Tinsley et al., 2007) evaluated an unsupervised algorithm on 810 parsed English-French pairs annotated with subtree alignment.",
        "(Xiao and Zhu, 2013) also developed unsupervised subtree alignment methods (EM and Variational Bayes) and evaluated their automatic alignment model on 637 sentences from the Chinese TreeBank (and use the other 99 for tuning).",
        "(Sun et al., 2010b; Sun et al., 2010a) also report work on aligning subtrees and evaluate their impact on MT.",
        "However, we are not aware of any attempt to systematically harmonize word alignment with the alignment of phrases, or subtrees, or to systematically study the incompatibilities between parallel parse trees.",
        "1518 7 Conclusion In this paper we report our effort on the construction of a Chinese-English parallel treebank with both word-level and phrase-level alignments.",
        "When constructing the treebank, we systematically consider the interaction between word alignments and phrase alignments, and try to harmonize the two kinds of alignments by removing redundancies and incompatibilities between them.",
        "We show that this type of annotation can be performed with high inter-annotator consistency.",
        "Given our intention for the treebank to be a resource for MT, the next step is to synchronize the parallel parse trees, and of course, to perform automatic hierarchical alignment experiments and MT experiments.",
