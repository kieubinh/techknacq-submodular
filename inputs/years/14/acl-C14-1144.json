        "Epistemic modality, according to Palmer (2001), defines the speaker's subjective knowledge, beliefs and judgments about the world's states of affairs.",
        "Epistemic modality is used as a linguistic feature for multiple NLP tasks and applications, including sentiment analysis (Abdul-Mageed and Diab 2011), opinion mining (Benamara et al. 2012) and scientific discourse evaluation (Waard and Maat 2012), among others.",
        "To-date, there are no large-scale modality-annotated Arabic corpora compared to English (Baker et al. 2010, 2012; Rubinstein et al. 2013), Chinese (Cui and Chi 2013), Portuguese (Hendrickx et al. 2012) and Japanese (Matsuyoshi et al. 2010).",
        "The creation of modality-annotated corpora is non-trivial because there is no consensus definition of modality and its attributes in theoretical linguistics to be rendered into annotation tasks and guidelines.",
        "Furthermore, most current modality annotation schemes rely on sophisticated theoretically-grounded guidelines that require annotators from linguistics back-ground; hence, annotation is usually restricted to small-scale in-lab settings.",
        "In this paper, we present 3arif, a large-scale Arabic corpus annotated for epistemic modality.",
        "3arif comprises 9822 unique tweets in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Egyptian Arabic (EA), annotated for 9966 tokens that map to 214 unique types of epistemic modality.",
        "Each epistemic modality is annotated for sense, polarity, intensification, tense, holder(s) and scope(s).",
        "The reason that 3arif features the tweets' genre with an emphasis on MSA and EA tweets is that it comes as part of a larger project to incorporate linguistic features, such as modality, with network-based features to automatically identify the key players of Twitter's political discourse in counties of political unrest such as Egypt.",
        "We harvested 3arif from a variety of Twitter users including newspapers, TV stations, political campaigns, among others, as well as individuals.",
        "As a result 3arif is diglossic for MSA, the formal Arabic variety, and EA, the native Arabic dialect of Egypt.",
        "For the annotation of 3arif, we design a simplified procedure that depicts the following ideas: first, it defines each annotation task as a series of open and closed questions that do not require sophisticated linguistics background and, meanwhile, provide annotators with self-explanatory annotation guide-lines; second, it is interactive so that questions are displayed/hidden based on annotators' prior an-swers; and finally, it semi-automatically identifies and merges nested epistemic modality based on an-notators' answers to a number of easy-to-administer questions.",
        "1 Pronounced as ?a:rif in Arabic IPA and as EArif in Buckwalter's transliteration scheme.",
        "It means I/he know(s).",
        "2 3arif is available at http://www.rania-alsabbagh.com/3arif.html 1521 We evaluate our annotation results using Krippendorff's reliability (Krippendorff 2011) and agreement.",
        "Results show high inter-annotator reliability and agreement rates and indicate that our annotation scheme and procedure are efficient.",
        "The contribution of this research, therefore, is twofold: first, we create a novel resource for Arabic NLP which is expected to enhance research on modality automatic identification and extraction; second, we present an efficient and easy-to-administer annotation procedure with interactive crowdsourcing potentials for the complex task of modality annotation.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines our annotation scheme including annotation tasks, guidelines and the interactive structure; Section 3 gives examples for the representation of the final annotation outputs; Section 4 describes corpus harvesting and sampling; Section 5 discusses the results and presents a disagreement analysis; Section 6 compares and contrasts our work to related work; and Section 7 highlights the points not covered in this current version of 3arif.",
        "2 Annotation Scheme Our annotation scheme consists of six tasks to label sense, polarity, intensification, tense, holders and scopes for each epistemic modality.",
        "Prior to the beginning of the interactive annotation procedure, we highlighted all candidate epistemic modalities in each tweet using a string-match algorithm and the lexicons from Al-Sabbagh et al. (2013, 2014).",
        "The algorithm finds all potential epistemic modality triggers (i.e. words and phrases that may convey epistemic modality) within each tweet in our corpus and marks them as annotation units.",
        "A total of 9966 candidate epistemic modality triggers are highlighted in 9822 tweets.",
        "2.1 Task 1: Sense Sense annotation is to decide for each highlighted candidate trigger in context whether it actually conveys epistemic modality.",
        "The same lexical verb ????",
        "A$Er is used as an epistemic modality trigger anticipating a future possibility in example 1; but as a non-modal lexical verb in example 2.",

        "We define sense annotation as a synonymy judgment task, following Al-Sabbagh et al. (2013).",
        "Epistemic modality is represented by an exemplar set manually selected so that: (1) each exemplar is an unambiguous epistemic trigger, (2) exemplars are in both MSA and EA, (3) exemplars comprise both simple words and multiword expressions, (4) exemplars are both affirmative and negative, and (5) exemplars are of different lexical intensities.",
        "Furthermore, we create multiple versions of the same set so that we cover the inflections for gender, number, person, tense, mood, and aspect in Arabic.",
        "We then use the set that morphologically matches the candidate trigger to be annotated.",
        "Presented with a pre-highlighted candidate trigger in context and the exemplar set, annotators are to decide whether the given candidate trigger is synonymous to the exemplar set, and is hence an epistemic modality trigger, or not.",
        "If an annotator decides that a given candidate trigger does not convey epistemic modality, no further questions about polarity, intensification, tense, holders or scopes are displayed.",
        "To guarantee that annotators do not select the non-synonymous option as an easy escape, they are not allowed to move forward without submitting at least one synonym of their own to the candidate trigger.",
        "Designing the interactive procedure as such results in disagreement propagation.",
        "If one annotator decides that a given candidate trigger is not epistemic, but another annotator decides that it is, the former will not have to answer any further questions about polarity, intensification, tense, holders or scopes; whereas the latter will have to provide answers for each of those annotation tasks.",
        "3 Throughout the examples, epistemic modality triggers are represented in boldface and scopes are in-between square brackets.",
        "1522 2.2 Task 2: Polarity Task 2 uses as input the candidates labeled as valid epistemic modality triggers in Task 1 and labels each as either affirmative or negative.",
        "An affirmative trigger indicates that the speaker holds the given state of affairs (i.e. propositions) as TRUE; whereas a negative trigger indicates that the given propositions are held as FALSE by the speaker.",

        "mt>kd (I am/he is sure) expresses higher possibility than ???????",

        "EArf wmt>kd (I know and I am sure).",
        "The annotators' task for intensification is to decide for each candidate labeled as a valid epistemic modality trigger in Task 1 whether its lexical intensity is amplified (AMP), mitigated (MTG), or maintained (AS IS).",
        "During interactive annotation, annotators are asked to provide the reason for their selec-tion; that is, whether the lexical intensity is affected by an adverb, categorical negation, an emphatic expression, coordination, or any other reason.",
        "2.4 Task 4: Tense In this version of 3arif, we work on the present and past tenses only.",
        "Thus, Task 4 is to decide for each valid epistemic trigger from Task 1 whether it is present (PRS) or past (PST).",
        "Tense can be marked either morphologically by inflections and affixes or contextually by auxiliary verbs such as ???",
        "kAn (was), among others.",

        "Originally, their annotation scheme labels three attributes for each modality type: triggers, holders and targets (i.e. scopes).",
        "Yet, holders have not been eventually labeled.",
        "A unique feature of their annotation scheme is using a simplified operational procedure to label modality semantic meanings.",
        "The procedure relies on a list of thirteen choices of the form of H (modal) [P true/false] where H is a holder and P is a proposition or an event.",

        "8 Conclusion We presented 3arif, a large-scale corpus annotated for epistemic modality in MSA and EA tweets.",
        "We used a simplified approach that defines each annotation task as a series of questions, implemented interactively.",
