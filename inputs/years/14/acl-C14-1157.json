        "For example, the sentence in blue has a contrasting viewpoint compared to the other answers.",
        "Opinion summarization has previously been applied to restricted domains, such as product reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004; Lerman et al., 2009) and news (Stoyanov and Cardie, 2006), where the output summary is either presented in a structured way with respect to each aspect of the product or organized along contrastive viewpoints.",
        "Unlike those works, we address user generated online data: community QA and blogs.",
        "These forums use a substantially less formal language than news articles, and at the same time address a much broader spectrum of topics than product reviews.",
        "As a result, they present new challenges for automatic summarization.",

        "Hence, it would be beneficial to summarize answers automatically and present the summaries to users who ask similar questions in the future.",
        "In this work, we aim to return a summary that encapsulates different perspectives for a given opinion question and a set of relevant answers or documents.",
        "In our work we assume that there is a central topic (or query) on which a user is seeking diverse opinions.",
        "We predict query-relevance through automatically learned statistical rankers.",
        "Our ranking function not only aims to find sentences that are on the topic of the query but also ones that are ?opinionated?",
        "through the use of several features that indicate subjectivity and sentiment.",
        "The relevance score is encoded in a submodular function.",
        "Diversity is accounted for by a dispersion function that maximizes the pairwise distance between the pairs of sentences selected.",
        "Our chief contributions are: (1) We develop a submodular function-based framework for query-focused opinion summarization.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that submodular functions have been used to support opinion summarization.",
        "We test our framework on two tasks: summarizing opinionated sentences in community QA (Yahoo!",
        "Answers) and blogs (TAC-2008 corpus).",
        "Human evaluation using Amazon Mechanical Turk shows that our system generates the best summary 57.1% of the time.",
        "On the other hand, the best answer picked by Yahoo!",
        "users is chosen only 31.9% of the time.",
        "We also obtain significant higher Pyramid F1 score on the blog task as compared to the system of Lin and Bilmes (2011).",
        "(2) Within our summarization framework, the statistically learned sentence relevance is included as part of our objective function, whereas previous work on submodular summarization (Lin and Bilmes, 2011) only uses ngram overlap for query relevance.",
        "Additionally, we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003) to model the topic structure of the sentences, and induce clusterings according to the learned topics.",
        "Therefore, our system is capable of generating summaries with broader topic coverage.",
        "(3) Furthermore, we are the first to study how different metrics for computing text similarity or dissimilarity affect the quality of submodularity-based summarization methods.",
        "We show empirically that lexical representation-based similarity, such as TFIDF scores, uniformly outperforms semantic similarity computed with WordNet.",
        "Moreover, when measuring the summary diversity, topical representation is marginally better than lexical representation, and both of them beats semantic representation.",
        "2 Related Work Our work falls in the realm of query-focused summarization, where a user asks a question and the system generates a summary of the answers containing pertinent and diverse information.",
        "A wide range of methods have been investigated, where relevance is often estimated through TF-IDF similarity (Car- bonell and Goldstein, 1998), topic signature words (Lin and Hovy, 2000) or by learning a Bayesian model over queries and documents (Daum?e and Marcu, 2006).",
        "Most work only implicitly penalizes summary redundancy, e.g. by downweighting the importance of words that are already selected.",
        "Encouraging diversity of a summary has recently been addressed through submodular functions, which have been applied for multi-document summarization in newswire (Lin and Bilmes, 2011; Sipos et al., 2012), and comments summarization (Dasgupta et al., 2013).",
        "However, these works either ignore the query information (when available) or else use simple ngram matching between the query and sentences.",
        "In contrast, we propose to optimize an objective function that addresses both relevance and diversity.",
        "Previous work on generating opinion summaries mainly considers product reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004; Lerman et al., 2009), and formal texts such as news articles (Stoyanov and Cardie, 2006) or editorials (Paul et al., 2010).",
        "Mostly, there is no query information, and summaries are formulated in a structured way based on product features or contrastive standpoints.",

        "In this paper, we follow the same assumption and work with non-decreasing submodular functions.",
        "Nevertheless, they have limitations, one of which is that functions well suited to modeling diversity are not submodular.",
        "Recently, Dasgupta et al. (2013) proved that diversity can nonetheless be encoded in well-designed dispersion functions which still maintain a constant factor approximation when solved by a greedy algorithm.",
        "Based on these considerations, we propose an objective function f(S) mainly considering three as-pects: relevance (Section 3.1), coverage (Section 3.2), and non-redundancy (Section 3.3).",

        "Topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) and its variants are able to discover hidden topics or aspects of document col-lections, and thus afford a natural way to cluster texts according to their topics.",
        "Recent work (Xie and Xing, 2013) shows the effectiveness of utilizing topic models for newsgroup document clustering.",
        "We first learn an LDA model from the data, and treat each topic as a cluster.",
        "We estimate a sentence-topic distribution ~ ?",
