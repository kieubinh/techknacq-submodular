        "The summary by our proposed method, in contrast, organizes the information into sections and has a high coverage of places a tourist can visit.",

        "Second, we propose a principled approach based on latent variable models and Integer Linear Programming.",
        "Third, we evaluate our method using real forum threads and human generated model summaries, and the results are positive.",
        "2 Overview of Our Method Our task is to summarize travel-related information from forum threads for potential tourists.",
        "In order to inject some structure into the generated summaries, we assume that we have a set of I well-written travel guides that correspond to I different cities and have the same structure.",
        "We refer to these travel guides as official travel guides.",
        "Each official travel guide consists of a fixed set of S sections such as restaurants and shopping, and this section structure will be used to organize our generated summaries.",
        "We further assume that each section of an official travel guide consists of a list of points of interest, each with a name and a short description, as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "We believe that this is a fairly common structure followed by many if not all travel guides.",
        "Given a target city, we assume that we can collect a set of threads about this city from travel-related forums.",
        "In this paper we use threads from Yahoo!",
        "Answers, but our solution does not use any CQA properties of the threads, so threads from other general forums can also be used.",
        "Our goal is to generate a text summary with S sections from these threads, where each section has a length limit.",
        "1671 As we have mentioned, we treat the problem as a multi-document summarization task.",
        "However, different from standard text summarization, our generated summaries should contain S sections.",
        "To achieve this goal, we first select a set of relevant threads for each section and then perform section-specific summarization from the selected threads.",
        "Thread selection: To select relevant threads given a section, a naive solution is to rank the threads based on their relevance to the section, where relevance can be measured by, for example, cosine similarity between a thread and all the text in the given travel guides belonging to the section.",
        "But we observe that the language used in forum threads could be very different from that in the official travel guides, making it hard to measure relevance purely based on lexical overlap.",
        "For example, in the entertainment section, forum threads may contain words such as ?djs,?",
        "?Xmas,?",
        "?b?day?",
        "and ?anni.",
        "?, but these words do not occur in the official travel guides.",
        "To overcome this difficulty, we propose to use a latent variable model that jointly models official travel guides and forum threads.",
        "We treat the S sections as S latent factors that govern the generation of the forum threads.",
        "With the latent factors observed in the official travel guides, we receive some supervision; and yet by jointly modeling both the official travel guides and the forum threads, we allow the latent factors to adapt to the lexical variations in user-generated content.",
        "In the end, the learned latent factors can help us align forum threads with the sections and subsequently select the most relevant ones for each section.",
        "Section-specific summarization: Given the selected relevant threads for a section, we adopt an ILP-based extractive summarization framework that has been shown to be effective (Gillick and Favre, 2009).",
        "We modify the objective function in this framework to consider two factors: (1) Since not every sentence in the selected threads is highly relevant to the section, we want to give preference to those more relevant sentences in the objective function, where relevance can be measured using word distributions learned by the latent variable model.",
        "(2) Since travel guides are expected to recommend points of interest to readers, we try to maximize the coverage of section-specific location entities in the objective function.",
        "3 Joint City Section Model 3.1 Model In this section we present our Joint City Section Model (JCSM), which links official travel guides and forum threads.",
        "The model is a typical extension of LDA, where a number of latent topics (i.e. latent factors) are assumed to have generated the observed text.",
        "First of all, for each pre-defined section there is a latent topic.",
        "These explain words such as ?food?",
        "and ?menu?",
        "for restaurants and ?store?",
        "and ?mall?",
        "for shopping.",
        "In addition, in both travel guides and forum threads, some words are more related to the city being discussed than any specific section.",
        "For example, when New York City is being discussed, words such as ?NYC?",
        "and ?Manhattan?",
        "may frequently show up in any section.",
        "We therefore further assume that for each city there is a city-specific topic.",
        "A switch variable is used to determine whether a word comes from a city-specific or section-specific topic.",
        "A special design of our model that differs from many existing LDA extensions is the treatment of named entities.",
        "We first use a named entity recognizer to identify potential names of locations from forum threads.",
        "We assume that each of these entities belongs to a section, which is indicated by a latent variable.",
        "We then assume that the section labels of the non-entity words in forum threads are dependent on the section labels of these entities.",
        "By doing so, we emphasize the importance of associating potential points of interest with sections, which will be useful when we generate summaries.",
        "We now formally present JCSM.",
        "To simplify the model description, we assume that we work with I cities, each of which has a given, well-written travel guide and a set of forum threads.",
        "Note that in practice this model can be easily extended such that a target city with forum threads does not need to have a given travel guide to begin with.",
