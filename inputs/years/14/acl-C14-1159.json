        "Medical relation (MR) classification, an information extraction task in the clinical domain that was recently defined in the 2010 i2b2/VA Challenge (Uzuner et al., 2011), involves determining the relation between a pair of medical concepts (problems, treatments, or tests).",
        "The ability to classify MRs is indispensable to sound automatic analysis of patient health records.",
        "While MR classification is a relatively new task, there has been a lot of work on extracting semantic relations from news articles.",
        "Supervised approaches train classifiers on data annotated with the target relation types, typically using a rich feature set (Zhou et al., 2005; Surdeanu and Ciaramita, 2007; Zhou et al., 2007).",
        "Since obtaining annotated data is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, researchers have considered unsupervised approaches (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006; Banko et al., 2007).",
        "While unsupervised approaches can use a large amount of unannotated data and extract a large number of relations, it may not be easy to map the resulting relations to those needed for a given knowledge base.",
        "One way to mitigate this problem is semi-supervised learning: starting from a given set of seed instances, a bootstrapping algorithm is used to iteratively learn extraction patterns and extract instances (Brin, 1999; Riloff and Jones, 1999; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Etzioni et al., 2005; Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006; Bunescu and Mooney, 2007; Rozenfeld and Feldman, 2008).",
        "However, the resulting patterns often suffer from semantic drift and low precision.",
        "Recent years have seen a surge of interest in distant supervision for relation extraction (Mintz et al., 2009; Nguyen and Moschitti, 2011; Krause et al., 2012; Min et al., 2013).",
        "The idea is to automatically create annotated relation instances by extracting their labels from relation instances in a knowledge base such as Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008) and YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007).",
        "Our goal in this paper is to advance the state of the art in MR classification.",
        "One of the major challenges in MR classification is the scarcity of labeled data.",
        "At first glance, we can mitigate this problem using distant supervision approaches.",
        "However, there is difficulty in applying these approaches to MR classification: only one of the relation types defined in the 2010 i2b2 Challenge is represented in the Unified Medical Language System 1 , the most comprehensive medical ontology available to date.",
        "In light of this difficulty, we propose an ensemble approach to MR classification, where we exploit human-supplied knowledge to guide the design of different members of the ensemble.",
        "Unlike state-of-the-art supervised approaches to this task, which represent contextual information largely as flat (i.e., This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "1 www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/ 1682 discrete-or real-valued) features (de Bruijn et al., 2011; Rink et al., 2011) or structured tree features (Zhu et al., 2013), we represent contexts as sequences, specifically word sequences and dependency sequences, and use them to derive lexical and dependency patterns.",
        "Our ensemble approach exploits human-supplied knowledge in three ways.",
        "First, while existing approaches employ similarity functions already defined in off-the-shelf learning algorithms (e.g., linear kernel (Rink et al., 2011), tree kernel (Zhu et al., 2013)) to compute the similarity between two relation instances, we define functions to compare the similarity between two patterns.",
        "Second, to complement the automatically induced patterns, we hand-craft patterns based on manual observations made on the training set, specifically by having a human identify the contexts of two concepts that are strongly indicative of a medical relation class.",
        "Finally, we employ human knowledge to identify the constraints on the classification of different relation instances, and enforce the resulting constraints in an integer linear programming (ILP) framework.",
        "Evaluation results on the 2010 i2b2/VA Challenge corpus (henceforth the i2b2 corpus) show that our ensemble approach yields a 19.8% relative error reduction over a state-of-the-art system.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 provides an overview of the i2b2 corpus.",
        "Section 3 describes the baseline systems.",
        "Sections 4 and 5 describe our new components and our ensemble approach.",
        "Section 6 discusses our constraints for enforcing global consistency.",
        "We present evaluation results in Section 7, conduct an error analysis in Section 8, and conclude in Section 9.",
        "2 Corpus For evaluation, we use the i2b2 corpus, which comprises 426 de-identified discharge summaries.",
        "We adopt the i2b2 organizers?",
        "partition of the 426 summaries into a training set (170 summaries) and a test set (256 summaries).",
        "As many of the algorithms in our approach require parameter tuning, we reserve 30 of the 170 summaries in the training set for development purposes.",
        "In each discharge summary, the concepts and the medical relation between each pair of concepts are marked up.",
        "Each concept is annotated with a type attribute that indicates whether it is a TEST, a PROBLEM, or a TREATMENT.",
        "In addition, a PROBLEM concept has an assertion attribute, which specifies whether the problem was present, absent, or possible in the patient, conditionally present in the patient under certain circumstances, hypothetically present in the patient at some future point, or mentioned in the patient report but associated with someone other than the patient.",
        "Eleven types of intra-sentential pairwise relations are annotated.",
        "A brief description of these relation types and the relevant statistics are provided in Table 1.",
        "As we can see from the table, each medical relation has a type and is defined only on intra-sentence TREATMENT-PROBLEM, TEST-PROBLEM, and PROBLEM-PROBLEM concept pairs.",
        "Also, while there are 11 relation types, three of them, namely Relations 6, 9, and 11, denote the absence of a medical relation between the corresponding concepts.",
        "The purpose of having ?no relation?",
        "classes is to ensure that every pair of TEST/PROBLEM/TREATMENT concepts is annotated, whether or not a medical relation exists between them.",
        "3 Baseline MR Classification Systems We employ two supervised MR classification systems as baselines.",
        "The first baseline is a state-of-the-art system that achieved the best performance in the official 2010 i2b2 evaluation.",
        "The second baseline is a tree kernel-based system, motivated by the fact that tree kernels are frequently used in relation extraction (e.g., Zhou et al. (2007), Zhu et al. (2013)).",
        "3.1 SVM with Flat Features Our first baseline, Rink et al.'s (2011) system, employs an SVM classifier trained on a set of flat features (i.e., features that are discrete-or real-valued).",
        "Following Rink et al., we create training instances as follows.",
        "First, we form training instances between every pair of (PROBLEM, TEST, and TREATMENT) concepts in the training documents, labeling an instance with its relation type.",
        "Since the instances belonging to the three ?no relation?",
        "classes significantly outnumber those belonging to the remaining eight classes, we reduce data skew by downsampling 1683 Id Relation Example Total (%) 1 TrIP: Treatment improves medical problem Her pain resolved after surgery 203 (0.6) 2 TrWP: Treatment worsens medical problem treated with Zofran with no relief 133 (0.4) 3 TrCP: Treatment causes medical problem Transdermal nitroglycerin caused headache 526 (1.8) 4 TrAP: Treatment is administered for medical problem start on Decadron 4 mg q6 to prevent swelling 2613 (8.9) 5 TrNAP: Treatment is not administered because of medical problem His Avandia was discontinued secondary to the side effect profile 174 (0.6) 6 NTrP: No relation between treatment and problem with sutures intact and no erythema or purulence noted .",
        "4462 (15.2) 7 TeRP: Test reveals medical problem A postoperative MRI revealed no remarkable findings 3051 (10.4) 8 TeCP: Test conducted to investigate medical problem An ultrasound was done to rule out cholestasis 504 (1.7) 9 NTeP: No relation between test and problem Throughout the stay his labs remained normal and his pain controlled .",
        "2964 (10.1) 10 PIP: Medical problem indicates medical problem with a moderate-sized , dense , fixed inferior defect indicative of scar 2202 (7.5) 11 NPP: No relation between paired medical problems He is somewhat cantankerous and demanding of the nurses .",
        "12503 (42.6) Table 1: The 11 relation types for medical relation classification.",
        "Each relation type is defined on an ordered pair where concepts in the pair are as specified by the relation.",
        "The ?Total?",
        "and ?%?",
        "columns show the number and percentage of instances annotated with the corresponding relation type over all 426 discharge summaries, respectively.",
        "instances belonging to the three ?no relation?",
        "classes.",
        "2 Specifically, we downsample the instances belonging to the three ?no relation?",
        "classes (i.e., NTrP, NTeP, and NPP) by ensuring that (1) the ratio of the number of NTrP instances to the number of TREATMENT-PROBLEM instances is 0.06; (2) the ratio of the number of NTeP instances to the number of TEST-PROBLEM instances is 0.03; and (3) the ratio of the number of NPP instances to the number of PROBLEM-PROBLEM instances is 0.5.",
        "These ratios are selected using our 30-summary development set, as described in Section 2.",
        "As mentioned above, each instance corresponds to a pair of concepts, c 1 and c 2 , and is represented using 37 groups of features that can be divided into five categories: 3 Context (13 groups).",
        "The words, the POS tags, the bigrams, the string of words, the sequence of phrase chunk types, and the concept types used between c 1 and c 2 ; the word preceding c 1 /c 2 ; any of the three words succeeding c 1 /c 2 ; the predicates associated with c 1 /c 2 ; the predicates associated with both concepts; and a feature that indicates whether a conjunction regular expression matched the string of words between c 1 and c 2 .",
        "Similarity (5 groups).",
        "We find the concept pairs in the training set that are most similar to the (c 1 ,c 2 ) pair (i.e., its nearest neighbors), and create features that encode the statistics collected from these nearest neighbors.",
        "To find the nearest neighbors, we (1) represent each pair in the training set as a sequence; (2) define the number of nearest neighbors to use; and (3) define a similarity metric to compute the similarity of two sequences.",
        "Following Rink et al. (2011), we employ five methods to represent a pair.",
        "The five methods are: (1) as a sequence of POS tags for the entire sentence containing the pair; (2) as a phrase chunk sequence between the two concepts; (3) as a word lemma sequence beginning the two words before the first concept, up to and including the second word following the second concept in the pair; (4) as a concept type sequence for all the concepts found in the sentence containing the pair; and (5) as a shortest dependency path sequence connecting the two concepts.",
        "Table 2 shows an example of these five methods of generating sequences from the TEST concept her exam and the PROBLEM concept her hyperreflexia in the sentence 2 Other methods for addressing class imbalance, such as over-sampling (Chawla et al., 2002) and cost-sensitive learning (Turney, 1995), can also be employed.",
        "3 To compute the features, we use (1) the Stanford CoreNLP tool (Manning et al., 2014) to obtain POS tags, word lemmas, and dependency structures; (2) GENIA (http://www.nactem.ac.uk/tsujii/GENIA/tagger) to obtain phrase chunks; and (3) SENNA (Collobert et al., 2011) to obtain predicate-argument structures.",
        "1684 Generation Method Sequence (1) RB VB , test c1 RB VBD RB IN problem c2 .",
        "(2) ADVP VP ADVP PP (3) postop , test c1 only improve slightly in problem c2 .",
        "(4) test c1 problem c2 (5) test c1 ?nsubj?> prep <?pobj?problem c2 Table 2: Examples of the five methods of sequence generation.",
        "Postop, her exam only improved slightly in her hyperreflexia .",
        "Note that for better generalization, the two concepts are replaced with their concept type (i.e., her exam and her hyperreflexia are replaced with test c1 and problem c2 respectively) before sequence generation.",
        "Like Rink et al., we seek different numbers of nearest neighbors for the five methods of generating sequences.",
        "For the first method, we use 100 nearest neighbors; for the second method, 15 neighbors; for the third method, 20 neighbors; for the fourth method, 100 neighbors; and for the fifth method, 20 neighbors.",
        "We use the Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein, 1966) as the similarity metric.",
        "After finding the nearest neighbors for each of the five methods of sequence representation, we create features as follows.",
        "For each method, we compute the percentage of nearest neighbors belonging to each of the 11 relation types, and then create 11 features whose values are these 11 numbers.",
        "Single concept (11 groups).",
        "Any word lemma from c 1 /c 2 ; any word used to describe c 1 /c 2 ; the concept type for c 1 /c 2 ; the string of words in c 1 /c 2 ; the concatenation of assertion types for both concepts; and the sentiment category (i.e., positive or negative) of c 1 /c 2 obtained from the General Inquirer lexicon (Stone et al., 1968).",
        "Wikipedia (6 groups).",
        "Six features are computed based on the Wikipedia articles, their categories, and the links between them.",
        "The first feature encodes whether neither c 1 nor c 2 contains any substring that may be matched against the title of an article.",
        "The second feature encodes whether the links between the articles retrieved based on the two concepts are absent.",
        "The next two features encode whether a link exists from the article pertaining to c 1 (c 2 ) to the article pertaining to c 2 (c 1 ).",
        "The fifth feature encodes whether there are links between the articles pertaining to both concepts.",
        "The last feature encodes whether both concepts have the same concept type according to their Wikipedia categories.",
        "Vicinity (2 groups).",
        "The concatenation of the type of c 1 and the type of the closest concept preceding c 1 ; and the concatenation of the type of c 2 and the type of the closest concept succeeding c 2 .",
        "After creating the training instances, we train a 11-class classifier on them using SVM multiclass (Tsochantaridis et al., 2004).",
        "We set C, the regularization parameter, to 10,000, since preliminary experiments indicate that preferring generalization to overfitting (by setting C to a small value) tends to yield poorer classification performance.",
        "The remaining learning parameters are set to their default values.",
        "After training, we use the resulting classifier to make predictions on the test instances, which are generated in the same way as the training instances.",
        "3.2 SVM with Structured Feature In this framework, each instance is represented using a single structured feature computed from the parse tree of the sentence containing the concept pair.",
        "Since publicly available SVM learners capable of handling structured features can only make binary predictions, we train 11 SVM classifiers, one for representing each medical relation.",
        "In each classifier's training data, a positive instance is one whose class value matches the medical relation class value of the classifier, and a negative instance is one with other class values applicable to the given concept pair.",
        "Since the negative instances significantly outnumber the positive instances in each of these binary classifiers, we reduce data skew by downsampling the negative instances.",
        "Following the order of the 11 relations listed in Table 1, the optimal ratios of negative-to-positive instances according to our 30-summary development set are 0.2, 0.2, 0.06, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 1, 0.3, 0.06, 0.06, and 0.09, respectively.",
        "We set C to 100 based on the development data.",
        "While we want to use a parse tree directly as a feature for representing an instance, we do not want to use the entire parse tree as a feature.",
        "Specifically, while using the entire parse tree enables a richer 1685 representation of the syntactic context of the two concepts than using a partial parse tree, the increased complexity of the tree also makes it more difficult for the SVM learner to make generalizations.",
        "To strike a better balance between having a rich representation of the context and improving the learner's ability to generalize, we extract a subtree from a parse tree and use it as the value of the structured feature of an instance.",
        "Specifically, given two concepts in an instance and the associated syntactic parse tree T , we retain as our subtree the portion of T that covers (1) all the nodes lying on the shortest path between the two entities, and (2) all the immediate children of these nodes that are not the leaves of T .",
        "This subtree is known as a simple expansion tree.",
        "After training the 11 tree kernel-based relation classifiers, we can apply them to classify a test instance.",
        "The class value of an instance is determined based on the classifier with the maximum classification confidence, where the confidence value of an instance is its signed distance from the SVM hyperplane.",
        "4 Exploiting Sequences for MR Classification Unlike the two baselines, which exploit flat features and parse-based structured features for MR classifi-cation, in this section we describe three MR classification systems that exploit sequences.",
        "4.1 Dependency-Based Sequences The first system is based on sequences of dependency relations.",
        "To see why dependency relations could be useful for MR classification, consider the sentences in Table 3: (1) (2) Table 3: Example dependency paths.",
        "In sentences (1) and (2), the PROBLEM concepts His pain and The patient's pain occur as the subject of the verb controlled and the TREATMENT concepts oral medication and Motrin occur as objects of the prepositional with modifier of the same verb controlled.",
        "In other words, intuitively, the verb controlled cues that the PROBLEM concept is being controlled, and together with the preposition with it cues that the TREATMENT concept is doing the controlling.",
        "Note that in each case the relation between the PROBLEM and TREATMENT is TrIP, which can now be easily inferred given the dependency relations of the concept pairs with the verb controlled.",
        "These examples suggest that the verb closest to each of the two concepts is an important word as it cues the relation.",
        "Given the usefulness of dependency structures and the verb closest to each concept for MR classifica-tion, we represent each training/test instance as a paired dependency sequence with separate dependency paths traced from each concept in the pair to its closest verb.",
        "To reduce data sparsity, for the argument words found in a dependency path, we replace them with their POS tags.",
        "For example, given sentence (1), the path extracted from His pain is ?nsubjpass ( controlled NN )?",
        "and from oral medication is ?prep ( controlled with ) pobj ( with NN )?.",
        "4 Next, we describe how to classify a test instance inst.",
        "First, we identify the set of training instances T that satisfy two conditions: (a) the ancestor verb pair in the training instance is the same as that in inst, and (b) each of the two dependency sequences in the training instance either is the same as, or contains, or is contained in the corresponding dependency sequences in inst.",
        "Second, we find for inst its nearest neighbor in T by employing the following similarity function: Similarity(train, test) = cosine(path train c 1 , path test c 1 ) ?",
        "cosine(path train c 2 , path test c 2 ) (1) 4 Note that sometimes a dependency path cannot be traced (e.g., a verb does not exist, which is not uncommon in a discharge report) for a given concept pair.",
        "If this happens, no instance will be generated from the concept pair.",
        "1686 where cosine(x, y) is a function that computes the cosine similarity of x and y.",
        "5 Finally, if the similarity between inst and its nearest neighbor in T is greater than a threshold, we classify inst using the class value of its nearest neighbor.",
        "6 Otherwise, this system will leave inst unclassified.",
        "In other words, this system is precision-oriented, classifying only those instances it can classify confidently.",
        "4.2 Lexical Patterns In our second system, we represent each concept pair as a lexical pattern.",
        "Specifically, we employ Generation Method 3 as described in the Similarity features in Section 3.1 to generate a lexical pattern from a concept pair.",
        "To classify a test instance inst, we employ the one-nearest-neighbor algorithm.",
        "To identify the nearest neighbor of inst, we employ the Levenshtein distance as the similarity metric.",
        "Two questions naturally arise.",
        "First, since these lexical patterns have already been used to generate features in the flat-feature baseline, why do we still employ them in a separate system?",
        "To answer this question, note that although these lexical patterns were used to generate features for training the flat-feature baseline classifier, we have no control over whether these features are deemed useful by the learning algorithm and are subsequently used by the resulting classifier.",
        "Having a separate system that employs these patterns ensures that they will be used when making the final classification decision.",
        "Second, given that we described five methods to generate sequences in Section 3.1, why do we employ Generation Method 3 but not the remaining methods?",
        "In principle, we can employ the remaining four generation methods for generating lexical patterns as well: all we need to do is to create four additional systems, each of which makes use of the patterns created by exactly one of the four methods.",
        "In prac-tice, however, not all generation methods are equally good: if a method does not generate patterns that adequately capture context, then employing the resulting patterns may yield poor-performing systems.",
        "Consequently, we employ only the system corresponding to the generation method that yields the best performance on the development data, which turns out to be the system corresponding to Method 3.",
        "4.3 Rules In the previous subsection, we employ automatically induced patterns.",
        "In contrast, our third system employs patterns that are hand-crafted based on manual observations made on the training set.",
        "Specifically, we ask a human to identify the contexts of two concepts that are strongly indicative of a relation class.",
        "Like the automatically induced patterns, each hand-crafted pattern is composed of the types of the two concepts involved and the context in which they occur.",
        "For example, in the pattern due to PROBLEM by TREATMENT, the TREATMENT is likely to cause the PROBLEM and therefore it will be labeled as TrCP.",
        "As another example, in the pattern attributed to PROBLEM as a result of PROBLEM, the two PROBLEMs are likely to have an indicative relation and therefore it will be labeled as PIP.",
        "At the end of this process, we end up with 136 manually labeled patterns, which we will subsequently refer to as a ruleset.",
        "Next, we order these rules in decreasing order of accuracy, where the accuracy of a rule is defined as the number of times it yields the correct MR type divided by the number of times it is applied, as measured on the training set.",
        "Given this ruleset, we can classify a test instance using the first applicable rule in it.",
        "If no rules are applicable, the test instance will remain unclassified.",
        "7 5 The Ensemble In the previous section, we described three systems for MR classification.",
        "Together with the two baseline systems, we have five systems for MR classification.",
        "A natural way to make use of all of them for MR classification is to include them in an ensemble.",
        "The question, then, is: how do we classify a test instance using this ensemble?",
        "The simplest approach is perhaps majority voting, but that presumes that each 5 To apply cosine similarity, we represent each path as a frequency-count vector, where each dimension in the vector corresponds to a dependency type or an argument word appearing in the path.",
        "6 Based on development set experiments, the similarity threshold values for each concept pair type are: T Treatment?Problem = 0.85; T Test?Problem = 0.75; and T Problem?Problem = 0.75.",
        "7 Space limitations preclude a complete listing of these rules.",
        "See our website at https://www.hlt.utdallas.edu/ ?",
        "jld082000/medical-relations/ for the complete list of rules.",
        "1687 member of the ensemble is equally important.",
        "In practice, however, some members are more important than the others, so the votes cast by these members should have higher weights.",
        "To model this observation, we combine the (probabilistic) votes of the members in a weighted fashion using the following formula: P combined (c) = w 1 ?",
        "P tree (c) + w 2 ?",
        "P flat (c) + w 3 ?",
        "P dependency (c) + w 4 ?",
        "P word (c) + w 5 ?",
        "P rules (c) (2) where w i (i = 1, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", 5) is a combination weight, and P x (c) is the probability that the test instance belongs to class c according to system x.",
        "Two questions naturally arise.",
        "First, how can the combination weights be determined?",
        "We perform an exhaustive search on held-out development data to find the combination of weights that jointly maximizes overall accuracy on the development set.",
        "We allow each weight to vary between 0 and 1 in steps of 0.1, subject to the constraint that the five weights sum to 1.",
        "Second, how can P x (c) be computed?",
        "In other words, how can each system compute the probability that a given test instance belongs to a certain class?",
        "To answer this question, we have to convert the output of each system for each test instance into a 11-element probability vector, which is used to encode the probability that the given test instance belongs to each of the 11 relation types.",
        "We perform the conversion as follows.",
        "For the two baseline systems, the SVM outputs a confidence value for each class.",
        "Hence, to obtain the probability vector, we first normalize the confidence value associated with each class so that it falls within the [0,1] range, and then normalize the resulting values so that they sum to 1.",
        "For the systems employing lexical patterns and dependency-based sequences, the class chosen by each system receives a probability of 0.6, and each of the other classes applicable to the test instance under consideration receives an equal share of the remaining probability mass.",
        "For the rule-based system, we take the rule that is used to classify the test instance and apply this rule to each instance in the training set to estimate the probability that the rule is correct with respect to each of the 11 classes.",
        "We can then use the resulting 11 probabilities to create the 11-element probability vector.",
        "Finally, recall that some of these systems are not applicable to all of the test instances.",
        "If this happens, the corresponding system(s) will return a vector in which all of its elements are set to 0.",
        "6 Enforcing Global Consistency So far we have had an ensemble that, given a test instance, returns the probability that it belongs to each of the 11 classes.",
        "Since the test instances are classified independently of each other, there is no guarantee that the resulting classifications are globally consistent.",
        "To enforce global consistency, we employ global constraints implemented in the Integer Linear Programming (ILP) framework (Roth and Yih, 2004).",
        "Since our constraints are intra-sentential, we formulate one ILP program for each sentence s in each training summary.",
        "Each ILP program contains 11?N s variables, whereN s is the number of test instances formed from the concept pairs in s. In other words, there is one binary indicator variable x i,j,r for each relation class r of each test instance inst formed from concept i and concept j, which will be set to 1 by the ILP solver if and only if it thinks inst should belong to class r. Our objective is to maximize the linear combination of these variables and their corresponding probabilities given by the ensemble (see (3) below) subject to two types of constraints, the integrity constraints and the consistency constraints.",
        "The integrity constraints ensure that each concept pair is assigned exactly one relation type (see the equality constraint in (4)).",
