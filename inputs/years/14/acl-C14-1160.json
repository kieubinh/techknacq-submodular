        "An important bottleneck for automatic discourse understanding is the proper identification of implicit relations between discourse units.",
        "What makes these relations difficult is that they lack strong surface cues like a discourse marker.",
        "This point is illustrated in the French examples (1) and (2).",
        "1 In (1), the connective mais (but) triggers a relation of contrast, whereas in (2), there is no explicit connective to signal the explanation relation, and the relation has to be inferred through other ways (in this case, a causal relation between having injured players and loosing).",
        "(1) La hulotte est un rapace nocturne, mais elle peut vivre le jour.",
        "The tawny owl is a nocturnal bird of prey, but it can live in the daytime.",
        "(2) L?",
        "?quipe a perdu lamentablement hier.",
        "Elle avait trop de bless?s.",
        "The team lost miserably yesterday.",
        "It had too many injured players.",
        "Implicit relations are very widespread in naturally-occurring data.",
        "Thus, they make up between 39.5% and 54% of the annotated examples in the Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008), depending on the relation types used.",
        "2 A quick look at other discourse corpora suggests that the problem is as pervasive (if not more) in other languages.",
        "The French ANNODIS corpus does not annotate the distinction between explicit and implicit relations, but a projection of a French connective lexicon on the data gives a proportion of 47.4 to 71% of implicit relations, depending on the set of relations.",
        "3 For the German discourse corpus of (Gastel et al., 2011), (Versley, 2013) report 65% of implicit relations.",
        "In this paper, we tackle the problem of automatically identifying implicit discourse relations in French.",
        "To date, the large majority of studies on this task have focused on English, and to a lesser extent on German.",
        "Performance remain relatively low compared to explicit relations, due to the lack of strong This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "1 All our examples are taken from the ANNODIS corpus: http://redac.univ-tlse2.fr/corpus/annodis/.",
        "2 The former count does not include AltLex, EntRel and NoRel as implicit examples, whereas the latter does.",
        "3 The first count does not include attribution, e-elaboration and frame examples.",
        "1694 predictors.",
        "Because it relies on more complex, interacting factors, the identification of implicit relations requires a lot of data.",
        "But the available annotated for French is scarce: while the PDTB contains about 40, 000 examples, the French ANNODIS only has about 3, 000 examples.",
        "An additional challenge for building such a system for French compared to English is the lack of external lexical ressources (e.g., semantic verb classification, polarity database).",
        "A natural approach to deal with the lack of annotated implicit data is to resort to additional data automatically obtained from explicit examples in which the connective is removed (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002).",
        "Provided that one could reliably identify discourse connectives, this approach makes it possible to create large amounts of additional implicit data from raw texts.",
        "Unfortunately, (Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008) show that a system trained on this type of artificially generated data does not generalize well, leading to important performance degradation compared to a system solely trained on natural data.",
        "The central question we address in this paper is how to better leverage the large amount of automatically generated data.",
        "We first show that the bad generalization performance of the system trained on artificial data lies in important distribution differences between the two datasets.",
        "This analysis in turn leads us to investigate various simple schemes for combining natural and artificial data methods inspired from the field of domain adaptation.",
        "Our best combined system yields a significant improvement of 4.4% over a system solely trained on the available manually annotated data.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 summarizes previous works on implicit relation identification.",
        "In section 3, we describe the problems introduced by the use of artificial data and the methods we develop to deal with them.",
        "In section 4, we give a description of the data used, and in section 5, we detail our feature set.",
        "Our experiments are then summarized in section 6.",
        "2 Related Work To date, there have been only a few attempts at building full document-based discourse parsers.",
        "On the RST-DT (Carlson et al., 2001), the best performing system is (Joty et al., 2013), who report an F 1 score of 55.71 for labeled stuctures (with 23 relations).",
        "On the same corpus, (Sagae, 2009) and (Hernault et al., 2010) report F 1 scores of 44.5 and 47.3, respectively.",
        "On the PDTB, the parser of Lin et al. (2010) obtains an F 1 score of 33 (16 explicit relations, 11 implicit relations).",
        "On the ANNODIS corpus, Muller et al. (2012) reports F 1 scores of 36.1 (17 relations) and 46.8 (4 relations).",
        "These still modest performance are due to wrong attachment decisions, as well as to errors in relation labeling.",
        "Most of these latter errors are mostly imputable to wrong classifications of implicit relations.",
        "Thus, the current best accuracy performance on explicit PDTB relations are 94.15% on 4 relations (Pitler and Nenkova, 2009), and 86.77% on 16 relations (Lin et al., 2010).",
        "By contrast, the best identification system for implicit PDTB relations obtains an accuracy of 65.4% on 4 relations in (Pitler et al., 2009), and down to 40.2% for 11 of the level 2 relations of PDTB (Lin et al., 2009).",
        "For German, Versley (2013)'s study on implicit relations reports 42.5 in F 1 for 5 relations and 18.7 for 21 relations.",
        "For French, Muller et al. (2012) report an accuracy score of 63.6% for their relation labeling system (over 17 relations), but they do not provide separate scores for explicit vs. implicit relations.",
        "This performance drop reflects the difficulty of identifying a rhetorical relation in the absence of an explicit discourse marker.",
        "As shown by (Park and Cardie, 2012), the identification of implicit relations relies on more diverse and noisy predictors from syntax (in the form of prediction rules) and (lexical) semantics (e.g., polarity, semantic classes and fine-grained semantic tags for verbs).",
        "Unfortunately, most of the semantic resources used to derive features for English (polarity database, Inquirer tags) are not available for French.",
        "Zhou et al. (2010) try to predict the implicit connectives annotated in the PDTB as a way of predicting the relation, a method only possible with this corpus.",
        "They obtain results lower than those reported by (Park and Cardie, 2012).",
        "In another context, Sporleder (2008) shows that using WordNet is less effective than lemmatisation for capturing semantic generalization, and (Wang et al., 2010) use tree kernels in order to better capture important syntactic information.",
        "In another context, Sporleder (2008) shows that using WordNet is less effective than lemmatisation for capturing semantic generalization, and (Wang et al., 2010) use tree kernels in order to better capture important syntactic information.",
        "1695 Another set of studies we directly build upon explore the idea that many connectives unambiguously trigger a unique relation, thus allowing to construct massive amount of (artificially) labelled implicit examples from raw data.",
        "Marcu and Echihabi (2002) were the first to use this method: they were mainly interested in showing that a removed connective could be recovered from its linguistic context.",
        "In turn, they only tested their approach on examples that were also generated automatically, and not on manually annotated implicit examples.",
        "In this setting, they report an accuracy of 49.7 (6 classes), significantly above luck.",
        "Reusing the same approach, Sporleder and Lascarides (2008) then showed that a system trained on a large amount of artificial examples (72000 examples) performs much worse than the same system trained on a much smaller amount of natural examples (1, 051 examples) implicit examples, with accuracies of 25.8 and 40.3, respectively.",
        "Marcu and Echihabi's (2002) original approach was based on the idea of finding pairs of semantically related words that together trigger a relation (such as ?nocturne/jour?",
        "(?nocturnal/daytime?)",
        "in example 1 of contrast).",
        "Interestingly, Pitler et al. (2009) showed that word pairs extracted from artificial data are not helpful for implicit relation identification and, moreover, that the most informative word pairs are not semantically related.",
        "Blair-Goldensohn et al. (2007) showed that, for cause and contrast at least, results can be enhanced by improving the quality of the artificial data.",
        "Finally, Wang et al. (2012) propose a first approach that exploits both natural and artificial data.",
        "Specifically, they select the most informative training points among natural and artificial examples, both coming from the PDTB or the RST DT.",
        "They define deterministic rules for identifying so-called ?typical?",
        "examples of a relation, the ?seed?",
        "sets that are then expanded using a simple clustering algorithm.",
        "They report performance results well over those of (Pitler et al., 2009), but using a different evaluation protocole.",
        "4 Also, their method is not easy to repoduce, especially for French, where we can not define the same deterministic rules as some of these depend on polarity information, for which we do not have external resources.",
        "Furthermore, their approach only extracts 1 to 5% of the data as seed examples, which would represent too few examples on our corpus.",
        "Finally, we are interested in finer-grained relations, thus more difficult to discriminate using these kind of rules.",
        "3 Proposed Approach Our approach builds upon and extends the method of (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002) and (Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008) by investigating different strategies for combining natural and artificial examples of implicit discourse relations.",
        "These different combination schemes are inspired from domain adaptation and are motivated by the fact that artificial and natural examples follow different probability distributions.",
        "3.1 Distribution Differences Most machine learning algorithms are based on the assumption that data from training and test samples are independently and identically distributed (i.e., the i.i.d.",
        "sampling assumption).",
        "Yet, it seems that the use of artificial data clearly undermines this assumption.",
        "There is indeed no guarantee that our artificial examples should follow a distribution similar to that of the manual examples.",
        "This leads to the problem of learning from non-iid data, a problem that has attracted growing attention these last years in machine learning and NLP (Sogaard, 2013), (Hand, 2006).",
        "In this particular context, we have two sets of data with the same output space (i.e., the discourse relations), and the same kind of inputs space (i.e., spans of text).",
        "But our data samples can differ in a number of ways.",
        "Following the terminology in (Moreno-Torres et al., 2012), we may encounter all the different kinds of shift that can appear in a classification problem.",
        "Prior Probability Shift This shift describes changes in the marginal distribution of the output (i.e., the relations).",
        "The artificial data do not have the same class distribution as the natural ones (see section 4).",
        "Neither do they have the same distribution as the natural explicit, because of the automatic extraction.",
        "This problem can be easily handled by resampling artificial data (see section 4).",
        "4 Wang et al. (2012) only use the first annotated relation and ignore the Entity relation, whereas Pitler et al. (2009) keep all the annotations and map Entity examples to the Expansion class.",
        "1696 Covariate Shift This shift describes changes in the marginal distribution of the input (i.e., the pairs of spans of text).",
        "Artifical examples are originally explicit examples minus their connective, so it is rea-sonnable to think that these examples will have a different distribution from the natural implicit examples.",
        "Moreover, it is possible that, by removing the connective, we have made these examples semantically unfelicitous or even ungrammatical.",
        "Segmentation is another issue, since it is automatic and based on heuristics (see section 4).",
        "For example, artificial examples can not be multi-sentential whereas it can be the case for natural ones.",
        "Concept Shift This shift describes changes in the joint distribution of inputs and outputs.",
        "Consider for instance the occurrences of relations within inter- and intra-sentential contexts.",
        "The proportion of inter-sentential examples in natural and artificial datasets is the same for contrast (57.1%), it is similar for result (resp.",
        "45.7% and 39.8%), but very different for continuation (resp.",
        "70% and 96.5%) and for explanation (resp.",
        "21.4% and 53.0%).",
        "Moreover, the extraction method is prone to errors, and it may be the case that we wrongly identify a word form as a discourse connective.",
        "Thus, we may produce examples annotated with a wrong relation or that do not involve any discourse relation at all.",
        "Finally, deleting a connective can make the discourse ackward or even incoherent (Asher and Lascarides, 2003).",
        "We can actually witness this with example (1).",
        "As shown by (Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008), deleting the connective can also change the inferred relation.",
        "They found examples of explanation in which an implicit relation becomes the only one inferable after removing the explicit marker.The deletion can also change the inferred relation (Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008).",
        "We found an even worse effect in our French corpus.",
        "In example (3), the connective puisqu(e) (because) triggers an explanation, thus the events are ordered following the causal law.",
        "The cause, ?migrer?",
        "(?migrate?",
        "), comes before the effect, ?deviennent?",
        "(?becomes?).",
        "But when we delete the connective, the order of the events seems to be reversed.",
        "Keeping the first clause as the first argument, we then obtain a result relation in this sentence.",
        "(3) Les Amorrites deviennent ?",
        "la p?riode suivante de s?rieux adversaires des souverains d?Ur, puisqu?ils commencent alors ?",
        "migrer en grand nombre vers la M?sopotamie.",
        "In the next period, Amorrites become severe opponents of the sovereigns of Ur, because they then begin to migrate in large numbers to Mesopotamia.",
        "3.2 Methods Inspired by Domain Adaptation A way to deal with all the distribution differences observed is to reframe our problem within the framework of domain adaptation.",
        "Informally, the task of domain adaptation is to port some system from one domain, the source, to another, the target.",
        "Informally, we have a distribution D s for the source data and a distribution D t for the target data.",
        "The goal of the classifier is to build a good approximation of D t .",
        "If one uses data following the distribution D s in order to build this approximation, then the performance will depend of the similarity between D s and D t .",
        "If these distributions are too dissimilar, the approximation will be bad and so will be the performance.",
        "It is the case in particular when the domains (e.g., text genres) are different.",
        "The goal of domain adaptation is precisely to deal with data from different distributions (Jiang, 2008), (Mansour et al., 2009).",
        "We are not exactly in the same setting, but we can regard the artificial data as the source, and the natural data, on which we evaluate, as the target.",
        "As a first step, we decided to investigate the simplest domain adaptation methods there is, such as those described in (Daum?",
        "III, 2007).",
        "These methods either combine directly the data or the models built on each set of data.",
        "Performance of all these systems will be compared to the base systems trained on only one set of data, in section 6.",
        "Data combination The first possibility is to combine the data.",
        "The first model is trained on all natural and artificial data together (UNION).",
        "This method does not allow us to control the importance of the two sets of data nor to evaluate their influence on the system.",
        "We thus refine it in two ways.",
        "First, we only add to the manual data randomly selected samples from the artificial data (ARTSUB).",
        "Alternatively, we keep all the artificial examples but reweight (or, equivalently, duplicate) the manual examples (NATW).",
        "Both these schemes allow us to avoid a massive imbalance between the two kinds of data.",
        "1697 Model combination The second strategy consists in combining the models.",
        "A first set of methods involve adding new features.",
        "That is, we train a model on the artificial data, then run it on the natural examples.",
        "We use these predictions as new attributes for the natural model (ADDPRED).",
        "The parameter associated to the attribute therefore measures the importance to be given to the predictions made by the model trained on artificial data.",
        "We propose a variation of this method by adding the probabilities of each prediction as supplementary attributes (ADDPROB).",
        "The intuition is that even if the classifier is wrong, it could still be consistent in its errors.",
        "Yet another model combination consists in using the parameters of the artificial model as initial values for the manual model parameters (ARTINIT).",
        "This method allows to give an initial information to the natural model rather than a random intialization.",
        "Finally, we also build a model by linearly interpolating the two basic models (LININT).",
        "In addition to these combination schemes, we also add a method to automatically select examples among the artificial set based on the confidence of the artificial model.",
        "Its aim is to filter out noisy examples, our hypothesis being that the more confident the model, the less noisy the example.",
        "4 Data In this work, we choose to focus on 4 relations, contrast, result, continuation and explanation, each of which can be either explicit or implicit.",
        "These are the same as the relations used in (Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008), allowing for easy comparison across languages, with the exception of the relation summary which does not appear in the ANNODIS corpus.",
        "Although it is difficult to map these relations onto the relation set of the PDTB, we can say that our relations are closer to level 2 and level 3 (i.e., fine-grained) PDTB relations than level 1 (i.e., coarse-grained) ones.",
        "4.1 Manually Annotated Data: ANNODIS Our natural implicit examples are taken from the ANNODIS corpus, which is to date the only available French corpus annotated at the discourse level.",
        "Its annotations are based on the SDRT framework (Asher and Lascarides, 2003).",
        "It consists of 86 newspaper and Wikipedia articles.",
        "3, 339 examples have been annotated using 17 relations.",
        "In way of comparison, note that the PDTB has roughly 12 times more annotated relations than ANNODIS.",
        "Documents are segmented in Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) which can be clauses, prepositionnal phrases and some adverbials and parentheticals if the span of text describes an event.",
        "The relations link EDUs and complex segments, adjacent or not.",
        "The connectives are not annotated, which means that the examples of implicit relations had to be extracted automatically.",
        "The corpus has been pre-processed using the MELt tagger (Denis and Sagot, 2009) for POS-tagging, lemmatization and morphological markings.",
        "Then, the documents have been parsed using the the MST-Parser (McDonald and Pereira, 2006) trained for French by (Candito et al., 2010).",
        "In order to identify implicit examples, we used the French lexicon of connectives (LexConn) developed by Roze et al. (2012).",
        "We simply matched all possible connective forms associated with the annotated relations (discarding ?, which is too ambiguous).",
        "We did not add constraints on the connective position, as we wanted to be sure to exclude all explicit examples, this method led us to miss a few implicit examples.",
        "Out of 1, 108 examples annotated with one of the 4 relations considered, 494 were found to be implicit (see table 2).",
        "4.2 Automatically Annotated Data The artificial data are automatically extracted from raw data using heuristic rules.",
        "We use LexConn to mine explicit instances in the corpus Est R?publicain composed of newspaper articles (9M sentences), with the same pre-processings as ANNODIS.",
        "LexConn contains 329 connectives, among them, 131 are unambiguous for our 4 relations.",
        "We grouped pragmatic relations (i.e., the relation is between speech acts) and non pragmatic relations (i.e., the relation is between facts) relations, assuming they involve the same kind of predictors, and the 3 contrastive relations, as only one type of contrast is annotated in ANN-ODIS.",
        "We did not take into account 3 connectives corresponding to unknown part-of-speech.",
        "Our first evaluation led us to delete 6 connectives, very ambiguous between discourse and non discourse readings, such as ?maintenant?",
        "(?now?).",
        "We eventually settled on 122 connectives, among which 100 were seen in the corpus in a configuration matching one of our pre-defined patterns.",
        "As a comparison, (Sporleder 1698 and Lascarides, 2008) only had 50 such connectives.",
        "We finally use 122 connectives, among which 100 were seen in a correct configuration in the corpus.",

        "For the other relations, a large weight on the artificial data clearly decreases the F 1 score.",
        "However, the identification of explanation is improved when we add the predictions of the artificial model (at best, ADDPRED+SELEC, 53.9 F 1 score).",
        "Improvement is fairly low for result (at best, 51.0 with ADDPRED+SELEC).",

        "For explanation, predictions of the artificial model could be quiet coherent as most of the artificial examples correspond to the pragmatic relation explanation ?",
        ".",
        "Moreover, if we look at the feature distribution (850 features overall), we observe a gap of more than 30% for 2 and 5 features for result and explanation that is not observed for contrast and continuation, the relations that make the most of the artificial data.",
        "7 Conclusion We have presented the first system that identifies implicit discourse relations for French.",
        "This kind of relation is difficult to identify because of the lack of specific predictors.",
        "In the previous studies on English, the performance on this task are fairly low despite the use of complex features, probably because of a lack of manually annotated data.",
        "To deal with this issue, even more crucial for French, our system also resorts to additional data, automatically annotated using discourse connectives.",

        "We add an automatic selection of examples among the artificial data to deal with noise generated by the method of automatic annotation.",
        "We manage to get significant improvement over a system solely trained using available data manually annotated by using automatic selection and the addition of features corresponding to the predictions of the artificial model.",
        "In future work, we will explore more sophisticated methods to deal with data samples that follow different distributions.",
        "We will also explore ways to deal with imbalanced data and use our methods on all the relations annotated in our French corpus.",
        "Finally, we will test these methods on English corpora, in order to compare their efficiency with previous studies.",
