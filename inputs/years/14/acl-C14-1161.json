        "With the basic technology supporting dialogue systems maturing, there has been more interest in recent years about dialogue systems that move beyond the traditional task-based or chatter bot frameworks.",
        "In particular there has been increasing interest in dialogue systems that engage in persuasion or negotiation (Georgila and Traum, 2011; Georgila, 2013; Paruchuri et al., 2009; Heeman, 2009; Mazzotta and de Rosis, 2006; Mazzotta et al., 2007; Nguyen et al., 2007; Guerini et al., 2003).",
        "We concern ourselves with cooperative persuasive dialogue systems (Hiraoka et al., 2013), which try to satisfy both the user and system goals.",
        "For these types of systems, creating a system policy that both has persuasive power and is able to ensure that the user is satisfied is the key to the system's success.",
        "In recent years, reinforcement learning has gained much attention in the dialogue research community as an approach for automatically learning optimal dialogue policies.",
        "The most popular framework for reinforcement learning in dialogue models is based on Markov decision processes (MDP) and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP).",
        "In these frameworks, the system gets a reward representing the degree of success of the dialogue.",
        "Reinforcement learning enables the system to learn a policy maximizing the reward.",
        "Traditional reinforcement learning requires thousands of dialogues, which are difficult to collect with real users.",
        "Therefore, a user simulator which simulates the behavior of real users is used for generating training dialogues.",
        "Most research in reinforcement learning for dialogue system policies has been done in slot-filling dialogue, where the system elicits information required to provide appropriate services for the user (Levin et al., 2000; Williams and Young, 2007).",
        "There is also ongoing research on applying reinforcement learning to persuasion and negotiation dialogues, which are different from slot-filling dialogue (Georgila and Traum, 2011; Georgila, 2013; Paruchuri et al., 2009; Heeman, 2009).",
        "In slot-filling dialogue, the system is required to perform the dialogue to achieve the user goal, eliciting some information from a user to provide an appropriate service.",
        "A reward corresponding to the achievement of the user's goal is given to the system.",
        "In contrast, in persuasive dialogue, the system convinces the user to take some action achieving the system goal.",
        "Thus, in this setting, reward corresponding to the achievement of both the user's and the system's goal is given to the system.",
        "The importance of each goal will vary depending on the use case of the system.",
        "For ",
        "1706 example, a selfish system could be rewarded with an emphasis on only achievement of the system goal, and a cooperative system could be rewarded with an emphasis on achievement of both of the goals.",
        "In addition, negotiation dialogue could be considered as a kind of the persuasive dialogue where the user also tries to convince the system to achieve the user's goal.",
        "In this paper, our research purpose is learning better policies for cooperative persuasive dialogue systems using framing.",
        "We focus on learning a policy that tries to satisfy both the user and system goals.",
        "In particular, two elements in this work set it apart from previous works: ?",
        "We introduce framing (Irwin et al., 2013), which is known to be important for persuasion and a key concept of this paper, as a system action.",
        "Framing uses emotionally charged words to explain particular alternatives.",
        "In the context of research that applies reinforcement learning to persuasive (or negotiation) dialogue, this is the first work that considers framing as a system action.",
        "?",
        "We use a human-to-human persuasive dialogue corpus of Hiraoka et al. (2014) to train predictive models for achievement of a human persuadee's and a human persuader's goals, and introduce these models to reward calculation to enable the system to learn a policy reflecting knowledge of human persuasion.",
        "To achieve our research purpose, we construct a POMDP where the reward function and user simulator are learned from a corpus of human persuasive dialogue.",
        "We define system actions based on framing and general dialogue acts.",
        "In addition, the system dialogue state (namely, belief state) is defined for tracking the system's rewards.",
        "Then, we evaluate the effect of framing and learning a system policy.",
        "Experimental evaluation is done through a user simulator and real users.",
        "2 Reinforcement learning Reinforcement learning is a machine learning technique for learning a system policy.",
        "The policy is a mapping function from a dialogue state to a particular system action.",
        "In reinforcement learning, the policy is learned by maximizing the reward function.",
        "Reinforcement learning is often applied to models based on the framework of MDP or POMDP.",
        "In this paper, we follow a POMDP-based approach.",
        "A POMDP is defined as a tuple ?S,A, P,R,O,Z, ?, b 0 ?",
        "where S is the set of states (representing different contexts) which the system may be in (the system's world), A is the set of actions of the system, P : S ?A ?",
        "P (S,A) is the set of transition probabilities between states after taking an action, R : S?A ?",
        "?",
        "is the reward function, O is a set of observations that the system can receive about the world, Z is a set of observation probabilities Z : S ?",
        "A ?",
        "Z(S,A), and ?",
        "a discount factor weighting longterm rewards.",
        "At any given time step i the world is in some unobserved state s i ?",
        "S. Because s i is not known exactly, we keep a distribution over states called a belief state b, thus b(s i ) is the probability of being in state s i , with initial belief state b 0 .",
        "When the system performs an action ?",
        "i ?",
        "A based on b, following a policy pi : S ?",
        "A, it receives a reward r i (s i , ?",
        "i ) ?",
        "?",
        "and transitions to state s i+1 according to P (s i+1 |s i , ?",
        "i ) ?",
        "P .",
        "The system then receives an observation o i+1 according to P (o i+1 |s i+1 , ?",
        "i ).",
        "The quality of the policy pi followed by the agent is measured by the expected future reward also called Q-function, Q pi : S ?A ?",
        "?.",
        "In this framework, it is critical to be able to learn a good policy function.",
        "In order to do so, we use Neural fitted Q Iteration (Riedmiller, 2005) for learning the system policy.",
        "Neural fitted Q Iteration is an offline value-based method, and optimizes the parameters to approximate the Q-function.",
        "Neural fitted Q Iteration repeatedly performs 1) sampling training experience using a POMDP through interaction and 2) training a Q-function approximator using training experience.",
        "Neural fitted Q Iteration uses a multi-layered perceptron as the Q-function approximator.",
        "Thus, even if the Q-function is complex, Neural fitted Q Iteration can approximate the Q-function better than using a linear approximation function 1 .",
        "3 Persuasive dialogue corpus In this section, we give a brief overview of Hiraoka et al. (2014)'s persuasive dialogue corpus between human participants that we will use to estimate the models described in later sections.",
        "1 In a preliminary experiment, we found that Neural fitted Q Iteration had high performance compared to using the linear approximation of the Q-function in this domain.",

        "3.1 Outline of persuasive dialogue corpus As a typical example of persuasive dialogue, the corpus consists of dialogues between a salesperson (persuader) and customer (persuadee).",
        "The salesperson attempts to convince the customer to purchase a particular product (decision) from a number of alternatives (decision candidates).",
        "This type of dialogue is defined as ?sales dialogue.?",
        "More concretely, the corpus assumes a situation where the customer is in an appliance store looking for a camera, and the customer must decide which camera to purchase from 5 alternatives.",
        "Prior to recording, the salesperson is given the description of the 5 cameras and instructed to try to convince the customer to purchase a specific camera (the persuasive target).",
        "In this corpus, the persuasive target is camera A, and this persuasive target is invariant over all subjects.",
        "The customer is also instructed to select one preferred camera from the catalog of the cameras, and choose one aspect of the camera that is particularly important in making their decision (the determinant).",
        "During recording, the customer and the salesperson converse and refer to the information in the camera catalog as support for their dialogues.",
        "The customer can close the dialogue whenever they want, and choose to buy a camera, not buy a camera, or reserve their decision for a later date.",
        "The corpus includes a role-playing dialogue with participants consisting of 3 salespeople from 30 to 40 years of age and 19 customers from 20 to 40 years of age.",
        "All salespeople have experience working in an appliance store.",
        "The total number of dialogues is 34, and the total time is about 340 minutes.",
        "Table 1 show an example transcript of the beginning of one dialogue.",
        "Further examples are shown in Table 8 in the appendix.",
        "3.2 Annotated dialogue acts Each utterance is annotated with two varieties of tags, the first covering dialogue acts in general, and the rest covering framing.",
        "As a tag set to represent traditional dialogue acts, we use the general-purpose functions (GPF) defined by the ISO international standard for dialogue act annotation (ISO24617-2, 2010).",
        "All annotated GPF tags are defined to be one of the tags in this set (Table 2).",
        "More relevant to this work is the framing annotation.",
        "Framing uses emotionally charged words to explain particular alternatives.",
        "It has been suggested that humans generally evaluate decision candidates by selecting based on several determinants weighted by the user's preference, and that framing is an effective way of increasing persuasive power.",
        "This corpus focuses on negative/positive framing (Irwin et al., 2013; Mazzotta and de Rosis, 2006), with negative framing using negative words and positive framing using positive words.",
        "In the corpus, framing is defined as a tuple ?a, p, r?",
        "where a represents the target alternative, p takes value NEG if the framing is negative, and POS if the framing is positive, and r represents whether the framings contains a reference to the persuadees preferred determinant (for example, the performance or price of a camera), taking the value TRUE if contained, and FALSE if not contained.",
        "The user's preferred determinant is annotated based on the results of a questionnaire.",
        "Table 3 shows an example of positive framing (p=POS) about the performance of Camera A (a=A).",
        "In this example, the customer answered that his preference is the price of camera, and this utterance does 1708 Figure 1: Dynamic Bayesian network of the user simulator.",
        "Each node represents a variable, and each edge represents a probabilistic dependency.",
        "The system cannot observe the shaded variables.",
        "not contain any description of price.",
        "Thus, r=NO is annotated.",
        "Further examples of positive and negative framing are shown in Tables 9 and 10 in the appendix.",
        "In this paper, we re-perform annotation of the framing tags and evaluate inter-annotator agreement, which is slightly improved from Hiraoka et al. (2014).",
        "Two annotators are given the description and examples of tags (e.g. what a positive word is), and practice with these manuscripts prior to annotation.",
        "In corpus annotation, at first, each annotator independently chooses the framing sentences.",
        "Then, framing tags are independently annotated to all utterances chosen by the two annotators.",
        "The inter-annotator agreement of framing polarity is 96.9% (kappa=0.903).",
        "4 User simulator In this section, we describe a statistical dialogue model for the user (customer in Section 3).",
        "This model is used to simulate the system's conversational partner in applying reinforcement learning.",
        "The user simulator estimates two aspects of the conversation: 1.",
        "The user's general dialogue act.",
        "2.",
        "Whether the preferred determinant has been conveyed to the user (conveyed preferred determinant; CPD).",
        "The users?",
        "general dialogue act is represented by using GPF.",
        "For example, in Table 1, PROPQ, ANSWER, and INFORM appear as the user's dialogue act.",
        "In our research, the user simulator chooses one GPF described in Table 2 or None representing no response at each turn.",
        "CPD represents that the user has been convinced that the determinant in the persuader's framing satisfies the user's preference.",
        "For example, in Table 3, the ?performance?",
        "is contained in the clerk's positive framing for camera A.",
        "If the persuadee is convinced that the decision candidate satisfies his/her preference based on this framing, we say that CPD has occurred (r=YES) 2 .",
        "In our research, the user simulator models CPD for each of the 5 cameras.",
        "This information is required to calculate reward described in the following Section 5.1.",
        "Specifically, GPF and CPD are used for calculating naturalness and persuasion success, which are part of the reward function.",
        "The user simulator is based on an order one Markov chain, and Figure 1 shows its dynamic Bayesian network.",
        "The user's GPF G t+1 user and CPD C t+1 alt at turn t + 1 are calculated by the following equations.",
        "P (G t+1 user |G t user , F t sys , G t sys , S alt ) (1) P (C t+1 alt |C t alt , F t sys , G t sys , S alt ) (2) G t sys represents the system GPF at time t. F t sys represents the system framing at t. These two variables correspond to system actions, and are explained in Section 5.2.",
        "G t user represents the user's GPF at t. C t alt represents the CPD at t. S alt represents the users's original evaluation of the alternatives.",
        "In our 2 Note that the persuader does not necessarily know if r=YES because the persuader is not certain of the user's preferred determinants.",
        "1709 research, this is the camera that the user selected as a preferred camera at the beginning of the dialogue 3 .",
        "We use the persuasive dialogue corpus described in Section 3 for training the user simulator, considering the customer in the corpus as the user and the salesperson in the corpus as the system.",
        "In addition, we use logistic regression for learning Equations (1) and (2).",
        "5 Learning cooperative persuasion policies Now that we have introduced the user model, we describe the system's dialogue management.",
        "In par-ticular, we describe the reward, system action, and belief state, which are required for reinforcement learning.",
        "5.1 Reward We follow Hiraoka et al. (2014) in defining a reward function according to three factors: user satisfac-tion, system persuasion success, and naturalness.",
        "As described in Section 1, we focus on developing cooperative persuasive dialogue systems.",
        "Therefore, the system must perform dialogue to achieve both the system and user goals.",
        "In our research, we define three elements of the reward function as follows: Satisfaction The user's goal is represented by subjective user satisfaction.",
        "The reason why we use satisfaction is that the user's goal is not necessarily clear for the system (and system creator) in persuasive dialogue.",
        "For example, some users may want the system to recommend appropriate alternatives, while some users may want the system not to recommend, but only give information upon the user's request.",
        "As the goal is different for each user, we use abstract satisfaction as a measure, and leave it to each user how to evaluate achievement of the goal.",
        "Persuasive success The system goal is represented by persuasion success.",
        "Persuasion success represents whether the persuadee finally chooses the persuasive target (in this paper, camera A) at the end of the dialogue.",
        "Persuasion success takes the value SUCCESS when the customer decides to purchase the persuasive target at the end of dialogue, and FAILURE otherwise.",
        "Naturalness In addition, we use naturalness as one of the rewards.",
        "This factor is known to enhance the learned policy performance for real users (Meguro et al., 2011).",
        "The reward at each turn t is calculated with the following equation 4 .",
        "r t = (Sat t user + PS t sys + N t )/3 (3) Sat t user represents a 5 level score of the user's subjective satisfaction (1: Not satisfied?3: Neutral?",
        "5: Satisfied) at turn t scaled into the range between 0 and 1.",
        "PS t sys represents persuasion success (1: SUCCESS?0: FAILURE) at turn t. N t represents bi-gram likelihood of the dialogue between system and user at turn t as follows.",
        "N t = P (F t sys , G t sys , G t user |F t?1 sys , G t?1 sys , G t?1 user ) (4) In our research, Sat and PS are calculated with a predictive model constructed from the human persuasion dialogue corpus described in Section 3.",
        "In constructing these predictive models, the persuasion results (i.e. persuasion success and persuadee's satisfaction) at the end of dialogue are given as the supervisory signal, and the dialogue features in Table 4 are given as the input.",
        "In the reward calculation, the dialogue features used by the predictive model are calculated by information generated from the dialogue of the user simulator and the system.",
        "Table 4 shows all features used for reward calculation at each turn 5 .",
        "Note that, for the calculating TOTAL TIME, average speaking time corresponding to speakers and dialogue acts is added at each turn.",
        "3 Preliminary experiments indicated that the user behaved differently depending on the first selection of the camera, thus we introduce this variable to the user simulator.",
        "4 We also optimized the policy in the case where the reward (Equation (3)) is given only when dialogue is closed.",
        "However, the convergence of the learning was much longer, and the performance was relatively bad.",
        "5 Originally, there are more dialogue features for the predictive model.",
        "However as in previous research, we choose significant dialogue features by step-wise feature selection (Terrell and Bilge, 2012).",
        "1710 Table 4: Features for calculating reward.",
        "These features are also used as the system belief state.",

        "is a framing/GPF pair.",
        "These pairs represent the dialogue act of the salesperson, and are required for reward calculation (Section 5.1).",
        "There are 11 types of framing (Table 5), and 9 types of GPF which are expanded by adding RELEASETURN and CLOSEDIALOGUE to the original GPF sets (Table 2).",
        "The number of all possible GPF/framing pairs is 99, and some pairs have not appeared in the original corpus.",
        "Therefore, we reduce the number of actions by filtering.",
        "We construct a unigram model of the salesperson's dialogue acts P (F sales , G sales ) from the original corpus, then exclude pairs for which the likelihood is below 0.005 6 .",
        "As a result, the 13 pairs shown in Table 6 remained 7 .",
        "We use these pairs as the system actions.",
        "5.3 Belief state The current system belief state is represented by the features used for reward calculation (Table 4) and the reward calculated at previous turn.",
        "Namely, the features for the reward calculation and calculated reward are also used as the next input of the system policy.",
        "Note that the system cannot directly observe C alt , thus the system estimates it through the dialogue by using the following equation.",
        "P ( ?",
        "C t+1 alt | ?",
        "C t alt , F t sys , G t sys , S alt ) (5) where ?",
        "C t+1 alt represents the estimated CPD at t + 1. ?",
        "C t alt represents the estimated CPD at t. The other variables are the same as those in Equation (2).",
        "In contrast, we assume that the system can observe G user and S alt .",
        "G user is not usually observable because traditional dialogue systems have automatic speech recognition/Spoken language understanding errors.",
        "However, in this work, we use Wizard of Oz in place of automatic speech recognition/Spoken language understanding (Section 6.2).",
        "Thus, we can ignore these factors 8 .",
        "6 Experimental evaluation In this section, we describe the evaluation of the proposed method for learning cooperative persuasive dialogue policies.",
        "Especially, we focus on examining how the learned policy with framing is effective for persuasive dialogue.",
        "The evaluation is done both using a user simulator and real users.",
        "6 We chose this threshold by trying values from 0.001 to 0.01 with incrementation of 0.001.",
        "We select the threshold that resulted in the number of actions closest to previous work (Georgila, 2013).",
        "7 Cameras C and D are not popular, and don't appear frequently in the human persuasive dialogue corpus, and are therefore excluded in filtering.",
        "8 In addition to this reason, the G user is not so essential to our research (GPF is general dialogue act), and we want to focus the CPD.",
        "This is the other reason that we assume that G user is observable.",
        "1711 Figure 2: Average reward of each system.",
        "Error bars represents 95% confidence intervals.",
        "Rew represents the reward, Sat represents the user satisfaction, PS represents persuasion success, and Nat represents naturalness.",
        "6.1 Policy learning and evaluation using the user simulator For evaluating the effectiveness of framing and learning the policy through the user simulator, we prepare the following 3 policies.",
        "Random A baseline where the action is randomly output from all possible actions.",
        "NoFraming A baseline where the action is output based on the policy which is learned using only GPFs.",
        "For constructing the actions, we remove actions whose framing is not None from the actions described in Section 5.2.",
        "The policy is a greedy policy, and selects the action with the highest Q-value.",
        "Framing The proposed method where the action is output based on the policy learned with all actions described in Section 5.2 including framing.",
        "The policy is also a greedy policy.",
        "For learning the policy, we use Neural fitted Q Iteration (Section 2).",
        "For applying Neural fitted Q Iteration, we use the Pybrain library (Schaul et al., 2010).",
        "We set the discount factor ?",
        "of learning to 0.9, and the number of nodes in the hidden layer of the neural network for approximating the Q-function to the sum of number of belief states and actions (i.e. Framing: 53, NoFraming: 47).",
        "The policy in learning is the ?-greedy policy (?",
        "= 0.3).",
        "These conditions follow the default Pybrain settings.",
        "We consider 50 dialogues as one epoch, and update the parameters of the neural network at each epoch.",
        "Learning is finished when number of epochs reaches 200 (10000 dialogues), and the policy with the highest average reward is used for evaluation.",
        "We evaluate the system on the basis of average reward per dialogue with the user simulator.",
        "For calculating average reward, 1000 dialogues are performed with each policy.",
        "Experimental results (Figure 2) indicate that 1) performance is greatly improved by learning and 2) framing is somewhat effective for the user simulator.",
        "Learned policies (Framing, NoFraming) get a higher reward than Random.",
        "Particularly, both of the learned policies better achieve user satisfaction than Random.",
        "On the other hand, only Framing is able to achieve better persuasion success than Random.",
        "This result indicates that framing is effective for persuasive success.",
