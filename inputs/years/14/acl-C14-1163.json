        "Morphological processing forms the first step of virtually all linguistic processing toolchains in natural language processing (NLP) and precedes other analyses such as part of speech tagging, parsing, or named entity recognition.",
        "There are three major types of morphological processes: (a) Inflection modifies word forms according to the grammatical context; (b) derivation constructs new words from individual existing words, typically through affixation; (c) composition combines multiple words into new lexical items.",
        "Computational treatment of morphology is often restricted to normalization, such as lemmatization (covering inflection only) or stemming (covering inflection and derivation heuristically, Porter (1980)).",
        "An important reason is that English is morphologically a relatively simple language.",
        "Composition is not marked morphologically (zoo gate) and an important derivational pattern is zero derivation where the input and output terms are identical surface forms (a fish / to fish).",
        "Thus, lemmatization or stemming go a long way towards treating the aspects of English morphology relevant for NLP.",
        "The situation is different for languages with a complex morphology that calls for explicit treatment.",
        "In fact, recent years have seen a growing body of computational work in particular on derivation, which is a very productive process of word formation in Slavic languages but also in languages more closely related to English, like German ( ?",
        "Stekauer and Lieber, 2005).",
        "Derivation comprises a large number of distinct patterns, many of which cross part of speech boundaries (nominalization, verbalization, adjectivization), but some of which do not (gender indicators like master / mistress, approximations like red / reddish).",
        "A simple way to conceptualize derivation is that it partitions a language's vocabulary into derivational families of derivationally related lemmas (cf. Zeller et al. (2013), Gaussier (1999)).",

        "Another source of derivational information are stand-alone derivational lexicons such as CatVar (Habash and Dorr, 2003) for English, DERIVBASE (Zeller et al., 2013) for German, or the multilingual CELEX (Baayen et al., 1996).",
        "Recent work has demonstrated that NLP can benefit from derivational knowledge.",

        "Luong et al. (2013) and Lazaridou et al. (2013) improve distributional semantic representations.",
        "Note that all of these applications make use of derivational knowledge to address various semantic tasks, working on the assumption that derivationally related words, as represented in derivational lexicons, are strongly semantically related.",
        "This assumption is not completely warranted, though.",
        "The development of wide-coverage derivational lexicons is generally driven by morphological information, using for example finite-state technology (Karttunen and Beesley, 2005) to characterize known derivational patterns in terms of string transformations.",
        "Even though there is a strong correlation in derivation between morphology and semantics, it is not perfect.",
        "The absence of (synchronic) semantic relatedness can have a number of reasons, including accidental instantiation of derivational patterns (corn ?",
        "corner) and diachronic meaning drift (dog (animal) ?",
        "dogged (determined)).",
        "In other words, a substantial number of the lemma pairs in those lexicons are false positives regarding the level of semantic relatedness.",
        "Our goal in this paper is to ameliorate this situation by developing strategies for the semantic validation of derivational lexicons, i.e., methods to determine, for lemma pairs that are derivationally related at the morphological level, whether they are in fact semantically related.",
        "We base our study on the German derivational lexicon DERIVBASE, and start by assessing which strategies can be used for its semantic validation (Section 2).",
        "In Sections 3 and 4, we analyze the contributions of semantic information (distributional semantics) as well as structural information (derivational rules).",
        "On the basis of our observations, we train a classifier that is able to semantically validate DERIVBASE at 89.9% F 1 -score (Section 5), significantly outperforming a majority-class baseline of 84.1%.",

        "Figure 1 shows a small sample from a derivational family with three lemmas and two derivational rules, one turning a verb into the corresponding event noun (in this case a semelfactive), and one turning the event into an adjective associated with it.",

        "We will assume the latter perspective in this paper, leaving questions of global coherence for future work.",
        "DERIVBASE is a good example for the problems sketched in Section 1.",
        "It is defined purely on morphological grounds, without semantic validation of derivational families.",
        "Consequently, it contains a substantial number of words that are not semantically related.",
        "2.2 Morphological and Semantic Relatedness in DERIVBASE Our original evaluation of the quality of DERIVBASE in Zeller et al. (2013) was based on manually classified samples of lemma pairs.",
        "We introduce two samples, the ?R sample?, drawn from a large population of lemma pairs with high string similarity, in order to calculate recall, and the ?P sample?, drawn from the DERIVBASE families, in order to compute precision.",
        "Each lemma pair was classified into one of five categories (R: morphologically and semantically related; M: only morphologically related; N: not related; L: lemmatization errors; C: compounds) and inter-annotator agreement was checked to be substantial.",
        "2 The overall best model (L123) showed 83% precision and 71% recall.",
        "However, this evaluation is limited in two important respects.",
        "First, it refers to DERIVBASE release 1.2 from 2013.",
        "Since then, we have extended DERIVBASE, e.g., with rules covering particle verbs, a very productive area of German derivation.",
        "Secondly, and more seriously, the previous evaluation considered all instances of R and M as true positives.",
        "In other words, in Zeller et al. (2013) we only evaluated the morphological relatedness of the lemma pairs but not the semantic relatedness.",
        "We therefore start by presenting an evaluation of DERIVBASE focusing on the R instances in Table 1, reusing the DERIVBASE 1.2 ?P?",
        "and ?R?",
        "samples introduced in Zeller et al. (2013, see there for evaluation details).",
        "Between DERIVBASE 1.2 and 1.4, precision increased marginally and recall substantially, due mainly to the inclusion of rules that cover particle verbs.",
        "However, the numbers change substantially when only R (truly semantically related pairs) are counted as true positives.",
        "Recall increases by about 2.5%, but precision drops about 8.5%.",
        "Almost one quarter of all pairs in the lexicon are not semantically related.",
        "A possible confounder of this analysis is that the ?P sample?",
        "was drawn on DERIVBASE 1.2 and therefore does not include the novel items in DERIVBASE 1.4.",
        "We therefore created a novel DERIVBASE 1.4 extended sample by combining the existing ?P sample?",
        "with those pairs from the ?R sample?",
        "that are in the coverage of a DERIVBASE rule as of DERIVBASE 1.4, resulting in 2,545 lemma pairs.",
        "This DERIVBASE 1.4 extended sample will form the basis of all our analyses in this paper.",
        "The class distribution in the new sample is similar, but not identical, to the old P sample, as shown in Table 2.",
        "The relative frequency of R drops another 2%.",
        "Since this number also corresponds to the precision of the resource, the precision of the extended sample is 74.6%.",
        "There are almost no compound errors C, which is not surprising given the rule-based construction of the lexicon, and only a relatively small number (about 5%) of lemmatization errors L, which fall outside the scope of our work.",
        "In contrast, both N and M occur with substantial frequency: Each class accounts for around 10% of the pairs.",
        "An analysis of N shows many cases of rule overgeneration: These are often pairs of lemmas whose stems are sufficiently similar that they might be related, e.g., by stem-changing derivation rules.",
        "Although such rules are valid in other contexts (Verkauf N ?",
        "Verk?aufer N (selling ?",
        "seller)), 2 Although we believe semantic relatedness to be fundamentally a graded scale, we adopt a binary notion of it as a convenient operational simplification that is supported by the good inter-annotator agreement for manual labeling in DERIVBASE.",

        "unruhig A (to rest on ?",
        "restless), both related to Ruhe N (rest).",
        "In other cases, one of the two lemmas appears to have undergone a meaning shift (Rappel N ?",

        "to rattle)).",
        "This is particularly prominent for particle verbs (bauen V ?",
        "erbaulich A (build ?",
        "edifying)).",
        "We divide the DERIVBASE 1.4 extended sample into a development and a test partition (70:30 ratio); the subsequent analyses consider only the development set.",
        "2.3 Hypotheses for Semantic Validation The preceding analysis of DERIVBASE has established that the lexicon contains a substantial number (around one fourth) of lemma pairs that are not semantically related.",
        "Therefore, it is in need of semantic validation, i.e., a computational procedure that can filter out semantically unrelated words.",
        "In this paper, we frame semantic validation as a binary classification task that classifies all lemma pairs within one derivational family as either semantically related or unrelated.",
        "We consider this a first step towards splitting the current, morphologically motivated, DERIVBASE families into smaller, semantically coherent, families.",
        "We base our work on two general hypotheses about the types of information that might be helpful in this endeavor.",
        "Hypothesis 1.",
        "Distributional similarity indicates semantic relatedness between derivationally related words.",
        "The instances of polysemy and meaning shift that we observe, in particular in the M class, motivate the use of distributional similarity (Turney and Pantel, 2010) since we expect these lemma pairs to be distributionally less related than cases of true semantic relatedness.",
        "Hypothesis 2.",
        "Derivational rules differ in their reliability.",
        "Both the evidence from M and N indicate that some rules are more meaning-preserving than others.",
        "We expect this to be tied to both lexical properties of the rules (particle verbs are more likely than diminutives to radically change meaning) as well as structural properties (more specific rules are presumably more precise than generic rules).",
        "In the two following Sections, we will operationalize these hypotheses and analyze the development set of the DERIVBASE 1.4 extended sample with respect to their empirical adequacy.",
        "3 Analysis 1: Distributional Similarity for Semantic Validation 3.1 Measuring Distributional Similarity We examine semantic similarities as predicted by simple bag-of-words semantic space models built from the lemmatized SDeWaC (Faa?",
        "et al., 2010), a large German web corpus containing about 880 million words.",
        "We compute vectors for all words covered in DERIVBASE using a window of ?5 words within sentence boundaries and considering the 10k most frequent lemma-part of speech combinations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives in SDeWaC as contexts.",
        "Distributional vectors are built from co-occurrences which are measured with Local Mutual Information (Evert, 2005).",
        "The semantic similarity is measured by the cosine similarity between the vectors.",
        "Despite the size of the corpus, many lemmas from DERIVBASE occur very infrequently, and due to the inflection in German, it is important to retrieve as many occurrences of each lemma as possible.",
        "1731 We therefore use a very permissive two-step lemmatization scheme that starts from lemmas from the lexicon-based TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994), which provides reliable lemmas but with relatively low coverage, and supplements them with lemmas and parts of speech produced by the probabilistic MATE toolkit (Bohnet, 2010) when TreeTagger abstains.",
        "3.2 Frequency Considerations The advantage of the string transformation-based construction of DERIVBASE is its ability to include infrequent lemmas in the lexicon, and in fact DERIVBASE includes more than 250,000 content lemmas, some of which occur not more than three times in SDeWaC.",
        "However, this is a potential problem when we build distributional representations for all lemmas in DERIVBASE since it is known from the literature that similarity predictions for infrequent lemmas are often unreliable (Bullinaria and Levy, 2007).",
        "Our data conform to expectations in this regard ?",
        "infrequent lemmas are indeed problematic for validating the semantic relatedness of lemma pairs.",
        "More specifically, the semantic similarity of related lemmas (R) is systematically underestimated, because the lemma pairs from our sample are often too infrequent to share any dimensions.",
        "Consequently, they receive a low or zero cosine even when they are semantically strongly related.",
        "For example, each of the lemmas Drogenverkauf N ?",
        "Drogenverk?aufer N (drug selling ?",
        "drug seller) has only nine lemmas as dimensions, and those are completely disjoint.",
        "This underestimation constitutes a general trend.",
        "The model assigns cosine scores below 0.1 to 64% of the related pairs in the development set, cosines below 0.2 to 81%, and cosines below 0.3 to 87%.",
        "Such low scores are problematic for separating related from unrelated pairs.",
        "Two-step lemmatization is important for the proper handling of infrequent words.",
        "Compared to just using TreeTagger, the TreeTagger+MATE vectors for auferstehen V ?",
        "auferstehend A (to resurrect ?",
        "resurrecting) share seven more dimensions, including Jesus, Lord, myth, and suffering.",
        "Correspondingly, the cosine value of this pair rises by 50%.",
        "Generally, the amount of zero cosines in the DERIVBASE 1.4 extended sample drops by 45% using two-step lemmatization compared to one-step TreeTagger lemmatization.",
        "3.3 Conceptual Considerations In addition to the frequency considerations discussed above, we find three conceptual phenomena that affect distributional similarity independently of the frequency aspects.",
        "The first one is the influence of parts of speech.",
        "Derivational rules often change the part of speech of the input lemma, and the parts of speech of its context words change as well.",
        "This decreases context overlap.",
        "For example, ?",
        "Ubersch?atzung N ?",
        "?ubersch?atzt A (overestimate ?",
        "overestimated) is assigned a cosine of merely 0.09.",
        "The upper half of Table 3 shows the top ten individual and shared context words for this pair, ranked by LMI.",
        "The context words of the noun are mainly nominal heads of genitive complements (overestimation of possibility/force/.",
        ".",
        ".",
        "), while the context words of the adjective comprise many adverbs (totally, widely, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ").",
        "None of the shared contexts rank among of the top ten for both target lemmas.",
        "This is even more surprising considering that German adjectives and adverbs have the same surface realization (as opposed to English) and are more likely to form matching context words.",
        "The second phenomenon that we identified as influencing semantic similarity is markedness (Battistella, 1996).",
        "A considerable number of derivational rules systematically produce marked terms.",
        "A striking example is the feminine suffix ?-in?",
        "as in Entertainer N ?",
        "Entertainerin N : Although the lemmas are intuitively very similar, their cosine is as low as 0.1.",
        "The reason is that the female versions tend to be used in contexts where the gender of the entertainer is relevant.",
        "This is illustrated in the lower half of Table 3.",
        "The first two contexts for both words (actor, singer) stem from frequent enumerations (actor and entertainer X) and are almost identical, but again the female versions are marked for gender.",
        "We also find two female given names.",
        "As a result, the target lemmas receive a low distributional similarity.",
        "The third example are cases of mild meaning shifts that were tagged by the annotators as R. These are lemmas where the semantic relatedness is intuitively clearly recognizable but may be accompanied by pretty substantial changes in the distribution of contexts.",
        "Consider the semantically related pair Absteiger N ?",
        "absteigend A (descender (person) ?",
        "descending/decreasing).",

        "3.4 Ranking of Distributional Information Given the results reported above, the standard distributional approach of using plain cosine scores to measure the absolute amount of co-occurrences does not seem very promising, due to the low absolute numbers of shared dimensions of the two lemmas.",
        "We expect other similarity measures, e.g., the Lin measure (Lin, 1998), to perform equally poorly since they do not change the fundamental approach.",
        "Also, although using a large corpus for semantic space construction might ameliorate the situation, we would prefer to make improvements on the modeling side of semantic validation.",
        "We follow the ideas of Hare et al. (2009) and Lapesa and Evert (2013) who propose to consider semantic similarity in terms of ranks rather than absolute values.",

        "Our intuition is that some rules are ?semantically stable?, meaning that they reliably connect semantically similar lemmas, while other rules tend to cause semantic drifts.",
        "To examine 1733 this situation, we perform a qualitative analysis on all lemma pairs connected by rule paths of length one (?simplex paths?",

        "For example, Objektiv N ?",
        "Objektivismus N (lens ?",
        "objectivism), is an N pair for the suffix ?-ismus?.",
        "Finally, zero derivations and very short suffixes are less reliable: Since they easily match, they are often applied to incorrectly lemmatized words (L).",
        "For example, the ?-n?",
        "suffix, which relates nationalities with countries (Schwede N ?",
        "Schweden N (Swede ?",

        "pork cutlets dat/acc-pl ).",
        "This suggests that rule-specific reliability is a promising feature for semantic validation.",
        "Fortunately, due to its construction, DERIVBASE provides a rule chain for each lemma pair so that these reliabilities can be ?read off?.",
        "For other rules, however, the variance of the individual lemma pairs that instantiate the rule is large, and the applicability of the rule is influenced by the particular combination of rule and lemma pair.",

        "However, the input to such studies is almost always a set of words from the same part of speech with no prior morphological constraints, while our input lemmas are morphologically preselected (via derivational rules), are often extremely infrequent, and exhibit systematical variation in parts of speech.",
