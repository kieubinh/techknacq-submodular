        "Abstract",
        "In the context of Social Media Analytics, Natural Language Processing tools face new challenges on on-line conversational text, such as microblogs, chat, or text messages, because of the specificity of the language used in these channels.",
        "This work addresses the problem of Part-Of-Speech tagging (initially for French but also for English) on noisy language usage from the popular social media services like Twitter, Facebook and forums.",
        "We employ a linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) model, enriched with several morphological, orthographic, lexical and large-scale word clustering features.",
        "Our experiments used different feature configurations to train the model.",
        "We achieved a higher tagging performance with these features, compared to baseline results on French social media bank.",
        "Moreover, experiments on English social media content show that our model improves over previous works on these data."

        "There are many challenges inherent to applying standard natural language analysis techniques to social media.",
        "On-line conversational texts, such as tweets are quite challenging for text mining tools, and in particular for opinion mining, as they contain very little contextual information and assume too much implicit knowledge.",
        "They expose much more language variation and tend to be less grammatical than regular texts such as news articles or books.",
        "Furthermore, they contain unusual capitalization, and make frequent use of emoticons, abbreviations and hash-tags, which can form an important part of their inner meaning (Maynard et al., 2012).",
        "Conventional natural language processing tools for regular texts have achieved reasonably high accuracy thanks to machine learning techniques on large annotated data set.",
        "However, ?off the shelf?",
        "language processing systems fail to work on social media data and their performance on this domain degrade very fast.",
        "For example, in English Part-Of-Speech tagging, the accuracy of the Stanford tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003) falls from 97% on Wall Street Journal text to 85% accuracy on Twitter (Gimpel et al., 2011), similarly the MElt POS tagger (Denis and Sagot, 2012) drops from 97.7% on the French Treebank (called the FTB-UC by (Candito and Crabb?e, 2009)) to 85.2% on on-line conversational texts (Seddah et al., 2012).",
        "In Named Entity Recognition, the CoNLL-trained Stanford recognizer achieves 44% F-measure (Ritter et al., 2011), down from 86% on the CoNLL test set (Finkel et al., 2005); regarding parsing, see for example (Foster et al., 2011; Seddah et al., 2012), poor performances have been reported for different state-of-the-art parsers applied to English and French social media content.",
        "The main objective of this work is to implement a dedicated Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagger for French social media content such as Twitter, Facebook, blogs, forums and customer reviews.",
        "We used the first user-generated content resource for French presented by Seddah et al. (2012), which contains a fine-grained tag set and has been extracted from various social media contents.",
        "We have designed and implemented a POS tagger considering one of the well-known discriminative type of sequence-based methods; Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "To deal with sparsity and unknown ",
        "1764 words, we have applied unsupervised techniques to enrich the feature set.",
        "Finally, we have evaluated our tagger performance with different configurations on annotated corpora from French social media.",
        "We will first present related work in Part-Of-Speech tagging (Section 2) on noisy data like social media content.",
        "In Section 3, the annotated dataset and its characteristics (e.g., tag set) are described.",
        "Section 4 presents the result of applying the MElt POS tagger to user generated text as our baseline (Seddah et al., 2012).",
        "In Section 5, we explain how we design and implement our POS tagger.",
        "Section 6 is devoted to experiments and performance of our tagger.",
        "Section 7 describes the evaluation of the new tagger on English social media texts.",
        "Conclusion and future work are given in Section 8.",
        "2 Related work Online conversational texts, typified by micro-blogs, chat, and text messages, are a challenge for natural language processing.",
        "Unlike the highly edited genres for which conventional NLP tools have been de-veloped, conversational texts contain many non-standard lexical items and syntactic patterns.",
        "These are the result of unintentional errors, dialectal variation, conversational ellipsis, topic diversity, and creative use of language and orthography (Eisenstein, 2013) The language technology research community proposes two approaches to deal with noisy texts, namely normalization and domain adaptation, which are briefly described here.",
        "2.1 Normalization One way to deal with ill-formed language is to turn it into a well-formed language as a pre-processing task: ?normalizing?",
        "social media or SMS messages to better conform to the language that the technology expects.",
        "For example, (Han and Baldwin, 2011) propose the lexical normalization of short text messages, such as tweets, based on string and distributional similarity.",
        "They describe a method to identify and normalize ill-formed words.",
        "Word similarity and context are exploited to select the best candidate for noisy tokens.",
        "2.2 Domain adaptation The other approach is instead to adapt the tools to fit the text.",
        "A series of papers has followed the mold of ?NLP for Twitter,?",
        "including POS tagging (Gimpel et al., 2011; Owoputi et al., 2013), named entity recognition (Finin et al., 2010; Ritter et al., 2011; Xiaohua et al., 2011), parsing (Foster et al., 2011), dialog modeling (Ritter et al., 2010) and summarization (Hutton and Kalita, 2010).",
        "These works adapt various parts of the natural language processing pipeline for social media text, and make use of a range of techniques (Preprocessing, New labeled data, New annotation schemes, Self training, Distributional features, Distance supervision) (Eisenstein, 2013).",
        "Recently, Seddah et al. (2012) followed the second approach on French social media content and provided new labeled data and annotation schemes.",
        "They applied the MElt POS tagger (Denis and Sagot, 2012) embedded within text normalization and correction to noisy user generated texts and presented baseline POS tagging and statistical constituency parsing results.",
        "3 Annotated Dataset A set of 1,700 sentences (38k tokens) has been extracted from various types of French Web 2.0 user generated content (Facebook, Twitter, Video games and medical web forums) by Seddah et al. (2012).",
        "They selected these corpora through direct examination of various search queries and ranked the texts according to their distance from the French Treebank style, by measuring noisiness using the kullback-Leibler divergence between the distribution of trigrams of characters in given corpus and the distribution of trigrams of characters in the French Treebank reference.",
        "Some properties of this corpora are shown in Table 1.",
        "They targeted the annotation scheme of the FTB-UC in order to annotate the French social media bank.",
        "The tagset includes 28 POS tags from FTB-UC and compound tags with additional categories specific to social media, including HT for Twitter hashtags and META for meta-textual tokens, such as 1765 Twitter's ?RT?.",
        "Twitter at-mention as well as URLs and e-mail addresses have been tagged NPP which is the main difference with other works on on-line conversational texts.",
        "The inter-annotator agreement rate in this corpora range between 93.4% for FACEBOOK data and 97.44% for JEUXVIDEOS.COM (Table 1) which indicates an almost perfect agreement on the corpus (Landis and Koch, 1977).",

(2012).",
        "They used FTB-UC as training, development and test data.",
        "First, they applied several correction processes in order to wrap the POS tagger to tag a sequence of tokens as close as possible to standard French and training corpus.",
        "Then, the MElt tagger has been used with a set of 15 language-independent rules, that aim at assigning the correct POS to tokens that belong to categories not found in training corpus (e.g., URLs, e-mail addresses, emoticons).",
        "The preliminary evaluation experiments with normalization and correction wrapper showed 84.72% and 85.28% token accuracy over annotated development and test set respectively.",

        "Our tagger is based on sequence labeling models (CRF), enabling arbitrary local features to be integrated into a log-linear model.",
        "We employed three categories of feature templates to deal with syntactic variations on social media contents and alleviating the data sparseness problem.",
        "5.1 Basic Feature Templates The feature templates we use here are a superset of the largely language independent features used by (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Toutanova and Manning, 2000; Toutanova et al., 2003).",
        "These features fall into two main categories.",

        "A second set of features directly models the context of the current word and tag: it includes the previous tag, surrounding word forms in a 5 tokens window.",

        "We used ?c: compact?",
        "option in Wapiti which enables model compaction at the end of the training.",
        "This removes all inactive observations from the model, leading to a much smaller model when an L1-penalty is used.",
        "Table 6 shows the result of each experiment, measured by token and sentence accuracy.",
        "It shows that word clustering is a very strong source of lexical knowledge and significantly increases the performance of our tagger.",
        "Feature Templates Token Accuracy % Sentence Accuracy % B 88.2 45.8 B+C1 90.8 49.9 B+C2 90.3 50.3 B+C1+C2 91.9 51.1 B: Basic Feature Templates C1: Brown word-Clustering Feature Templates C2: MKCLS word-Clustering Feature Templates Table 6: Performance of new tagger based on CRF with different configurations The CRF model with all set of features (B+C1+C2) is the best model with 91.9% and 51.1% token and sentence accuracy on 10-fold cross validation.",
        "All of these tagging accuracies are significantly above previous results on the French social bank (baseline).",
        "4 http://wapiti.limsi.fr/ 5 http://mlcomp.org/ 1769 7 Evaluation on English social media Content In order to implement a tagger for English dedicated to social media content, we used the publicly available clusters data set (Owoputi et al., 2013) to build Brown clustering features.",
        "Moreover we performed the same process as in Section 5.2.2 in order to provide MKCLS clustering features with English Twitter data (1 million tweets obtained from 6 ).",
        "We applied our tagger with the best configuration to the annotated dataset provided by Ritter et al. (2011).",
        "This dataset contains 800 tweets that have been annotated with the Penn Treebank (PTB) tagset (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "We trained and test our system with 10-fold cross validation.",

        "Due to the large number of tokens (50 K), we trained and tested our tagger with a 5-fold cross validation setup.",
        "Our new tagger performance as well as the other taggers results are given in Table 8.",

        "0.3 Table 8: Evaluation on Chat data with PTB tags 8 Conclusion and Future Work In this paper, we have presented an innovative work on POS tagging for French social media noisy input.",
        "Because of the specific phenomena encountered in such data and also because of the lack of large training corpus, we proposed a discriminative sequence labeling model (CRF) enhanced with several type of features.",
        "After experimenting different configurations of features, we achieved 91.9% token accuracy on target corpus.",
        "Moreover, experiments on English social media contents show that our model obtains further improvement over previous works on these data and could be reproduced for other languages.",
        "In the future, we plan to pursue this work in two main directions: (a) Integrate the new tagger with a robust syntactic parser and investigate its impact on dependency parsing applied to social media and (b) evaluate the impact of POS tagging on opinion mining on micro-blogs, since this parser is the core component of an opinion mining system applied in different social-media analytics projects.",
