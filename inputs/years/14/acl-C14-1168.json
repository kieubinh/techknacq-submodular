        "Twitter contains a vast amount of information, including first stories and breaking news (Petrovic et al., 2010), fingerprints of public opinions (Jiang et al., 2011) and recommendations of relevance to potentially very small target groups (Benson et al., 2011).",
        "In order to automatically extract this information, we need to be able to analyze tweets, e.g., determine the part-of-speech (POS) of words and recognize named entities.",
        "Tweets, however, are notoriously hard to analyze (Foster et al., 2011; Eisenstein, 2013; Baldwin et al., 2013).",
        "The challenges include dealing with variations in spelling, specific conventions for commenting and retweeting, frequent use of abbreviations and emoticons, non-standard syntax, fragmented or mixed language, etc.",
        "Gimpel et al. (2011) showed that we can induce POS tagging models with high accuracy on in-sample Twitter data with relatively little annotation effort.",
        "Learning taggers for Twitter data from small amounts of labeled data has also been explored by others (Ritter et al., 2011; Owoputi et al., 2013; Derczynski et al., 2013).",
        "Hovy et al. (2014), on the other hand, showed that these models overfit their respective samples and suffer severe drops when evaluated on out-of-sample Twitter data, sometimes performing even worse than newswire models.",
        "This may be due to drift on Twitter (Eisenstein, 2013) or simply due to the heterogeneous nature of Twitter, which makes small samples biased.",
        "So while existing systems perform well on their own (in-sample) data sets, they over-fit the samples they were induced from, and suffer on other (out-of-sample) Twitter data sets.",
        "This bias can, at least in theory, be corrected by learning from additional unlabeled tweets.",
        "This is the hypothesis we explore in this paper.",
        "We present a semi-supervised learning method that does not require additional labeled in-domain data to correct sample bias, but rather leverages pools of unlabeled Twitter data.",
        "However, since taggers trained on newswire perform poorly on Twitter data, we need additional guidance when utilizing the unlabeled data.",
        "This paper proposes distant supervision to help our models learn from unlabeled data.",
        "Distant supervision is a weakly supervised learning paradigm, where a knowledge resource is exploited to gather (possible noisy) training instances (Mintz et al., 2009).",
        "Our basic idea is to can use linguistic analysis of linked websites as a novel kind of distant supervision for learning how to analyze tweets.",
        "We explore standard sources of distant supervision, such as Wiktionary for POS tagging, but we also propose to use the linked websites of tweets with URLs as supervision.",
        "The intuition is that we can use websites to provide a richer linguistic context for our tagging decisions.",
        "We exploit the fact that tweets with URLs provide a one-to-one map between an unlabeled instance and the source of supervision, making this ",

        "Note that we use linked websites only for semi-supervised learning, but do not require them at test time.",
        "Our semi-supervised learning method enables us to learn POS tagging and NER models that perform more robustly across different samples of tweets than existing approaches.",
        "We consider both the scenario where a small sample of labeled Twitter data is available, and the scenario where only newswire data is available.",
        "Training on a mixture of out-of-domain (WSJ) and in-domain (Twitter) data as well as unlabeled data, we get the best reported results in the literature for both POS tagging and NER on Twitter.",
        "Our tagging models are publicly available at https://bitbucket.org/lowlands/ttagger-nsd 2 Tagging with not-so-distant supervision We assume that our labeled data is highly biased by domain differences (Jiang and Zhai, 2007), population drift (Hand, 2006), or by our sample size simply being too small.",
        "To correct this bias, we want to use unlabeled Twitter data.",
        "It is well-known that semi-supervised learning algorithms such as self-training sometimes effectively correct model biases (McClosky et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2009).",
        "This paper presents an augmented self-training algorithm that corrects model bias by exploiting unlabeled data and not-so-distant supervision.",
        "More specifically, the idea is to use hyperlinks to condition tagging decisions in tweets on a richer linguistic context than what is available in the tweets.",
        "This semi-supervised approach gives state-of-the-art performance across available Twitter POS and NER data sets.",
        "The overall semi-supervised learning algorithm is presented in Figure 1.",
        "The aim is to correct model bias by predicting tag sequences on small pools of unlabeled tweets, and re-training the model across several iterations to gradually correct model bias.",
        "Since information from hyperlinks will be important, the unlabeled data U is a corpus of tweets containing URLs.",
        "We present a baseline and four system proposals that only differ in their treatment of the predict() function.",
        "In the SELF-TRAINING baseline, predict() corresponds to standard Viterbi inference on the unlabeled Twitter data.",
        "This means, the current model v is applied to the tweets by disregarding the websites in the tweet-website pairs, i.e., tagging x without considering w. Then the automatically tagged tweets are added to the current pool of labeled data and the procedure is iterated (line 7-11 in Figure 1).",
        "In the WEB method, we additionally use the information from the websites.",
        "The current model v is used to predict tags for the pooled tweets and the website they linked to.",
        "For all the words that occur both in a tweet and on the corresponding website, we then project the tag most frequently assigned to those words on the website to their occurrences in the tweet.",
        "This enables us to basically condition the tag decision for each such word on its accumulated context on the website.",
        "The assumption of course being that the word in the tweet has the part-of-speech it most often has on the website linked to.",
        "1784 Example Here is an example of a tweet that contains a URL: (1) #Localization #job: Supplier / Project Manager Localisation Vendor - NY, NY, United States http://bit.ly/16KigBg #nlppeople The words in the tweet are all common words, but they occur without linguistic context that could help a tagging model to infer whether these words are nouns, verbs, named entities, etc.",
        "However, on the website that the tweet refers to, all of these words occur in context: (2) The Supplier/Project Manager performs the selection and maintenance .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "For illustration, the Urbana-Champaign POS tagger 1 incorrectly tags Supplier in (1) as an adjective.",
        "In (2), however, it gets the same word right and tags it as a noun.",
        "The tagging of (2) could potentially help us infer that Supplier is also a noun in (1).",
        "Obviously, the superimposition of tags in the WEB method may change the tag of a tweet word such that it results in an unlikely tag sequence, as we will discuss later.",
        "Therefore we also implemented type-constrained decoding (T?ackstr?om et al., 2013), i.e., prune the lattice such that the tweet words observed on the website have one of the tags they were labeled with on the website (soft constraints), or, alternatively, were forced during decoding to have the most frequent tags they were labeled with (hard constraint decoding), thereby focusing on licensed sequences.",
        "However, none of these approaches performed significantly better than the simple WEB approach on held-out data.",
        "This suggests that sequential dependencies are less important for tagging Twitter data, which is of rather fragmented nature.",
        "Also, the WEB approach allows us to override transitional probabilities that are biased by the observations we made about the distribution of tags in our out-of-domain data.",
        "Furthermore, we combine the not-so-distant supervision from linked websites (WEB) with supervision from dictionaries (DICT).",
        "The idea here is to exploit the fact that many word types in a dictionary are actually unambiguous, i.e., contain only a single tag.",
        "In particular, 93% of the word types in Wiktionary 2 are unambiguous.",
        "Wiktionary is a crowdsourced tag dictionary that has previously been used for minimally supervised POS tagging (Li et al., 2012; T?ackstr?om et al., 2013).",
        "In the case of NER, we use a gazetteer that combines information on PER, LOC and ORG from the KnownLists of the Illinois tagger.",
        "3 For this gazetteer, 79% of the word types contained only a single named entity tag.",
        "We experiment with a model that uses the dictionary only (DICT) and two ways to combine the two sources.",
        "In the former setup, the current model is first applied to tag the tweets, then any token that appears in the dictionary and is unambiguous is projected back to the tweet.",
        "The next two methods are combinations of WEB and DICT: either first project the predicted tags from the website and then, in case of conflicts, overrule predictions by the dictionary (WEB?DICT), or the other way around (DICT?WEB).",
        "The intuition behind the idea of using linked websites as not-so-distant supervision is that while tweets are hard to analyze (even for humans) because of the limited context available in 140 character messages, tweets relate to real-world events, and Twitter users often use hyperlinks to websites to indicate what real-world events their comments address.",
        "In fact, we observed that about 20% of tweets contain URLs.",
        "The websites they link to are often newswire sites that provide more context and are written in a more canonical language, and are therefore easier to process.",
        "Our analysis of the websites can then potentially inform our analysis of the tweets.",
        "The tweets with the improved analyses can then be used to bootstrap our tagging models using a self-training mechanism.",
        "Note that our method does not require tweets to contain URLs at test time, but rather uses unlabeled tweets with URLs during training to build better tagging models for tweets in general.",
        "At test time, these models can be applied to any tweet.",
        "1 http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/demo/pos/ 2 http://en.wiktionary.org/ We used the Wiktionary version derived by Li et al. (2012).",
        "3 http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/page/software_view/NETagger 1785 3 Experiments 3.1 Model In our experiments we use a publicly available implementation of conditional random fields (CRF) (Laf- ferty et al., 2001).",
        "4 We use the features proposed by Gimpel et al. (2011), in particular features for word tokens, a set of features that check for the presence of hyphens, digits, single quotes, upper/lowercase, 3 character prefix and suffix information.",
        "Moreover, we add Brown word cluster features that use 2 i for i ?",
        "1, ..., 4 bitstring prefixes estimated from a large Twitter corpus (Owoputi et al., 2013), which is publicly available.",
        "5 We use a pool size of 1000 tweets.",
        "We experimented with other pool sizes {500,2000} showing similar performance.",
        "The number of iterations i is set on the development data.",
        "For NER on websites, we use the Stanford NER system (Finkel et al., 2005) 6 with POS tags from the LAPOS tagger (Tsuruoka et al., 2011).",
        "7 For POS we found it to be superior to use the current POS model for re-tagging websites; for NER it was slightly better to use the Stanford NER tagger and thus off-line NER tagging rather than retagging the websites in every iteration.",
        "3.2 Data In our experiments, we consider two scenarios, sometimes referred to as unsupervised and semi-supervised domain adaptation (DA), respectively (Daum?e et al., 2010; Plank, 2011).",
        "In unsupervised DA, we assume only (labeled) newswire data, in semi-supervised DA, we assume labeled data from both domains, besides unlabeled target data, but the amount of labeled target data is much smaller than the labeled source data.",

        "9 For NER, we use the CoNLL 2003 data sets of annotated newswire from the Reuters corpus.",
        "10 The in-domain training POS data comes from Gimpel et al. (2011), and the in-domain NER data comes from Finin et al. (2010) (FININ-TRAIN).",
        "These data sets are added to the newswire sets when doing semi-supervised DA.",
        "Note that for NER, we thus do not rely on expert-annotated Twitter data, but rely on crowdsourced annotations.",

        "For NER, we use the data set from Ritter et al. (2011) and the two data sets from Fromreide et al. (2014) as test sets.",
        "One is a manual correction of a held-out portion of FININ-TRAIN, named FININ-TEST; the other one is referred to as FROMREIDE-TEST.",
        "Since the different POS corpora use different tag sets, we map all of them corpora onto the universal POS tag set by Petrov et al. (2012).",
        "The data sets also differ in a few annotation conventions, e.g., some annotate URLs as NOUN, some as X.",
        "Moreover, our newswire tagger baselines tend to get Twitter-specific symbols such as URLs, hashtags and user accounts wrong.",
        "Instead of making annotations more consistent across data sets, we follow Ritter et al. (2011) in using a few post-processing rules to deterministically assign Twitter-specific symbols to their correct tags.",
        "The major difference between the NER data sets is whether Twitter user accounts are annotated as PER.",
        "We follow Finin et al. (2010) in doing so.",
        "Unlabeled data We downloaded 200k tweet-website pairs from the Twitter search API over a period of one week in August 2013 by searching for tweets that contain the string http and downloading the content of the websites they linked to.",
        "We filter out duplicate tweets and restrict ourselves to websites that contain more than one sentence (after removing boilerplate text, scripts, HTML, etc).",
        "13 We also require website and tweet to have at least one matching word that is not a stopword (as defined by the NLTK stopword list).",
        "14 Finally we restrict ourselves to pairs where the website is a subsite, because website head pages tend to contain mixed content that is constantly updated.",
        "The resulting files are all tokenized using the Twokenize tool.",
        "15 Tweets were treated as one sentence, similar to the approaches in Gimpel et al. (2011) and Owoputi et al. (2013); websites were processed by applying the Moses sentence splitter.",
        "16 The out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rates in Figure 2 show that in-domain training data reduces the number of unseen words considerably, especially in the NER data sets.",
        "They also suggest that some evaluation data sets share more vocabulary with our training data than others.",
        "In particular, we would expect better performance on FOSTER-TEST than on RITTER-TEST and HOVY-TEST in POS tagging, as well as better performance on FININ-TEST than on the other two NER test sets.",
        "In POS tagging, we actually do see better results with FOSTER-TEST across the board, but in NER, FININ-TEST actually turns out to be the hardest data set.",
        "4 Results 4.1 POS results Baselines We use three supervised CRF models as baselines (cf. the first part of Table 2).",
        "The first supervised model is trained only on WSJ.",
        "This model does very well on FOSTER-DEV and FOSTER-TEST, presumably because of the low OOV rates (Figure 2).",
        "The second supervised model is trained only on GIMPEL-TRAIN; the third on the concatenation of WSJ and GIMPEL-TRAIN.",
        "While the second baseline performs well on held-out data from its own sample (90.3% on GIMPEL-DEV), it performs poorly across our out-of-sample test and development sets.",
        "Thus, it seems to overfit the sample of tweets described in Gimpel et al. (2011).",
        "The third model trained on the concatenation of WSJ and GIMPEL-TRAIN achieves the overall best baseline performance (88.4% macro-average accuracy).",
