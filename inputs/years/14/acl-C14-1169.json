        "Statistical n-gram LMs have been successfully used for speech recognition and many other applications.",
        "They suffer from insufficiencies of training data and long-distance information, which limit the model generalization (Chien, 2006).",
        "The data sparseness problem is usually solved by backoff smoothing using lower-order language models (Katz, 1987; Kneser and Ney, 1995).",
        "The class-based language model was investigated where the class n-grams were calculated by considering the generation of concatenated classes rather than words (Brown et al., 1992).",
        "By incorporating the multidimensional word classes and considering the classes from various positions of left and right contextual information (Bai et al., 1998), the class n-gram can be improved (Yamamoto et al., 2003).",
        "A neural network language model (NNLM) was trained by linearly projecting the history words of an n-gram event into a continuous space (Bengio et al., 2003; Schwenk, 2007).",
        "Later, a recurrent neural network-based LM was investigated that shows better results than NNLM (Mikolov et al., 2010; Mikolov et al., 2011).",
        "Unsupervised class-based language models such as Random Forest LM (Xu and Jelinek, 2007), Model M (Chen, 2008) have been investigated that outperform a word-based LM.",
        "However, the long-distance information is captured by using a cache-based LM that takes advantage of the fact that a word observed earlier in a document could occur again.",
        "This helps to increase the probability of the seen words when predicting the next word (Kuhn and Mori, 1990).",
        "To compensate for the weakness of the n-gram models, latent topic analysis has been used broadly.",
        "Several techniques such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al., 1990; Bellegarda, 2000), probabilistic LSA (PLSA) (Hofmann, 1999; Gildea and Hofmann, 1999), and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) have been studied to extract the latent semantic information from a training This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "1793 corpus.",
        "The LSA, PLSA and LDA models have been used successfully in recent research work for LM adaptation (Bellegarda, 2000; Gildea and Hofmann, 1999; Mrva and Woodland, 2004; Tam and Schultz, 2005; Tam and Schultz, 2006; Haidar and O?Shaughnessy, 2011; Haidar and O?Shaughnessy, 2012b; Haidar and O?Shaughnessy, 2012a).",
        "Even so, the extracted topic information is not directly useful for speech recognition, where the latent topic of n-gram events should be of concern.",
        "In (chien and Chueh, 2008), a latent Dirichlet language model (LDLM) was proposed where the latent topic information was exploited from (n-1) history words through the Dirichlet distribution in calculating the n-gram probabilities.",
        "A topic cache language model was proposed where the topic information was obtained from long-distance history through multinomial distributions (Chueh and Chien, 2010).",
        "Topic-dependent-class-based n-gram LM was proposed where the LSA method was used to reveal latent topic information from noun-noun relations (Naptali et al., 2012).",
        "In (Bassiou and Kotropoulos, 2010), a PLSA technique enhanced with long-distance bigrams was used to incorporate the long-term word dependencies in determining word clusters.",
        "This technique was used in (Haidar and O?Shaughnessy, 2013b) and (Haidar and O?Shaughnessy, 2013a) for the PLSA and LDLM models respectively where the long-distance information was captured by using interpolated distanced n-grams and their parameters were estimated by using an expectation maximization (EM) procedure (Dempster et al., 1977).",
        "In (Chien and Chueh, 2011), the DCLM model was proposed to tackle the data sparseness and to extract the large-span information for the n-gram model.",
        "In this model, the topic structure in LDA is assumed to derive the hidden classes of histories in calculating the language model.",
        "A Bayesian class-based language model was presented where a variational Bayes-EM procedure was used to compute the model parameters.",
        "Also, a cache DCLM model was proposed to capture the long-distance information beyond the n-gram window.",
        "However, in the DCLM model (Chien and Chueh, 2011), the class information of the history words was obtained from the n-gram events of the corpus.",
        "Here, the long-range information outside the n-gram window is not captured.",
        "In this paper, we present an IDCLM model to capture the long-range information in the DCLM using the interpolated distanced n-grams.",
        "The n-gram probabilities of the proposed IDCLM model are computed by mixing the component distanced word probabilities for classes and the interpolated class information for histories.",
        "Similar to the DCLM model, the parameters of the IDCLM model are computed by using the variational Bayesian-EM procedure.",
