        "Dialogue between co-located participants is possibly the most common form of language use (Clark, 1996).",
        "It is highly interactive (time is shared between two participants), interlocutors can refer to objects in their visual field (space is also shared), and visual cues such as gaze or pointing gestures often play a role (shared time and space).",
        "Most computational dialogue research focuses only one of these constraints.",
        "In this paper, we present a model that processes incrementally (i.e., can potentially work interactively), can make use of the visual world by symbolically representing objects in a scene, and incorporate gaze and gestures.",
        "The model can learn from conversational data and can potentially be used in an application for a situated dialogue system, such as an autonomous robot.",
        "In the following section we will provide background and present related work.",
        "That will be followed by a description of the task and the model.",
        "In Section 4 we will show how our model performs in two experiments, the first uses speech and a visual scene, the second incorporates visual cues.",
        "2 Background and Related Work 2.1 Background: Incremental Dialogue Processing Dialogue systems that process incrementally produce behavior that is perceived by human users to be more natural than systems that use a turn-based approach (Aist et al., 2006; Skantze and Schlangen, 2009; Skantze and Hjalmarsson, 2010).",
        "Incremental dialogue has seen improvements in speech recognition (Baumann et al., 2009), speech synthesis (Buschmeier et al., 2012), and dialogue management (Bu?",
        "et al., 2010; Selfridge et al., 2012).",
        "Futhermore, architectures for incremental dialogue systems have been proposed (Schlangen and Skantze, 2009; Schlangen and Skantze, 2011) and incremental toolkits are also available (Baumann and Schlangen, 2012).",
        "In this paper, we approach natural language understanding (NLU), which aims to map an utterance to an intention, as a component in the incremental model of dialogue processing as described in (Schlangen and Skantze, 2011; Schlangen and Skantze, 2009), where incremental systems consist of a network of processing modules.",
        "Each module has a left buffer and a right buffer, where a typical module takes input ",
        "1803 Figure 1: Example of an IU network composed of words, parts of speech (POS), a semtic representation (Robust Minimal Recursion Semantics; RMRS), and NLU modules.",
        "Solid arrows represent GRIN links and the dotted lines represent SLLs.",
        "The utterance take the red cross is represented as word IUs, which are GRIN by the part of speech tags, phrase-structure parse, semantic representation, and the intention.",
        "Note that red and cross are GRIN by the same syntactic IU, which in turn is GRIN by two semantic IUs.",
        "Succeeding levels of IUs are shifted slightly to the right, representing a processing delay.",
        "The X14 slot in the bolded NLU frame refers to the cross-shaped object in the game board on the right.",
        "from its left buffer, performs some kind of processing on that data, and places the processed result onto its right buffer.",
        "The data are packaged as the payload of incremental units (IU) which are passed between modules.",
        "The IUs themselves are also interconnected via so-called same level links (SLL) and grounded-in links (GRIN), the former allowing the linking of IUs as a growing sequence, the latter allowing that sequence to convey what IUs directly affect them.",
        "See Figure 1 for an example; each layer represents a module in the IU-module network and each node is an IU in the IU network.",
        "The focus of this paper is the top layer (module), but how it is produced depends on the layers below it.",
        "2.2 Related Work The work presented in this paper connects and extends recent work in grounded semantics (Roy, 2005; Hsiao et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2012; Chai et al., 2014), which aims to connect language with the world, but typically does not work incrementally; semantic parsing / statistical natural language understanding via logical forms (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2009), dependency-based compositional semantics (Liang et al., 2011), neural networks (Huang and Er, 2010), Markov Logic Networks (Meurs et al., 2008; Meza-Ruiz et al., 2008), and Dynamic Bayesian Networks (Meurs et al., 2009); see also overviews of NLU in (De Mori et al., 2008; Tur and De Mori, 2011), but typically neither provide situated interpretations nor incremental specifications of the representations; incremental NLU (DeVault et al., 2009; DeVault et al., 2011; Aist et al., 2007; Schlangen and Skantze, 2009), which focuses on incrementality, but not on situational grounding; as well as integration of gaze into language understanding (Prasov and Chai, 2010).",
        "We move beyond this work in that we present a model that is incremental, uses a form of grounded se-mantics, can easily incorporate multi-modal information sources, and which inference can be performed quickly, satisfying the demands of real-time dialogue.",
        "3 Task and Model 3.1 Task The task for our model is as follows: to compute at any moment a distribution over possible intentions which the speaker wanted to convey in the utterance, expressed as semantic frames, given the unfolding utterance and information about the state of the world in which the utterance is happening.",
        "The slots of these frames are to be filled with semantic constants, that is, they are uniquely resolved, if appropriate, to objects in the shared environment.",
        "This is illustrated in Figure 1 where the words of the utterance give 1804 rise to the part-of-speech tags, the incrementally growing syntax, semantic representation, and, finally, the intention.",
        "Note how x14 in the bolded NLU frame resolves to an object identifier for a real object in the shared scene (red cross in the bottom-left of the game board shown on the right in the figure).",
        "3.2 Model Kennington et al., (2013) presented a simple, incremental model of NLU, which is an update model (i.e., increments build on previous ones) and which can potentially work in real time and in situated environments.",
        "The goal of the model is to recover I , the intention of the speaker behind the utterance, word by word.",
        "We observe U , the current word (or in this paper, a semantic meaning representation, see below) and an unobserved mediating variable R which represents visual or abstract properties of the object of the intention.",
        "Formally, we are interested in P (I|U), the probability of a certain intention I underlying utterance U .",
        "We assume a latent variable R (pRoperties of entities in the world), and build a generative model (that is, model the joint P (I,R, U)).",
        "Going from P (I,R|U) and making certain independence assumptions, we arrive at P (I|U) = P (I) P (U) ?",
        "r?R P (U |R = r)P (R = r|I) (1) That is, we assume that R is only conditional on I , and U is only conditional on R, and we can move P (I) and P (U) out of the summation, as they do not depend on R. This is an update model in the usual sense that the posterior (P (I|U)) at one step becomes the prior (P (I)) at the next.",
        "P (R|I) provides the link between the intentions and the properties.",
        "Another variant of the model which we will use in this paper is as follows: we rewrite P (U |R) using Bayes?",
        "rule, which cancels P (U) and introduces P (R) into the summation, but P (R) can be dropped since (in this work) it can be approximated with a uniform distribution, yielding: P (I|U) = P (I) ?",
        "r?R P (R = r|U)P (R = r|I) (2) There are, however, three important differences between the realisation of our model and the one presented in Kennington et al., (2013), all of which are a direct result of replacing, as we do here, the n-gram model represented by P (U |R) with output from a parser that produces a Robust Minimal Recursion Semantics (RMRS) semantic representation (Copestake, 2007).",
        "Such a representation provides our model with a structured way to abstract over the surface forms.",
        "We will first give a brief explanation of the RMRS framework, then describe each of the three differences between our model and that of Kennington et al., (2013), namely (1) how the language grounds with the world, (2) how the frame is built, and (3) when to consider evidence for the slots in the frame.",
        "RMRS RMRS is a framework for representing semantics that factors a logical form into elementary predicates (EP).",
        "For example in Table 1, the first row represents the first word of an utterance, take, and the corresponding RMRS representation; the EPs take and addressee are produced.",
        "The EPs in this example have anchor variables and in most cases, an EP has an argument entity.",
        "Relations between EPs can be expressed via argument relations, e.g., for take in the table, there is an ARG1 relation, denoting addressee as the first argument of the predicate take.",
        "Other relations include ARG2 and BV (relating determiners to the words they modify).",
        "A full example of an utterance and corresponding RMRS representation can be found in Table 1, where each row in the word column makes up the words of the example utterance.",
        "In this paper we are interested in processing utterances incrementally.",
        "As argued in Peldzsus et al., (2012), RMRS is amenable to incremental processing by allowing for underspecification in how relations are represented (RMRS can also underspecify scope, but we don't consider that here).",
        "Table 1 has an example of an underspecified relation: when the second word the is uttered, the RMRS segment predicts that the entity represented by x14 will be the ARG2 relation of the EP for take, but the actual word that 1805 word RMRS segment take a7 : addressee(x8), a1 : take(e2), ARG1(a1, x8) the a13 : def(), ARG2(a1, x14), BV (a13, x14) red a33 : red(e34), ARG1(a33, x14) cross a19 : cross(x14) next to a49 : next(e50), ARG1(a49, x14), ARG2(a49, x53) the a52 : def(), BV (a52, x53) blue a72 : blue(e73), ARG1(a72, x53) piece a58 : piece(x53) Table 1: Example RMRS representation for the utterance take the red cross next to the blue piece.",
        "Each row represents an increment of the utterance.",
        "produces the EP that has x14 as an argument has not yet been uttered.",
        "Each row in the table represents what we would want an RMRS parser to produce for our model at each word increment.",
        "A more detailed explanation of RMRS can be found in Copestake (2007).",
        "We will now discuss the three key differences of our model with that of previous work.",
        "(1) Grounding Semantics with the Visual World In Kennington et al., (2013), the utterance was represented via n-grams, which was used to ground with the world.",
        "Here, we ground RMRS structures with the world.",
        "For example, Figure 1 shows which words produced which RMRS increments; our model learns the co-occurances between those increments and properties of objects (real properties such as colors, shapes, and spatial placements, or abstract properties; e.g., take is a property of the action take).",
        "(2) Building the Frame In this paper, intentions are represented as frames.",
        "However, unlike Kennington et al., (2013), we don't assume beforehand that we know the slots of the frame.",
        "To determine the slots, we turn again to RMRS and build a slot for each entity that is produced (more on this below).",
        "This kind of frame, coupled with the RMRS representation, shows not just a meaning representation, but also interpretation of the representation in the current model (the real situation / visual domain of discourse), outputted incrementally making our model fully incremental in the sense of Heintze et al., (2010).",
        "The final, bolded NLU frame in Figure 1 shows the addressee (in this case, the dialogue system) as the recipient of the request, the request itself is a take request, where the object to be taken is obj5, as indexed by the real world, and that object happens to be red (i.e., e12 represents the notion of redness).",
        "(3) Driven by Sematics Another important difference is when to consider the semantic evidence and when to ignore it, in terms of when to apply the model for interpretation of the slots.",
        "In Kennington et al., (2013), each slot in the frame was processed at each increment in the entire utterance, regardless of whether n-grams in that segment contributed to the interpretation of that slot.",
        "In our approach, again, we turn to RMRS.",
        "At each word increment, RMRS produces a corresponding, underspecified semantic meaning represenation which is added to at the next increment.",
        "Our model takes the new information and only attempts to process the interpretation for those ?active?",
        "entities.",
        "For example, by the time red is uttered in Figure 1, the processing for entities x8, e2, and e12 is complete, but the processing for x14 is under way, and active as long as x14 is referenced as an entity in the RMRS increment.",
        "With these important extensions, our model of NLU is highly driven by the semantic meaning representation that is being built incrementally for the utterance.",
        "We will now show through two experiments how our approach improves upon previous work.",
        "4 Experiments Similar to Kennington et al., (2013), we use the model represented formally in Equation 2, where P (R|U) is realised using a maximum entropy classifier (ME) that predicts properties from RMRS evidence.",
        "1 We use the German RMRS parser described in Peldszus et al (2012), Peldszus and Schlangen (2012) which is a top-down PCFG parser that builds RMRS structure incrementally with the parse.",
        "We train an individual model for each RMRS entity type (e.g., e and x), where the features are the entity type, relations, and predicates of an RMRS increment and the class label are the visual properties.",
        "1 http://opennlp.apache.org/ 1806 The RMRS representations are not checked for accuracy (i.e., they do not represent ground truth); we use the top-predicted output of the RMRS parser explained in Peldszus et al (2012).",

        "This corpus was collected in a Wizard-of-Oz study, where the user goal was to instruct the computer to pick up, delete, rotate or mirror puzzle tiles on a rectangular board (as in Figure 2), and place them onto another board.",
        "For each utterance, the corpus records the state of the game board before the utterance, the immediately preceding system action, and the intended interpretation of the utterance (as understood by the Wizard) in the form of a semantic frame specifying action-type and arguments, where those arguments are objects occurring in the description of the state of the board.",

        "Procedure To make our work comparable to previous work, results were obtained by averaging the results of a 10-fold validation on 1489 Pento boards (i.e., utterances+context, as in (Kennington and Schlangen, 2012)).",

        "For example, each of the values for the gold slots in Figure 3 exist in the example frame our model would produce in Figure 4, marking each gold slot as correct, and the entire frame as correct since all three were correct together.",

        "Our model is general in that it doesn't fit a template or ontology like other NLU approaches (though we would need to determine how a dialogue manager would make use of such a frame), and grounds the semantic representation with a symbolic representation of the visual world.",
        "It works incrementally and can incorporate other modalities incrementally.",
        "It improves overall upon previous work that used a similar model, but relied on n-grams.",
        "Our model implicitely handles complex utterances that use spatial language.",
        "However, we leave important aspects, such as negation in an utterance, to future work (they were not very common in our data).",
        "The experiments in this paper were done off-line, but we have a real-time system currently working.",
        "Our model incorporates in real-time the gesture and gaze information as it is picked up by the sensors, as well as the speech of the user.",
