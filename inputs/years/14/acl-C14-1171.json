        "In recent years, the increasing usage of large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) systems to transcribe audio recordings from different sources (e.g. Youtube videos, TV programs, DVD movies, meetings, etc) has sparked the need of accurate, fast and cost-effective methods to estimate the quality of ASR output.",
        "This need contrasts with the fact that, after decades of progress in ASR research, the established evaluation protocol is based on computing word error rate scores (WER) 1 over large test sets of hand-crafted reference transcriptions.",
        "Indeed, despite its reliability, reference-based performance assessment has an evident drawback represented by the cost of acquiring manual transcripts.",
        "Besides increasing the cost-effectiveness of ASR evaluation routines, bypassing this bottleneck has several other motivations.",
        "From an application perspective, for instance, reference-free quality estimation methods could be used to: i) decide at run-time whether a given input signal has been properly recognized (e.g. if a user spoken utterance needs to be repeated in a dialogue application), ii) decide if an automatic transcription is acceptable as is (e.g. if manual revision is needed in an automatic subtitling application), or iii) select the best transcription among options from multiple ASR systems.",
        "When information about the inner workings of the system used to produce the transcriptions is acces-sible, current reference-free confidence estimation methods can supply ASR applications with reliable indicators about output reliability.",
        "This condition, however, does not always hold in the aforementioned scenarios.",
        "A clear motivating example is provided by the exponential growth of captioned TED Talks and Youtube videos, 2 for which no information is available about how transcriptions have been produced.",
        "In this case, neither reference-based methods, nor standard confidence measures can be applied to obtain useful quality estimates.",
        "Nevertheless, in this scenario, supplying reliable indicators of transcription quality has a huge market potential (e.g. to reduce the costs of manual revision/translation) which motivates our research.",
        "Focusing on these compelling needs, this paper investigates the automatic prediction of ASR output quality when: i) manual reference transcripts are not available and ii) information about the ",
        "1 The word error rate is the minimum edit distance between an hypothesis and the reference transcription.",
        "Edit distance is calculated as the number of edits (word insertions, deletions, substitutions) divided by the number of words in the reference.",
        "2 Since 2009, Youtube videos in English can be automatically captioned.",
        "In 2012, for the 72 hours of video uploaded per minute, such functionality was already available for 10 languages.",
        "Currently, more than 200 million Youtube videos have either automatic or human-created captions (source: http://goo.gl/9swYSS).",
        "1813 inner workings of the ASR system is not accessible.",
        "Casting the problem as a supervised regression task, we experiment in a range of testing conditions on a well-known LVCSR setting (i.e. the automatic transcription of TED talks).",
        "In this framework, we analyse the performance of various models (i.e. their capability to predict utterance-level WER scores) as a function of the different learning algorithms used, the proposed features, and the amount of training data available.",
        "Our features are categorized according to the type of information they aim to capture.",
        "Since the nature of the proposed features is a relevant aspect for the applicability of our approach, an important distinction is made between ?glass-box?",
        "and ?black-box?",
        "features, which are respectively informed and agnostic about systems?",
        "internal decoding strategies.",
        "The former can play an important role when all the intermediate processing steps are accessible (e.g. in the selection of the best possible transcription hy-pothesis).",
        "In contrast, black-box features have a wider applicability to situations where such information is not available (e.g. to estimate the quality of online video subtitles).",
        "Another important aspect relevant to our study is the relation between the accuracy of utterance-level quality predictions and the degree of homogeneity of training and test data.",
        "Indeed, as in any supervised learning framework, the similarity between training and test data has a direct impact on (classification and regression) results.",
        "In order to fully understand the potential of our approach, we hence measure performance variations under different levels of similarity between the data used to train the regressor and the data used for evaluation.",
        "To this aim, our experiments account for a range of possible conditions.",
        "These vary from the situation in which training and test are fully homogeneous (i.e. same dataset, with training instances produced by the same ASR system) to the more challenging situation where training and test are not homogeneous (i.e. different datasets, with training instances produced by different ASR systems).",
        "Our results, obtained with two different state-of-the-art algorithms for regression, demonstrate that in all such variable conditions our ASR quality estimation models lead to accurate predictions (i.e. close the word error rate scores calculated over reference transcripts).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first extensive investigation on reference-free and system-agnostic automatic estimation of ASR output quality.",
        "Along this direction, our main contributions can be summarized as follows: 1.",
        "We propose a supervised, application-oriented approach to ASR quality estimation that bypasses the need of manual reference transcriptions and is system-independent.",
        "2.",
        "We evaluate our method with different learning algorithms and in different conditions, showing that its estimates closely approximate the WER scores calculated over reference transcripts.",
        "3.",
        "We perform feature analysis, isolating the contribution of each feature set in all the testing conditions.",
        "4.",
        "We analyse the learning curves of our best models, investigating the relation between performance results and the amount of data needed for training.",
        "Overall, these contributions provide useful insights about the feasibility of automatic ASR quality esti-mation, opening interesting research avenues relevant for system development and for ASR applications.",
        "2 Related Work As a reference-free automatic evaluation method, our work introduces a valid application-oriented alternative to the standard evaluation protocols used within current ASR evaluation campaigns such as IWSLT (Federico et al., 2011; Federico et al., 2012; Cettolo et al., 2013).",
        "3 Besides that, our approach to ASR quality estimation (QE) also differs from the well-established confidence estimation (CE) techniques proposed in previous ASR literature (Sukkar and Lee, 1996; Evermann and Woodland, 2000; Wessel et al., 2001; Sanchis et al., 2012; Seigel, 2013, inter alia).",
        "Such difference firstly relies in the fact that, while in CE is the system itself that provides an indicator of the reliability of its output transcriptions, QE aims to provide an external and more objective measure of goodness through WER predictions.",
        "A 3 See http://www.iwslt2013.org/ for details about the last edition of the IWSLT Workshop held in 2013.",
        "1814 second (related) difference is that, in contrast with previous CE methods that heavily rely on information about the internal behaviour of the ASR system, our technique does not necessarily depend on the access to such information.",
        "This extends its applicability to scenarios (out of the scope of CE research) where the quality of transcriptions produced by (possibly unknown) ASR systems has to be evaluated/compared solely based on information about the input audio signals and the output transcriptions.",
        "An interesting approach exploiting ASR word accuracy estimates to automatically score the proficiency of non-native English speakers has been proposed by Yoon et al. (2010).",
        "To our knowledge this work is the most similar to the one presented here, although it differs in the application domain and several other aspects.",
        "First of all, similar to CE methods, it makes some use of glass-box features derived from knowledge about the ASR internal workings (e.g. word confidence and acoustic/language model probabilities).",
        "Secondly, the domain addressed is constrained to responses to prompted utterances, while in this paper we address a large unconstrained domain, namely the automatic transcription of lectures (TED talks) covering different topics.",
        "Finally, (Yoon et al., 2010) is based on a rather simple model whose performance is not carefully analysed from the learning point of view (e.g. by comparing the contribution different state-of-the-art algorithms) as we do here.",
        "The problem of automating system evaluation without a gold standard has been addressed also in other NLP areas.",
        "For instance, (Louis and Nenkova, 2013) recently addressed the assessment of machine-generated summaries without model summaries.",
        "The strongest parallelism with our work, however, can be found in the Machine Translation (MT) evaluation field, where the goal of bypassing the need of manually-created reference translations has motivated a large body of research.",
        "4 Quality estimation for MT and ASR have a number of commonalities.",
        "First, they both deal with a ?source?",
        "(respectively a sentence in a language L and an acoustic utterance) and an ?hypothesis?",
        "whose quality has to be estimated without references (respectively a translation in a language L1 and an automatic transcription of the audio signal).",
        "Second, they can be addressed at various granularities.",
        "Indeed, ASR output quality estimation is similar to its MT counterpart where research focused on quality predictions at word level (Ueffing and Ney, 2007; Bach et al., 2011), sentence level (Specia et al., 2009; Mehdad et al., 2012) and document level (Soricut and Echihabi, 2010).",
        "Third, both tasks are suitable for supervised machine learning methods, either for classification (Blatz et al., 2003; Quirk, 2004) or for regression (Specia et al., 2010; Specia, 2011).",
        "Finally, both tasks motivate efforts in designing features capable to capture the difficulty to process the source, the plausibility of the output hypothesis and (but not necessarily) the confidence of the decoding process (Felice, 2012; Rubino et al., 2013b).",
        "3 Approach We approach the automatic estimation of ASR output quality as a supervised regression problem.",
        "Given a training set of (signal, transcription, WER) instances, the task is to predict the WER of each instance in a test set of unseen (signal, transcription) pairs.",
        "Features.",
        "As shown in Table 1, the features used in our experiments (68 in total) can be categorized in four main groups.",
        "The first group (ASR features) includes several glass-box features proposed in previous literature on ASR confidence estimation (Litman et al., 2000; Gabsdil and Lemon, 2004; Goldwater et al., 2010; Higgins et al., 2011).",
        "These features are suitable only for the ideal situation in which information about systems?",
        "internal decoding strategies is available (as in the experiments discussed in ?4.1).",
        "We use them as a term of comparison to evaluate the usefulness of the other three groups (signal, hybrid and textual), which belong to the black-box type.",
        "These features, which are totally uninformed about the decoding process, have wider applicability to the system-independent ASR quality estimation tasks that represent our target scenario (see Sections 4.2 and 4.3).",
        "More in detail: ?",
        "ASR features aim to capture the confidence of the speech recognizer and the reliability of the whole decoding process.",
        "In our experiments, as we do not have access to decoders of other systems, they are computed only for the ASR system developed in our labs (Falavigna et al., 2013).",
        "These features 4 For a complete overview of the current approaches to MT quality estimation we refer the reader to the WMT12 and WMT13 shared task reports (Callison-Burch et al., 2012; Bojar et al., 2013).",

        "In Table 1 ?Total probabil-ity?",
        "is the weighted sum of log Language Model (LM) and log Acoustic Model (AM) probabilities.",
        "LM probability is computed with a 4-gram backoff LM, trained over about 5 billion words using the IRSTLM toolkit (Federico et al., 2008) and the modified shift-beta smoothing method.",
        "AM probability is computed using a set of tied-state triphone Hidden Markov Models having, as output state density, a mixture of Gaussian probability densities with diagonal covariance matrices.",
        "?Mean probability?",
        "is obtained dividing the total probability by the number of hypothesized ASR output items (words + silences).",
        "Confidence scores are computed averaging time posterior word probabilities (Evermann and Woodland, 2000).",
        "?Proportion of low confidence words?",
        "is the fraction of words having confidence values ?",
        "0.5.",
        "The remaining ASR features are directly extracted from word graphs and n-best lists scores.",
        "?",
        "Signal features aim to capture the difficulty to transcribe a given input looking at the signal as a whole.",
        "They are computed from raw vectors extracted through frame analysis (we employ 20ms analysis window and 10ms analysis step).",
        "For each analysed window, 12 Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are evaluated plus log energy.",
        "Then, for each given segment, minimum, maximum and mean values of raw energy, as well as the mean MFCCs values and total segment duration, are computed to form the signal feature vector.",
        "?",
        "Hybrid features provide a more fine-grained way to capture the difficulty of transcribing the signal.",
        "This is done by considering information about word and silence/noise regions, as well as their respective duration.",
        "These features are computed after having performed forced alignment between the input audio signal and the corresponding automatic hypotheses.",
        "Forced alignment is carried out with our ASR system (Falavigna et al., 2013), in order to detect audio segments related to words, hesitations and silences in the hypothesis.",
        "Pitch features have been computed with the Praat software tool (Boersma and Weenink, 2005).",
        "?",
        "Textual features aim to capture the plausibility (i.e. the fluency) of an output transcription.",
        "To this aim, we consider surface information (such as the number of words and the percentage of numbers/content-words/nouns/verbs in the hypothesis) as well as information about LM perplexity and probability of the hypothesis (both at the level of words and parts of speech) 5 .",
        "Feature selection is performed throughout all our experiments to maximize results and, at the same time, analyse the contribution of the proposed features.",
        "To this aim, we use Randomized Lasso, or stability selection (Meinshausen and B?uhlmann, 2010), which re-samples the training data several times and fits a Lasso regression model on each sample.",
        "Features that appear in a given number of samples are considered more informative for the task at hand, and hence retained (those marked in bold in Table 1 are the most informative ones based on the experiments described in Sections 4.2 and 4.3).",
        "Learning algorithms.",
        "To build our regression models we experimented with two non-parametric learning approaches: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004) and Extremely Randomized Trees (XT) (Geurts et al., 2006).",
        "SVMs are non-parametric deterministic algorithms that have been widely used in several fields, in particular in NLP where they are the state-of-the-art for various tasks.",
        "Extra-Trees are a tree-based ensemble method for supervised classification and regression that were also successfully used for MT quality estimation (de Souza et al., 2013; de Souza et al., 2014a).",
        "In XTs each tree can be parametrized differently.",
        "When a tree is built, the node splitting step is done at random by picking the best split among a random subset of the input features.",
        "The results of the individual trees are combined by averaging their predictions.",
        "Hyper-parameter optimization of the SVM (with Radial basis function kernel ?",
        "RBF) and XT models was performed using randomized search (Bergstra and Bengio, 2012).",

        "To experiment with situations of increasing complexity, we alternate conditions in which all the features (glass-box and black-box) can be used, training and test sets are non-/homogeneous, the quality estimator is trained on transcriptions generated by the same/different ASR systems.",
        "Data.",
        "The data used in the experiments consists of the audio recordings delivered for the IWSLT 2013 evaluation campaign (Cettolo et al., 2013).",
        "One of the tasks of IWSLT 2013 is the automatic transcription of English TED talks, a global set of conferences whose audio/video recordings are publicly available.",
        "The main challenges for ASR in these talks include: the large variability of topics (hence a large, unconstrained vocabulary), the presence of non-native speakers and a rather informal speaking style.",
        "Each IWSLT participant submitted one primary ASR output run for each of the talks included in the test set plus some optional contrastive ASR outputs.",
        "In addition, participants sent submissions for the ASR tracks delivered for the 2012 evaluation campaign.",
        "Our experiments have been carried out on the primary submissions, sent by 8 participants, related to the 2012 (consisting in 11 different talks) and 2013 (28 different talks) test sets.",
        "The 2012 test set has a total duration of around 1h45sec, it contains 1,118 reference sentences and 18,613 running words.",
        "On such dataset, participants?",
        "primary submissions achieved a mean utterance WER ranging from 10.5% to 18.4% (in this work a WER score is computed for each reference sentence, and mean utterance WER represents the average of sentence WERs).",
        "The 2013 test set has a total duration of around 3h55sec, it contains 2,238 reference sentences and 41,545 running words.",
        "On this dataset, primary participants?",
        "submissions achieve a mean utterance WER ranging from 15.9% to 30.8%.",
        "In our experiments, we always use 1,118 utterances for training the regressor and 1,120 for testing.",
        "To this aim, the IWSLT 2013 data is randomly sampled three times in training and test sets of such dimensions.",
        "While for the 2012 test set manual utterance segmentation has been provided by the organizers, for the 2013 data the participants had to employ their own automatic segmentation systems before decoding the audio tracks (thus resulting in a different number of ASR sentence hypotheses for each team).",
        "Hence, 1817 to ensure that each participant has the same number of ASR sentence hypotheses, an alignment with the reference manual segmentation has been performed in our experiments.",
        "Evaluation.",
        "Our evaluation is carried out in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE), a standard metric for regression problems.",

        "WER is calculated with the NIST SCLITE Scoring Package.",
        "7 As it is a measure of error, lower MAE scores indicate that our predictions are closer to the real WER calculated for each test instance against the reference transcripts.",

        "Baseline.",
        "Besides measuring performance in terms of global MAE, each model is compared against a common baseline for regression tasks.",
        "This baseline, which is particularly relevant in settings featuring different data distributions between training and test sets, is calculated by labelling each test instance with the mean WER score calculated on the training set.",

        "Our objective is to evaluate, on homogeneous datasets (sampled from IWSLT13), the output of ASR systems whose inner workings are not known (hence only black-box features can be used).",
        "To make our analysis more complete, we also evaluate the performance of models trained on a given ASR system to predict the WER of hypotheses produced by a different one.",
        "This situation is closer to application scenarios in which the evaluated ASR system is unknown and different from the one used to train the quality estimator.",

        "The results reported in Table 3 confirm that: i) the combination of black-box features (BB COMB) always leads to the best QE models, which significantly outperform the baseline, ii) the same holds also when each single group is used in isolation, iii) with less homogeneous training and test data, XT performs generally better than SVR.",
        "In addition, it's worth noting that when a QE model is trained and tested on data transcribed by the same ASR system the results are significantly better (the MAE is always about 1.0 6.0 points lower).",
        "Indeed, as also shown by the same behaviour of our baseline, this condition is simpler and more suitable for supervised learning methods.",
        "This depends on the fact that each ASR system has its own coherent behaviour, which results in transcriptions with similar characteristics that supervised models are able to learn (e.g. recurring errors, similar WER distributions).",
        "In contrast, when training and test data are produced by different ASR systems, supervised learning becomes more difficult and the output predictions less reliable.",
        "Each feature group is affected by this situation, but it is interesting to note that the Hybrid features are more robust than the other two groups to less homogeneous datasets.",
        "This can be explained by the fact that they are extracted after applying forced alignment by means of a third system, which is likely to normalise and reduce the difference between training and test data.",

        "This confirms their complementarity in predicting the quality of a transcribed utterance.",

        "To this aim, we measured performance variations when the same models (i.e. those obtained with the BB COMB set) are trained on different amounts of data.",
        "For each training set, nine subsets were created (with 10%, 20%,..., 90% of the data) by sub-sampling sentences from a uniform distribution.",
        "The process was iterated 5 times.",
        "Each subset was used to build the relative QE regressor, which was then evaluated on our test sets.",

        "As can be seen from all the curves, after an initial fluctuation of the MAE, performance results with 40% of the training data are comparable with those obtained using the whole training set.",
        "Moreover, it's worth remarking that in three out of four cases the models trained with such amount of data already outperform the baseline (for Z12 A13 the MAE is only 0.01 point higher).",
        "This suggests that reference-free, system-independent models for ASR quality estimation are able to provide informative predictions even with a limited amount (?400 manual transcripts) of training instances.",
        "1820 6 Conclusion We investigated the problem of automatically predicting the word error rate of an automatically-transcribed utterance in a large vocabulary continuous speech recognition setting.",
        "In such scenario, we proposed a supervised regression approach that bypasses the need of manual reference transcriptions and does not necessarily depend on information about system's confidence (first contribution of the pa-per).",
        "Then, by evaluating models obtained with different state-of-the-art learning algorithms, we showed that our automatic predictions outperform a strong baseline and closely approximate the WER scores calculated over reference transcripts (second contribution).",
        "Different feature groups have been proposed and their contribution has been analysed in a range of testing conditions of increasing difficulty (third contribution).",
        "This made possible to isolate informative features that significantly contribute to the performance of our quality estimation models, and to get useful insights about the potential of our approach when different sources of information (glass-box, black box features) are available.",
        "Finally, analysing the relation between prediction performance and the size of the training set, we showed that the results obtained with 40% of the data are already comparable to our best MAE (fourth contribution).",
        "Our analysis revealed a dependency between the performance of the quality estimation models and the degree of homogeneity between training and test data.",
        "This aspect is particularly relevant from the application perspective since in real working conditions the availability of large amounts of representative training instances is far from being guaranteed.",
        "In quality estimation for machine translation (a task featuring strong similarities with ours), these issues have recently motivated studies on domain adaptation and online learning techniques (de Souza et al., 2014b; Turchi et al., 2014).",
        "This suggests, as a first direction for future work, the investigation of approaches capable to better exploit the available training data and mitigate the impact of large differences between training and test instances.",
