        "The importance of anaphora resolution in various tasks is demonstrated by researchers by integrating anaphora resolution with answer extraction system, automatic summarization system, relation extraction system, document similarity identifier etc.",
        "Most of the anaphora resolution systems are developed for particular languages.",
        "The researchers have analyzed anaphors across languages at various levels such as syntactic, semantic, discourse, structured, and unstructured features.",

        "These languages have relatively free word order and clausal structures are more fixed order.",
        "Indian languages fall under the following broader families of languages, Indo-Aryan, Dravidian and Tibeto-Burman.",
        "Indo-Aryan family includes languages such as Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi etc, Dravidian includes languages such as Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Tibeto-Burman includes languages such as Bodo, Manipuri etc.",
        "Dravidian languages are highly agglutinated and have rich productive suffixation than the Indo-Aryan languages.",
        "Plural marker and case markers get affixed to the nouns and tense markers and Person, Number, Gender (PNG) markers affix with verbs.",
        "In certain Indo-Aryan languages such as Hindi, case 1825 markers occur as postpositions following the nouns.",
        "These postpositions are handled in the preprocessing stage to occur in the noun morphological analysis.",
        "Indian languages vary largely in the distinction of Number (singular/plural) and Gender in pronouns.",
        "Few of the Indian languages and their details of Number and Gender Distinction in those languages are presented in table 1.",
        "Language Number Distinction (singular/plural) Gender Distinction Hindi Yes No Sanskrit Yes Yes Punjabi Yes No Gujarati Yes No Assamese Yes No Bengali Yes No distinction for Masculine and Feminine.",
        "But there is animate-inani- mate distinction.",
        "Oriya Yes No Telugu Yes Masculine and others Kannada Yes Yes Malayalam Yes Yes Tamil Yes Yes Table 1: Variation of Pronouns with respect to Number and Gender The similarities and variations between languages in the number-gender characteristics of the pronouns is presented in Table 1.",
        "In the number characteristics the languages are similar whereas in the gender characteristics there are variations.",
        "The information in the table 1 brings forth the challenges in capturing the anaphor-antecedent PNG agreement for a generic anaphora resolution engine.",
        "With example 1, 2 and 3, we have demonstrated the variation in Gender, Number distinction in pronouns in Tamil (Ta), Bengali (Bn) and Hindi (Hi).",
        "Example 1 Ta:a) raamum giithavum cakotharan-cakothari.",
        "Ram(N)+inc Gita(N)+inc brother -sister.",

        "c) vaha aaTaviM kakshaa meM paTatii hai.",
        "Example 1 has three Tamil sentences.",
        "The second and third sentence has pronouns 'avan' he and 'aval' she, the third person masculine and the third person feminine pronouns respectively.",
        "Masculine pronoun in second sentence refers to the masculine noun 'raam' and the feminine pronoun in the third sentence refers to the feminine noun 'Gita' in the first sentence.",
        "Here the masculine and feminine pro-1826 nouns have a clear distinction.",
        "The three Tamil sentences in example 1 are translated to Bengali and Hindi.",
        "The Bengali translation is presented in example 2 and Hindi translation is presented in example 3.",
        "In example 2, the second and third sentence has 'se', the third person pronoun.",
        "In the second sen-tence, the pronoun 'se' refers to the masculine noun 'raam' and ?se?",
        "in the third sentence refers to feminine noun 'giitaa' in the first sentence.",
        "Here the third person pronoun does not have mascu-line/feminine distinction.",
        "Similarly in example 3, which has the Hindi translation, 'vaha', the third person pronoun does not have gender distinction.",
        "In sentence 2 of example 3, 'vaha' refers to the masculine noun and in sentence 3, 'vaha' refers to the feminine noun.",
        "These variations in Number and Gender distinction in pronouns pose challenges in coming up with a generic anaphoric engine.",
        "The pronoun and its agreement with its antecedents vary between the languages and to handle the agreement we require a language dependent mapping.",
        "3 Generic Anaphora Resolution Engine Most of the Indian languages are resource poor languages.",
        "The morphological richness of these lan-guages, help in building various high end NLP applications such as machine translation, anaphora resolution etc., with limited shallow parsed information without using sophisticated parsing tools.",
        "In this work we have tried to build a generic anaphora resolution engine using shallow parsed text.",
        "Similarities between Indian languages, described in the previous section, are tapped to come up with a generic approach for anaphora resolution in Indian languages.",
        "The variation in the antecedent-anaphor agreement mentioned in the section above is handled by an in-depth morphological analysis of the text.",
        "We have used CRFs, a linear graphical machine learning algorithm to resolve the antecedents.",
        "3.1 Preprocessing of Data We perform limited shallow parsing on the training and testing data.",
        "Both the data are pre-processed with morphological analyzer, Part-of-Speech (POS) tagger, Chunker, Clause boundary identifier and Named Entity Recognizer.",
        "Here morphological analysis, Part-of-Speech tagging, Chunking are obligatory.",
        "Clause boundary identification and Named Entity Recognition are optional pre-processing tasks.",
        "These two tasks add information, which can be used as constraint features in the machine learning approach.",
        "In this work, we perform a detailed morphological analysis for a given word.",
        "This is explained in the following section.",
        "The preprocessing tools available in Indian Language ?Indian Language Machine Translation (IL-ILMT) consortium are used.",
        "3.2 Detailed Morphological Analysis We perform an in-depth morphological analysis for a given word.",
        "In the in-depth morphological analysis we analyse both inflectional and derivational morphology.",
        "The in-depth morphological analysis gives the suffix (case markers with the nouns, tense-aspect-model with the verbs) and PNG characteristics of the words.",
        "These suffix information is used in the syntactic feature and verb suffix feature for the machine learning technique which are described further in section 3.4.",
        "The post-position occurring with the nouns, its syntactic association with the noun is identified in morphological processing stage and information is used as syntactic feature.",
        "The morphological analyser identifies the root word, its lexical category, gender, number, person, case (direct/oblige), case markers if the word is a noun and tense markers (vibhakthi as called in Indian traditional grammar) if the word is a verb and the suffixes.",

        "can be any gender.",
        "Number information can be singular, plural, dual or any.",
        "Person information can be 1st person, 2nd person, 3rd person or any.",

        "The noun phrases which agree with the pronoun in PNG should be selected as possible candidates for its antecedent.",
        "In training phase, the noun phrases which match with PNG of the pronoun and occur in between the anaphor and the antecedent are collected for each pronoun and given for training using the machine learning algorithm.",
        "The exact anaphor and antecedent pair forms positive pair and other noun phrases and anaphor form negative pairs for learning.",
        "In the testing phase all the noun phrases that match in PNG with the pronouns are collected from the current sentence and four prior sentences.",
        "The gender distinction and anaphor-antecedent agreement varies widely among Indian languages.",
        "In order to have a language independent engine, these variations have to be dynamically captured and the rules for checking PNG agreement have to be generated.",
        "We have used the gender information from the morphological analysis extracted with a set of heuristic rules to capture the variation in PNG agreement.",
        "The heuristic rules describe the possible genders that can match with the gender of the pronoun that varies between languages.",
        "The heuristic rules are presented below.",

        "Anaphora resolution is generally evaluated with performance measures such as Precision, Recall and F-measure.",
        "In this work, we have measured the performance with Precision, Recall and F-Measure and it is presented in table 4.",
        "Example 4 Ta: aalluNar rosaiyya villavil kalanthukkoNtaar.",

        "He gave the lecture there.)",
        "In above example 4, ?avar?",
        "(third honorific singular pronoun) in the second sentence, refers to a masculine noun phrase ?aalluNar rosaiyya?",
        "in the previous sentence.",
        "The honorific pronoun can also refer to a feminine pronoun.",
        "This possibility of referring to both the gender introduces more errors.",
        "In Hindi, most of the pronouns such as ?vaha?",
        "(he/she/it), ?usa?",
        "(he/she/it), ?unhone?",
        "(he/she hono-rofic) and ?khuda?",
        "(himself) etc., do not have gender distinction and can be used to refer to antecedents of both feminine and masculine.",
        "PNG agreement adds more challenges in anaphora resolution, due to which the system gives more false positives.",
        "In our algorithm we were able to reduce the number of false positives and obtained better precision by having positional features and the verb suffixes as learning features.",
        "For languages such as Hindi, we observe that there is necessity of having verb 1830 analysis in the text processing component.",
        "If we have this information as pre-processed data to the resolution engine, it can reduce ambiguity and improve the anaphora resolution.",
        "As it is seen from the results table we have obtained lesser scores for Bengali.",
        "In Bengali third person pronouns such as ?ami?",
        "(I), ?t?mi/tui/apni?",
        "(you), ?se/tini?",
        "(he/she), ?amra?",
        "(we), ?tara/tnara?",
        "(they), do not have masculine, feminine distinction, but there is animacy distinction.",
        "And also the verb has no gender agreement.",
        "This adds more challenge to anaphora resolution engine and hence lesser scores than other languages.",
        "We identify the animacy feature in the morphological analysis stage for all the languages, but for Bengali language it is not robust and it affects in the anaphora resolution.",
        "For such languages the order of NPs and syntactic roles play major role in anaphora resolution.",
        "The use of features such as Named Entities helps in improving the resolution of pronouns referring to person and location.",
        "The addition of clause boundary information improves resolution by adding structural constraints.",
        "5 Conclusion We have presented a generic anaphora resolution engine, which can be used for all Indian languages.",
        "The three languages, Hindi, Bengali, and Tamil, we have chosen are the most spoken languages belonging to two major language families of India, namely belonging to Indo-Aryan and Dravidian families respectively.",
        "Though the Indian languages have similarities, they vary in Person, Number, Gender distinction, which pose a challenge in building language independent engine.",
        "The engine is language independent as it uses the information from the in-depth morphological analysis.",
        "It is specifically designed in such a way that it is scalable and allows plug-n-play architecture.",
        "The core anaphora resolution engine uses CRFs a machine learning technique.",
        "This uses feature based learning and we have provided syntactic and positional based features obtained from in-depth morphological analysis.",
        "We have obtained encouraging evaluation results.",
        "The major contributions of this work are the following: a) Our attempt is first of its kind in Indian languages to develop a single generic engine, using machine learning.",
        "b) It is a known fact that most of the Indian languages are resource poor, hence we have used very minimal resources, only shallow parsing has been used.",
        "c) The results obtained are comparable to other reported works.",
