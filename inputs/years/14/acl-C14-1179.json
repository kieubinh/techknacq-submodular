        "Reordering plays a crucial role in phrase-based translation (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004).",
        "While local reordering can be directly memorized in phrases, modeling reordering at a phrase level still remains a major challenge: it can be cast as a travelling salesman problem and proves to be NP-complete (Knight, 1999; Zaslavskiy et al., 2009).",
        "The past decade has witnessed the rapid development of phrase reordering models (e.g., (Och et al., 2004; Tillman, 2004; Zens et al., 2004; Xiong et al., 2006; Al-Onaizan and Papineni, 2006; Koehn et al., 2007; Galley and Manning, 2008; Feng et al., 2010; Green et al., 2010; Bisazza and Federico, 2012; Cherry, 2013), just to name a few).",
        "Among them, lexicalized reordering models (Tillman, 2004; Koehn et al., 2007; Galley and Manning, 2008) have been widely used in practical phrase-based systems.",
        "Unlike the distance-based reordering model (Koehn et al., 2003) that only penalizes phrase displacements in terms of the degree of nonmonotonicity, lexicalized reordering models introduce reordering probabilities conditioned on the words of each phrase pair.",
        "They often distinguish between three orientations with respect to the previous phrase pair: monotone, swap, and discontinuous.",
        "As lexicalized reordering models capture the phenomenon that some words are far more likely to be displaced than others, they outperform unlexicalized reordering models substantially.",
        "Despite their apparent success in statistical machine translation, lexicalized reordering models suffer from the following three drawbacks: 1.",
        "Context insensitivity.",
        "Lexicalized reordering models determine the orientations only depending on the words of current phrase pairs.",
        "In fact, a phrase pair usually has different orientations in different contexts.",
        "It is important to include more contexts to improve the expressive power of reordering models.",
        "2.",
        "Ambiguity.",
        "Short phrase pairs, which are observed in the training data more frequently, usually have multiple orientations.",
        "We observe that about 92.4% of one-word Chinese-English phrase pairs are ambiguous.",
        "This makes it hard to decide which orientation should be properly used in decoding.",

        "Lexicalized reordering models use fixed probability distributions (e.g., 17.50% for M, 1.59% for S, and 80.92% for D) in decoding even though the surrounding contexts keep changing.",
        "3.",
        "Sparsity.",
        "Lexicalized reordering models maintain a reordering probability distribution for each phrase pair.",
        "As most long phrase pairs that are capable of memorizing local word selection and reordering only occur once in the training data, maximum likelihood estimation can hardly train the models accurately.",
        "In this work, we propose a neural reordering model for phrase-based translation.",
        "The contribution is twofold.",
        "Firstly, unlike conventional lexicalized reordering models, the neural reordering model conditions reordering probabilities on the words of both the current and previous phrase pairs.",
        "Including the words of previous phrase pairs significantly improves context sensitivity and reduces reordering ambiguity.",
        "Secondly, to alleviate the data sparsity problem, we build a neural classifier for all phrase pairs, which are represented as continuous space vectors.",

        "2 Lexicalized Reordering Models The lexicalized reordering models (Tillman, 2004; Koehn et al., 2007; Galley and Manning, 2008) have become the de facto standard in modern phrase-based systems.",
        "These models are called lexicalized because they condition reordering probabilities on the words of each phrase pair.",
        "Depending on the relationship between the current and previous phrase pairs, lexicalized reordering models often define orientations to classify different reordering patterns.",

        "Reordering as classification.",
        "Instead of maintaining a reordering probability distribution for each phrase pair, we build a reordering classifier for all phrase pairs (Xiong et al., 2006; Li et al., 2013).",
        "This significantly reduces data sparsity by considering all occurrences of extracted phrase pairs as training examples.",
        "We find that 500, 000 reordering examples suffice to train a robust classifier (Section 4.5).",
        "2.",
        "Continuous space representation.",
        "Instead of using a symbolic representation of phrases, we use a continuous space representation that treats a phrase as a dense real-valued vector (Socher et al., 2011b; Li et al., 2013).",

        "and -- in Centara Grand?.",
        "It is usually easy to predict the orientations of -- in London?",
        "because it might be observed in the training data for many times.",
        "This is not the case for -- in Centara Grand?",
        "as it might occur only once.",
        "However, if the two phrases happen to have very similar continuous space representations, -- in Centara Grand?",

        "When optimizing the parameters of the softmax layer, the training procedure keeps the parameters of the recursive autoencoders and word embedding matrices fixed.",
        "The corresponding error function is the classification error as described above.",
        "We also use L-BFGS to optimize the parameters and the standard error backpropagation algorithm (Rumelhart et al., 1986) to compute the derivatives.",

        "The orientations can be determined with respect to words (Tillman, 2004), phrases (Koehn et al., 2007), or hierarchical phrases (Galley and Manning, 2008); 3. neural model: conditioning the reordering probabilities on both the current and previous phrase pairs.",
        "For lexicalized and neural models, we further distinguish between two kinds of orientation sets: {monotone, swap, discontinuous} and {left, right}.",
        "The left/right orientations only consider whether the current source phrase is on the left of the previous source phrase or not.",
        "Therefore, swap and discontinuous-left are merged into left while monotone and discontinuous-right into right.",
