        "Class-based n-gram modeling is an effective approach to overcome data sparsity in language model (LM) training.",
        "By grouping words with similar distributional behavior into equivalence classes, class-based LMs have less parameters to train and can make predictions based on longer histories.",
        "This makes them particularly attractive in situations where n-gram coverage is low due to shortage of training data or to specific properties of the language at hand.",
        "While translation into English has drawn most of the research effort in statistical machine translation (SMT) so far, there is now a growing interest in translating into languages that are more challenging for standard n-gram modeling techniques.",
        "Notably, morphologically rich languages are characterized by high type/token ratios (T/T) that reflect in high out-of-vocabulary word rates and frequent backing-off to low order n-gram estimates, even when large amounts of training data are used.",
        "These problems have been long studied in the field of speech recognition but much less in SMT, although the target LM is a core component of all state-of-the-art SMT frameworks.",
        "Partly inspired by successful research in the field of speech recognition, various forms of class-based LMs have been shown to improve the quality of SMT when used in combination with standard word-level LMs.",
        "These approaches, however, have mostly focused on English (Uszkoreit and Brants, 2008; Dyer et al., 2011; Monz, 2011; Hassan et al., 2007; Birch et al., 2007) with only recent exceptions (Green and DeNero, 2012; Ammar et al., 2013; Wuebker et al., 2013; Durrani et al., 2014).",
        "Moreover, there is no published work that systematically evaluates different kinds of classes, model forms and LM combination methods in a unified SMT setting.",
        "On the contrary, most of the existing literature on LM combination uses mixtures of multiple word-level LMs for domain adaptation purposes.",
        "This paper aims to fill these gaps by applying various class-based LM techniques to the challenging problem of translating into a morphologically rich language.",
        "In particular we focus on English-Russian, a language pair for which a fair amount of both parallel data and monolingual data has been provided by the Workshop of Machine Translation (Bojar et al., 2013).",
        "Russian is characterized by a rich inflectional morphology, with a particularly complex nominal declension (six core cases, three genders and two This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "1918 number categories).",
        "This results in complex agreement phenomena and an extremely rich vocabulary.",
        "Indeed, by examining our training data (see Section 4), we find the Russian T/T ratio to be almost two times higher than the English one.",
        "Given this task, we make a number of contributions leading to a better understanding of ways to utilize class-based language models for translating into morphologically rich languages.",
        "We conduct a comparative evaluation of different target LMs along the following axes: (1) Classes: data-driven versus shallow morphology-based; (2) Model forms: simple class sequence (stream-based) versus original class-based (Brown et al., 1992); and (3) Combination frameworks: model-level log-linear combination versus word-level linear interpolation.",
        "When comparing the different model forms we pay particular attention to the role word emission probabilities play in class-based models, which turns out to be a significant factor for translating into morphologically rich languages.",
        "In this context we also evaluate for the first time a specific form of class-based LM called fullibm (Goodman, 2001) within statistical MT.",
        "2 Class-based language models As introduced by (Brown et al., 1992), the idea of class-based n-gram language modeling is to group words with similar distributional behavior into equivalence classes.",
        "The word transition probability is then decomposed into a class transition probability and a word emission probability: P class (w i |w i?1 i?n+1 ) = p 0 (C(w i )|C(w i?1 i?n+1 )) ?",
        "p 1 (w i |C(w i )) (1) This results in models that are more compact and more robust to data sparsity.",
        "Often, in the context of SMT, the word emission probability is dropped and only the class sequence is modeled.",
        "In this work, we refer to this model form as stream-based n-gram LM: 1 P stream (w i |w i?1 i?n+1 ) = p 0 (C(w i )|C(w i?1 i?n+1 )) (2) Stream-based LMs are used, for instance, in factored SMT (Koehn et al., 2007), and in general many of the ?class-based LMs?",
        "mentioned in the SMT literature are actually of the latter form (2) (Dyer et al., 2011; Green and DeNero, 2012; Ammar et al., 2013; Chahuneau et al., 2013; Wuebker et al., 2013; Durrani et al., 2014).",
        "One exception is the work of Uszkoreit and Brants (2008), who incorporate word emission probabilities in their class-based LM used as an additional feature function in the log-linear combination (cf.",
        "Section 3.1).",
        "Interestingly, we are not aware of work that compares actual class-based LMs and stream-based LMs with respect to SMT quality.",
        "While class-based LMs are known to be effective at counteracting data sparsity issues due to rich vocabularies, it is worth noting that they adhere to the fundamental constraints of n-gram modeling.",
        "Thus, grammatical agreement may be improved by a class-based LM approach only within a limited context window.",
        "Previous work that attempted to overcome this limitation includes (i) syntactic LMs for n-best reranking (Hasan et al., 2006; Carter and Monz, 2011) or integrated into decoding with significant engineering challenges (Galley and Manning, 2009; Schwartz et al., 2011) and (ii) unification-based constraints applied to a syntax-based SMT framework (Williams and Koehn, 2011).",
        "We will now describe different kinds of word-to-class mapping functions used by class-based LMs.",
        "These can be completely data-driven or based on different sorts of linguistic or orthographic features.",
        "2.1 Data-driven classes The most popular form of class-based LMs was introduced by (Brown et al., 1992).",
        "In this approach, the corpus vocabulary is partitioned into a preset number of clusters by directly maximizing the likelihood of a training corpus.",
        "No linguistic or orthographic features are taken into account while training the classes.",
        "2 Later work has focused on decreasing the large computational cost of the exchange algorithm proposed by Brown et al. (1992), either with a distributed algorithm (Uszkoreit and Brants, 2008) or by using a whole-context distributional vector space model (Sch?utze and Walsh, 2011).",
        "In this paper we use the standard SRILM implementation of Brown clustering.",
        "1 Not to be confused with the incrementally trainable stream-based LMs of Levenberg and Osborne (2009).",
        "2 Och (1999) extends a similar approach to bilingual clustering with the aim of generalizing the applicability of translation rules in an alignment template SMT framework.",
        "1919 2.2 Linguistic classes Linguistic knowledge is another way to establish word equivalence classes.",
        "Common examples include lemma, part of speech and morphology-based classes, each of which can capture different aspects of the word sequence, such as the relative order of syntactic constituents or grammatical agreement.",
        "Hassan et al. (2007) and Birch et al. (2007) went as far as scoring n-grams of Combinatorial Categorial Grammar supertags.",
        "When using linguistic classes, one has to deal with the fact that the same word can belong to different classes when used in different contexts.",
        "Solutions to this problem include tagging the target word sequence as it is generated (Koehn et al., 2007; Birch et al., 2007; Green and DeNero, 2012), choosing the most probable class sequence for each phrase pair (Monz, 2011) or?even more lightweight?choosing the most probable class for each word (Bisazza and Federico, 2012).",
        "Alternatively, simpler deterministic class mappings can be derived by using shallow linguistic knowl-edge, such as suffixes or orthographic features.",
        "The former can be obtained with a rule-based stemmer (as in this work), or, even more simply, by selecting the ?",
        "most common word suffixes in a training corpus and then mapping each word to its longest matching suffix (M?uller et al., 2012).",
        "Orthographic features may include capitalization information or the presence of digits, punctuation or other special characters (M?uller et al., 2012).",
        "2.3 Hybrid surface/class models M?uller et al. (2012) obtain the best perplexity reduction when excluding frequent words from the class mapping.",
        "That is, each word with more than ?",
        "occurrences in the training corpus is assigned to a singleton class with word emission probability equal to 1.",
        "The frequency threshold ?",
        "is determined with a grid search on a monolingual held-out set.",
        "Optimal values for perplexities are shown to vary considerably among languages.",
        "In this work we follow this setup closely.",
        "It is worth noting that Bisazza and Federico (2012) have applied a similar idea to the problem of style adaptation: they train a hybrid POS/word n-gram LM on an in-domain corpus and use it as an additional SMT feature function with the goal of counterbalancing the bias towards the style of the large out-of-domain data.",
        "The idea of modeling sequences of mixed granularity (word/subword) was earlier introduced to speech recognition by Yazgan and Sarac?lar (2004).",
        "The most extensive comparison of distributional, morphological and hybrid classes that we are aware of is the work by M?uller et al. (2012), but that does not include any SMT evaluation.",
        "Looking at perplexity results over a large number of European language pairs (not including Russian), M?uller et al. (2012) conclude that a hybrid suffix/word class-based LM simply built on frequency-based suffixes performs as well as a model trained on much more expensive distributional classes.",
        "Motivated by this finding, we evaluate these two kinds of classes in the context of SMT into a morphologically rich language.",
        "2.4 Fullibm language model As outlined above, the class-based LMs generally used in SMT are in fact stream-based models in the sense that they only estimate the probability of the class sequence (see Equation 2).",
        "However, the classic form of class-based LM (Brown et al., 1992) also includes a class-to-word emission probability p 1 (w i |C(w i )) whose utility has not been properly assessed in the context of SMT.",
        "Besides, we observe that a variety of class-based LM variants have been studied in speech recognition but not in SMT.",
        "In particular, Goodman (2001) presents a generalization of the standard class-based form where the word emission is also conditioned on the class history rather than on the current class alone.",
        "The resulting model is called fullibm: P fullibm (w i |w i?1 i?n+1 ) = p 0 (C(w i )|C(w i?1 i?n+1 )) ?",
        "p 1 (w i |C(w i i?n+1 )) (3) We expect this model to yield more refined, context-sensitive word emission distributions which may result in better target LM probabilities for our SMT system.",
        "1920 3 SMT combining framework Class-based LMs are rarely used in isolation, but are rather combined with standard word-level models.",
        "There exist at least two ways to combine multiple LMs into a log-linear SMT decoder: (i) as separate feature functions in the global log-linear combination or (ii) as components of a linear mixture counting as a single feature function in the global combination.",
        "3.1 Log-linear combination The standard log-linear approach to SMT allows for the combination of m arbitrary model components (or feature functions), each weighted by a corresponding weight ?",
        "m : p(x|h) = ?",
        "m p m (x|h) ?",
        "m (4) In typical SMT settings, p m (x|h) are phrase-or word-level translation probabilities, reordering prob-abilities, and so on.",
        "Treating the new LM as an additional feature function has the advantage that its weight can be directly optimized for SMT quality together with all other feature weights, using standard parameter tuning techniques (Och, 2003; Hopkins and May, 2011).",
        "3.2 Linear interpolation The other widely used combining framework is linear interpolation or mixture model: p(x|h) = ?",
        "q ?",
        "q p q (x|h) (5) More specifically, word LMs are usually interpolated as a word-level weighted average of the n-gram probabilities: p mixLM (e) = n ?",
        "i=1 ( ?",
        "q ?",
        "q p q (e i |h i ) ) (6) The drawback of this approach is that the linear interpolation weights, or lambdas, cannot be set with standard SMT tuning techniques.",
        "Instead, interpolation weights are typically determined by maximizing the likelihood of a held-out monolingual data set, but this does not always outperform simple uniform weighting in terms of translation quality.",
        "3 Despite the lambda optimization issue, linear interpolation with uniform or maximum-likelihood weights has been shown to work better for SMT than log-linear combination when combining regular word n-gram LMs (Foster and Kuhn, 2007).",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge, the linear interpolation of word- and class-based LMs has never been tested in SMT.",
        "In their intrinsic evaluation, M?uller et al. (2012) show that linear mixing with hybrid class/surface models of various kinds consistently decrease the perplexity of a Kneser-Ney smoothed word-level LM, with relative improvements ranging between 3% (English) and 11% (Finnish).",
        "All their models are interpolated with class-specific lambda weights, according to the following formula: P mix (w i |w i?1 i?n+1 ) = ?",
        "C(w i?1 ) ?",
        "P class (w i |w i?1 i?n+1 ) + (1?",
        "?",
        "C(w i?1 ) ) ?",
        "P word (w i |w i?1 i?n+1 ) (7) where P word corresponds to the standard n-gram model using the lexical forms.",
        "Equation 7 can be seen as a generalization of the simple interpolation ?P class + (1 ?",
        "?",
        ")P word used by Brown et al. (1992).",
        "The class-specific lambdas are estimated by a deleted interpolation algorithm (Bahl et al., 1991).",
        "In our experiments, we test both generic and class-specific lambda interpolation for SMT.",

        "By measuring the type/token ratios of the two sides of a parallel corpus, we can estimate the difference in morphological complexity between two languages: as shown in Table 1, the Russian T/T is almost two times higher than the English one (.0204 vs .0107) in the WMT13 parallel training data.",

        "The weights of the individual PRO runs are then averaged and passed on to the next decoding iteration.",
        "Performing weight estimation independently for a number of samples corrects for some of the instability that can be caused by individual samples.",

        "When translating into a morphologically rich language, such as Russian, the role of the target language model is two-fold.",
        "On the one hand, it helps choose the correct meaning from the available phrase translation candidates, on the other hand, it helps choose the correct surface realization of the translation candidate that agrees grammatically with the previous target context.",
        "For morphologically rich languages the second aspect plays a considerably larger role than for morphologically poor languages.",
        "To disentangle these two roles of the language model we also evaluated the different language models with respect to stem-based information only, stripping off any inflectional information using the Snowball stemmer.",
        "These results are also reported in Table 3 and in general exhibit the same trend as the surface-based BLEU scores.",
        "Again, fullibm performs best, and the original class-based LMs do not lead to any improvements over the baseline.",

        "1924 guage models may be linearly interpolated with weights determined by maximizing the likelihood of a held-out monolingual data set (see Section 3.2).",
        "While linear interpolation often outperforms log-linear interpolation for combining language models for domain adaptation (Foster and Kuhn, 2007), this does not seem to be the case for language models for morphologically rich target languages.",
        "The results presented in Table 4 consistently show that linear interpolation under-performs log-linear combination under all conditions.",
        "Even using class-specific interpolation weights as suggested by M?uller et al. (2012) did not lead to any further improvements.",
        "5 Conclusion We have presented the first systematic comparison of different forms of class-based LMs and different class LM combination methods in the context of SMT into a morphologically rich language.",
        "First of all, our results have shown that careful modeling of class-to-word emission probabilities?",
        "often omitted from the models used in SMT -- is actually important for improving translation quality.",
        "In particular, we have achieved best results when using a refined variant of the original class-based LM, called fullibm, which had never been tested for SMT but only for speech recognition (Goodman, 2001).",
        "Secondly, we have found that a rather simple LM based on shallow morphology-based classes can get close, in terms of BLEU, to the performance of more computationally expensive data-driven classes.",
        "Although the reported improvements are modest, they are statistically significant and obtained in a competitive large-data scenario against a state-of-the-art baseline.",
        "On the downside, and somewhat in contrast with previous findings in domain adaptation, we have observed that linear interpolation of word- and class-based LMs with perplexity-tuned weights performs worse than the log-linear combination of models with model-level weights globally tuned for translation quality.",
        "This result was confirmed also when using class-specific lambdas as suggested by M?uller et al. (2012).",
        "Indeed, modeling morphologically rich languages remains a challenging problem for SMT but, with our evaluation, we have contributed to assess how far existing language modeling techniques may go in this direction.",
        "Natural extensions of this work include combining multiple LMs based on different, and possibly complementary, kinds of classes such as data-driven and suffix-based, or using supervised morphological analyzers instead of a simple stemmer.",
        "In a broader perspective, we believe that future research should question the fundamental constraints of n-gram modeling and develop innovative modeling techniques that conform to the specific requirements of translating into morphologically rich languages.",
