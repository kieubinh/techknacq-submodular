        "and related work Native Language Identification (NLI) is the task of identifying the native language of a writer by analyzing texts written by this writer in a non-native language.",
        "NLI started to attract attention in computational linguistics with the work of Koppel et al. (2005).",
        "Since then, the interest has increased steadily, leading to the First NLI Shared Task in 2013, with 29 participating teams (Tetreault et al., 2013).",
        "The task of NLI is usually treated as a text classification problem with the L1s as classes.",
        "A wide range of features, reaching from character or word-based n-grams to different types of syntactic models have been employed in NLI.",
        "For example, Wong and Dras (2011) utilized character and part-of-speech (POS) n-grams as well as cross-sections of parse trees and Context-Free Grammar (CFG) features, i.e., local trees.",
        "Their approach with a binary representation of non-lexicalized rules (except for those rules lexicalized with function words and punctuation) outperformed a setup using only lexical features, such as n-grams, on data from the International Corpus of Learner English (ICLE; Granger et al., 2002).",
        "Swanson and Charniak (2012) used binary feature representations of CFG and Tree Substitution Grammar (TSG) rules replacing terminals (except for function words) by a special symbol.",
        "TSG outperformed CFG features in their settings.",
        "Among several options, Brooke and Hirst (2012) explored using non-lexicalized CFG production rules in a binary feature encoding on three corpora: ICLE, FCE (Yannakoudakis et al., 2011), and Lang-8 (Brooke and Hirst, 2013a).",
        "The authors conclude that including CFG features generally boosts the performance of the system.",
        "In the context of the First NLI Shared Task, in Bykh et al. (2013) we showed that non-lexicalized frequency-based CFG features contribute relevant information.",
        "Other recent work has focused on TSGs (Tetreault et al., 2012; Brooke and Hirst, 2013b; Swanson and Charniak, 2012; Swanson and Charniak, 2013; Swanson, 2013; Malmasi et al., 2013).",
        "Before extending syntactic modeling further, in this paper we want to systematically explore the range of options involving CFG rule features for NLI.",
        "We consider non-lexicalized and lexicalized CFG fea-tures, and different feature representations, from binary encodings to a normalized frequency encoding inspired by a variationist sociolinguistic perspective.",
        "Previous research in this domain often limited the use of lexicalized rules given that the lexicalization may lead to an unintended topic or domain dependence.",
        "Yet, NLI research has since established that lexical features, such as word-based n-grams, are among the best performing features both in single-This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.",

        "At the same time, the question whether an NLI approach and its results capture general characteristics of language and language learning instead of only encoding the characteristics of a specific data set remains an essential concern.",
        "In the experiments in this paper, we thus include experiments on both a topic-balanced single-corpus and on a highly heterogeneous cross-corpus data set.",
        "The range of feature types used in NLI research raises a further question, namely how the different sources of information are best combined.",
        "The most simple solution is to put all features into a single vector.",
        "However, Tetreault et al. (2012) pointed out that the performance can be increased by using a probability-estimate based ensemble (meta-classifier), which was confirmed in Bykh et al. (2013) and Cimino et al. (2013).",
        "But which models are worth integrating into such a meta-classifier?",
        "Some of the models may be redundant despite performing well individually; on the other hand, some models may improve the ensemble despite performing relatively poorly by itself.",
        "We explore this issue by implementing a basic ensemble optimization algorithm performing model selection.",
        "In terms of the structure of the paper, in section 2 we first introduce the corpora used in the single-corpus and cross-corpus settings.",
        "Section 3 then presents the first set of experiments, systematically exploring lexicalized and unlexicalized Context-Free Grammar Rules (CFGR) as features.",
        "Given the significant complexity of the overall feature space, we then explore model selection for optimizing the ensemble classifier in section 4.",
        "In section 5, we combine the CFGR features with n-grams, resulting in the best accuracy reported for the standard TOEFL11 test set.",
        "Section 6 sums up the paper and sketches some directions for future research.",
        "2 Data The research in this paper makes use of two sets of data: First, there is the TOEFL11 (T11) data set (Blanchard et al., 2013), which was introduced for the NLI Shared Task 2013 and has become a standard frame of reference for NLI research.",
        "We use this standard setup for single-corpus evaluation, where each L1 is represented by 1100 essays, of which 100 essays are singled out in the standard test set.",
        "The remaining 1000 essays per L1 (= T11 train ?",
        "dev) constitute our training data in the single-corpus settings.",
        "Second, we make use of a range of other learner corpora to study how well the results generalize.",
        "Concretely, for our cross-corpus settings we employ the NT11 corpus of Bykh et al. (2013), which consists of the ICLE (Granger et al., 2009), FCE (Yannakoudakis et al., 2011), BALC (Randall and Groom, 2009), ICNALE (Ishikawa, 2011), and T ?",
        "UTEL-NLI (Bykh et al., 2013) corpora.",
        "In total NT11 includes 5843 texts, with the following division into languages: Arabic (846), Chinese (1048), French (456), German (500), Hindu (400), Italian (467), Japanese (447), Korean (684), Spanish (446), Telugu (200), Turkish (349).",
        "In the cross-corpus settings, we train on NT11 and test on the standard T11 test set.",
        "3 Systematically exploring Context-Free Grammar Rules (CFGR) 3.1 Features In this paper, we focus on the CFG production rules (CFGR) as syntactic features for the task of NLI.",
        "CFG rules are the most basic and widely used local syntactic units modularizing the overall syntactic analysis of a sentence.",
        "We parsed the T11 and NT11 corpora using the Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2002) and extracted all CFG rules from the T11 and NT11 training sets.",
        "On this basis we defined the following tree feature types: 1.",

        "Complementing these standard feature representations, we explored two options that take as starting point the observation that CFG rules with the same left-hand side category represent different ways to rewrite that category.",
        "So in a sense, under a top-down perspective, there is a choice between different ways of realizing a given category.",
        "This is reminiscent of variationist sociolinguistic analysis, where one studies the linguistic choices made by a given speaker and connects the choices with extra-linguistic variables such as the age or gender of a speaker.",
        "For example, in William Labov's field-defining study ?The Social Stratification of (r) in New York City Department Stores?",
        "from his book ?Sociolinguistic Patterns?",
        "(Labov, 1972), he found that the presence or absence of the consonant [r] in postvocalic position (e.g., car, fourth) correlates with the ranking of people in status or prestige, i.e., social stratification.",
        "Speakers thus make choices in how to realize a given variable by producing one of the variants (see also Tagliamonte, 2011).",
        "Inspired by this perspective, in Meurers et al. (2013) we discussed how a variationist perspective on syntactic alternations can provide interpretable features for NLI classification.",
        "Under a variationist perspective, producing one of the variants of a given variable also means not choosing the other variants of that variable.",
        "So it is this grouping of observations that we want to take into account in terms of encoding local trees as features when we interpret the mother category as the variable to be realized and the different CFG rules with that left-hand side as variants of that variable.",
        "This results in two feature representations, a simple one (var s ) and a weighted one (var w ).",
        "The var s and var w frequency normalizations for each variant v from the set of variants V realizing a particular variable out of the set of variables V is defined as follows: var s (v ?",

        "V ) = F (V ) n ?",
        "i=1 F (V i ) The weighting applied in var w takes into account the frequency proportion of each variable V in the overall variables set V , assigning higher weights for more frequent variables.",
        "Mathematically it reduces to normalizing each variant by the sum of the frequencies over all variants across all variables, i.e., to the relative frequency of each variant v with respect to the set of all variables V .",

        "To obtain results for all feature representations which are comparable across the different settings we uniformly scale all values employing the -Z option of WEKA.",
        "This means that the freq feature representation based on the raw frequencies in essence also becomes normalized.",
        "This is particularly relevant in the context of the cross-corpus evaluation, where raw frequencies are particularly questionable given highly variable text sizes.",

        "In contrast to previous research assuming that lexicalized trees are too topic-specific, the results show that CFGR lex is a valuable feature type in both the single-corpus and the cross-corpus settings.",
        "The CFGR lex features combine syntactic and lexical information, such as the fact that a given token with a particular POS is used, e.g., the token can being used as a noun in There is a can of beer in the fridge instead of as the more frequent modal verb use in He can dance.",
        "Note that this is different from using word and POS unigrams as features, where the relevant connection is lost.",
        "In both the T11 data, which is topic balanced, for single-corpus evaluation and the very heterogeneous NT11 data containing a wide range of topics for cross-corpus evaluation, we obtained consistently better results for CFGR lex than for CFGR ph .",

        "freq also consistently performs worse than var s in the cross-corpus setting, despite outperforming var s single-corpus.",
        "1965 Using binary features (bin) yields better results cross-corpus than freq, whereas in the single-corpus setting it is the other way round.",
        "The abstraction introduced by the binary feature representation thus shows a positive effect in terms of the capability of the features to generalize to other data sets.",
        "For the abstract CFGR ph features, var s performs better than freq or bin in the cross-corpus setting.",
        "The fact that the var w is performing consistently better than var s shows that weighting is important.",
        "Hence, incorporating the insight from variationist sociolinguistics is not only conceptually interesting as a theoretical perspective, but also provides a quantitative advantage in terms of performance.",
        "CFGR categories as variables As mentioned above, the best performance is achieved by combining CFGR ph and CFGR lex into the CFGR ph?lex feature type using the weighted variationist feature representation var w .",
        "Thus, we focused on that feature type and explored it more in depth.",
        "We did so by splitting the overall var w normalized CFGR ph?lex feature set by the variable, i.e., the different mother nodes.",
        "We trained separate models, where each of those models consists of features encoding the different variants, i.e., the different realizations in which a given mother node can be rewritten.",
