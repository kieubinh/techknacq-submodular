        "Text simplification has often been defined as the process of reducing the grammatical and lexical complexity of a text, while still retaining the original information content and meaning.",
        "However, text can also be simplified in other ways; for instance, by removing peripheral information to reduce text length, through sentence compression or summarisation.",
        "A key goal of automatic text simplification is to make information more accessible to the large numbers of people with reduced literacy, motivated by a large body of evidence that manual text simplification is an effective intervention (Anderson and Freebody, 1981; L?Allier, 1980; Beck et al., 1991; Anderson and Davison, 1988; Linderholm et al., 2000; Kamalski et al., 2008).",
        "However automatic text simplification systems have rarely been evaluated in a manner that sheds light on whether they can facilitate target users.",
        "To date, evaluations of automatic text simplification have been (a) performed on a small scale, as few as 20?25 sentences in some cases (Wubben et al., 2012; Siddharthan and Mandya, 2014; Narayan and Gardent, 2014), (b) performed on sentences in isolation, thus not measuring incoherence caused at the inter-sentential level that can make text more difficult (Siddharthan (2003a) being the exception), and (c) performed using either automatic metrics (Zhu et al., 2010; Coster and Kauchak, 2011; Woodsend and Lapata, 2011; Wubben et al., 2012; Paetzold and Specia, 2013) or using ratings by fluent readers for fluency, simplicity and meaning preservation (Siddharthan, 2006; Woodsend and Lapata, 2011; Wubben et al., 2012; Paetzold and Specia, 2013; Siddharthan and Mandya, 2014; Narayan and Gardent, 2014; Mandya and Siddharthan, 2014).",
        "As such, none of these evaluations can help us answer the basic question: How good is automatic text simplification; i.e., would it facilitate poor readers?",
        "Our goals in this paper are twofold.",
        "First, we want to evaluate text simplification systems more systematically than has been attempted before, using both human judgements on a larger scale, and directly testing comprehension on longer passages for target reader populations.",
        "Second, we want to compare two different approaches to text simplification.",
        "In this paper, we present a text simplification system that can perform lexical and syntactic simplification (?3), as well as a novel sentence compression system designed specifically for the text simplification task (?4), in that it favours compressions with fewer difficult words and with more function words such as connectives that are known to improve readability.",
        "We evaluate both, as well as a hybrid system that performs both text simplification and compression (?5, 6).",
        "1996 2 Related Work Text simplification systems differ primarily in the level of linguistic knowledge they encode.",
        "Phrase Based Machine Translation (PBMT) systems (Specia, 2010; Wubben et al., 2012; Coster and Kauchak, 2011) use the least knowledge, and as such are ill equipped to handle simplifications that require morphological changes, syntactic reordering, sentence splitting or insertions.",
        "While syntax based MT approaches use syntactic knowledge, existing systems do not offer a treatment of morphology (Zhu et al., 2010; Woodsend and Lapata, 2011; Paetzold and Specia, 2013).",
        "This means that while some syntactic reordering operations can be performed well, others requiring morphological changes cannot.",
        "Consider converting passive to active voice (e.g., from ?trains are liked by John?",
        "to ?John likes trains?).",
        "Besides deleting auxiliaries and reordering the arguments of the verb, there is also a requirement to modify the verb to make it agree in number with the new subject ?John?, and take the tense of the auxiliary ?are?.",
        "Hand crafted systems such as Siddharthan (2010) and Siddharthan (2011) use transformation rules that encode morphological changes as well as deletions, re-orderings, substitutions and sentence splitting, and can handle voice change correctly.",
        "However, hand crafted systems are limited in scope to syntactic simplification as there are too many lexico-syntactic and lexical simplifications to enumerate manually.",
        "Some contemporary work in text simplification has evolved from research in sentence compression, a related research area that aims to shorten sentences for the purpose of summarising the main content.",
        "Sentence compression has historically been addressed in a generative framework, where transformation rules are learnt from parsed corpora of sentences aligned with manually compressed versions, using ideas adapted from statistical machine translation.",
        "The compression rules learnt are typically syntactic tree-to-tree transformations (Knight and Marcu, 2000; Galley and McKeown, 2007; Riezler et al., 2003; Cohn and Lapata, 2009; Nomoto, 2008) of some variety.",
        "Indeed, Woodsend and Lapata (2011) develop this line of research.",
        "Their model is based on quasi-synchronous tree substitution grammar (QTSG) (Smith and Eisner, 2006) and integer linear programming.",
        "Quasi-synchronous grammars aim to relax the isomorphism constraints of synchronous grammars, in this case by generating a loose alignment between parse trees.",
        "Woodsend and Lapata (2011) use QTSG to generate all possible rewrite operations for a source tree, and then integer linear programming to select the most appropriate simplification.",
        "Their system performs lexical and syntactic simplification as well as compression.",
        "Recently, there have been attempts to combine approaches.",
        "Narayan and Gardent (2014) use an approach based on semantics to perform syntactic simplification, and PBMT for lexical simplifications.",
        "We have also created a hybrid system, but one using linguistically sound hand written rules for syntactic simplification and automatically acquired rules for lexicalised constructs (Siddharthan and Mandya, 2014; Mandya and Siddharthan, 2014).",
        "In this paper we combine this work (summarised in ?3) with a new method for sentence compression (described in ?4).",
        "3 Text Simplification with Synchronous Dependency Grammars We use the RegenT text simplification (Siddharthan, 2011), augmented with automatically acquired rules, as described in detail elsewhere (Mandya and Siddharthan, 2014; Siddharthan and Mandya, 2014).",
        "In this section, we will restrict ourselves to summarising the key features of the system.",
        "Our text simplification system follows the architecture proposed in Ding and Palmer (2005) for Synchronous Dependency Insertion Grammars, reproduced in Fig. 1.",
        "It uses the same dataset 1 as Woodsend and Lapata (2011) for learning lexicalised rules.",
        "The rules are acquired in the format required by the RegenT text simplification system (Siddharthan, 2011), which is used to implement the simplification.",

        "In short, we extract a synchronous grammar from dependency parses of aligned English and simple English sentences, starting from the differences in the parses.",
        "For example, consider two aligned sentences from the aligned corpus described in Woodsend and Lapata (2011): 1.",
        "(a) It was the second most intensive storm on the planet in 1989.",
        "(b) It was the second strongest storm on the planet in 1989.",
        "An automatic comparison of the dependency parses for the two sentences reveals that there are two typed dependencies that occur only in the parse of the first sentence, and one that occurs only in the parse of the second.",
        "Thus, to convert the first sentence into the second, two dependencies need to be deleted and one inserted.",
        "From this example, the rule shown in Fig. 2 is extracted.",
        "The rule contains variables (?Xn), which can be forced to match certain words in square brackets.",
        "Such deletion and insertion operations are central to text simplification, but a few other operations are also needed to handle morphology and to avoid broken dependency links in the Target ETs.",
        "These are enumerated in (Siddharthan, 2011).",
        "By collecting such rules, a meta-grammar is produced that can translate dependency parses in one language (English) into the other (simplified English).",
        "The rule above will translate ?most intensive?",
        "to ?strongest?, in the immediate lexical context of ?storm?.",
        "The ET Transfer component can be presented either as transformation rules or as a transduction of ETs, as shown in Fig. 2.",
        "In Mandya and Siddharthan (2014), we describe how such automatically acquired rules can be generalised to apply in new contexts; for instance, by expanding lexical context to include related words derived from WordNet, or by removing the lexical context for lexical simplifications that are not context dependent.",

        "to ?Coulter has called herself a polemicist?.",
        "Our text simplification system, as evaluated in this paper, combines a set of 278 hand crafted grammar for syntactic simplification (from the original RegenT system) and 5172 automatically acquired rules, based on the principles described above.",

        "We will explain later where the word ?reluctant?",
        "comes from.",
        "Broadly, RT comes in two parts: generation and selection.",
        "For a given sentence it takes as input, it generates a number of 1998 detention 2009 of hikers American by Iran Figure 3: Dependency structure for ?2009 detention of American hikers by Iran?",
        "detention 2009 ofhikers American by Iran C1 C2C3 Figure 4: Cropping dependency tree truncations of the sentence, each of which has some elements removed in a way that largely complies with English syntax.",
        "It does this by first parsing the sentence into a a dependency representation, and creating what we call terminating dependency paths out of the representation.",
        "After placing them in a lattice format, we run a K-best search over the lattice to generate K best truncations of the sentence.",
        "We repeat the process for each sentence found in the text, which will produce a collection of sets of truncation candidates.",
        "We then run integer linear programming over the collection, selecting one sentence for each set in a way that satisfies global constraints such as lexical density, the ratio of hard words, and text length.",
        "In particular, we regard RT not as an operation that works sentence by sentence, but one that works with text as a whole.",
        "We argue that how the sentence is to be compressed is not only dictated by the sentence itself, but also by the text in which it appears.",
        "We start off with an example shown in Figure 3, where we have a phrase ?2009 detention of American hikers by Iran.?",
        "Our goal here is to develop a systematic method that will prune the dependency tree so as to generate shorter versions of the sentence largely in compliance with the English grammar.",
        "Figure 4 provides an intuitive picture of how this could be done: by cropping the tree along the arrows.",
        "We implement the idea by borrowing the notion of Terminating Dependency Path (TDP) (Nomoto, 2008), which gives us a way to translate a dependency tree into a trellis of nodes, which in turn allows us to find truncations through dynamic programming.",
        "Figure 5 shows a TDP lattice derived from the dependency tree given in Figure 3.",
        "TDPs are depicted as solid blue lines in the figure.",
        "It is easy to see that each TDP corresponds to a path in the dependency tree that runs from a leaf to the root.",
        "The conversion from dependency tree to TDP lattice is thus straightforward.",
