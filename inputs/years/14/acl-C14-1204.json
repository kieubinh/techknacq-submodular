        "An event is a specific occurrence involving arguments (participants and attributes) of the specific roles.",
        "In an event, trigger is the main word which most clearly expresses its occurrence, so recognizing an event can be recast as identifying a corresponding trigger.",
        "An event may have several arguments, which are entity mentions (e.g., person name, time, location, etc.)",
        "and must fulfill the corresponding roles.",
        "Take the following sentence as an example: S1: On the 25th Dec. (A1: Artifact), peacekeepers (A2: Artifact) returned (E1: Transport) to Amman (A3: Place) by flight (A4: Vehicle).",
        "For this example, an event extraction system should identify one event mention E1, which is triggered by verb ?returned?",
        "whose event type is Transport, with four arguments, ?peacekeepers?, ?25th Dec.?, ?flight?, and ?Amman?, fulfilling the roles of Artifact, Time, Vehicle, and Place, respectively.",
        "Automatically extracting events from free texts is a higher-level Information Extraction (IE) task, which is still a challenge due to the complexity of natural language and the domain-specific nature, especially in Chinese for its specific characteristics.",
        "In particular, most of previous studies have focused on English event extraction, while only a few concern Chinese.",
        "Currently, supervised learning models have dominated event extraction.",
        "To reduce the labeled data required, a few semi-supervised models have been applied to English event extraction (e.g., Riloff 1996; Yangarber et al., 2000; Stevenson and Greenwood, 2005; Huang and Riloff, 2012).",
        "Since classifier-based model needs dozens of annotated documents to train model, most of previous semi-supervised models focused on pattern-based approach, which only needed a few seed (event) patterns.",
        "In those pattern-based approaches, frequent event patterns, which occur in many documents, were chosen as relevant patterns to match event mentions in unlabeled texts.",
        "However, the order of words in a Chinese sentence is rather agile for its open and flexible structure, and different orders might express the same meaning due to the semantics-driven nature of the Chinese language.",
        "This results in the diversity of Chinese event patterns and numerous infrequent patterns, even some event mentions having no matching patterns.",
        "Hence, it is an issue to extract the event mentions with infrequent patterns.",
        ".",
        "2161 In this paper, we first implement a pattern-based semi-supervised model for Chinese event extraction as a baseline, following the state-of-the-art system as described in (Liao and Grishman, 2010a) and then refine this model to suit Chinese event extraction.",
        "Moreover, we propose various kinds of novel linguistic knowledge-driven event inference mechanisms to address the above issue and recover missing event mentions.",
        "These event inference mechanisms can capture the linguistic knowledge from semantics of argument role, compositional semantics of trigger, consistency on coreference events and relevant events.",
        "Evaluation on the ACE 2005 Chinese corpus shows that our event inference mechanisms dramatically outperform the baseline.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 overviews related work.",
        "Section 3 presents the refined semi-supervised model for Chinese event extraction.",
        "Section 4 proposes several linguistic knowledge-driven event inference mechanisms.",
        "Section 5 reports and analyzes the experimental results.",
        "Finally, we conclude our work in Section 6.",
        "2 Related Work Almost all previous semi-supervised models focus on English event extraction, which can be subdivided into pattern-based models (e.g., Riloff, 1996; Yangrber et al., 2000; Liao and Grishman, 2010a; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2011; Balasubramanian et al., 2013) and classifier-based models (e.g., Chieu et al., 2003; Maslennikov and Chua, 2007; Patwardhan and Riloff, 2009; Liu and Strzalkowski, 2012; Wang et al., 2013).",
        "Classifier-based models normally require a small set of annotated data (e.g., 100 annotated documents), while pattern-based models need dozens of high quality seed patterns.",
        "Riloff (1996) first divided unlabeled documents into irrelevant and relevant documents, and the latter was much likely to contain further relevant patterns.",
        "Then event patterns from relevant documents were generated by using an annotated data and a set of heuristic rules.",
        "Yangarber et al. (2000) proposed a document-centric view to boost a semi-supervised event extraction system, which assumes relevant documents always contain some shared patterns.",
        "Yangarber (2003) further introduced multiple learners into the bootstrapping procedure to make the final decision on the combination of multiple learners on distinct event types.",
        "Huang and Riloff (2012) employed role-identifying nouns, which proposed by Phillips and Riloff (2007), as seed terms to extract patterns from relevant documents and then generated the labeled instances to train three classifiers in their event extraction system.",
        "As an alternative, Stevenson and Greenwood (2005) proposed a pattern similarity-centric view and selected relevant patterns on similarity scores.",
        "Normally, bootstrapping on the document-centric view tends to accept the irrelevant patterns with a high occurrence frequency in relevant documents.",
        "To address this problem, Liao and Grishman (2010a) introduced a pattern similarity metric into the document-centric view as a filter to eliminate those irrelevant patterns.",
        "Liao and Grishman (2011) further applied an information retrieval mechanism to detect relevant documents and proposed a self-training strategy for bootstrapping.",
        "In addition, several studies focused on the event pattern representation, such as pairwise (e.g., Sub-ject-Verb, Verb-Object) (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008, 2009), SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) (Yangarber, 2000; Balasubramanian et al., 2013), chain (Sudo et al., 2001), subtree (Sudo et al., 2003) and complex pattern (Liu and Strzalkowski, 2012).",
        "In the literature, only one paper concerns semi-supervised Chinese event extraction.",
        "Chen and Ji (2009a) applied various kinds of cross-lingual features in the bootstrapping procedure to extract Chinese event.",
        "With the help of over 500 annotated seed event mentions in 100 documents, they only achieved 35% in F1-score.",
        "This indicates the critical challenge in semi-supervised Chinese event extraction.",
        "Only a few studies concern event inference mechanisms.",
        "Ji and Grishman (2008) employed a rule-based approach to propagate consistent triggers and arguments across topic-related documents.",
        "Liao and Grishman (2010b) employed cross-event consistent information to improve sentence-level event extraction.",
        "Hong et al. (2011) regarded entity type consistency as a key feature to predict event mentions and adopted an information retrieval mechanism to promote event extraction.",
        "Li et al. (2013) proposed a global argument inference model on Chinese argument extraction to explore specific relationships among relevant event mentions to recover those inter-sentence arguments in the sentence, discourse and document layers.",
        "Li et al. (2014) also introduced Markov Logic Network (MLN) to capture the discourse-level consistency between Chinese trigger mentions to further recover those poor-2162 context event mentions.",
        "In a word, all of above mechanisms focus on supervised event extraction and no literature involves in the event inference of semi-supervised event extraction.",
        "3 Semi-supervised Model for Chinese Event Extraction In this section, we refine a semi-supervised model for Chinese event extraction as a baseline, which includes two views, the document-centric view and pattern similarity-centric view.",
        "3.1 Semi-supervised Model Liao and Grishman (2010a) proposed a state-of-the-art semi-supervised event extraction system, which was a pattern-based approach and adopted bootstrapping mechanism to extract relevant patterns.",
        "Besides, two distinct views, the document-centric view and the pattern similarity-centric view as described in Subsection 3.2 and 3.3, are incorporated in the bootstrapping procedure to rank event patterns on different metrics.",
        "In each iteration, the candidate patterns, which extracted from unlabeled texts as the candidates of relevant patterns, are ranked following the document-centric view, then the candidate patterns with pattern similarity scores below a similarity threshold (0.9 in (Liao and Grish-man, 2010a)) will be removed; only top 3 candidate patterns in the ranking scores of the document-centric view will be accepted as relevant patterns.",
        "In addition, if no pattern is found in the current iter-ation, the threshold will be reduced by 0.1 until new relevant patterns are extracted.",
        "As we mentioned earlier, the open and flexible structure of Chinese sentences results in the diversity of Chinese event patterns.",
        "Moreover, the syntax or semantic path is often used to represent event patterns, but the performance in Chinese syntactic parsers and Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) tools is lower than that in English.",
        "Therefore, we refine this semi-supervised model to suit Chinese event extraction in three aspects as follows, due to the above characteristics of Chinese language.",
        "Firstly, we construct a refined event pattern representation of Chinese events.",
        "Liao and Grishman (2010a) used semantic roles to represent the relationship between the trigger and its arguments.",
        "Due to the wide spread of ellipsis (especially entities) and the relatively low performance of Chinese SRL, pairwise (trigger-entity) representation and dependency path are introduced to represent Chinese event pattern in our refined model.",
        "Hence, the event pattern in this paper is a triple-style template as follows.",
        "<trigger, entity type, their dependency path > A pattern is formed by a trigger, the entity type of its argument1 and the dependency path from the trigger to the argument.",
        "For example, trigger ?returned?",
        "and its argument ?peacekeepers?",
        "(entity type: PER) in sentence S1 can be described as a pattern <returned, PER, nsubj>.",
        "Secondly, we introduce a novel mechanism to extract candidate patterns.",
        "Since verb and noun dominate in triggering an event in Chinese and they are chosen as candidate triggers to create candidate patterns.",
        "Besides, since different event types may have different roles and different roles are fulfilled by entities with different types, the entities whose types can fulfil the core roles of a specific event are chosen as candidate entities.",
        "For example, Attacker and Target are the core roles of event Attack and entity types PER/ORG/GPE2 can fulfil above two roles, so we only accept those entities, whose types belong to PER/ORG/GPE, to form candidate patterns.",
        "For each sentence in the unlabeled data, all candidate trigger-entity pairs and their dependency path are enumerated as candidate patterns.",
        "Finally, we present a new mechanism to generate seed patterns based on seed triggers.",
        "Considering the relatively large number of Chinese triggers and the flexibility of Chinese sentences, an instance-based approach is adopted by enumerating a few high-quality seed triggers with explicit meaning and high probability to trigger a specific event.",
        "Instead of dozens of predefined patterns required in previous studies, only one seed trigger is given to each event type or subtype without any predefined patterns.",
        "Hence, all patterns consisting of a seed trigger in the candidate patterns are accepted as seed patterns for their high probability to trigger a specific event.",
        "3.2 Document-centric View The document-centric view regards those documents containing the patterns always identified as relevant to a specific event as relevant documents and concludes that they are likely to contain additional 1 All event arguments must be entity mentions following the ACE 2005 annotation guidelines of events.",
        "2 PER/ORG/GPE refers to person, organization and geo-political entity respectively, which are annotated in the ACE 2005 corpus.",
        "These helpful information can be seen as ontological classes.",
        "2163 relevant patterns.",
        "Hence, those candidate patterns occurring in the relevant documents frequently will be extracted as relevant ones.",
        "Following Yangarber et al. (2000) and Liao and Grishman (2010a), we also employ the disjunctive voting scheme to calculate the ranking scores Rscore(p) of pattern p as follows.",
        "?",
        "?",
        "?",
        "?",
        ")p(Ld )p(Ld Score )d(lRelog*)p(L )d(lRe )p(R = (1) where L(p) is the set of documents, which contain candidate pattern p, and Rel(d) is the relevance score of document d as follows.",
        "?",
        "?",
        "?",
        "?-- Pp )p(Ld ' ) )p(L )d(lRe 1(1)d(lRe = (2) where Rel?",
        "(d) is the relevance score of document d in the previous iteration.",
        "Initially the relevance score of document d is set to n if document d has n relevant patterns in the set of extracted patterns P. 3.3 Pattern Similarity-centric View The similarity-centric view tries to find the candidate patterns who are similar to those seed patterns.",
        "The similarity scores derive from two aspects, lexical similarity and syntactic similarity, while the former is based on the trigger and entity type in a pattern and the latter is based on the relation between the trigger and the entity.",
        "Especially, we realize the pattern similarity view following the lexical and syntactic similarity, and refine the similarity ranking score Iscore(p) of candidate pattern p as fol-lows: )d,d(DSim)e,e(ESim)t,t(WSim(Max)p(I spspspPsscore ?",
        "?= ?",
        "(3) where t, e and d represent the trigger, entity type and dependency path in candidate pattern p(tp, ep, dp) or seed pattern s(ts, es, ds) in the set of extracted patterns P, respectively; ESim identifies whether two entities have the same type, and assigned 1 if two entities have the same entity type and otherwise a small number 0.1; DSim calculates the similarity between two dependency paths in edit distance.",
        "Fi-nally, WSim is to obtain the trigger similarity in lexical semantics, using Hownet (Dong and Dong, 2006) following Liu and Li (2002): ?",
        "?",
        "??",
        "),(),( spsp ttDisttWSim (4) where Dis(tp,ts) is the distance between the sememes of triggers tp and ts, in HowNet's sememe hierarchical architecture, with parameter ?",
        "assigned 0.75 following Liu and Li (2002).",
        "4 Event Inference The pattern-based semi-supervised model cannot extract those event mentions matching infrequent patterns or without matching patterns.",
        "The knowledge from linguistic aspect (e.g., definition of events, compositional semantics of Chinese words, coreference events and relevant events, etc.)",
        "is helpful to further recover missing event mentions or filter pseudo event mentions.",
        "In this section, various kinds of event inference mechanisms based on linguistic knowledge are proposed to improve the performance of semi-supervised Chinese event extraction.",
        "We unify the semi-supervised model and the event inference mechanisms into one model as follows: In each iteration, after the top 3 patterns have been chosen following the document-centric view and event mentions in the unlabeled data have been extracted by pattern matching, all event inference 2164 mechanisms are applied to recover missing event mentions,.",
        "Due to our inference mechanisms are trigger-based and each inferred event mention may have more than one pattern while most of them are noisy, we do not add those patterns in the set of relevant patterns for bootstrapping.",
        "4.1 Event Inference on Role Semantics The core of an event can be expressed as ?Who do What to Whom?",
        "in which ?Who?",
        "and ?Whom?",
        "are the core roles3 to participate in an event, while ?What?",
        "often refers to event trigger.",
        "The relationship between the verbal trigger and its core roles are the key clues to express event semantics.",
        "Since the subject or object always play the core roles in an event mention, SVO (Sbject-Verb-Object) is a better representation of event pattern.",
        "However, ellipsis is a widespread phenomenon in Chinese language and many sentences do not have an overt subject or object, so lots of event mentions cannot be represented as SVO pattern.",
        "In this paper, we only use the trigger-entity pair to represent event pattern and one of the disadvantages of this representation is its loose constraint on events, which will extract lots of pseudo event mentions.",
        "In most cases in Chinese, the object is often the most important core role to identify a specific event and it is more helpful than the subject to distinguish true event mentions from pseudo ones.",
        "Take following two sentences as examples: S2: ??",
        "(PER) ?(hit)?",
        "????(PER)?",
        "(The teacher hit this student.)",
        "S3: ??",
        "(PER) ?(call)?",
        "??",
        "?",
        "????(PER)?",
        "(The teacher made a phone call to this stu-dent.)",
        "The relation between verb ?",
        "(hit) and object????",
        "(this student) is clear to indicate sentence S2 is an Attack event mention since the object is a person, while object ??",
        "(phone) in sentence S3 is not a person and it indicates this sentence is not an Attack event mention following the sense of verb ?",
        "(call).",
        "Therefore, the object is an effective evidence to indicate event mentions and it is incorporated in our model to remove pseudo event mentions as follows.",
        "Role Semantics: If the object of a candidate verbal trigger mention is not an entity or its entity type cannot fulfil the object roles (e.g., Victim in events Injure and Die) in a specific event, this candidate trigger mention4 will be inferred as pseudo one.",
        "For example, core role Target of event Attack often acts as the object of a verbal trigger and entity types PER, ORG and GPE can fulfill this role according to be definition of event Attack in the ACE 2005 corpus.",
        "Hence, a candidate trigger mention of event Attack will be regarded as pseudo one when this mention has an object which is not an entity or whose entity type is not PER, ORG or GPE.",
        "4.2 Event Inference on Compositional Semantics In Chinese language, a word is composed of one or more characters.",
        "Almost all Chinese characters have their own meanings and are morpheme (or single-morpheme word), the minimal meaningful unit.",
        "If a Chinese word contains more than one character, its meaning can often be derived from its composite morphemes.",
        "This more fine-grained semantics is compositional semantics of Chinese words.",
        "Ac-tually, it is also a normal way for a native Chinese speaker to understand a new Chinese word.",
        "Two-morpheme words are used widely in Chinese language and almost all Chinese triggers contain one or two morphemes.",
        "The compositional semantics of a two-morpheme word comes from both its morphemes and morphological structure.",
        "Besides morphological structure Coordination, all other morphological structures (e.g., Modifier-Head, Predicate-Object, Predicate-Complement (Li and zhou, 2012)) always have one head morpheme, the morpheme as the governing semantic element, to express the meaning of a word.",
        "Commonly, there are two head morphemes in a two-morpheme word of Coordination structure.",
        "In particular, a two-morpheme word triggers an event if its two head morphemes are homogeneous (e.g., ?(attack)?",
        "(attack), ?(die)?(die)).",
        "Otherwise, it may refer to more than one event and this means that two triggers are within a word whose morphological structure is Coordination.",
        "Take the following sentence as an example: 3 We select core roles following the ACE Chinese annotation guidelines of events.",
        "Agent/Victim are the core roles of events Die/Injure while Attacker/Target are the core roles of event Attack.",
        "4 Recognizing a trigger mention can be recast as identifying a corresponding event mention, since trigger is the main word which most clearly expresses the occurrence of an event.",
        "2165 S4: ?????",
        "(E2: Attack)?",
        "(E3: Die)?????",
        "(A younger stabbed (E2: Attack) a woman to death (E3: Die).)",
        "In S4, two-morpheme word ??",
        "(stab a person to death) is a trigger with the Coordination structure.",
        "There are two event mentions in sentence S4, one Attack (E2) and one Die (E3), while morpheme ?",
        "(stab) triggers an Attack event and ?",
        "(die) refers to a Die one.",
        "Almost all event extraction systems assigned only one event type to a trigger and this will lead to that the other event type does not have any patterns to match and then cannot be identified.",
        "To address this issue, we first identify those triggers who refers to two distinct events as follows: for each two-morpheme candidate trigger in the candidate patterns whose morphemes are m1 and m2, it will be identified as candidate trigger with two event types and split into two single-morpheme word to generate two candidate trigger mentions when the following three conditions are satisfied: 1) )m(POSverb)m(POSverb 21 ???",
        "2) )s(Etype)s(Etype))s,m(Wsim())s,m(Wsim( MaxMax seedssseedss 212211 11 21 ???",
        "??",
        "??",
        "3) Morph(m1 m2)= Coordination where POS(m) returns all possible parts of speech of morpheme m in Hownet and Etype(s) is to obtain the event type of seed trigger s; WSim(m,s) is defined in Subsection 3.3 and returns 1 when one word m is the synonym of the other word s; Morph(w) is to obtain the morphological structure of word w following Li and Zhou (2012).",
        "Since there is a strong trigger consistency in those two-morpheme words of Coordination structure which refers to two distinct events, we propose an event inference mechanism as follows.",
        "Compositional semantics: For each two-morpheme word identified by the above three conditions, if one of its morphemes has been extracted as an trigger mention of a specific event type, the other morpheme in the same word will refer to an a relevant event type.",
        "4.3 Event Inference on Coreference Events To mine more event mentions, we use the simple trigger-entity pair to represent event pattern in this paper.",
        "However, lots of event mentions still cannot be extracted due to the ellipsis of arguments.",
        "Take following sentences as examples: S5: ?????????????",
        "(E4: Meeting)?",
        "(The US and DPRK finished talking (E4: Meeting) in Kuala Lumpur.)",
        "S6: ??",
        "(E5: Meeting)??????",
        "(The talks (E5: Meeting) are serious.)",
        "Obviously, more than one pattern of event mention E4 can be generated from sentence S5, since it contains more than one entity.",
        "On the contrary, no pattern can be extracted from S6 and this leads to event mention E5 cannot be extracted in our pattern-based semi-supervised model.",
        "Within a document, almost all event mentions are around a topic and there is a strong trigger con-sistency: if one mention of a word triggers a specific event, its other mentions in the same document will refer to the same event type.",
        "Besides, similar words (e.g., ?",
        "(bomb), ??",
        "(bomb), ??",
        "(bomb)), which contains the same head morpheme, always express the same or similar meaning following the principle of compositional semantics.",
        "Similarly, there is a strong trigger consistency on those similar words: If one mention of a word refers to a specific event, the mentions of its similar words in the same document will trigger events of the same type.",
        "Since the mentions of the same word or similar words are often coreference ones and always refer to the same event type, we propose an event inference mechanism on coreference events to recover missing event mentions based on head morpheme as follows.",
        "In particular, head morphemes are also identified following Li and Zhou (2012).",
        "Coreference events: 1) if a mention of a candidate trigger refers to a specific event, all its other mentions in the same document will trigger the same type event; 2) if one mention of a candidate trigger refers to a specific event, all the mentions of its similar words in the same document will trigger the same type event too.",
        "4.4 Event Inference on Relevant Events The bootstrapping procedure of the document-centric view selects frequent patterns in relevant docu-2166 ments and ignores those infrequent patterns both in relevant or irrelevant documents.",
        "However, the number of infrequent patterns in Chinese is larger than that in English, due to its open and flexible sentence structure, as mentioned in Subsection 3.1.",
        "Besides the pattern-based semi-supervised model, we propose a trigger-based mechanism as a supplement to recover those missing event mentions concerning infrequent patterns following this as-sumption: if a trigger mention refers a specific event in a document, there is a high probability that its relevant events occur in the same document.",
        "Take the following sentence as an example: S7: ???",
        "(E6: Attack)???",
        "1???????",
        "(E7: Die)?",
        "(An Arabian was dying (E7: Die) in this conflict (E6: Attack).)",
        "In sentence S7, there is an extracted Die event mention E7 triggered by ??",
        "(die) and ??",

        "Since the seed triggers have a high probability to trigger a specific event, to further explore those missing event mentions, we expand this inference mechanism following compositional semantics in Chinese and expand the condition as follows: This candidate trigger occurs in the other documents as an event trigger or contains one of the seed triggers, which refers to the relevant events of this identified trigger mentions.",
        "5 Experimentation In this section, we systematically evaluate our event inference mechanisms on the ACE 2005 Chinese corpus and provide the analysis.",
        "5.1 Experimental Setting The ACE 2005 Chinese corpus is the only available corpus in Chinese event extraction and it is used in all our experiments.",
        "This corpus contains 633 documents annotated with 33 predefined types.",
        "Due to evaluation on all 33 types is a hard work for the time-consuming bootstrapping procedure and the diversity of distinct event types, most of previous works selected part of event types for evaluation.",
        "In this paper, 3 event types (i.e.",
        "Die, Injure and Attack) are selected for evaluation, because they reflect the relevance of different event types and occur at different frequencies in the corpus.",
        "While events Die and Injure are easy to define, event Attack is rather complicated and can be divided into several subtypes.",
        "In the ACE 2005 Chinese corpus, almost one third of the annotated event mentions belong to the above three event types.",
        "Moreover, we report the experimental results on all 33 event types to further verify the effectiveness of our inference mechanisms in Subsection 5.2.",
        "Unlike MUC shared task, which only distinguishes whether a sentence contains a specific event mention or not, we follow previous studies on the ACE 2005 corpus and report the performance of trigger-based event extraction: a trigger is correctly identified if its position and event type match a reference trigger.",
        "As for evaluation, we use the ground truth entities, time and values annotated in the ACE 2005 Chinese corpus, and report the micro-average Precision (P), Recall (R) and F1-score (F1).",
        "Table 1 shows the seed triggers for the three event types.",
        "For example, only one seed trigger is provided for either the Die or Injure event, while three seed triggers are given for event Attack.",
        "Since the Attack event contains several distinct event subtypes, we assign one seed trigger to each of its major subtypes.",
        "Thus, all patterns whose triggers belong to the set of seed triggers are accepted as seed patterns automatically.",

        "Event Die and Injure also gain a significant improvement of 7.7% and 8.3% in F1-score respectively, largely due to the increase in recall, while their precisions reduce rapidly due to those pseudo event mentions inferred by our inference mechanisms.",
        "However, the loss of precision of event Attack is much less than these of events Die and Injure.",
        "The reason is that the inference on role semantics mainly impacts on Attack events to remove pseudo event mentions.",

        "It indicates that our event inference mechanisms perfect better than the baseline in all three sub-corpora and that results confirm the huge influence of the event inference mechanisms.",
        "It also shows that the WebLog sub-corpus reports the worst F1-score due to the low document quality and the low percentage of relevant documents, and that the Newswire sub-corpus reports significantly better performance than the Broadcast News sub-corpus due to its spoken nature.",
