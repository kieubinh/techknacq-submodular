        "A head-dependents relation (HDR) is composed of a head and all its dependents, which can be viewed as an instance of a sentence pattern or phrase pattern.",
        "However, since dependency trees are much flatter than constituency trees, the dependency-to-string model suffers more severe non-syntactic phrase coverage problem (Meng et al., 2013) than constituency-based models (Galley et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006).",
        "Non-syntactic phrases are those phrases that can not be covered by whole subtrees.",

        "2 Background For convenience of the description of our augmented dependency-to-string model, we first briefly review the dependency-to-string model and the fixed and floating structures of string-to-dependency model (Shen et al., 2008).",
        "2.1 Dependency-to-String Translation The dependency-to-string model (Xie et al., 2011) takes head-dependents relations as the elementary structures of dependency trees, and represents the translation rules with the source side as HDRs and the target side as string.",
        "Since the HDRs in essence relate to phrase patterns and sentence patterns, the HDR rules specify the reordering of these patterns.",
        "For example, Figure 1 (a) is an example HDR rule, which represents a reordering manner of a sentence pattern composed of a proper noun (X1:PN), a temporal noun (X2:NT), an prepositional phrase relate to ??",
        "(give)?",
        "(X3:?",
        "), a verb (X4:VV) and a noun (X5:NN).",
        "With the HDR rules, the dependency-to-string model gets rid of the extra reordering heuristics and reordering models of the previous models (Lin, 2004; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Quirk et al., 2005).",
        "More importantly, the model shows state-of-the-art performance and exhibits good long distance reordering property.",
        "2.2 Fixed and Floating Structures The fixed structures and floating structures are fundamental structures of the string-to-dependency model (Shen et al., 2008), which are introduced to handle the coverage of non-constituent rules.",
        "Given the dependency tree d 1 d 2 ...d n of a sentence f 1 f 2 ...f n , where d i indicates the parent word index of word f i .",

        "[i, j] and k 6= h, d k ?",
        "[i, j] - ?k /?",

        "In nature, the fixed and floating structures represent the phrases under the structural constraint of dependency trees, most of them are non-syntactic phrases.",
        "The HDRs are good at handling long distance dependencies, while the fixed and floating structures excels at handling local reordering.",
        "This encourages us to address the non-syntactic phrase coverage problem of dependency-to-string model by exploiting these two kinds of structures.",
        "3 Augmented Dependency-to-String Translation In the following, we will describe our augmented dependency-to-string model in detail, including the augmented HDR rules (Section 3.1), rule acquisition (Section 3.2) and ?on-the-fly?",
