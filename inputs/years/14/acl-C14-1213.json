        "The ?one sense per discourse?",
        "(OSPD) hypothesis was introduced by Gale et al. (1992), and stated that a word tends to preserve its meaning when occurring multiple times in a discourse.",
        "They estimated that the probability of two occurrences of the same polysemous noun drawn from one document having the same sense to be around 94% for documents from Grolier encyclopedia, and 96% for documents from Brown, based on word senses from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary and a handful of examples.",
        "A few years later, Krovetz (1998) reported 66% on larger corpora (SemCor and DSO) annotated with WordNet senses by third parties, but, unfortunately, he only reported how many polysemous nouns occurred with a single sense in all documents, not in each document.",
        "In the context of statistical machine translation, Carpuat (2009) reported that, 80% of the time, words occurring multiple times in a source document are translated into a single word in the target language.",
        "In the case of entities, OSPD is closely related to coreference, where the task is to find whether two different mentions (perhaps using different surface strings like ?John?",
        "and ?he?)",
        "in a document refer to the same entity or not.",
        "For instance, the coreference system presented by (Lee et al., 2013), uses a heuristic which links mentions in a document that share the same surface string: ?This sieve [heuristic] accounts for approximately 16 CoNLL F1 points improvement, which proves that a signicant percentage of mentions in text are indeed repetitions of previously seen concepts?.",
        "Our paper actually quantifies the amount of those repetitions for entities, providing additional evidence for the heuristic.",
        "The ?one sense per collocation?",
        "(OSPC) hypothesis was introduced by Yarowsky (1993), stating that a word tends to preserve its meaning when occurring with the same collocate.",
        "Yarowsky tested his hypothesis for several definitions of collocate, including positional collocates (word to left or right) and syntactic collocations (governing verb of object, governing verb of subject, modifying adjective).",
        "He reported entropy on train data, as well as disambiguation performance on unseen data, with the precision ranging between 90% and 99% for a handful of words with two distinct homograph senses, like, e.g. ?bass?",
        "or ?colon?.",

        "In this paper, we take a collocation to be a word (or multiword term) that co-occurs with the target named-entity more often than would be expected by chance.",
        "In our case we use syntactic dependencies to extract co-occurring terms.",
        "These two hypotheses have been very influential, and have inspired multiple heuristics and methods in Word Sense Disambiguation research (Agirre and Edmonds, 2007, Chapters 5,7,10,11).",
        "In this work we are going to show that both hypotheses hold for named-entities as well, and that the hypotheses can be used to post-process the output of any Named-Entity Disambiguation system (NED) to improve its performance.",
        "NED, also known as Entity Linking, takes as input a named-entity mention in context and assigns it a specific entity from a given entity repository (Hachey et al., 2012; Daiber et al., 2013).",
        "In the first part of this work we are going to test whether the two hypotheses hold for entity mentions with respect to a repository of entities extracted from Wikipedia.",
        "For instance, do all occurrences of mention ?Abbott?",
        "in a document refer to the same entity?",
        "Do all occurrences of mention ?CPI?",
        "as subject of verb ?rise?",
        "refer to the same entity?",
        "Do all occurrences of ?CDU?",
        "in relation to ?Merkel?",
        "refer to the same entity?",
        "The examples in Figures 1 and 2 show evidence that this is indeed the case.",
        "The experiments aim at quantifying in which degree OSPD and OSPC hypotheses hold for entities 1 .",
        "In the second part of the paper, we will explore a simple method to incorporate OSPD and OSPC hypotheses to any existing NED system, showing their potential.",
        "After running the NED system, we take its output and observe, for each mention string, which is the entity returned most often for a given document (or collocation), assigning to all occurrences the majority entity.",
        "We tested the improvements with a freely available NED system (Daiber et al., 2013), a reimplementation of a strong Bayesian NED system (Han and Sun, 2011) and an in-house graph-based system.",
        "We got statistically significant improvements for all systems and ?one sense?",
        "hypotheses that we tested, with a couple exceptions.",
        "In order to check the OSPD and OSPC hypotheses for entities, we first looked into existing datasets.",
        "AIDA (Hoffart et al., 2011) 2 is a publicly available hand-tagged corpus based on the CoNLL named-entity recognition and disambiguation task dataset.",
        "AIDA contains links of all entity mentions in full documents, so it is a natural fit for OSPD.",
        "We estimated OSPD based on more than 4,000 mentions that occur multiple times in a document.",
        "For completeness, we also estimated OSPD at the collection level.",
        "OSPD and OSPC are independent of each other, as one is applied at the document level and the other at the corpus level, focusing on the entities that occur with a specific collocation.",
        "Multiple occurrences of a target string in a document usually occur with different collocations, and conversely, multiple occurrences of a target string with a specific collocation typically occur in different documents.",
        "Note also that singletons (entities that are only mentioned once in a document) are not affected by OSPD, but could be affected by OSPC.",
        "In order to estimate OSPC, no available corpus existed, so we decided to base our dataset on the TAC KBP 2009 Entity Linking dataset 3 (TAC2009 for short) (Ji et al., 2010).",
        "The TAC2009 dataset involves 138 mention strings, which have been annotated in several documents drawn primarily from Gigaword 4 .",

        "In addition, the corpus used in the task was very large, allowing us to mine relevant collocations (see below).",

        "We ignored all those cases (called NIL cases), as we would need to investigate, for each NIL, which actual entity they refer to.",
        "The collocations were extracted from the TAC KBP collection (Ji et al., 2010), comprising 1.7 million documents, 1.3 millions from newswire and 0.5 millions from the web.",
        "We have parsed them with the Stanford CoreNLP software (Klein and Manning, 2003), obtaining around 650 million dependencies (De Marneffe and Manning, 2008).",
        "We selected subject, object, prepositional complements and adjectival modifiers as the source for syntactic collocations.",
        "In order to provide more specific collo-cations, we implemented the syntactic patterns proposed in (Pe?nas and Hovy, 2010), which produce so-called propositions.",
        "The result is a database with 16 million distinct propositions.",
        "Table 1 shows the six patterns used in this work, together with some examples.",
        "In order to know whether a mention is ambiguous, we built a dictionary based on Wikipedia which lists, for each string mention, which entities it can refer to.",
        "We followed the construction method of (Spitkovsky and Chang, 2012), which checked article titles, redirects, disambiguation pages and hyperlinks to find mention strings that can be used to refer to entities.",
        "Contrary to them, we could not access hyperlinks in the web, so we could use only those in Wikipedia.",
        "According to our dictionary, the ambiguity of the mentions that we are studying is very high, 26.4 entities on average for the mentions in AIDA, and 62.6 entities on average for the mentions in TAC2009.",

        "In the denominator and numerator we count each mention-document pair once.",
        "Regarding AIDA, we found 12,084 occurrences of mentions which occurred more than once in a document, making 4,265 unique mention-document pairs 6 (cf. Table 2).",
        "In the vast majority of the cases those mentions refer to a single entity in the document, and only in 170 cases the mentions in the document refer to several entities.",
        "The last row in Table 2 shows the ratio between those values, 96.01%, showing that OSPD is strong in this dataset.",
        "We also checked OSPD in the TAC2009 dataset.",
        "Out of the 138 distinct mention strings used in the task, we discarded those only linked to NIL (that is, no corresponding Wikipedia article existed) and those which were not ambiguous (that is, they had only one entity in the dictionary, cf.",
        "Section 2).",
        "That leaves 105 mention strings, occurring 1,776 times in 918 different documents, which we annotated by hand.",
        "The 105 strings occurred 1,776 times in 918 documents.",
        "Removing the cases where the mention occurred only once, we were left with 1,173 occurrences, which make 334 unique mention-document pairs, of which only 6 occurred with more than one sense (rightmost row in Table 2).",
        "This yields an estimate for OSPD of 98.2%.",
        "6 By unique mention-document pairs we mean that we only count once for a mention occurring multiple times in a document.",

        "In the second two columns (?First mention?)",
        "we leave only the first mention of each document (in this case, there are 2, 731 mention types in AIDA which correspond to 15, 275 occurrences, and 105 types in TAC2009 corresponding to 941 occurrences).",
        "Finally, we also thought about measuring OSPD on the Wikipedia articles, where many mentions have been manually linked to their respective article.",
        "Unfortunately, we noted that Wikipedia guidelines explicitly prevent authors linking a mention multiple times: Generally, a link should appear only once in an article, but if helpful for readers, links may be repeated in infoboxes, tables, image captions, footnotes, and at the first occurrence after the lead 7 .",
        "The fact that Wikipedia editors did not explicitly state exceptions to the above rule (e.g. for cases where the word or phrase is used to refer to two different articles, thus breaking the OSPD hypothesis) is remarkable, and might indicate that Wikipedia editors had not felt the need to challenge the OSPD hypothesis.",
        "3.1 One entity per collection We took the opportunity to also explore ?one entity per collection?, which gives an idea of what is the spread of entities for whole document collections.",
        "In this case, there is no need to count mention-document pairs, as there is one single document, the collection, so we estimate the hypothesis according to mention types.",
        "The first two columns in table 3 shows that, overall, mentions which occurred more than once in the collection tend to refer to the same entity 85.9% of the time in AIDA, and 75.2% of the time in TAC2009.",
        "As we know that multiple mentions in a document tend to refer to one entity, the second two columns in table 3 offers the statistics when factoring out multiple occurrences of mention in a document, that is, leaving the first mention in each document.",
        "The statistics are very similar, with minor variations.",
        "We think that the lower estimate for TAC2009 is an artifact of how the TAC KBP organizers set up the dataset, as they were explicitly looking for cases where the target string would refer to different entities, making the task more challenging for NED systems.",
        "This fact does not affect OSPD for documents, as those strings still tend to refer to a single entity per document, but given the need to find occurrences for different entities, the organizers (Ji et al., 2010) did focus on strings occurring with different entities across the document collection.",
        "This is in contrast with AIDA, where they tagged all named-entities occurring in the target documents.",
        "Had the organizers of TAC2009 focused on a random choice of strings and documents, the one entity per collection would also hold to the high degree exhibited in AIDA, as the genre of most of the documents is also news (as in AIDA).",
