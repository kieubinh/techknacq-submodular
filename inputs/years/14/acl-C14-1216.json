        "Apart from that, we also exploit knowledge induced by semi-supervised graph-based clustering for two different purposes.",
        "On the one hand, we produce an auxiliary categorization of food items according to the Food Guide Pyramid, and assume that a food item is a type when it belongs to a category unlikely to contain brands.",
        "On the other hand, we directly model the task of brand detection using seeds provided by the output of the textual ranking features.",

        "Brands play a significant role in social life.",
        "They are the subject matter of many discussions in social media.",
        "Their automatic detection for information extraction tasks is a pressing problem since, despite their unique property to refer to commercial products of specific companies, in everyday language they often occur in similar contexts as common nouns.",
        "A typical domain where such behaviour can be observed is the food domain, where food brands (e.g. nutella or sprite) are often used synonymously with the food type1 of which the brand is a prototypical instance (e.g. chocolate spread or lemonade).",
        "Such usage is illustrated in (1) and (2).",
        "(1) In the evening, I eat a slice of bread with either nutella or marmalade.",
        "(2) I prepare my pancakes with baking soda, water and a lacing of sprite instead of sugar.",
        "This particular phenomenon of metonymy (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980), commonly referred to as genericized trademarks, of course, has consequences on automatic lexicon induction methods.",
        "If one automatically extracts food types, one also obtains food brands.",
        "In this paper, we examine features to detect brands automatically.",
        "Solving the issue with the help of a manually-compiled list of brands neglects parts of the nature of brands.",
        "Brands come and go.",
        "Some products may be discontinued after a certain amount of time (e.g. due to limited popularity) while, on the other hand, new products constantly enter the market.",
        "For instance, popular food brands, such as sierra mist or kazoozles, did not exist a decade ago.",
        "Therefore, a list of brands that is manually created today may not reflect the predominant food brands that will be available in a decade.",
        "The features we introduce to detect brands consider both the intrinsic properties of brands and their contextual environment.",
        "Even though in many contexts, brands are used as ordinary type expressions (1), there might be specific contexts that are only observed with brands.",
        "We also consider distributional properties: brands may co-occur with other brands.",
        "Moreover, they may be biased towards certain categories, e.g. sweets, beverages etc.",
        "For the latter, we actually exploit the usage of food brands to be ",
        "1We define food type as common nouns that denote a particular type of food, e.g. apple, chocolate, cheese etc.",

        "used as genericized trademarks, allowing food categorization methods for types to be easily extended to brands.",
        "Moreover, we examine how external knowledge resources, such as Wikipedia, can be harnessed as a means to separate brands from types.",
        "Our task is lexicon construction rather than contextual entity classification, that is, we are interested in what a food item generally conveys and not what it conveys in a specific context.",
        "We consider the food domain as a target domain since there are large, unlabeled domain-specific corpora available gathered from social media which are vital for the methods we explore.",
        "It is also a domain for which there has already been done research in the area of natural language processing (NLP), and there are common applications, such as virtual customer advice or product recommendation, that may exploit such NLP technology.",
        "The methods we consider require no, or hardly any human supervision.",
        "Thus, we imagine that they can also be applied to other domains at a low cost.",
        "In particular, other life-style domains, such as fashion, cosmetics or electronics show parallels, since comparable textual web data from which to extract domain-specific knowledge are available.",
        "Our experiments are carried out on German data, but our findings should carry over to other languages since the issues we address are (mostly) language universal.",
        "All examples are given as English translations.",
        "We use the term food item to refer to the union of food brands and food types.",
        "All food items will be written in lowercase reflecting the identical case spelling in German, i.e. types and brands are both written uppercase.",
        "In English, both types and brands can be written uppercase or lowercase2, however, there is a tendency in user-generated content/social media to write mostly lowercase.",
        "2 Motivation & Data Previous research on lexicon induction proposed a widely applicable method based on coordination (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Riloff and Shepherd, 1997; Roark and Charniak, 1998): First, a set of seed expressions that are typical of the categories one wants to induce are defined.",
        "Then, additional instances of those categories are obtained by extracting conjuncts of the seed expressions (i.e. all expressions that match <seed> and/or <expression> are extracted as new instances).",
        "A detailed study of such lexicon induction has recently been published by Ziering et al. (2013), who also point out the great semantic coherence of conjuncts.",
        "This method can also be applied to the food domain.",
        "As a domain-specific dataset for all our experi-ments, we use a crawl of chefkoch.de3 (Wiegand et al., 2012) consisting of 418, 558 webpages of forum entries.",
        "chefkoch.de is the largest German web portal for food-related issues.",
        "Table 1 shows the effectiveness of coordination as a means of extracting food items from our domain-specific corpus.",
        "Given a seed set of 10 frequent food items (we use: water, salt, sugar, salad, bread, meat, cake, flour, butter and 2There are plenty of food types that are written uppercase, e.g. Jaffa Cakes, Beef Wellington, BLT, Hoppin?",

        "potato), we compute all conjuncts and rank them according to frequency.",
        "We do this on our domain-specific corpus and on Wikipedia.",
        "As a baseline, we simply sort all nouns according to frequency in our domain-specific corpus.",
        "The table shows that ranking by frequency is no effective method.",
        "Conjuncts produce good results provided that they are extracted from a domain-specific corpus.",
        "Even though coordination is a very reliable method to induce food items, it fails to distinguish between food types and food brands.",
        "We produced a labeled food vocabulary to be used for all our subsequent experiments consisting of food types and food brands (see Table 2).",
        "The food types exclusively comprise the food vocabulary from Wiegand et al. (2014).",
        "The food brands were manually selected with the help of the web.",
        "We only include food items that occur at least 5 times in our corpus.",
        "In our food vocabulary, 87% of our food brands occur as a conjunct of a food type.",
        "Therefore, the problem of confusing brands with types is inherent to induction based on coordination.",
        "3 Intrinsic Properties Table 3 provides some statistics on intrinsic properties of our food items giving some indication which feature types might be used for this task.",
        "We also include some stylistic properties of brands that have been addressed in previous marketing research and applied psychology.",
        "We focus on fairly straightforward features from desirable brand name characteristics (Robertson, 1989), since we assume that there is more general agreement on the underlying concepts than there is on the concepts underlying complex sound symbolism (Klink, 2000; Yorkston and Menon, 2004).",
        "For the statistics in Table 3, most properties (i.e. all except length and word-initial plosives) have been detected manually.",
        "The reason for this is that their automatic detection is not trivial (e.g. there is no established algorithm to detect onomatopoeia; even the detection of rhyme or assonance is not straightforward given the low grapheme-phoneme correspondence of English).",
        "We did not want the statistics for this exploratory experiment to be distorted by error-proneness of the detection methods.",
        "Table 3 shows that a large part of brands are nonwords indicating that this task is hard to be solved with intrinsic features only.",
        "Since there is a high number of brands that are derived from some existing proper noun being either a person or a location, named-entity recognition might be applied to this task.",
        "Many brands are also foreign words.",
        "Unfortunately, applying language checking software on our food items turned out to perform poorly.",
        "(These tools are only effective on longer texts, e.g. sentences or entire documents, and do not work on isolated words, as in our problem setting.)",
        "We also noticed a difference in average word length between brands and types which is consistent with Robertson (1989) who claims that brand names should be simple.",
        "Most stylistic features seem to be less relevant to our task as they are either too infrequent or not discriminative.",
        "Therefore, we do not consider them as features for the detection of brands in our forthcoming experiments.",
        "2293 Figure 1: Processing Pipeline for ranking.",
        "Feature Type Features ranking feature LENGTH, COMMERCE, NER target , NER context , DIVERS, PAT mod , PAT pp reset feature GRAPH pyramid bootstrapping feature GRAPH brand , WIKI, VSM Table 4: Feature classification.",
        "4 Method Our aim is to determine predictive features for the detection of brands.",
        "Rather than employing some supervised learner that requires manually labeled training data, we want to convert these features directly into a classifier without costly labeled data.",
        "We conceive this task as a ranking task.",
        "The reason for using a ranking is that our features can be translated into a ranking score in a very straightforward manner.",
        "For the evaluation, we do not have to determine some empirical threshold separating the category brand from the category type.",
        "Instead, the evaluation measures we employ for ranking implicitly assume highly ranked instances as brands and instances ranked at the bottom as types.",
        "For the ranking task, we employ the processing pipeline as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Most of our features are designed in such a way that they assign a ranking score to each of our food items by counting how often a feature is observed with a food item; that is why we call these features ranking features.",
        "The resulting ranking should assign high scores to food brands and low scores to food types.",
        "If we want to combine several features into one ranking, we simply average for each food item the different ranking scores of the individual ranking features.",
        "This is possible since they have the same range [0; 1].",
        "We obtain such range by normalizing the number of occurrences of a feature with a particular food item by the total number of occurrences of that food item.",
        "The combination by averaging is unbiased as it treats all features equally.",
        "We also introduce a reset feature which is applied on top of an existing ranking provided by ranking features.",
        "A reset feature is a negative feature in the sense that it is usually a reliable cue that a food item is not a brand.",
        "If it fires for a particular food item, then its ranking score is reset to 0.",
        "Finally, we add bootstrapping features.",
        "These features produce an output similar to the ranking features (i.e. another ranking).",
        "However, unlike the ranking features, the bootstrapping features produce their output based on a weakly-supervised method which requires some labeled input.",
        "Rather than manually providing that input, we derive it from the combined output that is provided by the ranking and reset features.",
        "We restrict ourselves to instances with a high-confidence prediction, which translates to the top and bottom end of a ranking.",
        "(Since the instances are not manually labeled, of course, not every label assignment will be correct.",
        "We hope, however, that by restricting to instances with a high-confidence prediction, we can reduce the amount of errors to a minimum.)",
        "The output of a bootstrapping feature is combined with the set of ranking features to a new ranking onto which again a reset feature is applied.",
        "Table 4 shows which feature (each will be discussed below) belongs to which of the above feature types (i.e. ranking, reset or bootstrapping features).",
        "Most features (i.e. all except WIKI) are extracted from our domain-specific corpus introduced in ?2.",
        "2294 4.1 Length Since we established that brands tend to be shorter than types (?3), we add one feature that ranks each food item according to its number of characters.",
        "4.2 Target Named-Entity Recognition (NER target ) Brands can be considered a special kind of named entities.",
        "We apply a part-of-speech tagger to count how often a food item has been tagged as a proper noun.",
        "We decided against a named-entity recognizer as it usually only recognizes persons, locations and organizations, while part-of-speech taggers employ a general tag for all proper nouns (that may go well beyond the three afore-mentioned common types).",
        "We use a statistical tagger, i.e. TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994), that also employs features below the word level.",
        "As many of our food items will be unknown words, a character-level analysis may still be able to make useful predictions.",
        "4.3 Contextual Named-Entity Recognition (NER context ) We also count the number of other named entities that co-occur with the target food brand within the same sentence.",
        "We are only interested in organizations; an organization co-occurring with a brand is likely to be the company producing that brand (e.g.",
        "He loves Kellogg's company frosties brand .)",
        "For this feature, we rely on the output of a named-entity recognizer for German (Chrupa?a and Klakow, 2010).",
        "4.4 Diversification (DIVERS) Once a product has established itself on the market for a substantial amount of time, many companies introduce variants of their brand to further consolidate their market position.",
        "The purpose of this diversification is to appeal to customers with special needs.",
        "A typical variant of food brands are light products.",
        "In many cases, the names of variants consist of the name of the original brand with some prefix or suffix indicating the particular type of variant (e.g. mini babybel or philadelphia light).",
        "We manually compiled 11 affixes and check for each food item how often it is accompanied by one of them.",
        "4.5 Commerce Cues (COMMERCE) Presumably, brands are more likely to be mentioned in the context of commercial transaction events than types.",
        "Therefore, we created a list of words that indicate these types of events.",
        "The list was created ad hoc.",
        "We used external resources, such as FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) or GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997) (the German version of WordNet (Miller et al., 1990)), and made no attempt to tune that list to our domain-specific food corpus.",
        "The final list (85 cues in total) comprises: verbs (and deverbal nouns) that convey the event of a commercial transaction (e.g. buy, purchase or sell), persons involved in a commercial transaction (e.g. customer or shop assistant), means of purchase (e.g. money, credit card or bill), places of purchase (e.g. supermarket or shop) and judgment of price (e.g. cheap or expensive).",
        "4.6 Food Modifier (PAT mod ) Even though many mentions of brands are similar to those of types, there exist some particular contexts that are mostly observed with brands.",
        "If the food item to be classified often occurs as a modifier of another food item, then the target item is likely to be some brand.",
        "This is due to the fact that many brands are often mentioned in combination with the food type that they represent, e.g. volvic mineral water, nutella chocolate spread.",
        "4.7 Prepositional Phrase Embedding (PAT pp ) Instead of appearing as a modifier (?4.6), a brand may also be embedded in some prepositional phrase that has a similar meaning, e.g. We only buy the chocolate spread [by nutella] PP .",
        "4.8 Graph-based Methods (GRAPH) We also employ some semi-supervised graph clustering method in order to assign semantic types to food items as introduced in Wiegand et al. (2014).",
        "The underlying data structure is a food graph that is generated automatically from our domain-specific corpus where nodes represent food items and edge weights 2295 Category Description General Brands MEAT meat and fish (products) 19.48 1.31 BEVERAGE beverages (incl.",
        "alcoholic drinks) 17.19 23.96 SWEET sweets, pastries and snack mixes 14.90 25.60 SPICE spices and sauces 10.53 2.42 VEGE vegetables (incl.",

        "represent the similarity between different items.",
        "The weights are computed based on the frequency of co-occurrence within a similarity pattern (e.g. X instead of Y).",
        "Food items that cluster with each other in such a graph (i.e. food items that often co-occur in a similarity pattern) are most likely to belong to the same class.",
        "For the detection of brands, we examine two different types of food categorization.",
        "We always use the same clustering method (Wiegand et al., 2014) and the same graph.",
        "Depending on the specific type of categorization, we only change the seeds to fit the categories to be induced.",
        "4.8.1 Categories of the Food Guide Pyramid (GRAPH pyramid ) The first categorization we consider is the categorization of food items according to the Food Guide Pyramid (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1992) as examined in Wiegand et al. (2014).",
        "We observed that food brands are not equally distributed throughout the entire range of food items.",
        "There is a notable bias of food brands towards beverages (mostly soft drinks and alcoholic drinks), sweets, snack mixes, dairy products and fat.",
        "Other categories, e.g. nuts, vegetables or meat, hardly contain brands.",
        "The category inventory and the proportion among types and brands are displayed in Table 5.",
        "We use the category information as a negative feature, that is, we re-set the ranking score to 0 if the category of the food item is either MEAT, SPICE, VEGE, STARCH, FRUIT, GRAIN or EGG.",
        "In order to obtain a category assignment to our food vocabulary, we re-run the best configuration from Wiegand et al. (2014) including the choice of category seeds.",
        "We just extend the graph that formerly only contained food types by nodes representing brands.",
        "We use no manually-compiled knowledge regarding food brands.",
        "Even though the seed food items are exclusively food types, we hope to be also able to make inferences regarding food brands.",
        "This is illustrated in Figure 2(a): The brand mars can be grouped with food types that are sweets, therefore, we conclude that mars is also some sweet.",
        "(Brands can be grouped with food types of their food category, since food brands are often used as if they were types (?1)).",
        "Since sweets are plausible candidates for brands (Table 5), mars is likely to be some brand.",
        "We think that such bias of brands towards certain subcategories is also present in other domains.",
        "For example, in the electronic domain laptops will have a much larger variety of brands than network cables.",
        "Similarly, in the fashion domain there exist much more shoe brands than sock brands.",
        "4.8.2 Direct Graph Clustering Separating Brands from Types (GRAPH brand ) We also apply graph clustering directly for the separation of brands from types, i.e. we assign some brand and type seeds and then run graph-based clustering (Figure 2(b)).",
        "In order to combine the output of this clustering with that of the previous methods, we interpret the confidence of the output as a ranking score.",
        "As we pursue an unsupervised approach, we do not manually label the seeds but rely on the output of a ranker using a combination of above features (Figure 1).",
        "Instances at the top of the ranking are considered brand seeds, while instances at the bottom are considered type seeds.",
        "4There may be companies which, among other things, also sell these food types, but we do not want to extract the names of organizations (as in traditional named-entity recognition), e.g. Kraft Foods, but specific product names, e.g. philadelphia.",
        "2296 (a) food type categorization (b) brand detection Figure 2: Similarity graphs; bold items are seeds; line width of edges represents strength of similarity.",
        "4.9 Wikipedia Bootstrapping (WIKI) For many information extraction tasks, the usage of collaboratively-edited resources is increasingly becoming popular.",
        "One of the largest resources of that type is Wikipedia.",
        "For our vocabulary of food items, we could match 57% of the food brands and 53% of the food types with a Wikipedia article.",
        "Even though Wikipedia may hold some useful information for the detection of brands, this information is not readily available in a structured format, such as infoboxes.",
        "This is illustrated by (3)-(5) which display the first sentence of three Wikipedia articles, where (3) and (4) are food brands and (5) is a food type.",
        "There is some thematic overlap across the two categories (e.g. (4) and (5) describe the ingredients of the food item).",
        "However, if one also considers the entire articles, some notable topical differences between brands and types become obvious.",
        "The articles of food brands typically focus on commercial aspects (i.e. market situation and product history) while articles of food types describe the actual food item (e.g. by distinguishing it from other food items or naming its origin).",
        "Therefore, a binary topic classification based on the entire document should be a suitable approach.",
        "In the light of the diversified language employed for articles on brands (cp.",
        "(3)-(4)), we consider a bag-of-words classifier more effective than applying some textual patterns on those texts.",
        "(3) BRAND: Twix is a chocolate bar made by Mars, Inc. (4) BRAND: Smarties is a brand under which Nestle?",
        "produces colour-varied sugar-coated chocolate lentils.",
        "(5) TYPE: Milk chocolate is a type of chocolate made from cocoa produce (cocoa bean, cocoa butter), sugar, milk or dairy products.",
        "Similar to GRAPH brand (?4.8.2), we harness Wikipedia via a bootstrapping method.",
        "We generate a labeled training set of Wikipedia articles representing brands and types using the combined output of the ranking features (+ reset feature).",
        "We then train a supervised classifier on these data and classify all articles representing food items of our food vocabulary.",
        "We use the output score of the classifier for the article of each food item (which amounts to some confidence score) and thus obtain a ranking score.",
        "For those food items for which no Wikipedia entry exists, we produce a score of 0.",
        "4.10 Vector Space Model (VSM) While GRAPH brand (?4.8.2) determines similar food items by means of highly weighted edges in a similarity graph (that represent the frequency of co-occurrences with a similarity pattern), we also examine whether distributional similarity can be harnessed for the same purpose.",
        "We represent each food item as a vector, where the vector components encode the frequency of words that co-occur with mentions of the food item in a fixed window of 5 words (in our domain-specific corpus).",
        "Similar to GRAPH brand (?4.8.2) and WIKI (?4.9), we consider the n highest and m lowest ranked food items provided by ranking features (+ reset feature) as labeled brand and type instances for a supervised classifier.",

        "For this evaluation, we partition the output of automatic categorization into (actual) types and brands.",
