        "We develop an instance (token) based extension of the state of the art word (type) based part-of-speech induction system introduced in (Yatbaz et al., 2012).",
        "Each word instance is represented by a feature vector that combines information from the target word and probable substitutes sampled from an n-gram model representing its context.",
        "Modeling ambiguity using an instance based model does not lead to significant gains in overall accuracy in part-of-speech tagging because most words in running text are used in their most frequent class (e.g. 93.69% in the Penn Treebank).",
        "However it is important to model ambiguity because most frequent words are ambiguous and not modeling them correctly may negatively affect upstream tasks.",
        "Our main contribution is to show that an instance based model can achieve significantly higher accuracy on ambiguous words at the cost of a slight degradation on unambiguous ones, maintaining a comparable overall accuracy.",
        "On the Penn Treebank, the overall many-to-one accuracy of the system is within 1% of the state-of-the-art (80%), while on highly ambiguous words it is up to 70% better.",
        "On multilingual experiments our results are significantly better than or comparable to the best published word or instance based systems on 15 out of 19 corpora in 15 languages.",
        "The vector representations for words used in our system are available for download for further experiments."

        "Unsupervised part-of-speech (POS) induction aims to classify words into syntactic categories using un-labeled, plain text input.",
        "The problem of induction is important for studying under-resourced languages that lack labeled corpora and high quality dictionaries.",
        "It is also essential in modeling child language acquisition because every child manages to induce syntactic categories without access to labeled sen-tences, labeled prototypes, or dictionary constraints (Ambridge and Lieven, 2011).",
        "Categories induced from data may point to shortcomings or inconsistencies of hand-labeled categories as discussed in Section 4.",
        "Finally, the induced categories or the vector representations generated by the induction algorithms may improve natural language processing systems when used as additional features.",

        "Instance-based systems classify each occurence of a word separately and can handle ambiguous words.",
        "Examples of word-based systems include ones that represent each word with the vector of neighboring words (context vectors) and cluster them (Sch?utze, 1995; Lamar et al., 2010b; Lamar et al., 2010a), use a prototypical bi-tag HMM that assigns each word to a latent class (Brown et al., 1992; Clark, 2003), restrict a HMM based Pitman-Yor process to perform one-tag-per-word inference (Blunsom and Cohn, 2011), define a word-based Bayesian multinomial mixture model (Christodoulopoulos et al., 2011), or This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",

        "For example, the word offer is tagged as NN(399), VB(105) and VBP(34) 1 in its 538 occurrences in the human labeled Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Section of the Penn Treebank (PTB) corpus (Marcus et al., 1999).",
        "If all instances of offer are assigned to the most frequent tag NN, 36% (139/538) will be erroneously labeled.",
        "In spite of this shortcoming, word-based POS induction systems generally do well because the one-tag-per-word assumption is mostly accurate: 93.69% of the word occurrences are tagged with their most frequent POS tag in the PTB (Toutanova et al., 2003).",
        "In order to handle ambiguous words, models without a strict one-tag-per-word assumption need to group word instances into clusters according to their contexts.",
        "Some of these instance-based models bias words to have few tags using sparse priors in a Bayesian setting (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; John-son, 2007; Gao and Johnson, 2008), or posterior regularization (Ganchev et al., 2010).",
        "Sch?utze (1993) represents the context of a word instance by concatenating context vectors of its left and right neighboring words, and clusters word instances.",
        "Berg-Kirkpatrick et al. (2010) use an EM algorithm where they replace the multinomial components with miniature logistic regressions and achieve the highest instance-based accuracy on PTB.",
        "Christodoulopoulos et al. (2010) select prototypes of each cluster from the output of Brown (1992) and feed them to a HMM model that can handle prototypes as features (Haghighi and Klein, 2006).",
        "However none of these models achieve results comparable to the best word-based systems.",
        "In this work, we show that one can build an instance-based system that can perform significantly better on highly ambiguous words (see Figure 1) and yet is competitive with word-based systems in overall accuracy.",
        "We follow the state of the art word-based system (Yatbaz et al., 2012) and use probable substitutes of a word instance as its contextual features.",
        "The following examples illustrate how such paradigmatic (sub- stitute based) contextual features can capture the similarity between two contexts where a syntagmatic (neighbor based) representation would fail: 1 NN, VB and VBP are three POS tags from the Penn Treebank corpus and they correspond to singular noun, verb in base form and non-3 rd person singular verb in present tense, respectively.",

        "In our actual experiments our instance based representation distinguishes the instances of offer as noun (cluster 26 and 12) and verb (cluster 35).",

        "The low VM performance of our instance-based model compared to the state-of-the-art word-based systems on some languages is due to the completeness part of the VM score.",
        "The Hinton diagram in Figure 2 shows that large gold-tag groups are split into several clusters based on the substitutability of words in that particular cluster (rows of the Hinton diagram).",
        "For example, proper nouns (NNP) are split into three major clusters such that titles like Mr. or person names are in (40), nationality or country related words like Japanese or U.S are in (22), and the rest of the proper nouns in cluster (30).",
        "The gold-tags of PTB, on the other hand, do not always respect whether words with the same tag are substitutable for one another.",
        "Freudenthal et al. (2005) argues, from the child language acquisition perspective, that the standard linguistic definition of syntactic groups requires the substitutability of words in a syntactic category.",

        "The majority of the (,) instances in cluster 15 are used in relative clauses, reported speech clauses or conjunctions while cluster 43 generally consists of (,) instances that are used in non-essential clauses (ex: Time, the largest newsweekly, .",
