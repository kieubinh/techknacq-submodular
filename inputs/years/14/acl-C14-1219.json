        "and Previous Works Segmentation of the speech stream into lexical units plays a central role in early language acquisition.",
        "Because words are generally not uttered in isolation, one of the first task for infants learning a language is to extract the words that make up the utterances they hear.",
        "Experimental research has shown that infants are able to segment fluent speech into word-like units within the first year of life (Jusczyk and Aslin, 1995).",
        "How does this ability emerge?",
        "There is evidence that infants use a broad array of linguistic cues to perform word segmentation (e.g., phonotactics (Jusczyk et al., 1993a), prosodic information (Jusczyk et al., 1993b), statistical regularities (Saffran et al., 1996)).",
        "Past experimental and modeling research on speech segmentation has mainly focused on linguistic cues, treating them as independent from other non-linguistic cues naturally occurring in the child learning environment.",
        "Yet, language appears in context and is constrained by the events occurring in the daily life of the child.",
        "For example, during an eating event one is most likely to speak about food, while during a zoo-visit event, people are more likely to talk about the animals they see.",
        "Activity contexts may provide a natural structure to speech that would be readily be accessible to children.",
        "A recent study using dense recordings of a single child's language development (Roy et al., 2006) showed that words appearing in specific activity contexts are learned faster (Roy et al., 2012).",
        "Relatedly, Johnson et al. (2010) showed that Adaptor Grammars (AGs) performed better on a segmentation task when the model has access to a hand-annotated set of objects present in the environment, that it can use to learn simultaneously word-object associations (see also (Frank et al., 2009)).",
        "This supports the view that integrating multiple sources of information, linguistic and non-linguistic, can improve learning.",
        "Following this idea, we posit that information from the broader context in which a word has been uttered may simplify the learning problem faced by the child.",
        "In particular, our hypothesis postulates that speech segmentation is easier when using vocabularies that are related to a specific activity (eating, ",
        "2326 Table 1: Most probable words in the 7 final topics egg book ball truck name color block apple shape cat car school bear battery banana square hat fire time crayon minute milk circle tree piece today hair phone butter triangle fish train day head puzzle ?food ?shapes ?playing ?toys ?time ?drawing ?garbage?",
        "playing...), or place (kitchen, bedroom...).",
        "To evaluate this hypothesis, we applied topic modeling (Blei et al., 2003) to automatically derive activity contexts on a corpus of child directed speech, the Providence corpus (Demuth et al., 2006), and tested the influence of such topics on a word segmentation task extending the AG models used in (B?orschinger et al., 2012).",
        "We found that a model augmented with the assumption that words are dependent upon the topic of the discourse (as a proxy for activity context) performs better than the same model without access to the discourse topic.",
        "This suggests that the broader context in which sentences are uttered may help in the word segmentation process, and could presumably be used at various stages of language development.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents a novel approach to augment a corpus with contextual annotations derived from topic models.",
        "Section 3 quickly explains Adaptor Grammars, the framework that we used to express all our models.",
        "Section 4 presents all the models that were used in the results.",
        "Section 5 describes the Providence corpus and the experimental setup.",
        "Section 6 shows our quantitative and qualitative results.",
        "Finally, we discuss the implications for models of language learning.",
        "2 Topics as Proxies for Contexts Roy et al. (2012) found high correlations between human-annotated activity contexts and topics from a latent Dirichlet allocation model (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), thus showing that using topics as proxies for contexts is a sound approach.",
        "Topic modeling infers a topic distribution for each ?document?",
        "(a bag of words) in the corpus.",
        "Since ?documents?",
        "were not annotated in our corpus, we developed the following 3-step approach to automatically segment it into documents.",
        "Firstly, for all the children of the Providence corpus, we used recording sessions as hard document boundaries.",
        "We considered as a ?possible document?",
        "every contiguous sequence of sentences separated by at least 10 seconds of silence, according to the orthographic transcript.",
        "We also identified ?possible documents?",
        "using cues such as ?bye/hi?, indicating a change of participants.",
        "This segmentation resulted in an over-segmented corpus (compared to context switches), yielding a total of 16, 742 documents.",
        "Secondly, we used the gensim software ( ?",
        "Reh?u?rek and Sojka, 2010) to train a topic model (LDA) 1 , and get the topic distributions for each of these documents.",
        "We used the symmetric KL-divergence to measure the distance between two topic distributions before and after a ?possible document?",
        "boundary.",
        "If the distance was above a threshold, we considered this boundary as a document boundary.",
        "Otherwise we merged both ?possible documents?",
        "through this silence.",
        "The threshold was set empirically to discriminate between two topic distributions that correspond to different activity contexts.",
        "After this step, we assume that each of the resulting 8, 634 documents maps to an activity context.",
        "Thirdly, we applied LDA again on this new segmentation to get the topic distribution, hence the activity context, of each document.",
        "The number of topics is qualitatively chosen to correspond to the number of main activity contexts (eating / playing / drawing / etc.)",
        "that occur in the Providence dataset (we used 7 topics), the resulting most topic specific words are shown in Table 1.",
        "Finally, for each document, we got a distribution on topics, and we annotated the document with the most probable topic.",
        "By doing that, we throw away graded information about the distribution on topics for each document.",
        "We could make use of the full distribution, but here we are only interested in the most probable topic as a proxy for activity context.",
        "We do not posit that the infants learn the topic models on linguistic cues while bootstrapping speech and segmentation, but rather that they get activity context from non-linguistic cues.",
        "1 We did LDA only on nouns (as they contain most of the semantics), weighted by TF-IDF.",
