        "The task of relation classification is to predict semantic relations between pairs of nominals and can be defined as follows: given a sentence S with the annotated pairs of nominals e 1 and e 2 , we aim to identify the relations between e 1 and e 2 (Hendrickx et al., 2010).",
        "There is considerable interest in automatic relation classification, both as an end in itself and as an intermediate step in a variety of NLP applications.",
        "The most representative methods for relation classification use supervised paradigm; such methods have been shown to be effective and yield relatively high performance (Zelenko et al., 2003; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Zhou et al., 2005; Mintz et al., 2009).",
        "Supervised approaches are further divided into feature-based methods and kernel-based methods.",
        "Feature-based methods use a set of features that are selected after performing textual analysis.",
        "They convert these features into symbolic IDs, which are then transformed into a vector using a paradigm that is similar to the bag-of-words model 2 .",
        "Conversely, kernel-based methods require pre-processed input data in the form of parse trees (such as dependency parse trees).",
        "These approaches are effective because they leverage a large body of linguistic knowledge.",
        "However, the extracted features or elaborately designed kernels are often derived from the output of pre-existing NLP systems, which leads to the propagation of the errors in the existing tools and hinders the performance of such systems (Bach and Badaskar, 2007).",
        "It is attractive to consider extracting features that are as independent from existing NLP tools as possible.",
        "To identify the relations between pairs of nominals, it is necessary to a skillfully combine lexical and sentence level clues from diverse syntactic and semantic structures in a sentence.",
        "1 A word embedding is a distributed representation for a word.",
        "For example, Collobert et al. (2011) use a 50-dimensional vector to represent a word.",
        "2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words model 2335 Cause-Effect relationship, we usually leverage the marked nouns and the meanings of the entire sentence.",
        "In this paper, we exploit a convolutional DNN to extract lexical and sentence level features for relation classification.",
        "Our method takes all of the word tokens as input without complicated pre-processing, such as Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging and syntactic parsing.",
        "First, all the word tokens are transformed into vectors by looking up word embeddings.",
        "Then, lexical level features are extracted according to the given nouns.",
        "Meanwhile, sentence level features are learned using a convolutional approach.",
        "These two level features are concatenated to form the final extracted feature vector.",
        "Finally, the features are feed into a softmax classifier to predict the relationship between two marked nouns.",
        "The idea of extracting features for NLP using convolutional DNN was previously explored by Collobert et al. (2011), in the context of POS tagging, chunking (CHUNK), Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Semantic Role Labeling (SRL).",
        "Our work shares similar intuition with that of Collobert et al. (2011).",
        "In (Collobert et al., 2011), all of the tasks are considered as the sequential labeling problems in which each word in the input sentence is given a tag.",
        "However, our task, ?relation classification?, can be considered a multi-class classification problem, which results in a different objective function.",
        "Moreover, relation classification is defined as assigning relation labels to pairs of words.",
        "It is thus necessary to specify which pairs of words to which we expect to assign relation labels.",
        "For that purpose, the position features (PF) are exploited to encode the relative distances to the target noun pairs.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first example of using a convolutional DNN for relation classification.",
        "The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows.",

        "We explore the feasibility of performing relation classification without complicated NLP preprocessing.",
        "A convolutional DNN is employed to extract lexical and sentence level features.",
        "?",
        "To specify pairs of words to which relation labels should be assigned, position features are proposed to encode the relative distances to the target noun pairs in the convolutional DNN.",
        "?",
        "We conduct experiments using the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset.",
        "The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed position features are critical for relation classification.",
        "The extracted lexical and sentence level features are effective for relation classification.",
        "Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",
        "2 Related Work Relation classification is one of the most important topics in NLP.",
        "Many approaches have been explored for relation classification, including unsupervised relation discovery and supervised classification.",
        "Researchers have proposed various features to identify the relations between nominals using different methods.",
        "In the unsupervised paradigms, contextual features are used.",
        "Distributional hypothesis theory (Harris, 1954) indicates that words that occur in the same context tend to have similar meanings.",
        "Accordingly, it is assumed that the pairs of nominals that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar relations.",
        "Hasegawa et al. (2004) adopted a hierarchical clustering method to cluster the contexts of nominals and simply selected the most frequent words in the contexts to represent the relation between the nominals.",
        "Chen et al. (2005) proposed a novel unsupervised method based on model order selection and discriminative label identification to address this problem.",
        "In the supervised paradigm, relation classification is considered a multi-classification problem, and researchers concentrate on extracting more complex features.",
        "Generally, these methods can be categorized into two types: feature-based and kernel-based.",
        "In feature-based methods, a diverse set of strategies have been exploited to convert the classification clues (such as sequences and parse trees) into feature vectors (Kambhatla, 2004; Suchanek et al., 2006).",
        "Feature-based methods suffer from the problem of selecting a suitable feature set when converting the structured representation into feature vectors.",
        "Kernel-based methods provide a natural alternative to exploit rich representations of the input classification clues, such as syntactic parse trees.",
        "Kernel-based methods allow the use of a large set of features without explicitly extracting the features.",
        "Various kernels, such as the convolution tree kernel (Qian et 2336 WordRepresentation FeatureExtraction Output W3x Figure 1: Architecture of the neural network used for relation classification.",
        "WindowProcessing max over timesConvolution tanh W2x W1 WF PF Sentence levelFeatures Figure 2: The framework used for extracting sentence level features.",
        "al., 2008), subsequence kernel (Mooney and Bunescu, 2005) and dependency tree kernel (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005), have been proposed to solve the relation classification problem.",
        "However, the methods mentioned above suffer from a lack of sufficient labeled data for training.",
        "Mintz et al. (2009) proposed distant supervision (DS) to address this problem.",
        "The DS method selects sentences that match the facts in a knowledge base as positive examples.",
        "The DS algorithm sometimes faces the problem of wrong labels, which results in noisy labeled data.",
        "To address the shortcoming of DS, Riedel et al. (2010) and Hoffmann et al. (2011) cast the relaxed DS assumption as multi-instance learning.",
        "Furthermore, Taka-matsu et al. (2012) noted that the relaxed DS assumption would fail and proposed a novel generative model to model the heuristic labeling process in order to reduce the wrong labels.",
        "The supervised method has been demonstrated to be effective for relation detection and yields relatively high performance.",
        "However, the performance of this method strongly depends on the quality of the designed features.",
        "With the recent revival of interest in DNN, many researchers have concentrated on using Deep Learning to learn features.",
        "In NLP, such methods are primarily based on learning a distributed representation for each word, which is also called a word embeddings (Turian et al., 2010).",
        "Socher et al. (2012) present a novel recursive neural network (RNN) for relation classification that learns vectors in the syntactic tree path that connects two nominals to determine their semantic relationship.",
        "Hashimoto et al. (2013) also use an RNN for relation classification; their method allows for the explicit weighting of important phrases for the target task.",
        "As mentioned in Section 1, it is difficult to design high quality features using the existing NLP tools.",
        "In this paper, we propose a convolutional DNN to extract lexical and sentence level features for relation classification; our method effectively alleviates the shortcomings of traditional features.",
        "3 Methodology 3.1 The Neural Network Architecture Figure 1 describes the architecture of the neural network that we use for relation classification.",
        "The network takes an input sentence and discovers multiple levels of feature extraction, where higher levels represent more abstract aspects of the inputs.",
        "It primarily includes the following three components: Word Representation, Feature Extraction and Output.",
        "The system does not need any complicated syntactic or semantic preprocessing, and the input of the system is a sentence with two marked nouns.",
        "Then, the word tokens are transformed into vectors by looking up word embeddings.",
        "In succession, the lexical and sentence level features are respectively extracted and then directly concatenated to form the final feature vector.",
        "Finally, to compute the confidence of each relation, the feature vector is fed into a softmax classifier.",
        "The output of the classifier is a vector, the dimension of which is equal to the number of predefined relation types.",
        "The value of each dimension is the confidence score of the corresponding relation.",

        "3.2 Word Representation In the word representation component, each input word token is transformed into a vector by looking up word embeddings.",
        "Collobert et al. (2011) reported that word embeddings learned from significant amounts of unlabeled data are far more satisfactory than the randomly initialized embeddings.",
        "In relation classification, we should first concentrate on learning discriminative word embeddings, which carry more syntactic and semantic information, using significant amounts of unlabeled data.",
        "Unfortunately, it usually takes a long time to train the word embeddings 3 .",
        "However, there are many trained word embeddings that are freely available (Turian et al., 2010).",
        "A comparison of the available word embeddings is beyond the scope of this paper.",
        "Our experiments directly utilize the trained embeddings provided by Turian et al.(2010).",
        "3.3 Lexical Level Features Lexical level features serve as important cues for deciding relations.",
        "The traditional lexical level features primarily include the nouns themselves, the types of the pairs of nominals and word sequences between the entities, the quality of which strongly depends on the results of existing NLP tools.",
        "Alternatively, this paper uses generic word embeddings as the source of base features.",
        "We select the word embeddings of marked nouns and the context tokens.",
        "Moreover, the WordNet hypernyms 4 are adopted as MVRNN (Socher et al., 2012).",
        "All of these features are concatenated into our lexical level features vector l. Table 1 presents the selected word embeddings that are related to the marked nouns in the sentence.",
        "3.4 Sentence Level Features As mentioned in section 3.2, all of the tokens are represented as word vectors, which have been demonstrated to correlate well with human judgments of word similarity.",
        "Despite their success, single word vector models are severely limited because they do not capture long distance features and semantic com-positionality, the important quality of natural language that allows humans to understand the meanings of a longer expression.",
        "In this section, we propose a max-pooled convolutional neural network to offer sentence level representation and automatically extract sentence level features.",
        "Figure 2 shows the framework for sentence level feature extraction.",
        "In the Window Processing component, each token is further represented as Word Features (WF) and Position Features (PF) (see section 3.4.1 and 3.4.2).",
        "Then, the vector goes through a convolutional component.",
        "Finally, we obtain the sentence level features through a non-linear transformation.",
        "3.4.1 Word Features Distributional hypothesis theory (Harris, 1954) indicates that words that occur in the same context tend to have similar meanings.",
        "To capture this characteristic, the WF combines a word's vector representation and the vector representations of the words in its context.",
        "Assume that we have the following sequence of words.",
        "S : [People] 0 have 1 been 2 moving 3 back 4 into 5 [downtown] 6 The marked nouns are associated with a label y that defines the relation type that the marked pair contains.",
        "Each word is also associated with an index into the word embeddings.",

        "in the sentence S is expressed as [x 2 ,x 3 ,x 4 ].",
        "Similarly, considering the whole sentence, the WF can be represented as follows: {[x s ,x 0 ,x 1 ], [x 0 ,x 1 ,x 2 ], ?",

        ", [x 5 ,x 6 ,x e ]} 5 3.4.2 Position Features Relation classification is a very complex task.",
        "Traditionally, structure features (e.g., the shortest dependency path between nominals) are used to solve this problem (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005).",
        "Apparently, it is not possible to capture such structure information only through WF.",
        "It is necessary to specify which input tokens are the target nouns in the sentence.",
        "For this purpose, PF are proposed for relation classification.",
        "In this paper, the PF is the combination of the relative distances of the current word to w 1 and w 2 .",
        "For example, the relative distances of ?moving?",
        "in sentence S to ?people?",
        "and ?downtown?",
        "are 3 and -3, respectively.",
        "In our method, the relative distances also are mapped to a vector of dimension d e (a hyperparameter); this vector is randomly initialized.",
        "Then, we obtain the distance vectors d 1 and d 2 with respect to the relative distances of the current word to w 1 and w 2 , and PF = [d 1 ,d 2 ].",
        "Combining the WF and PF, the word is represented as [WF,PF] T , which is subsequently fed into the convolution component of the algorithm.",
        "3.4.3 Convolution We will see that the word representation approach can capture contextual information through combinations of vectors in a window.",
        "However, it only produces local features around each word of the sentence.",
        "In relation classification, an input sentence that is marked with target nouns only corresponds to a relation type rather than predicting label for each word.",
        "Thus, it might be necessary to utilize all of the local features and predict a relation globally.",
        "When using neural network, the convolution approach is a natural method to merge all of the features.",

        "Because the distance dimension has little effect on the result (this is not illustrated in Figure 3), we heuristically choose d e = 5.",
        "Finally, the word dimension and learning rate are the same as in Collobert et al. (2011).",

        "5.2 Results of Comparison Experiments To obtain the final performance of our automatically learned features, we select seven approaches as competitors to be compared with our method in Table 3.",
        "The first five competitors are described in Hendrickx et al. (2010), all of which use traditional features and employ SVM or MaxEnt as the classifier.",
        "These systems design a series of features and take advantage of a variety of resources (WordNet, ProBank, and FrameNet, for example).",

        "This method learns vectors in the syntactic tree path that connect two nominals to determine their semantic relationship.",
        "The MVRNN model builds a single compositional semantics for the minimal constituent, including both nominals as RNN (Socher et al., 2012).",
        "It is almost certainly too much to expect a single fixed transformation to be able to capture the meaning combination effects of all natural language operators.",
        "Thus, MVRNN assigns a matrix to every word and modifies the meanings of other words instead of only considering word embeddings in the recursive procedure.",
        "Table 3 illustrates the macro-averaged F1 measure results for these competing methods along with the resources, features and classifier used by each method.",
        "Based on these results, we make the following observations: (1) Richer feature sets lead to better performance when using traditional features.",
        "This improvement can be explained by the need for semantic generalization from training to test data.",
        "The quality of traditional features relies on human ingenuity and prior NLP knowledge.",
        "It is almost impossible to manually choose the best feature sets.",
        "(2) RNN and MVRNN contain feature learning procedures; thus, they depend on the syntactic tree used in the recursive procedures.",
        "Errors in syntactic parsing inhibit the ability of these methods to learn high quality features.",
        "RNN cannot achieve a higher performance than the best method that uses traditional features, even when POS, NER and WordNet are added to the training dataset.",
        "Compared with RNN, the MVRNN model can capture the meaning combination effectively and achieve a higher performance.",
