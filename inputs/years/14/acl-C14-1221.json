        "Abstract",
        "Most of the recent literature on Sentiment Analysis over Twitter is tied to the idea that the sentiment is a function of an incoming tweet.",
        "However, tweets are filtered through streams of posts, so that a wider context, e.g. a topic, is always available.",
        "In this work, the contribution of this contextual information is investigated.",
        "We modeled the polarity detection problem as a sequential classification task over streams of tweets.",
        "A Markovian formulation of the Support Vector Machine discriminative model as embodied by the SVM hmm algorithm has been here employed to assign the sentiment polarity to entire sequences.",
        "The experimental evaluation proves that sequential tagging effectively embodies evidence about the contexts and is able to reach a relative increment in detection accuracy of around 20% in F1 measure.",
        "These results are particularly interesting as the approach is flexible and does not require manually coded resources."

        "Since in the Web 2.0 users can write about their life, personal experiences, share contents about facts and ideas, Social Networks became valuable sources of opinions and sentiments.",
        "This huge amount of data is crucial in the study of the interactions and dynamics of subjectivity on the Web, largely relevant for marketing tasks.",
        "Twitter is one among these microblogging services that counts about a billion of active users and 500 million of daily messages 1 .",
        "However, the analysis of this huge amount of information is still challenging, as language is very informal, affected by misspelling and characterized by slang and #hashtags, i.e. special user-generated tags used to contextualize different tweets around a specific topic.",
        "Researches focused on the computational study and automatic recognition of opinions and sentiments as they are expressed in free texts.",
        "It gave rise to what is currently known as Sentiment Analysis, a set of tasks aiming to detect the subjective attitude of a writer with respect to some topic.",
        "Many Sentiment Analysis studies map sentiment detection in a Machine Learning (ML) setting (Pang and Lee, 2008), where labeled data, i.e. known examples, allow to induce the detection function from real world examples.",
        "In general, sentiment detection in tweets has been generally treated as any other text classification task, as proved by most papers participating to the Sentiment Analysis in Twitter task in SemEval-2013 challenge (Nakov et al., 2013): a computational representation for an incoming instance is generated by just considering one tweet at a time.",
        "The short length of the message and the resulting semantic ambiguity are critical limitations and make the task very complex.",
        "Let us consider the following example, in which a tweet from ColMustard cites SergGray: ColMustard : @SergGray Yes, I totally agree with you about the substitutions!",
        "#Bayern #Freiburg The tweet sounds like to be a reply to the previous one.",
        "Notice how no lexical nor syntactic property allows to determine the sentiment polarity.",
        "However, if we look at the entire conversation that follows: ColMustard : Amazing match yesterday!",
        "!#Bayern vs. #Freiburg 4-0 #easyvictory SergGray : @ColMustard Surely, but #Freiburg wasted lot of chances to score.. wrong substitutions by #Guardiola during the 2nd half!!",
        "ColMustard : @SergGray Yes, I totally agree with you about the substitutions!",
        "#Bayern #Freiburg This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "1 http://expandedramblings.com/ 2345 it is easy to establish that a first positive tweet has been produced, followed by a second negative one so that the third tweet is negative as well.",
        "It is the conversation that allows us here to disambiguate even a very short message and properly characterize it according to its author and posting time.",
        "We want here to capitalize such a richer set of observations (i.e. entire conversations) and to define a context-sensitive SA model along two lines: first, by enriching a tweet representation to include the conversation information, and then introducing a more complex classification model that works over an entire tweet sequence and not on one tweet (i.e. the target) at a time.",
        "Accordingly, in the paper we will first focus on different representations of tweets that can be made available to the sentiment detection process.",
        "They will also account for contexts, that are conversations, as chains of tweets that are reply to the previous ones, and topics, built around hashtags.",
        "These are in fact topics made explicit by users, such as events (#easyvictory) or people (#Guardiola).",
        "It represents a wider notion of conversation that enforces the sense of belonging to a community.",
        "From a computational perspective, the polarity detection of a tweet in a context is here modeled as a sequential classification task.",
        "In fact, both conversation and topic-based context are arbitrarily long sequences of messages, ordered according to time with the target tweet being the last.",
        "The SVM hmm learning algorithm (Altun et al., 2003) has been employed, as it allows to classify an instance (here, a tweet) within an entire sequence.",
        "While SVM based classifiers allow to recognize the sentiments from one specific tweet at a time, the SVM hmm learning algorithm collectively labels all tweets in a sequence.",
        "It is thus expected to capture patterns within a conversation and apply them in novel sequences, through a standard decoding task.",
        "While all the above contexts extend a tweet representation, they are still local to a specific notion of conversation.",
        "In this work, we also explore the somehow more abstract notion of contexts given by the emotional attitude shown by each user in his overall usage of Twitter.",
        "In the above example, ColMustard shows a specific attitude while discussing about the Bayern Munchen.",
        "We can imagine that this feature characterizes most of its future messages at least about football.",
        "We suggest to enrich the tweet representation with features that synthesize a user's profile, in order to catch possible biases towards a particular sentiment polarity.",
        "This is quite interesting as it has been shown that communities behave in a coherent way and users tend to take stable standing points.",
        "Experimental evaluation (Chapter 4) proves the effectiveness of this proposed sequential tagging approach combined with the adopted contextual information, improving the percentage of correctly recognized tweets up to 12%.",
        "A survey of the existing approaches is presented into Section 2.",
        "Then, Section 3 provides an account of the context-based models: conversation, topic-based and user sentiment profiling.",
        "The experimental evaluation into Section 4 prove the positive impact of social dynamics on the SA task.",
        "2 Related Work Sentiment Analysis has been described as a Natural Language Processing task at many levels of granularity.",
        "Starting from being mapped into a document level classification task (Turney, 2002; Pang and Lee, 2004), it has been also applied at sentence level (Hu and Liu, 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004) and more recently at the phrase level (Wilson et al., 2005; Agarwal et al., 2009).",
        "The spreading of microblog services where users post real-time opinions about ?everything?, poses newer and different challenges.",
        "Indeed, classical approaches to Sentiment Analysis (Pang et al., 2002; Pang and Lee, 2008) are not directly applicable to tweets: while most of them focus on relatively large texts, e.g. movie or product reviews, tweets are very short and fine-grained lexical analysis is required.",
        "Nevertheless, the great prominence of Social Media during the last few years encouraged a focus on the sentiment detection over a microblogging domain.",
        "Recent works tried to model the sentiment in tweets (Go et al., 2009; Pak and Paroubek, 2010; Kouloumpis et al., 2011; Davidov et al., 2010; Bifet and Frank, 2010; Croce and Basili, 2012; Barbosa and Feng, 2010; Zanzotto et al., 2011; Si et al., 2013; Agarwal et al., 2011).",
        "Specific approaches and feature modeling are used to improve accuracy levels in tweet polarity recognition.",
        "For example, the use of n-grams, POS tags, polarity lexicons and tweet specific features (e.g. hashtags, re-tweets) are some of the component exploited by these works, in combination with different machine learning algorithms: among these latter, probabilistic paradigms, e.g.",
        "Naive Bayes (Pak and Paroubek, 2010), or Kernel-based machines, as discussed in (Barbosa and Feng, 2346 2010; Agarwal et al., 2011; Castellucci et al., 2013), are mostly employed.",
        "An interesting perspective, where a kind of contextual information is studied, is presented in (Mukherjee and Bhattacharyya, 2012): the sentiment detection of tweets is here modeled according to lexical features as well as discourse relations like the presence of connectives, conditionals and semantic operators like modals and negations.",
        "Nevertheless, in all the above approaches, features are derived only from lexical resources or from the tweet itself and no contextual information is exploited.",
        "However, given one tweet targeted for sentiment detection, more awareness about its content is available to writers and readers by the entire stream of related posts immediately preceding it.",
        "In order to exploit this wider information, a Markovian extension of a Kernel-based categorization approach is proposed in the next section.",
        "3 A context based model for Sentiment Analysis in Twitter As discussed in the introduction, contextual information about one tweet stems from various aspects: an explicit conversation, the user attitude or the overall set of recent tweets about a topic (for example an hastag like #Bayern).",
        "As individual perspectives on the context are independent (a conversation may or may not depend on user preference or cheer) and they also obey to different notion of analogies or similarity, we should avoid a unified feature vector, but employ independent representations.",
        "A structured view on a tweet can thus be provided by considering it as multifaceted entity where a set of vectors, each one contributing to one aspect of the overall representation, exhibits a specific similarity metrics.",
        "Notice how this is exactly what Kernel-based learning supports, whereas the combination of the different Kernel functions can be easily made a Kernel function itself (Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004).",
        "Kernel functions are used to capture specific aspects of the semantic relatedness between two tweets and are easily integrated in various Machine Learning algorithms, such as SVM.",
        "3.1 Representing tweets through different Kernel functions Many Machine Learning approaches for Sentiment Analysis in Twitter benefited by complex ways of modeling of individual tweets, as discussed in many works (Nakov et al., 2013).",
        "The representation we propose makes use of individual Kernels as models of different aspects usable within a SVM paradigm.",
        "Bag of Word Kernel (BoWK).",
        "The simplest Kernel function describes the lexical overlap between tweets, thus represented as vectors, whose dimensions correspond to the different words.",
        "Components denote the presence or not of the corresponding word in the text and Kernel function corresponds to the cosine similarity between vector pairs.",
        "Even if very simple, the BoW model is one of the most informative representation in Sentiment Analysis, as emphasized since (Pang et al., 2002).",
        "Lexical Semantic Kernel (LSK).",
        "Lexical information in tweets can be very sparse, as we will also show in the next Section 4.",
        "In order to extend the BoW model, we provide a further vector representation aiming to generalize the lexical information.",
        "It can be obtained for every term of a dictionary by a co-occurrence Word Space built according to the Distributional Analysis described in (Sahlgren, 2006).",
        "A word-by-context matrix, M , is built through large scale corpus analysis and then processed through Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer and Dumais, 1997).",
        "The dimensionality of the space represented by M can be reduced through Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) (Golub and Kahan, 1965).",
        "The original statistical information about M is captured by the new k-dimensional space, which preserves the global structure while removing low-variance dimensions, i.e. distribution noise.",
        "The result is that every word is projected in the reduced Word Space and a vector for each tweet is represented through the linear combination of the co-occurring word vectors (also called additive linear combination in (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010)).",
        "The resulting Kernel function is the cosine similarity between tweet vector pairs, in line with (Cristianini et al., 2002).",
        "Notice that the adoption of a distributional approach does not limit the overall application, as it can be automatically applied without relying on any manually coded resource.",
        "User Sentiment Profile Context (USPK).",
        "A source of evidence about a tweet is its author, with his attitude towards some polarities.",
        "Specific features based on the users?",
        "previous tweets can be derived as follows.",
        "Let t i ?",

        "The User Profile Context (U i ) can be defined as the set of the lastH tweets posted by the author of t i , hereafter denoted by u i .",
        "This information is a body of evidence about the opinion holder's profile on which a further tweet representation can be defined.",

        "m ).",
        "The multiple Kernel approach.",
        "Whenever the different Kernels are available, we can apply a linear combination ?BoWK+?LSK or ?BoWK+?LSK+?USPK in order to exploit lexical and semantic properties captured by BoWK and LSK, or user properties as captured by USPK.",
        "3.2 Modeling tweet conversation as a sequential tagging problem The User Sentiment Profile Kernel (UPSK) can be seen as an implicit representation of a context describing the writer.",
        "However, contextual information is usually embodied by the stream of tweets in which the target one t i is immersed.",
        "Usually, the stream is something available to a reader and includes an entire conversation (where links to the previous tweets are made explicit and are supposed to be all available) or a topic, i.e. a hashtag, the reader has searched for.",
        "In all cases, the stream give rise to an entire sequence on which sequence labeling can be applied: the target tweet is here always labeled within the entire sequence, where contextual constraints are provided by the preceding tweets.",
        "More formally, two types of context are defined: Conversational context.",
        "For every tweet t i ?",
        "T , let r(t i ) : T ?",
        "T be a function that returns either the tweet to which t i is a reply to, or null if t i is not a reply.",
        "Then, the conversation-based context ?",
        "C,l i of tweet t i (i.e., the target tweet) is the sequence of tweet iteratively built by applying r(?",
        "), until l tweets have been selected or r(?)",
        "= null.",
        "In other words, l allows to limit the size of the input context.",
        "An example of conversation-based context is given in Section 1.",
        "Topical context.",
        "Hashtags allow to aggregate different tweets around a specific topic.",
        "An entire tweet sequence can be derived including the n tweets preceding the target t i that contain the same hashtag set.",
        "This is usually the output of a search in Twitter and it is likely the source information that influenced the writer's opinion.",
        "Let t i ?",
        "T be a tweet and h(i) : T ?",
        "P(H) be a function that returns the entire hashtag set H i ?",
        "H observed into t i .",
        "Then, the hashtag-based context ?",
        "H,l i for a tweet t i (i.e., target tweet) is a sequence of the most recent l tweets t j such that H j ?H i 6= ?, i.e. t j and t i share at least one hashtag, and t j has been posted before t i .",
        "As an example, the following hashtag-based context of size 4 has been obtained about #Bayern: MrGreen : Fun fact: #Freiburg is the only #Bundesliga team #Pep has never beaten in his coaching career.",
        "#Bayern MrsPeacock : Young starlet Xherdan #Shaqiri fires #Bayern into a 2-0 lead.",

        "I cant believe what #Bayern did!",
        "It is clear that MissScarlet expressed an opinion, but the corresponding polarity is easily evident when the entire stream is available about the #Bayern hashtag.",
        "As well as in a conversational context, a specific context size n can be imposed by focusing only on the last n tweets of the sequence.",
        "Once different representations and contexts are available a structured learning-based approach can be applied to Sentiment Analysis.",
        "Firstly, we will discuss a discriminative learning approach that follows the multi-classification schema proposed in (Joachims et al., 2009), namely SVM multiclass .",

        "In these first experiments, user modeling has only been partially explored, whereas the USPK model does not seem very effective.",
        "In fact, USPK seems to express a more static notion of context (i.e. the attitude of the user as observed across a longer period than individual conversations) and two different notions (i.e. information embedded into recent tweets) risk to be incompatible.",
