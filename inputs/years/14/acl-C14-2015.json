        "China's growing global influence has prompted a surge of interest in learning Chinese as a foreign language (CFL), and this trend is expected to continue.",
        "This has driven an increase in demand for automated IT-based tools designed to assist CFL learners in mastering the language, including so-called MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) which allows huge numbers of learners to simultaneously access instructional opportunities and resources.",
        "This, in turn, has driven demand for automatic proofreading techniques to help instructors review and respond to the large volume of assignments and tests submitted by enrolled learners.",
        "However, whereas many computer-assisted learning tools have been developed for use by students of English as a Foreign Language (EFL), support for CFL learners is relatively sparse, especially in terms of tools designed to automatically detect and correct Chinese grammatical errors.",
        "For example, while Microsoft Word has integrated robust English spelling and grammar checking functions for years, such tools for Chinese are still quite primitive.",
        "In contrast to the plethora of research related to EFL learning, relatively few studies have focused on grammar checking for CFL learners.",
        "Wu et al. (2010) proposed relative position and parse template language models to detect Chinese errors written by US learner.",
        "Yu and Chen (2012) proposed a classifier to detect word-ordering errors in Chinese sentences from the HSK dynamic composition corpus.",
        "Chang et al. (2012) proposed a penalized probabilistic First-Order Inductive Learning (pFOIL) algorithm for error diagnosis.",
        "In summary, although there are many approaches and tools to help EFL learners, the research problem described above for CFL learning is still under-explored.",
        "In addition, no common platform is available to compare different approaches and to promote the study of this important issue.",
        "This study develops a sentence judgment system using both rule-based and n-gram statistical methods to detect grammatical errors in sentences written by CFL learners.",
        "Learners can input Chinese sentences into the proposed system to check for possible grammatical errors.",

        "means an exclusion from the previous representation, with ?N*-Nab-Nbc?",
        "indicating that the corresponding word should be any noun (N*) excluding countable entity nouns (Nab) and surnames (Nbc).",
        "(3) ?/?",
        "means an alternative (i.e., ?or?",
        "), where the expression ???/??/???",
        "(some/these/those) indicates that one of these three words satisfies the rule.",
        "(4) The rule mx{W1 W2} denotes the mutual exclusivity of the two words W1 and W2.",
        "(5) ?<?",
        "denotes the follow-by condition, where the expression ?Nhb < Nep?",
        "means the POS-tag ?Nep?",
        "follows the tag ?Nhb?",
        "that can exist several words ahead of the ?Nep?.",
        "Using such rule symbols, we manually constructed syntactic rules to cover errors that frequently occur in sentences written by CFL learners.",
        "We adopted the ?Analysis of 900 Common Erroneous Samples of Chinese Sentences?",
        "(Cheng, 1997) as the development set to handcraft the linguistic rules with syntactic information.",
        "If an input sentence satisfies any syntactic rule, the system will report the input as suspected of containing grammatical errors, creating a useful tool for autonomous CFL learners.",
        "2.3 N-gram Statistical Analysis Language modeling approaches to grammatical error detection are usually based on a score (log prob-ability) output by an n-gram model trained on a large corpus.",
        "A sentence with grammatical errors usually has a low n-gram score.",
        "However, choosing an appropriate threshold to determine whether a sentence is correct is still a nontrivial task.",
        "Therefore, this study proposes the use of n-gram scores of correct and incorrect sentences to build the respective correct and incorrect statistical models for grammatical error detection.",
        "That is, a given sentence is denoted as incorrect (i.e., having grammatical er-rors) if its probability score output by the statistical model of incorrect sentences (i.e., the incorrect model) is greater than that of correct sentences (i.e., the correct model).",
        "To build the incorrect and correct statistical models, a total of 19,080 sentences with grammatical errors were extracted from the HSK dynamic composition corpus.",
        "These sentences were then manually corrected.",
        "An n-gram (n= 2 and 3) language model was then built from the Sinica corpus released by the Association for Computational Linguistics and Chinese Language Processing (ACLCLP) using the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).",
        "The trained language model was used to assign an n?gram score for each correct and incorrect sentence, which were then used to build the respective correct and incorrect models based on a normal probability density function (Manning and Schütze, 1999).",
        "Both models can then be used to evaluate each test sentence by transforming its n-gram score into a probability score to determine whether the sentence is correct or not.",
        "3 Performance Evaluation The test set included 880 sentences with grammatical errors generated by CSL learners in the NCKU Chinese Language Center, and the corresponding 880 manually corrected sentences.",
        "For the rule-based approach, a total of 142 rules were developed to identify incorrect sentences.",
        "For the n-gram statistical approach, both bi-gram and tri-gram language models were used for the correct and incorrect statistical models.",
        "In addition to precision, recall, and F1, the false positive rate (FPR) was defined as the number of correct sentences incorrectly identified as incorrect sentences divided by the total number of correct sentences in the test set.",
        "Table 1 shows the comparative results of the rule-based and n-gram statistical approaches to grammatical error detection.",
        "The results show that the rule-based approach achieved high precision, low recall and low FPR.",
        "Conversely, the n-gram-based approach yielded low precision, high recall and high FPR.",
        "In addition, the tri-gram model outperformed the bi-gram model for all metrics.",
        "Given the different results yielded by the rule-based and n-gram statistical approaches, we present different combinations of these two methods for comparison.",
        "The ?OR?",
        "combination means that a given sentence is identified as incorrect by only one of the methods, while the ?AND?",
        "combination means that a given sentence is identified as incorrect by both methods.",
        "The results show that the ?OR?",
        "combination yielded better recall than the individual methods, and the ?AND?",
        "combination yielded better precision and FPR than the individual methods.",
        "Thus, the choice of methods may depend on application requirements or preferences 69 Method Precision Recall F1 False Positive Rate Rule 0.857 0.224 0.356 0.038 2-gram 0.555 0.751 0.638 0.603 3-gram 0.585 0.838 0.689 0.595 Rule OR 2-gram 0.500 1.000 0.667 1.000 Rule OR 3-gram 0.502 1.000 0.668 0.993 Rule AND 2-gram 0.924 0.083 0.153 0.007 Rule AND 3-gram 0.924 0.083 0.153 0.007 Table 1.",

        "Many learner corpora exist for EFL for use in machine learning, including the International Corpus of Learner English (ICLE) and Cambridge Learner Corpus (CLC).",
        "But collecting a representative sample of authentic errors from CFL learners poses a challenge.",
        "In addition, English and Chinese grammars are markedly different.",
        "In contrast to syntax-oriented English language, Chinese is dis-course-oriented, with meaning often expressed in several clauses to make a complete sentence.",
        "These characteristics make syntactic parsing difficult, due to long dependency between words in a clause or across clauses in a sentence.",
        "These difficulties constrain system performance.",
        "4 Conclusions This study presents a sentence judgment system developed using both rule-based and n-gram statistical methods to detect grammatical errors in sentences written by CFL learners.",
        "The system not only alerts learners to potential grammatical errors in their input sentences, but also helps them learn about linguistic rules and n-gram frequencies.",
        "The major contributions of this work include: (a) demonstrat-ingg the feasibility of detecting grammatical errors in sentences written by CFL learners, (b) developing a system to facilitate autonomous learning among CFL learners and (c) collecting real grammatical errors from CFL learners for the construction of a Chinese learner corpus.",
