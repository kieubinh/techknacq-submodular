        "Reliability is a necessary precondition for obtaining high-quality datasets and thus for drawing valid conclusions from an annotation study.",
        "Assessing the reliability by means of inter-rater agreement measures has been an established scientific practice in psychology (e.g., Cohen, 1960), medicine (Cicchetti et al., 1978), and content analysis (Krippendorff, 1980) for decades.",
        "In the computational linguistics and natural language processing community, reliability discussions have long been limited or completely ignored.",
        "It was not until Carletta's (1996) appeal that researchers started measuring the inter-rater agreement at a larger scale.",
        "However, there are still numerous papers published every year that lack a proper discussion of data quality.",
        "The reliability of the utilized datasets is, for example, not discussed at all in six out of the thirteen task description papers of SemEval-2013, and it remains shallow in another four papers, which do not provide a suitable inter-rater agreement figure.",
        "1 A major reason for this is the limited availability of software components, which support the standard measures and are well-integrated with existing systems.",
        "In fact, many researchers currently rely on manual calculations, hasty implementations of single coefficients, or free online calculators that often lack documentation of the implementation details.",
        "In this work, we present the novel Java-based software library DKPro Agreement for computing multiple inter-rater agreement measures using a shared interface and data model.",
        "For the first time, we provide a unified model for analyzing coding (i.e., assigning categories to fixed items) and unitizing studies (i.e., segmenting the data into codable units).",
        "By supporting these two fundamental annotation setups, our software can be used for analyzing many different annotation tasks including syntactic (e.g., part-of-speech tagging), semantic (e.g., word sense assignment, keyphrase identification), and discourse annotation tasks (e.g., dialogue act tagging).",
        "We particularly provide diagnostic devices for analyzing systematic disagreement, which is often overlooked in reliability discussions.",
        "DKPro Agreement is available as open-source software, thoroughly tested on a wide range of examples, and well-documented for getting started quickly.",
        "2 Our implementation is targeted at scientists and software developers working in Java, including the large communities around the major Java-based toolkits OpenNLP, DKPro, and GATE.",
        "3 The software integrates more easily with existing Java applications than statistics software such as Octave, R, or SPSS, and its usage requires a less pronounced statistics background.",
        "1 All SemEval task descriptions (http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2013) have been discussed among the authors.",
        "2 DKPro Agreement is part of the DKPro Statistics library.",
        "The project is available from https://code.google.com/p/ dkpro-statistics/ and licensed under the Apache License 2.0.",
        "3http://opennlp.apache.org, http://code.google.com/p/dkpro-core-asl, http://gate.ac.uk 105 2 Related Work Reliability is the subject of an extensive body of literature.",
        "Artstein and Poesio (2008) and Krippendorff (1980) give a general introduction to this topic.",
        "Implementations of inter-rater agreement measures exist both as stand-alone and as online tools (e.g., http://uni-leipzig.de/?jenderek/tool/ tool.htm, http://terpconnect.umd.edu/?dchoy/thesis/Kappa).",
        "Most of them focus on one type of agreement measure (e.g., http://vassarstats.net/kappa.html and Randolph (2005) for ?",
        "as well as http://ron.artstein.org/software.html for ?).",
        "Others are limited to a few different measures (e.g., https://mlnl.net/jg/software/ira and http://dfreelon.org/utils/recalfront/recal3).",
        "Frameworks offering a wider range of measures are either commercial with a high price tag (e.g., http://www.medcalc.org/manual/kappa.php) or limited to specific platforms (e.g., http://www.",
        "agreestat.com/agreestat.html).",
        "The situation is even worse for unitizing studies, for which we are only aware of Perry and Krippendorff's (2013) implementation available at http://www.gabriela.",
        "trindade.nom.br/2013/02/calculating-alpha-d-and-alpha-u/.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, there is no software library providing a large variety of agreement measures and diagnostic devices, which covers both coding and unitizing studies and which integrates well with existing systems.",
        "3 Implementation The standard workflow for using DKPro Agreement is (1) representing the annotated data using our unified data model, (2) measuring the agreement among the individual raters, and (3) analyzing the results using diagnostic devices and visualizations.",
        "Data model.",
        "We provide the Java interface IAnnotationStudy as the basic representation of the annotated data.",
        "An annotation study consists of a set of raters, a set of codable units, and a set of categories, which may be used by the raters to code a unit.",
        "The categories do not have a specific type, such that any Java object (including integers and enums) may be used without any extensions.",
        "Following Krippendorff's (1980) terminology, we distinguish two basic annotation setups: In coding studies, the raters receive a set of annotation items with fixed boundaries (e.g., full articles from a newspaper), which each of them should code (?annotate?)",
        "with one of the categories (e.g., politics, eco-nomics).",
        "We consider each rater's annotation of an item a single annotation unit.",
        "In unitizing studies, the raters are asked to identify the annotation units themselves by marking their boundaries (e.g., highlighting key phrases).",
        "Depending on the task definition, the identified units may be coded with one of multiple categories or just distinguish identified segments from so-called gaps between these segments.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates this data model for both setups.",
        "The framed boxes show the annotation units and the categories assigned to them.",
        "In coding studies, the units with identical index (i.e., the columns) yield the annotation items.",
        "In unitizing studies, the units may be positioned arbitrarily within the continuum.",
        "We represent missing annotations as empty boxes (coding studies) and as horizontal lines between the identified units (unitizing studies).",
        "Software developers can either instantiate our default implementation (e.g., by reading data from flat files or databases) or implement the provided Java interfaces in order to reuse their own data model.",
        "For coding studies, there is an addItem method with a varargs parameter (i.e., a method taking an arbitrary number of parameters) for specifying the annotation of each rater for a certain item.",
        "The line study.addItem(\"B\", \"C\", null, \"B\") indicates that four raters coded an item with the categories B, C, null, and B. We use null to represent missing annotations.",
        "Similarly, unitizing studies provide an addUnit method, which takes the boundaries and the category assigned to the unit by a certain rater.",
        "The line study.addUnit(10, 4, 2, \"A\") indicates, for instance, a unit of length 4, which starts at position 10 and which has been annotated as category A by rater 2.",
        "Coding measures.",
        "Table 1 shows an overview of the inter-rater agreement measures currently available in DKPro Agreement.",
        "Artstein and Poesio (2008) give an overview of these measures.",
        "While the percentage agreement simply divides the number of agreements by the item count, all other measures perform a chance correction.",

        "We provide distance functions for nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales (Krippendorff, 1980), as well as the MASI distance function for set-valued data (Passonneau, 2006).",
        "Set annotations are an example for a more complex type of category, as they facilitate assigning multiple categories to a given unit.",
        "Additionally, researchers can easily define new study-specific distance functions.",
        "Unitizing measures.",
        "Although unitizing has long been identified as a major issue of reliability analysis (cf. Auld and Whitea, 1956), there are so far only few formalizations.",
        "The most elaborate measure is Krippendorff's ?",
        "U (1995), which is based on a distance function for comparing units with identical, overlapping, or disjoint boundaries.",

        "Due to the lack of implementations and the complex statistics, ?",
        "U is almost never reported in the literature.",
        "While our implementation follows the original definition, it does not require to explicitly encode the gaps, because we generate them automatically.",
        "This simplifies the usage of this measure substantially, since, for example, UIMA 4 annotations can be directly used to represent the annotation units.",
        "While the original definition focuses on only one category, we additionally support Krippendorff's later definition of an aggregating ?",
        "U over all categories (Krippendorff, 2004).",
        "Analysis.",
        "The raw inter-rater agreement scores are useful for comparing multiple annotation studies with each other, but they are of limited help for diagnosing disagreement and potential systematic issues with certain categories, items, or raters.",
        "This is why we provide interfaces for measuring the agreement of a specific category, item, or rater.",
        "Fleiss (1971) defines, for instance, a category-specific ?",

        "Besides measuring a rater-specific agreement score, DKPro Agreement facilitates the computation of pairwise inter-rater agreement in order to identify the pair of raters with the highest and lowest agreement.",
        "Finally, each measure can return some of its intermediate results, for example, the expected agreement P e of Scott's pi (1955).",
        "Another means of analysis is to display the annotation units and the disagreement among the raters.",
        "Coding studies can be displayed as a coincidence table or as a reliability matrix (Krippendorff, 1980).",
        "For studies with two raters, our software also allows printing a contingency table.",
