        "Distributional semantic models (DSMs) represent the meaning of a target term (which can be a word form, lemma, morpheme, word pair, etc.)",
        "in the form of a feature vector that records either co-occurrence frequencies of the target term with a set of feature terms (term-term model) or its distribution across text units (term-context model).",
        "Such DSMs have become an indispensable ingredient in many NLP applications that require flexible broad-coverage lexical semantics (Turney and Pantel, 2010).",
        "Distributional modelling is an empirical science.",
        "DSM representations are determined by a wide range of parameters such as size and type of the co-occurrence context, feature selection, weighting of co-occurrence frequencies (often with statistical association measures), distance metric, dimensionality reduction method and the number of latent dimensions used.",
        "Despite recent efforts to carry out systematic evaluation studies (Bullinaria and Levy, 2007; Bullinaria and Levy, 2012), the precise effects of these parameters and their relevance for different application settings are still poorly understood.",
        "The wordspace package for Gnu R (R Development Core Team, 2010) aims to provide a flexible, powerful and easy to use ?interactive laboratory?",
        "that enables its users to build DSMs and experiment with them, but that also scales up to the large models required by real-life applications.",
        "2 Related work One reason for the popularity of distributional approaches is that even large-scale models can be implemented with relative ease.",
        "In the geometric interpretation, most operations involved in building and using a DSM can be expressed concisely in terms of matrix and vector algebra: matrix multiplication, inner and outer products, matrix decomposition, and vector norms and metrics.",
        "In order to make DSMs accessible to a large group of users, several dedicated software packages have been developed.",
        "Most of these packages either implement a particular model, limiting their flexibility, or impose a complex framework of classes, making it hard for users to carry out operations not envisioned by the package developers.",
        "Examples of the first category are HiDeX (Shaoul and Westbury, 2010), a modern reimplementation of the HAL model, and Semantic Vectors (Widdows and Cohen, 2010), which enforces a random indexing representation in order to improve scalability.",
        "A typical example of the second category is the S-Space package (Jurgens and Stevens, 2010), which defines a complete pipeline for building and evaluating a DSM; researchers wishing e.g. to evaluate the model on a different task need to implement the evaluation procedure in the form of a suitable Java class.",
        "Two Python-based software packages in this category are Gensim ( ?",
        "Reh?u?rek and Sojka, 2010) and DISSECT (Dinu et al., 2013), which has a particular focus on learning compositional models.",
        "110 In order to avoid locking its users into a particular framework or class of distributional model, the wordspace package takes a different approach.",
        "It builds on the statistical software environment Gnu R, which provides efficient dense and sparse matrix algebra, sophisticated statistical analysis and visual-ization, as well as numerous machine learning methods as part of its core library and through a wealth of add-on packages.",
        "R itself is already an excellent environment for the interactive exploration of DSMs.",
        "Like many other R packages, wordspace does not define its own complex framework.",
        "It extends functionality that is already available (and easy to use) with a small set of carefully designed functions that (i) encapsulate non-trivial R operations in a convenient and user-friendly way and (ii) provide highly efficient and memory-friendly C implementations of key operations in order to improve scalability.",
        "Of the other DSM software packages available, DISSECT seems closest in spirit to wordspace.",
        "There-fore, it is used as a point of reference for the performance comparison in Sec.",
        "5.",
        "3 The wordspace package The wordspace package is an open-source project distributed under the GNU General Public License.",
        "Since the pacakge is linked to the R interpreter and its functions are always invoked from interpreted code, this does not preclude commercial applications involving closed-source components.",
        "The package source code is hosted on R-Forge.",
        "1 It can easily be installed from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), which provides pre-compiled binaries for Windows and Mac OS X.",
        "3.1 Input formats The most general representation of a distributional model takes the form of a sparse matrix, with entries specified as a triplet of row label (target term), column label (feature term) and co-occurrence frequency (cf. left panel of Fig. 1).",
        "The wordspace package creates DSM objects from such triplet representa-tions, which can easily be imported into R from a wide range of file and database formats.",
        "Ready-made import functions are provided for TAB-delimited text files (as used by DISSECT), which may be compressed to save disk space, and for term-document models from the text-mining framework tm for R. The native input format is a pre-compiled sparse matrix representation generated by the UCS toolkit.",
        "2 In this way, UCS serves as a hub for the preparation of co-occurrence data, which can be collected from dependency pairs, extracted from a corpus indexed with the IMS Corpus Workbench, 3 or imported from various other formats such as the Ngram Statistics Package (NSP).",
        "4 3.2 Features The wordspace package offers flexible convenience functions to filter DSMs by properties of their rows (targets) and columns (features), combine multiple co-occurrence matrices by rows or by columns, and merge data obtained from different corpora.",
        "Co-occurrence frequencies can be weighted by a tf.idf scheme or one of various statistical association measures, rescaled e.g. by a logarithmic transformation, standardized and row-normalized.",
        "Efficient implementations are provided for dimensionality reduction by randomized SVD (Halko et al., 2009) or random indexing, for computing a distance matrix between a set of row vectors, and for the identification of the nearest neighbours of a given target term.",
        "Additional functions compute centroid representations for sentence contexts and support the evaluation of DSMs in standard classification, clustering and regression tasks.",
        "Several freely available gold standard data sets are included in the package.",
        "Due to its philosophy, wordspace only provides essential functionality that cannot easily be achieved with basic R functions or does not scale well in the standard implementation.",
        "Many further analyses and operations (e.g. partial least-squares regression for learning compositional DSMs) can be performed with standard R functions or one of more than 5000 add-on packages available from CRAN.",

        "4854 noun-verb co-occurrence matrix.",
        "Highly sparse vectors are unreliable as indicators of word meaning, so we filter out rows and columns with less than 3 nonzero entries using the subset() method for DSM objects.",
        "The required nonzero counts have automatically been added by the dsm() constructor.",
        "Since deleting rows and columns changes the nonzero counts, we apply the process recursively until both constraints are satisfied (line 9).",
        "Co-occurrence counts are then weighted by the log-likelihood association measure, log-transformed to deskew their distribution, and row vectors are normalized to Euclidean unit length.",
        "This is achieved with a single function call and minimal memory overhead (line 13).",
        "For dimensionality reduction, the efficient randomized SVD algorithm is used (line 15), resulting in a plain R matrix VObj300.",
        "Typical applications of a DSM are to compute distances or cosine similarities between pairs of target terms (line 17) and to find the nearest neighbours of a given term (line 20).",
        "The final DSM can be evaluated e.g. by comparison with the RG65 data set of semantic similarity ratings (Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965).",

        "The commands in lines 31?37 illustrate the use of standard R functions for further analysis and visualization.",
        "Here, an implementation of non-metric multidimensional scaling in the R package MASS produces a semantic map of the nearest neighbours of book.",
        "A slightly more polished version of this plot is shown in the right panel of Fig. 2.",
        "The only step that takes a non-negligible amount of time is dimensionality reduction with randomized SVD (approx.",

        "5 Performance comparison In order to determine the usefulness of the wordspace package for realistically sized data sets, a benchmark was carried out using the W ?W projection of the Distributional Memory tensor (Baroni and Lenci, 2010), resulting in a sparse 30686?",

        "Both sample sets were taken from the WordSim-353 data set.",
        "DISSECT requires about 2.5 GiB RAM to carry out the complete process, while R requires slightly above 4 GiB.",
        "Most of the RAM is needed to load the non-native input format (which happens to be the native format of DISSECT).",
        "For the remaining steps, memory usage remains well below 3 GiB.",
