        "Neural network models have recently experienced unprecedented attention in research on statistical machine translation (SMT).",
        "Several groups have reported strong improvements over state-of-the-art baselines using feedforward neural network-based language models (Schwenk et al., 2006; Vaswani et al., 2013), as well as translation models (Le et al., 2012; Schwenk, 2012; Devlin et al., 2014).",
        "Different from the feedforward design, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have the advantage of being able to take into account an unbounded history of previous observations.",
        "In theory, this enables them to model long-distance dependencies of arbitrary length.",
        "However, while previous work on translation modeling with recurrent neural networks shows its effectiveness on standard base-lines, so far no notable gains have been presented on top of recurrent language models (Auli et al., 2013; Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Hu et al., 2014).",
        "In this work, we present two novel approaches to recurrent neural translation modeling: word-based and phrase-based.",
        "The word-based approach assumes one-to-one aligned source and target sentences.",
        "We evaluate different ways of resolving alignment ambiguities to obtain such alignments.",
        "The phrase-based RNN approach is more closely tied to the underlying translation paradigm.",
        "It models actual phrasal translation probabilities while avoiding sparsity issues by using single words as input and output units.",
        "Fur-thermore, in addition to the unidirectional formu-lation, we are the first to propose a bidirectional architecture which can take the full source sentence into account for all predictions.",
        "Our experiments show that these models can improve state-of-the-art baselines containing a recurrent language model on three tasks.",
        "For our competitive IWSLT 2013 German?English system, we observe gains of up to 1.6% BLEU and 1.7% TER.",
        "Improvements are also demonstrated on top of our evaluation systems for BOLT Arabic?English and Chinese?English, which also include recurrent neural language models.",
        "The rest of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we review related work and in Section 3 an overview of long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, a special type of recurrent neural networks we make use of in this work, is given.",
        "Section 4 describes our novel translation models.",
        "Finally, experiments are presented in Section 5 and we conclude with Section 6.",
        "14 2 Related Work In this Section we contrast previous work to ours, where we design RNNs to model bilingual depen-dencies, which are applied to rerank n-best lists after decoding.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, the earliest attempts to apply neural networks in machine translation (MT) are presented in (Casta?no et al., 1997; Casta?no and Casacuberta, 1997; Casta?no and Casacuberta, 1999), where they were used for example-based MT.",
        "Recently, Le et al. (2012) presented translation models using an output layer with classes and a shortlist for rescoring using feedforward networks.",
        "They compare between word-factored and tuple-factored n-gram models, obtaining their best results using the word-factored approach, which is less amenable to data sparsity issues.",
        "Both of our word-based and phrase-based models eventually work on the word level.",
        "Kalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013) use recurrent neural networks with full source sentence representations.",
        "The continuous representations are obtained by applying a sequence of convolutions, and the result is fed into the hidden layer of a recurrent language model.",
        "Rescoring results indicate no improvements over the state of the art.",
        "Auli et al. (2013) also include source sentence representations built either using Latent Semantic Analysis or by concatenating word embeddings.",
        "This approach produced no notable gain over systems using a recurrent language model.",
        "On the other hand, our proposed bidirectional models include the full source sentence relying on recurrency, yielding improvements over competitive baselines already including a recurrent language model.",
        "RNNs were also used with minimum translation units (Hu et al., 2014), which are phrase pairs undergoing certain constraints.",
        "At the input layer, each of the source and target phrases are modeled as a bag of words, while the output phrase is predicted word-by-word assuming conditional independence.",
        "The approach seeks to alleviate data sparsity problems that would arise if phrases were to be uniquely distinguished.",
        "Our proposed phrase-based models maintain word order within phrases, but the phrases are processed in a word-pair manner, while the phrase boundaries remain implicitly encoded in the way the words are presented to the network.",
        "Schwenk (2012) proposed a feedforward network that predicts phrases of a fixed maximum length, such that all phrase words are predicted at once.",
        "The prediction is conditioned on the source phrase.",
        "Since our phrase-based model predicts one word at a time, it does not assume any phrase length.",
        "Moreover, our model's predictions go beyond phrase boundaries and cover unbounded history and future contexts.",
        "Using neural networks during decoding requires tackling the costly output normalization step.",
        "Vaswani et al. (2013) avoid this step by training feedforward neural language models using noise contrastive estimation, while Devlin et al. (2014) augment the training objective function to produce approximately normalized scores directly.",
        "The latter work makes use of translation and joint models, and pre-computes the first hidden layer beforehand, resulting in large speedups.",
        "They report major improvements over strong baselines.",
        "The speedups achieved by both works allowed to integrate feedforward neural networks into the decoder.",
        "3 LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks Our work is based on recurrent neural networks.",
        "In related fields like e. g. language modeling, this type of neural network has been shown to perform considerably better than standard feedforward architectures (Mikolov et al., 2011; Arisoy et al., 2012; Sundermeyer et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014).",
        "Most commonly, recurrent neural networks are trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD), where the gradient of the training criterion is computed with the backpropagation through time algorithm (Rumelhart et al., 1986; Werbos, 1990; Williams and Zipser, 1995).",
        "However, the combination of RNN networks with conventional backpropagation training leads to conceptual difficulties which are known as the vanishing (or explod-ing) gradient problem, described e. g. in (Bengio et al., 1994).",
        "To remedy this problem, in (Hochre- iter and Schmidhuber, 1997) it was suggested to modify the architecture of a standard RNN in such a way that vanishing and exploding gradients are avoided during backpropagation.",
        "In particular, no modification of the training algorithm is necessary.",
        "The resulting architecture is referred to as long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network.",
        "Bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BRNNs) were first proposed in (Schuster and Paliwal, 1997) and applied to speech recognition tasks.",
        "They have been since applied to different 15 Surfers , for example , know this incredibly .",

        "tasks like parsing (Henderson, 2004) and spoken language understanding (Mesnil et al., 2013).",
        "Bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) networks are BRNNs using LSTM hidden layers (Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005).",
        "This work introduces BLSTMs to the problem of machine translation, allowing powerful models that employ unlimited history and future information to make predictions.",
        "While the proposed models do not make any assumptions about the type of RNN used, all of our experiments make use of recurrent LSTM neural networks, where we include later LSTM extensions proposed in (Gers et al., 2000; Gers et al., 2003).",
        "The cross-entropy error criterion is used for training.",
        "Further details on LSTM neural networks can be found in (Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005; Sundermeyer et al., 2012).",
        "4 Translation Modeling with RNNs In the following we describe our word- and phrase-based translation models in detail.",

        "4.1 Resolving Alignment Ambiguities Our word-based recurrent models are only defined for one-to-one-aligned source-target sentence pairs.",
        "In this work, we always evaluate the model in the order of the target sentence.",
        "How-ever, we experiment with several different ways to resolve ambiguities due to unaligned or multiply aligned words.",

        "If an \u000f unaligned is introduced on the target side, its position is determined by the aligned source word that is closest to the unaligned source word in question, preferring left to right.",
        "To resolve one-to-many alignments, we use an IBM-1 translation table to decide for one of the alignment connections to be kept.",
        "The remaining words are also either deleted or aligned to additionally introduced \u000f aligned tokens on the opposite side.",

        "The other normalization sum needed to produce the word probability is limited to the words belonging to the same class (Goodman, 2001; Morin and Bengio, 2005).",
        "4.3 Phrase-based RNN Models One of the conceptual disadvantages of word-based modeling as introduced in the previous section is that there is a mismatch between training and testing conditions: During neural network training, the vocabulary has to be extended by additional \u000f tokens, and a one-to-one alignment is used which does not reflect the situation in decoding.",
        "In phrase-based machine translation, more complex alignments in terms of multiple words on both the source and the target sides are used, which allow the decoder to make use of richer short-distance dependencies and are crucial for the performance of the resulting system.",
        "From this perspective, it seems interesting to standardize the alignments used in decoding, and in training the neural network.",
        "However, it is difficult to use the phrases themselves as the vocabulary of the RNN.",

        "due to data sparsity.",
        "This is confirmed by results presented in (Le et al., 2012), which show that a word-factored translation model outperforms the phrase-factored version.",
        "Therefore, in this work we continue relying on source and target word vocabularies for building our phrase representations.",
        "However, we no longer use a direct correspondence between a source and a target word, as enforced in our word-based models.",

        "By leaving out the conditioning on the target side, we obtain a phrase-based translation model.",
        "As there is no one-to-one correspondence between the words within a phrase, the basic idea of our phrase-based approach is to let the neural network learn the dependencies itself, and present the full source side of the phrase to the network before letting it predict target side words.",
