        "A general approach for supervised Chinese word segmentation is to formulate it as a character sequence labeling problem, to label each character with its location in a word.",
        "For example, Xue (2003) proposes a four-label scheme based on some linguistic intuitions: ?B?",
        "for the beginning character of a word, ?I?",
        "for the internal characters, ?E?",
        "for the ending character, and ?S?",
        "for single-character word.",
        "Thus the word sequence ????",
        "????",
        "can be turned into a character sequence with labels as?\\B?\\I?\\E?\\S?\\B?\\E.",
        "A machine learning algorithm for sequence label-ing, such as conditional random fields (CRF) (Laf- ferty et al., 2001), can be applied to the labelled training data to learn a model.",
        "Labelled data for supervised learning of Chinese word segmentation, however, is usually expensive and tends to be of a limited amount.",
        "Researchers are thus interested in semi-supervised learning, which is to make use of unlabelled data to further improve the performance of supervised learning.",
        "There is a large amount of unlabelled data available, for example, the Gigaword corpus in the LDC catalog or the Chinese Wikipedia on the web.",
        "Faced with the large amount of unlabelled data, an intuitive idea is to use self-training or EM, by first training a baseline model (from the supervised data) and then iteratively decoding the unlabelled data and updating the baseline model.",
        "Jiao et al. (2006) and Mann and McCallum (2007) further propose to minimize the entropy of the predicted label distribution on unlabeled data and use it as a regularization term in CRF (i.e. entropy reg-ularization).",
        "Beyond these ideas, Liang (2005) and Sun and Xu (2011) experiment with deriving a large set of statistical features such as mutual information and accessor variety from unlabelled data, and add them to supervised discriminative training.",
        "Zeng et al. (2013b) experiment with graph propagation to extract information from unlabelled data to regularize the CRF training.",
        "Yang and Vozila (2013), Zhang et al. (2013), and Zeng et al. (2013a) experiment with co-training for semi-supervised Chinese word segmentation.",
        "All these approaches only leverage the distribution of the unlabelled data, yet do not make use of the knowledge that the unlabelled data might have integrated in.",
        "There could be valuable information encoded within the unlabelled data that researchers can take advantage of.",
        "For example, punctuation creates natural word boundaries (Li and Sun, 2009): the character before a comma can only be labelled as either ?S?",
        "or ?E?, while the character after a comma can only be labelled as ?S?",
        "or ?B?.",
        "Fur-thermore, entity tags (HTML tags or Wikipedia tags) on the web, such as emphasis and cross refer-ence, also provide rich information for word seg-mentation: they might define a word or at least 90 Figure 1: Sausage constraint (partial labels) from natural annotations and punctuation give word boundary information similar to punctuation.",
        "Jiang et al. (2013) refer to such structural information on the web as natural annotations, and propose that they encode knowledge for NLP.",
        "For Chinese word segmentation, natural annotations and punctuation create a sausage 1 constraint for the possible labels, as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "In the sentence ???????????????",
        "????",
        "?, the first character ?",
        "can only be labelled with ?S?",
        "or ?B?",
        "; and the characters?",
        "before the comma and ?",
        "before the Chinese period can only be labelled as ?S?",
        "or ?E?.",
        "??????",
        "and ??",
        "????",
        "are two Wikipedia entities, and so they define the word boundaries before the first character and after the last character of the entities as well.",
        "The single character ?",
        "between these two entities has only one label ?S?.",
        "This sausage constraint thus encodes rich information for word segmentation.",
        "To make use of the knowledge encoded in the sausage constraint, Jiang et al. (2013) adopt a constrained decode approach.",
        "They first train a baseline model with labelled data, and then run constrained decode on the unlabelled data by binding the search space with the sausage; and so the decoded labels are consistent with the sausage constraint.",
        "The unlabelled data, together with the labels from constrained decode, are then selectively added to the labelled data for training the final model.",
        "This approach, using constrained decode as a middle step, provides an indirect way of leaning the knowledge.",
        "However, the middle step, constrained decode, has the risk of reinforcing the errors in the baseline model: the decoded labels added to the training data for building the final model might contain errors introduced from the baseline model.",
        "The knowledge encoded in 1 Also referred to as confusion network.",
        "the data carrying the information from punctuation and natural annotations is thus polluted by the errorful re-decoded labels.",
        "A sentence where each character has exactly one label is fully-labelled; and a sentence where each character receives all possible labels is zero-labelled.",
        "A sentence with sausage-constrained labels can be viewed as partially-labelled.",
        "These partial labels carry valuable information that researchers would like to learn in a model, yet the normal CRF training typically uses fully-labelled sentences.",
        "Recently, T?ackstr?om et al. (2013) propose an approach to train a CRF model directly from partial labels.",
        "The basic idea is to marginalize the probability mass of the constrained sausage in the cost function.",
        "The normal CRF training using fully-labelled sentences is a special case where the sausage constraint is a linear line; while on the other hand a zero-labelled sentence, where the sausage constraint is the full lattice, makes no contribution in the learning since the sum of probabilities is deemed to be one.",
        "This new approach, without the need of using constrained re-decoding as a middle step, provides a direct means to learn the knowledge in the partial labels.",
        "In this research we explore using the partial-label learning for semi-supervised Chinese word segmentation.",
        "We use the CTB-6 corpus as the labelled training, development and test data, and use the Chinese Wikipedia as the unlabelled data.",
        "We first train a baseline model with labelled data only, and then selectively add Wikipedia data with partial labels to build a second model.",
        "Because the Wikipedia data is out of domain and has distribution bias, we also experiment with two domain adaptation techniques: model interpolation and EasyAdapt (Daum?e III, 2007).",
        "Our result reaches an F-measure of 95.98%, an absolute improvement of 0.72% over the very strong base-91 line (corresponding to 15.19% relative error re-duction), and 0.33% over the constrained decode approach (corresponding to 7.59% relative error reduction).",
        "We conduct a detailed error analy-sis, illustrating how partial-label learning excels constrained decode in learning the knowledge encoded in the Wikipedia data.",
        "As a note, our result also out-performs (Wang et al., 2011) and (Sun and Xu, 2011).",

        "To create the partial labels in the Wikipedia data, we use the information from cross-reference, emphasis, and punctuation.",
        "In our pilot study we found that it's beneficial to force a cross-reference or emphasis entity as a word when the item has 2 or 3 characters.",

        "When we look at the partial-label model, how-ever, the results tell a totally different story.",
        "Figure 3: Wiki label evaluation results: Full Figure 4: Wiki label evaluation results: Label Figure 5: CTB evaluation results 95 First, it actually performs worse than the baseline model, and the more data added to train-ing, the worse the performance is.",
        "In the previous section we show that partial-label learning is more effective in learning the encoded knowledge in Wikipedia data than constrained decode.",
        "So, what goes wrong?",
        "We hypothesize that there is an out-of-domain distribution bias in the partial la-bels, and so the more data we add, the worse the in-domain performance is.",
        "Constrained decode actually helps to smooth out the out-of-domain distribution bias by using the re-decoded labels with the in-domain supervised baseline model.",
        "For example, both the baseline model and constrained decode correctly give the segmentation ???/?/??/?/???/?/?",
        "?, while partial-label learning gives incorrect segmentation ??",
        "?/?/??/?/?/??/?/??.",

        "Partial-label learning, which focuses on the tagged entities, thus overrules the segmentation of ??",
        "?.",
        "Constrained decode, on the other hand, by using the correctly re-decoded labels from the baseline model, observes enough evidence to correctly segment???",
        "as a word.",
        "To smooth out the out-of-domain distribution bias, we experiment with two approaches: model interpolation and EasyAdapt (Daum?e III, 2007).",
        "5.1.1 Model interpolation We linearly interpolate the model of partial-label learningM pl with the baseline modelM 0 to create the final model M pl + , as shown in Equation 7.",
        "The interpolation weight is optimized via a grid search between 0.0 and 1.0 with a step of 0.1, tuned on the CTB-6 development set.",
        "Again we modify wapiti so that it takes two models and an interpolation weight as input.",
        "For each model it creates a search lattice with posteriors, and then linearly combines the two lattices using the interpolation weight to create the final search space for decoding.",
        "As shown in Figure 5, model M pl + consistently out-performs constrained decode in all data points.",
        "We also see the trend of better performance with more training data.",
        "M pl + = ?",
        "?M 0 + (1?",
        "?)",
        "?M pl (7) 5.1.2 EasyAdapt EasyAdapt is a straightforward technique but has been shown effective in many domain adaptation tasks (Daum?e III, 2007).",
        "We train the model M pl ea with feature augmentation.",
        "For each out-of-domain training instance < x o , y o >, where x o is the input features and y o is the (partial) labels, we copy the features and file them as an additional feature set, and so the training instance becomes< x o , x o , y o >.",
        "The in-domain training data remains the same.",
        "Consistent with (Daum?e III, 2007), EasyAdapt gives us the best performance, as show in Figure 5.",
        "Furthermore, unlike in (Jiang et al., 2013) where they find a plateau, our results show no harm adding more training data for partial-label learning when integrated with domain adaptation, although the performance seems to saturate after 400k sentences.",
        "Finally, we search for the parameter setting of best performance on the CTB-6 development set, which is to use EasyAdapt with K = 600k sentences of Wikipedia data.",
        "With this setting, the performance on the CTB-6 test set is 95.98% in F-measure.",
        "This is 0.72% absolute improvement over supervised baseline (corresponding to 15.19% relative error reduction), and 0.33% absolute improvement over constrained decode (cor- responding to 7.59% relative error reduction); the differences are both statistically significant (p < 0.001).",
        "5 As a note, this result out-performs (Sun and Xu, 2011) (95.44%) and (Wang et al., 2011) (95.79%), and the differences are also statistically significant (p < 0.001).",
        "5.2 Analysis with examples To better understand why partial-label learning is more effective in learning the encoded knowledge, we look at cases where M 0 and M cd have the incorrect segmentation while M pl (and its domain adaptation variance M pl + and M pl ea ) have the correct segmentation.",
        "We find that the majority is due to the error in re-decoded labels outside of encoded knowledge.",
        "For example, M 0 and M cd give the segmentation ???/?/?/?/6.9/?",
        "?, yet the correct segmentation given by partial-label learning is ???/?/?",

        "The former comes from the encoded knowledge while the latter comes from re-decoded labels by the baseline model.",
        "The much bigger number of incorrect labels from the baseline re-decoding badly pollute the encoded knowledge.",
        "This example illustrates that constrained decode reinforces the errors from the baseline.",
        "On the other hand, the training materials for partial-label learning are purely the encoded knowledge, which is not impacted by the baseline model error.",

        "?\\B ?\\E?",
        "and so is able to learn that??",
        "is a word.",
        "As a final remark, we want to make a point that, although the re-decoded labels serve to smooth out the distribution bias, the Wikipedia data is indeed not the ideal data set for such a purpose, because it itself is out of domain.",
        "The performance tends to degrade when we apply the baseline model to re-decode the out-of-domain Wikipedia data.",
        "The errorful re-decoded labels, when being used to train the model M cd , could lead to further errors.",
        "For example, the baseline model M 0 is able to give the correct segmentation ???/????",
        "in the CTB-6 test set.",
        "However, when it is applied to the Wikipedia data for constrained de-code, for the seven occurrences of??",
        "?, three of which are correctly labelled as ?",

        "On the other hand, model interpolation or EasyAdapt with partial-label learning, focusing only on the encoded knowledge and not being impacted by the errorful re-decoded labels, performs correctly in this case.",
        "For a more fair comparison between partial-label learning and constrained de-code, we have also plotted the results of model interpolation and EasyAdapt for constrained decode in Figure 5.",
        "As can be seen, they improve on constrained decode a bit but still fall behind the correspondent domain adaptation approach of partial-label learning.",
        "6 Conclusion and future work There is rich information encoded in online web data.",
        "For example, punctuation and entity tags define some word boundaries.",
        "In this paper we show the effectiveness of partial-label learning in digesting the encoded knowledge from Wikipedia data for the task of Chinese word segmentation.",
        "Unlike approaches such as constrained decode that use the errorful re-decoded labels, partial-label learning provides a direct means to learn the encoded knowledge.",
        "By integrating some domain adaptation techniques such as EasyAdapt, we achieve an F-measure of 95.98% in the CTB-6 corpus, a significant improvement from both the supervised baseline and constrained decode.",
        "Our results also beat (Wang et al., 2011) and (Sun and Xu, 2011).",
        "In this research we employ a sausage constraint to encode the knowledge for Chinese word segmentation.",
        "However, a sausage constraint does not reflect the legal label sequence.",
