        "SMT has made significant progress over the last decade, not least due to the availability of increasingly larger data sets.",
        "Large-scale SMT systems are now routinely trained on millions of sentences of parallel data, and billions of words of monolingual data for language modeling.",
        "Large data sets are often beneficial, but they do create certain other problems.",
        "First, they place higher demands on computational resources (storage and compute).",
        "Hence, existing software infrastructure may need to be adapted and optimized to handle such large data sets.",
        "Second, experimental turn-around time is increased as well, making it more difficult to quickly train, fine-tune, and evaluate novel modeling approaches.",
        "Most importantly, however, SMT performance does not increase linearly with the training data size but levels off after a certain point.",
        "This is because the additional training data may be noisy, irrelevant to the task at hand, or inherently redundant.",
        "Thus, a linear increase in the amount of training data typically leads to a sublinear increase in performance, an effect known as diminishing returns.",
        "Several recent papers (Bloodgood and Callison-Burch, 2010; Turchi et al., 2012a; Turchi et al., 2012b) have amply demonstrated this effect.",
        "A way to counteract this is to perform data subset selection, i.e., choose a subset of the available training data to optimize a particular quality criterion.",
        "One scheme is to select a subset that expresses as much of the information in the original data set as possible - i.e., the data set should be ?summarized?",
        "by excluding redundant information.",
        "Another scheme, popular in the context of SMT, is to subselect the original training set to match the properties of a particular test set.",
        "In this paper, we introduce submodularity for subselecting SMT training data, a methodology that follows both of the above schemes.",
        "1 Submodular functions (Fujishige, 2005) are a class of discrete set functions having the property of diminishing returns.",
        "They occur naturally in a wide range of problems in a diverse set of fields including economics, game theory, operations research, circuit theory, and more recently machine learning.",
        "Submodular functions share certain properties with convexity (e.g., naturalness and mathematical tractability) although submodularity is still quite distinct from convexity.",
        "We present a novel class of submodular functions particularly suited for SMT subselection and evaluate it against state-of-the-art baseline methods on two different translation tasks, showing that our method outperforms them significantly in most cases.",
        "While many approaches to SMT data selection have been developed previously (a detailed overview is provided in Section 3), many of them are heuristic and do not offer performance guarantees.",
        "Certain previous approaches, however, have 1 As far as we know, submodularity has not before been explicitly utilized for SMT subset selection.",
        "131 inadvertently made use of submodular methods.",
        "This, in addition to our own positive results, provides strong evidence that submodularity is a natural and practical framework for data subset selection in SMT and related fields.",
        "An additional advantage of this framework is that many submodular programs (e.g., the greedy procedure reviewed in Section 2) are fast and scalable to large data sets.",
        "By contrast, trying to solve a submodular problem using, say, an integer-linear programming (ILP) procedure, would lead to impenetrable scalability problems.",

        "Next we review previous approaches to MT data selection (Section 3) and analyze them with respect to their submodular properties.",

        "The fact that submodularity is implicitly and unintentionally used in previous work suggests that it is natural for this problem.",
        "A currently widely-used data selection method in SMT (which we also use as a baseline in Section 6) uses the cross-entropy between two language models (Moore and Lewis, 2010), one trained on the test set of interest, and another trained on a large set of generic or out-of-domain training data.",
        "We call this the cross-entropy method.",

        "Finally, the top N sentences are chosen.",
        "In (Axelrod et al., 2011) this method is extended to take both sides of the parallel corpus into account rather than just the source side.",
        "The cross-entropy approach values each sentence individually, without regard to any interaction with already selected sentences.",

        "Thanks to modularity, the problem is no longer NP-complete, and the threshold method solves Eqn. (2) exactly.",
        "On the other hand, a modular function does not have the diminishing returns property, and thus has no chance to represent interaction or redundancy between sentences.",
        "The chosen subset, therefore, might have an enormous overrepresentation of one aspect of the training data while having minimal or no representation of another aspect, a major vulnerability of this approach.",
        "Other methods use information retrieval (Hilde- brand et al., 2005; L?u et al., 2007) which can also be described as modular function optimization (e.g., take the top k scoring sentences).",
        "Duplicate 134 sentence removal is easily represented by a feature-based submodular function, Equation (4), where there is one sentence-specific feature per sentence and where ?",

        "{u}|,1) ?",
        "once a sentence is chosen, its contribution is saturated so any duplicate sentence has a gain of zero.",
        "Also, the unseen n-gram function of (Eck et al., 2005; Bloodgood and Callison-Burch, 2010) corresponds to a bipartite neighborhood submodular function, with a weight function defined based on n-gram counts.",

        "submodular optimization inherently removes redundancy.",
        "Also, (Callison-Burch et al., 2005; Lopez, 2007) involve modular functions but where selection is over subsets of phrases (rather than sentences as in our current work) and where multiple selections occur, each specific to an individual test set sentence rather than the entire test set.",
        "In the feature-decay method, presented in (Bic?ici, 2011; Bic?ici and Yuret, 2011; Bic?ici, 2013), the value of a sentence is based on its decomposition into a set of feature values.",
