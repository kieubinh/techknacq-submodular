        "Word alignment is an important component in statistical machine translation (SMT).",
        "For instance phrase-based SMT (Koehn et al., 2003) is based on the concept of phrase pairs that are automatically extracted from bilingual data and rely on word alignment annotation.",
        "Similarly, the model for hierarchical phrase-based SMT is built from exhaustively extracted phrases that are, in turn, heavily reliant on word alignment.",
        "The Generative word alignment models, such as the IBM Models (Brown et al., 1993) and HMM (Vogel et al., 1996), are popular methods for automatically aligning bilingual texts, but are restricted to represent one-to-many correspondence of each word.",
        "To resolve this weakness, various symmetrization methods are proposed.",
        "Och and Ney (2003) and Koehn et al. (2003) propose various heuristic methods to combine two directional models to represent many-to-many relationships.",
        "As an alternative to heuristic methods, filtering methods employ a threshold to control the trade-off between precision and recall based on a score estimated from the posterior probabilities from two directional models.",
        "Matusov et al. (2004) proposed arithmetic means of two models as a score for the filtering, whereas Liang et al. (2006) reported better results using geometric means.",
        "The joint training method (Liang et al., 2006) enforces agreement between two directional models.",
        "Posterior regularization (Ganchev et al., 2010) is an alternative agreement method which directly encodes agreement during training.",
        "DeN-ero and Macherey (2011) and Chang et al. (2014) also enforce agreement during decoding.",
        "However, these agreement models do not take into account the difference in language pairs, which is crucial for linguistically different language pairs, such as Japanese and English: although content words may be aligned with each other by introducing some agreement constraints, function words are difficult to align.",
        "We focus on the posterior regularization framework and improve upon the previous work by proposing new constraint functions that take into account the difference in languages in terms of content words and function words.",
        "In particular, we differentiate between content words and function words by frequency in bilingual data, following Setiawan et al. (2007).",
        "Experimental results show that the proposed methods achieved better alignment qualities on the French-English Hansard data and the Japanese-English Kyoto free translation task (KFTT) measured by AER and F-measure.",

        "toolkit was used as a decoder (Koehn et al., 2007) and the model parameters were tuned by k-best MIRA (Cherry and Foster, 2012).",
        "In order to avoid tuning insta-bility, we evaluated the average of five runs (Hop- kins and May, 2011).",

        "Our proposed methods achieved large gains in NTCIR10 task with the filtered method, but observed no gain in the KFTT with the filtered method.",
        "In NTCIR10 task with GDF, the gain in BLEU was smaller than that of KFTT.",
        "We calculate p-values and the difference between symmetric and c2c (the most effective proposed con-straint) are lower than 0.05 in kftt with GDF and NTCIR10 with filtered method.",
        "There seems to be no clear tendency in the improved alignment qualities and the translation qualities, as shown in numerous previous studies (Ganchev et al., 2008).",

        "Our constraint functions introduce a fine-grained agreement constraint considering the frequency of words, a assuming that the high frequency words correspond to function words whereas the less frequent words may be treated as content words, based on the previous work of Setiawan et al. (2007).",
        "Experiments on word alignment tasks showed better alignment qualities measured by F-measure and AER on both the Hansard task and KFTT.",
        "We also observed large gain in BLEU, 0.2 on average, when compared with the previous posterior regularization method under NTCIR10 task.",
        "As our future work, we will investigate more precise methods for deciding function words and content words for better alignment and translation qualities.",
