        "Within machine translation (MT), efforts are ongoing to improve evaluation metrics and find better ways to automatically assess translation quality.",
        "The process of validating a new metric involves demonstration that it correlates better with human judgment than a standard metric such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001).",
        "However, although it is standard practice in MT evaluation to measure increases in automatic metric scores with significance tests (Germann, 2003; Och, 2003; Kumar and Byrne, 2004; Koehn, 2004; Riezler and Maxwell, 2005; Graham et al., 2014), this has not been the case in papers proposing new metrics.",
        "Thus it is possible that some reported improvements in correlation with human judgment are attributable to chance rather than a systematic improvement.",
        "In this paper, we motivate and introduce a novel significance test to assess the statistical significance of differences in correlation with human judgment for pairs of automatic metrics.",
        "We apply tests to the WMT-12 shared metrics task to compare each of the participating methods, and find that for a high proportion of metrics, there is not enough evidence to conclude that they significantly outperform BLEU.",
        "2 Correlation with Human Judgment A common means of assessing automatic MT evaluation metrics is Spearman's rank correlation with human judgments (Melamed et al., 2003), which measures the relative degree of monotonicity between the metric and human scores in the range [?1, 1].",
        "The standard justification for calculating correlations over ranks rather than raw scores is to: (a) reduce anomalies due to absolute score differences; and (b) focus evaluation on what is generally the primary area of interest, namely the ranking of systems/translations.",
        "An alternative means of evaluation is Pearson's correlation, which measures the linear correlation between a metric and human scores (Leusch et al., 2003).",
        "Debate on the relative merits of Spear-man's and Pearson's correlation for the evaluation of automatic metrics is ongoing, but there is an increasing trend towards Pearson's correlation, e.g. in the recent WMT-14 shared metrics task.",

        "These two metrics achieved the joint-highest rank correlation (?",
        "= 0.965) for the task, but differ greatly in terms of Pearson's correlation (r = 0.881 vs. 0.971, resp.).",
        "The largest contributor to this artifact is the system with the lowest human score, represented by the leftmost point in both plots.",

        "There is still the question, however, of whether an observed difference in Pearson's r is statistically significant, which we address in the next section.",
        "3 Significance Testing Evaluation of a new automatic metric, M new , commonly takes the form of quantifying the correlation between the new metric and human judg-ment, r(M new , H), and contrasting it with the correlation for some baseline metric, r(M base , H).",
        "It is very rare in the MT literature for significance testing to be performed in such cases, however.",
        "We introduce a statistical test which can be used for this purpose, and apply the test to the evaluation of metrics participating in the WMT-12 metric evaluation task.",
        "At first gloss, it might seem reasonable to perform significance testing in the following manner when an increase in correlation with human assessment is observed: apply a significance test separately to the correlation of each metric with human judgment, with the hope that the newly proposed metric will achieve a significant correlation where the baseline metric does not.",
        "However, besides the fact that the correlation between almost any document-level metric and human judgment will generally be significantly greater than zero, the logic here is flawed: the fact that one correlation is significantly higher than zero (r(M new , H)) and that of another is not, does not necessarily mean that the difference between the two correlations is significant.",
        "Instead, a specific test should be applied to the difference in correlations on the data.",
        "For this same reason, confidence intervals for individual correlations with human judgment are also not particularly meaningful.",
        "In psychological studies, it is often the case that samples that data are drawn from are independent, and differences in correlations are computed on independent data sets.",
        "In such cases, the Fisher r to z transformation is applied to test for significant differences in correlations.",
        "In the case of automatic metric evaluation, however, the data sets used are almost never independent.",
        "This means that if r(M base , H) and r(M new , H) are both> 0, the correlation between the metric scores them-selves, r(M base ,M new ), must also be > 0.",
        "The strength of this correlation, directly between pairs of metrics, should be taken into account using a significance test of the difference in correlation between r(M base , H) and r(M new , H).",
        "3.1 Correlated Correlations Correlations computed for two separate automatic metrics on the same data set are not independent, and for this reason in order to test the difference in correlation between them, the degree to which the pair of metrics correlate with each other should be taken into account.",
