        "Translation rules have been central to hierarchical phrase-based and syntactic statistical machine translation (SMT) (Galley et al., 2004; Chiang, 2005; Liu et al., 2006; Quirk et al., 2005; Marcu et al., 2006; Shen and Joshi, 2008; Xie et al., 2011).",
        "They are attractive by capturing the recursiveness of languages and syntactic correspondences between them.",
        "One important advantage of translation rules is that they allow efficient decoding by treating MT as a statistical parsing task, transforming a source sentence to its translation via recursive rule application.",
        "The efficiency takes root in the fact that target word orders are encoded in translation rules.",
        "This fact, however, also leads to rule explosion, noise and coverage problems (Auli et al., 2009), which can hurt translation quality.",
        "Flexibility of function word usage, rich morphology and paraphrasing all add to the difficulty of rule extraction.",
        "In addition, restricting target word orders by hard translation rules can also hurt output fluency.",
        "?",
        "* Work done while visiting Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) Figure 1: Overall system architecture.",
        "A potential solution to the problems above is to treat translation as a generation task, representing syntactic correspondences using soft features.",
        "Both adequacy and fluency can potentially be improved by giving full flexibility to target synthe-sis, and leaving all options to the statistical model.",
        "The main challenge to this method is a significant increase in the search space (Knight, 1999).",
        "To this end, recent advances in tackling complex search tasks for text generation offer some solutions (White and Rajkumar, 2009; Zhang and Clark, 2011).",
        "In this short paper, we present a preliminary investigation on the possibility of building a syntactic SMT system that does not use hard translation rules, by utilizing recent advances in statistical natural language generation (NLG).",
        "The overall architecture is shown in Figure 1.",
        "Translation is performed by first parsing the source sentence, then transferring source words and phrases to their target equivalences, and finally synthesizing the target output.",
        "We choose dependency grammar for both the source and the target syntax, and adapt the syntactic text synthesis system of Zhang (2013), which performs dependency-based linearization.",
        "The linearization task for MT is different from the monolingual task in that not all translation options are used to build the output, and that bilingual correspondences need to be taken into account dur-177 ing synthesis.",
        "The algorithms of Zhang (2013) are modified to perform word selection as well as or-dering, using two sets of features to control translation adequacy and fluency, respectively.",
        "Preliminary experiments on the IWSLT1 2010 data show that the system gives BLEU comparable to traditional tree-to-string and string-to-tree translation systems.",
        "It demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging statistical NLG techniques for SMT, and the possibility of building a statistical transfer-based MT system.",
        "2 Approach The main goal being proof of concept, we keep the system simple by utilizing existing methods for the main components, minimizing engineering efforts.",
        "Shown in Figure 1, the end-to-end system consists of two main components: lexical transfer and synthesis.",
        "The former provides candidate translations for (overlapping) source words and phrases.",
        "Although lexicons and rules can be used for this step, we take a simple statistical alignment-based approach.",
        "The latter searches for a target translation by constructing dependency trees bottom-up.",
        "The process can be viewed as a syntax-based generation process from a bag of overlapping translation options.",
        "2.1 Lexical transfer We perform word alignment using IBM model 4 (Brown et al., 1993), and then extract phrase pairs according to the alignment and automatically-annotated target syntax.",
        "In particular, consistent (Och et al., 1999) and cohesive (Fox, 2002) phrase pairs are extracted from intersected alignments in both directions: the target side must form a projective span, with a single root, and the source side must be contiguous.",
        "A resulting phrase pair consists of the source phrase, its target translation, as well as the head position and head part-of-speech (POS) of the target span, which are useful for target synthesis.",
        "We further restrict that neither the source nor the target side of a valid phrase pair contains over s words.",
        "Given an input source sentence, the lexical transfer unit finds all valid target translation options for overlapping source phrases up to size s, and feeds them as inputs to the target synthesis decoder.",
        "The translation options with a probability 1International Workshop on Spoken Language Transla-tion, http://iwslt2010.fbk.eu below ?",
        "?",
        "P max are filtered out, where P max is the probability of the most probable translation.",
        "Here the probability of a target translation is calculated as the count of the translation divided by the count of all translations of the source phrase.",
        "2.2 Synthesis The synthesis module is based on the monolingual text synthesis algorithm of Zhang (2013), which constructs an ordered dependency tree given a bag of words.",
        "In the bilingual setting, inputs to the algorithm are translation options, which can be overlapping and mutually exclusive, and not necessarily all of which are included in the output.",
        "As a result, the decoder needs to perform word selection in addition to word ordering.",
        "Another difference between the bilingual and monolingual settings is that the former requires translation adequacy in addition to output fluency.",
        "We largely rely on the monolingual system for MT decoding.",
        "To deal with overlapping translation options, a source coverage vector is used to impose mutual exclusiveness on input words and phrases.",
        "Each element in the coverage vector is a binary value that indicates whether a particular source word has been translated in the corresponding target hypothesis.",
        "For translation adequacy, we use a set of bilingual features on top of the set of monolingual features for text synthesis.",
        "2.2.1 Search The search algorithm is the best-first algorithm of Zhang (2013).",
        "Each search hypothesis is a partial or full target-language dependency tree, and hypotheses are constructed bottom-up from leaf nodes, which are translation options.",
        "An agenda is used to maintain a list of search hypothesis to be expanded, and a chart is used to record a set of accepted hypotheses.",
        "Initially empty, the chart is a beam of size k ?",
        "n, where n is the number of source words and k is a positive integer.",
        "The agenda is a priority queue, initialized with all leaf hypotheses (i.e. translation options).",
        "At each step, the highest-scored hypothesis e is popped off the agenda, and expanded by combination with all hypotheses on the chart in all possible ways, with the set of newly generated hypotheses e 1 , e 2 , ...e N being put onto the agenda, and e being put onto the chart.",

        "Zhang et al. (2012), Zhang (2013) and Song et al. (2014) further extended this line of research by adding input syntax and allowing joint inflection and ordering.",
        "de Gispert et al. (2014) use a phrase-structure grammer for word ordering.",
        "Our generation system is based on the work of Zhang (2013), but further allows lexical selection.",
        "Our work is also in line with the work of Liang et al. (2006), Blunsom et al. (2008), Flanigan et al. (2013) and Yu et al. (2013) in that we build a discriminative model for SMT.",
        "5 Conclusion We investigated a novel system for syntactic machine translation, treating MT as an unconstrained generation task, solved by using a single discriminative model with both monolingual syntax and bilingual translation features.",
        "Syntactic correspondence is captured by using soft features rather than hard translation rules, which are used by most syntax-based statistical methods in the literature.",
        "Our results are preliminary in the sense that the experiments were performed using a relatively small dataset, and little engineering effort was made on fine-tuning of parameters for the baseline and proposed models.",
        "Our Python implementation gives the same level of BLEU scores compared with baseline syntactic SMT systems, but is an order of magnitude slower than Moses.",
        "However, the results demonstrate the feasibility of leveraging text generation techniques for machine translation, directly connecting the two currently rather separated research fields.",
        "The system is not strongly dependent on the specific generation al-gorithm, and one potential of the SMT architecture is that it can directly benefit from advances in statistical NLG technology.",
