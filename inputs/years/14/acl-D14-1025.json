        "Evaluating machine translation (MT) output at the sen-tence/ segment level has turned out far more challenging than corpus/ system level.",
        "Yet, sentence level evaluation can be useful because it allows fast, fine-grained analysis of system performance on individual sentences.",
        "It is instructive to contrast two widely used metrics, METEOR (Michael Denkowski and Alon Lavie, 2014) and BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), on sentence level evaluation.",
        "METEOR constantly shows better correlation with human ranking than BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).",
        "Arguably, this shows that sentence level evaluation demands finer grained and trainable models over less sparse features.",
        "Ngrams, the core of BLEU, are sparse at the sentence level, and a mismatch for longer ngrams implies that BLEU falls back on shorter ngrams.",
        "In contrast, METEOR has a trainable model and incorporates a small, yet wider set of features that are less sparse than ngrams.",
        "We think that METEOR's features and its training approach only suggest that sentence level evaluation should be treated as a modelling challenge.",
        "This calls for questions such as what model, what features and what training objective are better suited for modelling sentence level evaluation.",
        "We start out by explicitly formulating sentence level evaluation as the problem of ranking a set of competing hypothesis.",
        "Given data consisting of human ranked system outputs, the problem then is to formulate an easy to train model for ranking.",
        "One particular existing approach (Ye et al., 2007) looks especially attractive because we think it meshes well with a range of effective techniques for learning-to-rank (Li, 2011).",
        "We deliberately select a linear modelling approach inspired by RankSVM (Herbrich et al., 1999), which is easily trainable for ranking and allows analysis of the individual contributions of features.",
        "Besides presenting a new metric and a set of known, but also a set of novel features, we target three questions of interest to the MT community: ?",
        "What kind of features are more helpful for sentence level evaluation?",
        "?",
        "How does a simple linear model trained for ranking compare to the well-developed metric METEOR on sentence level evaluation?",
        "?",
        "Should we train the model for each language pair separately or for a target language?",
        "Our new metric dubbed BEER 1 outperforms METEOR on WMT12 data showing the effectiveness of dense features in a learning-to-rank framework.",
        "The metric and the code are available as free software 2 .",
        "2 Model Our model is a linear combination of features trained for ranking similar to RankSVM (Herbrich et al., 1999) or, to readers familiar with SMT system tuning, to PRO tuning (Hopkins and May, 2011): score(sys) = ~w ?",
        "~x sys where ~w represents a weight vector and ~x sys a vector of feature values for system output sys.",
        "Looking at evaluation as a ranking problem, we contrast (at least) two system translations good and bad for the same source sentence.",
        "Assuming that humanRank(good) > humanRank(bad) as ranked 1 BEER participated on WMT14 evaluation metrics task where it was the highest scoring sentence level evaluation metric on average over all language pairs (Stanojevi?c and Sima?an, 2014) 2 https://github.com/stanojevic/beer 202 by human judgement, we expect metric score(?)",
        "to ful-fill score(good) > score(bad): ~w ?",
        "~x good > ~w ?",

        "~x good ) < 0 The two feature vectors (~x good ?",
        "~x bad ) and (~x bad ?",
        "~x good ) can be considered as positive and negative instances for training our linear classifier.",
        "For training this model, we use Logistic Regression from the Weka toolkit (Hall et al., 2009).",
        "3 Features Generally speaking we identify adequacy and fluency features.",
        "For both types we devise far less sparse features than word ngrams.",
        "Adequacy features We use precision P , recallR and F1-score F as follows: P func , R func , F func on matched function words P cont , R cont , F cont on matched content words P all , R all , F all on matched words of any type P char , R char , F char matching of the char ngrams By differentiating between function and non-function words, our metric weighs each kind of words according to importance for evaluation.",
        "Matching character ngrams, originally proposed in (Yang et al., 2013), rewards certain translations even if they did not get the morphology completely right.",
        "Existing metrics use stemmers for this, but using character ngrams is independent of the availability of a good quality stemmer.",
        "Higher-order character ngrams have less risk of sparse counts than word ngrams.",
        "In our experiments we used char ngrams for n up to 6, which makes the total number of adequacy features 27.",
        "Fluency features To evaluate word order we follow (Isozaki et al., 2010; Birch and Osborne, 2010) in representing reordering as a permutation pi over [1..n] and then measuring the distance to the ideal monotone permutation ?1, 2, ?",

        "PETs are factorizations of permutations, which allows for an abstract and less sparse view of word order as exemplified next.",
        "Kendall score was regularly shown to have high correlation with human judgment on distant language pairs (Isozaki et al., 2010; Birch and Osborne, 2010).",
        "Features based on PETs We informally review PETs in order to exploit them for novel ordering features.",
        "We refer the reader to (Zhang and Gildea, 2007) and (Maillette de Buy Wenniger and Sima?an, 2011) for a formal treatment of PETs and efficient factorization algorithms.",
        "A PET of permutation pi is a tree organization of pi's unique, atomic building blocks, called operators.",
        "Every operator on a PET node is an atomic permutation (not factorizing any further), 3 and it stands for the permutation of the direct children of that node.",

        "Statistics over ordering patterns in PETs are far less sparse than word or character ngram statistics.",
        "Intuitively, among the atomic permutations, the binary monotone operator ?1, 2?",

        "Fluency vs.",
        "Adequacy The fluency features play a smaller role than adequacy features.",
        "Apparently, many SMT systems participating in this task have rather similar reordering models, trained on similar data, which makes the fluency features not that discriminative relative to adequacy features.",
        "Perhaps in a different ap-plication, for example MT system tuning, the reordering features would be far more relevant because ignoring them would basically imply disregarding the importance of the reordering model in MT.",
        "Character vs. Word features We observe that, pre-cision, recall and F-score on character ngrams are crucial.",
        "We think that this shows that less sparse features are important for sentence level evaluation.",
        "The second best features are word features.",
        "Without word features, BEER scores just below METEOR, which suggests that word boundaries play a role as well.",
        "In contrast, differentiating between function and content words does not seem to be important.",
        "PETs vs. Kendall ?",
        "Despite the smaller role for reordering features we can make a few observations.",
        "Firstly, while PETs and Kendall seem to have similar effect on English-Foreign cases, in all four cases of Foreign-English PETs give better scores.",
        "We hypothesize that the quality of the permutations (induced between system output and reference) is better for English than for the other target languages.",
        "Discarding PET features has far larger impact than discarding Kendall.",
        "Most interestingly, for de-en it makes the difference in outperforming METEOR.",
        "In many cases discarding Kendall ?",
        "improves the BEER score, likely because it conflicts with the PET features that are found more effective.",
        "5.2 Is a linear model sufficient?",
        "A further insight, from our perspective, is that F-score features constitute a crucial set of features, even when the corresponding precision and recall features are included.",
        "Because our model merely allows for linear in-terpolation, whereas F-score is a non-linear function of precision and recall, we think this suggests that a non-linear interpolation of precision and recall is useful.",
        "4 By formulating the evaluation as a ranking problem it is relatively easy to ?upgrade?",
        "for using non-linear models while using the same (or larger) set of features.",
        "5.3 Train for the language pair or only for the target language?",
        "All our models were trained for each language pair.",
        "This is not the case with many other metrics which train their models for each target language instead of language pair.",
        "We contrast these two settings in Table 2.",
        "Training for each language pair separately does not give significant improvement over training for the target language only.",
        "A possible reason could be that by training for the target language we have more training data (in this case four times more).",
