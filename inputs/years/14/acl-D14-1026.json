        "Evaluation of Machine Translation (MT) continues to be a challenging research problem.",
        "There is an ongoing effort in finding simple and scalable metrics with rich linguistic analysis.",
        "A wide range of metrics have been proposed and evaluated mostly for European target languages (Callison-Burch et al., 2011; Mach?a?cek and Bojar, 2013).",
        "These metrics are usually evaluated based on their correlation with human judgments on a set of MT output.",
        "While there has been growing interest in building systems for translating into Arabic, the evaluation of Arabic MT is still an under-studied problem.",
        "Standard MT metrics such as BLEU (Pa- pineni et al., 2002) or TER (Snover et al., 2006) have been widely used for evaluating Arabic MT (El Kholy and Habash, 2012).",
        "These metrics use strict word and phrase matching between the MT output and reference translations.",
        "For morphologically rich target languages such as Arabic, such criteria are too simplistic and inadequate.",
        "In this paper, we present: (a) the first human judgment dataset for Arabic MT (b) the Arabic Language BLEU (AL-BLEU), an extension of the BLEU score for Arabic MT evaluation.",
        "Our annotated dataset is composed of the output of six MT systems with texts from a diverse set of topics.",
        "A group of ten native Arabic speakers annotated this corpus with high-levels of inter- and intra-annotator agreements.",
        "Our AL-BLEU metric uses a rich set of morphological, syntactic and lexical features to extend the evaluation beyond the exact matching.",
        "We conduct different experiments on the newly built dataset and demonstrate that AL-BLEU shows a stronger average correlation with human judgments than the BLEU and METEOR scores.",
        "Our dataset and our AL-BLEU metric provide useful testbeds for further research on Arabic MT and its evaluation.",
        "1 2 Related Work Several studies on MT evaluation have pointed out the inadequacy of the standard n-gram based evaluation metrics for various languages (Callison-Burch et al., 2006).",
        "For morphologically complex languages and those without word delimiters, several studies have attempted to improve upon them and suggest more reliable metrics that correlate better with human judgments (Denoual and Lep-age, 2005; Homola et al., 2009).",
        "A common approach to the problem of morphologically complex words is to integrate some linguistic knowledge in the metric.",
        "METEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2011), TER-Plus (Snover et al., 2010) incorporate limited linguistic resources.",
        "Popovi?c and Ney (2009) showed that n-gram based evaluation metrics calculated on POS sequences correlate well with human judg-ments, and recently designed and evaluated MPF, a BLEU-style metric based on morphemes and POS tags (Popovi?c, 2011).",
        "In the same direc-1 The dataset and the software are available at: http://nlp.qatar.cmu.edu/resources/ AL-BLEU 207 tion, Chen and Kuhn (2011) proposed AMBER, a modified version of BLEU incorporating re-call, extra penalties, and light linguistic knowledge about English morphology.",
        "Liu et al. (2010) propose TESLA-M, a variant of a metric based on n-gram matching that utilizes light-weight linguistic analysis including lemmatization, POS tag-ging, and WordNet synonym relations.",
        "This metric was then extended to TESLA-B to model phrase synonyms by exploiting bilingual phrase tables (Dahlmeier et al., 2011).",
        "Tantug et al. (2008) presented BLEU+, a tool that implements various extension to BLEU computation to allow for a better evaluation of the translation performance for Turkish.",
        "To the best of our knowledge the only human judgment dataset for Arabic MT is the small corpus which was used to tune parameters of the METEOR metric for Arabic (Denkowski and Lavie, 2011).",
        "Due to the shortage of Arabic human judgment dataset, studies on the performance of evaluation metrics have been constrained and limited.",
        "A relevant effort in this area is the upper-bound estimation of BLEU and METEOR scores for Arabic MT output (El Kholy and Habash, 2011).",
        "As part of its extensive functionality, the AMEANA system provides the upper-bound estimate by an exhaustive matching of morphological and lexical features between the hypothesis and the reference translations.",
        "Our use of morphological and lexical features overlaps with the AMEANA framework.",
        "However, we extend our partial matching to a supervised tuning framework for estimating the value of partial credits.",
        "Moreover, our human judgment dataset allows us to validate our framework with a large-scale gold-standard data.",
        "3 Human judgment dataset We describe here our procedure for compiling a diverse Arabic MT dataset and annotating it with human judgments.",
        "3.1 Data and systems We annotate a corpus composed of three datasets: (1) the standard English-Arabic NIST 2005 cor-pus, commonly used for MT evaluations and composed of news stories.",
        "We use the first English translation as the source and the single corresponding Arabic sentence as the reference.",
        "(2) the MEDAR corpus (Maegaard et al., 2010) that consists of texts related to the climate change with four Arabic reference translations.",
        "We only use the first reference in this study.",
        "(3) a small dataset of Wikipedia articles (WIKI) to extend our corpus and metric evaluation to topics beyond the commonly-used news topics.",
        "This sub-corpus consists of our in-house Arabic translations of seven English Wikipedia articles.",
        "The articles are: Earl Francis Lloyd, Western Europe, Citizenship, Marcus Garvey, Middle Age translation, Acadian, NBA.",
        "The English articles which do not exist in the Arabic Wikipedia were manually translated by a bilingual linguist.",
        "Table 1 gives an overview of these sub-corpora characteristics.",
        "NIST MEDAR WIKI # of Documents 100 4 7 # of Sentences 1056 509 327 Table 1: Statistics on the datasets.",
        "We use six state-of-the-art English-to-Arabic MT systems.",
        "These include four research-oriented phrase-based systems with various morphological and syntactic features and different Arabic tok-enization schemes and also two commercial off-the-shelf systems.",
        "3.2 Annotation of human judgments In order conduct a manual evaluation of the six MT systems, we formulated it as a ranking problem.",
        "We adapt the framework used in the WMT 2011 shared task for evaluating MT metrics on European language pairs (Callison-Burch et al., 2011) for Arabic MT.",
        "We gather human ranking judgments by asking ten annotators (each native speaker of Arabic with English as a second lan-guage) to assess the quality of the English-Arabic systems, by ranking sentences relative to each other, from the best to the worst (ties are allowed).",
        "We use the Appraise toolkit (Federmann, 2012) designed for manual MT evaluation.",
        "The tool displays to the annotator, the source sentence and translations produced by various MT systems.",
        "The annotators received initial training on the tool and the task with ten sentences.",
        "They were presented with a brief guideline indicating the purpose of the task and the main criteria of MT output evaluation.",
        "Each annotator was assigned to 22 ranking tasks.",
        "Each task included ten screens.",
        "Each screen involveed ranking translations of ten sentences.",
        "In total, we collected 22, 000 rankings for 1892 sen-208 tences (22 tasks?10 screens?10 judges).",
        "In each annotation screen, the annotator was shown the source-language (English) sentences, as well as five translations to be ranked.",
        "We did not provide annotators with the reference to avoid any bias in the annotation process.",
        "Each source sentence was presented with its direct context.",
        "Rather than attempting to get a complete ordering over the sys-tems, we instead relied on random selection and a reasonably large sample size to make the comparisons fair (Callison-Burch et al., 2011).",
        "An example of a source sentence and its five translations to be ranked is given in Table 2.",
        "3.3 Annotation quality and analysis In order to ensure the validity of any evaluation setup, a reasonable of inter- and intra-annotator agreement rates in ranking should exist.",
        "To measure these agreements, we deliberately reassigned 10% of the tasks to second annotators.",
        "More-over, we ensured that 10% of the screens are redisplayed to the same annotator within the same task.",

        "BLEU uses an exact n-gram matching criterion that is too strict for a morphologically rich language like Arabic.",
        "The system outputs in Table 2 are examples of how BLEU heavily penalizes Arabic.",
        "Based on BLEU, the best hypothesis is from Sys 5 which has three unigram and one bigram exact matches with the reference.",
        "However, the sentence is the 4 th ranked by annotators.",
        "In contrast, the output of Sys 3 (ranked 1 st by annotators) has only one exact match, but several partial matches when morphological and lexical information are taken into consideration.",
        "We propose the Arabic Language BLEU (AL- BLEU) metric which extends BLEU to deal with Arabic rich morphology.",
        "We extend the matching to morphological, syntactic and lexical levels with an optimized partial credit.",
        "AL-BLEU starts with the exact matching of hypothesis tokens against the reference tokens.",
        "Furthermore, it considers the following: (a) morphological and syntactic feature matching, (b) stem matching.",
        "Based on Arabic linguistic intuition, we check the matching of a subset of 5 morphological features: (i) POS tag, (ii) gender (iii) number (iv) person (v) definiteness.",
        "We use the MADA package (Habash et al., 2009) to collect the stem and the morphological features of the hypothesis and reference translation.",
        "Figure 1 summarizes the function in which we consider partial matching (m(t h , t r )) of a hypothesis token (t h ) and its associated reference token (t r ).",
        "Starting with the BLEU criterion, we first check if the hypothesis token is same as the reference one and provide the full credit for it.",
        "If the exact matching fails, we provide partial credit for matching at the stem and morphological level.",
