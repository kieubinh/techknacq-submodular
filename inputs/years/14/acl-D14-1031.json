        "Child semantic development includes the acquisition of word-to-concept mappings (part of word learning), and the formation of semantic connections among words/concepts.",
        "There is considerable evidence that understanding the semantic properties of words improves child vocabulary acquisition.",
        "In particular, children are sensitive to commonalities of semantic categories, and this abstract knowledge facilitates subsequent word learning (Jones et al., 1991; Colunga and Smith, 2005).",
        "Furthermore, representation of semantic knowledge is significant as it impacts how word meanings are stored in, searched for, and retrieved from memory (Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005; Griffiths et al., 2007).",
        "Semantic knowledge is often represented as a graph (a semantic network) in which nodes correspond to words/concepts 1 , and edges specify 1 Here we assume that the nodes of a semantic network are word forms and its edges are determined by the semantic features of those words.",
        "the semantic relations (Collins and Loftus, 1975; Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005).",
        "Steyvers and Tenenbaum (2005) demonstrated that a semantic network that encodes adult-level knowledge of words exhibits a small-world and scale-free structure.",
        "That is, it is an overall sparse network with highly-connected local sub-networks, where these sub-networks are connected through high-degree hubs (nodes with many neighbours).",
        "Much experimental research has investigated the underlying mechanisms of vocabulary learning and characteristics of semantic knowledge (Quine, 1960; Bloom, 1973; Carey and Bartlett, 1978; Gleitman, 1990; Samuelson and Smith, 1999; Jones et al., 1991; Jones and Smith, 2005).",
        "However, existing computational models focus on certain aspects of semantic acquisition: Some researchers develop computational models of word learning without considering the acquisition of semantic connections that hold among words, or how this semantic knowledge is structured (Siskind, 1996; Regier, 2005; Yu and Bal-lard, 2007; Frank et al., 2009; Fazly et al., 2010).",
        "Another line of work is to model formation of semantic categories but this work does not take into account how word meanings/concepts are acquired (Anderson and Matessa, 1992; Griffiths et al., 2007; Fountain and Lapata, 2011).",
        "Our goal in this work is to provide a cognitively-plausible and unified account for both acquiring and representing semantic knowledge.",
        "The requirements for cognitive plausibility enforce some constraints on a model to ensure that it is comparable with the cognitive process it is formulating (Poibeau et al., 2013).",
        "As we model semantic ac-quisition, the first requirement is incrementality, which means that the model learns gradually as it processes the input.",
        "Also, there is a limit on the number of computations the model performs at each step.",
        "In this paper, we present an algorithm for si-244 multaneously learning word meanings and growing a semantic network, which adheres to the cognitive plausibility requirements of incrementality and limited computations.",
        "We examine networks created by our model under various conditions, and explore what is required to obtain a structure that has appropriate semantic connections and has a small-world and scale-free structure.",
        "2 Related Work Models of Word Learning.",
        "Given a word learning scenario, there are potentially many possible mappings between words in a sentence and their meanings (real-world referents), from which only some mappings are correct (the mapping prob-lem).",
        "One of the most dominant mechanisms proposed for vocabulary acquisition is cross-situational learning: people learn word meanings by recognizing and tracking statistical regularities among the contexts of a word's usage across various situations, enabling them to narrow in on the meaning of a word that holds across its usages (Siskind, 1996; Yu and Smith, 2007; Smith and Yu, 2008).",
        "A number of computational models attempt to solve the mapping problem by implementing this mechanism, and have successfully replicated different patterns observed in child word learning (Siskind, 1996; Yu and Bal-lard, 2007; Fazly et al., 2010).",
        "These models have provided insight about underlying mechanisms of word learning, but none of them consider the semantic relations that hold among words, or how the semantic knowledge is structured.",
        "Recently, we have investigated properties of the semantic structure of the resulting (final) acquired knowledge of such a learner (Nematzadeh et al., 2014).",
        "However, that work did not address how such structural knowledge might develop and evolve incrementally within the learning model.",
        "Models of Categorization.",
        "Computational models of categorization focus on the problem of forming semantic clusters given a defined set of features for words (Anderson and Matessa, 1992; Griffiths et al., 2007; Sanborn et al., 2010).",
        "Anderson and Matessa (1992) note that a cognitively plausible categorization algorithm needs to be incremental and only keep track of one potential partitioning; they propose a Bayesian framework (the Rational Model of Categorization or RMC) that specifies the joint distribution on features and category labels, and allows an unbounded number of clusters.",
        "Sanborn et al. (2010) examine different categorization models based on RMC.",
        "In par-ticular, they compare the performance of the approximation algorithm of Anderson and Matessa (1992) (local MAP) with two other approximation algorithms (Gibbs Sampling and Particle Filters) in various human categorization paradigms.",

        "The Representation of Semantic Knowledge.",
        "There is limited work on computational models of semantic acquisition that examine the representation of the semantic knowledge.",
        "Steyvers and Tenenbaum (2005) propose an algorithm for building a network with small-world and scale-free structure.",
        "The algorithm starts with a small complete graph, incrementally adds new nodes to the graph, and for each new node uses a probabilistic mechanism for selecting a subset of current nodes to connect to.",
        "However, their approach does not address the problem of learning word meanings or the semantic connections among them.",
        "Fountain and Lapata (2011) propose an algorithm for learning categories that also creates a semantic network by comparing all the possible word pairs.",
        "How-ever, they too do not address the word learning problem, and do not investigate the structure of the learned semantic network to see whether it has the properties observed in adult knowledge.",
        "3 The Incremental Network Model We propose here a model that unifies the incremental acquisition of word meanings and formation of a semantic network structure that reflects the similarities among those meanings.",
        "We use an existing model to learn the meanings of words (Section 3.1), and use those incrementally developing meanings as the input to the algorithm proposed here for gradually growing a semantic network (Section 3.2).",

        "The word learner is an instance of cross-situational learning applied to a sequence of such input pairs: for each pair of a word w and a semantic feature f , the model incrementally learns P (f |w) from co-occurrences of w and f across all the utterance-scene pairs.",
        "For each word, the probability distribution over all semantic features, P (.|w), represents the word's meaning.",
        "The estimation of P (.|w) is made possible by introducing a set of latent vari-ables, alignments, that correspond to the possible mappings between words and features in a given utterance?scene pair.",
        "The learning problem is then to find the mappings that best explain the data, which is solved by using an incremental version of the expectation?maximization (EM) algorithm (Neal and Hinton, 1998).",

        "3.2 Growing a Semantic Network In our extended model, as we learn words incrementally (as above), we also structure those words into a semantic network based on the (partially) learned meanings.",
        "At any given point in time, the network will include as its nodes all the word types the word learner has been exposed to.",
        "Weighted edges (capturing semantic distance) will connect those pairs of word types whose learned meanings at that point are sufficiently semantically similar (according to a threshold).",
        "Since the probabilistic meaning of a word is adjusted each time it is observed, a word may either lose or gain connections in the network after each input is processed.",
        "Thus, to incrementally develop the network, at each time step, our algorithm must both examine existing connections (to see which edges should be removed) and consider potential new connections (to see which edges should be added).",
        "A simple approach to achieve this is to examine the current semantic similarity between a word w in the input and all the current words in the net-work, and include edges between only those word pairs that are sufficiently similar.",
        "However, comparing w to all the words in the network each time it is observed is computationally intensive (and not cognitively plausible).",
        "We present an approach for incrementally growing a semantic network that limits the computations when processing each input word w; see Algorithm 1.",
        "After the meaning of w is updated, we first check all the words that w is currently (di- rectly) connected to, to see if any of those edges need to be removed, or have their weight adjusted.",
        "Next, to look for new connections forw, the idea is to select only a small subset of words, S , to which w will be compared.",
        "The challenge then is to select S in a way that will yield a network whose semantic structure reasonably approximates the network that would result from full knowledge of comparing w to all the words.",
        "Previous work has suggested picking ?impor- tant?",
        "words (e.g., high-degree words) independently of the target word w ?",
        "assuming these might be words for which a learner might need to understand their relationship to w in the future (Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005).",

        "The question now is how to find semantically similar words to w that are not already connected to w in the network.",
        "To do so, we incrementally track semantic similarity among words usages as their meanings are developing.",
        "Specifically we cluster word tokens (not types) according to their current word meanings.",
        "Since the probabilistic meanings of words are continually evolving, incremental clusters of word tokens can capture developing similarities among the various usages of a word type, and be a clue to which words (types) w might be similar to.",

        "Thus, the scores calculated with this measure are comparable with those of our learned network.",
        "Given the gold-standard similarity scores for each word pair, we evaluate the semantic connectivity of the network based on two performance measures: coefficient of correlation and the median rank of the first five gold-standard associates.",
        "Correlation is a standard way to compare two lists of similarity scores (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006).",
        "We create two lists, one containing the gold-standard similarity scores for all word pairs, and the other containing their corresponding learned similarity scores.",
        "We calculate the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, ?, between these two lists of similarity scores.",
        "Note that the learned similarity scores reflect the semantic distance among words whereas the WordNet scores reflect semantic closeness.",
        "Thus, a negative correlation is best in our evaluation, where the value of -1 corresponds to the maximum correlation.",

        "The random graph is generated by randomly rearranging the edges of the network under consideration (Er- dos and R?enyi, 1960).",

        "In a small-world net-work, this value d median is expected to be as small as that of a random graph: even though the random graph has edges more uniformly distributed, the small-world network has many locally-connected components which are connected via hubs.",
        "On the other hand, C avg is expected to be much higher in a small-world network compared to its corresponding random graph, because the edges of a random graph typically do not fall into clusters forming highly connected neighborhoods.",

We also include a third baseline, Random+Context, that picks half of the members of S randomly and half of them from the prior context.",
