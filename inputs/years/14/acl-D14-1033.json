        "In recent years, there are various competitions devoted to grammar error correction, such as the HOO-2011(Dale and Kilgarriff, 2011), HOO-2012(Dale et al., 2012) and the CoNLL-2013 shared task (Ng et al., 2013).",
        "There has been a lot of work addressing errors made by L2 learners.",
        "A significant proportion of the systems for grammar error correction train individual statistical models to correct each special kind of error word by word and ignore error interactions.",
        "These methods assume no interactions between different kinds of grammatical errors.",
        "In real problem settings errors are correlated, which makes grammar error correction much more difficult.",
        "Recent research begins to focus on the error interaction problem.",
        "For example, Wu and Ng (2013) decodes a global optimized result based on the individual correction confidence of each kind of errors.",
        "The individual correction confidence is still based on the noisy context.",
        "Rozovskaya and Roth (2013) uses a joint modeling approach, which considers corrections in phrase structures instead of words.",
        "For dependencies that are not covered by the joint learning model, Rozovskaya and Roth (2013) uses the results of Illinois system in the joint inference.",
        "These results are still at word level and are based on the noisy context.",
        "These systems can consider error inter-actions, however, the systems are complex and inefficient.",
        "In both Wu and Ng (2013) and Rozovskaya and Roth (2013), Integer Linear Programming (ILP) is used for decoding a global optimized result.",
        "In the worst case, the time complexity of ILP can be exponent.",
        "In contrast, we think a better grammar error correction system should correct grammatical errors at sentence level directly and efficiently.",
        "The system should correct as many kinds of errors as possible in a generalized framework, while allowing special models for some kinds of errors that we need to take special care.",
        "We cluster all error into two groups and correspondingly divide our system into two modules: the general module and the special module.",
        "In the general module, our system views each parsed sentence as a dependency tree.",
        "The system generates correction candidates for each node on the dependency tree.",
        "The correction can be made on the dependency tree globally.",
        "In this module, nearly all replacement errors related to verb form, noun form and subject-verb agreement errors can be considered.",
        "In the special module, two extra classification models are used to correct the determiner errors and preposition errors .",
        "The classifiers are also trained at tree node level.",
        "We take special care of these two kinds 266 of errors because these errors not only include replacement errors, but also include insertion and deletion errors.",
        "A classification model is more suitable for handling insertion and deletion errors.",
        "Besides, they are the most common errors made by English as a Second Language (ESL) learners and are much easier to be incorporated into a classification framework.",
        "We propose a TreeNode Language Model (TNLM) to efficiently measure the correctness of selecting a correction candidate of a node in the general module.",
        "Similar to the existing statistical language models which assign a probability to a linear chain of words, our TNLM assigns correctness scores directly on each node on the dependency tree.",
        "We select candidates for each node to maximize the global correctness score and use these candidates to form the corrected sentence.",
        "The global optimized inference can be tackled efficiently using dynamic programming.",
        "Because the decoding is based on the whole sentence, error interactions can be considered.",
        "Our TNLM only needs to use context words related to each node on the dependency tree.",
        "Training a TreeNode language model costs no more than training ordinary language models on the same corpus.",

        "2 Task and System Overview 2.1 Task Description The task of grammar error correction aims to correct grammatical errors in sentences.",
        "There are various competitions devoted to the grammar error correction task for L2 learners.",
        "The CoNLL-2013 shared task is one of the most famous, which focuses on correcting five types of errors that are commonly made by non-native speakers of English, including determiner, preposition, noun number, subject-verb agreement and verb form errors.",
        "The training data released by the task organizers come from the NUCLE corpus(Dahlmeier et al., 2013).",
        "This corpus contains essays written by ESL learners, which are then corrected by English teachers.",
        "The test data are 50 student essays.",
        "Details of the corpus are described in Ng et al. (2013).",
        "2.2 System Architecture In our system, lists of correction candidates are first generated for each word.",
        "We generate candidates for nouns based on their plurality.",
        "We generate candidates for verbs based on their tenses.",
        "Then we select the correction candidates that maximize the overall correctness score.",
        "An example process of correcting figure 1(a) is shown in table 1.",
        "Correcting grammatical errors using local statistical models on word sequence is insufficient.",
        "The local models can only consider the contexts in a fixed window.",
        "In the example of figure 1(a), the context of the verb ?is?",
        "is ?that boy is on the?, which sounds reasonable at first glance but is incorrect when considering the whole sentence.",
        "The limitation of local classifiers is that long distance syntax information cannot be incorporated within the local context.",
        "In order to effectively use the syntax information to get a more accurate correcting result, we think a better way is to tackle the problem directly at tree level to view the sentence as a whole.",
        "From figure 1(a) we can see that the node ?is?",
        "has two children on the dependency tree: ?books?",
        "and ?on?.",
        "When we consider the node ?is?, its context is ?books is on?, which sounds incorrect.",
        "Therefore, we can make better corrections using such context information on nodes.",
        "Therefore, our system corrects grammatical errors on dependency trees directly.",
        "Because the correlated of words are more linked on trees than in a word sequence, the errors are more easier to be corrected on the trees and the agreement of different error types is guaranteed by the edges.",
        "We follow the strategy of treating different kinds of errors differently, which is used by lots of grammar error correction systems.",
        "We cluster the five types of errors considered in CoNLL-2013 into two groups and divide our system into two modules correspondingly.",
        "?",
        "The general module, which is responsible for the verb form errors, noun number errors and subject-verb agreement errors.",
        "These errors are all replacement errors, which can be corrected by replacing the wrongly used word with a reasonable candidate word.",

        "We take special care of these two kinds of errors because these errors include both replacement errors and insertion/deletion errors.",
        "Be-sides, they are the most common errors made by ESL learners and is much easier to be incorporated into a classification framework.",
        "We should make it clear that we are not the first to use tree level correction models on ungrammatical sentences.",
        "Yoshimoto et al. (2013) uses a Treelet Language model (Pauls and Klein, 2012) to correct agreement errors.",
        "However, the performance of Treelet language model is not that good compared with the top-ranked system in CoNLL-2013.",
        "The reason is that the production rules in the Treelet language model are based on complex con-texts, which will exacerbate the data sparseness problem.",
        "The ?context?",
        "in Treelet language model also include words ahead of treelets, which are sometimes unrelated to the current node.",
        "In con-trast, our TreeNode Language model only needs to consider useful context words related to each node on the dependency tree.",
        "To train a TreeNode language model costs no more than training ordinary language models on the same corpus.",
        "2.3 Data Preparation Our system corrects grammatical errors on dependency trees directly, therefore the sentences in training and testing data should have been parsed before being corrected.",
        "In our system, we use the Stanford parser 1 to parse the New York Times source of the Gigaword corpus 2 , and use the parsed sentences as our training data.",
        "We use the original training data provided by CoNLL-2013 as the develop set to tune all parameters.",
        "Some sentences in the news texts use a different writing style against the sentences written by ESL learners.",
        "For example, sentences written by ESL learners seldom include dialogues between people, while very often news texts include paragraphs such as ?",
        "?I am frightened!?",
        "cried Tom?.",
        "We use heuristic rules to eliminate the sentences in the Gigaword corpus that are less likely to appear in the ESL writing.",

        "In total we select and parse 5 million sentences of the New York Times source of English newswire in the Gigaword corpus.",
        "We build the system and experiment based on these sentences.",
        "3 The General Module 3.1 Overview The general module aims to correct verb form er-rors, noun number errors and subject-verb agreement errors.",
        "Other replacement errors such as spelling errors can also be incorporated into the general module.",
        "Here we focus on verb form er-rors, noun number errors and subject-verb agreement errors only.",
        "Our general module views each sentence as a dependency tree.",
        "All words in the sentence form the nodes of the tree.",
        "Nodes are linked through directed edges, annotated with the dependency relations.",
        "Before correcting the grammatical errors, the general module should generate correction candidates for each node first.",
        "For each node we use the word itself as its first candidate.",
        "Because the general module considers errors related to verbs and nouns, we generate extra correction candidates only for verbs and nouns.",
        "For verbs we use all its verb forms as its extra candidates.",
        "For example when considering the word ?speaks?, we use itself and {speak, spoke, spoken, speaking} as its correction candidates.",
        "For nouns we use its singular form and plural form as its extra correction candidates.",
        "For example when considering the word ?dog?, we use itself and ?dogs?",
        "as its correction candidate.",
        "If the system selects the original word as the final correction, the sentence remains unchanged.",
        "But for convenience we still call the newly generated sentence ?the corrected sentence?.",
        "In a dependency tree, the whole sentence s can be formulized as a list of production rules r 1 , ..., r L of the form: [r = head ?",
        "modifier 1 ,modifier 2 ...].",
        "An example of all production rules of figure 1(a) is shown in table 2.",
        "Because the production rules are made up of words, selecting a different correction candidate for only one node will result in a list of different 3 In our experiment, no less than 5 words and no more than 30 words.",
        "production rules.",
        "For example, figure 1(b) selects the correction candidate ?is?",
        "to replace the original ?are?.",
        "Therefore the production rules of figure 1(b) include [are ?",
        "books, on], instead of [is ?",

        "For the first problem, we propose a TreeNode Language Model as the correctness measure of a fixed candidate selection.",
        "For the decoding prob-lem, we use a dynamic programming method to efficiently find the correction candidates that maximize the overall score.",
        "We will describe the details in the following sections.",
        "One concern is whether the automatically parsed trees are reliable for grammar error correction.",
        "We define ?reliable?",
        "as follows.",
        "If we 269 change some words in original sentence into their reasonable correction candidates (e.g. change ?is?",
        "to ?are?)",
        "but the structure of the dependency tree does not change (except the replaced word and its corresponding POS tag, which are definitely changed), then we say the dependency tree is reliable for this sentence.",
        "To verify this we randomly selected 1000 sentences parsed by the Stanford Parser.",
        "We randomly select the verbs and nouns and replace them with a wrong form.",
        "We parsed the modified sentences again and asked 2 annotators to examine whether the dependency trees are reliable for grammar error correction.",
        "We find that 99% of the dependency trees are reliable.",
        "Therefore we can see that the dependency tree can be used as the structure for grammar error correction directly.",
        "3.2 TreeNode Language Model In our system we use the score of TreeNode Language Model (TNLM) as the scoring function.",
        "Consider a node n on a dependency tree and assume n has K modifiers C 1 , ..., C K as its child nodes.",
        "We define Seq(n) = [C 1 , ..., n, ..., C K ] as an ordered sub-sequence of nodes that includes the node n itself and all its child nodes.",
        "The order of the sub-sequence in Seq(n) is sorted based on their position in the sentence.",
        "In this formula-tion, we can score the correctness of a production rule r by scoring the correctness of Seq(n).",
        "Because Seq(n) is a word sequence, we can use a language model to measure its correctness.",
        "The sub-sequences are not identical to the original text.",
        "Therefore instead of using ordinary language models, we should train special language models using the sub-sequences to measure the correctness of a production rule.",
        "Take the sentence in figure 2 as an example.",
        "When considering the node ?is?",
        "in the word se-quence, it is likely to be corrected into ?are?",
        "because it appear directly after the plural noun ?par- ents?.",
        "However, by the definition above, the subsequence corresponding to the node ?damaged?",
        "is ?car is damaged by ?.",
        "In such context, the word ?is?",
        "is less likely to be changed to ?are?.",
        "From the example we can see that the sub-sequence is suitable to be used to measure the correctness of a production rule.",
        "From this example we can also find that the sub-sequences are different with ordinary sentences, because ordinary sentences are less likely to end with ?by?.",
        "Table 3 shows all the sub-sequences in the example of figure 2.",
        "If we collect all the sub-sequences in the corpus to form a new subsequence corpus, we can train a language model based on the new sub-sequence corpus.",
        "This is our TreeNode Language Model.",
        "One advantage of TLM is that once we have generated the sub-sequences, we can train the TLM in the same way as we train ordinary language models.",
        "Be-sides, the TLM is not limited to a fixed smoothing method.",
        "Any smoothing methods for ordinary language models are applicable for TLM.",
        "Node Sub-sentence The The car The car of of of parents my my parents my parents is is damaged car is damaged by by by storm the the storm the storm Table 3: All the sub-sentences in the example of figure 2 In our system we train the TLM using the same way as training tri-gram language model.",

        "i=1 C i .scores[j i ] (2) where TNLM(seq) is the TreeNode Language Model score of seq.",
        "Then, n.scores[i] is calculated as: n.scores[i] = max ?seq score(seq) (3) Because seq is a word sequence, the maximization can be efficiently calculated using Viterbi algorithm (Forney Jr, 1973).",
        "To be specific, the Viterbi algorithm uses the transition scores and emission scores as its input.",
        "The transition scores in our model are the tri-gram probabilities from our tri-gram TNLM.",
        "The emission scores in our model are the candidate scores of each child: C 1 .scores, ..., C K .scores, which have already been calculated.",
        "After the bottom-up calculation, we only need to look into the ?ROOT?",
        "node to find the maximum score of the whole tree.",
        "Similar to the Viterbi algorithm, back pointers should be kept to find which candidate is selected for the final corrected sentence.",

        "3.4 The Special Module The special module is designed for determiner errors and preposition errors.",
        "We take special care of these two kinds of errors because these errors include insertion and deletion errors, which cannot be corrected in the general module.",
        "Because there is a fixed number of prepositions and deter-miners, these two kinds of errors are much easier to be incorporated into a classification framework.",
        "Besides, they are the most common errors made by ESL learners and there are lots of previous works that leave valuable guidance for us to follow.",

        "Although some previous works (e.g. Rozovskaya et al. (2013)) use NPs and the head of NPs as 271 features, they are basically local classifiers making predictions on word sequences.",
        "Difference to the local classifier approaches, we make predictions on the nodes of the dependency tree directly.",
        "In our system we correct determiner errors and preposition errors separately.",
        "For the determiner errors, we consider the in-sertion, deletion and replacement of articles (i.e.",

        "Features used in the classification models include the context words, POS tags, language model scores (Gamon, 2010), and tree level features (Tetreault et al., 2010).",
        "Models used include maximum entropy (AEHAN et al., 2006; Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008), averaged percep-tron, Naive Bayes (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2011), etc.",
