        "Despite great progress over the past two decades on parsing, relatively little work has considered the problem of creating accurate parsers for low-resource languages.",
        "Existing work in this area focuses primarily on approaches that use some form of cross-lingual bootstrapping to improve performance.",
        "For instance, Hwa et al. (2005) use a parallel Chinese/English corpus and an English dependency grammar to induce an annotated Chinese corpus in order to train a Chinese dependency grammar.",
        "Kuhn (2004b) also considers the benefits of using multiple languages to induce a monolingual grammar, making use of a measure for data reliability in order to weight training data based on confidence of annotation.",
        "Bootstrapping approaches such as these achieve markedly improved results, but they are dependent on the existence of a parallel bilingual corpus.",
        "Very few such corpora are readily available, particularly for low-resource languages, and creating such corpora obviously presents a challenge for many practical applications.",
        "Kuhn (2004a) shows some of the difficulty in handling low-resource languages by examining various tasks using Q?anjob?al as an example.",
        "Another approach is that of Bender et al. (2002), who take a more linguistically-motivated approach by making use of linguistic universals to seed newly developed grammars.",
        "This substantially reduces the effort by making it unnecessary to learn the basic parameters of a lan-guage, but it lacks the robustness of grammars learned from data.",
        "Recent work on Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars with latent annotations (PCFG-LA) (Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006) have shown them to be effective models for syntactic parsing, especially when less training material is available (Liang et al., 2009; Shindo et al., 2012).",
        "The coarse nonterminal symbols found in vanilla PCFGs are refined by latent variables; these latent annotations can model subtypes of grammar symbols that result in better grammars and enable better estimates of grammar productions.",
        "In this pa-per, we provide a Gibbs sampler for learning PCFG-LA models and show its effectiveness for parsing low-resource languages such as Malagasy and Kinyawanda.",
        "Previous PCFG-LA work focuses on the problem of parameter estimation, including expectation-maximization (EM) (Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006), spectral learning (Cohen et al., 2012; Cohen et al., 2013), and variational inference (Liang et al., 2009; Wang and Blunsom, 2013).",
        "Regardless of inference method, previous work has used the same method to parse new sentences: a Viterbi parse under a new sentence-specific PCFG obtained from an approximation of the original grammar (Matsuzaki et al., 2005).",
        "Here, we provide an alternative approach to parsing new sentences: an extension of the Gibbs sampling algorithm of Johnson et al. (2007), which learns rule probabilities in an unsupervised PCFG.",
        "We use a Gibbs sampler to collect sampled trees theoretically distributed from the true posterior distribution in order to parse.",
        "Priors in a Bayesian model can control the sparsity of grammars (which the inside-outside algorithm fails to do), while naturally incorporating smoothing into the model (Johnson et al., 2007; Liang et al., 2009).",
        "We also build a Bayesian model for parsing with a treebank, and incorporate information from training data as a prior.",
        "Moreover, we extend the Gibbs sampler to learn and parse PCFGs with latent annotations.",
        "Learning the latent annotations is a compute-intensive process.",
        "We show how a small amount of training data can be used to bootstrap: after running a large number of sampling iterations on a small set, the resulting parameters are used to seed a smaller number of iterations on the full training data.",
        "290 This allows us to employ more latent annotations while maintaining reasonable training times and still making full use of the available training data.",
        "To determine the cross-linguistic applicability of these methods, we evaluate on a wide variety of languages with varying amounts of available training data.",
        "We use English and Chinese as examples of languages with high data availability, while Italian, Malagasy, and Kinyarwanda provide examples of languages with little available data.",
        "We find that our technique comes near state of the art results on large datasets, such as those for Chinese and English, and it provides excellent results on limited datasets ?",
        "both artificially limited in the case of En-glish, and naturally limited in the case of Italian, Mala-gasy, and Kinyarwanda.",
        "This, combined with its ability to run off-the-shelf on new languages without any supporting materials such as parallel corpora, make it a valuable technique for the parsing of low-resource languages.",
        "2 Gibbs sampling for PCFGs Our starting point is a Gibbs Sampling algorithm for vanilla PCFGs introduced by Johnson et al. (2007) for estimating rule probabilities in an unsupervised PCFG.",
        "We focus instead on using this algorithm for parsing new sentences and then extending it to learn PCFGs with latent annotations.",

        "An additional motivation for using this algorithm is that Johnson et al. use it for learning without annotated structures, and in future work we seek to learn from fewer, and at times partial, annotations.",
        "An advantage of using Gibbs sampling for Bayesian inference, as opposed to other approximation algorithms such as Variational Bayesian inference (VB) and Collapsed Variational Bayesian inference (CVB), is that Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are guaranteed to converge to a sample from the true posterior under appropriate conditions (Taddy, 2011).",
        "Both VB and CVB converge to inaccurate and locally optimal solutions, like EM.",
        "In some models, CVB can achieve more accurate results due to weaker assumptions (Wang and Blunsom, 2013).",
        "Another advantage of Gibbs sampling is that the sampler allows for parallel computation by allowing each sentence to be sampled entirely independently of the others.",
