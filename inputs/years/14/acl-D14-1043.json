        "The language employed in soccer commentaries is difficult to ground due to its dense information structure, novel vocabulary and word senses, and colorful, non-traditional syntax.",
        "These challenges conspire to foil most language processing techniques including automated parsers and word-sense disambiguation systems.",
        "In addition to the structural problems presented by the language of soccer commentaries, the problem of reference is further complicated by the fact that for game events (and other real-world phe-nomena) there is no standardized meaningful linguistic unit.",
        "Utterances ranging from a single word to multiple sentences can be used to refer to a single event.",
        "For example, in Figure 1 the first four words of commentary (I) refer to a single event, as does the entirety of (II).",

        "Turning our attention to Figure 2, sometimes a fragment refers to a combination of events and no further decomposition is available, such as the first fragment of commentary (I).",
        "Moreover, it is sometimes desirable to construct a complex of events by determining all the events corresponding to a particular collection of words.",
        "For instance, we would want to be able to align the whole of (I) with all the events in the corresponding dashed box.",
        "This suggests studying language grounding at multiple levels of granularity (resolutions).",
        "We use resolution to describe the continuum of meaningful units which exist in human language 2 .",
        "These resolutions interact in a complicated way, with clues from different resolutions sometimes combining to produce an effect and sometimes negating one another.",
        "With enough training data, one could hope to learn the details of the interactions of various resolutions.",
        "However, the expense of producing or obtaining supervised training data at multiple resolutions is prohibitive.",
        "To address all these complications, we introduce weakly-supervised multi-resolution language grounding.",
        "Our method makes use of a factorized objective function which allows us to model the complex interplay of resolutions.",
        "Our language model takes advantage of the discourse structure of the commentaries, making it robust enough to handle the unique language of the soccer domain.",

        "2 Challenges Syntactic Limitations: Syntax is used to structure the information provided by an utterance, and so it seems intuitive that syntactic relations could be leveraged in this task.",
        "For example, consider utterance (III) in Figure 2.",
        "The multi-resolution grounding of (III) would provide a segmentation of the utterance ?",
        "or a division of the utterance into the fragments which refer to separate events.",
        "In (III), there is an obvious syntactic correlate to the correct segmentation: each verb phrase within the conjunction headed by ?and?",
        "identifies a separate event.",
        "Parsing (III) to an event-based semantics like that of Davidson (1967), one could associate each verb in an utterance with a game event and achieve the desired segmentation.",
        "3 Our updated dataset is available at http://ssli.",
        "ee.washington.edu/tial/projects/multires/ 387 Unfortunately, there is a preponderance of examples such as (II) in Figure 2, where 4 verbs are used to describe a single ?miss?",
        "event.",
        "(II) illustrates just one of the many difficulties of using syntactic information ?",
        "elsewhere, events are referenced without an explicit verb whatsoever (such as the use of the phrase ?into the books?",
        "to refer to a foul event).",
        "What is needed instead is a language model that is powerful enough to proscribe some structure yet robust enough to allow the world representation to determine which pieces of language are referring to which referent or set of referents.",
        "Complex Interplay between Resolutions: Language refers at a variety of resolutions, and the relationship between nested reference scopes is complex.",
        "A single or few words can indicate entities or properties; full phrases are often needed to denote an action; complex events like a missed shot may take up to several phrases of narration to properly describe.",
        "A soccer commentator does not encode every detail necessary for proper alignment and segmentation into their utterances, but rather only enough to make clear to another with similar world knowledge what is meant.",
        "A language grounding method is at a severe disadvantage when faced with such implicit information.",
        "Instead, a successful method can make heavy use of the limited lexical, phrasal, and discourse structural cues provided in an utterance, as the different resolutions rely on these different contextual clues to meaning.",
        "At finer resolutions one can rely more on the lexical meanings of the words; at medium resolutions, compositionality can be leveraged; at coarser resolutions, discourse features come into play.",
        "These cues interact in a complicated way, providing additional challenge.",
        "Consider again Figure 2.",
        "In (III), the temporal discourse marker ?and?",
        "marks the division between the fragments referring to each event.",
        "In (I) the same word (used again as a temporal discourse marker) is used to elaborate on the single ?foul?",
        "event being described in the second fragment.",
        "A human (with sufficient understanding of soccer) knows that, despite being separated by the discourse marker, the phrases ?bring him down?",
        "and ?set piece?",
        "both refer to the foul.",
        "A language grounding algorithm that can model the interaction between such word-level and utterance-level cues can successfully segment both (I) and (III).",
        "Supervision: For language grounding generally, and multi-resolution grounding specifically, supervised training data is expensive to produce.",
        "Also, the various grounding domains of interest are highly independent of one another (Liang et al., 2009).",
        "In the face of these issues, the ideal correspondence between language and world representation would be learned with as little supervision as possible.",
        "3 Problem Definition We define the problem of multi-resolution language grounding as follows: Given a temporal evolution of a world state (a sequence of events) and an overlapping natural language text (a sequence of utterances), we want to learn the best correspondences between the language and the world at different levels of granularity (Figure 2).",
        "To set up notations, for each utterance represented as a set of words W = {w 1 , w 2 , .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", w n }, we want a segmentation which expresses the relationship of the words to the events which they describe.",
        "Let S denote a set of all possible segmentations of W .",
        "Then S = {S|S is a segmentation of W}.",
        "A segmentation S is in turn a set of non-overlapping fragments (S = {s i }), where each fragment is a consecutive sequence of words from the utterance W .",
        "For example, for utterance (III) from Figure 2, one possible (incorrect) segmentation is S = {s 1 , s 2 , s 3 } for s 1 ={Chamakh rises highest}, s 2 ={and aims a header}, and s 3 = {to- wards goal which is narrowly wide}.",
        "An alignment consists of a segmentation S and a mapping E from fragments of S to the set of all events E. For example, the segmentation S could be mapped as E = {'s 1 , e 2 ?, 's 2 , e 3 ?, 's 3 , e 1 ?",
        "}, with e 1 being an Aerial Challenge, e 2 being a missed attempt on goal, and e 3 being an out of bounds penalty.",
        "Let E = S ?",
        "E denote the set of all possible alignments.",
        "As we show in Figure 2, events are composed of the various attributes Time, Type, Pass Events, Outcome, and Player.",
        "For example, the aerial event in Figure 2 has the attributes and values type:aerial, outcome:successful, pass events:head pass, and player:Chamakh.",
        "Finally, we denote the values for the attributes of each e j as e a j , where a ranges over the different attributes of events as represented in the data.",
        "We define the multi-resolution grounding of W 388 into E as the best segmentation S and alignment E that maximize the joint probability distribution: arg max S?S,E?E P (S,E|W ) (1) This optimization 4 can be accomplished through the use of supervised learning.",
        "However, training data is expensive and tedious to produce for the grounding problem, especially at multiple resolutions.",
        "Additionally, the complexity of the language in this domain would result in very sparse associations.",
        "Yet if we knew some of the correct fine-resolution alignments, we could use that information to produce good coarse resolution alignments, and vice versa.",
        "Therefore, we formulate a factorized form of the above objective which allows us to learn features specific to aligning at the ut-terance, fragment, and attribute resolutions.",
        "Our method can be optimized with only weak supervision (loose temporal alignments between utterances and a set of events occurring within a window of the utterance time).",
        "We can evaluate such a correspondence in several ways.",
        "For each utterance, can we predict the correct events to which this utterance refers?",
        "This is the problem of utterance-level alignment.",
        "We can also evaluate based on events: for each event, can we identify the minimal text span(s) which refers to this event?",
        "We want a tight correspondence because loose, overlapping alignments are not semantically satisfying.",
        "However, we do not want to under associate: human language makes reference at a variety of levels (the word level, the phrase level, the utterance level, and be-yond).",
        "It is important to correctly identify all and only the words which correspond to a given event.",
        "This is the fragment-level alignment problem.",
        "We show that good fragment-level alignments will improve utterance-level alignment, and vice versa.",
        "Since events are composed of their attributes, we can imagine a very fine resolution grounding of individual words to individual attributes.",

        "The utterance-level alignment uses this association already, aligning utterances containing the word ?header?",
        "with events that have a pass events:head pass attribute.",
        "At a finer-resolution, it is necessary to make a different distinction between events.",
        "Our method finds that the presence of the word ?header?",

        "Commentators often describe facts about players or the weather or previous games which have no extension in the current game.",
        "However, our system cannot distinguish such language from the language referring to this game.",
        "This is a good avenue for future exploration.",
        "The second set of errors we make in fragmentation are caused by bad event priors.",
        "Our current setup cannot increase recall: we can only improve the precision of the utterance-level alignments we are given.",
        "Therefore, if an event is overlooked in the first-pass of utterance-level alignments, we cannot reintroduce it through a fragment alignment.",
