        "Spoken Language Understanding aims to interpret user utterances and to convert them to logical forms or, equivalently, to database queries, which can then be used to satisfy the user's information needs.",
        "This process is known as Concept Segmentation and Labeling (CSL), also called semantic parsing in the speech community: it maps utterances into meaning representations based on semantic constituents.",
        "The latter are basically word sequences, often referred to as concepts, attributes or semantic tags.",
        "CSL makes it easy to convert spoken questions such as ?cheap lebanese restaurants in doha with take out?",
        "into database queries.",
        "First, a language-specific semantic parser tok-enizes, segments and labels the question: [ Price cheap] [ Cuisine lebanese] [ Other restaurants in] [ City doha] [ Other with] [ Amenity take out] Then, label-specific normalizers are applied to the segments, with the option to possibly relabel mislabeled segments: [ Price low] [ Cuisine lebanese] [ City doha] [ Amenity carry out] Finally, a database query is formed from the list of labels and values, and is then executed against the database, e.g., MongoDB; a backoff mechanism may be used if the query has not succeeded.",
        "{$and [{cuisine:\"lebanese\"},{city:\"doha\"}, {price:\"low\"},{amenity:\"carry out\"}]} The state-of-the-art of CSL is represented by conditional models for sequence labeling such as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) trained with simple morphological and lexical features.",
        "The basic CRF model was improved by means of reranking (Moschitti et al., 2006; Dinarelli et al., 2012) using structural kernels (Moschitti, 2006).",
        "Although these methods exploited sentence structure, they did not use syntax at all.",
        "More recently, we applied shallow syntactic structures and discourse parsing with slightly better results (Saleh et al., 2014).",
        "How-ever, the most obvious models for semantic pars-ing, i.e., rerankers based on semantic structural kernels (Bloehdorn and Moschitti, 2007b), had not been applied to semantic structures yet.",
        "In this paper, we study the impact of semantic information conveyed by Brown Clusters (BCs) (Brown et al., 1992) and semantic similarity, while also combining them with innovative features.",
        "We use reranking, similarly to (Saleh et al., 2014), to select the best hypothesis annotated with concepts predicted by a local model.",
        "The competing hypotheses are represented as innovative trees enriched with the semantic concepts and BC labels.",
        "The trees can capture dependencies between sentence constituents, concepts and BCs.",
        "However, extracting explicit features from them is rather difficult as their number is exponentially large.",
        "Thus, we rely on (i) Support Vector Machines (Joachims, 1999) to train the reranking functions and on (ii) structural kernels (Moschitti, 2010; Moschitti, 2012; Moschitti, 2013) to automatically encode tree fragments that represent syntactic and semantic dependencies from words and concepts.",
        "436 (a) Semantic Kernel Structure (SKS) (b) SKS with Brown Clusters Figure 1: CSL structures: standard and with Brown Clusters.",
        "We further apply a semantic kernel (SK), namely the Smoothed Partial Tree Kernel (Croce et al., 2011), which uses the lexical similarity between the tree nodes, while computing the substructure space.",
        "This is the first time that SKs are applied to reranking hypotheses.",
        "This (i) makes the global sentence structure along with concepts available to the learning algorithm, and (ii) enables computing the similarity between lexicals in syntactic patterns that are enriched by concepts.",
        "We tested our models on the Restaurant domain.",
        "Our results show that: (i) The basic CRF parser, which uses semi-Markov CRF, or semi-CRF (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004), is already very accurate; it achieves F 1 scores over 83%, making any further improvement very hard.",
        "(ii) The upper-bound performance of the reranker is very high as well, i.e., the correct annotation is generated in the list of the first 100 hypotheses in 98.72% of the cases.",
        "(iii) SKs significantly improve over the semi-CRF baseline and our previous state-of-the-art reranker exploiting shallow syntactic patterns (Saleh et al., 2014), as shown by extensive comparisons using several systems.",
        "(iv) Making BCs effective requires a deeper study.",
        "2 Related Work One of the early approaches to CSL was that of Pieraccini et al. (1991), where the word sequences and concepts were modeled using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) as observations and hidden states, respectively.",
        "Generative models were exploited by Seneff (1989) and Miller et al. (1994), who used stochastic grammars for CSL.",
        "Other discriminative models followed such preliminary work, e.g., (Rubinstein and Hastie, 1997; Santaf?e et al., 2007; Raymond and Riccardi, 2007).",
        "CRF-based models are considered to be the state of the art in CSL (De Mori et al., 2008).",
        "Another relevant line of research are the semantic kernels, i.e., kernels that use lexical similarity between features.",
        "One of the first that applyed LSA was (Cristianini et al., 2002), whereas (Bloe- hdorn et al., 2006; Basili et al., 2006) used Word-Net.",
        "Semantic structural kernels of the type we use in this paper were first introduced in (Bloe- hdorn and Moschitti, 2007a; Bloehdorn and Mos-chitti, 2007b).",
        "The most advanced model based on tree kernels, which we also use in this paper, is the Smoothed PTK (Croce et al., 2011).",
        "3 Reranking for CSL Reranking is applied to a list of N annotation hy-potheses, which are generated and sorted by the probability to be globally correct as estimated using local classifiers or global classifiers that only use local features.",
        "Then, a reranker, typically a meta-classifier, tries to select the best hypothesis from the list.",
        "The reranker can exploit global information, and specifically, the dependencies between the different concepts, which are made available by the local model.",
        "We use semi-CRFs for the local model as they yield the highest accuracy in CSL (when using a single model) and preference reranking for the global reranker.",

        "), where S TK computes one of the tree kernel functions defined in 3.2 and 3.3; and S v is a kernel (see 3.4), e.g., linear, polynomial, Gaussian, etc.",
        "3.2 Tree kernels (TKs) TKs measure the similarity between two structures in terms of the number of substructures they share.",
        "We use two types of tree kernels: (i) Partial Tree Kernel (PTK), which can be effectively applied to both constituency and dependency parse trees (Moschitti, 2006).",
        "It generates all possible connected tree fragments, e.g., sibling nodes can be also separated and can be part of different tree fragments: a fragment is any possible tree path, and other tree paths are allowed to depart from its nodes.",
        "Thus, it can generate a very rich feature space.",
        "(ii) The smoothed PTK or semantic kernel (SK) (Croce et al., 2011), which extends PTK by allowing soft matching (i.e., via similarity compu-tation) between nodes associated with different but related lexical items.",
        "The node similarity can be derived from manually annotated resources, e.g., WordNet or Wikipedia, as well as using corpus-based clustering approaches, e.g., latent semantic analysis (LSA), as we do in this paper.",
        "3.3 Semantic structures Tree kernels allow us to compute structural similarities between two trees; thus, we engineered a special structure for the CSL task.",
        "In order to capture the structural dependencies between the semantic tags, 1 we use a basic tree (see for example Figure 1a), where the words of a sentence are tagged with their semantic tags.",
        "1 They are associated with the following IDs: 0-Other, 1-Rating, 2-Restaurant, 3-Amenity, 4-Cuisine, 5-Dish, 6- Hours, 7-Location, and 8-Price.",
        "More specifically, the words in the sentence constitute the leaves of the tree, which are in turn connected to the pre-terminals containing the semantic tags in BIO notation (?B?=begin, ?I?=inside, ?O?=outside).",
        "The BIO tags are then generalized in the upper level, and joined to the Root node.",
        "Additionally, part-of-speech (POS) tags 2 are added to each word by concatenating it with the string ?",
        "::L?, where L is the first letter of the POS-tags of the words, e.g., along, my and route, receive i, p and n, which are the first letters of the POS-tags IN, PRN and NN, respectively.",
        "SK applied to the above structure can generate powerful semantic patterns such as [Root [4-Cuisine [similar to(stake house)]][7-Loc [simi- lar to(within a mile)]]], e.g., for correctly labeling new clauses like Pizza Parlor in three kilometers.",
        "The BC labels, represented as cluster IDs, are simply added as siblings of words as shown in Fig. 1b.",
        "3.4 Feature Vectors For the sake of comparison, we also devoted some effort towards engineering a set of features to be used in a flat feature-vector representation.",
        "These features can be used in isolation to learn the reranking function, or in combination with the kernel-based approach (as a composite kernel using a linear combination).",
        "They belong to the following four categories: (i) CRF-based: these include the basic features used to train the initial semi-CRF model; (ii) n-gram based: we collected 3- and 4-grams of the output label sequence at the level of concepts, with artificial tags inserted to identify the start (?S?)",
        "and end (?E?)",
        "of the sequence.",
        "3 (iii) Probability-based, computing the probability of the label sequence as an average of the probabilities at the word level in the N -best list; and (iv) DB-based: a single feature encoding the number of results returned from the database when constructing a query using the conjunction of all semantic segments in the hypothesis.",
        "4 Experiments The experiments aim at investigating the role of feature vectors, PTK, SK and BCs in reranking.",
        "We first describe the experimental setting and then we move into the analysis of the results.",
        "2 We use the Stanford tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003).",
        "3 For instance, if the output sequence is Other-Rating-Other-Amenity the 3-gram patterns would be: S-Other-Rating, Other-Rating-Other, Rating-Other-Amenity, and Other-Amenity-E. 438 Train Devel.",

        "We subsequently split the training data randomly into 10 folds.",
        "We used cross-validation, i.e., iteratively training with 9 folds and annotating the remaining fold, in order to generate the N -best lists of hypotheses for the entire training dataset.",
        "We computed the 100-best hypotheses for each example.",
        "We then used the development dataset to test and tune the hyper-parameters of our reranking model.",

        "Data representation.",

        "Learning algorithm.",
        "We used the SVM-Light-TK 5 to train the reranker with a combination of tree kernels and feature vectors (Moschitti, 2006; Joachims, 1999).",

        "As a baseline, we picked the best-scoring hypothesis in the list, i.e., the output by the regular semi-CRF parser.",

        "Going up to 10-best lists only adds 2.5 extra F 1 points.",
        "The complete 100-best lists add 3.5 extra F 1 points, for a total of 98.72.",

        "The semantic kernel significantly improves over the semi-CRF baseline and our previous state-of-the-art reranker exploiting shallow syntactic patterns (Saleh et al., 2014), which corresponds to PTK+all in the above comparison.",
        "8 Models are split between 2 plots in order to ease reading.",
        "The improvement falls between 1-2 absolute percent points.",
        "This is remarkable as (i) it corresponds to ?10% relative error reduction, and (ii) the state-of-the-art baseline system is very difficult to beat, as confirmed by the low impact of traditional features and BCs.",
        "Although the latter can generalize over concepts and words, their use is not straightforward, resulting in no improvement.",
        "In the future, we plan to investigate the use of semantic similarity from distributional and other sources (Mihalcea et al., 2006; Padó and Lapata, 2007), e.g., Wikipedia (Strube and Ponzetto, 2006; Mihalcea and Csomai, 2007), Wiktionary (Zesch et al., 2008), WordNet (Pedersen et al., 2004; Agirre et al., 2009), FrameNet, VerbNet (Shi and Mihalcea, 2005), BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2010), and LSA, and for different domains.",

        "We would like to thank Danilo Croce, Roberto Basili and Giuseppe Castellucci for helping and providing us with the similarity matrix for the semantic kernels.",
