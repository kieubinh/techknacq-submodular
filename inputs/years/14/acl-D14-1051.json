        "Nonetheless, these documents may contain more than one main theme, and their automatic transcription inevitably contains errors.",

        "Firstly, various topic spaces are estimated with different numbers of classes from a Latent Dirichlet Allocation.",
        "Then, this multiple topic space representation is compacted into an elementary seg-ment, called c-vector, originally developed in the context of speaker recognition.",
        "Experiments are conducted on the DECODA corpus of conversations.",
        "Results show the effectiveness of the proposed multi-view compact representation paradigm.",
        "Our identification system reaches an accuracy of 85%, with a significant gain of 9 points compared to the baseline (best single topic space configuration)."

        "Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems frequently fail on noisy conditions and high Word Error Rates (WER) make the analysis of the automatic transcriptions difficult.",
        "Speech analytics suffer from these transcription issues that may be overcome by improving the ASR robustness and/or the tolerance of speech analytic systems to ASR errors.",
        "This paper proposes a new method to improve the robustness of speech analytics by combining a semantic multi-model approach and a noise reduction technique based on the i-vector paradigm.",
        "This method is evaluated in the application framework of the RATP call centre (Paris Public Transportation Authority), focusing on the theme identification task (Bechet et al., 2012).",
        "Telephone conversations are a particular case of human-human interaction whose automatic processing raises problems, especially due to the speech recognition step required to obtain the transcription of the speech contents.",
        "First, the speaker's behavior may be unexpected and the training/test mismatch may be very large.",
        "Second, the speech signal may be strongly impacted by various sources of variability: environment and channel noises, acquisition devices, etc.",
        "Telephone conversation issues Topics are related to the reason why the customer called.",
        "Various classes corresponding to the main customer's requests are considered (lost and founds, traffic state, timelines, etc).",
        "In addition to classical issues in such adverse conditions, the topic-identification system should deal with problems related to class proximity.",
        "For example, a lost & found request is related to itinerary (where was the object lost?)",
        "or timeline (when?",
        "), that could appear in most of the classes.",
        "In fact, these conversations involve a relatively small set of basic concepts related to transportation issues.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of a dialogue which is manually labeled by the agent as an issue related to an infraction.",
        "However, words in bold suggest that this conversation could be related to a transportation card.",
        "Thus, we assume that a dialogue representation should be seen as a multi-view problem to substantiate the claims regarding the multi-theme representation of a given dialogue.",
        "On the other hand, multi-view approaches introduce additional variability due to the diversity of the views.",
        "This variability is also due to the vocabulary used by both agent and customer 443 Agent: Hello Customer: Hello Agent: Speaking ...",
        "Customer: I call you because I was fined today, but I still have an imagine card suitable for zone 1 [...] I forgot to use my navigo card for zone 2 Agent: You did not use your navigo card, that is why they give you a fine not for a zone issue [...] Customer: Thanks, bye Agent: bye Agent Customer Transportation cards Figure 1: Example of a dialogue from the DECODA corpus labeled by the agent as an infraction issue which contains more than one theme (infrac- tion + transportation cards).",
        "during a telephone conversation.",
        "Indeed, an agent have to follow an predefined scenario of conversation.",
        "Thus, the agent can find the main reason for the call which corresponds to the theme.",
        "Proposed solutions An efficient way to tackle both ASR robustness and class ambiguity could be to map dialogues into a topic space abstracting the ASR outputs.",
        "Then, dialogue categorization is achieved in this topic space.",
        "Numerous unsupervised methods for topic-space estimation were proposed in the past.",
        "Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) has been largely used for speech analytics; one of its main drawbacks is the tuning of the model, that involves various meta-parameters such as the number of classes (that determines the model granularity), word distribution meth-ods, temporal spans.",
        ".",
        ".",
        "If the decision process is highly dependent on these features, the system's performance could be quite unstable.",
        "Classically, this abstract representation involves selecting the right number of classes composing the topic space.",
        "This decision is crucial since topic model perplexity, which expresses its qual-ity, is highly dependent on this feature.",
        "Further-more, the multi-theme context of the study (see Figure 1) involves a more complex dialogue representation.",
        "In this paper, we propose to deal with these two drawbacks by using a compact representation from multiple topic spaces.",
        "This model is based on a robust multi-view representation of the textual documents.",
        "A multi-view representation of a dialogue introduces both a relevant variability needed to represent different contexts of the dialogue, and a noisy variability related to topic space processing.",
        "Thus, a topic-based representation of a dialogue is built from the dialogue content itself.",
        "For this reason, the mapping process of a dialogue into several topic spaces generates a noisy variability related to the difference between the dialogue and the content of each class.",
        "In the same way, the relevant variability comes from the common content between the dialogue and the classes composing the topic space.",
        "We propose to reduce the noisy variability by using a factor analysis technique, which was initially developed in the domain of speaker identification.",
        "In this field, the factor analysis paradigm is used as a decomposition model that enables to separate the representation space into two subspaces containing respectively useful and useless information.",
        "The general Joint Factor Analysis (JFA) paradigm (Kenny et al., 2008) considers multiple variabilities that may be cross-dependent.",
        "Therefore, JFA representation allows us to compensate the variability within sessions of a same speaker.",
        "This representation is an extension of the GMM-UBM (Gaussian Mixture Model-Universal Background Model) models (Reynolds and Rose, 1995).",
        "(Dehak et al., 2011) extract a compact super-vector (called an i-vector) from the GMM super-vector.",
        "The aim of the compression process (i-vector extraction) is to represent the super-vector variability in a low dimensional space.",
        "Although this compact representation is widely used in speaker recognition systems, this method has not been used yet in the field of text classification.",
        "In this paper, we propose to apply factor analysis to compensate noisy variabilities due to the multiplication of LDA models.",
        "Furthermore, a normalization approach to condition dialogue representations (multi-model and i-vector) is presented.",
        "The two methods showed improvements for speaker verification: within Class Covariance Normalization (WCCN) (Dehak et al., 2011) and Eigen Factor Radial (EFR) (Bousquet et al., 2011).",
        "The latter includes length normalization (Garcia- Romero and Espy-Wilson, 2011).",
        "Both methods dilate the total variability space as a means of reducing the within-class variability.",
        "In our multi-model representation, the within class variability is redefined according to both dialogue content 444 (vocabulary) and topic space characteristics (word distributions among the topics).",
        "Thus, the speaker is represented by a theme, and the speaker session is a set of topic-based representations (frames) of a dialogue (session).",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents previous related works.",
        "The dialogue representation is described in Section 3.",
        "Section 4 introduces the i-vector compact representation and presents its application to text documents.",
        "Sections 5 and 6 report experiments and results.",
        "The last section concludes and proposes some perspectives.",
        "2 Related work In the past, several approaches considered a text document as a mixture of latent topics.",
        "These methods, such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al., 1990; Bellegarda, 1997), Probabilistic LSA (PLSA) (Hofmann, 1999) or Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), build a higher-level representation of the document in a topic space.",
        "?",
        "Document is then considered as a bag-of-words (Salton, 1989) where the word order is not taken into account.",
        "These methods have demonstrated their performance on various tasks, such as sentence (Belle- garda, 2000) or keyword (Suzuki et al., 1998) extraction.",
        "In opposition to a multinomial mixture model, LDA considers that a theme is associated to each occurrence of a word composing the document, rather than associate a topic to the complete document.",
        "Therefore, a document can change topics from a word to another one.",
        "However, word occurrences are connected by a latent variable which controls the global match of the distribution of the topics in the document.",
        "These latent topics are characterized by a distribution of associated word probabilities.",
        "PLSA and LDA models have been shown to generally outperform LSA on IR tasks (Hofmann, 2001).",
        "Moreover, LDA provides a direct estimate of the relevance of a topic given a word set.",
        "In this paper, probabilities of hidden topic features, estimated with LDA, are considered for possibly capturing word dependencies expressing the semantic contents of a given conversation.",
        "Topic-based approaches involve defining a number of topics composing the topic space.",
        "The choice of the ?right?",
        "number of topics is a crucial step, especially when the documents may contain multiple themes.",
        "Many studies have tried to find a relevant method to deal with this issue.",
        "(Arun et al., 2010) proposed to use a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to represent the separability between the words contained in the vocabulary.",
        "Then, if the singular values of the topic-word matrix M equal the norm of the rows of M, this means that the vocabulary is well separated among the topics.",
        "This method has to be evaluated with the Kullback-Liebler divergence metric for each topic space.",
        "However, this process would be time consuming for thousands of representations of a dialogue.",
        "(Teh et al., 2004) proposed the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) method to find the ?right?",
        "number of topics by assuming that the data has a hierarchical structure.",
        "The HDP models were then compared to the LDA ones on the same dataset.",
        "(Zavitsanos et al., 2008) presented a method to learn the right depth of an ontology depending of the number of topics of LDA models.",
        "The study presented by (Cao et al., 2009) is quite similar to (Teh et al., 2004).",
        "The authors consider the average correlation between pairs of topics at each stage as the right number of topics.",
        "All these methods assume that a document can have only one representation since they consider that finding the optimal topic model is the best solution.",
        "Another solution would be to consider a set of topic models to represent a document.",
        "Nonethe-less, a multi-topic-based representation of a dialogue can involve a noisy variability due to the mapping of a dialogue in each topic space.",
        "Indeed, a dialogue does not share its content (i.e. words) with each class composing the topic space.",
        "Thus, a variability is added during the mapping process.",
        "Another weakness of the multi-view representation is the relation between classes in a topic space.",
        "(Blei and Lafferty, 2006) show that classes into a LDA topic space are correlated.",
        "More-over, (Li and McCallum, 2006) consider a class as a node of an acyclic graph and as a distribution over other classes contained in the same topic space.",
        "3 Multi-view representation of automatic dialogue transcriptions in a homogeneous space The purpose of the considered application is the identification of the major theme of a human-human telephone conversation in the customer 445 care service (CCS) of the RATP Paris transportation system.",
        "The approach considered in this paper focuses on modeling the variability between different dialogues expressing the same theme t. For this purpose, it is important to select relevant features that represent semantic contents for the theme of a dialogue.",
        "An attractive set of features for capturing possible semantically relevant word dependencies is obtained with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), as described in section 2.",
        "Given a training set of conversations D, a hidden topic space is derived and a conversation d is represented by its probability in each topic of the hidden space.",
        "Estimation of these probabilities is affected by a variability inherent to the estimation of the model parameters.",
        "If many hidden spaces are considered and features are computed for each hidden space, it is possible to model the estimation variability together with the variability of the linguistic expression of a theme by different speakers in different real-life situations.",
        "Even if the purpose of the application is theme identification and a training corpus annotated with themes is available, supervised LDA (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004) is not suitable for the proposed approach.",
        "LDA is used only for producing different feature sets used involved in statistical variability models.",
        "In order to estimate the parameters of different hidden spaces, a set of discriminative words V is constructed as described in (Morchid et al., 2014a).",
        "Each theme t contains a set of specific words.",
        "Note that the same word may appear in several discriminative word sets.",
        "All the selected words are then merged without repetition to form V .",
        "Several techniques, such as Variational Methods (Blei et al., 2003), Expectation-propagation (Minka and Lafferty, 2002) or Gibbs Sampling (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004), have been proposed for estimating the parameters describing a LDA hidden space.",
