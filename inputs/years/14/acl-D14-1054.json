        "JSC automatically conducts sentence segmentation by considering the sentiment polarity of sen-tence, and utilize the phrasal information from the segmentations.",
        "Ideally, JSC regards phrases like ?not bad?",

        "From Figure 2, we find that the joint model consistently outperforms pipelined baseline methods in all feature settings.",
        "The reason is that the pipelined methods suffer from error propaga-tion, since the errors from linguistic-driven and bag-of-word segmentations cannot be corrected by the sentiment classification model.",
        "Besides, traditional segmentors do not update the segmentation model with the sentiment information of text. Unlike pipelined methods, the joint model is capable to address these problems by optimizing the segmentation model with the classification results in a joint framework, which yields better performance on sentiment classification.",
        "We also find that Pipeline 2 always outperforms Pipeline 1, which indicates the usefulness of phrase-based segmentation for sentiment classification.",
        "6.5 Effect of the beam size N We investigate the influence of beam size N , which is the maximum number of segmentation candidates of a sentence.",
        "In this part, we clamp the feature set as [PF+SF, PF+CF], and vary the beam size N in [1,2,4,8,16,32,64].",
        "The experiment results of macro-F1 on the development set are illustrated in Figure 3 (a).",
        "The time cost of each training iteration is given in Figure 3 (b).",
        "From Figure 3 (a), we can see that when larger beam size is considered, the classification performance is improved.",
        "When beam size is 1, the model stands for the greedy search with the bag-of-words segmentation.",
        "When the beam size is s-mall, such as 2, beam search losses many phrasal information of sentences and thus the improvement is not significant.",
        "The performance remains steady when beam size is larger than 16.",

        "Figure 3 (b), we can find that the runtime of each training iteration increases with larger beam size.",
        "It is intuitive as the joint model with larger beam considers more segmentation results, which increases the training time of the segmentation model.",
        "We set beam size as 16 after parameter learning.",
        "6.6 Effect of the top-ranked segmentation number K We investigate how the top-ranked segmentation number K affects the performance of sentiment classification.",
        "In this part, we set the feature as [PF+SF, PF+CF], and the beam size as 16.",
        "The results of macro-F1 on the development set are illustrated in Figure 4.",

        "The reason is that when a larger K is used, (1) at training time, the sentiment classifier is built by using more phrasal information from multiple segmen-tations, which benefits from the ensembles; (2) at test time, the joint model considers several top-ranked segmentations and get the final sentiment polarity through voting.",
        "The performance remains stable when K is larger than 7, as the phrasal information has been mostly covered.",
        "7 Conclusion In this paper, we develop a joint segmentation and classification framework (JSC) for sentiment analysis.",
        "Unlike existing sentiment classification algorithms that build sentiment classifier based on the segmentation results from bag-of-words or separate segmentors, the proposed joint model simultaneously conducts sentence segmentation and sentiment classification.",
        "We introduce a marginal log-likelihood function to optimize the segmentation model, and effectively train the joint model from sentences annotated only with sentiment polarity, without segmentation annotations of sentences.",
        "The effectiveness of the joint model has been verified by applying it on the benchmark dataset of Twitter sentiment classification in SemEval 2013.",
        "Results show that, the joint model performs comparably with state-of-the-art meth-ods, and outperforms pipelined methods in various settings.",
        "In the future, we plan to apply the joint model on other domains, such as movie/product reviews.",
