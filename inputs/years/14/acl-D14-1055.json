        "The Web has dramatically changed the way people express themselves and interact with others, people frequently write reviews on e-commerce sites, forums and blogs to achieve these purposes.",
        "For NLP (Natural Language Processing), these user-generated contents are of great value in that they contain abundant information related to peo-ple's opinions on certain topics.",
        "Currently, online reviews on products and services are used extensively by consumers and businesses to conduct decisive purchase, product design and marketing strategies.",
        "Hence, sentiment analysis and opinion mining based on product reviews have become a popular topic of NLP (Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu, 2012).",
        "However, since reviews information can guide people's purchase behavior, positive reviews can result in huge economic benefits and fame for organizations or individuals.",
        "This leaves room for promoting the generation of review spams.",
        "Through observations and studies of the predecessors (Jindal and Liu, 2008; Ott et al., 2011), review spams are divided into the following two classes: ?",
        "Deceptive Reviews: Those deliberately mislead readers by giving undeserving positive reviews to some target objects in order to promote the objects, or by giving unjust negative reviews to some target objects in order to damage their reputation.",
        "?",
        "Disruptive Reviews: Those are non-reviews, which mainly include advertisements and other irrelevant reviews containing no opinion.",
        "Disruptive reviews pose little threat to peo-ple, because human can easily identify and ignore them.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the more challenging ones: deceptive reviews.",
        "Generally, deceptive reviews detection is deemed to be a classification problem (Ott et al., 2011; Li et al., 2011; Feng et al., 2012).",
        "Based on the positive and negative examples annotated by people, supervised learning is utilized to build a classifier, and then an unlabeled review can be predicted as deceptive review or truthful one.",
        "But the work from Ott et al. (2011) shows that human cannot identify deceptive reviews from their prior knowledge, which indicates that human-annotated review datasets must 488 include some mislabeled examples.",
        "These examples will disturb the generation ability of the classifiers.",
        "So simple supervised learning is regarded as unsuitable for this task.",
        "It is difficult to come by human labeling needed for supervised learning and evaluation, we cannot obtain the datasets containing deceptive reviews.",
        "However, we can get some truthful reviews with high confidence by heuristic rules and prior knowledge.",
        "Meanwhile, a lot of unlabeled reviews are available.",
        "The problem thus is this: based on some truthful reviews and a lot of unlabeled re-views, can we build an accurate classifier to identify deceptive reviews.",
        "PU (positive unlabeled) learning can be utilized to deal with the above situation (Liu et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2003).",
        "Different from traditional supervised learning, PU learning can still build an accurate classifier even without the negative training examples.",
        "Several PU learning techniques have been applied successfully in document classification with promising results (Zhang, 2005; Elkan and Noto, 2008; Li et al., 2009; Xiao et al., 2011), while they have yet to be applied in detecting deceptive reviews.",
        "Here, we will study how to design PU learning to detect deceptive reviews.",
        "An important challenge is how to deal with spy examples (easily mislabeled) of unlabeled re-views, which is not easily handled by the previous PU learning techniques.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel approach, mixing population and individual property PU learning (MPIPUL), by assigning similarity weights and incorporating weights into SVM learning phase.",

        "2 Related Work 2.1 Deceptive Reviews Detection Spam has historically been investigated in the contexts of e-mail (Drucker et al., 1999; Gyongyi et al., 2004) and the Web (Ntoulas et al., 2006).",
        "In recent years, researchers have started to look at deceptive reviews.",
        "Jindal and Liu (2008) found that opinion spam was widespread and different from e-mail and Web spam in essence (Jindal and Liu, 2008).",
        "They trained models using product review data, by defining features to distinguish duplicate opinion and non-duplicate based on the review tex-t, reviewers and product information.",
        "Wu et al. (2010) proposed an alternative strategy of popularity rankings (Wu et al., 2010).",
        "Ott et al. (2011) developed the first dataset containing gold-standard deceptive reviews by crowd-sourcing (Ott et al., 2011), and presented three supervised learning methods to detect deceptive reviews by integrating knowledge from psycholinguistics and computational linguistics.",
        "This gold-standard dataset will be used in the paper.",
        "Li et al. (2011) manually built a review dataset from their crawled reviews (Li et al., 2011), and exploited semi-supervised co-training algorithm to identify deceptive reviews.",
        "Feng et al. (2012) verified the connection between the deceptive reviews and the abnormal distributions (Feng et al., 2012a).",
        "Later, they (Feng et al., 2012b) demonstrated that features driven from CFG (Context Free Grammar) parsing trees consistently improve the detection performance.",
        "Mukherjee et al. (2012) proposed detecting group spammers (a group of reviewers who work collaboratively to write deceptive reviews) in product reviews (Mukherjee et al., 2012).",
        "The proposed method first used frequent itemset mining to find a set of candidate groups.",
        "Then GSRank was presented which can consider relationships among groups, individual reviewers and products they reviewed to detect spammer groups.",
        "Later, they also proposed exploiting observed reviewing behaviors to detect opinion spammers in an unsupervised Bayesian inference framework (Mukher- jee et al., 2013).",
        "Ren et al. (2014) assumed that there must be some difference on language structure and sentiment polarity between deceptive reviews and truthful ones (Ren et al., 2014a), then they defined the features related to the review text and used genetic algorithm for feature selection, finally they combined two unsupervised clustering algorithm to identify deceptive reviews.",
        "Later, they (Ren et al., 2014b) present a new approach, from the viewpoint of correcting the mislabeled 489 examples, to find deceptive reviews.",
        "Firstly, they partition a dataset into several subsets.Then they construct a classifier set for each subset and select the best one to evaluate the whole dataset.",
        "Meanwhile, error variables are defined to compute the probability that the examples have been mis-labeled.",
        "Finally, the mislabeled examples are corrected based on two threshold schemes, majority and non-objection.",
        "Unlike previous studies, PU learning is implemented to identify deceptive reviews.",
        "2.2 Positive Unlabeled Learning According to the use of the unlabeled data, PU learning can be divided into two classes.",
        "One family of methods built the final classifier by using positive examples dataset and some examples of the unlabeled dataset (Liu et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2003).",
        "The basic idea is to find a set of reliable negative examples from the unlabeled data firstly, and then to learn a classifier using EM (Expectation Maximization) or SVM.",
        "The performance is limited for neglecting the rest examples of unlabeled dataset.",
        "Another family of methods learned the final classifier by using positive examples dataset and all examples of the unlabeled dataset.",
        "Li et al. (Li et al., 2009) studied PU learning in the data stream environment, they proposed a PU learning LELC (PU Learning by Extracting Likely positive and negative micro-Clusters) for document classification, they assume that the examples close together shared the same labels.",
        "Xiao et al. (Xiao et al., 2011) proposed a method, called SPUL (similarity-based PU learning), the local similarity-based and global similarity-based mechanisms are proposed to generate the similarity weights for the easily mislabeled examples, respectively.",
        "Experimental results show global SPUL generally performs better than local SPUL.",
        "In this paper, a novel PU learning (MPIPUL) is proposed to identify deceptive reviews.",

        "So high-quality negative examples must be guaranteed.",
        "Previous works solved the problem with the Spy technique (Liu et al., 2002) or the Rocchio technique (Liu et al., 2003), we integrate them in order to get reliable negative examples.",

        "In order to utilize spy examples in subset US, some representative positive and negative examples are calculated firstly.",

        "Therefore, during one round of the algorithm, the training set contains 720 examples including 72 positive examples (set P ) and 648 unlabeled examples (set U ), and the test set contains 80 examples including 40 positive and 40 negative ones.",
