        "The ability to learn a translation lexicon or even build a machine translation system using monolingual data helps address the problems of insufficient parallel data.",

        "4.2 Data Table 2 shows the data available to us in our experiments.",
        "The majority of parallel text comes from Global Voices 1 (GV).",
        "The website contains international news translated into different foreign languages.",
        "Besides that, we also have a very small amount of parallel text containing local web news, with English translations provided by native speakers at the University of Texas, Austin.",
        "The Malagasy side of this small parallel corpus also has syntactical annotation, which is used to train a very basic Malagasy part of speech tagger and dependency parser.",
        "We also have much larger amounts of non parallel data for both languages.",
        "For Malagasy, we spent two months manually collecting 15.3 million tokens of news text from local news websites in Madagascar.",
        "2 We have released this data for future research use.",
        "For English, we have 2.4 billion tokens from the Gigaword corpus.",
        "Since the Malagasy monolingual data is collected from local websites, it is reasonable to argue that those data contain significant amount of information related to Africa.",
        "Therefore, we also collect 396 million tokens of African news in English from allAfrica.com.",
        "4.3 Building A Dependency Parser for Malagasy Since Malagasy and English have very different word orders, we decide to apply dependency based decipherment for the two languages as suggested by Dou and Knight (2013).",
        "To extract dependency relations, we need to parse monolingual data in Malagasy and English.",
        "For English, there are already many good parsers available.",
        "In our experiments, we use Turbo parser (Martins et al., 2013) trained on the English Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) to parse all our English monolingual data.",
        "However, there is no existing good parser for Malagasy.",
        "The quality of a dependency parser depends on the amount of training data available.",
        "State-of-the-art English parsers are built from Penn Treebank, which contains over 1 million tokens of annotated syntactical 1 globalvoicesonline.org 2 aoraha.com, gazetiko.com, inovaovao.com, expressmada.com, lakroa.com 561 Figure 3: Learning curve showing our joint word alignment and decipherment approach improves word alignment quality over the traditional EM without decipherment (Model 1: Iteration 1 to 10, HMM: Iteration 11 to 15) trees.",
        "In contrast, the available data for training a Malagasy parser is rather limited, with only 168 sentences, and 2.8k tokens, as shown in Table 2.",
        "At the very be-ginning, we use the last 120 sentences as training data to train a part of speech (POS) tagger using a toolkit provided by Garrette et al. (2013) and a dependency parser with the Turbo parser.",
        "We test the performance of the parser on the first 48 sentences and obtain 72.4% accuracy.",
        "One obvious way to improve tagging and parsing accuracy is to get more annotated data.",
        "We find more data with only part of speech tags containing 465 sentences and 10k tokens released by (Garrette et al., 2013), and add this data as extra training data for POS tagger.",
        "Also, we download an online dictionary that contains POS tags for over 60k Malagasy word types from mala-gasyword.org.",
        "The dictionary is very helpful for tagging words never seen in the training data.",
        "It is natural to think that creation of annotated data for training a POS tagger and a parser requires large amounts of efforts from annotators who understand the language well.",
        "However, we find that through the help of parallel data and dictionaries, we are able to create more annotated data by ourselves to improve tagging and parsing accuracy.",
        "This idea is inspired by previous work that tries to learn a semi-supervised parser by projecting dependency relations from one language (with good dependency parsers) to another (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001; Ganchev et al., 2009).",
        "However, we find those automatic approaches do not work well for Malagasy.",
        "To further expand our Malagasy training data, we first use a POS tagger and parser with poor performance to parse 788 sentences (20k tokens) on the Malagasy side of the parallel corpus from Global Voices.",
        "Then, we correct both the dependency links and POS tags based on information from dictionaries 3 and the English translation of the parsed sentence.",
        "We spent 3 months to manually project English dependencies to Malagasy and eventually improve test set parsing accuracy from 72.4% to 80.0%.",
        "We also make this data available for future research use.",
        "4.4 Machine Translation Experiments In this section, we present the data used for our MT experiments, and compare three different systems to justify our joint word alignment and decipherment approach.",
        "4.4.1 Baseline Machine Translation System We build a state-of-the-art phrase-based MT system, PBMT, using Moses (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "PBMT has 3 models: a translation model, a distortion model, and a language model.",
        "We train the other models using half of the Global Voices parallel data (the rest is reserved for development and testing), and build a 5- gram language model using 834 million tokens from AFP section of English Gigaword, 396 million tokens from allAfrica, and the English part of the parallel corpus for training.",
        "For alignment, we run 10 iterations of Model 1, and 5 iterations of HMM.",
        "We did not run Model 3 and Model 4 as we see no improvements in Bleu scores from running those models.",
        "We do word 3 an online dictionary from malagasyword.org, as well as a lexicon learned from the parallel data 562 alignment in two directions and use grow-diag-final- and heuristic to obtain final alignment.",
        "During decod-ing, we use 8 standard features in Moses to score a candidate translation: direct and inverse translation proba-bilities, direct and inverse lexical weighting, a language model score, a distortion score, phrase penalty, and word penalty.",
        "The weights for the features are learned on the tuning data using minimum error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003).",
        "To compare with previous decipherment approach to improve machine translation, we build a second baseline system.",
        "We follow the work by Dou and Knight (2013) to decipher Malagasy into English, and build a translation lexicon T decipher from decipherment.",
        "To improve machine translation, we simply use T decipher as an additional parallel corpus.",
        "First, we filter T decipher by keeping only translation pairs ( f , e), where f is observed in the Spanish part and e is observed in the English part of the parallel corpus.",
        "Then we append all the Spanish and English words in the filtered T decipher to the end of Spanish part and English part of the parallel corpus respectively.",
        "The training and tuning process is the same as the baseline machine translation system PBMT.",
        "We call this system Decipher-Pipeline.",
        "4.4.2 Joint Word Alignment and Decipherment for Machine Translation When deciphering Malagasy to English, we extract Malagasy dependency bigrams using all available Malagasy monolingual data plus the Malagasy part of the Global Voices parallel data, and extract English dependency bigrams using 834 million tokens from English Gigaword, and 396 million tokens from allAfrica news to build an English dependency language model.",
        "In the other direction, we extract English dependency bigrams from English part of the entire parallel corpus plus 9.7 million tokens from allAfrica news 4 , and use 17.3 million tokens Malagasy monolingual data (15.3 million from the web and 2.0 million from Global Voices) to build a Malagasy dependency language model.",
        "We require that all dependency bigrams only contain words observed in the parallel data used to train the baseline MT system.",
        "During learning, we run Model 1 without decipherment for 5 iterations.",
        "Then we perform joint word alignment and decipherment for another 5 iterations with Model 1 and 5 iterations with HMM.",
        "We tune decipherment weights (?)",
        "for Model 1 and HMM using grid search against Bleu score on a development set.",
        "In the end, we only extract rules from one direction P(English|Malagasy), where the decipherment weights for Model 1 and HMM are 0.5 and 0.005 respectively.",
        "We chose this because we did not find any benefits to tune the weights on each direction, and then use grow-diag-final-end heuristic to form final alignments.",
        "We call this system Decipher-Joint.",
        "4 We do not find further Bleu gains by using more English monolingual data.",
        "Parallel Malagasy English Train (GV) 0.9 million 0.8 million Tune (GV) 22.2k 20.2k Test (GV) 23k 21k Test (Web) 2.2k 2.1k Non Parallel Malagasy English Gigaword N/A 834 million Web 15.3 million 396 million Table 3: Size of training, tuning, and testing data in number of tokens (GV: Global Voices) 4.5 Results We tune each system three times with MERT and choose the best weights based on Bleu scores on tuning set.",
        "Table 4 shows that while using a translation lexicon learnt from decipherment does not improve the quality of machine translation significantly, the joint approach improves Bleu score by 0.9 and 2.1 on Global Voices test set and web news test set respectively.",
        "The results show that the parsing quality correlates with gains in Bleu scores.",
        "Scores in the brackets in the last row of the table are achieved using a dependency parser with 72.4% attachment accuracy, while scores outside the brackets are obtained using a dependency parser with 80.0% attachment accuracy.",
        "We analyze the results and find the gain mainly comes from two parts.",
        "First, adding expected counts from non parallel data makes the distribution of translation probabilities sparser in word alignment models.",
        "The probabilities of translation pairs favored by both parallel data and decipherment becomes higher.",
        "This gain is consistent with previous observation where a sparse prior is applied to EM to help improve word alignment and machine translation (Vaswani et al., 2012).",
        "Second, expected counts from decipherment also help discover new translation pairs in the parallel data for low frequency words, where those words are either aligned to NULL or wrong translations in the baseline.",
        "5 Conclusion and Future Work We propose a new objective function for word alignment to combine the process of word alignment and decipherment into a single task.",
        "In, experiments, we find that the joint process performs better than previous pipeline approach, and observe Bleu gains of 0.9 and 2.1 point on Global Voices and local web news test sets, respectively.",
        "Finally, our research leads to the release of 15.3 million tokens of monolingual Malagasy data from the web as well as a small Malagasy dependency tree bank containing 20k tokens.",
        "Given the positive results we obtain by using the joint approach to improve word alignment, we are in-563 Decipherment System Tune (GV) Test (GV) Test (Web) None PBMT (Baseline) 18.5 17.1 7.7 Separate Decipher-Pipeline 18.5 17.4 7.7 Joint Decipher-Joint 18.9 (18.7) 18.0 (17.7) 9.8 (8.5) Table 4: Decipher-Pipeline does not show significant improvement over the baseline system.",
        "In contrast, Decipher-Joint using joint word alignment and decipherment approach achieves a Bleu gain of 0.9 and 2.1 on the Global Voices test set and the web news test set, respectively.",
        "The results in brackets are obtained using a parser trained with only 120 sentences.",
