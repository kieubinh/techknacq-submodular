        "Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) is a special case of information retrieval (IR) in which documents and queries are presented in different languages.",
        "In order to overcome the language barrier, the most commonly adopted method is to translate queries into the document language.",
        "Many methods have been introduced for translating queries for CLIR, ranging from word-by-word dictionary lookups (Xu and Weischedel, 2005; Darwish and Oard, 2003) to sophisticated use of machine translation (MT) systems (Magdy and Jones, 2011; Ma et al., 2012).",
        "Previous research has shown that combining evidence from different translation approaches is superior to any single query translation method (Braschler, 2004; Herbert et al., 2011).",
        "While there are numerous combination-of-evidence techniques for both mono-lingual and cross-lingual IR, recent work suggests that there is no one-size-fits-all solution.",
        "In fact, the optimal combination weights (i.e., weights assigned to each piece of evidence in a linear combination) differ greatly across queries, tasks, languages, and other variants (Ture et al., 2012; Berger and Savoy, 2007).",
        "In this paper, we introduce a novel method for learning optimal combination weights when building a linear combination of existing query translation approaches.",
        "From standard query-document relevance judgments we train a set of classifiers, which produce a unique combination recipe for each query, based on a large set of features extracted from the query and collection.",
        "Experimental results show that the effectiveness of our method is significantly higher than state-of-the-art query translation methods and other combination strategies.",
        "2 Related Work The earliest approaches to query translation for CLIR used machine-readable bilingual dictionaries (Hull and Grefenstette, 1996; Balles-teros and Croft, 1996), achieving around up to 60% of monolingual IR effectiveness.",
        "Xu and Weischedel (2005) showed that effectiveness can be increased to around 80% by weighting each translation proportional to its rank in the dictionary.",
        "The practice of weighting translation candidates was later formulated as a ?structured query?, in which each query term is represented by a probability distribution over its translations in the document language (Pirkola, 1998; Kwok, 1999; Darwish and Oard, 2003).",
        "Our approach is based on the structured query formulation.",
        "Some of the earliest studies in IR discovered that with different underlying models, the retrieved document set would vary substantially, al-589 though the effectiveness was similar (McGill et al., 1979).",
        "Later studies showed that combining different representations of the query and/or document often produced superior output (Rajashekar and Croft, 1995; Turtle and Croft, 1990; Fox, 1983).",
        "This intuitive idea was supported theoretically by Pearl (1988), concluding that multiple pieces of evidence estimates relevance more accu-rately, but that the benefit strongly depends on the quality and independence of each piece.",
        "Experiments by Belkin et al. (1995) indicated the need to properly weight each representation with respect to its effectiveness.",
        "These so-called ?combination- of-evidence?",
        "techniques became more powerful with the introduction of Indri, a probabilistic retrieval framework specifically designed for combining multiple query and document representations (Metzler and Croft, 2005).",
        "Croft (2000) provides a detailed summary of earlier query combination approaches in IR, while Peters et al. (2012) cites more recent related work.",
        "The benefits of combination-of-evidence transfer to the cross-lingual case especially well, since the inherent ambiguity of translation readily provides a diverse set of representations.",
        "Most CLIR approaches implement a post-retrieval merging of ranked lists, each generated from different query (Hiemstra et al., 2001; Savoy, 2001; Gey et al., 2001; Chen and Gey, 2004) or document (Lopez and Romary, 2009) representations, also called ?data fusion?.",
        "In contrast, we focus on a pre-retrieval combination at the modeling stage, so that a single complex query is used in retrieval, instead of multiple simpler ones.",
        "Two advantages of the former are easier implementation (since the approach requires no changes to the modeling side) and the possibly greater diversity that can be achieved by having separate retrieval runs.",
        "How-ever, each ranked list needs to be limited in size, which might cause some potentially useful documents not to be considered in the combination at all.",
        "Since the focus of this paper is on the modeling end of retrieval, pre-retrieval combination was a more suitable choice, though we think that the two approaches have complementary benefits.",
        "The idea of combining query translations before retrieval has been explored previously.",
        "Braschler (2004) combines three translation ap-proaches: output of an MT system, a novel translation approach based on a similarity thesaurus built automatically from a comparable corpus, and a dictionary-based translation.",
        "The main reason that this combination does not provide much benefit is due to the lower coverage of the thesaurus-based and dictionary-based translation methods.",
        "A similar approach by Herbert et al. (2011) uses Wikipedia to provide translations of certain phrases and entities, and combining that with the Google Translate MT system yields statistically significant improvements in English-to-German retrieval.",
        "More recently, Ture et al. (2012) presented a more sophisticated translation approach using the internal representation of an MT system, and reported statistically significant improvements when a pre-retrieval combination was performed.",
        "All of the previously cited approaches either use uniform weights for combination, or select weights based on collection-level information.",
        "However, as stated previously, numerous studies suggest that certain methods work better on certain queries, collections, languages.",
        "In fact, when weights are optimized separately on each collection, they differ substantially across different collections (Ture et al., 2012).",
        "For monolingual retrieval, there has been a series of learning-to-rank (LTR) papers that determine weights for query concepts (Bendersky et al., 2011), such that retrieval effectiveness is maximized.",
        "A recent study extends this idea to the cross-lingual case, by learning how to weight each translated word for English-Persian CLIR (Azarbonyad et al., 2013).",
        "In contrast, we extract translated word weights from diverse and sophisticated translation methods, then learn how to weight each translated structured query, We call this ?learning-to- translate?",
        "(LTT), which can be formulated as a simpler learning problem.",
        "In CLIR, both LTR and LTT are under-explored problems, with a common goal of applying machine learning techniques to improve query translation, yet with complementary benefits.",
        "To our knowledge, there has been one prior LTT approach: a classifier was trained to predict effectiveness of each query translation, using features based on statistics of the query terms (Berger and Savoy, 2007).",
        "Instead of weighting, the translations with highest classifier scores were concatenated, yielding statistically significant improvements over using the single-best translation method.",
        "However, the translation methods explored in this paper are all based on one-best MT 590 systems, making it difficult to draw strong conclusions.",
        "3 Query Translation The primary contribution of this paper is to show how a diverse set of query translation (QT) methods can be combined effectively into a single weighted structured query, with improved retrieval effectiveness.",
        "While our approach can applied to any set of translation methods, we focus on three methods that have complementary strengths and that have shown promise in CLIR: word-based probabilistic translation, one-best MT, and n-best probabilistic MT.",
        "We briefly present our implementation of each method; more details can be found in earlier work (Darwish and Oard, 2003; Ture et al., 2012).",
        "Each QT method generates a representation of the query in the document language.",
        "In the case of word-based and n-best MT approaches, the representation is a structured query itself, where each query word is represented by a probability distribution over translation alternatives.",
        "For one-best MT, the query is represented by a bag of translated words.",
        "3.1 One-Best MT A query translation approach that has become more popular recently is to simply run the query through an MT system, and use the best output as the query: t 1 t 2 .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "t l = MT(s 1 s 2 .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "s k ) (1) where s = s 1 s 2 .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "s k is the query and t = t 1 t 2 .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "t l is the translated query.",
        "Since modern statistical MT systems generate high-quality translations for many language pairs, this one-best strategy works reasonably well for retrieval and provides a competitive baseline.",
        "A practical advantage of this approach is the ease of implementation ?",
        "one can simply use any MT interface (e.g., Google Translate) as a black box in their CLIR system.",
        "3.2 Probabilistic n-best MT The top translation might sometimes be incorrect, or might lack some of the alternative representations that are very useful in retrieval.",
        "Therefore, considering the n highest scored translations (also referred to as the n-best list in MT literature) has become increasingly popular in CLIR approaches.",
        "In order to benefit from the diversity amongst the n-best translations, one can simply concatenate them together, forming a large list of query terms.",
        "However, statistical MT systems also assign probabilities to each translation, which can be incorporated into the query representation for better effectiveness, as suggested by Ture et al. (2012).",
        "In this approach, each of the top n translation candidates from the MT system are processed one by one.",
        "For each translation candidate, the MT system provides a translation probability, and alignments between words in the query and its translation.",
        "As we process each of the n transla-tions, for each query word s i , we accumulate probabilities on each translated word t ij aligned to s i .",
        "Finally, we normalize the translation probabilities to get Pr nbest (t ij |s i ).",
        "3.3 Word-based One of the most widely used approaches in CLIR is based on translating each query word s i in-dependently, with probabilities assigned to each translation candidate t ij .",
        "Translations are derived automatically from a bilingual corpus using statistical word alignment techniques, which are used as part of the training of statistical MT systems (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "These probabilities can be exploited for retrieval based on the technique of Darwish and Oard (2003) for ?projecting?",
        "text into the document language.",
        "After cleaning up the automatically learned translation probabilities (de- tails omitted for space considerations), we end up with the translation probabilities Pr word (t ij |s i ).",
        "4 Combination of Evidence Once we have multiple ways to represent the query q in the document language (QT i (q), i = 1 .",
        ".",
        ".m), it is possible to combine these ?pieces of evi-dence?",
        "into a single representation as follows: QT(q) = m ?",
        "i=1 w i (q)QT i (q) and each combination-of-evidence approach differs by how the combination weights w i are com-puted: Uniform In this baseline method, we ignore any information we have about the collection or query and assign equal weights to each method (i.e., w i (q) = 1/m).",
        "In our case, this means a weight 591 of 33.3% to each of the one-best, probabilistic n-best, and word-based QT methods.",
        "Task-specific We can optimize the combination weights by overall effectiveness on a specific retrieval task.",
        "Given a query set and collection, we perform a grid search on combination weights (with a step interval of 0.1) and select the weights that maximize retrieval effectiveness.",
        "The training is performed in a leave-one-out manner: weights for test query q are optimized on all queries except for q. Query-specific We propose a novel method to compute combination weights specifically for each query, resulting in a more customized optimization that can take into account how effectiveness of each translation method varies across queries.",
        "In the remainder of this section, we describe the details of our novel query-specific combination method.",
        "4.1 Overview of Query-Specific Combination We present a novel approach for determining query-specific combination weights by training a classifier for each QT method.",
        "Prior to training the classifier, we first run retrieval using each QT method, and evaluate the effectiveness of the retrieved documents.",
        "The effectiveness of the i th method on query q (i.e., f i (q)) is then converted into a binary label (further described in Section 4.2).",
        "Treating each query as a separate instance, a classifier is trained for each method, generating classifiers C 1 , .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", C m .",
        "During retrieval (i.e., at test time), for each query q, each trained classifier C i is applied to the query, resulting in a predicted label l i (q) and the classi-fier's confidence in a positive label, C i (q).",
        "1 These values are then used to determine combination weights w 1 (q), .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", w m (q) that are custom-fit for the query.",
        "4.2 Labeling First of all, we discard queries in which the difference between the best and worst performing methods is small (specifically, the worst performing method scores at least k 1 % of the best performing one).",
        "For such queries, generating fair training labels is more difficult and therefore more 1 The confidence in a negative label is 1?",
        "C i (q).",
        "likely to introduce noise into the process.",
        "2 More-over, these are exactly the queries where choosing optimal combination weights is less important (since all methods perform relatively similarly), so it is reasonable to exclude them from training.",
        "In fact, a high number of such queries would indicate lower potential for combination-of-evidence approaches.",
        "For each QT method i, we create training instances per query, per retrieval task.",
        "Since our goal is to select the best among existing methods, the training label should reflect the effectiveness of method i relative to other methods.",
        "A strategy that we call best-by-measure assigns a label of 1 if the effectiveness of the i th method (i.e., f i (q)) is at least k 2 % of the maximum effectiveness for that query, and 0 otherwise.",
        "While this directly correlates with retrieval effectiveness, labels might be distributed in an unbalanced manner, which might affect the training process negatively.",
        "A balanced labeling requires sorting all training instances by how much better the i th method is than other methods (max i ?",
        "6=i (f i ?",
        "(q)/f i (q))), and then assigning a label of 1 to the lower half and 0 to the higher half.",
        "This strategy is called best-by-rank.",
        "4.3 Features We introduce a diverse set of features, in order to train a robust classifier for predicting when each QT method performs better and worse than others.",
        "We split the feature set into four meaningful cate-gories, so that we can measure the impact of each subset separately: Surface features These features do not require a deep analysis of the query: (a) Number of words in query and the translated query, (b) Type of query that we automatically classify based on predefined templates (e.g., fact question, cause-effect, etc.",
        "), and (c) Number of stop words in the query and the translated query.",
        "Parse-based features These features are extracted from a deeper syntactic analysis of the query text: (a) Number of related names found in a named entity database, and (b) Existence of syntactic constituents in query and its translation (e.g., -- is there a VVB in the query parse tree?).",
        "2 We also experimented with including these queries with a third label (e.g., ?same?)",
        "and train a ternary classifier.",
        "Having more labels requires more training data, which is not easy to obtain for this task.",
        "Also, obtaining a balanced label distribution becomes even more difficult with three labels.",
        "592 Translation-based features These features consist of statistics computed from the query and its translation: (a) Number of query words that were unaligned in at least half of the n-best query translations, (b) Number of query words that were aligned to multiple target words in at least half of the n-best query translations, (c) Number of query words that were self-aligned (i.e., target word is exactly same string) in at least half of the n-best query translations, (d) Average / Standard deviation / Maximum / Minimum of entropy of Pr nbest of each query word, and (e) Average / Standard deviation / Maximum / Minimum of entropy of Pr word of each query word.",
        "Index-based features These features are based on frequency statistics from a representative col-lection: 3 (a) Average / Standard deviation / Maximum / Minimum of document frequency (df) of query words and their translations, (b) Average / Standard deviation / Maximum / Minimum of term frequency averaged across query words and their translations, and (c) Sum / Maximum / Minimum of total probability assigned to words that do not appear in the collection (df = 0).",
        "Additionally, the target language is a default feature in all of our experiments.",
        "For each classification task, we train a separate classifier on each subset of these four feature categories, so that there are 16 different sets (including the empty set).",
        "After we select which categories to pull features from, we optionally perform feature selection to reduce the number of features by a predefined percentage.",
        "In our experimentation, we observed that collection-based features were most useful for classifying the one-best method, whereas parse-based features were most discriminative for probabilistic 10-best.",
        "For the word-based QT method, the translation-based features were most effective in our experiments.",
        "We further analyze the effect of various features in Section 5.",
        "4.4 Training and Tuning Classifiers The scikit-learn package was used for the training pipeline (Pedregosa et al., 2012).",
        "Using an established toolkit allowed us to experiment with many options for classification, such as the learner type (support vector machine, maximum entropy, decision tree), feature set (16 subsets of 3 We used the BOLT collection in our experiments.",
        "the four categories described earlier) and two feature selection methods (recursive elimination or selection based on univariate statistical tests).",
        "In the end, we get 96 different parameter combinations while training a classifier for a particular QT method, resulting in the need for tuning ?",
        "picking the parameters that produce highest accuracy on a representative tuning set.",
        "Given that we have a set of queries for testing purposes, there are few strategies for selecting a training and tuning set.",
        "One approach is to apply a leave-one-out strategy, so that a classifier is trained and tuned on all but one of the test queries, and then applied on the remaining query to predict its label.",
        "We call this the fully-open setting.",
        "In a more realistic scenario, there will not be relevance judgments for the test queries, yet there might be a small amount of labeled data similar to the test task (e.g., different queries on same col-lection) that can be utilized for tuning purposes, and a larger set of training queries from different collections.",
        "We call this the half-blind setting.",
        "If testing in a new domain, queries of similar type are not available for training and tuning purposes.",
        "This is a more challenging scenario than the previous two, yet it is important for real-world applications.",
        "In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the training pipeline in this case, we hold out test queries entirely, then train and tune on queries from a completely different task (i.e., different queries and collection).",
        "We call this the fully-blind setting.",
        "4.5 Retrieval Once we have classifiers trained for all QT meth-ods, we can apply them to a given query on-the-fly, and compute query-specific combination weights.",
        "One approach is hard weighting, putting all weight onto a single method ?",
        "when there are more than one methods classified with label 1, we can either pick one randomly or use the classifier confidence value as a tie-breaker.",
        "An alternative is soft weighting, where the weight of the i th method can be computed either using classifier confidence C i (i.e., how confident the model is that the i th method will perform well), precision on tuning set precision i (i.e., how precise the model is at its pre-593 dictions for the i th method), or both: w s1 i (q) =C i (q) w s2 i (q) =precision i (1)?",

        "C i (q) +(1?precision i (0))?",
        "(1?",
        "C i (q)) The intuition behind all of these weighting schemes is to produce a weight for each QT method, by taking into account the confidence of the classifier, and/or the precision of the classifier on tuning instances.",
        "The computed weights are normalized before constructing the final query for retrieval: w final i (q) = w i (q)/ ?",
        "m j=1 w j (q) When compared empirically, we noticed that soft weighting is more effective than hard weight-ing, as the latter is more sensitive to classifier errors.",
        "Among the three soft weighting functions, differences were mostly negligible in our experiments.",
        "Hence, we decided to use the simplest weighting function w s1 .",
        "4.6 Analytical Model It is time-consuming to implement various combination-of-evidence approaches and run retrieval experiments.",

        "State-of-the-art English-Arabic (En- Ar) and English-Chinese (En-Ch) MT systems were trained on parallel corpora released in NIST OpenMT 2012, in addition to parallel forum data collected as part of the BOLT program (10m En-Ar words; 30m En-Ch words).",
        "From these data, word alignments were learned with GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), using five iterations of each of IBM Models 1?4 and HMM.",
        "3-gram Chinese and 5-gram Arabic Kneser-Ney language models were trained from the Gigaword corpus (1b words each) and non-English side of the training corpus.",
        "Chinese and English parallel text were preprocessed through the Treebank Tok-enizer, 4 while no special treatment was performed on Arabic.",
        "For retrieval, we used Indri, a state-of-the-art probabilistic relevance model that supports weighted query representations through operators #combine and #weight (Metzler and Croft, 2005).",
        "A character-based index was built for Chinese collections, whereas Arabic text was stemmed using Lucene before indexing.",
        "5 English text was preprocessed by Indri's implementation of the Porter stemmer (Porter, 1997).",
        "Statistics for each collection and query set are summarized in Table 1.",
        "Before performing any combination, we first ran the three baseline QT methods individually and evaluated the retrieved documents.",
        "Mean average precision (MAP) was used to measure retrieval effectiveness, which is a widely used and stable metric, estimating the area under the precision-recall curve.",
        "We set n = 10 for the n-best probabilistic translation method.",
        "Baseline scores are reported in Table 2.",
        "The average precision (AP) of each query in these tasks was used to label the query and construct training data accordingly.",
        "In subsequent sections, we evaluate the effect of several variants in the training pipeline.",
        "4 http://www.cis.upenn.edu/?treebank 5 http://lucene.apache.org 5.1 Effect of Labeling In Section 4.2, we introduced two ways to label instances.",
        "In our evaluation, we set the free parameters k 1 = k 2 = 90, which filters out 33% of queries from the training set of the BOLT ar task; this percentage is 29% in BOLT ch , 44% in TREC, and 27% in NTCIR.",
        "Labeling determines which query translation method is considered effective or not, which consequently determines what the ?learning problem?",
        "is (since the objective of the classifier is to separate differently labeled instances).",
        "As a result, there are two dimensions to consider when comparing labeling strategies.",
        "One is the accuracy of the classifiers on held-out data, and the other is how well the trained classifier reflects this accuracy when used in retrieval.",
        "To clarify the dis-tinction, consider a case where every instance is labeled 1.",
        "This generates a trivial learning problem with no test errors, yet this does not entail that using these classifiers in retrieval will be more effective than other labeling strategies.",
        "If, even with high classifier accuracy, the retrieval effectiveness is low, that indicates a bad choice for labeling.",
        "We can theoretically analyze how suitable each labeling method is by applying the analytical model to each CLIR task, setting parameters based on a perfect classifier: true positive/negative rate of 1 and false positive/negative rate of 0 (see Section 4.6).",
        "Table 2 shows these results in the ?Per- fect?",
        "column, since these scores represent what could be achieved if classifiers were trained to predict labels perfectly (no training or retrieval is actually performed).",
        "There are two values in each row of the ?Perfect?",
        "column, one for each labeling strategy.",
        "In each row, we found these two values to be statistically significantly higher than any of the baseline scores.",
        "This shows that both labeling approaches have the potential to improve effectiveness significantly.",
        "We also made an empirical comparison of the two labeling approaches by actually training classifiers with each labeling, and then using the classifiers to combine query translations in retrieval.",
        "The ?Trained?",
        "column in Table 2 shows the MAP we get on each CLIR task (and average classifier accuracies), using either labeling.",
        "6 Based on these results, we conclude that best-6 For a fair comparison, we fixed the train-tune setting to fully-open, trained classifiers on the test collection and reported leave-one-out accuracies.",

        "Best-by-rank yields better results only on TREC, but a closer look reveals that the increase in MAP is due to only two outlier queries.",
        "For BOLT ar , on the other hand, retrieval with best-by-measure labeling is more effective (statistically significant) than best-by-rank; hence, the former is used in remaining parts of our evaluation.",
        "5.2 Effect of Train-Tune Setting In Section 4.4, we introduced three major train-tune settings: fully-open, half-blind, and fully-blind.",
        "In order to implement these settings, we treat each of the three query sets (BOLT, TREC, NTCIR) as a separate training dataset and experiment with a variety of combinations.",
        "For simplicity, let us demonstrate the variety of experiments assuming the test collection is BOLT.",
        "For the fully-open case, the default training data is all of the BOLT queries (this training set is referred to as b).",
        "Additionally, one can include queries from TREC (referred to as t) and NTCIR (referred to as n) into the training data.",
        "This gives us four different training datasets for the fully-open case: b, b + n, b + t, b + t + n. Similarly, each of the half-blind and fully-blind settings can be applied to three different training sets: For BOLT, these are t, n, t + n. 7 This results in ten different experiments run for each task ?",
        "in each experiment, 7 In the case of half-blind, b is split into two: 20% is used for tuning and the remainder is used for testing.",
        "we train a classifier for each QT method, select the best meta-parameters on the tuning set, and then compute combination weights for retrieval using the classifiers.",
        "Each cell on the left side of Table 3 (under column ?Query-specific Combination?)",
        "shows the results of the most effective experiment for a particular task and train-tune setting.",
        "Accuracy values for classifiers varied widely across these experiments.",
        "Still, even when accuracies dropped close to or below 50% (i.e. random baseline), combined retrieval was always more effective than any single QT approach, which emphasizes the robustness of our approach.",
        "For instance, in the fully-blind setting for the NTCIR task, the individual classifiers had accuracies of only 56%, 49%, and 44% but MAP was 0.163, which is higher than the MAP of any individual method for that collection (0.146, 0.152, or 0.141).",
        "Another key observation in Table 3 is that the domain effect (i.e., training and/or tuning on queries similar to test queries) is only noticeable on the two BOLT tasks.",
        "For NTCIR and TREC, we do not observe a boost in MAP when queries from the same task are included in training (i.e., fully-open setting).",
        "This can be explained by the BOLT-centric nature of our system components: the text analysis tool and MT systems are tuned mainly for forum data, and the collection-based features are extracted from BOLT.",
        "Due to this bias, BOLT queries were most useful in our experi-ments, supported by the fact that BOLT is always 596 Task Query-specific Combination Uniform Task-Max fully-open half-blind fully-blind specific BOLT ar 0.342 ??",

        "Also, when there is no domain effect (i.e., half-blind and fully-blind ), more data yields higher effectiveness in 6 out of 8 cases (see two right columns on the left side of Table 3).",
        "5.3 Retrieval Effectiveness In this section, we compare our novel query-specific combination-of-evidence approach to the baseline CLIR approaches, as well as comparable combination methods (uniform and task-specific combination) in terms of retrieval effectiveness.",
        "Based on a randomized significance test (Smucker et al., 2007), the best query-specific combination method (shown in boldface in Table 3) outperforms all baseline QT methods in all tasks with 95% confidence (indicated by superscript * in Table 3).",
        "This is not the case for uniform or task-specific query combination, which are statistically indistinguishable from at least one of the QT methods, depending on the task (indicated by superscripts 1, 2, and 3 for one-best, probabilistic 10-best, and word-based QT methods, respec-tively).",
        "When we directly compare our query-specific combination approach to other combination methods, the differences are statistically significant for all tasks but NTCIR (indicated by superscript ?).",
        "For reference, we also computed effectiveness for a hypothetical system (denoted by ?Max?",
        "in Table 3) that could select the best QT method for each query and use only that for retrieval.",
        "This is not a strict upper bound, since correctly weighting each method can produce better results, but it is still a reasonable target for effectiveness.",
        "In our experiments, Arabic retrieval runs were very close to this target with our combination approach, while the gap for Chinese is still substantial, which is worth further exploration.",
        "6 Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we introduced a novel combination-of-evidence approach for CLIR, which learns a custom combination recipe for each query.",
        "We formulate this as a set of binary classification prob-lems, and show that trained classifiers can be used to produce query-specific combination weights effectively.",
        "Our deep exploration of many variants (e.g., labeling, training-tuning, weight computa-tion, analytical formulation) and extensive empirical analysis on four different tasks provide insights for future research on the under-studied problem of combining translations for CLIR.",
        "Our approach advances the state of the art of CLIR, yielding higher effectiveness than three advanced query translation approaches, all based on state-of-the-art MT systems.",
        "Furthermore, on three of the four tasks, our combination strategy is statistically significantly better than two comparable combination techniques.",
        "Experimental results also suggest that even a uniform combination of query translations is consistently better than any individual method.",
        "While it is known that combining translations helps CLIR, we confirm this on a set of modern CLIR tasks, including two target languages and a variety of text domains.",
        "Having a simple linear learning problem allows us to train robust models with relatively simpler features.",
        "Nevertheless, we are interested in experimenting with more sophisticated learning approaches.",
        "In terms of non-linear classifiers, our experience with decision trees in this paper indicated a higher tendency to overfit.",
        "In terms of 597 combining queries in a non-linear fashion, our future plans include integrating our approach into a LTR framework, and directly optimize MAP.",
        "This will also allow us to explore more complex features extracted from query and document text, as well as external sources.",
        "Another possible future endeavor is to extend these ideas to (i) other query translation approaches and (ii) document translation.",
        "While the exact same problem can be formulated for learning to translate documents effectively, a more complicated infrastructure and longer running times are two challenges that need to be considered.",
        "Finally, we hope this to be a significant step towards more context-dependent and robust CLIR models, by taking advantage of modern translation technologies, as well as machine learning techniques.",
