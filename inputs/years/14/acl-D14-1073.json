        "Despite many recent advances in query biased summarization for cross-language information retrieval (CLIR), there are no existing evaluation standards or datasets to make comparisons among different methods, and across different languages (Tombros and Sanderson, 1998; Pingali et al., 2007; McCallum et al., 2012; Bhaskar and Bandy-opadhyay, 2012).",
        "Consider that creating this kind of summary requires familiarity with techniques from machine translation (MT), summa-rization, and information retrieval (IR).",
        "In this This work was sponsored by the Federal Bureau of Investigation under Air Force Contract FA8721-05-C-0002.",
        "Opin-ions, interpretations, conclusions, and recommendations are those of the authors and are not necessarily endorsed by the United States Government.",
        "paper, we arrive at the intersection of each of these research areas.",
        "Query biased summarization (also known as query-focused, query-relevant, and query-dependent) involves automatically capturing relevant ideas and content from a document with respect to a given query, and presenting it as a condensed version of the original document.",
        "This kind of summarization is mostly used in search engines because when search results are tailored to a user's information need, the user can find texts that they are looking for more quickly and more accurately (Tombros and Sanderson, 1998; Mori et al., 2004).",
        "Query biased summarization is a valuable research area in natural language processing (NLP), especially for CLIR.",
        "Users of CLIR systems meet their information needs by submitting their queries in L 1 to search through documents that have been composed in L 2 , even though they may not be familiar with L 2 (Hovy et al., 1999; Pingali et al., 2007).",
        "There are no standards for objectively evaluating summaries for CLIR ?",
        "a research gap that we begin to address in this paper.",
        "The problem we explore is two-fold: what kinds of summaries are well-suited for CLIR applications, and how should the summaries be evaluated.",
        "Our evaluation is ex-trinsic, that is to say we are interested in how summarization affects performance on a different task (Mani et al., 2002; McKeown et al., 2005; Dorr et al., 2005; Murray et al., 2009; McCallum et al., 2012).",
        "We use relevance prediction as our extrinsic task: a human must decide if a summary for a given document is relevant to a particular information need, or not.",
        "Relevance prediction is known to be useful as it correlates with some automatic intrinsic methods as well (President and Dorr, 2006; Hobson et al., 2007).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply this evaluation framework to cross language query biased summarization.",
        "Each one of the summarization methods that we 657 present in this paper belongs to one of the following strategies: (1) unbiased full machine translated text, (2) unbiased word clouds, (3) query biased word clouds, and (4) query biased sentence summaries.",
        "The methods and strategies that we present are fast, cheap, and language-independent.",
        "All of these strategies are extractive, meaning that we used existing parts of a document to create the condensed version, or summary.",
        "We approach our task as an engineering prob-lem: the goal is to decide if summaries are good enough to help CLIR system users find what they are looking for.",
        "We have simplified the task by assuming that a set of documents has already been retrieved from a search engine, as CLIR techniques are outside the scope of this paper.",
        "We predict that showing the full MT English text as a summarization strategy would not be particularly helpful in our relevance prediction task because the words in the text could be mixed-up, or sentences could be nonsensical, resulting in poor readability.",
        "For the same reasons, we expect that showing the full MT English text would take longer to arrive at a relevance decision.",
        "Finally, we predict that query biased summaries will result in faster, more accurate decisions from the participants (Tombros and Sanderson, 1998).",
        "We treat the actual CLIR search engine as if it were a black box so that we can focus on evaluating if the summaries themselves are useful.",
        "As a starting point, we begin with some principles that we expect to hold true when we evaluate.",
        "These principles provide us with the kind of framework that we need for a productive and judicious discussion about how well a summarization method works.",
        "We encourage the NLP community to consider the following concepts when developing evaluation standards for this problem: ?",
        "End-user intelligiblity ?",
        "Query-salience ?",
        "Retrieval-relevance Summaries should be presented to the end-user in a way that is both concise and intelligible, even if the machine translated text is difficult to understand.",
        "Our notions of query-salience and retrieval-relevance capture the expectation that good summaries will be efficient enough to help end-users fulfill their information needs.",
        "For query-salience, we want users to positively identify relevant documents.",
        "Similarly, for retrieval-relevance we want users to be able to find as many relevant documents as possible.",
        "This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents related work; Section 3 describes our data and pre-processing; Section 4 details our summarization methods and strategies; Section 5 describes our experiments; Section 6 shows our results and analysis; and in Section 7, we conclude and discuss some future directions for the NLP community.",
        "2 Related Work Automatic summarization is generally a well-investigated research area.",
        "Summarization is a way of describing the relationships of words in documents to the information content of that document (Luhn, 1958; Edmunson, 1969; Salton and Yang, 1973; Robertson and Walker, 1994; Church and Gale, 1999; Robertson, 2004).",
        "Recent work has looked at creating summaries of single and multiple documents (Radev et al., 2004; Erkan and Radev, 2004; Wan et al., 2007; Yin et al., 2012; Chatterjee et al., 2012), as well as summary evaluation (Jing et al., 1998; Tombros and Sanderson 1998; Mani et al., 1998; Mani et al., 1999; Mani, 2001; Lin and Hovy, 2003; Lin, 2004; Nenkova et al., 2007; Hobson et al., 2007; Owczarzak et al., 2012), query and topic biased summarization (Berger and Mittal, 2000; Otterbacher et al., 2005; Daum√© and Marcu, 2006; Chali and Joty, 2008; Otterbacher et al., 2009; Bando et al., 2010; Bhaskar and Bandyopadhyay, 2012; Harwath and Hazen, 2012; Yin et al., 2012), and summarization across languages (Pingali et al., 2007; Or?asan and Chiorean, 2008; Wan et al., 2010; Azarbonyad et al., 2013).",
        "2.1 Query Biased Summarization Previous work most closely related to our own comes from Pingali et al., (2007).",
        "In their work, they present their method for cross-language query biased summarization for Telugu and English.",
        "Their work was motivated by the need for people to have access to foreign-language documents from a search engine even though the users were not familiar with the foreign language, in their case English.",
        "They used language model-ing and translation probability to translate a user's query into L 2 , and then summarized each document in L 2 with respect to the query.",
        "In their final step, they translated the summary from L 2 back 658 to L 1 for the user.",
        "They evaluated their method on the DUC 2005 query-focused summarization shared-task with ROUGE scores.",
        "We compare our methods to this work also on the DUC 2005 task.",
        "Our work demonstrates the first attempt to draw at a comparison between user-based studies and intrinsic evaluation with ROUGE.",
        "However, one of the limitations with evaluating this way is that the shared-task documents and queries are monolingual.",
        "Bhaskar and Bandyopadhyay (2012) tried a subjective evaluation of extractive cross-language query biased summarization for 7 different languages.",
        "They extracted sentences, then scored and ranked the sentences to generate query dependent snippets of documents for their cross lingual information access (CLIA) system.",
        "However, the snippet quality was determined subjectively based on scores on a scale of 0 to 1 (with 1 being best).",
        "Each score indicated annotator satisfaction for a given snippet.",
        "Our evaluation methodology is ob-jective: we ask users to decide if a given document is relevant to an information need, or not.",
        "2.2 Machine Translation Effects Machine translation quality can affect summarization quality.",
        "Wan et al. (2010) researched the effects of MT quality prediction on cross-language document summarization.",
        "They generated 5-sentence summaries in Chinese using English source documents.",
        "To select sentences, they used predicted translation quality, sentence posi-tion, and sentence informativeness.",
        "In their eval-uation, they employed 4 Chinese-speakers to subjectively rate summaries on a 5-point scale (5 being best) along the dimensions of content, read-ability, and overall impression.",
        "They showed that their approach of using MT quality scores did improve summarization quality on average.",
        "While their findings are important, their work did not address query biasing or objective evaluation of the summaries.",
        "We attempt to overcome limitations of machine translation quality by using word clouds as one of our summarization strategies.",
        "Knowing when to translate is another challenge for cross-language query biased summarization.",
        "Several options exist for when and what to translate during the summarization process: (1) the source documents can be translated, (2) the user's query can be translated, (3) the final summary can be translated, or (4) some combination of these.",
        "An example of translating only the summaries themselves can be found in Wan et al., (2010).",
        "On the other hand, Pingali et al. (2007) translated the queries and the summaries.",
        "In our work, we used gold-translated queries from the CLEF 2008 dataset, and machine translated source documents.",
        "We briefly address this in our work, but note that a full discussion of when and what to translate, and those effects on summarization quality, is outside of the scope of this paper.",
        "2.3 Summarization Evaluation There has been a lot of work towards developing metrics for understanding what makes a summary good.",
        "Evaluation metrics are either intrinsic or extrinsic.",
        "Intrinsic metrics, such as ROUGE, measure the quality of a summary with respect to gold human-generated summaries (Lin, 2004; Lin and Hovy, 2003).",
        "Generating gold standard summaries is expensive and time-consuming, a problem that persists with cross-language query biased summarization because those summaries must be query biased as well as in a different language from the source documents.",
        "On the other hand, extrinsic metrics measure the quality of summaries at the system level, by looking at overall system performance on downstream tasks (Jing et al., 1998; Tombros and Sanderson, 1998).",
        "One of the most important findings for query biased summarization comes from Tombros and Sanderson (1998).",
        "In their monolingual task-based evaluation, they measured user speed and accuracy at identifying relevant documents.",
        "They found that query biased summarization improved the user speed and accuracy when the user was asked to make relevance judgements for IR tasks.",
        "We also expect that our evaluation will demonstrate that user speed and accuracy is better when summaries are query biased.",
        "3 Data and Pre-Processing We used data from the Farsi CLEF 2008 ad hoc task (Agirre et al., 2009).",
        "Each of the queries included in this dataset consisted of a title, narrative, and description.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of the elements of a CLEF 2008 query.",
        "All of the automatic query-biasing in this work was based on the query titles.",
        "For our human relevance prediction task on Mechanical Turk, we used the narrative version.",
        "The CLEF 2008 dataset included a ground-truth answer key indicating which docu-659 ments were relevant to each query.",
        "For each query, we randomly selected 5 documents that were relevant as well as 5 documents that were not relevant.",
        "The subset of CLEF 2008 data that we used therefore consisted of 500 original Farsi documents and 50 parallel English-Farsi queries.",
        "Next we will describe our text pre-processing steps for both languages as well as how we created our parallel English documents.",
        "Figure 1: Full MT English summary and CLEF 2008 English query (title, description, narrative).",
        "3.1 English Documents All of our English documents were created automatically by translating the original Farsi documents into English (Drexler et al., 2012).",
        "The translated documents were sentence-aligned with one sentence per line.",
        "For all of our summarization experiments (except unbised full MT text), we processed the text as follows: removed extra spaces, removed punctuation, folded to lowercase, and removed digits.",
        "We also removed common English stopwords 2 from the texts.",
        "3.2 Farsi Documents We used the original CLEF 2008 Farsi documents for two of our summarization methods.",
        "We stemmed words in each document using automatic morphological analysis with Morfessor CatMAP.",
        "We note that within-sentence punctuation was removed during this process (Creutz and Lagus, 2007).",
        "We also removed Farsi stopwords and digits.",
        "4 Summarization Strategies All of our summarization methods were extractive except for unbiased full machine translated text.",
        "In this section, we describe each of our 13 summarization methods which we have organized into one of the following strategies: (1) unbiased full machine translated text, (2) unbiased 2 English and Farsi stopword lists from: http://members.unine.ch/jacques.savoy/clef/index.html word cloud summaries, (3) query biased word cloud summaries, and (4) query biased sentence summaries.",
        "Regardless of which summarization method used, we highlighted words in yellow that also appeard in the query.",
        "Let t be a term in document d where d ?",
        "D L and D L is a collection of documents in a particular language.",
        "Note that for our summarization methods, term weightings were calculated separately for each language.",
        "While |D| = 1000, we calculated term weightings based on |D E | = 500 and |D F | = 500.",
        "Finally, let q be a query where q ?",
        "Q and Q is our set of 50 parallel English-Farsi CLEF queries.",
        "Assume that log refers to log 10 .",
        "Figure 2: Full MT English summary and CLEF 2008 English query.",
        "4.1 Unbiased Full Machine Translated English Our first baseline approach was to use all of the raw machine translation output (no subsets of the sentences were used).",
        "Each summary therefore consisted of the full text of an entire document automatically translated from Farsi to English (Drexler et al., 2012).",
        "Figure 2 shows an example full text document translated from Farsi to English and a gold-standard English CLEF query.",
        "Note that we use this particular document-query pair as an example throughout this paper (docu- ment: H-770622-42472S8, query: 10.2452/552- AH).",
        "According to the CLEF answer key, the sample document is relevant to the sample query.",
        "4.2 Unbiased Word Clouds For our second baseline approach, we ranked terms in a document and displayed them as word clouds.",
        "Word clouds are one a way to arrange a collection of words where each word can vary 660 in size.",
        "We used word clouds as a summarization strategy to overcome any potential disfluen-cies from the machine translation output and also to see if they are feasible at all for summarization.",
        "All of our methods for word clouds used words from machine translated English text.",
        "Each term-ranking method below generates different ranked lists of terms, which we used to create different word clouds.",
        "We created one word cloud per document using the top 12 ranked words.",
        "We used the raw term scores to scale text font size, so that words with a highter score appeared larger and more prominent in a word cloud.",
        "Words were shuffled such that the exact ordering of words was at random.",
        "I: Term Frequency (TF) Term frequency is very commonly used for finding important terms in a document.",

        "Our gold-standard Farsi queries were included with our CLEF 2008 data, making them more reliable than what we could get from automatic translation.",
        "First, sentences from each Farsi document were scored with Farsi queries using LQ, described above.",
        "Then each LQ score was projected onto sentence-aligned English.",
        "We demonstrate LQP Figure 7: LQC Farsi sentence scores are combined with parallel English sentence scores to obtain sentence re-ranking.",
        "in Figure 6.",
        "By doing this, we simulated translating the user's English query into Farsi with the best possible query translation, before proceeding with summarization.",
        "This approach to cross-language summarization could be of interest for CLIR systems that do query translation on-the-fly.",
        "It is also of interest for summarization systems that need to utilize previously translated source documents the capability is lacking to translate summaries from L 2 to L 1 .",

        "Combinatory Query Biased Lexrank (LQC) Another variation of LexRank that we introduce in this work is LQC, which combines LexRank scores from both languages to re-rank sentences.",
        "A visual summary of this method is shown in Figure 7.",
        "We accomplished our re-ranking by first running LQ on Farsi and English separately, then adding the two scores together.",
        "This combination of Farsi and English scores provided us with a different way to score and rank sentences, compared with LQ and LQP .",
        "The idea behind combinatory query biased LexRank is to take advantage of sentences which are high-ranking in Farsi but not in English.",
        "The LQC method exploits all available resources in our dataset: L 1 and L 2 queries as well as L 1 and L 2 documents.",
        "5 Experiments We tested each of our summarization methods and overall strategies in a task-based evaluation framework using relevance prediction.",
        "We used Mechanical Turk for our experiments since it has been shown to be useful for evaluating NLP systems (Callison-Burch 2009; Gillick and Liu, 2010).",
        "We obtained human judgments for whether or not a document was considered relevant to a query, or information need.",
        "We measured the relevance 663 judgements by precision/recall/F1, accuracy, and also time-on-task based on the average response time per Human Intelligence Task (HIT).",
        "5.1 Mechanical Turk In our Mechanical Turk experiment, we used terminology from CLEF 2008 to describe a query as an ?information need?.",
        "All of the Mechanical Turk workers were presented with the following for their individual HIT: instructions, an information need and one summary for a document.",
        "Workers were asked to indicate if the given summary for a document was relevant to the given information need (Hobson et al., 2007).",
        "Workers were not shown the original Farsi source documents.",
        "We paid workers $0.01 per HIT.",
        "We obtained 5 HITs for each information need and summary pair.",

        "We report performance for 13 individual methods as well as overall peformance on the 4 different summarization strategies.",
        "To calculate the performance for each strategy, we used the arithmetic mean of the corresponding individual methods.",
        "We measured preci-sion, recall and F1 to give us a sense of our summaries might influence document retrieval in an actual CLIR system.",
        "We also measured accuracy and time-on-task.",
        "For these latter two metrics, we distinguish between summaries that were relevant (R) and non-relevant (NR).",
        "All of the summarization-based methods fa-vored recall over precision: documents were marked ?relevant?",
        "more often than ?non-relevant?.",
        "For many of the methods shown in Table 1, workers spent more time correctly deciding ?relevant?",
        "than correctly deciding ?non-relevant?.",
        "This suggests some workers participated in our Mechanical Turk task purposefully.",
        "For many of the summarization methods, workers were able to positively identify relevant documents.",
        "From Table 1 we see that Full MT performed better on precision than all of the other methods and strategies, but we note that performance on precision was generally very low.",
        "This might be due to Mechanical Turk workers overgeneraliz-ing by marking summaries as relevant when they were not.",
        "Some individual methods preserve our principle of retrieval-relevance, as indicated by the higher recall scores for SQF, LQEF, and TFQ.",
        "That is to say, these particular query biased summarization methods can be used to assist users with identifying more relevant documents.",
        "The accuracy on relevant documents addresses our principle of query-salience, and it is especially high for our query-biased methods: LQEF, SQF, LQ, and TFQ.",
        "The results also seem to fit our intuition that the summary in Figure 3 seems less relevant to the summaries shown in Figures 4 & 5 even though these are the same documents biased on the same query ?Tehran stock market?.",
        "Overall, query biased word clouds outperform the other summarization strategies for 5 out of 7 metrics.",
        "This could be due to the fact that word clouds provide a very concise and overview of a document, which is one of the main goals for automatic summarization.",
        "Along these lines, word clouds are probably not subject to the effects of MT quality and we believe it is possible that MT quality could have had a negative impact on our query biased extracted sentence summaries, as well as our full MT English texts.",

        "We want to be able to say that we can do query biased summarization just as well for both monolingual and cross-language IR systems.",

        "We attempted to address this issue with two of our meth-ods: LQP and LQC.",

        "Our findings support the findings of Tombros and Sanderson (1998).",
        "Another important finding is that now we can weigh tradeoffs so that different summarization methods could be used to optimize over different metrics.",
        "For example, if we want to optimize for retrieval-relevance we might select a summarization method that tends to have higher recall, such as scaled query biased term frequency (SFQ).",
        "Similarly, we could optimize over accuracy on relevant documents, and use Combinatory LexRank (LQC) with Farsi and English together.",
        "We have shown that the relevance prediction tasks can be crowdsourced on Mechanical Turk with reasonable results.",
        "The data we used from the Farsi CLEF 2008 ad-hoc task included an answer key, but there were no parallel English documents.",
        "However, in order for the NLP community to make strides in evaluating cross-language query biased summarization for CLIR, we will need star-dards and data.",
        "Optimal data would be parallel datasets consisting of documents in L 1 and L 2 with queries in L 1 and L 2 along with an answer key specifying which documents are relevant to the queries.",
        "Further we would also need sets of human gold-standard query biased summaries in L 1 and L 2 .",
        "These standards and data would allow us to compare method-to-method across different languages, while simultaneously allowing us to tease apart other variables such as: when and what to translate, translation quality, methods for biasing, and type of summarization strategy (sen- tences, words, etc).",
        "And of course it would be better if this standard dataset was multilingual instead of billingual, for obvious reasons.",
        "We have approached cross-language query biased summarization as a stand-alone problem, treating the CLIR system and document retrieval as a black box.",
        "However, summaries need to preserve query-salience: summaries should not make it more difficult to positively identify relavant documents.",
        "And they should also preserve retrieval-relevance: summaries should help users identify as many relevant documents as possible.",
