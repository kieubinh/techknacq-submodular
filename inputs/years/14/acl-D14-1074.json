        "Classical poems are a significant part of China's cultural heritage.",
        "Their popularity manifests itself in many aspects of everyday life, e.g., as a means of expressing personal emotion, political views, or communicating messages at festive occasions as well as funerals.",
        "Amongst the many different types of classical Chinese poetry, quatrain and regulated verse are perhaps the best-known ones.",
        "Both types of poem must meet a set of structural, phonological, and semantic requirements, rendering their composition a formidable task left to the very best scholars.",
        "An example of a quatrain is shown in Table 1.",
        "Quatrains have four lines, each five or seven characters long.",
        "Characters in turn follow specific phonological patterns, within each line and across lines.",
        "For instance, the final characters in the sec-ond, fourth and (optionally) first line must rhyme, ??",
        "Missing You ??????",
        "(* Z P P Z) Red berries born in the warm southland.",
        "??????",
        "(P P Z Z P) How many branches flush in the spring?",
        "?",
        "?????",
        "(* P P Z Z) Take home an armful, for my sake, ??????",
        "(* Z Z P P) As a symbol of our love.",
        "Table 1: An example of a 5-char quatrain exhibiting one of the most popular tonal patterns.",
        "The tone of each character is shown at the end of each line (within parentheses); P and Z are short-hands for Ping and Ze tones, respectively; * indicates that the tone is not fixed and can be either.",
        "Rhyming characters are shown in boldface.",
        "whereas there are no rhyming constraints for the third line.",
        "Moreover, poems must follow a prescribed tonal pattern.",
        "In traditional Chinese, every character has one tone, Ping (level tone) or Ze (downward tone).",
        "The poem in Table 1 exemplifies one of the most popular tonal patterns (Wang, 2002).",
        "Besides adhering to the above formal crite-ria, poems must exhibit concise and accurate use of language, engage the reader/hearer, stimulate their imagination, and bring out their feelings.",
        "In this paper we are concerned with generating traditional Chinese poems automatically.",
        "Although computers are no substitute for poetic cre-ativity, they can analyze very large online text repositories of poems, extract statistical patterns, maintain them in memory and use them to generate many possible variants.",
        "Furthermore, while amateur poets may struggle to remember and apply formal tonal and structural constraints, it is relatively straightforward for the machine to check 670 whether a candidate poem conforms to these requirements.",
        "Poetry generation has received a fair amount of attention over the past years (see the discussion in Section 2), with dozens of computational systems written to produce poems of varying sophistication.",
        "Beyond the long-term goal of building an autonomous intelligent system capable of creating meaningful poems, there are potential short-term applications for computer generated poetry in the ever growing industry of electronic entertainment and interactive fiction as well as in education.",
        "An assistive environment for poem composition could allow teachers and students to create poems subject to their require-ments, and enhance their writing experience.",
        "We propose a model for Chinese poem generation based on recurrent neural networks.",
        "Our generator jointly performs content selection (?what to say?)",
        "and surface realization (?how to say?).",
        "Given a large collection of poems, we learn representations of individual characters, and their combinations into one or more lines as well as how these mutually reinforce and constrain each other.",
        "Our model generates lines in a poem probabilis-tically: it estimates the probability of the current line given the probability of all previously generated lines.",
        "We use a recurrent neural network to learn the representations of the lines generated so far which in turn serve as input to a recurrent language model (Mikolov et al., 2010; Mikolov et al., 2011b; Mikolov et al., 2011a) which generates the current line.",
        "In contrast to previous approaches (Greene et al., 2010; Jiang and Zhou, 2008), our generator makes no Markov assumptions about the dependencies of the words within a line and across lines.",
        "We evaluate our approach on the task of quatrain generation (see Table 1 for a human-written example).",
        "Experimental results show that our model outperforms competitive Chinese poetry generation systems using both automatic and manual evaluation methods.",
        "2 Related Work Automated poetry generation has been a popular research topic over the past decades (see Colton et al. (2012) and the references therein).",
        "Most approaches employ templates to construct poems according to a set of constraints (e.g., rhyme, me-ter, stress, word frequency) in combination with corpus-based and lexicographic resources.",
        "For example, the Haiku poem generator presented in Wu et al. (2009) and Tosa et al. (2008) produces poems by expanding user queries with rules extracted from a corpus and additional lexical resources.",
        "Netzer et al. (2009) generate Haiku with Word Association Norms, Agirrezabal et al. (2013) compose Basque poems using patterns based on parts of speech and WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), and Oliveira (2012) presents a generation algorithm for Portuguese which leverages semantic and grammar templates.",
        "A second line of research uses genetic algorithms for poem generation (Manurung, 2003; Manurung et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2010).",
        "Manurung et al. (2012) argue that at a basic level all (machine-generated) poems must satisfy the constraints of grammaticality (i.e., a poem must syntactically well-formed), meaningfulness (i.e., a poem must convey a message that is meaningful under some interpretation) and poeticness (i.e., a poem must exhibit features that distinguishes it from non-poetic text, e.g., metre).",
        "Their model generates several candidate poems and then uses stochastic search to find those which are grammat-ical, meaningful, and poetic.",
        "A third line of research draws inspiration from statistical machine translation (SMT) and related text-generation applications such as sum-marization.",
        "Greene et al. (2010) infer meters (stressed/unstressed syllable sequences) from a corpus of poetic texts which they subsequently use for generation together with a cascade of weighted finite-state transducers interpolated with IBM Model 1.",
        "Jiang and Zhou (2008) generate Chinese couplets (two line poems) using a phrase-based SMT approach which translates the first line to the second line.",
        "He et al. (2012) extend this algorithm to generate four-line quatrains by sequentially translating the current line from the previous one.",
        "Yan et al. (2013) generate Chinese quatrains based on a query-focused summarization framework.",
        "Their system takes a few keywords as input and retrieves the most relevant poems from a corpus collection.",
        "The retrieved poems are segmented into their constituent terms which are then grouped into clusters.",
        "Poems are generated by iteratively selecting terms from clusters subject to phonolog-ical, structural, and coherence constraints.",
        "Our approach departs from previous work in two important respects.",

        "Phrases are then used to generate the first line.",
        "Following lines are generated by taking into account the representations of all previously generated lines.",
        "using recurrent neural networks.",
        "Structural, se-mantic, and coherence constraints are captured naturally in our framework, through learning the representations of individual characters and their combinations.",
        "Secondly, generation proceeds by taking into account multi-sentential context rather than the immediately preceding sentence.",
        "Our work joins others in using continuous representations to express the meaning of words and phrases (Socher et al., 2012; Mikolov et al., 2013) and how these may be combined in a language modeling context (Mikolov and Zweig, 2012).",
        "More recently, continuous translation models based on recurrent neural networks have been proposed as a means to map a sentence from the source language to sentences in the target language (Auli et al., 2013; Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013).",
        "These models are evaluated on the task of rescor-ing n-best lists of translations.",
        "We use neural networks more directly to perform the actual poem generation task.",
        "3 The Poem Generator As common in previous work (Yan et al., 2013; He et al., 2012) we assume that our generator operates in an interactive context.",
        "Specifically, the user supplies keywords (e.g., spring, lute, drunk ) highlighting the main concepts around which the poem will revolve.",
        "As illustrated in Figure 1, our generator expands these keywords into a set of related phrases.",
        "We assume the keywords are restricted to those attested in the ShiXueHanYing poetic phrase taxonomy (He et al., 2012; Yan et al., 2013).",
        "The latter contains 1,016 manual clusters of phrases (Liu, 1735); each cluster is labeled with a keyword id describing general poem-worthy topics.",
        "The generator creates the first line of the poem based on these keywords.",
        "Subsequent lines are generated based on all previously generated lines, subject to phonological (e.g., admissible tonal pat-terns) and structural constraints (e.g., whether the quatrain is five or seven characters long).",
        "To create the first line, we select all phrases corresponding to the user's keywords and generate all possible combinations satisfying the tonal pattern constraints.",
        "We use a language model to rank the generated candidates and select the best-ranked one as the first line in the poem.",
        "In im-plementation, we employ a character-based recurrent neural network language model (Mikolov et al., 2010) interpolated with a Kneser-Ney trigram and find the n-best candidates with a stack decoder (see Section 3.5 for details).",

        "Also note, that in our model surface generation depends on the last observed character and the state of the hidden layer before this observation.",
        "This way, there is no explicitly defined context, and history is captured implicitly by the recurrent nature of the model.",
        "This can be problematic for our texts which must obey certain stylistic conventions and sound poetic.",
