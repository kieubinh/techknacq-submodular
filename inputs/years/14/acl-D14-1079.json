        "Neural word embeddings (Bengio et al., 2006; Collobert and Weston, 2008; Mikolov et al., 2013a) have received much attention in the distributional semantics community, and have shown state-of-the-art performance in many natural language processing tasks.",
        "While they have been compared with co-occurrence based models in simple similarity tasks at the word level (Levy et al., 2014; Baroni et al., 2014), we are aware of only one work that attempts a comparison of the two approaches in compositional settings (Blacoe and Lapata, 2012), and this is limited to additive and multiplicative composition, compared against composition via a neural autoencoder.",
        "The purpose of this paper is to provide a more complete picture regarding the potential of neural word embeddings in compositional tasks, and meaningfully compare them with the traditional distributional approach based on co-occurrence counts.",
        "We are especially interested in investigating the performance of neural word vectors in compositional models involving general mathematical composition operators, rather than in the more task-or domain-specific deep-learning compositional settings they have generally been used with so far (for example, by Socher et al. (2012), Kalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013) and many oth-ers).",
        "In particular, this is the first large-scale study to date that applies neural word representations in tensor-based compositional distributional models of meaning similar to those formalized by Coecke et al. (2010).",
        "We test a range of implementations based on this framework, together with additive and multiplicative approaches (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008), in a variety of different tasks.",
        "Specif-ically, we use the verb disambiguation task of Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh (2011a) and the transitive sentence similarity task of Kartsaklis and Sadrzadeh (2014) as small-scale focused experiments on pre-defined sentence structures.",
        "Addi-tionally, we evaluate our vector spaces on paraphrase detection (using the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus of Dolan et al. (2005)) and dialogue act tagging using the Switchboard Corpus (see e.g. (Stolcke et al., 2000)).",
        "In all of the above tasks, we compare the neural word embeddings of Mikolov et al. (2013a) with two vector spaces both based on co-occurrence counts and produced by standard distributional techniques, as described in detail below.",
        "The general picture we get from the results is that in almost all cases the neural vectors are more effective than the traditional approaches.",
        "We proceed as follows: Section 2 provides a concise introduction to distributional word representations in natural language processing.",
        "Section 708 3 takes a closer look to the subject of compositionality in vector space models of meaning and describes the range of compositional operators examined here.",
        "In Section 4 we provide details about the vector spaces used in the experiments.",
        "Our experimental work is described in detail in Section 5, and the results are discussed in Section 6.",
        "Finally, Section 7 provides conclusions.",
        "2 Meaning representation There are several approaches to the representation of word, phrase and sentence meaning.",
        "As natural languages are highly creative and it is very rare to see the same sentence twice, any practical approach dealing with large text segments must be compositional, constructing the meaning of phrases and sentences from their constituent parts.",
        "The ideal method would therefore express not only the similarity in meaning between those constituent parts, but also between the results of their composition, and do this in ways which fit with linguistic structure and generalisations thereof.",
        "Formal semantics Formal approaches to the semantics of natural language have long built upon the classical idea of compositionality ?",
        "that the meaning of a sentence is a function of the meanings of its parts (Frege, 1892).",
        "In compositional type-logical approaches, predicate-argument structures representing phrases and sentences are built from their constituent parts by ?- reduction within the lambda calculus framework (Montague, 1970): for example, given a representation of John as john ?",
        "and sleeps as ?x.sleep ?",
        "(x), the meaning of the sentence ?John sleeps?",
        "can be constructed as ?x.sleep ?",
        "(x)(john ? )",
        "= sleep ?",
        "(john ?",
        ").",
        "Given a suitable pairing between words and semantic representations of them, this method can produce structured sentential representations with broad coverage and good generalisability (see e.g. (Bos, 2008)).",
        "The above logical approach is extremely powerful because it can capture complex aspects of meaning such as quantifiers and their interaction (see e.g. (Copestake et al., 2005)), and enables inference using well studied and developed logical methods (see e.g. (Bos and Gabsdil, 2000)).",
        "Distributional hypothesis However, such formal approaches are less able to express similarity in meaning.",
        "We would like to capture the intuition that while John and Mary are distinct, they are rather similar to each other (both of them are humans) and dissimilar to words such as dog, pavement or idea.",
        "The same applies at the phrase and sentence level: ?dogs chase cats?",
        "is similar in meaning to ?hounds pursue kittens?, but less so to ?cats chase dogs?",
        "(despite the lexical overlap).",
        "Distributional methods provide a way to address this problem.",
        "By representing words and phrases as vectors or tensors in a (usually highly dimen-sional) vector space, one can express similarity in meaning via a suitable distance metric within that space (usually cosine distance); furthermore, composition can be modelled via suitable linear-algebraic operations.",
        "Co-occurrence-based word representations One way to produce such vectorial representations is to directly exploit Harris (1954)'s intuition that semantically similar words tend to appear in similar contexts.",
        "We can construct a vector space in which the dimensions correspond to contexts, usually taken to be words as well.",
        "The word vector components can then be calculated from the frequency with which a word has co-occurred with the corresponding contexts in a window of words, with a predefined length.",
        "Table 1 shows 5 3-dimensional vectors for the words Mary, John, girl, boy and idea.",
        "The words philosophy, book and school signify vector space dimensions.",
        "As the vector for John is closer to Mary than it is to idea in the vector space?a direct consequence of the fact that John's contexts are similar to Mary's and dissimilar to idea?s?we can infer that John is semantically more similar to Mary than to idea.",
        "Many variants of this approach exist: performance on word similarity tasks has been shown to be improved by replacing raw counts with weighted values (e.g. mutual information)?see (Turney et al., 2010) and below for discussion, and (Kiela and Clark, 2014) for a detailed comparison.",

        "709 Neural word embeddings Deep learning techniques exploit the distributional hypothesis differently.",
        "Instead of relying on observed co-occurrence frequencies, a neural language model is trained to maximise some objective function related to e.g. the probability of observing the surrounding words in some context (Mikolov et al., 2013b): 1 T T ?",
        "t=1 ?",
        "?c?j?c,j 6=0 log p(w t+j |w t ) (1) Optimizing the above function, for example, produces vectors which maximise the conditional probability of observing words in a context around the target word w t , where c is the size of the training window, and w 1 w 2 , ?",
        "?",
        "?w T a sequence of words forming a training instance.",
        "Therefore, the resulting vectors will capture the distributional intuition and can express degrees of lexical similarity.",
        "This method has an obvious advantage compared to co-occurrence method: since now the context is predicted, the model in principle can be much more robust in data sparsity prob-lems, which is always an important issue for co-occurrence word spaces.",
        "Additionally, neural vectors have also proven successful in other tasks (Mikolov et al., 2013c), since they seem to encode not only attributional similarity (the degree to which similar words are close to each other), but also relational similarity (Turney, 2006).",
        "For ex-ample, it is possible to extract the singular:plural relation (apple:apples, car:cars) using vector sub-traction: ????",

        "queen as the result.",
        "1 Both neural and co-occurrence-based approaches have advantages over classical formal approaches in their ability to capture lexical semantics and degrees of similarity; their success at 1 Levy et al. (2014) improved Mikolov et al. (2013c)'s method of retrieving relational similarities by changing the underlying objective function.",
        "extending this to the sentence level and to more complex semantic phenomena, though, depends on their applicability within compositional mod-els, which is the subject of the next section.",
        "3 Compositional models Compositional distributional models represent meaning of a sequence of words by a vector, obtained by combining meaning vectors of the words within the sequence using some vector composition operation.",
        "In a general classification of these models, one can distinguish between three broad cases: simplistic models which combine word vectors irrespective of their order or relation to one another, models which exploit linear word order, and models which use grammatical structure.",
        "The first approach combines word vectors by vector addition or point-wise multiplication (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008)?as this is independent of word order, it cannot capture the difference between the two sentences ?dogs chase cats?",
        "and ?cats chase dogs?.",
        "The second approach has generally been implemented using some form of deep learning, and captures word order, but not by necessarily caring about the grammatical structure of the sentence.",
        "Here, one works by recursively building and combining vectors for subsequences of words within the sentence using e.g. autoen-coders (Socher et al., 2012) or convolutional filters (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014).",
        "We do not consider this approach in this paper.",
        "This is because, as mentioned in the introduction, their vectors and composition operators are task-specific.",
        "These are trained directly to achieve specific objectives in certain pre-determined tasks.",
        "We are interested in vector and composition operators that work for any compositional task, and which can be combined with results in linguistics and formal semantics to provide generalisable models that can canonically extend to complex semantic phenomena.",
        "The third (i.e. the grammatical) approach promises a way to achieve this, and has been instantiated in various ways in the work of Baroni and Zamparelli (2010),Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh (2011a), and Kartsaklis et al. (2012).",

        "The choice of compositional operator seems to be more important and more task-specific: while a tensor-based operation (Frobe- nius copy-object) performs best for verb disam-biguation, the best result for sentence similarity is achieved by a simple additive model, with all other compositional methods behaving worse than the verb-only baseline in the KS14 case.",
