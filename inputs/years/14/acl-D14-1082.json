        "In recent years, enormous parsing success has been achieved by the use of feature-based discriminative dependency parsers (K?ubler et al., 2009).",
        "In particular, for practical applications, the speed of the subclass of transition-based dependency parsers has been very appealing.",
        "However, these parsers are not perfect.",
        "First, from a statistical perspective, these parsers suffer from the use of millions of mainly poorly estimated feature weights.",
        "While in aggregate both lexicalized features and higher-order interaction term features are very important in improving the performance of these systems, nevertheless, there is insufficient data to correctly weight most such features.",
        "For this reason, techniques for introducing higher-support features such as word class features have also been very successful in improving parsing performance (Koo et al., 2008).",
        "Second, almost all existing parsers rely on a manually designed set of feature templates, which require a lot of expertise and are usually incomplete.",
        "Third, the use of many feature templates cause a less studied problem: in modern dependency parsers, most of the runtime is consumed not by the core parsing algorithm but in the feature extraction step (He et al., 2013).",
        "For instance, Bohnet (2010) reports that his baseline parser spends 99% of its time doing feature extraction, despite that being done in standard efficient ways.",
        "In this work, we address all of these problems by using dense features in place of the sparse indicator features.",
        "This is inspired by the recent success of distributed word representations in many NLP tasks, e.g., POS tagging (Collobert et al., 2011), machine translation (Devlin et al., 2014), and constituency parsing (Socher et al., 2013).",
        "Low-dimensional, dense word embeddings can effectively alleviate sparsity by sharing statistical strength between similar words, and can provide us a good starting point to construct features of words and their interactions.",
        "Nevertheless, there remain challenging problems of how to encode all the available information from the configuration and how to model higher-order features based on the dense representations.",
        "In this paper, we train a neural network classifier to make parsing decisions within a transition-based dependency parser.",
        "The neural network learns compact dense vector representations of words, part-of-speech (POS) tags, and dependency labels.",
        "This results in a fast, compact classifier, which uses only 200 learned dense features while yielding good gains in parsing accuracy and speed on two languages (English and Chinese) and two different dependency representations (CoNLL and Stanford dependencies).",
        "The main contributions of this work are: (i) showing the usefulness of dense representations that are learned within the parsing task, (ii) developing a neural network architecture that gives good accuracy and speed, and (iii) introducing a novel acti-740 vation function for the neural network that better captures higher-order interaction features.",
        "2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing Transition-based dependency parsing aims to predict a transition sequence from an initial configuration to some terminal configuration, which derives a target dependency parse tree, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "In this paper, we examine only greedy parsing, which uses a classifier to predict the correct transition based on features extracted from the configuration.",
        "This class of parsers is of great interest because of their efficiency, although they tend to perform slightly worse than the search-based parsers because of subsequent error propagation.",
        "However, our greedy parser can achieve comparable accuracy with a very good speed.",
        "1 As the basis of our parser, we employ the arc-standard system (Nivre, 2004), one of the most popular transition systems.",
