        "Much of everyday language and discourse concerns the visual world around us, making understanding the relationship between objects in the physical world and language describing those objects an important challenge problem for AI.",
        "From robotics, to image search, to situated language learning, and natural language grounding, there are a number of research areas that would benefit from a better understanding of how people refer to physical entities in the world.",
        "Recent advances in automatic computer vision methods have started to make technologies for recognizing thousands of object categories a near reality (Perronnin et al., 2012; Deng et al., 2012; Deng et al., 2010; Krizhevsky et al., 2012).",
        "As a result, there has been a spurt of recent work trying to estimate higher level semantics, including exciting efforts to automatically produce natural language descriptions of images and video (Farhadi et ?",
        "Indicates equal author contribution.",
        "al., 2010; Kulkarni et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2011; Ordonez et al., 2011; Kuznetsova et al., 2012; Feng and Lapata, 2013).",
        "Common challenges encountered in these pursuits include the fact that descriptions can be highly task dependent, open-ended, and difficult to evaluate automatically.",
        "Therefore, we look at the related, but more focused problem of referring expression generation (REG).",
        "Previous work on REG has made significant progress toward understanding how people generate expressions to refer to objects (a recent survey of techniques is provided in Krahmer and van Deemter (2012)).",
        "In this paper, we study the relatively unexplored setting of how people refer to objects in complex photographs of real-world cluttered scenes.",
        "One initial stumbling block to examining this scenario is lack of existing relevant datasets, as previous collections for studying REG have used relatively focused domains such as graphics generated objects (van Deemter et al., 2006; Viethen and Dale, 2008), crafts (Mitchell et al., 2010), or small everyday (home and office) objects arrayed on a simple background (Mitchell et al., 2013a; FitzGerald et al., 2013).",
        "In this paper, we collect a new large-scale cor-pus, currently containing 130,525 expressions, referring to 96,654 distinct objects, in 19,894 photographs of real world scenes.",
        "Some examples from our dataset are shown in Figure 5.",
        "To construct this corpus efficiently, we design a new two player referring expression game (ReferItGame) to crowd-source the data collection.",
        "Popularized by efforts like the ESP game (von Ahn and Dabbish, 2004) and Peekaboom (von Ahn et al., 2006b), Human Computation based games can be an effective way to engage users and collect large amounts of data inexpensively.",
        "Two player games can also automate verification of human provided annotations.",
        "Our resulting corpus is both more real-world and much bigger than previous datasets, allowing 787 us to examine referring expression generation in a new setting at large scale.",
        "To understand and quantify this new dataset, we perform an extensive set of analyses.",
        "One significant difference from previous work is that we study how referring expressions vary for different categories.",
        "We find that an object's category greatly influences the types of attributes used in their referring expression (e.g. people use color words to describe cars more often than mountains).",
        "Additionally, we find that references to an object are sometimes made with respect to other nearby objects, e.g. ?the ball to left of the man?.",
        "Interestingly, the types of reference objects (i.e. ?the man?)",
        "used in referring expressions is also biased toward some categories.",
        "Finally, we find that the word used to refer to the object category itself displays consistencies across people.",
        "This notion is related to ideas of entry-level categories from Psychology (Rosch, 1978).",
        "Given these findings, we propose an optimization model for generating referring expressions that jointly selects which attributes to include in the expression, and what attribute values to generate.",
        "This model incorporates both visual models for selecting attribute-values and object category specific priors.",
        "Experimental evaluations indicate that our proposed model produces reasonable results for REG.",

        "Then we describe our online game for collecting referring expressions (?3) and provide an analysis of our new ReferItGame Dataset (?4).",
        "Finally, we present and evaluate our model for generating referring expressions (?5) and discuss conclusions and future work (?6).",
        "2 Related Work Referring Expression Generation: There has been a long history of research on understanding how people generate referring expressions, dating back to the 1970s (Winograd, 1972).",
        "One common approach is the Incremental Algorithm (Dale and Reiter, 1995; Dale and Reiter, 2000) which uses logical expressions for generation.",
        "Much work in REG follows the Gricean maxims (Grice, 1975) which provide principles for how people will behave in conversation.",
        "Recently, there has been progress examining other aspects of the referring expression problem such as understanding what types of attributes are used (Mitchell et al., 2013a), modeling variations between speakers (Viethen and Dale, 2010; Viethen et al., 2013; Van Deemter et al., 2012; Mitchell et al., 2013b), incorporating visual classifiers (Mitchell et al., 2011), producing algorithms to refer to object sets (Ren et al., 2010; FitzGerald et al., 2013), or examining impoverished perception REG (Fang et al., 2013).",
        "A good survey of work in this area is provided in Krahmer and van Deemter (2012).",
        "We build on past work, extending models to generate attributes jointly in a category specific framework.",
        "Referring Expression Datasets: Some initial datasets in REG used graphics engines to produce images of objects (van Deemter et al., 2006; Viethen and Dale, 2008).",
        "Recently more realistic datasets have been introduced, consisting of craft objects like pipecleaners, ribbons, and feathers (Mitchell et al., 2010), or everyday home and office objects such as staplers, combs, or rulers (Mitchell et al., 2013a), arrayed on a simple background.",
        "These datasets helped moved referring expression generation research into the domain of real world objects.",
        "We seek to further these pursuits by constructing a dataset of natural objects in photographs of the real world.",
        "Image & Video Description Generation: Recent research on automatic image description has followed two main directions.",
        "Retrieval based methods (Aker and Gaizauskas, 2010; Farhadi et al., 2010; Ordonez et al., 2011; Feng and Lapata, 2010; Feng and Lapata, 2013) retrieve existing captions or phrases to describe a query image.",
        "Bottom up methods (Kulkarni et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2011; Yao et al., 2010) rely on visual classifiers to first recognize image content and then construct captions from scratch, perhaps with some 788 Figure 1: An example game.",
        "Player 1 (left) sees an image with an object outlined in red (the man) and provides a referring expression for the object (?man in red shirt on horse?).",

        "Elapsed time and current scores are also provided.",
        "input from natural language statistics.",
        "Very re-cently, these ideas have been extended to produce descriptions for videos (Guadarrama et al., 2013; Barbu et al., 2012).",
        "Like these methods, we generate descriptions for natural scenes, but focus on referring to particular objects rather than providing an overall description of an image or video.",
        "Human Computation Games: Games can be a useful tool for collecting large amounts of labeled data quickly.",
        "Human Computation Games were first introduced by Luis von Ahn in the ESP game (von Ahn and Dabbish, 2004) for image la-beling, and later extended to segment objects (von Ahn et al., 2006b), collect common-sense knowledge (von Ahn et al., 2006a), or disambiguate words (Seemakurty et al., 2010).",
        "Recently, crowd games have also been introduced into the computer vision community for tasks like fine grained category recognition (Deng et al., 2013).",
        "These games can be released publicly on the web or used on Mechanical Turk to enhance and encourage turker participation (Deng et al., 2013).",

        "If Player 2 clicks on the correct object, then both players receive game points and the Player 1 and Player 2 roles swap for the next image.",
        "If Player 2 does not click on the correct object then no points are received and the players remain in their current roles.",
        "This provides us with referring expressions for our dataset and verification that the expressions are valid since they led to correct object localizations.",
        "Expressions written for games where the object was not correctly localized are kept and released with the dataset for future study, but are not included in our final dataset analyses or statistics.",
        "A game timer encourages players to write expressions quickly, resulting in more natural expressions.",
        "Also, IP addresses are filtered to prevent people from simultaneously playing both roles.",

        "game against the computer.",
        "If at any point another person connects, the canned game ends and the player is paired with the new person.",
        "To implement canned games we seed the game with 5000 pre-recorded referring expression games (5 referring expressions and resulting clicks 789 for each of 1000 objects) collected using Ama-zon's Mechanical Turk service.",
        "Implementing an automated version of Player 1 is simple; we just show the person one of the pre-collected referring expressions and they click as usual.",
        "Automating the role of Player 2 is a bit more complicated.",
        "In this case, we compare the per-son's written expression against the pre-recorded expressions for the same object.",
        "For this comparison we use a parser to lemmatize the words in an expression and then compute cosine similarity between expressions with a bag of words representation.",
        "Based on this measure the closest matching expression is determined.",
        "If there is no similarity between the newly generated expression and the canned expressions, the expression is deemed incorrect and a random click location (outside of the object) is generated.",
        "If there is a successful match with a previously generated expression, then the canned click from the most similar pre-recorded game is used.",
        "More complex similarities could be used, but since we require real-time performance in our game setting we use this simple implementation which works well for our expressions.",

        "?",
        "Available at http://tamaraberg.com/referitgame 4.2 Collecting the Dataset From the ImageCLEF dataset, we created a total of over 100k distinct games (one per object labeled in the dataset).",
        "For the games we imposed an ordering to allow for collecting the most interesting expressions first.",
        "Initially we prioritized games for objects in images with multiple objects of the same category.",
        "Once these games were completed, we prioritized ordering based on object category to include a comprehensive range of objects.",
        "Finally, after successfully collecting referring expressions from the prioritized games, we posted games for the remaining objects.",
        "In order to evaluate consistency of expression generation across people, we also include a probability of repeating previously played games during collection.",
        "To date, we have collected 130,525 successfully completed games.",

        "Turkers were paid upon completion of 10 correct games (games where Player 2 clicks on the correct object of interest).",
        "Turkers were pre-screened to have approval ratings above 80% and to be located in the US for language consistency.",
        "4.3 Processing the Dataset Because of the size of the dataset, hand annotation of all referring expressions is prohibitive.",
