        "The TAC Knowledge Base Population (KBP) Slot Filling (SF) consists of extracting named attributes from text.",
        "Given a query, e.g. John Kerry, a system searches a corpus for documents which contain the entity.",
        "It then fills a list of slots, named attributes such as (per:spouse, Teresa Heinz).",
        "The top TAC SF 2013 (TAC13) system scored 37.3% F-score (Roth et al., 2013), and the median F-score was 16.9% (Surdeanu, 2013).",
        "Recall for SF systems is especially low, with many systems using precise extractors with low recall.",
        "Precision ranges from 9% to 40% greater than recall for the top 5 systems in TAC13, and unsurprisingly, Roth et al. (2013) has the highest recall at 33%.",
        "Closing the recall gap without substantially increasing the search space is critical to improving SF results.",
        "Ji and Grishman (2011) and Min and Grishman (2012) identify many of the challenges of SF, and suggest that inference, coreference and named entity recognition (NER) are key sources of error.",
        "Min and Grishman categorise the slot fills found by human annotators but not found in the aggregated output of all systems.",
        "However, this approach only allows them to hypothesise the likely source of recall loss.",
        "For instance, it is impossible to distinguish candidate generation errors from answer merging errors.",
        "Roth et al. (2014) categorise these errors at a high level, without specific analysis of candidate generation pipeline components such as coreference.",
        "In this paper, we take this analysis further by performing a systematic recall analysis that allows us to pinpoint the cause of every recall error (candidates lost that can never be recovered) and estimate upper bounds on recall in existing approaches.",
        "We implement a collection of na?",
        "?ve SF systems utilizing a set of increasingly restrictive filters over documents and named entities (NEs).",
        "TAC has three slot types: NE, string and value slots.",
        "We consider only those slots filled by NEs as there are widely-used, high accuracy tools available for NER, and focusing on NEs only allows us to precisely gauge performance of filters.",
        "String slots do not have reliable classifiers, and value slots require more normalisation than directly returning a token span.",
        "Otherwise, this evaluation is not specifically dependent on the nature of NEs, and we expect similar results for other slot types.",
        "We focus on systems which first generate candidates and then process them, the approach of the majority of TAC systems.",
        "Our filters apply hard constraints over NEs commonly used in the litera-ture, accounting for a typical SF candidate generation pipeline?matching the query term, the form of candidate fills and the distance between the query and the candidate?but not performing any further scoring or thresholding.",
        "We compare sev-820 eral forms of coreference as filters, motivated by the need for efficient coreference resolution when processing large corpora.",
        "Complementing these unsupervised experiments, we implement a maximum recall bootstrap to identify which fills are reachable from training data.",
        "We find ?10% of recall is ignored by most systems due to NER bounds errors, and despite state-of-the-art coreference, 8% is lost when queries and fills occur in different sentences.",
        "Using NE type constraints is very effective, reducing recall by only 2% for a search space reduction of 81%.",
        "Without any coreference, 16% of typed fills are lost, but 12% of this recall can be recovered using fast na?",
        "?ve name matching rules, reducing the search space to 59% that of full coreference.",
        "15% of recall is lost if a SF approach, such as a boot-strapping, requires that dependency paths be non-unique in a corpus.",
        "We show that most remaining candidates are reachable via bootstrapping from a small number of seeds.",
        "Our results provide systematic confirmation that effective coreference and NER are critical to high recall slot filling.",
        "2 Why focus on recall?",
        "In this work, we determine the recall loss caused by candidate generation constraints in SF systems.",
        "SF pipelines are typically implemented using a coarse-to-fine approach, where all possible candidates are generated and then filtered by hard constraints and more sophisticated downstream processes.",
        "Following this, we maximally generate candidates and assume a high-precision but relatively costly downstream process selects the final extractions.",
        "While ultimately any system makes precision-recall trade-offs, the recall of a system's coarse candidate generation process sets a hard upper bound on performance, as candidates that are not generated at all can never be recovered by downstream processes.",
        "SF systems could generate every noun phrase in a corpus as potential can-didates, but they apply hard candidate generation constraints for efficiency and precision.",
        "We implement these hard constraints as a series of filters, and return every candidate which passes a filter without further ranking or threshold-ing.",
        "These filters are comprised of generic com-ponents, such as NER, which are representative of SF pipelines.",
        "We are only interested in precision in so much as it corresponds to the size of the search space (the candidates generated), assuming a small, fixed number of answers.",
        "The search space determines the workload of later stages responsible for extraction, merging and ranking.",
        "Precision can be improved by this post-processing of the candidate set, but recall cannot.",
        "3 Background Slot filling (SF) is a query-oriented relation extraction (RE) task in the Knowledge Base Population (KBP) track of the Text Analysis Conferences (TAC) (McNamee and Dang, 2009).",
        "A SF system is queried with a name and a predefined relation schema, or slots, and must seek instances of any relations involving the query entity, and the corresponding slot fills, from a corpus.",
        "Systems typically consist of several pipelined stages (Ji et al., 2011), providing many potential locations for error.",
        "The basic pipeline, in Figure 1, consists of four stages (Ji and Grishman, 2011): document retrieval, candidate generation, answer extraction, and answer merging and ranking.",
        "The output of the second stage is a set of candidates which are then usually ranked using RE techniques, 1 to precisely pinpoint answers.",
        "TAC penalises redundant responses, requiring a final answer merging and ranking stage.",
        "The first two stages are the focus of this work, as they inadvertently filter correct answers that cannot be re-covered, and they determine the size of the search space for later stages.",
        "Min and Grishman (2012) conducted an analysis of the 140 TAC 2010 SF fills that were found by human annotators but not any system, and manually look for evidence in the reference document and categorise the hypothetical sources of error.",
        "They find inference, coreference and NER to be the top sources of error, and that the most studied component (sentence-level RE) is not the dominant problem, contributing only 10% of recall loss.",
        "We precisely characterise the contribution of these sources of error.",
        "We follow the SF literature in adopting RE techniques for filtering candidates.",
        "RE focuses on identifying relations between entities (or attributes of entities) as mentioned in text.",
        "Both relation schema and training data are often provided, and extraction is done using learnt classifiers (Mintz et al., 2009; Surdeanu et al., 2012; Riedel et al., 1 We note that question answering techniques have been used directly by SF systems (Byrne and Dunnion, 2011) but RE techniques are the primary method for answer extraction.",
        "821 answer extraction answer merging and ranking document retrieval alias match exact match oracle docs candidate generation NEs sentence filter coref NNP coref NNP naive dependency filters length types non-unique no coref NP n-grams Figure 1: Candidate filters within the standard SF pipeline.",
        "Arrows indicate a sequence of filters.",
        "2013; Zhang et al., 2013) or semi-supervised techniques (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Wang et al., 2011; Carlson et al., 2010).",
        "Relation phrases or patterns may be identified without labels (Fader et al., 2011; Mausam et al., 2012) or clustered (Yao et al., 2012) into types.",
        "Generating candidate entity pairs and using the syntactic or surface path between them to decide whether a relation exists are common threads in RE that also form part of the SF pipeline.",
        "In some RE tasks, entities mentioned may already be identified in a document and provided to a RE sys-tem; in general, automatic NER is required.",
        "Some tasks are defined more generally to include common noun phrases (Fader et al., 2011; Carlson et al., 2010).",
        "SF specifically includes slots that can be filled by arbitrary strings such as per:cause of death, which make up a large number of slot fills but may require the use of different techniques for extraction, separate from names.",
        "NER may be further enhanced by resolving names to a KB (Mintz et al., 2009; Hoffmann et al., 2011; Surdeanu et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2011), reducing noise in learning and extraction processes, but we do not take this step in this work.",
        "Typically, a RE system will only consider entities mentioned together in a sentence.",
        "When seeking all instances of a given relation between known entities, coreference resolution is necessary to substantially expand the set of candidate pairs (Gab- bard et al., 2011).",
        "Coreference resolution may not be necessary where each relation is redundantly mentioned in a large corpus, as in SF; in this vein, ?Open?",
        "approaches prefer precision and avoid automatic coreference resolution (Banko et al., 2007).",
        "Moreover, previous analysis attributed substantial SF error to these tools (Ji and Grish-man, 2011).",
        "Our work evaluates NER, locality heuristics and coreference within a SF context.",
        "Classification features for RE typically encode: attributes of the entities; the surface form, dependency path, or phrase structure subtree between them; and surrounding context (Zhou et al., 2005; Mintz et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2013).",
        "We evaluate the length of dependency path between entities as a variable affecting SF candidate recall, and apply na?",
        "?ve entity pair bootstrapping (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000) to assess the generalisation over dependency paths from examples.",
        "4 Experimental setup We begin with a set of queries (a query being a NE entity grounded in a mention in a document) and, for each query q, the documents D q known to contain any slot fill for q, as determined by oracle information retrieval (IR) from human annotation and judged system output.",
        "Filling every slot in q with every n-gram in D q constitutes a system with nearly perfect recall.",
        "We apply a series of increasingly restrictive filters over this set.",
        "As in Figure 1, SF systems in practice must retrieve relevant documents and generate candidates.",
        "We propose filters that allow for analysis of recall lost during these stages.",
        "We ignore the remaining stages and evaluate the set of candidates directly.",
        "Filters define what documents or NEs are allowed to pass through, based on constraints imposed by query matching, entity form, and sentence and syntactic context.",
        "We combine these filters in series in a number of configurations.",
        "The use or absence of coreference varies across our configurations, as the need to identify the query mention and terms that refer to the query mention is critical.",
        "Finally, we experiment with a boot-822 strapping training process, to reflect constraints implicitly applied by a training approach.",
        "The SF typical system pipeline presented in Section 3 applies to most, but not all SF approaches.",
        "The following filters directly apply only to systems that use NER as the method of candidate gen-eration, and where candidate generation is distinct from answer extraction.",
        "Fourteen of the eighteen teams participating in TAC13 submitted system reports (Surdeanu, 2013).",
        "Eleven of these systems identify NEs with NER and pass these to an answer extraction process.",
        "The remaining three systems either do not document whether they rely on or do not rely on NER for candidate generation for name slots.",
        "We include a high recall baseline based on noun phrases (NPs) to cover these systems.",
        "4.1 Filters The first step in the SF pipeline is to find a relevant document and the query entity mentioned within that document.",
        "We use oracle IR to find documents D q (ORACLE DOCS in Figure 1) but need to find a reference to q in these documents for other filters and downstream stages (ALIAS MATCH in Figure 1).",
        "An exact match to the query name is trivial, but some documents may not contain the query verbatim.",
        "This primarily occurs in cases where an alias is used, e.g. where the query Fyffes PLC is only mentioned as Fyffes in a document.",
        "SF systems typically implement a query expansion step prior to searching for relevant docu-ments, generating and extracting aliases based on the corpus and external sources (Ji et al., 2011).",
        "For documents that do not mention the query ver-batim, we manually annotate the longest token span which refers to the query.",
        "All of our filters are applied to this base setup.",
        "To measure the effect of our manual aliases on recall, we implement a na?",
        "?ve EXACT MATCH filter, which allows a document only if a NE matches the query verbatim.",
        "Entity form filters are based on the form of the entities extracted from documents.",
        "We initially consider all substrings of all NPs for a high-recall, yet tractable, baseline.",
        "The NP N-GRAMS filter allows every n-gram of every NP.",
        "NES allows NEs only; and for TYPES, fill NEs must be of a NER type defined by the slot, e.g. for per:city of birth only LOC NEs are allowed.",
        "Sentence filters require the query mention and fill to be in the same sentence, or to have mentions in the same sentence.",
        "Sentence filters are COREF: the query and the fill must be mentioned in the same sentence; COREF NNP: as for COREF, but the query and the fill must have coreferent proper noun mentions in the same sentence; NA ?",
        "IVE NNP: as for COREF NNP, but instead of using a full coreference system and identifying proper noun mentions, we use a na?",
        "?ve proper noun coreference process; and NOCOREF: the verbatim query and the fill must be named in the same sentence.",
        "As dependency paths are often a key feature for extracting relations, we apply further syntactic filters based on dependency paths between NEs and mentions in sentences.",
        "Where we use dependencies, we use the Stanford collapsed and propagated representation (de Marn-effe and Manning, 2008), e.g. in Alice is an employee of Bob and Charlie the collapsed and propagated dependency path between Alice and Charlie is?nsubj?employee?prep of?.",
        "Syntactic filters roughly capture the complexity of the syntactic configuration between query and filler: LENGTH ?",
        "N requires that the query and fill are separated by a dependency path of at most N arcs, e.g. the above dependency path is two arcs; VERB requires a verb to be present in the dependency path between the query and fill mentions or names; and NON-UNIQUE requires the dependency path between the query and fill to occur more than once in a corpus, modelling a hard constraint on bootstrapping and other learning processes that require a shared dependency context between training and test examples.",
        "4.2 Bootstrapping reachability In addition to the upper bound set by these explicit hard constraints, we want to reflect constraints that are implicitly applied by an extraction process?",
        "are there fills that are never learnable given a set of features and a set of training data?",
        "We extend our evaluation to include a training process in a semi-supervised setting.",
        "We treat this as a bootstrapping task (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000): given training pairs of NEs in text (each pair effectively a query entity and a candidate slot fill, or vice-versa), extract the context of each pair, and find other pairs in the corpus that share that context.",
        "A pair is reachable, and hence learnable, if it can be found by iterating this process.",
        "We continue to evaluate maximum recall and do not apply thresholding or ranking that would typically be utilised in a bootstrapping process.",
        "We simply output all 823 Jim Senn (PER) Center for Global Business (ORG) Herb Gibson (PER) OSHA (ORG) Leslie Walker (PER) Massachusetts Correctional Legal Services (ORG) per:employee_of <-prep_of<-director<-appos<- <-prep_for<-director<-appos<- Figure 2: Bootstrapping.",
        "The rightmost vertex is labelled with per:employee of after two iterations.",
        "possible candidates in order to measure recall loss: as with hard constraints applied by filters, if recall is lost it can never be recovered.",
        "Given a set of training data, we identify if we can reach a test instance by bootstrapping, no matter how remotely it is connected to training instances.",
        "We use lemmatised dependency paths as the context for this process as they are relatively precise and discriminative, compared to other features used for SF.",
        "In order to simplify process-ing, we construct a graph of all pairs and paths in the corpus first, and then bootstrap from training instances over this graph.",
        "Bootstrapping more general features (e.g. bag-of-words) results in the graph becoming too large to process on our computing resources.",
        "The graph is constructed as follows.",
        "Each vertex represents a typed pair of NEs that occur in the same sentence in the TAC KBP Source Data (LDC, 2010), collapsing vertices that have equal names and types into a single vertex.",
        "An edge exists between pairs that are connected at least once by the same dependency path.",
        "The constructed graph is equivalent to the EXACT MATCH + NOCOREF + NON-UNIQUE filter.",
        "Constructing a graph for COREF (which requires many more edges than NOCOREF) was impractical.",
        "Initially, pairs in training data are labelled with their corresponding slots (see Figure 2).",
        "In each bootstrap iteration, the labels of each vertex are added to its neighbouring vertices.",
        "There is no filtering or competition between labels on a vertex, they are all added.",
        "We analyse performance after each iteration, evaluating by mapping the labelled graph back to the equivalent SF queries.",
        "This enables us to determine what fills are recoverable from the bootstrapping process.",
        "5 Evaluation We evaluate our filters on the TAC KBP English Slot Filling 2011 corpus, queries and task specification.",
        "As we aim to determine recall upper bounds and recall loss, we use only the documents D from the TAC KBP Source Data (LDC, 2010) that are known to contain at least one correct slot fill in the TAC KBP 2011 English Slot Filling Assessment Results (LDC, 2011).",
        "We restrict the assessment results and the evaluation process to all slot types that are filled by name content types as opposed to value or string.",
        "We also do not evaluate the per:alt-ernate names or org:alternate names slots, as extraction of fills for these slots typically falls outside the RE task: while X also known as Y or similar may appear in text, X and Y are typically mentioned independently across documents.",
        "There are 100 TAC11 queries, 50 PER and 50 ORG.",
        "There are 535 fills in our reduced evalua-tion, 1,171 correct responses over these fills: 56% of the original evaluation slots.",
        "The distribution of fills per slot is listed in Table 1.",
        "The number of fills per query ranges from 0 (one query has no name fills) to 71, with a median of 17.",
        "D is comprised of 1,351 documents.",
        "The number of documents per query ranges from 0 to 63, with a median of 15.5.",
        "We use TAC 2009 and 2010 results and annotations as training data for bootstrapping, with 4,647 relevant training examples.",
        "We evaluate ignoring case and without requiring a specific source document: nocase and anydoc in SF evaluation.",
        "Note that each slot fill is an equivalence class of responses: e.g. for org:founded by the correct fills Clifford S. Asness and Clifford Asness are equivalent.",
        "Consistent with SF evaluation, we identify at what constraint an entire equivalence class no longer has any member proposed as a fill.",
        "We process documents with Stanford CoreNLP: tokenisation, POS tagging (Toutanova et al., 2003), NER (Finkel et al., 2005), parsing (Klein and Manning, 2003), and coreference resolution (Lee et al., 2011), and these annotations form the relevant components of our filters.",

        "We identify the reasons for loss at this filter.",
        "There are four errors due to the fill not existing verbatim in text, e.g. Pinellas and Pasco counties does not contain Pinellas County verbatim.",
        "Four errors occur where an NP is not correctly identified, which occurs in two different cases: where there is genuine error or where the sentence being parsed is actually a list or other semi-structured data as opposed to an actual sentence.",
        "four errors are where a correct answer has not been annotated as correct, we refer to this as ANNOTATION error below, and one case where an incorrect response has been annotated as correct.",
        "While 97% recall is an excellent starting point, 53M candidates is a huge, likely intractable search space for any downstream process.",
        "Hence NER is commonly used as the starting point for SF.",
        "NEs Most errors here are due to NER errors, and these errors result in nearly a 10% recall loss.",
        "25 errors are caused where no token in the fill has been tagged as part of a NE (NO NER); and 13 where some tokens were missed (NER BOUNDS).",
        "There are two additional cases of ANNOTATION due to determiners not being included in an NE, where they perhaps should have also been annotated.",
        "Hence, in agreement with previous analy-ses, NER error has a large impact on SF.",
        "On this data set we have 10% recall loss that most SF or RE approaches would never be able to extract.",
        "However, it is still fairly unconstrained and a high recall bound in comparison to the following filters.",

        "We note that limiting bootstrap to one or two iterations is ideal for the best trade-off between recall and search space.",
        "However, closer analysis of discriminative paths is required for a full SF system.",
        "Note that even when bootstrapping through every dependency path in the corpus, there is an upper bound on recall of 39%.",
        "Even if we used the test data as additional training data the recall would still be limited to 43%.",
        "This demonstrates that systems need distributional features, dependency tree kernels or other similarity comparison as opposed to exact feature matching if dependency paths are to be a useful feature for SF.",

        "There may be fills that are missed in the evaluation results but are correct and returned by our high recall filters?affecting our reported precisions.",
        "We manually evaluate a small sample of the queries, the first five person and the first five organization queries, to identify missed fills in the COREF output (2,903 of 49,170 total fills, or 5.9%).",
        "For these fills, there were 29 fills in the assessment data.",
        "Of these fills, 21 are returned by COREF, however there are two correct fills found by COREF that are not in the assessment data.",
        "One of these two errors would be identified with correct coreference, and the other requires complex long range inference.",
        "These additional correct fills that are identified will not have a large impact on the absolute precision, as there are two of 2,903 more fills.",
        "However, the relative difference in true positives, 21 to 23, results in some uncertainty in results when comparing them relatively.",
        "8 Conclusion Recent TAC KBP Slot Filling results have shown that state-of-the-art systems are substantially limited by low recall.",
        "In this work, we perform a maximum recall analysis of slot filling, providing a comprehensive analysis of recall error created in the document retrieval and candidate generation stages.",
        "We focus on recall error in candidate generation as a performance limitation, as candidates that are lost in the pipeline cannot be recovered by downstream processes.",
        "We find ?10% of recall is ignored by most slot filling systems due to NER error, and while state-of-the-art coreference provides a substantial recall gain over no coreference, 8% of recall is still lost when queries and fills occur in different sentences.",

        "We find that using maximum recall bootstrap-ping, 39% of test slots fills are reachable from the TAC09 and TAC10 training data, limited by an upper bound on non-unique paths of 43%.",
        "In the future, we intend to assess how specific 828 slots are affected by recall and search space trade-off, and perform evaluation over all slot types: names, values and strings.",
        "In addition, we intend to expand the bootstrapping experiments with variations over the training data.",
