        "One of the first skills a child must develop in the course of language acquisition is the ability to segment speech into words.",
        "Stress has long been recognized as a useful cue for English word seg-mentation, following the observation that words in English are predominantly stress-initial (Cutler and Carter, 1987), together with the result that 9- month-old English-learning infants prefer stress-initial stimuli (Jusczyk et al., 1993).",
        "A range of statistical (Doyle and Levy, 2013; Christiansen et al., 1998; B?orschinger and Johnson, 2014) and rule-based (Yang, 2004; Lignos and Yang, 2010) models have used stress information to improve word segmentation.",
        "However, that work uses stress-marked input prepared by marking vowels that are listed as stressed in a pronouncing dictionary.",
        "This pre-processing step glosses over the fact that stress identification itself involves a non-trival learning problem, since stress has many possible phonetic reflexes and no known invariants (Campbell and Beckman, 1997; Fry, 1955; Fry, 1958).",
        "One known strong correlate of stress in English is syllable weight: heavy syllables, which end in a consonant or have a long vowel, attract stress in English.",
        "We present experiments with Bayesian Adaptor Grammars (Johnson et al., 2007) that suggest syllable weight encodes largely the same information for word segmentation that dictionary stress information does.",
        "Specifically, we modify the Adaptor Grammar word segmentation model of B?orschinger and Johnson (2014) to compare the utility of syllable weight and stress cues for finding word boundaries, both individually and in combination.",
        "We describe how a shortcoming of Adaptor Grammars prevents us from comparing stress and weight cues in combination with the full range of phonotactic cues for word segmentation, and design two experiments to work around this limitation.",
        "The first experiment uses grammars that provide parallel analyses for syllable weight and stress, and learns initial/non-initial phonotactic distinctions.",
        "In this first experiment, syllable weight cues are actually more useful than stress cues at larger input sizes.",
        "The second experiment focuses on incorporating phonotactic cues for typical word-final consonant clusters (such as inflectional morphemes), at the expense of parallel structures.",
        "In this second experiment, weight cues merely match stress cues at larger input sizes, and the learning curve for the combined weight-and-stress grammar follows almost perfectly with the stress-only grammar.",
        "This second experiment suggests that the advantage of weight over stress in the first experiment was purely due to poor modeling of word-final consonant clusters by the stress-only grammar, not weight per se.",
        "All together, these results indicate that syllable weight 844 is highly redundant with dictionary-based stress for the purposes of English word segmentation; in fact, in our experiments, there is no detectable difference between relying on syllable weight and relying on dictionary stress.",
        "2 Background Stress is the perception that some syllables are more prominent than others, and reflects a com-plex, language-specific interaction between acoustic cues (such as loudness and duration), and phonological patterns (such as syllable shapes).",
        "The details on how stress is assigned, produced, and perceived vary greatly across languages.",
        "Three aspects of the English stress system are relevant for this paper.",
        "First, although English stress can shift in different contexts (Liberman and Prince, 1977), such as from the first syllable of ?fourteen?",
        "in isolation to the second syllable when followed by a stressed syllable, it is largely stable across different tokens of a given word.",
        "Second, most words in English end up being stress-initial on a type and token basis.",
        "Third, heavy syllables (those with a long vowel or a consonant coda) attract stress in English.",
        "There is experimental evidence that English-learning infants prefer stress-initial words from around the age of seven months (Jusczyk et al., 1993; Juszcyk et al., 1999; Jusczyk et al., 1993; Thiessen and Saffran, 2003).",
        "A variety of computational models have subsequently been developed that take stress-annotated input and use this regularity to improve segmentation accuracy.",
        "The earliest Simple Recurrent Network (SRN) modeling experiments of Christiansen et al. (1998) and Christiansen and Curtin (1999) found that stress improved word segmentation from about 39% to 43% token f-score (see Evaluation).",
        "Ryt-ting et al. (2010) applied the SRN model to probability distributions over phones obtained from a speech recognition system, and found that the entropy of the probability distribution over phones, as a proxy to local hyperarticulation and hence a stress cue, improved token f-score from about 16% to 23%.",
        "In a deterministic approach using pre-syllabified input, Yang (2004), with follow-ups in Lignos and Yang (2010) and Lignos (2011; 2012), showed that a ?Unique Stress Constraint?",
        "(USC), or assuming each word has at most one stressed syllable, leads to an improvement of about 2.5% boundary f-score.",
        "Among explicitly probabilistic models, Doyle and Levy (2013) incorporated stress into Goldwater et al.'s (2009) Bigram model.",
        "They did this by modifying the base distribution over lexical forms to generate not simply phone strings but a sequence of syllables that may or may not be stressed.",
        "The resulting model can learn that some sequences of syllables (in particular, sequences that start with a stressed syllable) are more likely than others.",
        "However, observed stress improved token f-score by only 1%.",
        "B?orschinger and Johnson (2014) used Adaptor Grammars (Johnson et al., 2007), a generalization of Goldwater et al.'s (2009) Bigram model that will be described shortly, and found a clearer 4-10% advantage in token f-score, depending on the amount of training data.",
        "Together, the experimental and computational results suggest that infants in fact pay attention to stress, and that stress carries useful information for segmenting words in running speech.",
        "How-ever, stress identification is itself a non-trivial task, as stress has many highly variable, context-sensitive, and optional phonetic reflexes.",
        "How-ever, one strong phonological cue in English is syllable weight: heavy syllables attract stress.",
        "Heavy syllables, in turn, are syllables with a coda and/or a long vowel, which, in English, are tense vowels.",
        "Turk et al. (1995) replicated the Jusczyk et al. (1993) finding that English-learning infants prefer stress-initial stimuli (using non-words), and then examined how stress interacted with syllable weight.",
        "They found that syllable weight was not a necessary condition to trigger the preference: infants preferred stress-initial stimuli even if the initial syllable was light.",
        "How-ever, they also found that infants most strongly preferred stimuli whose first syllable was both stressed and heavy: infants preferred stress-initial and heavy-initial stimuli to stress-initial and light-initial stimuli.",
        "This result suggests that infants are sensitive to syllable weight in determining typical stress and rythmic patterns in their language.",
        "2.1 Models We will adopt the Adaptor Grammar framework used by B?orschinger and Johnson (2014) to explore the utility of syllable weight as a cue to word segmentation by way of its covariance with stress.",

        "While a vanilla PCFG can only directly model regularities that are expressed by a single re-write rule, an Adaptor Grammar model caches entire subtrees that are rooted at adapted non-terminals.",
        "Adaptor Grammars can thus learn the internal structure of words, such as syllables, syllable onsets, and syllable rhymes, while still learning entire words as well.",
        "In Adaptor Grammars, parameters are associated with PCFG rules.",
        "While this has been a useful factorization in previous work, it makes it difficult to integrate syllable weight and syllable stress in a linguistically natural way.",
        "A syllable is typically analyzed as having an optional onset followed by a rhyme, with the rhyme rewriting to a nucleus (the vowel) followed by an optional coda, as in Figure 1a.",
        "We expect stress and syllable weight to be useful primarily because initial syllables tend to be different from non-initial syllables.",
        "However, distinguishing final from non-final codas should be useful as well, due to the frequency of suffixes in English, and the importance of edge phenomena in phonology more generally (Brent and Cartwright, 1996).",
        "These principles come into conflict when modeling monosyllabic words.",
        "If we say that a monosyllable is an Initial and Final SyllIF, and has an initial Onset and an initial Rhyme, as in Figure 1b, then we can learn the initial/non-initial generalization about stressed or heavy rhymes at the expense of the generalization about final and non-final codas.",

        "The models in this experiment assume parallel structures for syllable weight and stress, and focus on providing the most direct comparison between syllable weight and stress with a strictly initial/non-initial distinction.",
        "This first experiment shows that observing dictionary stress is better early in learn-ing, but that modeling syllable weight is better later in learning.",
        "However, it is possible that syllable weight was more useful because modeling syllable weight involves modeling the characteristics of codas; the advantage may not have been due to weight per se but due to having learned something about the effects of suffixes on final codas.",
        "Our second experiment focuses on modeling some aspects of final codas at the expense of maintaining a rigid parallelism in the structures for syllable weight and stress.",
        "The models in this experiment split only those symbols that are necessary to bring stress or weight patterns into the expressive power of the model, and focus on comparing richer models of syllable weight and stress that account for inital/internal/final distinctions.",

        "We used the same batch-initialization and table-label resampling to encourage the model to mix.",
        "After gathering the samples, we used them to perform a single minimum Bayes risk decoding of a separate, held-out test set.",
