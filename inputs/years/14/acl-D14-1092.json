        "Unlike English and many other western languages, there are no explicit word boundaries in Chinese sentences.",
        "Therefore, word segmentation is a crucial first step for many Chinese language processing tasks such as syntactic parsing, information retrieval and machine translation.",
        "A great deal of supervised methods have been proposed for Chinese word segmentation.",
        "While successful, they require manually labeled resources and often suffer from issues like poor domain adaptability.",
        "Thus, unsupervised word segmentation methods are still attractive to researchers due to its independence on domain and manually labeled corpora.",
        "Previous unsupervised approaches to word segmentation can be roughly classified into two types.",
        "The first type uses carefully designed goodness measure to identify word candidates.",
        "Popular goodness measures include description length gain (DLG) (Kit and Wilks, 1999), accessor variety (AV) (Feng et al., 2004), boundary entropy (BE) (Jin and Tanaka-Ishii, 2006) and normalized variation of branching entropy (nVBE) (Magistry and Sagot, 2012) etc.",
        "Goodness measure based model is not segmentation model in a very strict meaning and is actually strong in generating word list without supervision.",
        "It inherently lacks capability to deal with ambiguous string, which is one of main sources of segmentation errors and has been extensively explored in supervised Chinese word segmentation.",
        "The second type focuses on designing sophisticated statistical model, usually nonparametric Bayesian models, to find the segmentation with highest posterior probability, given the observed character sequences.",
        "Typical statistical models includes Hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) model (Goldwater et al., 2009), Nested Pitman-Yor process (NPY) model (Mochihashi et al., 2009) etc, which are actually nonparametric language models and therefor can be categorized as word-based model.",
        "Word-based model makes decision on wordhood of a candidate character sequence mainly based on information outside the sequence, namely, the wordhood of character sequences being adjacent to the concerned sequence.",
        "Inspired by the success of character-based model in supervised word segmentation, we propose a Bayesian HMM model for unsupervised Chinese word segmentation.",
        "With the Bayesian HMM model, we formulate the unsupervised segmentation tasks as procedure of tagging positional 854 tags to characters.",
        "Different from word-based model, character-based model like HMM-based model as we propose make decisions on wordhood of a candidate character sequence based on information inside the sequence, namely, ability of characters to form words.",
        "Although the Bayesian HMM model alone does not produce competitive results, it contributes substantially to the joint model as proposed in this paper.",
        "Our joint model takes advantage from three different models: namely, a character-based model (HMM-based), a word-based model (HDP-based) and a goodness measure based model (nVBE model).",
        "The combination of HDP-based model and HMM-based model enables to utilize information of both word-level and character-level.",
        "We also show that using nVBE model as initialization model could further improve the performance to outperform the state-of-the-art systems and leads to improvement in both wordhood judgment and disambiguation ability.",
        "Word segmentation systems are usually evaluated with metrics like precision, recall and F-Score, regardless of supervised or unsupervised.",
        "Following normal practice, we evaluate our model and compare it with state-of-the-art systems using F-Score.",
        "However, we argue that the ability to solve segmentation ambiguities is also important when evaluating different types of unsupervised word segmentation systems.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we will introduce several related systems for unsupervised word segmentation.",
        "Then our joint model is presented in Section 3.",
        "Section 4 shows our experiment results on the benchmark datasets and Section 5 concludes the paper.",
        "2 Related Work Unsupervised Chinese word segmentation has been explored in a number of previous works and by various methods.",
        "Most of these methods can be divided into two categories: goodness measure based methods and nonparametric Bayesian methods.",
        "There have been a plenty of work that is based on a specific goodness measure.",
        "Zhao and Kit (2008) compared several popular unsupervised models within a unified framework.",
        "They tried various types of goodness measures, such as Description Length Gain (DLG) proposed by Kit and Wilks (1999), Accessor Variety (AV) proposed by Feng et al. (2004) and Boundary Entropy (Jin and Tanaka-Ishii, 2006).",
        "A notable goodness-based method is ESA: ?Evaluation, Selection, Adjust-ment?, which is proposed by Wang et al. (2011) for unsupervised Mandarin Chinese word segmentation.",
        "ESA is an iterative model based on a new goodness algorithm that adopts a local maximum strategy and avoids threshold setting.",
        "One disadvantage of ESA is that it needs to iterate the process several times on the corpus to get good performance.",
        "Another disadvantage is the requirement for a manually segmented training corpus to find best value for parameters (they called it proper ex-ponent).",
        "Another notable work is nVBE: Magistry and Sagot (2012) proposed a model based on the Variation of Branching Entropy.",
        "By adding normalization and viterbi decoding, they improve performance over Jin and Tanaka-Ishii (2006) and remove most of the parameters and thresholds from the model.",
        "Nonparametric Bayesian models also achieved state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised word segmentation.",
        "Goldwater et al. (2009) introduced a unigram and a bigram model for unsupervised word segmentation, which are based on Dirichlet process and hierarchical Dirichlet process (Teh et al., 2006) respectively.",
        "The main drawback is that it needs almost 20,000 iterations before the Gibbs sampler converges.",
        "Mochihashi et al. (2009) extended this method by introducing a nested character model and an efficient blocked Gibbs sampler.",
        "Their method is based on what they called nested Pitman-Yor language model.",
        "One disadvantage of goodness measure based methods is that they do not have any disambiguation ability in theory in spite of their competitive performances.",
        "This is because once the goodness measure is given, the decoding algorithm will segment any ambiguous strings into the same word sequences, no matter what their context is.",
        "In contrast, nonparametric Bayesian language models aim to segment character string into a ?reason- able?",
        "sentence according to the posterior probability.",
        "Thus, theoretically, this method should have better ability to solve ambiguities over goodness measure based methods.",
        "3 Joint Model In this section, we will discuss our joint model in detail.",
        "855 3.1 Combining HDP and HMM In supervised Chinese word segmentation lit-erature, word-based approaches and character-based approaches often have complementary advantages (Wang et al., 2010).Since the two types of model try to solve the problem from different perspectives and by utilizing different levels of information (word level and character level).",
        "In unsupervised Chinese word segmentation literature, the HDP-base model can be viewed as a typical word-based method.",
        "And we can also build a character-based unsupervised model by using a hidden Markov model.",
        "We believe that the HDP-based model and the HMM-based model are also complementary with each other, and a combination of them will take advantage of both and thus capture different levels of information.",
        "Now the problem we are facing is how to combine these two models.",
        "To keep the joint model simple and involve as little extra parameters as possible, we combine the two baseline models by just multiplying their probabilities together and then renormalizing it.",
        "Let C = c 1 c 2 ?",
        "?",
        "?",
        "c |C| be a string of characters andW = w 1 w 2 ?",
        "?",
        "?w |W | is the corresponding segmented words sequence.",
        "Then the conditional probability of the segmentation W given the character string C in our joint model is defined as: P J (W |C) = 1 Z(C) P D (W |C)P M (W |C) (1) where P D (W |C) is the probability from the HDP model as given in Equation 6 and P M (W |C) is the probability given by the Bayesian HMM model as given in Equation 2.",
        "Z(C) is a normalization term to make sure that P J (W |C) is a probability distribution.",
        "The combining method is inspired by Hinton (1999), which proved that it is possible to combine many individual expert models by multiplying the probabilities and then renormalizing it.",
        "They called it ?product of experts?.",
        "We can see that combining models in this way does not involve any extra parameters and Gibbs sampling can be easily used for model inference.",
        "3.2 Bayesian HMM The dominant method for supervised Chinese word segmentation is character-based model which was first proposed by Xue (2003).",
        "This method treats word segmentation as a tagging problem, each tag indicates the position of a character within a word.",
        "The most commonly used tag set is {Single, Begin, Middle, End}.",
        "Specifi-cally, S means the character forms a single word, B/E means the character is the begining/ending character of the word, and M means the character is in the middle of the word.",
        "Existing models are trained on manually annotated data in a supervised way based on discriminative models such as Conditional Random Fields (Peng et al., 2004; Tseng et al., 2005).",
        "Supervised character-based methods make full use of character level information and thus have been very successful in the last decade.",
        "However, no unsupervised model has utilized character level information in the way as supervised method does.",
        "We can also build a character-based model for Chinese word segmentation using hidden Markov model(HMM) as formulated in the following equation: P M (W |C) = |C| ?",
        "i=1 P t (t i |t i?1 )P e (c i |t i ) (2) where C and W have the same meaning as before.",
        "P t (t i |t i?1 ) is the transition probability of tag t i given its former tag t i?1 and P e (c i |t i ) is the emission probability of character c i given its tag t i .",
        "This model can be easily trained with Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) on annotated data or with Expectation Maximization (EM) on raw texts.",
        "But using any of this methods will make it difficult to combine it with the HDP-based model.",
        "Instead, we propose a Bayesian HMM for unsupervised word segmentation.",
        "The Bayesian HMM model is defined as follows: t i |t i?1 = t, p t ?",
        "Mult(p t ) c i |t i = t, e t ?",

        "i=0 P D (w i |w i?1 ) (6) where w i is the ith word in W .",
        "This is actually a nonparametric bigram language model.",

        "(8) where t w i denotes the number of tables associated with w i in the Chinese Restaurant Franchise metaphor (Teh et al., 2006), t is the total number of tables and H(w i ) is the base measure of G 0 .",
        "In fact, H(w i ) is the prior distribution over words, so prior knowledge can be injected in this distribution to enhance the performance.",

        "P (c ij ) is the probability of the jth character c ij in word w i , this probability can be estimated from the training data using maximum likelihood estimation.",
        "3.4 Initializing with nVBE Among various goodness measure based models, we choose nVBE (Magistry and Sagot, 2012) to initialize our Gibbs sampler with its segmentation results.",
        "nVBE achieved a relatively high perfo-mance over other goodness measure based methods.",
        "And it's very simple as well as efficient.",
        "Theoretically, the Gibbs sampler may be initialized at random or using any other methods.",
        "Initialization does not make a difference since the Gibbs sampler will eventually converge to the posterior distribution if it iterates as much as possible.",
        "This is an essential attribute of Gibbs sampling.",
        "How-ever, we believe that initializing the Gibbs sampler with the result of nVBE will benefit us in two ways.",
        "On one hand, in consideration of its combination of nonparametric Bayesian method and goodness-based method, it will improve the overall performance as well as solve more segmentation ambiguities with the help of HDP-based model.",
        "On the other hand, it makes the convergence of Gibbs sampling faster.",
        "In practice, random initialization often leads to extremely slow convergence.",
        "3.5 Inference with Gibbs Sampling In our proposed joint model, Gibbs sampling (Casella and George, 1992) can be easily used to identify the highest probability segmentation from among all possibilities.",
        "Following Goldwater et al. (2009), we can repeatedly sample from potential word boundaries.",
