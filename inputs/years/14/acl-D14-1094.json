        "Most studies on statistical Korean word spacing do not utilize the information provided by the input sentence and assume that it was completely concatenated.",
        "This makes the word spacer ignore the correct spaced parts of the input sentence and erroneously alter them.",
        "To overcome such limit, this paper proposes a structural SVM-based Korean word spacing method that can utilize the space information of the input sentence.",
        "The experiment on sentences with 10% spacing errors showed that our method achieved 96.81% F-score, while the basic structural SVM method only achieved 92.53% F-score.",
        "The more the input sentence was correctly spaced, the more accurately our method performed."

        "To utilize the user-given spacing information, a corpus of input sentences and their correctly spaced version is necessary.",
        "Constructing such corpus, however, requires much time and resource.",
        "In this paper, to resolve such issue, we propose a structural SVM-based Korean word spacing model that can utilize the word spacing information given by the user.",
        "We name the proposed model “Balanced Word Spacing Model (BWSM)”.",
        "Our approach trains a basic structural SVM-based Korean word spacing model as in (Lee and Kim, 2013), and tries to obtain the sentence which achieves the maximum score for the basic model while minimally altering the input sentence.",
        "In the following section, we discuss related studies.",
        "In Section 3, the proposed method and its relation to Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition are explained.",
        "The experiment and discussion is presented in Section 4.",
        "Finally, in Section 5, the conclusion and future work for this study is given.",
        "2 Related Work There are two common approaches to Korean word spacing: rule-based approach and statistical approach.",
        "In rule-based approach, it is not easy to construct rules and maintain them.",
        "Further-more, it requires morphological analysis to apply rule-based approach, which slows down the process.",
        "Recent studies, therefore, mostly focus on the statistical approach.",
        "Most statistical approaches use well-spaced raw corpus as training data (e.g. newspaper arti-cles) assuming that they are perfectly spaced.",
        "This is to avoid the expensive job of constructing new training data.",
        "Lee et al. (2007) treated the word spacing task as a sequence labeling problem on the input sentence which is a sequence of syllables.",
        "They proposed a method based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM).",
        "Shim (2011) also considered the word spacing task as a sequence labeling problem and proposed a method using Conditional Random Field (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001), which is a well-known powerful model for sequence labeling tasks.",
        "Automatic word spacing is a task to decide boundaries between words, which is frequently used for correcting spacing errors of text mes-sages, Tweets, or Internet comments before using them in information retrieval applications (Lee and Kim, 2012).",
        "It is also often used in post-processing optical character recognition (OCR) or voice recognition (Lee et al., 2007).",
        "Except for some Asian languages such as Chinese, Japanese and Thai, most languages have explicit word spacing that improves the readability of the text and helps readers better understand the meaning of it.",
        "Korean especially has a tricky word spacing system and users often make mis-takes, which makes automatic word spacing an interesting and essential task.",
        "In order to easily acquire the training data, most studies on statistical Korean word spacing assume that well-spaced raw text (e.g. newspaper articles) is perfectly spaced and use it for training (Lee and Kim, 2012; Lee and Kim, 2013; Lee et al., 2007; Shim, 2011).",
        "This approach, however, cannot observe incorrect spacing since the assumption makes the training data devoid of negative example.",
        "Consequently, word spacers cannot use the spacing information given by the user, and erroneously alter the correctly spaced parts (2013) tried to solve the sequence labeling problem using structural SVM (Tsochantaridis et al., 2004; Joachims et al., 2009; Lee and Jang 2010; Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2011).",
        "The studies above (Lee and Kim, 2013; Lee et al., 2007; Shim, 2011), however, do not take advantage of the spacing information provided by the user, and often erroneously alter the correctly spaced part of the sentence.",
        "Lee et al. (2007) tries to resolve this issue by combining an HMM model with an additional confidence model constructed from another corpus.",
        "Given an input sentence, they first apply the basic HMM model to obtain a candidate sentence.",
        "For every different word spacing between the input sentence and the candidate sentence, they calculate and compare the confidence using the confidence model, and whichever gets the higher confidence is used.",
        "The spacing accuracy was improved from 97.52% to 97.64%1.",
        "This study is similar to (Lee et al., 2007) in that it utilizes the spacing information given by the user.",
        "But unlike (Lee et al., 2007), BWSM uses structural SVM as the basic model and do not require an additional confidence model.",
        "Fur-thermore, while Lee et al. (2007) compares the spacing confidence for each syllable to obtain the final outcome, BWSM considers the whole sentence when altering its spacing, enabling it to achieve higher improvement on performance (from 92.53% F-score to 96.81% F-score).",
        "3 Balanced Word Spacing Model Like previous studies, the proposed model treats the Korean word spacing task as a sequence labeling problem.",
        "The label consists of B and I, which are assigned to each syllable of the sentence.",
        "Assuming that x = <x1, x2, ..., xT> is a sequence of total T syllables of the input sentence and y = <y1, y2, ..., yT> is a sequence of labels for each syllable, an example could be given as follows2: Figure 1: An example of word spacing.",
        "In order to utilize the spacing information provided by the user, we propose a new model, the 1 Accuracy was calculated based on syllables.",
        "2 Slashes are used for distinguishing between syllables.",

        "2.",
        "We assume that it costs α per syllable to change the spacing of the original sentence, in order to keep the original spacing information as much as possible.",

        "Furthermore, the correct label sequence might not be in those N-best se-quences, hence degrading the overall performance.",
        "The second approach is fast since it does not calculate N-best sequences, and unlike the first approach, will always consider the correct label sequence as a candidate.",
