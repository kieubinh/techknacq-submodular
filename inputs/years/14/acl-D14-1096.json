        "Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is a crucial task for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, providing basic information about syntax.",
        "Supervised POS tagging has achieved great success, reaching as high as 95% accuracy for many languages (Petrov et al., 2012).",
        "However, supervised techniques need manually annotated data, and this is either lacking or limited in most resource-poor languages.",
        "Fully unsupervised POS tagging is not yet useful in practice due to low accuracy (Christodoulopoulos et al., 2010).",
        "In this pa-per, we propose a semi-supervised method to narrow the gap between supervised and unsupervised approaches.",
        "We demonstrate that even a small amount of supervised data leads to substantial improvement.",
        "Our method is motivated by the availability of parallel data.",
        "Thanks to the development of multilingual documents from government projects, book translations, multilingual websites, and so forth, parallel data between resource-rich and resource-poor languages is relatively easy to acquire.",
        "This parallel data provides the bridge that permits us to transfer POS information from a resource-rich to a resource-poor language.",
        "Systems that make use of cross-lingual tag projection typically face several issues, including mismatches between the tagsets used for the languages, artifacts from noisy alignments and cross-lingual syntactic divergence.",
        "Our approach compensates for these issues by training on a small amount of annotated data on the target side, demonstrating that only 1k tokens of annotated data is sufficient to improve performance.",
        "We first tag the resource-rich language using a supervised POS tagger.",
        "We then project POS tags from the resource-rich language to the resource-poor language using parallel word alignments.",
        "The projected labels are noisy, and so we use various heuristics to select only ?good?",
        "training examples.",
        "We train the model in two stages.",
        "First, we build a maximum entropy classifier T on the (noisy) projected data.",
        "Next, we train a supervised classifier P on a small amount of annotated data (1,000 tokens) in the target lan-guage, using a minimum divergence technique to incorporate the first model, T .",
        "Compared with the state of the art (T?ackstr?om et al., 2013), we make more-realistic assumptions (e.g. relying on a tiny amount of annotated data rather than a huge crowd-sourced dictionary) and use less parallel data, yet achieve a better overall result.",
        "We achieved 91.3% average accuracy over 8 lan-guages, exceeding T?ackstr?om et al. (2013)'s result of 88.8%.",
        "The test data we employ makes use of mappings from language-specific POS tag inventories to a universal tagset (Petrov et al., 2012).",
        "How-ever, such a mapping might not be available for resource-poor languages.",
        "Therefore, we also pro-886 pose a variant of our method which removes the need for identical tagsets between the projection model T and the correction model P , based on a two-output maximum entropy model over tag pairs.",
        "Evaluating on the resource-poor language Malagasy, we achieved 85.6% accuracy, exceeding the state-of-the-art of 81.2% (Garrette et al., 2013).",
        "2 Background and Related Work There is a wealth of prior work on multilingual POS tagging.",
        "The simplest approach takes advantage of the typological similarities that exist between languages pairs such as Czech and Russian, or Serbian and Croatian.",
        "They build the tagger ?",
        "or estimate part of the tagger ?",
        "on one language and apply it to the other language (Reddy and Sharoff, 2011, Hana et al., 2004).",
        "Yarowsky and Ngai (2001) pioneered the use of parallel data for projecting tag information from a resource-rich language to a resource-poor language.",
        "Duong et al. (2013b) used a similar method on using sentence alignment scores to rank the goodness of sentences.",
        "They trained a seed model from a small part of the data, then applied this model to the rest of the data using self-training with revision.",
        "Das and Petrov (2011) also used parallel data but additionally exploited graph-based label propagation to expand the coverage of labelled tokens.",
        "Each node in the graph represents a trigram in the target language.",
        "Each edge connects two nodes which have similar context.",
        "Originally, only some nodes received a label from direct label projection, and then labels were propagated to the rest of the graph.",
        "They only extracted the dictionary from the graph because the labels of nodes are noisy.",
        "They used the dictionary as the constraints for a feature-based HMM tagger (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010).",
        "Both Duong et al. (2013b) and Das and Petrov (2011) achieved 83.4% accuracy on the test set of 8 European languages.",
        "Goldberg et al. (2008) pointed out that, with the presence of a dictionary, even an incomplete one, a modest POS tagger can be built using simple methods such as expectation maximization.",
        "This is because most of the time, words have a very limited number of possible tags, thus a dictionary that specifies the allowable tags for a word helps to restrict the search space.",
        "With a gold-standard dictionary, Das and Petrov (2011) achieved an accuracy of approximately 94% on the same 8 languages.",
        "The effectiveness of a gold-standard dictionary is undeniable, however it is costly to build one, especially for resource-poor languages.",
        "Li et al. (2012) used the dictionary from Wiktionary, 1 a crowd-sourced dictionary.",
        "They scored 84.8% accuracy on the same 8 languages.",
        "Currently, Wiktionary covers over 170 languages, but the coverage varies substantially between languages and, unsurprisingly, it is poor for resource-poor languages.",
        "Therefore, relying on Wiktionary is not effective for building POS taggers for resource-poor languages.",
        "T?ackstr?om et al. (2013) combined both token information (from direct projected data) and type constraints (from Wiktionary's dictionary) to form the state-of-the-art multilingual tagger.",
        "They built a tag lattice and used these token and type constraints to prune it.",
        "The remaining paths are the training data for a CRF tagger.",
        "They achieved 88.8% accuracy on the same 8 languages.",
        "Table 1 summarises the performance of the above models across all 8 languages.",
        "Note that these methods vary in their reliance on external resources.",
        "Duong et al. (2013b) use the least, i.e. only the Europarl Corpus (Koehn, 2005).",
        "Das and Petrov (2011) additionally use the United Nation Parallel Corpus.",
        "Li et al. (2012) didn't use any parallel text but used Wiktionary instead.",
        "T?ackstr?om et al. (2013) exploited more parallel data than Das and Petrov (2011) and also used a dictionary from Li et al. (2012).",
        "Another approach for resource-poor languages is based on the availability of a small amount of annotated data.",
        "Garrette et al. (2013) built a POS tagger for Kinyarwanda and Malagasy.",
        "They didn't use parallel data but instead exploited four hours of manual annotation to build?4,000 tokens or ?3,000 word-types of annotated data.",
        "These tokens or word-types were used to build a tag dictionary.",
        "They employed label propagation for expanding the coverage of this dictionary in a similar vein to Das and Petrov (2011), but they also used an external dictionary.",
        "They built training examples using the combined dictionary and then trained the tagger on this data.",
        "They achieved 81.9% and 81.2% accuracy for Kinyarwanda and Malagasy respectively.",
        "Note that their usage of an external dictionary compromises their claim of using only 4 hours of annotation.",

        "We argue that with a proper ?guide?, we can take advantage of very limited annotated data.",

        "The language specific tagsets are mapped into the universal tagset.",
        "We will use this annotated data mainly for evaluation.",
        "Table 2 shows the size of annotated data for each language.",
        "The 8 languages we are considering in this experiment are not actually resource-poor languages.",
        "However, running on these 8 languages makes our system comparable with previously proposed methods.",

        "Petrov et al. (2012) provide the mapping from each language-specific tagset to the universal tagset.",
        "The idea of using the universal tagset is of great use in multilingual applications, enabling comparison across languages.",
        "However, the mapping is not always straightforward.",
        "Table 2 shows the size of the annotated data for each language, the number of tags presented in the data, and the list of tags that are not matched.",
        "We can see that only 8 tags are presented in the annotated data for Dan-ish, i.e, 4 tags (DET, PRT, PUNC, and NUM) are missing.",
        "2 Thus, a classifier using all 12 tags will be heavily penalized in the evaluation.",
        "Li et al. (2012) considered this problem and tried to manually modify the Danish mappings.",
        "Moreover, PRT is not really a universal tag since it only appears in 3 out of the 8 languages.",
        "Plank et al. (2014) pointed out that PRT often gets confused with ADP even in English.",
        "We will later show that the mapping problem causes substantial degradation in the performance of a POS tagger exploiting parallel data.",
        "The method we present here is more target-language oriented: our model is trained on the target language, in this way, only relevant information from the source language is retained.",
        "Thus, we automatically correct the map-ping, and other incompatibilities arising from incorrect alignments and syntactic divergence between the source and target languages.",

        "2 Many of these are mistakes in the mapping, however, they are indicative of the kinds of issues expected in low-resource languages.",
        "888 3 Directly Projected Model (DPM) In this section we describe a maximum entropy tagger that only uses information from directly projected data.",
        "3.1 Parallel data We first collect Europarl data having English as the source language, an average of 1.85 million parallel sentences for each of the 8 language pairs.",
        "In terms of parallel data, we use far less data compared with other recent work.",
        "Das and Petrov (2011) used Europarl and the ODS United Nation dataset, while T?ackstr?om et al. (2013) additionally used parallel data crawled from the web.",
        "The amount of parallel data is crucial for alignment quality.",
        "Since DPM uses alignments to transfer tags from source to target language, the performance of DPM (and other models that exploit projection) largely depends on the quantity of parallel data.",

        "3.2 Label projection We use the standard alignment tool Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2003) to word align the parallel data.",
        "We employ the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003) to tag the English side of the parallel data and then project the label to the target side.",
        "It has been confirmed in many studies (T?ackstr?om et al., 2013, Das and Petrov, 2011, Toutanova and John-son, 2008) that directly projected labels are noisy.",
        "Thus we need a method to reduce the noise.",
        "We employ the strategy of Yarowsky and Ngai (2001) of ranking sentences using a their alignment scores from IBM model 3.",
        "Firstly, we want to know how noisy the projected data is.",
        "Thus, we use the test data to build a simple supervised POS tagger using the TnT tagger (Brants, 2000) which employs a second-order Hidden Markov Model (HMM).",
        "We tag the projected data and compare the label from direct projection and from the TnT tagger.",
        "The labels from the TnT Tagger are considered as pseudo-gold labels.",

        "We select the first 200k sentences from Table 3 for this experiment.",
        "This number represents a trade-off between size and accuracy.",
        "More sentences provide more information but at the cost of noisier data.",
        "Duong et al. (2013b) also used sentence alignment scores to rank sentences.",

        "We need a small amount of annotated data for a high performance POS tagger.",
        "For example, we need only around 300 annotated tokens to reach the same accuracy as the state-of-the-art unsupervised POS tagger (88.8%).",
        "Tag dictionary Although, it is not our objective to rely on the dictionary, we are interested in whether the gains from the correction model still persist when the DPM performance is improved.",
        "We attempt to improve DPM, following the method of Li et al. (2012) by building a tag dictionary using Wiktionary.",

        "Clearly, this is beneficial, however, the CRF correction model still performs worse than the MaxEnt correction model (91.3%).",
        "We are not sure why but one reason might be overfitting of the CRF, due to its large feature set and tiny training sample.",
        "Moreover, this CRF approach is orthogonal to T?ackstr?om et al. (2013): we could use their CRF model as the DPM model and train the CRF correction model using the same minimum divergence method, presumably resulting in even higher performance.",
        "6 Two-output model Garrette and Baldridge (2013) also use only a small amount of annotated data, evaluating on two resource-poor languages Kinyarwanda (KIN) and Malagasy (MLG).",
        "As a simple baseline, we trained a maxent supervised classifier on this data, achieving competitive results of 76.4% and 80.0% accuracy compared with their published results of 81.9% and 81.2% for KIN and MLG, respectively.",
        "Note that the Garrette and Baldridge (2013) method is much more complicated than this base-line, and additionally uses an external dictionary.",
        "We want to further improve the accuracy of MLG using parallel data.",
        "Applying the technique from Section 4 will not work directly, due to the tagset mismatch (the Malagasy tagset contains 24 tags) which results in highly different feature sets.",
