        "Grammatical error correction (GEC) refers to the task of detecting and correcting grammatical errors present in a text written by a second language learner.",
        "For example, a GEC system to correct English promises to benefit millions of learners around the world, since it functions as a learning aid by providing instantaneous feedback on ESL writing.",
        "Research in this area has attracted much interest recently, with four shared tasks organized in the past several years: Helping Our Own (HOO) 2011 and 2012 (Dale and Kilgarriff, 2010; Dale et al., 2012), and the CoNLL 2013 and 2014 shared tasks (Ng et al., 2013; Ng et al., 2014).",
        "Each shared task comes with an annotated corpus of learner texts and a benchmark test set, facilitating further research in GEC.",
        "Many approaches have been proposed to detect and correct grammatical errors.",
        "The most dominant approaches are based on classification (a set of classifier modules where each module addresses a specific error type) and statistical machine translation (SMT) (formulated as a translation task from ?bad?",
        "to ?good?",
        "English).",
        "Other approaches combine the classification and SMT ap-proaches, and often have some rule-based components.",
        "Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses.",
        "Since the classification approach is able to focus on each individual error type using a separate classifier, it may perform better on an error type where it can build a custom-made classifier tailored to the error type, such as subject-verb agreement errors.",
        "The drawback of the classification approach is that one classifier must be built for each error type, so a comprehensive GEC system will need to build many classifiers which complicates its design.",
        "Furthermore, the classification approach does not address multiple error types that may interact.",
        "The SMT approach, on the other hand, naturally takes care of interaction among words in a sentence as it attempts to find the best overall corrected sentence.",
        "It usually has a better coverage of different error types.",
        "The drawback of this approach is its reliance on error-annotated learner data, which is expensive to produce.",
        "It is not possible to build a competitive SMT system without a sufficiently large parallel training corpus, consisting of texts written by ESL learners and the corresponding corrected texts.",
        "In this work, we aim to take advantage of both the classification and the SMT approaches.",
        "By combining the outputs of both systems, we hope that the strengths of one approach will offset the weaknesses of the other approach.",
        "We adopt the system combination technique of (Heafield and Lavie, 2010), which starts by creating word-level alignments among multiple outputs.",
        "By performing beam search over these alignments, it tries to find the best corrected sentence that combines parts of multiple system outputs.",
        "The main contributions of this paper are as fol-951 lows: ?",
        "It is the first work that makes use of a system combination strategy to improve grammatical error correction; ?",
        "It gives a detailed description of methods and experimental setup for building component systems using two state-of-the-art ap-proaches; and ?",
        "It provides a detailed analysis of how one approach can benefit from the other approach through system combination.",
        "We evaluate our system combination approach on the CoNLL-2014 shared task.",
        "The approach achieves an F 0.5 score of 39.39%, outperforming the best participating team in the shared task.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 gives the related work.",
        "Section 3 describes the individual systems.",
        "Section 4 explains the system combination method.",
        "Section 5 presents experimental setup and results.",
        "Section 6 provides a discussion and analysis of the results.",
        "Section 7 describes further experiments on system combination.",
        "Finally, Section 8 concludes the paper.",
        "2 Related Work 2.1 Grammatical Error Correction Early research in grammatical error correction focused on a single error type in isolation.",
        "For ex-ample, Knight and Chander (1994) built an article correction system for post-editing machine translation output.",
        "The classification approach has been used to deal with the most common grammatical mistakes made by ESL learners, such as article and preposition errors (Han et al., 2006; Chodorow et al., 2007; Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008; Gamon, 2010; Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2011; Wu and Ng, 2013), and more recently, verb errors (Rozovskaya et al., 2014b).",
        "Statistical classifiers are trained either from learner or non-learner texts.",
        "Features are extracted from the sentence context.",
        "Typically, these are shallow fea-tures, such as surrounding n-grams, part-of-speech (POS) tags, chunks, etc.",
        "Different sets of features are employed depending on the error type addressed.",
        "The statistical machine translation (SMT) approach has gained more interest recently.",
        "Earlier work was done by Brockett et al. (2006), where they used SMT to correct mass noun errors.",
        "The major impediment in using the SMT approach for GEC is the lack of error-annotated learner (?par- allel?)",
        "corpora.",
        "Mizumoto et al. (2011) mined a learner corpus from the social learning platform Lang-8 and built an SMT system for correcting grammatical errors in Japanese.",
        "They further tried their method for English (Mizumoto et al., 2012).",
        "Other approaches combine the advantages of classification and SMT (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012a) and sometimes also include rule-based components.",
        "Note that in the hybrid approaches proposed previously, the output of each component system might be only partially corrected for some subset of error types.",
        "This is different from our system combination approach, where the output of each component system is a complete correction of the input sentence where all error types are dealt with.",
        "State-of-the-art performance is achieved by both the classification (Dahlmeier et al., 2012; Rozovskaya et al., 2013; Rozovskaya et al., 2014a) and the SMT approach (Felice et al., 2014; Junczys-Dowmunt and Grundkiewicz, 2014), which motivates us to attempt system output combination from both approaches.",
        "2.2 System Combination System combination is the task of combining the outputs of multiple systems to produce an output better than each of its individual component systems.",
        "In machine translation (MT), combining multiple MT outputs has been attempted in the Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (Callison-Burch et al., 2009; Bojar et al., 2011).",
        "One of the common approaches in system combination is the confusion network approach (Rosti et al., 2007b).",
        "In this approach, a confusion network is created by aligning the outputs of multiple systems.",
        "The combined output is generated by choosing the output of one single system as the ?backbone?, and aligning the outputs of all other systems to this backbone.",
        "The word order of the combined output will then follow the word order of the backbone.",
        "The alignment step is critical in system combination.",
        "If there is an alignment er-ror, the resulting combined output sentence may be ungrammatical.",
        "Rosti et al. (2007a) evaluated three system combination methods in their work: 952 ?",
        "Sentence level This method looks at the combined N-best list of the systems and selects the best output.",
        "?",
        "Phrase level This method creates new hypotheses using a new phrase translation ta-ble, built according to the phrase alignments of the systems.",
        "?",
        "Word level This method creates a graph by aligning the hypotheses of the systems.",
        "The confidence score of each aligned word is then calculated according to the votes from the hypotheses.",
        "Combining different component sub-systems was attempted by CUUI (Rozovskaya et al., 2014a) and CAMB (Felice et al., 2014) in the CoNLL-2014 shared task.",
        "The CUUI system employs different classifiers to correct various error types and then merges the results.",
        "The CAMB system uses a pipeline of systems to combine the outputs of their rule based system and their SMT system.",
        "The combination methods used in those systems are different from our approach, because they combine individual sub-system components, by piping the output from one sub-system to an-other, whereas we combine the outputs of whole systems.",
        "Moreover, our approach is able to combine the advantages of both the classification and SMT approaches.",
        "In the field of grammatical error correction, our work is novel as it is the first that uses system combination to improve grammatical error correction.",
        "3 The Component Systems We build four individual error correction systems.",
        "Two systems are pipeline systems based on the classification approach, whereas the other two are phrase-based SMT systems.",
        "In this section, we describe how we build each system.",
        "3.1 Pipeline We build two different pipeline systems.",
        "Each system consists of a sequence of classifier-based correction steps.",
        "We use two different sequences of correction steps as shown in Table 1.",
        "As shown by the table, the only difference between the two pipeline systems is that we swap the noun number and the article correction step.",
        "We do this because there is an interaction between noun number and article correction.",
        "Swapping them generates system outputs that are quite different.",
        "Step Pipeline 1 (P1) Pipeline 2 (P2) 1 Spelling Spelling 2 Noun number Article 3 Preposition Preposition 4 Punctuation Punctuation 5 Article Noun number 6 Verb form, SVA Verb form, SVA Table 1: The two pipeline systems.",
        "We model each of the article, preposition, and noun number correction task as a multi-class classification problem.",
        "A separate multi-class confidence weighted classifier (Crammer et al., 2009) is used for correcting each of these error types.",
        "A correction is only made if the difference between the scores of the original class and the proposed class is larger than a threshold tuned on the development set.",
        "The features of the article and preposition classifiers follow the features used by the NUS system from HOO 2012 (Dahlmeier et al., 2012).",
        "For the noun number error type, we use lexical n-grams, ngram counts, dependency rela-tions, noun lemma, and countability features.",
        "For article correction, the classes are the articles a, the, and the null article.",
        "The article an is considered to be the same class as a.",
        "A subsequent post-processing step chooses between a and an based on the following word.",
        "For preposition correction, we choose 36 common English prepositions as used in (Dahlmeier et al., 2012).",
        "We only deal with preposition replacement but not preposition insertion or deletion.",
        "For noun number correction, the classes are singular and plural.",
        "Punctuation, subject-verb agreement (SVA), and verb form errors are corrected using rule-based classifiers.",
        "For SVA errors, we assume that noun number errors have already been corrected by classifiers earlier in the pipeline.",
        "Hence, only the verb is corrected when an SVA error is detected.",
        "For verb form errors, we change a verb into its base form if it is preceded by a modal verb, and we change it into the past participle form if it is preceded by has, have, or had.",
        "The spelling corrector uses Jazzy, an open source Java spell-checker 1 .",
        "We filter the suggestions given by Jazzy using a language model.",

        "More feature functions can be integrated into the log-linear model.",
        "A decoder finds the best correction e?",
        "that maximizes Equation 1 above.",
        "The parallel corpora that we use to train the translation model come from two different sources.",
        "The first corpus is NUCLE (Dahlmeier et al., 2013), containing essays written by students at the National University of Singapore (NUS) which have been manually corrected by English instructors at NUS.",
        "The other corpus is collected from the language exchange social networking website Lang-8.",
        "We develop two versions of SMT sys-tems: one with two phrase tables trained on NUCLE and Lang-8 separately (S1), and the other with a single phrase table trained on the concatenation of NUCLE and Lang-8 data (S2).",
        "Multiple phrase tables are used with alternative decoding paths (Birch et al., 2007).",
        "We add a word-level Levenshtein distance feature in the phrase table used by S2, similar to (Felice et al., 2014; Junczys-Dowmunt and Grundkiewicz, 2014).",
        "This feature is not included in S1.",
        "4 System Combination We use MEMT (Heafield and Lavie, 2010) to combine the outputs of our systems.",
        "MEMT uses METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) to perform alignment of each pair of outputs from the component systems.",
        "The METEOR matcher can identify exact matches, words with identical stems, syn-onyms, and unigram paraphrases.",
        "MEMT uses an approach similar to the confusion network approach in SMT system combination.",
        "The difference is that it performs alignment on the outputs of every pair of component systems, so it does not need to choose a single backbone.",
        "As MEMT does not choose any single system output as its backbone, it can consider the output of each component system in a symmetrical manner.",
        "This increases word order flexibility, as choosing a single hypothesis as the backbone will limit the number of possible word order permutations.",
        "After creating pairwise alignments using ME-TEOR, the alignments form a confusion network.",
        "MEMT will then perform a beam search over this graph to find the one-best hypothesis.",
        "The search is carried out from left to right, one word at a time, creating a partial hypothesis.",
        "During beam search, it can freely switch among the component sys-tems, combining the outputs together into a sentence.",
        "When it adds a word to its hypothesis, all the words aligned to it in the other systems are also marked as ?used?.",
        "If it switches to another input sentence, it has to use the first ?unused?",
        "word in that sentence.",
        "This is done to make sure that every aligned word in the sentences is used.",
        "In some cases, a heuristic could be used to allow skipping over some words (Heafield et al., 2009).",
        "During beam search, MEMT uses a few features to score the hypotheses (both partial hypotheses and full hypotheses): ?",
        "Length The number of tokens in a hypothesis.",
        "It is useful to normalize the impact of sentence length.",
        "?",
        "Language model Log probability from a language model.",
        "It is especially useful in maintaining sentence fluency.",
        "?",
        "Backoff The average n-gram length found in the language model.",
        "?",
        "Match The number of n-gram matches between the outputs of the component systems and the hypothesis, counted for small order n-grams.",
        "The weights of these features are tuned using Z-MERT (Zaidan, 2009) on a development set.",
        "This system combination approach has a few advantages in grammatical error correction.",
        "METEOR not only can match words with exact matches, but also words with identical stems, syn-onyms, and unigram paraphrases.",
        "This means that it can deal with word form, noun number, and verb form corrections that share identical stems, as well 954 Data set # sentences # source tokens NUCLE 57,151 1,161,567 Lang-8 1,114,139 12,945,666 CoNLL-2013 1,381 29,207 CoNLL-2014 1,312 30,144 English Wikipedia 86,992,889 1,778,849,655 Table 2: Statistics of the data sets.",

        "It is worth noting that the pipeline systems only target the seven most common error types, yet still perform well in an all-error-type setting.",
        "In general, the pipeline systems have higher recall but lower precision than the SMT systems.",
        "The pipeline system is also sensitive to the order in which corrections are applied; for example applying noun number corrections before article corrections results in a better score.",
        "This means that there is definitely some interaction between grammatical errors and, for instance, the phrase a houses can be corrected to a house or houses depending on the order of correction.",
        "We noticed that the performance of the SMT system could be improved by using multiple translation models.",
        "This is most likely due to domain differences between the NUCLE and Lang-8 cor-pus, e.g., text genres, writing style, topics, etc.",
        "Note also that the Lang-8 corpus is more than 10 times larger than the NUCLE corpus, so there 956 is some benefit from training and weighting two translation tables separately.",
        "The performance of the pipeline system P1 is comparable to that of the SMT system S1, and likewise the performance of P2 is comparable to that of S2.",
        "The differences between them are not statistically significant, making it appropriate to combine their respective outputs.",
        "Every combined system achieves a better result than its component systems.",
        "In every combina-tion, there is some improvement in precision over the pipeline systems, and some improvement in recall over the SMT systems.",
        "The combination of the better component systems (P1+S1) is also statistically significantly better than the combination of the other component systems (P2+S2).",
        "Combining all four component systems yields an even better result of 39.39% F 0.5 , which is even better than the CoNLL-2014 shared task winner.",
        "This is significant because the individual component systems barely reached the score of the third highest ranking participant before they were combined.",
        "6 Discussion In this section, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the pipeline and SMT systems, and show how system output combination improves performance.",
        "Specifically, we compare P1, S1, and P1+S1, although the discussion also applies to P2, S2, and P2+S2.",
        "Type performance.",
        "We start by computing the recall for each of the 28 error types achieved by each system.",
        "This computation is straightforward as each gold standard edit is also annotated with error type.",
        "On the other hand, precision, as mentioned in the overview paper (Ng et al., 2014), is much harder to compute because systems typically do not categorize their corrections by error type.",
        "Although it may be possible to compute the precision for each error type in the pipeline system (since we know which correction was proposed by which classifier), this is more difficult to do in the SMT and combined system, where we would need to rely on heuristics which are more prone to errors.",
        "As a result, we decided to analyze a sample of 200 sentences by hand for a comparatively more robust comparison.",
        "The results can be seen in Table 4.",
        "We observe that the pipeline system has a higher recall than the SMT system for the following error types: ArtOrDet, Mec, Nn, Prep, SVA, Vform, and Vt. Conversely, the SMT system generally has a higher precision than the pipeline system.",
        "The combined system usually has slightly lower precision than the SMT system, but higher than the pipeline system, and slightly higher recall than the SMT system but lower than the pipeline system.",
        "In some cases however, like for Vform correction, both precision and recall increase.",
        "The combined system can also make use of corrections which are only corrected in one of the systems.",
        "For example, it corrects both Wform and Pform errors, which are only corrected by the SMT system, and SVA errors, which are only corrected by the pipeline system.",
        "Error analysis.",
        "For illustration on how system combination helps, we provide example output from the pipeline system P1, SMT system S1, and the combined system P1+S1 in Table 5.",
        "We illustrate three common scenarios where system combination helps: the first is when P1 performs better than S1, and the combined system chooses the corrections made by P1, the second is the opposite where S1 performs better than P1 and the combined system chooses S1, and the last is when the combined system combines the corrections made by P1 and S1 to produce output better than both P1 and S1.",
        "7 Additional System Combination Experiments We further evaluate our system combination approach by making use of the corrected system outputs of 12 participating teams in the CoNLL-2014 shared task, which are publicly available on the shared task website.",

        "How-ever, the participants?",
        "outputs for this 2013 data are not available.",
        "Therefore, we split the CoNLL-2014 test data into two parts: the first 500 sentences for the development set and the remaining 812 sentences for the test set.",
