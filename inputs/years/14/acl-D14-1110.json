        "Most word representation methods assume each word owns a single vector.",

        "To remedy the issue, Reisinger and Mooney (2010) proposed a multi-prototype vector space model, where the contexts of each word are first clustered into groups, and then each cluster generates a distinct prototype vector for a word by averaging over all context vectors within the cluster.",

        "It is usually difficult for these cluster-based models to determine the number of clusters. Huang et al. (2012) simply cluster word contexts into static K clusters for each word, which is arbitrary and may introduce mistakes.",

        "?",
        "It is also troublesome to find the sense that a word prototype corresponds to; thus, these cluster-based models cannot be directly used to perform word sense disambiguation.",
        "In reality, many large knowledge bases have been constructed with word senses available online, such as WordNet (Miller, 1995) and Wikipedia.",
        "Utilizing these knowledge bases to learn word representation and sense representation is a natural choice.",

        "Before illustrating the three stages of our method in Sections 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4, we briefly introduce our sense inventory, WordNet, in Section 2.1.",
        "Note that, although our experiments will use the WordNet sense inventory, our model is not limited to this particular lexicon.",
        "Other knowledge bases containing word sense distinctions and definitions can also serve as input to our model.",
        "2.1 WordNet WordNet (Miller, 1995) is the most widely used computational lexicon of English where a concept is represented as a synonym set, or synset.",
        "The words in the same synset share a common meaning.",

        "After learning the word vectors using the Skip-gram model, we initialize the sense vectors based on the glosses of senses.",
        "The basic idea of the sense vector initialization is to represent the sense by using the similar words in the gloss.",

        "n i=1 |Sense WN (w i )| possible mapping answers, which are impractical to compute.",
        "Thus, we design two simple algorithms, L2R (left to right) algorithm and S2C (simple to complex) algorithm, for word sense disambiguation based on the sense vectors.",
        "The main difference between L2R and S2C is 1027 the order of words when performing word sense disambiguation.",
        "When given a sentence, the L2R algorithm disambiguates the words from left to right (the natural order of a sentence), whereas the S2C algorithm disambiguates the words with fewer senses first.",
        "The main idea of S2C algorithm is that the words with fewer senses are easier to disambiguate, and the disambiguation result can be helpful to disambiguate the words with more senses.",
        "Both of the algorithms have three steps: Context vector initialization.",

        "Then, for each word in L, we can compute the cosine similarities between the context vector and its sense vectors.",
