        "An emerging subfield of computational linguistics is concerned with learning compositional distributional representations of meaning (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008; Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Coecke et al., 2010; Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011; Clarke, 2012; Socher et al., 2012; Clark, 2013).",
        "The advantage of such representations lies in their potential to combine the benefits of distributional approachs to word meaning (Sch?utze, 1998; Turney and Pantel, 2010) with the more traditional compositional methods from formal semantics (Dowty et al., 1981).",
        "Distributional representations have the properties of robustness, learn-ability from data, ease of handling ambiguity, and the ability to represent gradations of mean-ing; whereas compositional models handle the unbounded nature of natural language, as well as providing established accounts of logical words, quantification, and inference.",
        "One promising approach which attempts to combine elements of compositional and distributional semantics is by Coecke et al. (2010).",
        "The underlying idea is to take the type-driven approach from formal semantics ?",
        "in particular the idea that the meanings of complex grammatical types should be represented as functions ?",
        "and apply it to distributional representations.",
        "Since the mathematics of distributional semantics is provided by linear algebra, a natural set of functions to consider is the set of linear maps.",
        "Coecke et al. recognize that there is a natural correspondence from complex grammatical types to tensors (multi-linear maps), so that the meaning of an ad-jective, for example, is represented by a matrix (a 2nd-order tensor) 1 and the meaning of a transitive verb is represented by a 3rd-order tensor.",
        "Coecke et al. use the grammar of pregroups as the syntactic machinery to construct distributional meaning representations, since both pregroups and vector spaces can be seen as examples of the same abstract structure, which leads to a particularly clean mathematical description of the compositional process.",
        "However, the approach applies more generally, for example to other forms of categorial grammar, such as Combinatory Categorial Grammar (Steedman, 2000; Maillard et al., 2014), and also to phrase-structure grammars in a way that a formal linguist would recognize (Ba- roni et al., 2014).",
        "Clark (2013) provides a description of the tensor-based framework aimed more at computational linguists, relying only on the mathematics of multi-linear algebra rather than the category theory used in Coecke et al. (2010).",
        "Section 2 repeats some of this description.",
        "A major open question associated with the tensor-based semantic framework is how to learn 1 This same insight lies behind the work of Baroni and Zamparelli (2010).",
        "1036 the tensors representing the meanings of words with complex types, such as verbs and adjectives.",
        "The framework is essentially a compositional framework, providing a recipe for how to combine distributional representations, but leaving open what the underlying vector spaces are and how they can be acquired.",
        "One significant challenge is an engineering one: in a wide-coverage grammar, which is able to handle naturally occurring text, there will be a) a large lexicon with many word-category pairs requiring tensor representa-tions; and b) many higher-order tensors with large numbers of parameters which need to be learned.",
        "In this paper we take a first step towards learning such representations, by learning tensors for transitive verbs.",
        "One feature of the tensor-based framework is that it allows the meanings of words and phrases with different basic types, for example nouns and sentences, to live in different vector spaces.",
        "This means that the sentence space is task specific, and must be defined in advance.",
        "For example, to calculate sentence similarity, we would have to learn a vector space where distances between vectors representing the meanings of sentences reflect similarity scores assigned by human annotators.",
        "In this paper we describe an initial investigation into the learning of word meanings with complex syntactic types, together with a simple sentence space.",
        "The space we consider is the ?plausibility space?",
        "described by Clark (2013), together with sentences of the form subject-verb-object.",
        "This space is defined to distinguish semantically plausible sentences (e.g.",
        "Animals eat plants) from implausible ones (e.g.",
        "Animals eat planets).",
        "Plausibility can be either represented as a single continuous variable between 0 and 1, or as a two-dimensional probability distribution over the classes plausible (>) and implausible (?).",
        "Whether we consider a one-or two-dimensional sentence space depends on the architecture of the logistic regression classifier that is used to learn the verb (Section 3).",
        "We begin with this simple plausibility sentence space to determine if, in fact, the tensor-based representation can be learned to a sufficiently useful degree.",
        "Other simple sentence spaces which can perhaps be represented using one or two variables include a ?sentence space?",
        "for the sentiment analysis task (Socher et al., 2013), where one variable represents positive sentiment and the other negative.",
        "We also expect that the insights gained from research on this task can be applied to more complex sentence spaces, for example a semantic similarity space which will require more than two variables.",
        "2 Syntactic Types to Tensors The syntactic type of a transitive verb in English is (S\\NP)/NP (using notation from Steedman (2000)), meaning that a transitive verb is a function which takes an NP argument to the right, an NP argument to the left, and results in a sentence S .",
        "Such categories with slashes are complex cate-gories; S and NP are basic or atomic categories.",
        "Interpreting such categories under the Coecke et al. framework is straightforward.",
        "First, for each atomic category there is a corresponding vector space; in this case the sentence space S and the noun space N. 2 Hence the meaning of a noun or noun phrase, for example people, will be a vector in the noun space: ????",
        "people ?",
        "N. In order to obtain the meaning of a transitive verb, each slash is replaced with a tensor product operator, so that the meaning of eat, for example, is a 3rd-order tensor: eat ?",
        "S?N?N.",
        "Just as in the syntactic case, the meaning of a transitive verb is a function (a multi-linear map) which takes two noun vectors as arguments and returns a sentence vector.",
        "Meanings combine using tensor contraction, which can be thought of as a multi-linear generalisation of matrix multiplication (Grefenstette, 2013).",
        "Consider first the adjective-noun case, for example black cat.",
        "The syntactic type of black is N /N ; hence its meaning is a 2nd-order tensor (matrix): black ?",
        "N?N.",
        "In the syntax, N /N combines with N using the rule of forward application (N /N N ?",
        "N ), which is an instance of function application.",
        "Function application is also used in the tensor-based semantics, which, for a matrix and vector argument, corresponds to matrix multiplication.",
        "Figure 1 shows how the syntactic types combine with a transitive verb, and the corresponding tensor-based semantic types.",
        "Note that, after the verb has combined with its object NP , the type of the verb phrase is S\\NP , with a corresponding meaning tensor (matrix) in S ?N.",
        "This matrix then combines with the subject vector, through 2 In practice, for example using the CCG parser of Clark and Curran (2007), there will be additional atomic categories, such as PP , but not many more.",
        "1037 people eat fish NP (S\\NP)/NP NP N S?N?N N > S\\NP S?N < S S Figure 1: Syntactic reduction and tensor-based semantic types for a transitive verb sentence matrix multiplication, to give a sentence vector.",
        "In practice, using for example the wide-coverage grammar from CCGbank (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2007), there will be many types with more than 3 slashes, with corresponding higher-order tensors.",
        "For example, a common category for a preposition is the follow-ing: ((S\\NP)\\(S\\NP))/NP , which would be assigned to WITH in eat WITH a fork.",
        "(The way to read the syntactic type is as follows: with requires an NP argument to the right ?",
        "a fork in this example ?",
        "and then a verb phrase to the left ?",
        "eat with type S\\NP ?",
        "resulting in a verb phrase S\\NP .)",
        "The corresponding meaning tensor lives in the tensor space S?N?S?N?N, i.e. a 5th-order tensor.",
        "Categories with even more slashes are not uncommon, for example ((N /N )/(N /N ))/((N /N )/(N /N )).",
        "Clearly learning parameters for such tensors is highly challenging, and it is likely that lower dimensional approximations will be required.",
        "3 Methods In this paper we compare five different methods for modelling the type-driven semantic representation of subject-verb-object sentences.",
        "The tensor is a function that encodes the meaning of a verb.",
        "It takes two vectors from the K-dimensional noun space as input, and produces a representation of the sentence in the S-dimensional sentence space.",
        "In this paper, we consider a plausibility space where S is either a single variable or a two-dimensional space over two classes: plausible (>) and implausible (?).",
        "The first method (Tensor) follows Krishnamurthy and Mitchell (2013) by learning a tensor as parameters in a softmax classifier.",

        "In all of these learning-based methods the derivatives were obtained via the chain rule with respect to each set of parameters and gradient descent was performed using the Adagrad algorithm (Duchi et al., 2011).",
        "We also reimplement a distributional method (DMat), which was previously used in SVO experiments with the type-driven framework (Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011).",

        "If we transform the object vector into a K ?K matrix with the noun on the diagonal and zeroes elsewhere, we can combine the verb and object to produce a new S ?K matrix, which is encoding the meaning of the verb phrase.",
        "We can then complete the sentence reduction by multiplying the subject vector with this verb phrase vector to produce an S-dimensional sentence vector.",

        "The break-even point is when the true positive rate is equal to the false positive rate.",
        "In practice it would be more accurate to estimate the cutoff on a validation dataset, but some of the verbs have so few training instances that this was not possible.",
        "4 Experiments In order to examine the quality of learning we run several experiments where we compare the different methods.",
        "In these experiments we consider the DMat method as the baseline.",
        "Some of the experiments employ cross-validation, in particular five repetitions of 2-fold cross validation (5x2cv), which has been shown to be statistically more robust than the traditional 10-fold cross validation (Alpaydin, 1999; Ulas?",

        "The results of 5x2cv experiments can be compared using the regular paired t-test, but the specially designed 5x2cv F-test has been proven to produce fewer statistical errors (Ulas?",

        "F 1 shows how accurately a method assigns the correct class label.",
        "Another way to interpret the results is to consider the AUC as the measure of the quality of the parameters in the verb matrix or tensor, while the F-score indicates how well the softmax, the sigmoid, and the DMat cutoff algorithm are estimating class participation.",
        "Ex-1.",
        "In the first experiment, we compare the different transitive verb representations by running 5x2cv experiments on ten verbs chosen to cover a range of concreteness and frequency values (Sec- tion 4.2).",
        "Ex-2.",
        "In the initial experiments we found that some models had low performance, so we applied the column normalisation technique, which is often used with regression learning to standardise the numerical range of features: ~x := ~x?min(~x) max(~x)?min(~x) (2) This preserves the relative values of features between training samples, while moving the values to the [0,1] range.",

        "The points were randomly sampled from the datasets used in the first experiment.",
        "Finally, the four verbs with the largest datasets were used to examine how the performance of the methods changes as the amount of training data increases.",
