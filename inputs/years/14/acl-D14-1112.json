        "Language relatedness and language change across space and time are two of the main questions of the historical and comparative linguistics (Rama and Borin, 2014).",
        "Many comparative methods have been used to establish relationships between lan-guages, to determine language families and to reconstruct their proto-languages (Durie and Ross, 1996).",
        "If grouping of languages in linguistic families is generally accepted, the relationships between languages belonging to the same family are periodically investigated.",
        "In spite of the fact that linguistic literature abounds in claims of classification of natural languages, the degrees of similarity between languages are far from being certain.",
        "In many situations, the similarity of natural languages is a fairly vague notion, both linguists and non-linguists having intuitions about which languages are more similar to which others.",
        "McMahon and McMahon (2003) and Rama and Borin (2014) note that the computational historical linguistics did not receive much attention until the beginning of the 1990s, and argue for the necessity of development of quantitative and computational methods in this field.",
        "1.1 Related Work According to Campbell (2003), the methods based on comparisons of cognate lists and sound correspondences are the most popular approaches employed for establishing relationships between languages.",
        "Barbanc?on et al. (2013) emphasize the variety of computational methods used in this field, and state that the differences in datasets and approaches cause difficulties in the evaluation of the results regarding the reconstruction of the phylogenetic tree of languages.",
        "Linguistic phylogeny reconstruction proves especially useful in historical and comparative linguistics, as it enables the analysis of language evolution.",
        "Ringe et al. (2002) propose a computational method for evolutionary tree reconstruction based on a ?perfect phylogeny?",
        "algorithm; using a Bayesian phylogeographic ap-proach, Alekseyenko et al. (2012), continuing the work of Atkinson et al. (2005), model the expansion of the Indo-European language family and find support for the hypothesis which places its homeland in Anatolia; Atkinson and Gray (2006) analyze language divergence dates and argue for the usage of computational phylogenetic methods in the question of Indo-European age and origins.",
        "Using modified versions of Swadesh's lists 1 , Dyen et al. (1992) investigate the classification of Indo-European languages by applying a lexicostatistical method.",
        "The similarity of languages is interesting not only for historical and comparative linguistics, but for machine translation and language acquisition as well.",
        "Scannell (2006) and Haji?c et al. (2000) argue for the possibility of obtaining a better translation quality using simple methods for very closely related languages.",
        "Koppel and Ordan (2011) study the impact of the distance between languages on the translation product and conclude that it is directly correlated with the ability to distinguish translations from a given source language from non-translated text.",
        "Some genetically related languages are so similar to each other, that 1 http://www.wordgumbo.com/ie/cmp/iedata.txt 1047 speakers of such languages are able to communicate without prior instruction (Gooskens, 2007).",
        "Gooskens et al. (2008) analyze several phonetic and lexical predictors and their conclusion is that lexical similarity can be seen as a predictor of language intelligibility.",
        "The impact of language similarities in the process of second language acquisition is argued by the contrastive analysis hypoth-esis, which claims that where similarities between the first and the second language occur, the acquisition would be easier compared with the situation in which there were differences between the two languages (Benati and VanPatten, 2011).",
        "1.2 Our Approach Although there are multiple aspects that are relevant in the study of language relatedness, such as the orthographic, phonetic, syntactic and semantic differences, in this paper we focus only on the orthographic similarity.",
        "The orthographic approach relies on the idea that sound changes leave traces in the orthography, and alphabetic character correspondences represent, to a fairly large extent, sound correspondences (Delmestri and Cristianini, 2010).",
        "In this paper we propose an orthographic similarity method focused on etymons (direct sources of the words in a foreign language) and cognates (words in different languages having the same etymology and a common ancestor).",
        "In a broadly accepted sense, the higher the similarity degree between two languages, the closer they are.",
        "One of our motivations is that when people encounter a language for the first time in written form, it is most likely that they can distinguish and individualize words which resemble words from their native language.",
        "These words are probably either inherited from their mother tongue (ety- mons), or have a common ancestor with the words in their language (cognates).",
        "Our first goal is, given a corpus C, to automatically detect etymons and cognates.",
        "In Section 2 we propose a dictionary-based approach to automatically extract related words, and a method for computing the orthographic similarity of natural languages.",
        "Most of the traditional approaches in this field focus either on etymology detection or on cognate identification, most of them reporting results only on small sets of cognate pairs (usually manually determined lists of about 200 cognates, for which the cognate judgments are made by human experts (Rama and Borin, 2014)).",
        "Our approach implies a detailed investigation which accounts not only for the number of related words, as it is usually done in lexicostatistics (where the relationships between languages are determined based on the percentage of related words), but also for their forms, quantifying orthographic similarities.",
        "We employ three string similarity metrics for a finer-grained analysis, as related words in different languages do not have identical forms and their partial similarity implies different degrees of recognition and comprehensibility.",
        "For example, the Romanian word lun?a (moon) is closer to its Latin etymon luna than the word b?atr?an (old) to its etymon veteranus, and the Romanian word v?ant (wind) is closer to its French cognate pair vent than the word castel (castle) to its cognate pair ch?ateau.",
        "In this paper we investigate the orthographic similarity between Romanian and related languages.",
        "Romanian is a Romance language, belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European language family, and is of particular interest regarding its geographic setting.",
        "It is surrounded by Slavic languages and its relationship with the big Romance kernel was difficult.",
        "Besides general typological comparisons that can be made between any two or more languages, Romanian can be studied based on comparisons of genetic and geographical nature, participating in numerous areally-based similarities that define the Balkan convergence area.",
        "Joseph (1999) states that, regarding the genetic relationships, Romanian can be studied in the context of those languages most closely related to it and that the well-studied Romance languages enable comparisons that might not be possible otherwise, within less well-documented families of languages.",
        "The position of Romanian within the Romance family is controversial (McMahon and McMahon, 2003): either marginal or more integrated within the group, depending on the versions of the cognate lists that are used in the analysis.",
        "In Section 3.1 we apply our method on Romanian in different stages of its evolution, running our experiments on high-volume corpora from three historical periods: the period approximately between 1642 and 1743, the second half of 19 th century (1870 - 1889), and the present period.",
        "In Section 3.2 we make use of a fourth corpus, Eu-roparl, with a double goal: on the one hand, to check if degrees of similarity between Romanian 1048 and other languages in the present period are consistent across two different corpora, and on the other hand, to investigate whether there are differences between the overall degrees of similarity obtained for the entire corpus and those obtained in various experiments at sentence level.",
        "The conclusions of our paper are outlined in Section 4.",
        "2 Methodology and Algorithm In this section we introduce a technique for determining the orthographic similarity of languages.",
        "In order to obtain accurate results, we investigate both etymons and cognates.",
        "First, we automatically identify etymons and cognates, then we measure the distances between related words, and finally we compute the overall degrees of similarity between pairs of languages.",
        "We also applied this method for investigating the mutual intelligibility of the Romance languages, and preliminary results are presented in (Ciobanu and Dinu, 2014b).",
        "2.1 Similarity Method Let C \u0010 tw 1 , w 2 , ..., w N words u be a corpus in L 1 and letL 2 be a related language.",
        "We assume, without any loss of generality, that the elements of C are ordered such that C L \u0010 tw 1 , w 2 , ..., w N lingua u is the subset of C containing all the words that have an etymon or a cognate pair in L 2 .",

        "is the empty string and x i is the etymon or cognate pair of w i in L 2 .",
        "Given a string distance ?, we define the distance between L 1 and L 2 (non-metric distance), with frequency support from corpus C, as follows: ?pL 1 , L 2 q \u0010 1\u0001 N lingua N words \u0000 ?",

        "For example, the Romanian word parlament (parliament) has a double etymology: French (with the etymon parlement) and Italian (with the etymon parlamento).",
