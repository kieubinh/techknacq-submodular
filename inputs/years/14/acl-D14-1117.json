        "Abstract",
        "Much recent work focuses on formal interpretation of natural question utterances, with the goal of executing the resulting structured queries on knowledge graphs (KGs) such as Freebase.",
        "Here we address two limitations of this approach when applied to open-domain, entity-oriented Web queries.",
        "First, Web queries are rarely well-formed questions.",
        "They are ?telegraphic?, with missing verbs, prepositions, clauses, case and phrase clues.",
        "Second, the KG is always incomplete, unable to directly answer many queries.",
        "We propose a novel technique to segment a telegraphic query and assign a coarse-grained purpose to each segment: a base entity e 1 , a relation type r, a target entity type t 2 , and contextual words s. The query seeks entity e 2 ?",
        "t 2 where r(e 1 , e 2 ) holds, further evidenced by schema-agnostic words s. Query segmentation is integrated with the KG and an unstructured corpus where mentions of entities have been linked to the KG.",
        "We do not trust the best or any specific query segmentation.",
        "Instead, evidence in favor of candidate e 2 s are aggregated across several segmentations.",
        "Extensive experiments on the ClueWeb corpus and parts of Freebase as our KG, using over a thousand telegraphic queries adapted from TREC, INEX, and Web-Questions, show the efficacy of our approach.",
        "For one benchmark, MAP improves from 0.2?0.29 (competitive base-lines) to 0.42 (our system).",
        "NDCG@10 improves from 0.29?0.36 to 0.54. ?",
        "Work done as Masters student at IIT Bombay 1 Introduction A majority of Web queries mention an entity or type (Lin et al., 2012), as users increasingly explore the Web of objects using Web search.",
        "To better support entity-oriented queries, commercial Web search engines are rapidly building up large catalogs of types, entities and relations, popularly called a ?knowledge graph?",
        "(KG) (Gallagher, 2012).",
        "Despite these advances, robust, Web-scale, open-domain, entity-oriented search faces many challenges.",
        "Here, we focus on two.",
        "1.1 ?Telegraphic?",
        "queries First, the surface utterances of entity-oriented Web queries are dramatically different from TREC-or Watson-style factoid question answering (QA), where questions are grammatically well-formed.",
        "Web queries are usually ?telegraphic?",
        ": they are short, rarely use function words, punctuations or clausal structure, and use relatively flexible word orders.",
        "E.g., the natural utterance ?on the bank of which river is the Hermitage Museum lo-cated?",
        "may be translated to the telegraphic Web query hermitage museum river bank.",
        "Even on well-formed question utterances, 50% of interpretation failures are contributed by parsing or structural matching failures (Kwiatkowski et al., 2013).",
        "Telegraphic utterances will generally be even more challenging.",
        "Consequently, whereas TREC-QA/NLP-style research has focused on parsing and precise interpretation of a well-formed query sentence to a strongly structured (typically graph-oriented) query language (Kasneci et al., 2008; Pound et al., 2012; Yahya et al., 2012; Berant et al., 2013; Kwiatkowski et al., 2013), the Web search and information retrieval (IR) community has focused on telegraphic queries (Guo et al., 2009; Sarkas et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011; Pantel et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2012; Sawant and Chakrabarti, 2013).",
        "In terms of target schema richness, these efforts may 1104 appear more modest.",
        "The act of query ?interpre- tation?",
        "is mainly a segmentation of query tokens by purpose.",
        "In the example above, one may report segments ?Hermitage Museum?",
        "(a located artifact or named entity), and ?river bank?",
        "(the target type).",
        "This is reminiscent of record segmentation in information extraction (IE).",
        "Over well-formed utterances, IE baselines are quite competitive (Yao and Van Durme, 2014).",
        "But here, we are interested exclusively in telegraphic queries.",
        "1.2 Incomplete knowledge graph The second problem is that the KG is always work in progress (Pereira, 2013), and connections found within nodes of the KG, between the KG and the query, or the KG and unstructured text, are often incomplete or erroneous.",
        "E.g., Wikipedia is considered tiny, and Freebase rather small, compared to what is needed to answer all but the ?head?",
        "queries.",
        "Google's Freebase annotations (Gabrilovich et al., 2013) on ClueWeb (ClueWeb09, 2009) number fewer than 15 per page to ensure precision.",
        "Fewer than 2% are to entities in Freebase but not in Wikipedia.",
        "It may also be difficult to harness the KG for answering certain queries.",
        "E.g., answering the query fastest odi century batsman, the intent of which is to find the batsman holding the record for the fastest century in One Day International (ODI) cricket, may be too difficult for most KG-only sys-tems, but may be answered quite effectively by a system that also utilizes evidence from unstructured text.",
        "There is a clear need for a ?pay-as-you-go?",
        "architecture that involves both the corpus and KG.",
        "A query easily served by a curated KG should give accurate results, but it is desirable to have a graceful interpolation supported by the corpus: e.g., if the relation r(e 1 , e 2 ) is not directly evidenced in the KG, but strongly hinted in the corpus, we still want to use this for ranking.",
        "1.3 Our contributions Here, we make progress beyond the above frontier of prior work in the following significant ways.",
        "We present a new architecture for structural interpretation of a telegraphic query into these segments (some may be empty): ?",
        "Mention/s e?",
        "1 of an entity e 1 , ?",
        "Mention r?",
        "of a relation type r, ?",
        "Mention ?",
        "t 2 of a target type t 2 , and ?",
        "Other contextual matching words s (some- times called selectors), with the simultaneous intent of finding and ranking entities e 2 ?",
        "t 2 , such that r(e 1 , e 2 ) is likely to hold, evidenced near the matching words in unstructured text.",
        "Given the short, telegraphic query utterances, we limit our scope to at most one relation mention, unlike the complex mapping of clauses in well-formed questions to twig and join style queries (e.g., ?find an actor whose spouse was an Italian bookwriter?).",
        "On the other hand, we need to deal with the unhelpful input, as well as consolidate the KG with the corpus for ranking candidate e 2 s. Despite the modest specification, our query template is quite expressive, covering a wide range of entity-oriented queries (Yih et al., 2014).",
        "We present a novel discriminative graphical model to capture the entity ranking inference task, with query segmentation as a by-product.",
        "Extensive experiments with over a thousand entity-seeking telegraphic queries using the ClueWeb09 corpus and a subset of Freebase show that we can accurately predict the segmentation and intent of telegraphic relational queries, and simultaneously rank candidate responses with high accuracy.",
        "We also present evidence that the KG and corpus have synergistic salutary effects on accuracy.",
        "?2 explores related work in more detail.",
        "?3 gives some examples fitting our query template, explains why interpreting some of them is nontriv-ial, and sets up notation.",
        "?4 presents our core technical contributions.",
        "?5 presents experiments.",
        "Data can be accessed at http://bit.ly/Spva49 and http://bit.ly/WSpxvr.",
        "2 Related work The NLP/QA community has traditionally assumed that question utterances are grammatically well-formed, from which precise clause structure, ground constants, variables, and connective relations can be inferred via semantic parsing (Kas- neci et al., 2008; Pound et al., 2012; Yahya et al., 2012; Berant et al., 2013; Kwiatkowski et al., 2013) and translated to lambda expressions (Liang, 2013) or SPARQL style queries (Kasneci et al., 2008), with elaborate schema knowledge.",
        "Such approaches are often correlated with the assumption that all usable knowledge has been curated into a KG.",
        "The query is first translated to a structured form and then ?executed?",
        "on the KG.",

        "large corpus may be used to build relation expression models (Yao and Van Durme, 2014), but not as supporting evidence for target entities.",
        "In contrast, the Web and IR community generally assumes a free-form query that is often telegraphic (Guo et al., 2009; Sarkas et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011).",
        "Queries being far more noisy, the goal of structure discovery is more modest, and often takes the form of a segmentation of the query regarded as a token sequence, assigning a broad purpose (Pantel et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2012) to each segment, mapping them probabilistically to a relatively loose schema, and ranking responses in conjunction with segmentations (Sawant and Chakrabarti, 2013).",
        "To maintain quality in the face of noisy input, these approaches often additionally exploit clicks (Li et al., 2011) or a corpus that has been annotated with entity mentions (Cheng and Chang, 2010; Li et al., 2010).",
        "The corpus provides contextual snippets for queries where the KG fails, preventing the systems from falling off the ?struc- ture cliff?",
        "(Pereira, 2013).",
        "Our work advances the capabilities of the latter class of approaches, bringing them closer to the depth of the former, while handling telegraphic queries and retaining the advantage of corpus evidence over and above the KG.",
        "Very recently, (Yao et al., 2014) have concluded that for current bench-marks, deep parsing and shallow information extraction give comparable interpretation accuracy.",
        "The very recent work of (Yih et al., 2014) is similar in spirit to ours, but they do not unify segmentation and answer inference, along with corpus ev-idence, like we do.",
        "3 Notation and examples We use e 1 , r, t 2 , e 2 to represent abstract nodes and edges (MIDs in case of Freebase) from the KG, and e?",

        "We use s and s?",
        "interchangeably.",
        "Generally, there will be enough noise and uncertainty that the search system should try out several of the most promising segmentations as shown in Figure 1.",
        "The accuracy of any specific segmentation is expected to be low in such adversarial settings.",
        "Therefore, support for an answer entity is aggregated over several segmentations.",
        "The expectation is that by considering multiple interpre-tations, the system will choose the entity with best supporting evidence from corpus and knowledge base.",
