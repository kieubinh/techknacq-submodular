        "3) Linguistics analysis.",
        "Researchers in computational linguistics are always interested in investigating the correlation between language and knowledge, to see how the language reflects one's knowledge (Church, 2011).",
        "As we will show in Section 5.4, QDE provides an automatic way to quantitatively measure the knowledge levels of words.",
        "Liu et al. (2013) have done the pioneer work on QDE, by leveraging question-user comparisons extracted from the question answering threads.",
        "Specifically, they assumed that the difficulty level of a question is higher than the expertise level of the asker (i.e. the user who asked the question), but lower than that of the best answerer (i.e. the user who provided the best answer).",
        "A TrueSkill al-2 http://stackoverflow.com/ 3 http://coursera.org/ 1115 gorithm (Herbrich et al., 2006) was further adopted to estimate question difficulty levels as well as user expertise levels from the pairwise comparisons among them.",
        "To our knowledge, it is the only existing work on QDE.",
        "Yang et al. (2008) have proposed a similar idea, but their work focuses on a different task, i.e., estimating difficulty levels of tasks in crowdsourcing contest services.",
        "There are two major drawbacks of previous methods: 1) data sparseness problem and 2) cold-start problem.",
        "By the former, we mean that under the framework of previous work, each question is compared only twice with the users (once with the asker and the other with the best answerer), which might not provide enough information and contaminate the estimation accuracy.",
        "By the latter, we mean that previous work only deals with well-resolved questions which have received the best answers, but cannot handle newly posted questions with no answers received.",
        "In many real-world applications such as question routing and incentive mechanism design, however, it is usually required that the difficulty level of a question is known instantly after it is posted.",

        "Preliminary observations have shown that a question's difficulty level can be indicated by its textual description (Liu et al., 2013).",
        "We take advantage of the observations, and assume that if two questions are close in their textual descriptions, they will also be close in their difficulty levels, i.e., the smoothness assumption.",
        "We employ manifold regularization (Belkin et al., 2006) to characterize the assumption.",
        "Manifold regularization is a well-known technique to preserve local invariance in manifold learning algorithms, i.e., nearby points are likely to have similar embeddings (Belkin and Niyogi, 2001).",

        "textual descriptions.",
        "As the smoothness assumption offers extra information for inferring question difficulty levels, incorporating it will effectively deal with data sparsity.",
        "Finally, we adopt a K-Nearest Neighbor approach (Cover and Hart, 1967) to perform cold-start estimation, again by leveraging the smoothness assumption.",
        "Experiments on two publicly available data sets collected from Stack Overflow show that 1) RCM performs significantly better than existing methods in the QDE task for both well-resolved and cold-start questions.",
        "2) The performance of RCM is insensitive to the particular choice of the term weighting schema (determines how a question's textual description is represented) and the similarity measure (determines how the textual similarity between two questions is measured).",
        "The results demonstrate the advantage of incorporating textual information for QDE.",
        "Qualitative analysis further reveals that RCM might provide an automatic way to quantitatively measure the knowledge levels of words.",

        "In our work, we assume that nearby questions (in terms of textual similarities) will have similar difficulty levels.",
        "Predicting reading difficulty levels of text is also a relevant problem (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004; Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005).",
        "It is a key to automatically finding materials at appreciate reading levels for students, and also helps in personalized web search (Collins-Thompson et al., 2011).",
        "In the task of predicting reading difficulty levels, documents targeting different grade levels are taken as ground truth, which can be easily obtained from the web.",
        "However, there is no naturally annotated data for our QDE task on the web.",
        "Other related problems include query difficulty estimation for search engines (Carmel et al., 2006; Yom-Tov et al., 2005) and question difficulty estimation for automatic question answering systems (Lange et al., 2004).",
        "In these tasks, query/question difficulty is system-oriented and irrelevant with human knowledge, which is a different setting from ours.",
        "7 Conclusion and Future Work In this paper, we have proposed a novel method for estimating question difficulty levels in CQA ser-vices, called Regularized Competition Model (R- CM).",
        "It takes fully advantage of questions?",
        "textual descriptions besides question-user comparisons, and thus can effectively deal with data sparsity and perform more accurate estimation.",
        "A K-Nearest Neighbor approach is further adopted to estimate difficulty levels of cold-start questions.",
        "Experiments on two publicly available data sets show that RCM performs significantly better than existing methods in the estimation task, for both well-resolved and cold-start questions, demonstrating the advantage of incorporating textual information.",
        "It is also observed that RCM might automatically measure the knowledge levels of words.",
        "As future work, we plan to 1) Enhance the efficiency and scalability of RCM.",
        "The complexity analysis in Section 3.2 indicates that storing and processing the graph Laplacian is a bottleneck of RCM.",
        "We would like to investigate how to deal with the bottleneck, e.g., via parallel or distributed computing.",
        "2) Apply RCM to non-technical domains.",
        "For non-technical domains such as the ?news and events?",
        "category of Yahoo!",
        "Answer-s, there might be no strongly distinct notions of ?experts?",
        "and ?non-experts?, and it might be more difficult to distinguish between ?hard questions?",
        "and ?easy questions?.",
        "It is worthy investigating whether RCM still works on such domains.",
