        "Opinion mining (or sentiment analysis) identifies positive or negative opinions in many kinds of texts such as reviews, blogs, and news articles.",
        "It has been exploited in many application areas such as review mining, election analysis, and information extraction.",
        "While most previous research focusses on explicit opinion expressions, recent work addresses a type of opinion inference that arises when opinions are expressed toward events which have positive or negative effects on entities (Deng et al., 2013; Deng and Wiebe, 2014).",
        "We call such events +/-effect events.",
        "2 Deng and Wiebe (2014) show how sentiments toward one 1 WordNet 3.0, http://wordnet.princeton.edu/ 2 While the term goodFor/badFor is used in previous papers (Deng et al., 2013; Deng and Wiebe, 2014; Deng et al., 2014), we have since decided that +/-effect is a better term.",
        "entity may be propagated to other entities via opinion inference rules.",
        "They give the following example: (1) The bill would curb skyrocketing health care costs.",
        "The writer expresses an explicit negative sentiment (by skyrocketing) toward the object (health care costs).",
        "The event, curb, has a negative effect on costs, since they are reduced.",
        "We can reason that the writer is positive toward the event because it has a negative effect on costs, toward which the writer is negative.",
        "From there, we can reason that the writer is positive toward the bill, since it is the agent of the positive event.",
        "Deng and Wiebe (2014) show that such inferences may be exploited to significantly improve explicit sentiment analysis systems.",
        "However, to achieve its results, the system developed by Deng and Wiebe (2014) requires that all instances of +/-effect events in the corpus be manually provided as input.",
        "For the system to be fully automatic, it needs to be able to recognize +/-effect events automatically.",
        "This paper addresses methods for creating lexicons of such events, to support such work on opinion inference.",
        "We have discovered that there is significant sense ambiguity, meaning that words often have mixtures of senses among the classes +effect, -effect, and Null.",
        "Thus, we develop a sense-level rather than word-level lexicon.",
        "One of our goals is to investigate whether the +/-effect property tends to be shared among semantically-related senses, and another is to use a method that applies to all word senses, not just to the senses of words in a given word-level lexicon.",
        "Thus, we build a graph-based model in which each node is a WordNet sense, and edges represent semantic WordNet relations between senses.",
        "In addition, we hypothesized that glosses also contain useful information.",
        "Thus, we develop 1181 a supervised gloss classifier and define a hybrid model which gives the best overall performance.",
        "Finally, because all WordNet verb senses are incorporated into the model, we investigate the ability of the method to identify unlabeled senses that are likely to be +/-effect senses.",
        "We find that by iteratively labeling the top-weighted unlabeled senses and rerunning the model, it may be used as an effective method for guiding annotation efforts.",
        "2 Background There are many varieties of +/-effect events, including creation/destruction (changes in states involving existence), gain/loss (changes in states involving possession), and benefit/injury (Anand and Reschke, 2010; Deng et al., 2013).",
        "The cre-ation, gain, and benefit classes are +effect events.",
        "For example, baking a cake has a positive effect on the cake because it is created; 3 increasing the tax rate has a positive effect on the tax rate; and comforting the child has a positive effect on the child.",
        "The antonymous classes of each are -effect events: destroying the building has a negative effect on the building; demand decreasing has a negative effect on demand; and killing Bill has a negative effect on Bill.",
        "4 While sentiment (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Wilson et al., 2005; Su and Markert, 2009) and connotation lexicons (Feng et al., 2011; Kang et al., 2014) are related, sentiment, connotation, and +/-effects are not the same; a single event may have different sentiment and +/-effect polarities, for example.",
        "Consider the following example: perpetrate: S: (v) perpetrate, commit, pull (perform an act, usually with a negative connota-tion) ?perpetrate a crime?",
        "; ?pull a bank robbery?",
        "This sense of perpetuate has a negative connotation, and is an objective term in SentiWordNet.",
        "However, it has a positive effect on the object, a crime, since performing a crime brings it into existence.",
        "3 Deng et al. (2013) point out that +/-effect objects are not equivalent to benefactive/malefactive semantic roles.",
        "An example they give is She baked a cake for me: a cake is the object of the +effect event baked as just noted, while me is the filler of its benefactive semantic role (Ziga and Kittil, 2010).",
        "4 Their annotation manual, which gives additional cases, is available with the annotated data at http://mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/.",
        "As we mentioned, the +/-effect ambiguity cannot be avoided in a word-level lexicon.",
        "In the +/-effect corpus of Deng et al. (2013), 5 +/-effect events and their agents and objects are annotated at the word level.",
        "In that corpus, 1,411 +/-effect instances are annotated; 196 different +effect words and 286 different -effect words appear in these instances.",
        "Among them, 10 words appear in both +effect and -effect instances, accounting for 9.07% of all annotated instances.",
        "They show that +/-effect events (and the inferences that motivate this work) appear frequently in sentences with explicit sentiment.",
        "Further, all instances of +/-effect words that are not identified as +/-effect events are false hits from the perspective of a recognition system.",
        "The following is an example of a word with senses of different classes: purge: S: (v) purge (oust politically) ?Deng Xiao Ping was purged several times throughout his lifetime?",
        "-effect S: (v) purge (clear of a charge) +effect S: (v) purify, purge, sanctify (make pure or free from sin or guilt) ?he left the monastery purified?",
        "+effect S: (v) purge (rid of impurities) ?purge the water?",
        "; ?purge your mind?",
        "+effect This is part of the WordNet output for the word purge.",
        "In the first sense, the polarity is -effect since it has a negative effect on the object, Deng Xizo Ping.",
        "However, the other cases have positive effect on the object.",
        "Moreover, although a word may not have both +effect and -effect senses, it may have mixtures of ((+effect or -effect) and Null).",
        "A purely word-based approach is blind to these cases.",
        "3 Related Work Lexicons are widely used in sentiment analysis and opinion mining.",
        "Several works such as Hatzi-vassiloglou and McKeown (1997), Turney and Littman (2003), Kim and Hovy (2004), Strappar-ava and Valitutti (2004), and Peng and Park (2011) have tackled automatic lexicon expansion or ac-quistion.",
        "However, in most such work, the lexicons are word-level rather than sense-level.",
        "5 Called the goodFor/badFor corpus in that paper.",
        "1182 For the related (but different) tasks of developing subjectivity, sentiment and connotation lexicons, some do take a sense-level approach.",
        "Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) construct SentiWordNet.",
        "They assume that terms with the same polarity tend to have similar glosses.",
        "So, they first expand a manually selected seed set of senses using WordNet lexical relations such as also-see and direct antonymy and train two clas-sifiers, one for positive and another for negative.",
        "As features, a vectorial representation of glosses is adopted.",
        "These classifiers were applied to all WordNet senses to measure positive, negative, and objective scores.",
        "In extending their work (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2007), the PageRank algorithm is applied to rank senses in terms of how strongly they are positive or negative.",
        "In the graph, each sense is one node, and two nodes are connected when they contain the same words in their WordNet glosses.",
        "Moreover, a random-walk step is adopted to refine the scores in their recent work (Baccianella et al., 2010).",
        "In contrast, our approach uses WordNet relations and graph propagation in addition to gloss classification.",
        "Gyamfi et al. (2009) construct a classifier to label the subjectivity of word senses.",
        "The hierarchical structure and domain information in WordNet are exploited to define features in terms of similarity (using the LCS metric in Resnik (1995)) of target senses and a seed set of senses.",
        "Also, the similarity of glosses in WordNet is considered.",
        "Even though they investigated the hierarchical structure by LCS values, WordNet relations are not exploited directly.",
        "Su and Markert (2009) adopt a semi-supervised mincut method to recognize the subjectivity of word senses.",
        "To construct a graph, each node corresponds to one WordNet sense and is connected to two classification nodes (one for subjectivity and another for objectivity) via a weighted edge that is assigned by a classifier.",
        "For this classifier, WordNet glosses, relations, and monosemous features are considered.",
        "Also, several WordNet relations (e.g., antonymy, similiar-to, direct hypernym, etc.)",
        "are used to connect two nodes.",
        "Although they make use of both WordNet glosses and relations, and gloss information is utilized for a classifier, this classifier is generated only for weighting edges between sense nodes and classification nodes, not for classifying all senses.",
        "Kang et al. (2014) present a unified model that assigns connotation polarities to both words and senses.",
        "They formulate the induction process as collective inference over pairwise-Markov Random Fields, and apply loopy belief propagation for inference.",
        "Their approach relies on selectional preferences of connotative predicates; the polarity of a connotation predicate suggests the polarity of its arguments.",
        "We have not discovered an analogous type of predicate for the problem we address.",
        "Goyal et al. (2010) generate a lexicon of patient polarity verbs (PPVs) that impart positive or negative states on their patients.",

        "4 +/-Effect Word-Level Seed Lexicon and Sense Annotations To create the corpus used in this work, we developed a word-level seed lexicon, and then manually annotated all the senses of the words in that lexicon.",
        "FrameNet 6 is based on a theory of meaning called Frame Semantics.",
        "In FrameNet, a Lexical Unit (LU) is a pairing of a word with a meaning, i.e., it corresponds to a sense in WordNet.",
        "Each LU of a polysemous word belongs to a different semantic frame, which is a description of a type of event, relation, or entity and, where appropri-ate, its participants.",
        "For instance, in the Creating frame, the definition is that a Cause leads to the formation of a Created entity.",
        "It has a positive effect on the object, Created entity.",
        "This frame contains about 10 LUs such as assemble, create, yield, and so on.",
        "FrameNet consists of about 1,000 semantic frames and about 10,000 LUs.",
        "FrameNet is a useful resource to select +/-effect words since each semantic frame covers multiple LUs.",
        "We believe that using FrameNet to find +/-effect words is easier than finding +/-effect words without any information since words may 6 FrameNet, https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/ 1183 be filtered by semantic frames.",
        "To select +/-effect words, an annotator (who is not a co-author) first identified promising frames as +/-effect and extracted all LUs from them.",
        "Then, he went through them and picked out the LUs which he judged to be +effect or -effect.",
        "In total, 736 +effect LUs and 601 -effect LUs were selected from 463 semantic frames.",
        "While Deng et al. (2013) and Deng and Wiebe (2014) specifically focus on events affecting objects (i.e., themes), we do not want to limit the lexicon to only that case.",
        "Sometimes, events have positive or negative effects on agents or other entities as well.",
        "Thus, in this paper, we consider a sense to be +effect (-effect) if it has +effect (-effect) on an entity, which may be the agent, the theme, or some other entity.",
        "In a previous paper (Choi et al., 2014), we conducted a study of the sense-level +/-effect property.",
        "For the evaluation, two annotators (who are co-authors of that paper) independently annotated senses of selected words, where some are from pure +effect (-effect) words (i.e., all senses of the words are classified into the same class) and some are from mixed words (i.e., the words have both +effect and -effect senses).",

        "For a seed set and an evaluation set in this pa-per, we need annotated sense-level +/-effect data.",
        "Mappings between FrameNet and WordNet are not perfect.",
        "Thus, we opted to manually annotate the senses of the words in the word-level lexicon.",
        "We first extracted all words from 736 +effect LUs and 601 -effect LUs; this extracts 606 +effect words and 537 -effect words (the number of words is smaller than the number of LUs because one word can have more than one LU).",
        "Among them, 14 words (e.g., crush, order, etc.)",
        "are in both the +effect word set and the -effect word set.",
        "That is, these words have both +effect and -effect meanings.",
        "Recall that this annotator was focusing on frames, not on words he did not look at all the senses of all the words.",
        "As we will see just below, when all the senses of all the words are annotated, a much higher percentage of the words have both +effect and -effect senses.",
        "We will also see that many of the senses are revealed to be Null, showing that +effect vs. Null and -effect vs. Null ambiguities are quite prevalent.",
        "A different annotator (a co-author) then went through all senses of all the words from the previous step and manually annotated each sense as to whether it is +effect, -effect, or Null.",
        "Note that this annotator participated in an agreement study with positive results in Choi et al. (2014).",
        "For the experiments in this paper, we divided this annotated data into two equal-sized sets.",
        "One is a fixed test set that is used to evaluate both the graph model and the gloss classifier.",
        "The other set is used as a seed set by the graph model, and as a training set by the gloss classifer.",

        "5 Graph-based Semi-Supervised Learning for WordNet Relations WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) is organized by semantic relations such as hypernymy, troponymy, grouping, and so on.",
        "These semantic relations can be used to build a network.",
        "Since the most frequently encoded relation is the super-subordinate relation, most verb senses are arranged into hi-erarchies; verb senses towards the bottom of the graph express increasingly specific manner.",
        "Thus, by following this hierarchical information, we hypothesized that +/-effect polarity tends to propagate.",
        "We use a graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL) method to carry out the label propagation.",
        "5.1 Graph Formulation We formulate a graph for semi-supervised learning as follows.",
        "Let G = {X,E,W} be the undirected graph in which X is the set of nodes, E is the set 7 As mentioned in the introduction, we want our method to be able to identify unlabeled senses that are likely to be +/-effect senses (see Section 8); we resize the Null class to support this goal.",
        "1184 of edges, and W represents the edge weights (i.e., the weight of edge E ij is W ij ).",
        "The weight matrix is a non-negative matrix.",
        "Each data point in X = {x 1 , ... ,x n } is one sense.",
        "The labeled data of X is represented as X L = {x 1 , ... ,x l } and the unlabeled data is represented as X U = {x l+1 , ... ,x n }).",
        "The labeled data X L is associated with labels Y L = {y 1 , ... ,y l }, where y i ?",
        "{1, ..., c} (c is the number of classes).",
        "As is typical in such settings, l n: n is 13,767, i.e., the number of verb senses in WordNet.",
        "Seed/TrainSet in Table 1 is the labeled data.",
        "To connect two nodes, WordNet relations are utilized.",
        "We first connect nodes by the hierarchical relations.",
        "Since hypernym relations represent more general senses and troponym relations represent more specific verb senses, we hypothesized that hypernyms or troponyms of a verb sense tends to have its same polarity.",
        "Verb groups relations that represent verb senses having a similar meaning are also promising.",
        "Even though verb-group coverage is not large, its relations are reliable since they are manually grouped.",
        "The entailment relation is defined as the verb Y is entailed by X if you must be doing Y by doing X .",
        "Since pairs connected by this relation are co-extensive, we can assume that both are the same type of event.",
        "The synonym relation is not used because it is already defined in senses (i.e., each node in the graph is a synset), and the antonym relation is also not applied since the weight matrix should be non-negative.",
        "The weight value of all edges is 1.0.",
        "5.2 Label Propagation Given a constructed graph, the label inference (or prediction) task is to propagate the seed labels to the unlabeled nodes.",
        "One of the classic GSSL label propagation methods is the local and global consistency (LGC) method suggested by Zhou et al. (2004).",
        "The LGC method is a graph transduction algorithm which is sufficiently smooth with respect to the intrinsic structure revealed by known labeled and unlabeled data.",
        "The cost function typically involves a tradeoff between the smoothness of the predicted labels over the entire graph and the accuracy of the predicted labels in fitting the given labeled nodes X L .",
        "LGC fits in a univariate regularization framework, where the output matrix is treated as the only variable in optimization, and the optimal solutions can be easily obtained by solving a linear system.",
        "Thus, we adopt the LGC method in this paper.",

        "This means that the added feature is rather harmful to -effect.",
