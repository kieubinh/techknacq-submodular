        "Online reviews have become an important source of information for consumers.",
        "People tend to read reviews to help them compare products, and make informed decisions.",
        "As the volume of product reviews continues to grow, it is often impossible to read all of them, which calls for efficient methods for opinion mining.",
        "Nowadays, for each product, many websites aggregate the overall rating of re-views, and display its distribution.",
        "However, this cannot provide detailed information.",
        "For exam-ple, two products may have similar overall rating distributions, while people talk about different unsatisfactory aspects.",
        "This problem has inspired a new line of research on aspect-level opinion min-ing(Hu and Liu, 2004).",
        "An aspect refers to a rateable feature, such as staff and location in hotel reviews, or size and battery for digital camera reviews.",
        "In this paper, we deal with the problem of product aspect rating prediction.",
        "The input is a collection of prod-ucts, and each product is associated with a set of reviews.",
        "The goal is to extract the corpus-level as-pects, and predict the aspect ratings for each product.",
        "This kind of fine-grained sentiment analysis will help users efficiently digest the reviews, and gain more insight into the product quality.",
        "The product aspect rating prediction problem usually involves two subtasks: aspect extraction and sentiment identification(Titov and McDonald, 2008b).",
        "Given some text, we would like to know what aspects it talks about, and what kind of sentiments are expressed.",
        "For example, given a sentence ?the room is filthy?, we would like to know that it talks about the aspect ?room?.",
        "Also, ?filthy?",
        "is a sentiment word, and it expresses strongly negative sentiment towards the aspect ?room?.",
        "Topic models(Blei et al., 2003; Hofmann, 1999) have been popular in aspect-based opinion min-ing(Liu, 2012).",
        "Existing works have used topic models to extract only aspects(Titov and McDon-ald, 2008a; Brody and Elhadad, 2010; Chen et al., 2013), or jointly model aspects and sentiments (Mei et al., 2007; Lin and He, 2009; Li et al., 2010; Jo and Oh, 2011; Moghaddam and Ester, 2011; Lakkaraju et al., 2011; Sauper et al., 2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012; Lazaridou et al., 2013; Moghaddam and Ester, 2013; Kim et al., 2013).",
        "In the joint modelling approaches, a sentiment topic is usually modelled as a sentiment label-word dis-tribution, analogous to the topic-word distribution in standard topic models.",
        "However, the difference is that the sentiment topics need to be ordered.",
        "If the model is to be applied for aspect rating predic-tion, the sentiment topics should have clear cor-1192 respondence to the ratings.",
        "Suppose there are 5 sentiment topics with sentiment labels from 1 to 5.",
        "The sentiment topic with label i is expected to correspond to the rating i on the 1-5 rating scale.",
        "For example, the sentiment topic with label 5 should have high probability over positive sentiment words, so it expresses highly positive sen-timent, which matches our natural interpretation for the rating 5.",
        "In this case, sentiment labels and ratings are aligned.",
        "However, in a standard topic model, the learned sentiment topics may not have clear correspondence with different ratings.",
        "Also, if the positive reviews are dominant in the data, the topic model may fail to capture the negative sentiments with any sentiment topic, so no sentiment labels are matched with low ratings.",
        "If the sentiment labels are not correctly aligned to the ratings, we cannot use these sentiment labels to predict aspect ratings.",
        "Consequently, the aspect rating prediction accuracy is compromised, and the method is less practical.",
        "We call this the sentiment label alignment problem.",
        "To tackle this problem, models in the literature usually use some seed words for each sentiment topic to define Dirichlet priors with asymmetric concentration parameter vectors (Sauper et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2013), or use seed words to initialize word assignment to sentiment topic(Lin and He, 2009), or both(Li et al., 2010; Jo and Oh, 2011).",
        "However, these seed words are usually arbitrarily selected, and how to define asymmetric priors is not clear, especially when we would like to capture more than two (positive and negative) kinds of sentiments.",
        "In this paper, we propose a sentiment-aligned topic model(SATM) for product aspect rating pre-diction, which focuses the sentiment label alignment problem.",
        "We use two kinds of external knowledge: the product overall rating distribution, and a sentiment lexicon.",
        "For each product, the overall rating distribution is available on most online review websites.",
        "It provides the big picture of the product-level sentiments.",
        "In SATM, for each product and each aspect, we define a multinomial distribution over sentiment labels, with prior parameterized by the overall rating distribution.",
        "Sentiment lexicon is constructed by linguistic experts, and every word in the lexicon is associated with a sentiment polarity score(Taboada et al., 2011).",
        "We treat the polarity score as an extra word feature in a semi-supervised framework.",
        "By incorporating both product-level and word-level knowledge into the model, the sentiment labels can be aligned with ratings, and the extracted sentiment topics can capture different kinds of sentiments, ranging from highly positive to highly negative.",
        "Experiments on a TripAdvisor dataset demonstrate that our method can effectively deal with the sentiment label alignment problem, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of product aspect rating prediction accuracy.",
        "2 Related work Several methods have been proposed for product aspect rating prediction, and many of them are based on topic models.",
        "In (Lu et al., 2009), the authors studied the problem of generating an aspect rating summary for short comments.",
        "The text was first preprocessed into phrases of the format <headterm, sentiment word>, and the headterms are clustered by Structured PLSA to find K major aspects.",
        "Then, phrase ratings are predicted by either Local Prediction or Global Prediction, and they are aggregated to get aspect ratings.",
        "The method in (Brody and El-hadad, 2010) also first uses topic models to find aspects.",
        "Then, for each aspect, it extracts all the relevant adjectives, and builds a conjunction graph.",
        "A label propagation algorithm(Zhu and Ghahra-mani, 2002) is used on the graph to learn the sentiment polarity score of adjective words.",
        "Although this approach is not proposed for aspect rating pre-diction, it can be used for this task if the polarity scores of adjective words are aggregated for each aspect.",
        "All the methods above perform aspect extraction and sentiment identification sepa-rately, while our approach takes a joint modelling approach so that different subtasks can potentially reinforce with each other.",
        "To demonstrate this, we use these methods as baselines in our experiments.",
        "Wang et al. worked on the Latent Aspect Rating Analysis problem(Wang et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011), the task of inferring aspect ratings for each review and the relative weights reviewers have placed on each aspect.",
        "In (Wang et al., 2010), aspect keywords are provided as user input, and a two-stage method, called Latent Rating Re-gression(LRR), is proposed.",
        "The first stage uses a bootstrapping algorithm to obtain more related words for each aspect, and segments the document content.",
        "In the second stage, the overall rating is ?generated?",
        "as weighted combination of the latent aspect ratings, and LRR is used to infer both the 1193 weights and aspect ratings.",
        "Their follow-up work (Wang et al., 2011) does not need keyword specification from users, and replaces the bootstrapping method with a topic model.",
        "However, both methods implicitly require that each review talks about all aspects, which is not always true due to the data sparsity in online reviews.",
        "In (Moghaddam and Ester, 2011), ILDA was proposed for product aspect rating prediction.",
        "Later, it was extended to FLDA (Moghaddam and Ester, 2013) to address the cold start prob-lem, when there are few reviews associated with a product.",
        "Similar to (Lu et al., 2009), in ILDA and FLDA, a preprocessing step parses the text into phrases of the format <headterm, sentiment word>, and a review is modelled as a bag of phrases.",
        "We also adopt this assumption in our model.",
        "The method in (Sauper et al., 2011; Sauper and Barzilay, 2013) does not use phrases, but instead uses ?snippets?, and an snippet is a short sentence or phrase.",
        "However, the sentiment label alignment problem is not well addressed in these models, which limits their practicality.",
        "ILDA and FLDA did not deal with this problem.",
        "The model in (Sauper et al., 2011; Sauper and Barzi-lay, 2013) follows the most common approach of using seed words to define asymmetric priors.",
        "It supports only two kinds of sentiment topics: positive and negative, while how to define asymmetric priors for more sentiment topics becomes unclear.",
        "More importantly, the prior approach may not work well in practice(see Experiment Section).",
        "Lakkaraju et al. try to tackle the sentiment label alignment problem by assuming that the overall rating is generated as response variable(Lakkaraju et al., 2011), with the sentiment topic proportions as features.",
        "However, how the sentiment labels are related to ratings is still unknown until learned, and we may not get the desired alignment.",
        "Lazaridou et al. attempt to connect sentiment labels with ratings by Kronecker symbol, but this method only applies to three sentiment polarities: ?1(negative), 0(neutral), +1(positive), and it does not explore the word-level lexicon, which is also an important source of knowledge.",
        "Another line of research on product aspect rating prediction or summarization does not use topic models, but relies mainly on word frequency and grammatical relations(Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Blair-goldensohn et al., 2008), or specialized review selection(Long et al., 2014).",
        "In this case, the extracted aspect words need to be clustered manually.",
        "For example, picture and photo may refer to the same aspect in digital camera reviews.",
        "By comparison, topic modelling approaches extract aspect words and cluster them simultaneously.",
        "Our method incorporates the product overall rating distributions and sentiment lexicons into the model, so it is also related to topic models which use observed features or domain knowl-edge(Mimno and McCallum, 2008; Andrzejewski et al., 2009; Andrzejewski et al., 2011).",
        "Mimno et al. introduces two general frameworks to integrate observed features into the generative process: downstream and upstream topic models(Mimno and McCallum, 2008).",
        "In the context of aspect-based opinion mining, MaxEnt-LDA(Zhao et al., 2010) integrates a discriminative maximum entropy component to help separate aspect words and sentiment words.",
        "The SAS model (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012) uses seed words to provide guidance for aspect discovery, and MC-LDA (Chen et al., 2013) uses must-links and cannot-links to extract coherent aspects.",
        "However, MaxEnt-LDA, SAS and MC-LDA cannot be used for aspect rating prediction, since they fail to identify the sentiment polarity of sentiment words.",
        "3 Method 3.1 Preliminaries We first introduce several key concepts used in our model.",

        ". }",
        "be a set of products.",

        ".",
        ".",
        "d N i }, and also an overall rating distribution Y i .",
        "Y i is a multinomial distribution on R ratings.",
        "It is available on most online review websites, and usually R = 5.",
        "Aspects: An aspect is a rateable feature of a product, and each aspect is modelled as a distribution over aspect words.",
        "The number of aspects is predefined as K. Sentiment topics: A sentiment topic is modelled as a distribution over sentiment words, and each sentiment topic is associated with a sentiment label.",
        "To make it consistent with commonly used rating scale, we assume there are R sentiment la-bels, corresponding to the R ratings.",
        "The challenge is that sentiment labels with higher values are expected to be associated with sentiment topics which express more positive sentiments, so that 1194 we can match sentiment labels with ratings.",
        "Phrases: An opinion phrase f =< h,m > is a pair of aspect word h and sentiment word m, such as < room, filthy >(Lu et al., 2009; Moghaddam and Ester, 2011).",
        "For each product P i , we first parse the related reviews D i into phrases F i , and each product can be modelled as a bag of phrases.",
        "Sentiment lexicons : A sentiment lexicon L is a list of sentiment words, and each word m ?",
        "L is associated with a sentiment polarity score s m .",
        "s m can take T values.",
        "Note that the lexicon L usually only covers a small subset of sentiment words in the whole vocabulary.",
        "Sentiment association: The sentiment label takesR values, and there are T different values for the polarity score in the sentiment lexicon.",
        "How-ever, the relation between sentiment labels and polarity scores are unknown.",
        "If we have training instances where a sentiment word m is associated with both a sentiment label r m and polarity score s m , we can build a classifier, where the explanatory variable for the classifier is a sentiment label, and outcome is the polarity score.",
        "In this case, H(s m |r m ) can be interpreted as the probability of observing a polarity score s m , given its sentiment label r m .",
        "We refer to this probability H as sentiment association.",
        "This is a key component in our model.",
        "It naturally bridges the gap between sentiment labels and polarity scores, and captures the uncertainty in their relations.",
        "Note that H can be trained independent of the topic model part.",
        "For each training instance, suppose the sentiment word is m ?",
        "L, we need to know its sentiment label r m and polarity score s m .",
        "s m can be retrieved directly from the sentiment lexicon, and r m can be either manually or automatically annotated.",
        "For example, suppose the word m appears in review d, we can assign the overall rating of d as its sentiment label.",
        "In this case, each word m ?",
        "L can be associated with multiple training instances that have the same value for s m but different sentiment labels r m .",
        "We adopt this approach to automatically annotate sentiment labels, and details are described in the Experiments section.",
        "3.2 Problem definition The product aspect rating prediction problem can be defined as follows.",
        "The input is a set of products P .",
        "Each product P i has a bag of phrases F i , and an overall rating distribution Y i over R rat-Figure 1: Graphical model of SATM ings.",
        "The output is the K corpus-level aspects, and for each product, we predict its ratings on the K aspects, also in the [1, R] rating scale.",
        "We assume products in P are in the same category so they share the same aspects.",
        "3.3 The SATM model We introduce the Sentiment-aligned Topic Model(SATM) in this section, and its graphical representation is shown in Figure 1.",
        "Note that the sentiment association H is observed, because it is trained independently of the topic model part.",
        "At the word level, each observed phrase < h,m > is associated with two latent variables: aspect z and sentiment label r. Aspect z models what aspect this phrase talks about, and r determines the sentiment of m. If m is in the sentiment lexicon, we assume r is also responsible for generating a word feature v m , based on the sentiment association H , which is equal to its polarity score s m in the lexicon.",
        "In this case, the observed data becomes (< h,m >, v m ), and the latent sentiment label r is responsible for generating both word m, and word feature v m .",
        "For example, for the phrase<room, filthy>, we observe a word feature v = ?5, since the sentiment polarity score for the word ?filthy?",
        "is?5.",
        "GivenH , sentiment labels 1 or 2 are more likely to generate a word feature ?5.",
        "Also, people tend to use ?filthy?",
        "to express low ratings, like 1 or 2, so the sentiment labels and ratings can be aligned.",
        "At the product level, for each product p and each aspect k, we define a multinomial distribution ?",
        "p,k overR sentiment labels.",
        "Since Y p already gives us the big picture about the overall senti-1195 ment expressed on this product, we assume ?",
        "p,k is drawn from a dirichlet distribution Dir(pip,k) with asymmetric concentration parameters, where pip,k = f(Yp,?k, ?",

        "Through this linear parametrization, we build a direct matching between sentiment label i and rating i.",
        "For example, for a product p, if its overall rating distribution Y p has high probability over rating 4, for aspect k, we assume its product-aspect-sentiment label distribution also has high probability on sentiment label 4 in the prior.",
        "The actual aspect rating is affected by both the text which talks about aspect k, and also the prior.",

        "This is not true, thus will introduce noise to the training.",

        "An alternative approach is to use 5 sentiment labels(R=5).",
        "It provides finer grained sentiment extraction, but raises the question of how to choose seed words for each sentiment topic.",
        "To do this, we use the full sentiment lexicon in (Taboada et al., 2011), where sentiment words have polarity score in the range of [?5,?1] ?",
        "[1, 5].",
        "We divide the lexicon, and use words with polarity score 4 and 5 as prior for the sentiment topic with label 5.",
