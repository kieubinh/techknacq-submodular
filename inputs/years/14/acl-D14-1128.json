        "This paper deals with fine-grained sentiment analysis.",
        "We aim to make three contributions.",
        "First, based on a detailed linguistic analysis of contexts of the word ?hard?",
        "(Section 3), we give evidence that highly accurate sentiment analysis is only possible if senses with different polarity are accurately recognized.",
        "Second, based on this analysis, we propose to return to a lexicon-based approach to sentiment analysis that supports identifying sense distinctions relevant to sentiment.",
        "Currently available sentiment lexicons give the polarity for each word or each sense, but this is of limited utility if senses cannot be automatically identified in context.",
        "We extend the lexicon-based approach by introducing the concept of a contextually enhanced sentiment lexicon (CESL).",
        "The lexicon entry of a word w in CESL has three components: (i) the senses of w; (ii) a sentiment annotation of each sense; (iii) a data structure that, given a context in which w oc-curs, allows to identify the sense of w used in that context.",
        "As we will see in Section 3, the CESL sense inventory ?",
        "(i) above ?",
        "should be optimized for sentiment analysis: closely related senses with the same sentiment should be merged whereas subtle semantic distinctions that give rise to different polarities should be distinguished.",
        "The data structure in (iii) is a statistical classification model in the simplest case.",
        "We will give one other example for (iii) below: it can also be a set of centroids of context vector representations, with a mapping of these centroids to the senses.",
        "If sentiment-relevant sense disambiguation is the first step in sentiment analysis, then powerful contextual features are necessary to support making fine-grained distinctions.",
        "Our third contribution is that we experiment with deep learning as a source of such features.",
        "We look at two types of deep learning features: word embeddings and neural network language model predictions (Section 4).",
        "We show that deep learning features significantly improve the accuracy of context-dependent polarity classification (Sec- tion 5).",
        "2 Related work Initial work on sentiment analysis was either based on sentiment lexicons that listed words as positive or negative sentiment indicators (e.g., Turney (2002), Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003)), on statistical classification approaches that represent documents as ngrams (e.g., Pang et al. (2002)) or on a combination of both (e.g., Riloff et al. (2003), Whitelaw et al. (2005)).",
        "The underlying assumption of lexicon-based sentiment analysis is that a word always has the same sentiment.",
        "This is clearly wrong because words can have senses with different polarity, e.g., ?hard wood?",
        "(neutral) vs. ?hard memory?",
        "(negative).",
        "Ngram approaches are also limited because ngram representations are not a good basis for relevant generalizations.",
        "For example, the neutral adverbial sense ?intense?",
        "of ?hard?",

        "More recent compositional approaches to sentiment analysis can outperform lexicon and ngram-based methods (e.g., Socher et al. (2011), Socher et al. (2013)).",

        "From the point of view of linguistic theory, these are different types of contextual effects that should not be conflated.",

        "occurs in the scope of negation is of no use if the basic polarity of the contextually evoked sense of ?hard?",

        "First, they classify if a sentiment word is polar in a phrase and if so, second, they classify its polarity.",
        "Our approach can be seen as an extension of this approach; the main difference is that we will show in our analysis of ?hard?",
        "that the polarity of phrases depends on the senses of the words that are used.",
        "This is evidence that high-accuracy polarity classification depends on sense disambiguation.",
        "There has been previous work on assigning polarity values to senses of words taken from Word-Net (e.g., Baccianella et al. (2010), Wiebe and Mi-halcea (2006)).",
        "However, these approaches are not able to disambiguate the sense of a word given its context.",

        "Their models learn word embeddings that capture semantic similarities and word sentiment at the same time.",
        "Their approach focuses on sentiment of entire sentences or documents and does not consider each sentiment word instance at a local level.",
