        "Analyses of computer aided translation typically focus on either frontend interfaces and human effort, or backend translation and machine learnability of corrections.",
        "How-ever, this distinction is artificial in practice since the frontend and backend must work in concert.",
        "We present the first holis-tic, quantitative evaluation of these issues by contrasting two assistive modes: post-editing and interactive machine translation (MT).",
        "We describe a new translator inter-face, extensive modifications to a phrase-based MT system, and a novel objective function for re-tuning to human corrections.",
        "Evaluation with professional bilingual translators shows that post-edit is faster than interactive at the cost of translation quality for French-English and English-German.",
        "However, re-tuning the MT system to interactive output leads to larger, statistically significant reductions in HTER versus re-tuning to post-edit.",
        "Analysis shows that tuning directly to HTER results in fine-grained corrections to subsequent machine output."

        "The goal of machine translation has always been to reduce human effort, whether by partial assistance or by outright replacement.",
        "However, preoccupation with the latter?fully automatic translation?at the exclusion of the former has been a feature of the research community since its first nascent steps in the 1950s.",
        "Pessimistic about progress during that decade and future prospects, Bar-Hillel (1960, p.3) argued that more attention should be paid to a ?machine-post-editor partnership,?",
        "whose decisive problem is ?the region of optimality in the continuum of possible divisions of labor.?",
        "Today, with human-quality, fully automatic machine translation (MT) elusive still, that decades-old recommendation remains current.",
        "This paper is the first to look at both sides of the partnership in a single user study.",
        "We compare two common flavors of machine-assisted transla-tion: post-editing and interactive MT.",
        "We analyze professional, bilingual translators working in both modes, looking first at user productivity.",
        "Does the additional machine assistance available in the interactive mode affect translation time and/or quality?",
        "Then we turn to the machine side of the partnership.",
        "The user study results in corrections to the baseline MT output.",
        "Do these corrections help the MT system, and can it learn from them quickly enough to help the user?",
        "We perform a re-tuning experiment in which we directly optimize human Translation Edit Rate (HTER), which correlates highly with human judgments of fluency and adequacy (Snover et al., 2006).",
        "It is also an intuitive measure of human effort, making fine distinctions between 0 (no editing) and 1 (complete rewrite).",
        "We designed a new user interface (UI) for the experiment.",
        "The interface places demands on the MT backend?not the other way around.",
        "The most significant new MT system features are prefix de-coding, for translation completion based on a user prefix; and dynamic phrase table augmentation, to handle target out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.",
        "Discriminative re-tuning is accomplished with a novel cross-entropy objective function.",
        "We report three main findings: (1) post-editing is faster than interactive MT, corroborating Koehn (2009a); (2) interactive MT yields higher quality translation when baseline MT quality is high; and (3) re-tuning to interactive feedback leads to larger held-out HTER gains relative to post-edit.",
        "Together these results show that a human-centered approach to computer aided translation (CAT) may involve tradeoffs between human effort and machine learnability.",
        "For example, if speed is the top priority, then a design geared toward post-editing 1225 AB C D E Figure 1: Main translation interface.",
        "The user sees the full document context, with French source inputs (A) interleaved with suggested English translations (B).",
        "The sentence in focus is indicated by the blue rectangle, which can be moved via two hot keys.",
        "Source coverage (C) of the user prefix?shaded in blue?updates as the user works, as do autocomplete suggestions (D) and a full completion (E).",
        "is appropriate.",
        "However, if reductions in HTER ultimately correspond to lower human effort, then investing slightly more time in the interactive mode, which results in more learnable output, may be optimal.",
        "Mixed UI designs may offer a compromise.",
        "Code and data from our experiments are available at: http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/phrasal/ A holistic comparison with human subjects necessarily involves many moving parts.",
        "Section 2 briefly describes the interface, focusing on NLP components.",
        "Section 3 describes changes to the backend MT system.",
        "Section 4 explains the user study, and reports human translation time and quality results.",

        "2 New Translator User Interface Figure 1 shows the translator interface, which is designed for expert, bilingual translators.",
        "Previous studies have shown that expert translators work and type quickly (Carl, 2010), so the interface is designed to be very responsive, and to be primarily operated by the keyboard.",
        "Most aids can be accessed via either typing or four hot keys.",
        "The current design focuses on the point of text entry and does not include conventional translator workbench features such as workflow management, spell checking, and text formatting tools.",
        "In the trivial post-edit mode, the interactive aids are disabled and a 1-best translation pre-populates the text entry box.",
        "We have described the HCI-specific motivations for and contributions of this new interface in Green et al. (2014c).",
        "This section focuses on interface elements built on NLP components.",
        "2.1 UI Overview and Walkthrough We categorized interactions into three groups: source comprehension: word lookups, source coverage highlighting; target gisting: 1-best transla-tion, real-time target completion; target genera-tion: real-time autocomplete, target reordering, insert complete translation.",
        "The interaction designs are novel; those in italic have, to our knowledge, never appeared in a translation workbench.",
        "Source word lookup When the user hovers over a source word, a menu of up to four ranked translation suggestions appears (Figure 2).",
        "The menu is populated by a phrase-table query of the word plus one token of left context.",
        "This query usually returns in under 50ms.",
        "The width of the horizontal bars indicates confidence, with the most confident suggestion ?regularly?",
        "placed at the bottom, nearest to the cursor.",
        "The user can insert a translation suggestion by clicking.",
        "Source coverage highlighting The source coverage feature (Figure 1C) helps the user quickly find untranslated words in the source.",
        "The interaction is 1226 Figure 2: Source word lookup and target autocomplete menus.",
        "The menus show different suggestions.",
        "The word lookupmenu (top) is not dependent on the target context Teachers, whereas the autocomplete dropdown (bottom) is.",
        "based on the word alignments between source and target generated by the MT system.",
        "We found that the raw alignments are too noisy to show users, so the UI filters them with phrase-level heuristics.",
        "1-best translation The most common use of MT output is gisting (Koehn, 2010, p.21).",
        "The gray text below each black source input shows the best MT system output (Figure 1B).",
        "Real-time target completion When the user extends the black prefix, the gray text will update to the most probable completion (Figure 1E).",
        "This update comes from decoding under the full translation model.",
        "All previous systems performed inference in a word lattice.",
        "Real-time autocomplete The autocomplete dropdown at the point of text entry is the main translation aid (Figures 1D and 2).",
        "Each real-time update actually contains a distinct 10-best list for the full source input.",
        "The UI builds up a trie from these 10-best lists.",
        "Up to four distinct suggestions are then shown at the point of translation.",
        "The suggestion length is based on a syntactic parse of the fixed source input.",
        "As an offline, pre-processing step, we parse each source input with Stanford CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014).",
        "The UI combines those parses with word alignments from the full translation suggestions to project syntactic constituents to each item on the n-best list.",
        "Syntactic projection is a very old idea that underlies many MT systems (see: Hwa et al. (2002)).",
        "Here we make novel use of it for suggestion prediction filtering.",
        "1 Presently, we project noun phrases, verb phrases (minus the verbal arguments), and prepositional phrases.",
        "Crucially, these units are natural to humans, unlike statistical target phrases.",
        "Target Reordering Carl (2010) showed that expert translators tend to adopt local planning: they read a few words ahead and then translate in a roughly online fashion.",
        "However, word order differences between languages will necessarily require longer range planning and movement.",
        "To that end, the UI supports keyboard-based reordering.",
        "Suppose that the user wants to move a span in gray text to the insertion position for editing.",
        "Typing the prefix of this string will update the autocomplete dropdown with matching strings from the gray text.",
        "Consequently, sometimes the autocomplete dropdown will contain suggestions from several positions in the full suggested translation.",
        "Insert complete translation The user can insert the full completion via a hot key.",
        "Notice that if the user presses this hot key immediately, all gray text becomes black, and the interface effectively switches to post-edit mode.",
        "This feature greatly accelerates translation when the MT is mostly correct, and the user only wants to make a few changes.",
        "2.2 User Activity Logging A web application serves the Javascript-based in-terface, relays translation requests to the MT sys-tem, and logs user records to a database.",
        "Each user record is a tuple of the form (f, e?, h, u), where f is the source sequence, e?",
        "is the latest 1-best machine translation of f , h is the correction of e?, and u is the log of interaction events during the translation session.",
        "Our evaluation corpora also include independently generated references e for each f .",
        "3 Interactive MT Backend Now we describe modifications to Phrasal (Green et al., 2014b), the phrase-based MT system that supports the interface.",
        "Phrasal follows the log-linear approach to phrase-based translation (Och and Ney, 2004) in which the decision rule has the familiar linear form e?",
        "= arg max e w > ?",
        "(e, f) (1) 1 The classic TransType system included a probabilistic prediction length component (Foster et al., 2002), but we find that the simpler projection technique works well in practice.",
        "1227 where w ?",
        "R d is the model weight vector and ?(?)",
        "?",
        "R d is a feature map.",
        "3.1 Decoding The default Phrasal search algorithm is cube pruning (Huang and Chiang, 2007).",
        "In the post-edit con-dition, search is executed as usual for each source input, and the 1-best output is inserted into the target textbox.",
        "However, in interactive mode, the full search algorithm is executed each time the user modifies the partial translation.",
        "Machine suggestions e?",
        "must match user prefix h. Define indicator function pref(e?, h) to return true if e?",
        "begins with h, and false otherwise.",
        "Eq. 1 becomes: e?",
        "= arg max e s.t.pref(e,h) w > ?",
        "(e, f) (2) Cube pruning can be straightforwardly modified to satisfy this constraint by simple string matching of candidate translations.",
        "Also, the pop limit must be suspended until at least one legal candidate appears on each beam, or the priority queue of candidates is exhausted.",
        "We call this technique prefix decoding.",
        "2 There is another problem.",
        "Human translators are likely to insert unknown target words, including new vocabulary, misspellings, and typographical errors.",
        "They might also reorder source text so as to violate the phrase-based distortion limit.",
        "To solve these problems, we perform dynamic phrase table augmentation, adding new synthetic rules specific to each search.",
        "Rules allowing any source word to align with any unseen or ungeneratable (due to the distortion limit) target word are created.",
        "3 These synthetic rules are given rule scores lower than any other rules in the set of queried rules for that source input f .",
        "Then candidates are allowed to compete on the beam.",
        "Candidates with spurious alignments will likely be pruned in favor of those that only turn to synthetic rules as a last resort.",
        "3.2 Tuning We choose BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) for baseline tuning to independent references, and HTER for re-tuning to human corrections.",
        "Our rationale is as follows: Cer et al. (2010) showed that BLEU-tuned systems score well across automatic metrics and also correlate with human judgment better than 2 Och et al. (2003) describe a similar algorithm for word graphs.",
        "3 Ortiz-Mart?nez et al. (2009) describe a related technique in which all source and target words can align, with scores set by smoothing.",
        "systems tuned to other metrics.",
        "Conversely, systems tuned to edit-distance-based metrics like TER tend to produce short translations that are heavily penalized by other metrics.",
        "When human corrections become available, we switch to HTER, which correlates with human judgment and is an interpretable measure of editing effort.",
        "Whereas TER is computed as TER(e, e?",
        "), HTER is HTER(h, e?).",
        "HBLEU is an alternative, but since BLEU is invariant to some permutations (Callison-Burch et al., 2006), it is less interpretable.",
        "We find that it also does not work as well in practice.",
        "We previously proposed a fast, online tuning algorithm (Green et al., 2013b) based on AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011).",
        "The default loss function is expected error (EE) (Och, 2003; Cherry and Foster, 2012).",
        "Expected BLEU is an example of EE, which we found to be unstable when switching metrics.",
        "This may result from direct incorporation of the error metric into the gradient computation.",
        "To solve this problem, we propose a cross-entropy loss which, to our knowledge, is new in MT.",
        "Let ?",
        "E = {e?",

        "i )/ log(1 + i) for the ith ranked item.",
        "The cross-entropy (CE) loss function is: ` CE (w;E) = E p(e?|f) [?",
        "log(q(e?|f)] (3) It turns out that if p is simply the posterior distribution of the metric, then this loss is related to the log of the standard EE loss: 5 ` EE (w;E) = ?",

        "` EE by applying Jensen's inequality to the function ?",
        "log(?).",
        "So minimizing ` CE also minimizes a convex upper bound of the log expected error.",
        "This convexity given the n-4 Discounted cumulative gain (DCG) is widely used in information retrieval learning-to-rank settings.",
        "n-best MT learning is standardly formulated as a ranking task.",
        "5 For expected error, p(e?",
        "i ) = G(e, e?",
        "i ) is not usually normalized.",
        "Normalizing p adds a negligible constant.",
        "1228 best list does not mean that the overall MT tuning loss is convex, since the n-best list contents and order depend on the parameters w. However, all regret bounds and other guarantees of online convex optimization would now apply in the CE case since ` CE,t (w t?1 ;E t ) is convex for each t. This is attractive compared to expected error, which is non-convex even given the n-best list.",
        "We empirically observed that CE converges faster and is less sensitive to hyperparameters than EE.",
        "Faster decoding trick We found that online tuning also permits a trick that speeds up decoding during deployment.",
        "Whereas the Phrasal default beam size is 1,200, we were able to reduce the beam size to 800 and run the tuner longer to achieve the same level of translation quality.",
        "For example, at the default beam size for French-English, the algorithm converges after 12 iterations, whereas at the lower beam size it achieves that level after 20 iterations.",
        "In our experience, batch tuning algorithms seem to be more sensitive to the beam size.",
        "3.3 Feature Templates The baseline system contains 19 dense feature tem-plates: the nine Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) baseline features, the eight-feature hierarchical lexicalized re-ordering model of Galley and Manning (2008), the (log) count of each rule in the bitext, and an indicator for unique rules.",
        "We found that sparse features, while improving translation quality, came at the cost of slower decoding due to feature extraction and inner products with a higher dimensional feature map ?.",
        "During prototyping, we observed that users found the system to be sluggish unless it responded in approximately 300ms or less.",
        "This budget restricted us to dense features.",
        "When re-tuning to corrections, we extract features from the user logs u and add them to the baseline dense model.",
