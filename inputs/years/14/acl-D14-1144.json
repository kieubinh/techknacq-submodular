        "It has been noted in the linguistics literature since the 1950s that speakers of particular languages have characteristic production patterns when writing in a second language.",
        "This language transfer phenomenon has been investigated independently in a number of fields from different perspectives, including qualitative research in Second Language Acquisition (SLA) and more recently though predictive computational models in NLP.",
        "Motivated by the aim of improving foreign language teaching and learning, such analyses are often done manually in SLA, and are difficult to perform for large corpora.",
        "Smaller studies yield poor results due to the sample size, leading to extreme variability (Ellis, 2008).",
        "Recently, researchers have noted that NLP has the tools to use large amounts of data to automate this analysis, using complex feature types.",
        "This has motivated studies in Native Language Identification (NLI), a subtype of text classification where the goal is to determine the native language (L1) of an author using texts they have written in a second language (L2) (Tetreault et al., 2013).",
        "Despite the good results in predicting L1s, few attempts have been made to interpret the features that distinguish L1s.",
        "This is partly because no methods for an SLA-oriented feature analysis have been proposed; most work focuses on testing feature types using standard machine learning tools.",
        "The overarching contribution of this work is to develop a methodology that enables the transformation of the NLI paradigm into SLA applications that can be used to link these features to their underlying linguistic causes and explanations.",
        "These candidates can then be applied in other areas such as remedial SLA strategies or error detection.",
        "2 Related Work SLA research aims to find distributional differences in language use between L1s, often referred to as overuse, the extensive use of some linguistic structures, and underuse, the underutilization of particular structures, also known as avoidance (Gass and Selinker, 2008).",
        "While there have been some attempts in SLA to use computational approaches on small-scale data, 1 these still use fairly elementary techniques and have several shortcom-ings, including in the manual approaches to annotation and the computational artefacts derived from these.",
        "Conversely, NLI work has focused on automatic learner L1 classification using Machine Learning with large-scale data and sophisticated linguistic features (Tetreault et al., 2012).",
        "Here, feature ranking could be performed with relevancy methods such as the F-score: 1 E.g. Chen (2013), Lozan?o and Mendikoetxea (2010) and Di?ez-Bedmar and Papp (2008).",

        "Another alternative method is Information Gain (Yang and Pedersen, 1997).",

        "Among the efflorescence of NLI work, a new trend explored by Swanson and Charniak (2014) aims to extract lists of candidate language transfer features by comparing L2 data against the writer's L1 to find features where the L1 use is mirrored in L2 use.",
        "This allows the detection of obvious ef-fects, but Jarvis and Crossley (2012) note (p. 183) that many transfer effects are ?too complex?",
        "to observe in this manner.",
        "Moreover, this method is unable to detect underuse, is only suitable for syntactic features, and has only been applied to very small data (4,000 sentences) over three L1s.",
        "Addressing these issues is the focus of the present work.",

        "We then generate all the variations for each of the dependencies (grammatical rela-tions) by substituting each lemma with its corresponding POS tag.",

        "Lexical features Content and function words are also considered as two feature types related to learner's vocabulary and spelling.",

        "They have been chosen to demonstrate all feature types and also a variety of different languages.",
        "For reasons of space, only several of the top features are analysed here.",
        "Hindi L1 writers are distinguished by certain function words including hence, thus, and etc, and a much higher usage rate of male pronouns.",
        "It has been observed in the literature (Sanyal, 2007, for example) that the English spoken in India still retains characteristics of the English that was spoken during the time of the Raj and the East India Company that have disappeared from other English va-rieties, so it sounds more formal to other speakers, or retains traces of an archaic business correspondence style; the features noted fit that pattern.",
        "The second list includes content words overused by Arabic L1 learners.",
        "Analysis of content words here, and for other L1s in our data, reveals very frequent misspellings which are believed to be due to orthographic or phonetic influences (Tsur and Rappoport, 2007; Odlin, 1989).",
        "Since Arabic does not share orthography with English, we believe most of these are due to phonetics.",
        "Looking at items 1, 3 and 5 we can see a common pattern: the English letter u which has various phonetic realizations is being replaced by a vowel that more often represents that sound.",
        "Items 2 and 5 are also phonetically similar to the intended words.",
        "For Spanish L1 authors we provide both underuse and overuse lists of syntactic dependencies.",
        "The top 3 overuse rules show the word that is very often used as the subject of verbs.",
        "This is almost 6 See Burges (1998) for a detailed explanation.",
        "certainly a consequence of the prominent syntactic role played by the Spanish word que which, depending on the context, is equivalent to the English words whom, who, which, and most commonly, that.",
        "The fourth rule shows they often use this as a determiner for plural nouns.",
        "A survey of the corpus reveals many such errors in texts of Spanish learners, e.g. this actions or this emissions.",
        "The fifth rule shows that the adjectival modifier of a plural noun is often being incorrectly pluralised to match the noun in number as would be required in Spanish, for example, differents subjects.",
        "Turning to the underused features in Spanish L1 texts, we see that four related features rank highly, showing that these is not commonly used as a determiner for plural nouns and which is rarely used as a subject.",
        "The final feature shows that no is avoided as a determiner.",
        "This may be because while no mostly has the same role in Spanish as it does in English, it cannot be used as a determiner; ning?un must be used instead.",
        "We hypothesize that this construction is being avoided as placing no before a noun in Spanish is ungrammatical.",
        "This example demonstrates that our two list methodology can not only help identify overused structures, but also uncovers the related constructs that are being underutilized at their expense.",
        "The final list in Table 1 is of underused Adaptor Grammar patterns by Chinese learners.",
        "The first three features show that these writers significantly underuse determiners, here an, other and these before nouns.",
        "This is not unexpected since Chinese learners?",
        "difficulties with English articles are well known (Robertson, 2000).",
        "More inter-estingly, we find underuse of features like even if and might, along with others not listed here such as could VB 7 plus many other variants related to the subjunctive mood.",
        "One explanation is that linguistic differences between Chinese and English in expressing counterfactuals could cause them to avoid such constructions in L2 English.",
        "Previous research in this area has linked the absence of subjunctive linguistic structures in Chinese to different cognitive representations of the world and consequences for thinking counterfactually (Bloom, 2014), although this has been disputed (Au, 1983; Garbern Liu, 1985).",

        "This list includes many cognates, in contrast with the Arabic L1 data where most misspellings were phonetic in nature.",
        "We also observe other patterns which remain unexplained.",
        "For instance, Chinese, Japanese and Korean speakers make excessive use of phrases such as however, first and second.",
        "One possibility is that this relates to argumentation styles that are possibly influenced by cultural norms.",
        "More broadly, this effect could also be teaching rather than transfer related.",
        "For example, it may be case that a widely-used text book for learning English in Korea happens to overuse this construction.",
        "Some recent findings from the 2013 NLI Shared Task found that L1 Hindi and Telugu learners of English had similar transfer effects and their writings were difficult to distinguish.",
        "It has been posited that this is likely due to shared culture and teaching environments (Malmasi et al., 2013).",
        "Despite some clearcut instances of overuse, 9 more research is required to determine the causal factors.",
        "We hope to expand on this in future work using more data.",

        "5 Discussion and Conclusion Using the proposed methodology, we generated lists of linguistic features overused and underused by English learners of various L1 backgrounds.",
        "Through an analysis of the top items in these ranked lists, we demonstrated the high applicability of the output by formulating plausible language transfer hypotheses supported by current evidence.",
        "We also showcased the method's generalizability to numerous linguistic feature types.",
        "Our method's output consists of two ranked lists of linguistic features: one for overuse and the other for underuse, something which had not been addressed by research to date.",
        "We also found Adaptor Grammar collocations to be highly informative for this task.",
        "This work, an intersection of NLP, Machine Learning and SLA, illustrates how the various disciplines can complement each other by bringing together theoretical, experimental and computational issues.",
        "NLP provides accurate and automated tagging of large corpora with sophisticated features not available in corpus linguistics, e.g. with state-of-the-art dependency parsing.",
        "Sophisticated machine learning techniques then enable the processing of large quantities of data (thou- sands of times the size of manual studies) in a way that will let SLA researchers explore a variety of assumptions and theoretical analyses.",
        "And con-versely, NLP can benefit from the long-term study and language acquisition insights from SLA.",
        "In terms of NLI, this work is the first attempt to expand NLI to a broad linguistic interpretation of the data, including feature underuse.",
        "NLI systems achieve classification accuracies of over 80% on this 11-class task, leading to theoretical questions about the features that make them so effective.",
        "This work also has a backwards link in this regard by providing qualitative evidence about the underpinning linguistic theories that make NLI work.",
        "1388 The work presented here has a number of ap-plications; chief among them is the development of tools for SLA researchers.",
        "This would enable them to not just provide new evidence for previous findings, but to also perform semi-automated data-driven generation of new and viable hypotheses.",
        "This, in turn, can help reduce expert effort and involvement in the process, particularly as such studies expand to more corpora and emerging language like Chinese (Malmasi and Dras, 2014b) and Arabic (Malmasi and Dras, 2014a).",
        "The brief analysis included here represents only a tiny portion of what can be achieved with this methodology.",
        "We included but a few of the thousands of features revealed by this method; practical SLA tools based on this would have a great impact on current research.",
        "In addition to language transfer hypotheses, such systems could also be applied to aid development of pedagogical material within a needs-based and data-driven approach.",
        "Once language use patterns are uncovered, they can be assessed for teachability and used to create tailored, L1-specific exercises and teaching material.",
        "From the examples discussed in Section 4 these could include highly specific and targeted student exercises to improve spelling, expand vocabulary and enrich syntactic knowledge ?",
        "all relative to their mother tongue.",
        "Such exercises can not only help beginners improve their fundamental skills and redress their errors but also assist advanced learners in moving closer to near-nativeness.",
        "The extracted features and their weights could also be used to build statistical models for grammatical error detection (Leacock et al., 2014).",
        "Contrary to the norm of developing error checkers for native writers, such models could be specifically targeted towards learners or even particular L1?L2 pairs which could be useful in Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) systems.",
        "One limitation here is that our features may be corpus-dependent as they are all exam essays.",
        "This can be addressed by augmenting the data with new learner corpora, as they become available.",
        "While a strength here is that we compared each L1 against others, a paired comparison only against native texts can be insightful too.",
        "There are several directions for future work.",
        "The first relates to clustering the data within the lists.",
        "Our intuition is that there might be coherent clusters of related features, with these clusters characterising typical errors or idiosyncrasies, that are predictive of a particular L1.",
        "As shown in our results, some features are highly related and may be caused by the same underlying transfer phenomena.",
        "For example, our list of overused syntactic constructs by Spanish learners includes three high ranking features related to the same transfer effect.",
        "The use of unsupervised learning methods such as Bayesian mixture models may be appropriate here.",
        "For parse features, tree kernels could help measure similarity between the trees and fragments (Collins and Duffy, 2001).",
        "Another avenue is to implement weight-based ranking methods to further refine and re-rank the lists, potentially by incorporating the measures mentioned in Section 2 to assign weights to features.",
        "As the corpus we used includes learner proficiency metadata, it may also be possible to create proficiency-segregated models to find the features that characterise errors at each language proficiency level.",
        "Finally, the use of other linguistic features such as Context-free Grammar phrase structure rules or Tree Substitution Grammars could provide additional insights.",
        "In addition to these further technical investiga-tions, we see as a particularly useful direction the development of an SLA research tool to conduct a large SLA study with a wide range of experts.",
        "We believe that this study makes a contribution to this area and hope that it will motivate future work.",
