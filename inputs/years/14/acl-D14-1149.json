        "Natural language consists of a number of relational structures, many of which can be obscured by lexical idiosyncrasies, regional variation and domain-specific conventions.",
        "Despite this, patterns of word use exhibit loose semantic struc-ture, namely that proximate words tend to be related.",
        "This distributional hypothesis has been op-erationalized in a variety of ways, providing insights and solutions into practical and theoretical questions about meaning, intention and the use of language.",
        "Distributional analyses rely primarily on observing natural language to build statistical representations of words, phrases and documents (Turney and Pantel, 2010).",
        "By studying dictionaries and thesauri, lexicographic and terminological research has proposed that a core lexicon is used to define the remaining portions of vocabulary (It?o and Mester, 1995; Mass?e et al., 2008).",
        "Though many words that comprise general language use reside in this core lexicon, even the most general language contains specialist or so-called ?satellite?",
        "words.",
        "This paper introduces a method of extracting this peripheral structure, with co-occurrence networks of unstructured text.",
        "The core-periphery structure has been observed in dictionaries where definitions tend to use a restricted vocabulary, repetitively employing a core set of words to define others (Sinclair, 1996; Picard et al., 2013).",
        "In the farther regions of the lex-icon, it is more difficult to find systematic semantic definition with corpus-based techniques due to the overwhelming number of infrequent words.",
        "Unfortunately, the fringe of the lexicon can be more important than the core because this is where domain-specific terminology resides ?",
        "features that may be more important than frequent.",
        "Examining dictionaries, (Picard et al., 2013) propose that the lexicon consists of four main parts: a core set of ubiquitous words used to define other words, a kernel that makes up most of the lexicon, a minimal grounding set that includes most of the core and some of the kernel, leaving a set of satellites in the periphery.",
        "This to-pography, reproduced in Figure 1, has been found in the way dictionary entries use words to define one another.",
        "In networks of dictionary defini-tions, the core component tends to form a strongly connected component (SCC) leaving satellites in smaller SCCs with relatively weak links to the core.",
        "This paper explores whether these these satellites form systematic, cohesive groups and whether they are observable in natural language.",
        "1426 Figure 1: Dictionary studies have proposed that the lexicon consists of a strongly connected core, around which there is a kernel, an asymmetric grounding set and satellites.",
        "Adapted from (Picard et al., 2013).",
        "Words with relatively specific definitions within subjects, referred to as terms in lexicographic re-search, are apparent in nearly all domains of discourse.",
        "Here, the goal is to explore structure among these peripheral terms without a dictionary.",
        "To do this, a method based on community detection in textual co-occurrence networks is developed.",
        "Such graph-based methods have become increasingly popular in a range of language-related tasks such as word clustering, document clustering, semantic memory, anaphora resolution and dependency parsing (see Mihalcea and Radev, 2011 for a review).",
        "This paper seeks to address two important questions about the observed landscape of the lexicon in natural language: to investigate whether satellite clusters found in dictionaries can be observed in text, and more importantly, to explore whether statistical information in co-occurrence networks can elucidate this peripheral structure in the lexicon.",
        "We frame these questions as the task of extracting clusters of related terms.",
        "If satellites are systematically organized, then we can expect to find cohesive clusters in this region.",
        "Moreover, if the networked structure of dictionary entries supports the landscape in Figure 1, a similar structure may be present in co-occurrence patterns in natural text.",
        "2 Method Word clustering, as a means to explore underlying lexical structure, should accommodate fuzzy and potentially contradictory notions of similarity.",
        "For example, red and green are at once similar, being colors, but as colors, they are very different.",
        "Alternatively, the words car, fast, wheel, export and motorists share a thematic similarity in their relation to automobiles.",
        "One conception of word clustering is to construct a thesaurus of synonyms (Calvo et al., 2005), but clustering could allow other lexical semantic relationships.",
        "One such database, WordNet, defines specific semantic relationships and has been used to group words according to explicit measures of relatedness and similarity (Miller, 1995; Pedersen et al., 2004).",
        "Distributional, corpus-based techniques that define words as feature vectors (eg.",
        "word-document co-occurrences), can address many limitations of manually created lexicons (see Turney et al., 2010 for a review).",
        "Clustering nouns by argument structure can uncover naturally related objects (Hin- dle, 1990) and spectral methods can relate distinct classes of nouns with certain kinds of verbs to induce selectional preferences (Resnik, 1997; Sun and Korhonen, 2009; Wilks, 1975) and assist metaphor processing (Shutova et al., 2013).",
        "A pervasive weakness of many existing approaches to word-clustering, is an underlying prioritization of frequent words.",
        "To help address this sparsity, many models collapse words into stems, preclude uncommon words, or underestimate the relevance of infrequent words (Dagan et al., 1999).",
        "Probabilistic topic models have emerged as a uniquely flexible kind of word-clustering used in content analysis (Steyvers and Griffiths, 2007), text classification (Wei and Croft, 2006) and provide an extensible framework to address other tasks (Blei, 2012).",
        "Because the structure of satellite terms is not likely to rely on specific (much less consistent) lexical semantic re-lationships, we adopt a measure of semantic co-herence, commonly used to qualify the results of topic models, as an indirect measure of what people tend to view as a cohesive set of words.",
        "This measure, which is defined in the next section, is particularly attractive because it is corpus-based, does not assume any specific semantic relationship and correlates with expert evaluations (Mimno et al., 2011; Newman et al., 2010).",
        "Using semantic coherence provides a way of measuring the qual-1427 ity of word-associations without appeal to a dictionary or assuming rigid relationships among the clustered words.",
        "The first step is to construct a co-occurrence graph from which communities are extracted.",
        "Then the centrality of each word is computed within a community to generate cluster-specific rankings.",
        "The goal is not to categorize words into classes, nor to provide partitions that separate associated words across a corpus.",
        "Instead, the method is designed to extract qualifiable sets of specialist terms found in arbitrary text.",
        "Crucially, the method is designed to require no document structure and minimal pre-processing: stop-words and non-words are not removed and no phrasal, sentence or document structure is required.",
        "Although stemming or lemmatization could provide more stream-lined interpretations, the minimal pre-processing allows the method to operate efficiently on large amounts of unstructured text of any language.",
        "Co-occurrence networks have been used in a variety of NLP applications, the basic idea being to construct a graph where proximate words are connected.",
        "Typically, words are connected if they are observed in an n-word window.",
        "We set this window to a symmetric 7 words on either side of the target and did not use any weighting 1 .",
        "In the resulting network, edge frequencies are set to the number of times the given co-occurrence is observed.",
        "The resulting networks are typically quite dense and exhibit small-world structure where most word-pairs are only a few edges apart (Baronchelli et al., 2013; Ferror i Can-cho and Sol?e, 2001).",
        "To explore the effect of this density, different minimum node- and edge-frequencies were tested (analogous to the word- and co-occurrence frequencies in text).",
        "It was found that not setting any thresholds provided the best results (see Figure 2), supporting our minimal pre-processing approach.",
        "To extract clusters from the co-occurrence ma-trix, the Infomap community detection algorithm was used.",
        "Infomap is an information-theoretic method that optimizes a compression dictionary using it to describe flow through connected nodes (Rosvall and Bergstrom, 2008).",
        "By minimizing a description of this flow, the algorithm can also extract nested communities (Rosvall and Bergstrom, 1 7 was found to be the optimal window-size in terms of coherence.",
        "These preliminary results are available at knowl-edgelab.org/docs/coherent clusters-data.xls.",

        "2011).",
        "In our experiments, we used the co-occurrence frequencies as edge-weights and ran 50 trials for each run of the algorithm.",
        "Co-occurrence networks tended to form one monolithic community, corresponding to the lexicon's core SCC, surrounded by a number of smaller communities.",
        "The monolithic community is discarded out-right, as it represents the core of the lexicon where few specialist terms reside.",
        "As we will see, the community detection algorithm naturally identifies this SCC, distinguishing satellite clusters of terminology.",
        "Though we do not explore its effect, the sensitivity of Infomap can be tuned to vary the relative size of the core SCC compared to the satellites, effectively allowing less modular communities to be considered satellites.",
        "To compare and interpret the resulting clus-ters, various measures of centrality were tested for ranking words within their communities.",
        "The goal of this ranking is to find words that typify or define their community without assuming its underlying semantics.",
        "The results in the next section show that a number of common centrality measures work comparably well for this task.",
        "The final output of the system is a set of communities, in which words are ranked by their centrality.",
        "3 Results & Analysis Three corpora were used for evaluation: the TASA, NIPS and enTenTen collections.",
        "TASA consists of paragraph-length excerpts from high-school level, American English texts (Landauer and Dumais, 1997).",
        "The NIPS collection contains 17 volumes of annual proceedings from the conference of the same name.",
        "The enTenTen corpus is a web-based collection of text-heavy, English web-sites.",
        "Table 1 summarizes the collections and their co-occurrence networks.",
        "The extracted communities, which consist of word-centrality pairs, are similarly structured to the output of topic models.",
        "Because appeals to human judgement are expensive and can introduce issues of consistency (Chang et al., 2009; Hu et al., 2011), a corpus-based measure of semantic coherence has been proposed (Mimno et al., 2011).",
        "Co-1428 herence is used as a proxy for human judgments.",
        "A general form of semantic coherence can be defined as the mean pair-wise similarity over the top n words in a topic or cluster t C(t) = 1 n n ?",
        "(w i ,w j )?t i<j S(w i , w j ) where S is a symmetric measure of similarity.",
        "Newman, et al. (2010) surveyed a number of similarity metrics and found that mean point-wise mutual information (PMI) correlated best to human judgements.",
        "PMI is a commonly used measure of how much more information co-occurring words convey together compared to their independent contributions (Church and Hanks, 1990; Bouma, 2009).",
        "Using PMI as S, we can define a version of coherence, known as UCI Coherence: C UCI (t) = 1 n n ?",
        "(w i ,w j )?t i<j log p(w i , w j ) p(w i )p(w j ) where p(w) is estimated as relative frequency in a corpus: f(w)?",
        "i f(w i ) .",
        "Using coherence to optimize topic models, Mimno et al. (2011) found that a simplified measure, termed UMass Coherence, is more strongly correlated to human judgments than C UCI .",
        "For topic t, C UMass is defined as follows: C UMass (t) = 1 n n ?",
        "(w i ,w j )?t i<j log D(w i , w j ) + 1 D(w j ) where D(w) is the number of documents containing w, and D(w,w ? )",
        "is the number of documents containing both w and w ?",
        ".",
        "Note that D relies crucially on document segmentation in the reference corpus, which is not encoded in the co-occurrence networks derived by the method described above.",
        "Thus, though the networks being analyzed and the coherence scores are both based on co-occurrence information, they are distinct from one another.",
        "Following convention, we compute coherence for the top 10 words in a given community.",
        "C UMass was used as the measure of semantic coherence.",
        "and D was computed over the TASA corpus, which means the resulting scores are not directly comparable to (Mimno et al., 2011), though comparisons to other published results are provided below.",
        "3.1 Ranking Functions & Frequency Thresholds After communities are extracted from the co-occurrence graph, words are ranked by their centrality in a community.",
        "Six centrality measures were tested as ranking functions: degree centrality, closeness centrality, eigenvector centrality, Page-rank, hub-score and authority-score (Friedl et al., 2010).",
        "Degree centrality uses a node's degree as its centrality under the assumption that highly connected nodes are central.",
        "Closeness centrality measures the average distance between a node and all other nodes, promoting nodes that are ?close?",
        "to the rest of the network.",
        "Eigenvector centrality favors well-connected nodes that are themselves connected to well-connected nodes.",
        "Pagerank is similar to eigenvector centrality, but also promotes nodes that mediate connections between strongly connected nodes.",
        "Hub and authority scores measure interconnectedness (hubs) and connectedness to interconnected nodes (authorities).",
        "Figure 2 shows the average coherence, across all communities extracted from the TASA corpus, for each centrality measure.",
        "The average coherence scores are highest using hub-score, though not significantly better than auth-score, eigenvector centrality or closeness centrality.",
        "In the results that fol-low, hub-scores were used to rank nodes within communities.",
        "Figure 2: Mean coherence for six centrality measures.",
        "Error-bars are ?2 SE of the mean.",
        "1429 Imposing minimum node and edge frequencies in the co-occurrence graph was also tested.",
        "How-ever, applying no thresholds provided the highest average coherence.",
        "Figure 3 shows the average coherence for eight threshold configurations.",

        "Normalizing the scores preserves their rank-ordering and provides an indication of relative centrality within the community itself.",
        "For example, compare the first and last words from the top TASA and NIPS clusters: the difference between thou and craven (TASA) is considerably more than model and network (NIPS).",
        "In general, higher ranked words appear to typify their communities, with words like model, university and nuclear in the NIPS examples.",
        "These clusters are typical of those produced by the method, though in some cases, the communities contain less than 10 terms and were not included in the coherence analysis.",
        "Note that these clusters are not systematic in any lexical semantic sense, though in almost every case there are discernible thematic relations (middle-English words, Latin America and seafood in TASA).",

        "The contribution of this method is two-fold: it confirms the structure of the observed lexicon is similar to that apparent in the organization of dictionaries (Picard et al., 2013).",
        "Second, it offers a tractable, reliable means of extracting and summarizing structure in the fringes of the lexicon.",
        "The output of the model developed here is similar to topic models, but with some important differences.",

        "Instead of probabilities, the within-1431 community hub-scores were used to rank words in each cluster.",
        "This means that the actual structure of the community (to which topics have no ana-logue) is responsible for producing the scores that rate words?",
        "internal relevance.",
        "Another crucial difference is that topic size from a single sampling iteration tends to correlate with coherence (Mimno et al., 2011), but in the current method, there is no correlation between cluster size and coherence (p = 0.98).",
        "The other important difference is that whereas topic models produce a topic-document mixture that can be used for posterior inference, to perform such inference with our method, the output would have to be used indirectly.",
        "One understated strength of the community detection method is the minimal required preprocessing.",
        "Whereas many solutions in NLP (including topic models) require document seg-mentation, lexical normalization and statistical normalizations on the co-occurrence matrix it-self, the only variable in our method is the co-occurrence window size.",
        "However, lemmatization (or stemming) could help collapse morpho-syntactic variation among terms in the results, but stop-word removal, sentence segmentation and TF-IDF weighting appear unnecessary.",
        "What might be most surprising given the examples in Table 2 is that word-document occurrence information is not used at all.",
        "This makes the the method particularly useful for large collections with little to no structure.",
        "One question overlooked in our analysis concerns the effect the core has on the satellites.",
        "It could be that the proportional size of a collection's core is indicative of the degree of specialist terminology contained in the collection.",
        "Also, the raw number of satellite communities might indicate the level of diversity in a corpus.",
        "Addressing these questions could yield measures of previously vague and latent variables like specialty or topical diversity, without employing a direct semantic analysis.",
        "By measuring a collection's core size, relative to its satellites, one could also use measure changes in specialization.",
        "The Infomap algorithm could accommodate such an experiment: by varying the threshold of density that constitutes a community, the core could be made smaller, yielding more satellites, the coherence of which could be compared to those reported here.",
        "One could examine the position of individual words in the satel-lite(s) to explore what features signal important, emerging and dying terms or to track diachronic movement of terms like computer or gene from the specialized periphery to core of the lexicon.",
        "At the level of inter-related term clusters, there are likely important or central groups that influence other satellites.",
        "There is no agreed upon measure of ?community centrality?",
        "in a network sense (Eaton and Mansbach, 2012).",
        "One way to measure the importance of a community would be to use significance testing on the internal link mass compared to the external (Csardi and Nepusz, 2006).",
        "However, this approach discards some factors for which one might want to account, such as centrality in the network of communities and their composition.",
        "Future work could seek to combine graph-theoretic notions of centrality and intuitions about the defining features of term clusters.",
        "Another avenue for future research would be to use mixed membership community detection (Gopalan and Blei, 2013).",
        "Allowing terms to be represented in more than one community would accommodate words like nuclear, that might be found relating to weaponry, energy production and physics research at the same time.",
