        "and Related Works Intrinsic plagiarism detection is an essential alternative in situations where the plagiarism source does not have a digital version, e.g. an old book, or the plagiarized text was directly written by another author without copying from any source, e.g. the case of a student who asked someone else to write for him parts of his essay or thesis.",
        "Hence, the task of detecting plagiarism intrinsically is to identify, in the given suspicious document, the fragments that are not consistent with the rest of the text in terms of writing style.",
        "The automatic analysis of the writing style is an important component of many NLP applications.",
        "For some of them, when analyzing the style, a document is considered as a whole, which is the case of the authorship identification (Stamatatos, 2009a) and the authorship verification (Koppel and Seidman, 2013).",
        "For other ap-plications, a document is perceived as a set of fragments, for each of them the writing style needs to be analyzed individually.",
        "Examples of such applications include: paragraph authorship clustering (Brooke and Hirst, 2012), authorial segmentation of multi-author documents (Akiva and Koppel, 2013), detection of stylistic inconsistencies between consecutive paragraphs (Graham et al., 2005) and plagiarism direction identification (Grozea and Popescu, 2010).",
        "For intrinsic plagiarism detection, it is crucial to analyze the writing style at fragments level.",
        "However, the majority of methods tend to analyze the whole document writing style as well.",
        "Indeed, intrinsic plagiarism detection puts to-gether, in one research problem, many difficulties that are not present, or present separately, in the aforementioned related problems.",
        "Its main difficulties are listed below.",
        "In contrast to multi-author documents related problems, the number of authors in the suspicious documents is unknown, i.e., it might be one author if the document is plagiarism-free or many unknown authors if it contains plagiarism.",
        "Unlike the authorship attribution and verifica-tion, where the examined text and the potential author text are separate (and hence their writing styles could be readily characterized and com-pared), these two parts are both merged in the same document with unknown boundaries.",
        "Fur-thermore, the plagiarized fragments in a suspicious document might stem from different au-thors, which renders the computational characterization of plagiarism difficult.",
        "As opposed to the problem of authorship clus-tering, where the task is merely to attribute already defined fragments of a given document to different authors, the segmentation is a crucial and inevitable task in a real scenario of intrinsic plagiarism detection.",
        "Indeed, a granular segmentation may lead to an undependable style analy-sis, and a coarse segmentation may prevent the identification of the short plagiarized texts.",
        "Due to the aforementioned difficulties, intrinsic plagiarism detection is still a challenging 1459 problem.",
        "This is evidenced by the still low performance scores of the majority of methods1.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, just two methods, namely Stamatatos (2009b) and Oberreuter et al. (2011), reached an f-measure greater than 0.30 on a standardized corpus.",
        "Other methods, for instance (Stein et al., 2011) and (Tschuggnall and Specht, 2013), obtained better performance scores.",
        "Nonetheless, they have been evaluated on only selected documents from the whole standardized evaluation corpus which makes their results not comparable to the others.",
        "Although the writing style analysis is an old research area and has been applied successfully to solve many problems, notably authorship at-tribution, it is obvious that its application to identify the plagiarized fragments still needs to be investigated further.",
        "In this paper, we address this research problem by proposing a novel way of quantifying the writing style that we called n-gram classes.",
        "We show that our method, which is supervised classification-based, is able to discriminate between the plagiarized and the original text fragments with a performance comparable to the best state-of-the-art methods despite it uses a small number of features when building the classification model.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents our motivation.",
        "Sections 3 and 4 present the new features and the proposed method.",
        "Section 5 provides the evaluation results.",
        "Finally, Section 6 draws our conclusions.",
        "2 Motivation The idea of our method is inspired by the work of Grozea and Popescu (2010), in the context of plagiarism direction identification.",
        "They reported that the character 8-grams of a plagiarized text fragment are more frequent in the source document (because the author is the same) than in the plagiarized document.",
        "Thus, we believe that, it is possible to distinguish the plagiarized fragments from the original ones on the basis of the frequency of their character n-grams in the suspicious document.",
        "That is, if many of the character n-grams of a fragment are infrequent in the doc-ument, it would be probably a plagiarized fragment.",
        "However, if many of them are frequent, then the fragment is likely to be original.",
        "On the other hand, according to the authorship attribution researches, character n-grams are a 1 See for instance PAN workshop (http://pan.webis.de) se-ries, from 2007 to 2012, where several papers on intrinsic plagiarism detection have been published.",
        "powerful tool for characterizing the writing style (Stamatatos, 2009a).",
        "Moreover, they have been used in one of the best intrinsic plagiarism detection methods (Stamatatos, 2009b).",
        "Generally, in n-gram based methods the text is represented by a vector of n-grams with their frequencies.",
        "The shortcoming of this text representation is the increase of its size with the increase of the text or the n-gram length.",
        "Our method proposes a novel way of using character n-grams 2 for text representation.",
        "The idea is to represent the fragments of the suspicious document in a reduced vector where each feature value is the frequency of a class of n-grams instead of a particular n-gram.",
        "Therefore, the dimension of any fragment vector is always equal to the number of classes rather than the number of n-grams.",
        "The class of an n-gram is determined according to its frequency level in the given document as we will show in the next section.",
        "3 N-gram Classes Formally, we define an n-gram class as a number from 0 to m?1 such that the class labeled 0 involves the least frequent n-grams and the class labeled m?1 contains the most frequent n-grams in a document.",
        "If m > 2, classes between 0 and m?1 will contain n-grams with intermediate frequency levels.",
        "Concretely, to assign the n-grams of a given document to m classes, first, the document is represented by a 2 ?",
        "l matrix (l is the total number of n-grams), where the first row contains the n-grams ngi (i =1..l) and the second one contains their number of occurrences freqi (raw frequen-cy).",
        "Let max_freq denotes the maximum frequen-cy, so: max_freq = argmax freqi ; i=1..l (1) Then, the class of a n-gram ngi is computed as follows: Class ngi = Log base (freq i); (2) Given that: base = ???_????",
        "?",
        "?1 .",
        "(3) By computing the base of the logarithm as shown in the equation (3), the most frequent n-grams (i.e. the n-grams with the maximum number of occurrences) will be in the class m?1, and 2 In the rest of the paper, when not said differently, the term n-gram is always used to denote character n-gram.",
        "1460 the least frequent n-grams (e.g. the ones that appear only once) will be in the class 0, and the n-grams with intermediate levels of frequency will be in the classes between 0 and m?1.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates an example of computing the n-gram classes of a document.",
        "The chosen number of classes m in this example is 3.",
        "Figure 1.",
        "Steps for computing the n-gram classes of a document.",
        "The number of classes in this example is 3 (class labels are from 0 to 2).",
        "Note that, what we explained above is solely how to compute the class of each n-gram of a document.",
        "However, our purpose is to represent the document fragments using these classes.",
        "To this end, for each fragment, first, its n-grams are extracted.",
        "Then, each n-gram is replaced by its class obtained from the document model built previously.",
        "Finally, the proportion of each class in the fragment is computed.",
        "So, the fragment can be represented by a vector of m values, where the first value is the proportion of the class 0, the second value is the proportion of the class 1 and so on.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates these steps.",
        "For the sake of simplicity, we suppose that the fragment contains only 5 n-grams.",
        "Figure 2.",
        "Steps for representing a document fragment by the proportion of 3 n-gram classes.",
        "4 The Proposed Method Once the suspicious document has been segmented to fragments and these latter have been represented by a set of features, an important phase in the process of the intrinsic plagiarism detection is to decide whether a fragment is plagiarized or original.",
        "This phase has been implemented in the literature methods using different techniques, notably clustering (Akiva, 2011), supervised classification (Meyer zu Eissen et al., 2007), distance functions with thresholds (Stamatatos, 2009b; Oberreuter et al., 2011) and density-based methods (Stein et al., 2011).",
        "In our supervised method, the classification model is trained with a small number of features which are the proportions of the n-gram classes described in the previous section.",
        "In detail, our method is composed of the following steps: 1.",
        "Segment each document d into fragments si by using the sliding window technique.",
        "Let S denotes the set of these fragments.",
        "2.",
        "Build the n-gram class document model (see Figure 1) without considering numerals.",
        "We choose to consider the frequency of a n-gram ngi as the number of its occurrence in d such that it is counted once per fragment.",
        "Therefore, the minimum value that could take a frequency is 1 if ngi appears only in one fragment, and its maximum value is |S| (the number of fragments in d) if ngi occurs in each fragment si ?",
        "S. 3.",
        "Represent each fragment si by a vector of m features fj , j ?",
        "{0,?, m?1}.",
        "So that, each fj is the proportion of the n-grams that belong to the class labeled j to the total number of n-grams in si.",
        "4.",
        "Combine into one dataset the fragment vectors obtained from all the training corpus documents.",
        "Then, label each vector with its authenticity state, i.e. plagiarized, if the fragment plagiarism percentage exceeds 50% and original otherwise.",
        "5.",
        "Build a classifier using the training set produced in the previous step.",
        "For this purpose, we trained and tested several classification algorithms implemented on WEKA software (Hall et al., 2009).",
        "The best results were obtained with the Na?ve Bayes algorithm3.",
        "The aforementioned steps represent the training phase of our method, which aims to construct the classifier.",
        "In practice, in order to detect the plagiarism in a given document, this classifier is 3 Consult the arff file from the archive file associated to this paper which contains the fragments class proportion model and the plagiarism prediction for each fragment.",
        "1461 directly applied to the document fragments after the step 3.",
        "5 Evaluation 5.1 Datasets We evaluated our method on 3 corpora: PAN-PC-094 and PAN-PC-115 which are the corpora used in the international competition of plagiarism detection in 2009 and 2011 respectively6, as well as InAra corpus7, which is a publicly available collection of artificial suspicious documents in Arabic (Bensalem et al., 2013).",
        "The three document collections include XML annotations indicating the plagiarized segments positions.",
        "For the evaluation on English and Spanish documents, the classifier has been trained on PAN-PC-11 test corpus and evaluated on this same corpus using 10-fold cross validation as well as PAN-PC-09 test corpus.",
        "For the evaluation on Arabic documents, the classifier has been trained and tested on InAra corpus using 10-fold cross validation.",
        "5.2 Results As evaluation measures we used macro-averaged precision, recall, f-measure, granularity and plagdet as they were defined in (Potthast et al., 2010).",
        "In order to choose the parameters of our me-thod, we trained the classifier using various training sets generated by using the different combinations of the n-gram length n (from 1 to 10) and the number of classes m (from 2 to 10).",
        "We adopted the parameters that yielded the higher f-measure, namely n = 6 and m = 4.",
        "With regard the sliding window parameters, we used three different options for the window size, which are 100, 200 and 400 words, with a step equal to the quarter of the window size.",
        "Only one option is applied to a given document depending on its length.",
        "We deliberately use similar sliding window parameters as the method of Oberreuter et al. 4 http://www.uni-weimar.de/en/media/chairs/webis/research/corpora/corpus- pan-pc-09/ 5 http://www.uni-weimar.de/en/media/chairs/webis/research/corpora/corpus- pan-pc-11/ 6 We used only the corpora parts that are dedicated to the evaluation of the intrinsic approach.",
