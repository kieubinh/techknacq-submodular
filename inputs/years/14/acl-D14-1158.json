        "Language modeling is the task of estimating the probability of sequences of words in a language and is an important component in, among other applications, automatic speech recognition (Ra- biner and Juang, 1993) and machine translation (Koehn, 2010).",
        "The predominant approach to language modeling is the n-gram model, wherein the probability of a word sequence P (w 1 , .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", w ` ) is decomposed using the chain rule, and then a Markov assumption is made: P (w 1 , .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", w ` ) ?",
        "?",
        "` i=1 P (w i |w i?1 i?n+1 ).",
        "While this assumption substantially reduces the modeling complexity, parameter estimation remains a major challenge.",
        "Due to the power-law nature of language (Zipf, 1949), the maximum likelihood estimator massively overestimates the probability of rare events and assigns zero probability to legitimate word sequences that happen not to have been observed in the training data (Manning and Sch?utze, 1999).",
        "Many smoothing techniques have been proposed to address the estimation challenge.",
        "These reassign probability mass (generally from overestimated events) to unseen word sequences, whose probabilities are estimated by interpolating with or backing off to lower order n-gram models (Chen and Goodman, 1999).",
        "Somewhat surprisingly, these widely used smoothing techniques differ substantially from techniques for coping with data sparsity in other domains, such as collaborative filtering (Koren et al., 2009; Su and Khoshgoftaar, 2009) or matrix completion (Cand`es and Recht, 2009; Cai et al., 2010).",
        "In these areas, low rank approaches based on matrix factorization play a central role (Lee and Seung, 2001; Salakhutdinov and Mnih, 2008; Mackey et al., 2011).",
        "For example, in recommender systems, a key challenge is dealing with the sparsity of ratings from a single user, since typical users will have rated only a few items.",
        "By projecting the low rank representation of a user's (sparse) preferences into the original space, an estimate of ratings for new items is obtained.",
        "These methods are attractive due to their computational efficiency and mathematical well-foundedness.",
        "In this paper, we introduce power low rank ensembles (PLRE), in which low rank tensors are used to produce smoothed estimates for n-gram probabilities.",
        "Ideally, we would like the low rank structures to discover semantic and syntactic relatedness among words and n-grams, which are used to produce smoothed estimates for word sequence probabilities.",
        "In contrast to the few previous low rank language modeling approaches, PLRE is not orthogonal to n-gram models, but rather a general framework where existing n-gram smoothing methods such as Kneser-Ney smoothing are special cases.",
        "A key insight is that PLRE does not compute low rank approximations of the original 1487 joint count matrices (in the case of bigrams) or tensors i.e. multi-way arrays (in the case of 3-grams and above), but instead altered quantities of these counts based on an element-wise power operation, similar to how some smoothing methods modify their lower order distributions.",
        "Moreover, PLRE has two key aspects that lead to easy scalability for large corpora and vocabularies.",
        "First, since it utilizes the original n-grams, the ranks required for the low rank matrices and tensors tend to be remain tractable (e.g. around 100 for a vocabulary size V ?",
        "1 ?",
        "10 6 ) leading to fast training times.",
        "This differentiates our approach over other methods that leverage an underlying latent space such as neural networks (Bengio et al., 2003; Mnih and Hinton, 2007; Mikolov et al., 2010) or soft-class models (Saul and Pereira, 1997) where the underlying dimension is required to be quite large to obtain good performance.",
        "Moreover, at test time, the probability of a sequence can be queried in time O(?",
        "max ) where ?",
        "max is the maximum rank of the low rank matri-ces/tensors used.",
        "While this is larger than Kneser Ney's virtually constant query time, it is substantially faster than conditional exponential family models (Chen and Rosenfeld, 2000; Chen, 2009; Nelakanti et al., 2013) and neural networks which require O(V ) for exact computation of the normalization constant.",
        "See Section 7 for a more detailed discussion of related work.",
        "Outline: We first review existing n-gram smoothing methods (?2) and then present the intuition behind the key components of our tech-nique: rank (?3.1) and power (?3.2).",
        "We then show how these can be interpolated into an ensemble (?4).",
        "In the experimental evaluation on English and Russian corpora (?5), we find that PLRE outperforms Kneser-Ney smoothing and all its vari-ants, as well as class-based language models.",
        "We also include a comparison to the log-bilinear neural language model (Mnih and Hinton, 2007) and evaluate performance on a downstream machine translation task (?6) where our method achieves consistent improvements in BLEU.",
        "2 Discount-based Smoothing We first provide background on absolute discounting (Ney et al., 1994) and Kneser-Ney smoothing (Kneser and Ney, 1995), two common n-gram smoothing methods.",
        "Both methods can be formulated as back-off or interpolated models; we describe the latter here since that is the basis of our low rank approach.",
        "2.1 Notation Let c(w) be the count of word w, and similarly c(w,w i?1 ) for the joint count of words w and w i?1 .",
        "For shorthand we will define w j i to denote the word sequence {w i , w i+1 , ..., w j?1 , w j }.",
        "Let ?",
        "P (w i ) refer to the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the probability of word w i , and similarly ?",

        "2.2 Absolute Discounting Absolute discounting works on the idea of interpolating higher order n-gram models with lower-order n-gram models.",
        "However, first some probability mass must be ?subtracted?",
        "from the higher order n-grams so that the leftover probability can be allocated to the lower order n-grams.",

        "3 Power Low Rank Ensembles In n-gram smoothing methods, if a bigram count c(w i , w i?1 ) is zero, the unigram probabilities are used, which is equivalent to assuming that w i and w i?1 are independent ( and similarly for general n).",

        "7 the best score at WMT 2013 was 19.9 (Bojar et al., 2013) 1495 procedure is repeated 10 times to control for optimizer instability (Clark et al., 2011).",
        "Unlike other recent approaches where an additional feature weight is tuned for the proposed model and used in conjunction with KN smoothing (Vaswani et al., 2013), our aim is to show the improvements that PLRE provides as a substitute for KN.",
        "On av-erage, PLRE outperforms the KN baseline by 0.16 BLEU, and this improvement is consistent in that PLRE never gets a worse BLEU score.",
        "7 Related Work Recent attempts to revisit the language modeling problem have largely come from two direc-tions: Bayesian nonparametrics and neural networks.",
        "Teh (2006) and Goldwater et al. (2006) discovered the connection between interpolated Kneser Ney and the hierarchical Pitman-Yor process.",
        "These have led to generalizations that account for domain effects (Wood and Teh, 2009) and unbounded contexts (Wood et al., 2009).",
        "The idea of using neural networks for language modeling is not new (Miikkulainen and Dyer, 1991), but recent efforts (Mnih and Hinton, 2007; Mikolov et al., 2010) have achieved impressive performance.",
        "These methods can be quite expensive to train and query (especially as the vocabulary size increases).",
        "Techniques such as noise contrastive estimation (Gutmann and Hyv?arinen, 2012; Mnih and Teh, 2012; Vaswani et al., 2013), subsampling (Xu et al., 2011), or careful engineering approaches for maximum entropy LMs (which can also be applied to neural networks) (Wu and Khudanpur, 2000) have improved training of these models, but querying the probability of the next word given still requires explicitly normalizing over the vocabulary, which is expensive for big corpora or in languages with a large number of word types.",
        "Mnih and Teh (2012) and Vaswani et al. (2013) propose setting the normalization constant to 1, but this is approximate and thus can only be used for downstream evaluation, not for perplexity computation.",
        "An alternate technique is to use word-classing (Goodman, 2001; Mikolov et al., 2011), which can reduce the cost of exact normalization to O( ?",
        "V ).",
        "In contrast, our approach is much more scalable, since it is trivially parallelized in training and does not require explicit normalization during evaluation.",
        "There are a few low rank approaches (Saul and Pereira, 1997; Bellegarda, 2000; Hutchinson et al., 2011), but they are only effective in restricted settings (e.g. small training sets, or corpora divided into documents) and do not generally perform comparably to state-of-the-art models.",
        "Roark et al. (2013) also use the idea of marginal constraints for re-estimating back-off parameters for heavily-pruned language models, whereas we use this concept to estimate n-gram specific discounts.",
        "8 Conclusion We presented power low rank ensembles, a technique that generalizes existing n-gram smoothing techniques to non-integer n. By using ensembles of sparse as well as low rank matrices and ten-sors, our method captures both the fine-grained and coarse structures in word sequences.",
        "Our discounting strategy preserves the marginal constraint and thus generalizes Kneser Ney, and under slight changes can also extend other smoothing methods such as deleted-interpolation/Jelinek-Mercer smoothing.",
        "Experimentally, PLRE convincingly outperforms Kneser-Ney smoothing as well as class-based baselines.",
