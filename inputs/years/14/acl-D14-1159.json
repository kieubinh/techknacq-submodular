        "Our goal is to tackle a complex reading comprehension setting that centers on understanding the underlying meaning of a process description.",
        "We target a multiple-choice setting in which each input consists of a paragraph of text describing a biological process, a question, and two possible answers.",
        "The goal is to identify the correct answer using the text (Figure 1, left).",
        "We used the 148 paragraphs from the textbook Biology (Campbell and Reece, 2005) that were manually identified by Scaria et al. (2013).",
        "We extended this set to 200 paragraphs by including additional paragraphs that describe biological processes.",
        "Each paragraph in the collection represents a single biological process and describes a set of events, their participants and their interactions.",
        "Because we target understanding of paragraph meaning, we use the following desiderata for building the corpus of questions and answers: 1.",
        "The questions should focus on the events and entities participating in the process described in the paragraph, and answering the questions should require reasoning about the relations between those events and entities.",
        "2.",
        "Both answers should have similar lexical overlap with the paragraph.",
        "Moreover, names of entities and events in the question and answers should appear as in the paragraph and not using synonyms.",
        "This is to ensure that the task revolves around reading comprehension rather than lexical variability.",
        "1 A biologist created the question-answer part of 1 Lexical variability is an important problem in NLP, but is not the focus of this task.",
        "1500 the corpus comprising of 585 questions spread over the 200 paragraphs.",
        "A second annotator validated 326 randomly chosen questions and agreed on the correct answer with the first annotator in 98.1% of cases.",
        "We provide the annotation guidelines in the supplementary material.",
        "Figure 1 (left) shows an excerpt of a paragraph describing a process and an example of a question based on it.",
        "In general, questions test an understanding of the interactions between multiple events (such as causality, inhibition, temporal or-dering), or between events and entities (i.e., roles of entities in events), and require complex reasoning about chains of event-event and event-entity relations.",
        "3 The Structure of Processes A natural first step for answering reading comprehension questions is to identify a structured representation of the text.",
        "In this section, we define this structure.",
        "We broadly follow the definition of Scaria et al. (2013), but modify important aspects, highlighted at the end of this section.",
        "A paragraph describing a process is a sequence of tokens that describes events, entities and their relations (see Figure 1, top right).",
        "A process is a directed graph (T ,A, E tt , E ta ), where the nodes T are labeled event triggers, the nodes A are ar-guments, E tt are labeled edges describing event-event relations, and E ta are labeled edges from triggers to arguments denoting semantic roles (see Figure 1 top right for a partial structure of the running example).",
        "The goal of process extraction is to generate the process graph given the input paragraph.",
        "Triggers and arguments A trigger is a token span denoting the occurrence of an event.",
        "In Figure 1, split, absorbed and transfer are event triggers.",
        "In rare cases, a trigger denotes the non-occurrence of an event.",
        "For example, in ?sym- patric speciation can occur when gene flow is blocked?, sympatric speciation occurs if gene flow does not happen.",
        "Thus, nodes in T are labeled as either a T-YES or T-NO to distinguish triggers of events that occur from triggers of events that do not occur.",
        "Arguments are token spans denoting entities that participate in the process (such as wa-ter, light and ions in Figure 1).",
        "Semantic roles The edges E ta from triggers to arguments are labeled by the semantic roles AGENT, THEME, SOURCE, DESTINATION, LO-CATION, RESULT, and OTHER for all other roles.",
        "Our running example shows three THEME semantic roles for the three triggers.",
        "For brevity, the figure does not show the RESULT of the event split, namely, both source of electrons and protons (hy- drogen ions, H + ) and O 2 .",
        "Event-event relations The directed edges E tt between triggers are labeled by one of eight possible event-event relations.",
        "These relations are central to answering reading comprehension ques-tions, which test understanding of the dependencies and causal relations between the process events.",
        "We first define three relations that express a dependency between two event triggers u and v. 1.",
        "CAUSE denotes that u starts before v, and if u happens then v happens (Figure 1).",
        "2.",
        "ENABLE denotes that u creates conditions necessary for the occurrence of v. This means that u starts before v and v can only happen if u happens (Figure 1).",
        "2 3.",
        "PREVENT denotes that u starts before v and if u happens, then v does not happen.",
        "In processes, events sometimes depend on more than one other event.",
        "For example, in Figure 1 (right top) transfer of ions depends on both water splitting as well as light absorption.",
        "Conversely, in Figure 2, the shifting event results in either one of two events but not both.",
        "To express both conjunctions and disjunctions of related events we add the relations CAUSE-OR, ENABLE-OR and PREVENT-OR, which express disjunctions, while the default CAUSE, ENABLE, and PREVENT express conjunction (Compare the CAUSE-OR relations in Figure 2 with the relations in Figure 1).",
        "We define the SUPER relation to denote that event u is part of event v. (In Figure 2, slippage is a sub-event of replication.)",
        "Last, we use the event coreference relation SAME to denote two event mentions referring to the same event.",
        "Notice that the assignments of relation labels interact across different pairs of events.",
        "As an ex-ample, if event u causes event v, then v can not cause u.",
        "Our inference algorithm uses such structural constraints when predicting process structure (Section 4).",
        "2 In this work, we do not distinguish causation from facil-itation, where u can help v but is not absolutely required.",
        "We instructed the annotators to ignore the inherent uncertainty in these cases and use CAUSE.",
        "1501 Figure 2: Partial example of a process, as annotated in our dataset.",

        "Three biologists annotated the same 200 paragraphs described in Section 2 using the brat annotation tool (Stenetorp et al., 2012).",
        "For each para-graph, one annotator annotated the process, and a second validated its correctness.",
        "Importantly, the questions and answers were authored separately by a different annotator, thus ensuring that the questions and answers are independent from the annotated structures.",
        "Table 1 gives statistics over the dataset.",
        "The annotation guidelines are included in the supplementary material.",
        "Relation to Scaria et al. (2013) Scaria et al. (2013) also defined processes as graphs where nodes are events and edges describe event-event relations.",
        "Our definition differs in a few important aspects.",
        "First, the set of event-event relations in that work included temporal relations in addition to causal ones.",
        "In this work, we posit that because events in a process are inter-related, causal dependencies are sufficient to capture the relevant temporal ordering between them.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates this phenomenon, where the temporal ordering between the events of water splitting and light absorption is unspecified.",
        "It does not matter whether one happens before, during, or after the other.",
        "Fur-thermore, the incoming causal links to transfer imply that the event should happen after splitting and absorption.",
        "A second difference is that Scaria et al. (2013) do not include disjunctions and conjunctions of events in their formulation.",
        "Last, Scaria et al. (2013) predict only relations given input triggers, while we predict a full process structure.",
        "4 Predicting Process Structures We now describe the first step of our algorithm.",
        "Given an input paragraph we predict events, their arguments and event-event relations (Figure 1, top).",
        "We decompose this into three sub-problems: 1.",
        "Labeling trigger candidates using a multi-class classifier (Section 4.1).",
        "2.",
        "For each trigger, identifying an over-complete set of possible arguments, using a classifier tuned for high recall (Section 4.2).",
        "3.",
        "Jointly assigning argument labels and relation labels for all trigger pairs (Section 4.3).",
        "The event-event relations CAUSE, ENABLE, CAUSE-OR and ENABLE-OR, form a semantic cluster: If (u, v) is labeled by one of these, then the occurrence of v depends on the occurrence of u.",
        "Since our dataset is small, we share statistics by collapsing all four labels to a single ENABLE label.",
        "Similarly, we collapse the PREVENT and PREVENT-OR labels, overall reducing the number of relations to four.",
        "For brevity, in what follows we only provide a flavor of the features we extract, and refer the reader to the supplementary material for details.",
        "4.1 Predicting Event Triggers The first step is to identify the events in the process.",
        "We model the trigger detector as a multi-class classifier that labels all content words in the paragraph as one of T-YES, T-NO or NOT-TRIGGER (Recall that a word can trigger an event that occurred, an event that did not occur, or not be a trigger at all).",
        "For simplicity, we model triggers as single words, but in the gold annotation about 14% are phrases (such as gene flow).",
        "Thus, we evaluate trigger prediction by taking heads of gold phrases.",
        "To train the classifier, we extract 1502 the lemma and POS tag of the word and adjacent words, dependency path to the root, POS tag of children and parent in the dependency tree, and clustering features from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), Nomlex (Macleod et al., 1998), Levin verb classes (Levin, 1993), and a list of biological processes compiled from Wikipedia.",
        "4.2 Filtering Argument Candidates Labeling trigger-argument edges is similar to semantic role labeling.",
        "Following the standard approach (Punyakanok et al., 2008), for each trigger we collect all constituents in the same sentence to build an over-complete set of plausible candidate arguments.",
        "This set is pruned with a binary classifier that is tuned for high recall (akin to the argument identifier in SRL systems).",
        "On the development set we filter more than half of the argument candidates, while achieving more than 99% recall.",
        "This classifier is trained using argument identification features from Punyakanok et al. (2008).",
        "At the end of this step, each trigger has a set of candidate arguments which will be labeled during joint inference.",
        "In further discussion, the argument candidates for trigger t are denoted by A t .",
        "4.3 Predicting Arguments and Relations Given the output of the trigger classifier, our goal is to jointly predict event-argument and event-event relations.",
        "We model this as an integer linear program (ILP) instance described below.",
        "We first describe the inference setup assuming a model that scores inference decisions and defer description of learning to Section 4.4.",
        "The ILP has two types of decision variables: arguments and relations.",
        "Argument variables These variables capture the decision that a candidate argument a, belonging to the set A t of argument candidates, takes a label A (from Section 3).",
        "We denote the Boolean variables by y t,a,A , which are assigned a score b t,a,A by the model.",
        "We include an additional label NULL-ARG, indicating that the candidate is not an argument for the trigger.",
        "Event-event relation variables These variables capture the decision that a pair of triggers t 1 and t 2 are connected by a directed edge (t 1 , t 2 ) labeled by the relation R. We denote these variables by z t 1 ,t 2 ,R , which are associated with a score c t 1 ,t 2 ,R .",
        "Again, we introduce a label NULL-REL to indicate triggers that are not connected by an edge.",
        "Name Description Unique labels Every argument candidate and trigger pair has exactly one label.",
        "Argument overlap Two arguments of the same trigger cannot overlap.",
        "Relation symmetry The SAME relation is symmetric.",
        "All other relations are anti-symmetric, i.e., for any relation label other than SAME, at most one of (t i , t j ) or (t j , t i ) can take that label and the other is assigned the label NULL-REL.",
        "Max arguments per trigger Every trigger can have no more than two arguments with the same label.",
        "Max triggers per argument The same span of text can not be an argument for more than two triggers.",
        "Connectivity The triggers must form a connected graph, framed as flow constraints as in Magnanti and Wolsey (1995) and Martins et al. (2009).",
        "Shared arguments If the same span of text is an argument of two trig-gers, then the triggers must be connected by a relation that is not NULL-REL.",
        "This ensures that triggers that share arguments are related.",
        "Unique parent For any trigger, at most one outgoing edge can be labeled SUPER.",
        "Table 2: Constraints for joint inference.",
        "Formulation Given the two sets of variables, the objective of inference is to find a global assignment that maximizes the score.",
        "That is, the objective can be stated as follows: max y,z ?",
        "t,a?A t ,A b t,a,A ?",
        "y t,a,A + ?",
        "t 1 ,t 2 ,R c t 1 ,t 2 ,R ?",
        "z t 1 ,t 2 ,R Here, y and z refer to all the argument and relation variables respectively.",
        "Clearly, all possible assignments to the inference variables are not feasible and there are both structural as well as prior knowledge constraints over the output space.",
        "Table 2 states the constraints we include, which are expressed as linear inequalities over output variables using standard techniques (e.g., (Roth and Yih, 2004)).",
        "4.4 Learning in the Joint Model We train both the trigger classifier and the argument identifier using L 2 -regularized logistic regression.",
        "For the joint model, we use a linear model for the scoring functions, and train jointly using the structured averaged perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002).",
        "Since argument labeling is similar to semantic role labeling (SRL), we extract standard SRL features given the trigger and argument from the syntactic tree for the corresponding sentence.",
        "In ad-dition, we add features extracted from an off-the-shelf SRL system.",
        "We also include all feature conjunctions.",
        "For event relations, we include the features described in Scaria et al. (2013), as well as context features for both triggers, and the dependency path between them, if one exists.",
        "1503 5 Question Answering via Structures This section describes our question answering system that, given a process structure, a question and two answers, chooses the correct answer (steps 2 and 3 in Figure 1).",
        "Our strategy is to treat the process structure as a small knowledge-base.",
        "We map each answer along with the question into a structured query that we compare against the structure.",
        "The query can prove either the correctness or incorrectness of the answer being considered.",
        "That is, either we get a valid match for an answer (proving that the corresponding answer is correct), or we get a refutation in the form of a contradicted causal chain (thus proving that the other answer is correct).",
        "This is similar to theorem proving approaches suggested in the past for factoid question answering (Moldovan et al., 2003).",
        "The rest of this section is divided into three parts: Section 5.1 defines the queries we use, Section 5.2 describes a rule-based algorithm for converting a question and an answer into a query and finally, 5.3 describes the overall algorithm.",
        "5.1 Queries over Processes We model a query as a directed graph path with regular expressions over edge labels.",
        "The bottom right portion of Figure 1 shows examples of queries for our running example.",
        "In general, given a question and one of the answer candidates, one end of the path is populated by a trigger/argument found in the question and the other is populated with a trigger/ argument from the answer.",
        "We define a query to consist of three parts: 1.",
        "A regular expression over relation labels, describing permissible paths, 2.",
        "A source trigger/argument node, and 3.",
        "A target trigger/argument node.",
        "For example, the bottom query in Figure 1 looks for paths labeled with CAUSE or ENABLE edges from the event split to the event transfer.",
        "Note that the representation of questions as directed paths is a modeling choice and did not influence the authoring of the questions.",
        "Indeed, while most questions do fit this model, there are rare cases that require a more complex query structure.",
        "5.2 Query Generation Mapping a question and an answer into a query involves identifying the components of the query listed above.",
        "We do this in two phases: (1) In the alignment phase, we align triggers and arguments in the question and answer to the process structure to give us candidate source and target nodes.",
        "(2) In the query construction phase, we identify the regular expression and the direction of the query using the question, the answer and the alignment.",
        "We identify three broad categories of QA pairs (see Table 3) that can be identified using simple lexical rules: (a) Dependency questions ask which event or argument depends on another event or ar-gument, (b) Temporal questions ask about temporal ordering of events, and (c) True-false questions ask whether some fact is true.",
        "Below, we describe the two phases of query generation primarily in the context of dependency questions with a brief discussion about temporal and true-false questions at the end of the section.",
        "Alignment Phase We align triggers in the structure to the question and the answer by matching lemmas or nominalizations.",
        "In case of multiple matches, we use the context to disambiguate and resolve ties using the highest matching candidate in the syntactic dependency tree.",
        "We align arguments in the question and the answer in a similar manner.",
        "Since arguments are typically several words long, we prefer maximal spans.",
        "Additionally, if a question (or an answer) contains an aligned trigger, we prefer to align words to its arguments.",
        "Query Construction Phase We construct a query using the aligned question and answer trig-gers/arguments.",
        "We will explain query construction using our running example (reproduced as the dependency question in Table 3).",
        "First, we identify the source and the target of the query.",
        "We select either the source or the target to be a question node and populate the other end of the query path with an answer node.",
        "To make the choice between source or target for the question node, we use the main verb in the ques-tion, its voice and relative position of the question word with respect to the main verb.",
        "In our exam-ple, the main verb lead to is in active voice and the question word what is not in subject position.",
        "This places the trigger from the question as the source of the query path (see both queries in the bottom right portion of the running example).",
        "In contrast, had the verb been require, the trigger would be the target of the query.",

        "In fact, guessing the answer with higher lexical overlap results in performance that is slightly lower than random.",

        "questions we must determine given a single statement whether it holds.",

        "5 6.3 Structure Prediction Task Our evaluation demonstrates that gold structures improve accuracy substantially more than predicted structures.",
        "To examine this, we now directly evaluate the structure predictor by comparing micro-average precision, recall and F 1 between predicted and gold structures (Table 5).",
        "While performance for trigger identification is reasonable, performance on argument and relation prediction is low.",
        "This explains the higher performance obtained in reading comprehension given gold structures.",
        "Note that errors in trigger prediction propagate to argument and relation prediction ?",
        "a relation cannot be predicted correctly if either one of the related triggers is not previously identified.",
        "One reason for low performance is the small size of the dataset.",
        "Thus, training process predictors with less supervision is an important direction for future work.",
        "Furthermore, the task of process prediction is inherently difficult, because often relations are expressed only indirectly in text.",
        "For example, in Figure 1 the relation between water splitting and transfer of ions is only recoverable by understanding that water provides the ions that need to be transferred.",
        "Nevertheless, we find that questions can often be answered correctly even if the structure contains some errors.",
        "For example, the gold structure for the sentence ?Some .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "radioisotopes have long half-lives, allowing .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "?, contains the trigger long half-lives, while we predict have as a trigger and long half-lives as an argument.",
        "This is good enough to answer questions related to this part of the structure correctly, and overall, to improve performance using predicted structures.",
        "5 The low performance of TEXTPROX and SYNTPROX on true-false questions can also be attributed to the fact that we tuned a threshold parameter on the training set, and this did not generalize well to the test set.",
        "Reason GOLD PROREAD Alignment 35% 15% Missing from annotation 25% 10% Entity coreference 20% 10% Missing regular expression 10% Lexical variability 5% 10% Error in predicted structure 55% Other 5% Table 6: Error analysis results.",
        "An explanation of the various categories are in the body of the paper.",
        "6.4 Error Analysis This section presents the results of an analysis of 20 sampled errors of GOLD (gold structures), and 20 errors of PROREAD (predicted structures).",
        "We have categorized the primary reason for error in Table 6.",
        "As expected, the main problem when using predicted structures, is structure errors which account for more than half of the errors.",
        "Errors in GOLD are distributed across various categories, which we briefly describe.",
        "Alignment errors occur due to multiple words aligning to multiple triggers and arguments.",
        "For example, in the question ?What is the result of gases being produced in the lysosome?",
        "?, the answer ?engulfed pathogens are poisoned?",
        "is incorrectly aligned to the trigger engulfed rather than to poisoned.",
        "Another reason for errors are cases where questions are asked about parts of the paragraph that are missing from annotation.",
        "This is possible since questions were authored independently of structure annotation.",
        "Two other causes for errors are entity coreference errors, where a referent for an entity is missing from the structure, and lexical variability, where the author of questions uses names for triggers or arguments that are missing from the paragraph, and so alignment fails.",
        "Last, in 10% of the cases in GOLD we found that the answer could not be retrieved using the set of regular expressions that are currently used by our QA system.",
        "7 Discussion This work touches on several strands of work in NLP including information extraction, semantic role labeling, semantic parsing and reading comprehension.",
        "Event and relation extraction have been studied via the ACE data (Doddington et al., 2004) and related work.",
        "The BioNLP shared tasks (Kim et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2011; Riedel and McCal-1507 lum, 2011) focused on biomedical data to extract events and their arguments.",
        "Event-event relations have been mostly studied from the perspective of temporal ordering; e.g., (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008; Yoshikawa et al., 2009; Do et al., 2012; Mc-Closky and Manning, 2012).",
        "The process structure predicted in this work differs from these lines of work in two important ways: First, we predict events, arguments and their interactions from multiple sentences, while most earlier work focused on one or two of these components.",
        "Second, we model processes, and thus target causal relations between events, rather than temporal order only.",
        "Our semantic role annotation is similar to existing SRL schemes such as PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005), FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al., 2006) and BioProp (Chou et al., 2006).",
        "However, in contrast to PropBank and FrameNet, we do not allow all verbs to trigger events and instead let the annotators decide on biologically important triggers, which are not restricted to verbs (unlike BioProp, where 30 pre-specified verbs were selected for an-notation).",
        "Like PropBank and BioProp, the argument labels are not trigger specific.",
        "Mapping questions to queries is effectively a semantic parsing task.",
        "In recent years, several lines of work addressed semantic parsing using various formalisms and levels of supervision (Zettle- moyer and Collins, 2005; Wong and Mooney, 2006; Clarke et al., 2010; Berant et al., 2013).",
        "In particular, Krishnamurthy and Kollar (2013) learned to map natural language utterances to referents in an image by constructing a KB from the image and then mapping the utterance to a query over the KB.",
        "This is analogous to our process of constructing a process structure and performing QA by querying that structure.",
        "In our work, we parse questions into graph-based queries, suitable for modeling processes, using a rule-based heuristic.",
        "Training a statistical semantic parser that will replace the QA system is an interesting direction for future research.",
        "Multiple choice reading comprehension tests are a natural choice for evaluating machine reading.",
