        "In recent years, vector space models (VSMs) have been proved successful in solving various NLP tasks including named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, parsing, semantic role-labeling and answering synonym or analogy questions (Turney et al., 2010; Collobert et al., 2011).",
        "Also, VSMs are reported performing well on tasks involving the measurement of word relatedness (Turney et al., 2010).",
        "Many existing works are distributional models, based on the Distributional Hypothesis, that words occurring in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings (Har- ris, 1954).",
        "The limitation is that word vectors developed from distributional models cannot reveal word relatedness if its information does not lie in word distributions.",
        "For instance, they are believed to have difficulty distinguishing antonyms from synonyms, because the distribution of antonymous words are close, since the context of antonymous words are always similar to each other (Moham- mad et al., 2013).",
        "Although some research claims that in certain conditions there do exist differences between the contexts of different antonymous words (Scheible et al., 2013), the differences are subtle enough that it can hardly be detected by such language models, especially for rare words.",
        "Another important class of lexical resource for word relatedness is a lexicon, such as WordNet (Miller, 1995) or Roget's Thesaurus (Kipfer, 2009).",
        "Manually producing or extending lexicons is much more labor intensive than generating VSM word vectors using a corpus.",
        "Thus, lexicons are sparse with missing words and multi-word terms as well as missing relationships between words.",
        "Considering the synonym / antonym perspective as an example, WordNet answers less than 40% percent of the the GRE antonym questions provided by Mohammad et al. (2008) directly.",
        "Moreover, binary entries in lexicons do not indicate the degree of relatedness, such as the degree of lexical contrast between happy and sad or happy and depressed.",
        "The lack of such information makes it less fruitful when adopted in NLP applications.",
        "In this work, we propose a Bayesian tensor factorization model (BPTF) for synthesizing a composite word vector representation by combining multiple different sources of word relatedness.",
        "The input is a set of word by word matrices, which may be sparse, providing a number indicating the presence or degree of relatedness.",
        "We treat word relatedness matrices from different perspectives as slices, forming a word relatedness tensor.",
        "Then the composite word vectors can be efficiently obtained by performing BPTF.",
        "Furthermore, given any two words and any trained relatedness perspective, we 1522 can create or recreate the pair-wise word relatedness with regularization via per-perspective linear transformation.",
        "This method allows one set of word vectors to represent word relatednesses from many different perspectives (e.g. LSA for topic relatedness / corpus occurrences, ISA relation and YAGO type) It is able to bring the advantages from both word relatedness calculated by distributional models, and manually created lexicons, since the former have much more vocabulary coverage and many varia-tions, while the latter covers word relatedness that is hard to detect by distributional models.",
        "We can use information from distributional perspectives to create (if does not exist) or re-create (with regular-ization) word relatedness from the lexicon's perspective.",
        "We evaluate our model on distinguishing synonyms and antonyms.",
        "There are a number of related works (Lin and Zhao, 2003; Turney, 2008; Mohammad et al., 2008; Mohammad et al., 2013; Yih et al., 2012; Chang et al., 2013).",
        "A number of sophisticated methods have been applied, producing competitive results using diverse approaches.",
        "We use the GRE antonym questions (Mohammad et al., 2008) as a benchmark, and answer these questions by finding the most contrasting choice according to the created or recreated synonym / antonym word relatedness.",
        "The result achieves state-of-the-art performance.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the related work of word vector representations, the BPTF model and antonymy detection.",
        "Section 3 presents our BPTF model and the sampling method.",
        "Section 4 shows the experimental evaluation and results with Section 5 providing conclusion and future work.",
        "2 Related Work 2.1 Word Vector Representations Vector space models of semantics have a long history as part of NLP technologies.",
        "One widely-used method is deriving word vectors using latent semantic analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al., 1990), for measuring word similarities.",
        "This provides a topic based perspective on word similarity.",
        "In recent years, neural word embeddings have proved very effective in improving various NLP tasks (e.g. part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition and semantic role label-ing) (Collobert et al., 2011).",
        "The proposed neural models have a large number of variations, such as feed-forward networks (Bengio et al., 2003), hierarchical models (Mnih and Hinton, 2008), recurrent neural networks (Mikolov, 2012), and recursive neural networks (Socher et al., 2011).",
        "Mikolov et al. (2013) reported their vector-space word representation is able to reveal linguistic regularities and composite semantics using simple vector addition and subtraction.",
        "For example, ?King?Man+Woman?",
        "results in a vector very close to ?Queen?.",
        "Luong et al. (2013) proposed a recursive neural networks model incorporating morphological structure, and has better performance for rare words.",
        "Some non-VSM models 1 also generate word vector representations.",
        "Yih et al. (2012) apply polarity inducing latent semantic analysis (PILSA) to a thesaurus to derive the embedding of words.",
        "They treat each entry of a thesaurus as a document giving synonyms positive term counts, and antonyms negative term counts, and preform LSA on the signed TF-IDF matrix In this way, synonyms will have cosine similarities close to one and antonyms close to minus one.",
        "Chang et al. (2013) further introduced Multi-Relational LSA (MRLSA), as as extension of LSA, that performs Tucker decomposition over a three-way tensor consisting of multiple relations (document-term like matrix) between words as slices, to capture lexical semantics.",
        "The purposes of MRLSA and our model are similar, but the different factorization techniques offer different advantages.",
        "In MRLSA, the k-th slice of tensor W is approximated by W :,:,k ?",
        "X :,:,k = US :,:,k V T , where U and V are both for the same word list but are not guaranteed (or necessarily desired) to be the same.",
        "Thus, this model has the ability to capture asymmetric relations, but this flexibility is a detriment for symmetric relatedness.",
        "In order to expand word relatedness coverage, MRLSA needs to choose a pivot slice (e.g. the synonym slice), thus there always must existence such a slice, and the model performance depends on the quality of this pivot slice.",
        "Also, while non-completeness is a pervasive issue in manually created lexicons, MRLSA is not flexible enough to treat the unknown entries as missing.",
        "Instead it just sets them 1 As defined by Turney et al. (2010), VSM must be derived from event frequencies.",
        "1523 to zero at the beginning and uses the pivot slice to re-calculate them.",
        "In contrast, our method of BPTF is well suited to symmetric relations with many unknown relatedness entries.",
        "2.2 BPTF Model Salakhutdinov and Mnih (2008) introduced a Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (BPMF) model as a collaborative filtering algorithm.",
        "Xiong et al. (2010) proposed a Bayesian Probabilistic Tensor Factorization (BPTF) model which further extended the original model to incorporate temporal factors.",
        "They modeled latent feature vector for users and items, both can be trained efficiently using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, and they obtained competitive results when applying their models on real-world recommendation data sets.",
        "2.3 Antonomy Detection There are a number of previous works in detecting antonymy.",
        "Lin and Zhao (2003) identifies antonyms by looking for pre-identified phrases in corpus datasets.",
        "Turney (2008) proposed a supervised classification method for handling analo-gies, then apply it to antonyms by transforming antonym pairs into analogy relations.",
        "Mohammad et al. (Mohammad et al., 2008; Mohammad et al., 2013) proposed empirical approaches considering corpus co-occurrence statistics and the structure of a published thesaurus.",
        "Based on the assumption that the strongly related words of two words in a contrasting pair are also often antony-mous, they use affix patterns (e.g.",
        "?un-?, ?in-?",
        "and ?im-?)",
        "and a thesaurus as seed sets to add contrast links between word categories.",
        "Their best performance is achieved by further manually annotating contrasting adjacent categories.",
        "This approach relies on the Contrast Hypothesis, which will increase false positives even with a carefully designed methodology.",
        "Furthermore, while this approach can expand contrast relationships in a lexicon, out-of-vocabulary words still pose a sub-stancial challenge.",
        "Yih et al. (2012) and Chang et al. (2013) also applied their vectors on antonymy detection, and Yih et al. achieves the state-of-the-art performance in answering GRE antonym questions.",
        "In addition to the word vectors generated from PILSA, they use morphology and k-nearest neighbors from distributional word vector spaces to derive the embeddings for out-of-vocabulary words.",
        "The latter is problematic since both synonyms and antonyms are distributionally similar.",
        "Their approach is two stage: polarity inducing LSA from a manually created thesaurus, then falling back to morphology and distributional similarity when the lexicon lacks coverage.",
        "In contrast, we focus on fusing the information from thesauruses and automatically induced word relatedness measures during the word vector space creation.",
        "Then prediction is done in a single stage, from the latent vectors capturing all word relatedness perspectives and the appropriate per-perspective transformation vector.",
        "3 Methods 3.1 The Bayesian Probabilistic Tensor Factorization Model Our model is a variation of the BPMF model (Salakhutdinov and Mnih, 2008), and is similar to the temporal BPTF model (Xiong et al., 2010).",
        "To model word relatedness from multiple perspec-tives, we denote the relatedness between word i and word j from perspective k as R k ij .",
        "Then we can organize these similarities to form a three-way tensor R ?",
        "R N?N?K .",
        "Table 1 shows an example, the first slice of the tensor is a N ?",
        "N matrix consists of 1/-1 corresponding to the synonym/antonym entries in the Roget's thesaurus, and the second slice is aN?N matrix consists of the cosine similarity from neural word embeddings created by Luong et al. (2013), where N is the number of words in the vocabulary.",
        "Note that in our model the entries missing in Table 1a do not necessarily need to be treated as zero.",
        "Here we use the indicator variable I k ij to denote if the entry R k ij exists (I k ij = 1) or not (I k ij = 0).",
        "If K = 1, the BPTF model becomes to BPMF.",
        "Hence the key difference between BPTF and BPMF is that the former combines multiple complementary word relatedness perspectives, while the later only smooths and generalizes over one.",
        "We assume the relatedness R k ij to be Gaussian, and can be expressed as the inner-product of three D-dimensional latent vectors: R k ij |V i , V j , P k ?",

        "In order to be able to compare with previous works, we follow the widely-used GRE test dataset provided by (Mohammad et al., 2008), which has a development set (consisting of 162 questions) and a test set (consisting of 950 ques-tions).",
        "The GRE test is a good benchmark because the words are relatively rare (19% of the words in Mohammad's test are not in the top 50,000 most frequent words from Google Books (Goldberg and Orwant, 2013)), thus it is hard to lookup answers from a thesaurus directly with high recall.",
        "Below is an example of the GRE antonym question: adulterate: a. renounce b. forbid c. purify d. criticize e. correct The goal is to choose the most opposite word from the target, here the correct answer is purify.",
        "4.2 Data Resources In our tensor model, the first slice (k = 1) consists of synonyms and antonyms from public the-sauruses, and the second slice (k = 2) consists of cosine similarities from neural word embeddings (example in Table 1) 4.2.1 Thesaurus Two popular thesauruses used in other research are the Macquarie Thesaurus and the Encarta Thesaurus.",
        "Unfortunately, their electronic versions are not publicly available.",
        "In this work we use two alternatives: WordNet Words in WordNet (version 3.0) are grouped into sense-disambiguated synonym sets (synsets), and synsets have links between each other to express conceptual relations.",
        "Previous works reported very different look-up performance using WordNet (Mohammad et al., 2008; Yih et al., 2012), we consider this difference as different understanding of the WordNet structure.",

        "This state-of-the-art performance is achieved with the help of a neural network for fine tuning and multiple schemes of out-of-vocabulary embed-ding, while our method has inherent and straightforward ?out-of-vocabulary embedding?.",
        "While MRLSA, which has this character as well, only has a recall 77% when combining WordNet and Encarta together.",

        "Combining WordNet and Roget's together can improve the look-up performance further to 59% precision and 51% recall (still not as good as Encarta look-up).",
        "Notably, if we strictly follow our BPTF approach but only use the synonym & antonym slice (i.e. a matrix factorization model instead of tensor factorization model), this single-slice model BPMF has performance that is only slightly better than look-up.",
        "Meanwhile Figure 1 shows the convergence curves of BPMF and BPTF.",
        "BPMF actually has lower MAE after convergence.",

        "Instead of focusing on one-slice training data, our model fills the missing entries with the help of inter-slice relations.",
        "We also experimented with a linear metric learning method over the generated word vectors (to learn a metric matrix A to measure the word relatedness via V T i AV j ) using L-BFGS.",
        "By optimizing the mean square error on the synonym & antonym slice, we can reduce 8% of the mean square error on a held out test set, and improve the F-score by roughly 0.5% (of a single iteration).",
        "Although this method doesn't give a significant improvement, it is general and has the potential to boost the performance in other scenarios.",
        "5 Conclusion In this work, we propose a method to map words into a metric space automatically using thesaurus data, previous vector space models, or other word relatedness matrices as input, which is capable of handling out-of-vocabulary words of any particular perspective.",
        "This allows us to derive the relatedness of any given word pair and any perspective by the embedded word vectors with per-perspective linear transformation.",
        "We evaluated the word embeddings with GRE antonym ques-tions, and the result achieves the state-of-the-art performance.",
        "For future works, we will extend the model and its applications in three main directions.",
        "First, in this model we only use a three-way tensor with two slices, while more relations may be able to add into it directly.",
        "Possible additional perspective slices include LSA for topic relatedness, and corpus occurrences in engineered or induced semantic patterns.",
        "Second, we will apply the method to other tasks that require completing a word relatedness matrix.",
        "We evaluated the performance of our model on 1529 creating / recreating one perspective of word re-latedness: antonymy.",
        "Perhaps using vectors generated from many kinds of perspectives would improve the performance on other NLP tasks, such as term matching employed by textual entailment and machine translation metrics.",
        "Third, if our model does learn the relation between semantic similarities and distributional sim-ilarities, there may be fruitful information contained in the vectors V i and P k that can be explored.",
        "One straight-forward idea is that the dot product of perspective vectors P k ?",
        "P l should be a measurement of correlation between perspectives.",
        "Also, a straightforward adaptation of our model has the potential ability to capture asymmetric word relatedness as well, by using a per-perspective matrix instead of vector for the asymmetric slices (i.e. use V T i A k V j instead of ?",
        "D d=1 V (d) i P (d) k V (d) j for calculating word related-ness, where A k is a square matrix).",
