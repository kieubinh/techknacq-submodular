        "Following this new paradigm, we propose a tensor decomposition approach for knowledge base embedding that is highly scalable, and is especially suitable for relation extraction.",
        "By leveraging relational domain knowledge about entity type information, our learning algorithm is significantly faster than previous approaches and is better able to discover new relations missing from the database.",
        "In addition, when applied to a relation extraction task, our approach alone is comparable to several existing systems, and improves the weighted mean average precision of a state-of-the-art method by 10 points when used as a subcomponent."

        "Identifying the relationship between entities from free text, relation extraction is a key task for acquiring new facts to increase the coverage of a structured knowledge base.",
        "Given a pre-defined database schema, traditional relation extraction approaches focus on learning a classifier using textual data alone, such as patterns between the occurrences of two entities in documents, to determine whether the entities have a particular relation.",
        "Other than using the existing known facts to label the text corpora in a distant supervision setting (Bunescu and Mooney, 2007; Mintz et al., ?",
        "Work conducted while interning at Microsoft Research.",
        "2009; Riedel et al., 2010; Ritter et al., 2013), an existing knowledge base is typically not involved in the process of relation extraction.",
        "However, this paradigm has started to shift re-cently, as researchers showed that by taking existing facts of a knowledge base as an integral part of relation extraction, the model can leverage richer information and thus yields better performance.",
        "For instance, Riedel et al. (2013) borrowed the idea of collective filtering and constructed a matrix where each row is a pair of entities and each column is a particular relation.",
        "For a true entity-relation triple (e 1 , r, e 2 ), either from the text corpus or from the knowledge base, the corresponding entry in the matrix is 1.",
        "A previously unknown fact (i.e., triple) can be discovered through matrix decomposition.",
        "This approach can be viewed as creating vector representations of each relation and candidate pair of entities.",
        "Because each entity does not have its own representation, relationships of any unpaired entities cannot be discovered.",
        "Al-ternatively, Weston et al. (2013) created two types of embedding ?",
        "one based on textual similarity and the other based on knowledge base, where the latter maps each entity and relation to the same d-dimensional vector space using a model proposed by Bordes et al. (2013a).",
        "They also showed that combining these two models results in a significant improvement over the model trained using only textual data.",
        "To make such an integrated strategy work, it is important to capture all existing entities and rela-tions, as well as the known facts, from both textual data and large databases.",
        "In this paper, we propose a new knowledge base embedding model, TRESCAL, that is highly efficient and scalable, with relation extraction as our target application.",
        "Our work is built on top of RESCAL (Nickel et al., 2011), which is a tensor decomposition method that has proven its scalability by factoring YAGO (Biega et al., 2013) with 3 million entities 1568 and 41 million triples (Nickel et al., 2012).",
        "We improve the tensor decomposition model with two technical innovations.",
        "First, we exclude the triples that do not satisfy the relational constraints (e.g., both arguments of the relation spouse-of need to be person entities) from the loss, which is done by selecting sub-matrices of each slice of the tensor during training.",
        "Second, we introduce a mathematical technique that significantly reduces the computational complexity in both time and space when the loss function contains a regularization term.",
        "As a consequence, our method is more than four times faster than RESCAL, and is also more accurate in discovering unseen triples.",
        "Our contributions are twofold.",
        "First, compared to other knowledge base embedding methods developed more recently, it is much more efficient to train our model.",
        "As will be seen in Sec.",
        "5, when applied to a large knowledge base created using NELL (Carlson et al., 2010) that has 1.8M entity-relation triples, our method finishes training in 4 to 5 hours, while an alternative method (Bor- des et al., 2013a) needs almost 3 days.",
        "Moreover, the prediction accuracy of our model is competitive to others, if not higher.",
        "Second, to validate its value to relation extraction, we apply TRESCAL to extracting relations from a free text corpus along with a knowledge base, using the data provided in (Riedel et al., 2013).",
        "We show that TRESCAL is complementary to existing systems and significantly improves their performance when using it as a subcomponent.",
        "For instance, this strategy improves the weighted mean average precision of the best approach in (Riedel et al., 2013) by 10 points (47% to 57%).",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "We survey most related work in Sec.",

        "2 Related Work Our approach of creating knowledge base embedding is based on tensor decomposition, which is a well-developed mathematical tool for data analysis.",
        "Existing tensor decomposition models can be categorized into two main families: the CP and Tucker decompositions.",
        "The CP (CAN- DECOMP/PARAFAC) decomposition (Kruskal, 1977; Kiers, 2000) approximates a tensor by a sum of rank-one tensors, while the Tucker decomposition (Tucker, 1966), also known as high-order SVD (De Lathauwer et al., 2000), factorizes a tensor into a core tensor multiplied by a matrix along each dimension.",
        "A highly scalable distributional algorithm using the Map-Reduce architecture has been proposed recently for computing CP (Kang et al., 2012), but not for the Tucker decomposition, probably due to its inherently more complicated model form.",
        "Matrix and tensor decomposition methods have been applied to modeling multi-relational data.",
        "For instance, Speer et al. (2008) aimed to create vectors of latent components for representing concepts in a common sense knowledge base using SVD.",
        "Franz et al. (2009) proposed TripleRank to model the subject-predicate-object RDF triples in a tensor, and then applied the CP decomposition to identify hidden triples.",
        "Following the same tensor encoding, Nickel et al. (2011) proposed RESCAL, a restricted form of Tucker decomposition for discovering previously unknown triples in a knowledge base, and later demonstrated its scalability by applying it to YAGO, which was encoded in a 3M ?",
        "3M ?",
        "38 tensor with 41M triples (Nickel et al., 2012).",
        "Methods that revise the objective function based on additional domain information have been proposed, such as MrWTD, a multi-relational weighted tensor decomposition method (London et al., 2013), coupled matrix and tensor factorization (Papalexakis et al., 2014), and collective matrix factorization (Singh and Gordon, 2008).",
        "Alternatively, instead of optimizing for the least-squares reconduction loss, a non-parametric Bayesian approach for 3-way tensor decomposition for modeling relational data has also been proposed (Sutskever et al., 2009).",
        "Despite the existence of a wide variety of tensor decomposition models, most methods do not scale well and have only been tested on datasets that are much smaller than the size of real-world knowledge bases.",
        "Multi-relational data can be modeled by neural-network methods as well.",
        "For instance, Bordes et al. (2013b) proposed the Semantic Matching Energy model (SME), which aims to have the same d-dimensional vector representations for both entities and relations.",

        "The score of (e 1 , r, e 2 ) is determined by the inner product 1569 of the vectors of (e 1 , r) and (e 2 , r).",
        "Later, they proposed a more scalable method called translating embeddings (TransE) (Bordes et al., 2013a).",

(2013) proposed a Neural Tensor Network (NTN) that represents entities in d-dimensional vectors created separately by averaging pre-trained word vectors, and then learns a d?d?m tensor describing the interactions between these latent components in each of the m relations.",
