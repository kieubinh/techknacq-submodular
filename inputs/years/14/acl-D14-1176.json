        "In statistical machine translation (SMT) reordering (also called distortion) refers to the order in which source words are translated to generate the translation in the target language.",
        "Word orders can differ significantly across languages.",
        "For in-stance, Arabic declarative sentences can be verb-initial, while the corresponding English translation should realize the verb after the subject, hence requiring a reordering.",
        "Determining the correct reordering during decoding is a major challenge for SMT.",
        "This problem has received a lot of attention in the literature (see, e.g., Tillmann (2004), Zens and Ney (2003), Al-Onaizan and Papineni (2006)), as choosing the correct reordering improves readability of the translation and can have a substantial impact on translation quality (Birch, 2011).",
        "In this paper, we only consider those approaches that include a reordering feature function into the log-linear interpolation used during decoding.",
        "The simplest reordering model is linear distortion (Koehn et al., 2003) which scores the distance between phrases translated at steps t and t + 1 of the derivation.",
        "This model ignores any contextual information, as the distance between translated phrases is its only parameter.",
        "Lexical distortion modeling (Tillmann, 2004) conditions reordering probabilities on the phrase pairs translated at the current and previous steps.",
        "Unlike linear distortion, it characterizes reordering not in terms of distance but type: monotone, swap, or discontinuous.",
        "In this paper, we base our approach to reordering on bilingual language models (Marino et al., 2006; Niehues et al., 2011).",
        "Instead of directly characterizing reordering, they model sequences of elementary translation events as a Markov process.",
        "1 Originally, Marino et al. (2006) used this kind of model as the translation model, while more recently it has been used as an additional model in PBSMT systems (Niehues et al., 2011).",
        "We adopt and generalize the approach of Niehues et al. (2011) to investigate several variations of bilingual language models.",
        "Our method consists of labeling elementary translation events (tokens of bilingual LMs) with their different contextual properties.",
        "What kind of contextual information should be incorporated in a reordering model?",
        "Lexical information has been used by Tillmann (2004) but is known to suffer from data sparsity (Galley and Manning, 2008).",
        "Also previous contributions to bilingual language modeling (Marino et al., 2006; Niehues et al., 2011) have mostly used lexical information, although Crego and Yvon (2010a) and Crego and Yvon (2010b) label bilingual to-1 Note that the standard PBSMT translation model assumes that events of translating separate phrases in a sentence are independent.",
        "1689 kens with a rich set of POS tags.",
        "But in gen-eral, reordering is considered to be a syntactic phenomenon and thus the relevant features are syntactic (Fox, 2002; Cherry, 2008).",
        "Syntactic information is incorporated in tree-based approaches in SMT, allowing one to provide a more detailed definition of translation events and to redefine decoding as parsing of a source string (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006; Marton and Resnik, 2008), of a target string (Shen et al., 2008), or both (Chiang, 2007; Chiang, 2010).",
        "Reordering is a result of a given derivation, and CYK-based decoding used in tree-based approaches is more syntax-aware than the simple PBSMT decoding algorithm.",
        "Although tree-based approaches potentially offer a more accurate model of translation, they are also a lot more complex and requiring more intricate optimization and estimation techniques (Huang and Mi, 2010).",
        "Our idea is to keep the simplicity of PBSMT but move towards the expressiveness typical of tree-based models.",
        "We incrementally build up the syntactic representation of a translation during decoding by adding precomputed fragments from the source parse tree.",
        "The idea to combine the merits of the two SMT paradigms has been proposed before, where Huang and Mi (2010) introduce incremental decoding for a tree-based model.",
        "On a very general level, our approach is similar to theirs in that it keeps track of a sequence of source syntactic subtrees that are being translated at consecutive decoding steps.",
        "An important difference is that they keep track of whether the visited subtrees have been fully translated, while in our approach, once a syntactic structural unit has been added to the history, it is not updated anymore.",
        "In this paper, we focus on source syntactic information.",
        "During decoding we have full access to the source sentence, which allows us to obtain a better syntactic analysis (than for a partial sen-tence) and to precompute the units that the model operates with.",
        "We investigate the following research questions: How well can we capture reordering regularities of a language pair by incorporating source syntactic parameters into the units of a bilingual language model?",
        "What kind of source syntactic parameters are necessary and suf-ficient?",
        "Our contributions can be summarized as fol-lows: We argue that the contextual information used in the original bilingual models (Niehues et al., 2011) is insufficient and introduce a simple model that exploits source-side syntax to improve reordering (Sections 2 and 3).",
        "We perform a thorough comparison between different variants of our general model and compare them to the original approach.",
        "We carry out translation experiments on multiple test sets, two language pairs (Arabic- English and Chinese-English), and with respect to two metrics (BLEU and TER).",
        "Finally, we present a preliminary analysis of the reorderings resulting from the proposed models (Section 4).",
        "2 Motivation In this section, we elaborate on our research questions and provide background for our approach.",
        "We also discuss existing bilingual n-gram models and argue that they are often not expressive enough to differentiate between alternative re-orderings.",
        "We should first note that the most commonly used n-gram model to distinguish between reorderings is a target language model, which does not take translation correspondence into account and just models target-side fluency.",
        "Al-Onaizan and Papineni (2006) show that target language models by themselves are not sufficient to correctly characterize reordering.",
        "In what follows we only discuss bilingual models.",
        "The word-aligned sentence pair in Figure 1.a 2 demonstrates a common Arabic-English reordering.",
        "As stated in the introduction, bilingual language models capture reordering regularities as a sequence of elementary translation events 3 .",
        "In the given example, one could decompose the sequential process of translation as follows: First translate the first word Alwzyr as the minister, then ArjE as attributed, then ArtfAE as the increase and so on.",
        "The sequence of elementary translation events is modeled as an n-gram model (Equation 1, where t i is a translation event).",
        "There are numerous ways in which t i can be defined.",
        "Below we first discuss how they have been defined within previous ap-proaches, and then introduce our definition.",

        "For example, Arabic has a morphological marker of definiteness on both nouns and adjectives.",
        "If we first translate a definite adjective and then an indefinite noun, it will probably not be a likely sequence according to the translation model.",
        "This kind of intuition underlies the model of Niehues et al. (2011), a bilingual LM (BiLM), which defines elementary translation events t 1 , ..., t n as follows: t i = ?e i , {f |f ?",

        "Niehues et al. (2011) refer to the defined translation events t i as bilingual tokens and we adopt this terminology.",
        "There are alternative definitions of bilingual language models.",
        "Our choice of the above definition is supported by the fact that it produces an unambiguous segmentation of a parallel sentence into tokens.",
        "Ambiguous segmentation is undesirable because it increases the token vocabulary, and thus the model sparsity.",
        "Another disadvantage comes from the fact that we want to compare permutations of the same set of elements.",
        "For ex-ample, the two different segmentations of ba into [ba] and [b][a] still represent the same permutation of the sequence ab.",
        "In Figure 1 one can produce a segmentation of (AsEAr Albtrwl, oil prices) into (Albtrwl, oil) and (AsEAr, prices) or leave it as is.",
        "If we allow for both segmentations, the learnt probability parameters may be different for the sum of (Albtrwl, oil) and (AsEAr, prices) and for the unsegmented phrase.",
        "Durrani et al. (2011) introduce an alternative method for unambiguous bilingual segmentation where tokens are defined as minimal phrases, called minimal translation units (MTUs).",
        "Figure 1 compares the BiLM and MTU tokenization for a specific example.",
        "Since Niehues et al. (2011) have shown their model to work successfully as an additional feature in combination with commonly used standard phrase-based features, we use their approach as the main point of reference and base our approach on their segmentation method.",
        "In the rest of the text we refer to Niehues et al. (2011) as the original BiLM.",
        "4 At the same time, we do not see any specific obstacles for combining our work with MTUs.",

        "Indeed, the log-probabilities of the two sequences with respect to a 4-gram BiLM model 5 result in a higher probability of ?10.25 for the incorrect reordering than for the correct one (?10.39).",
        "Since fully lexicalized bilingual tokens suffer from data sparsity and POS-based bilingual tokens are insufficiently expressive, the question is which level of syntactic information strikes the right balance between expressiveness and generality.",

        "The intuitive notion of syntactic modification is captured by the primitive binary relation of dependence.",
        "Dependency relations do not change with the linear order of words (Figure 2) and therefore can provide a characterization of a word's syntactic class that invariant under reordering.",
        "If we incorporate dependency relations into the representation of bilingual tokens, the incorrect reordering in Figure 2.b will produce a highly unlikely sequence.",
        "For example, we can substitute each source word with its POS tag and its par-ent's POS tag (Figure 3).",
        "Again, we computed 4-gram log-probabilities for the corresponding se-quences: the correct reordering results in a substantially higher probability of?10.58 than the incorrect one (?13.48).",

        "We further give details on how the proposed models are trained and integrated into a phrase-based decoder.",
        "1692 3.1 The general framework In the previous section we outlined our framework as composed of two steps: First, a parallel sentence is tokenized according to the BiLM model (Niehues et al., 2011).",
        "Next, words in the bilingual tokens are substituted with their contextual properties.",
        "It is thus convenient to use the following generalized definition for a token sequence t 1 ...t n in our framework: t i = ?ContE (e i ), {ContF (f)|f ?",
        "A(e i )}?, (3) where e i is the i-th target word, A : E ?",
        "P(F ) is an alignment function, F and E are source and target sentences, and ContE and ContF are target and source contextual functions, respectively.",
        "A contextual function returns a word's contextual property, based on its sentential context (source or target).",
        "See Figure 4 for an example of a sequence of BiLM tokens with a ContF defined as returning the POS tag of the source word combined with the POS tags of its parent, grandparent and sib-lings, and ContE defined as an identity function (see Section 3.2 for a detailed explanation of the functions and notation).",
        "In this work we focus on source contextual functions (ContF ).",
        "We also exploit some very simple target contextual functions, but do not go into an in-depth exploration.",
        "3.2 Dependency-based contextual functions In NLP approaches exploiting dependency struc-ture, two kinds of relations are of special impor-tance: the parent-child relation and the sibling relation.",
        "Shen et al. (2008) work with two well-formed dependency structures, both of which are defined in such a way that there is one common parent and a set of siblings.",

        "Their model first decides how a word is reordered with respect to its parent and then how it is reordered with respect to its siblings.",
        "Based on these previous approaches, we propose to characterize contextual syntactic roles of a word in terms of POS tags of the words themselves and their relatives in a dependency tree.",
        "It is straightforward to incorporate parent information since each node has a unique parent.",
        "As for siblings information, we incorporate POS tags of the closest sibling to the left and the closest to the right.",
        "We do not include all of the siblings to avoid overfitting.",
        "In addition to these basic syntactic re-lations, we consider the grandparent relation.",
        "The following list is a summary of the source contextual functions that we use.",
        "We describe a function with respect to the kind of contextual property of a word it returns: (i) the word itself (Lex); (ii) POS label of the word (Pos); (iii) POS label of the word's parent; (iv) POS of the word's closest sibling to the left, concatenated with the POS tag of the closest sibling to the right; (v) the POS label of the word's grandparent.",
        "We use target-side contextual functions returning: (i) an empty string, (ii) POS of the word, (iii) the word itself.",
