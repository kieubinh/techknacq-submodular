        "In the phrase-based SMT framework introduced in (Koehn et al., 2003) and (Marcu and Wong, 2002), the translation model log p(e | f) is factorized into the translation probabilities of matching phrases in the source and target sentences.",
        "2 These probabilities are once again considered additional features in the log-linear model (see Eq. (9)) and are weighted accordingly to maximize the BLEU score.",
        "Since the neural net language model was proposed in (Bengio et al., 2003), neural networks have been used widely in SMT systems.",
        "In many cases, neural networks have been used to rescore translation hypotheses (n-best lists) (see, e.g., (Schwenk et al., 2006)).",
        "Recently, however, there has been interest in training neural networks to score the translated sentence (or phrase pairs) using a representation of the source sentence as an additional input.",
        "See, e.g., (Schwenk, 2012), (Son et al., 2012) and (Zou et al., 2013).",

        "When we train the RNN Encoder?Decoder, we ignore the (normalized) frequencies of each phrase pair in the original corpora.",
        "This measure was taken in order (1) to reduce the computational expense of randomly selecting phrase pairs from a large phrase table according to the normalized frequencies and (2) to ensure that the RNN Encoder?",
        "Decoder does not simply learn to rank the phrase pairs according to their numbers of occurrences.",
        "One underlying reason for this choice was that the existing translation probability in the phrase table already reflects the frequencies of the phrase 2 Without loss of generality, from here on, we refer to p(e | f) for each phrase pair as a translation model as well pairs in the original corpus.",

        "(region of probability concentration) of plausible translations.",
        "Once the RNN Encoder?Decoder is trained, we add a new score for each phrase pair to the existing phrase table.",
        "This allows the new scores to enter into the existing tuning algorithm with minimal additional overhead in computation.",
        "As Schwenk pointed out in (Schwenk, 2012), it is possible to completely replace the existing phrase table with the proposed RNN Encoder?",
        "Decoder.",
        "In that case, for a given source phrase, the RNN Encoder?Decoder will need to generate a list of (good) target phrases.",
        "This requires, how-ever, an expensive sampling procedure to be performed repeatedly.",
        "In this paper, thus, we only consider rescoring the phrase pairs in the phrase table.",
        "3.2 Related Approaches: Neural Networks in Machine Translation Before presenting the empirical results, we discuss a number of recent works that have proposed to use neural networks in the context of SMT.",
        "Schwenk in (Schwenk, 2012) proposed a similar approach of scoring phrase pairs.",
        "Instead of the RNN-based neural network, he used a feedforward neural network that has fixed-size inputs (7 words in his case, with zero-padding for shorter phrases) and fixed-size outputs (7 words in the target lan-guage).",
        "When it is used specifically for scoring phrases for the SMT system, the maximum phrase length is often chosen to be small.",
        "However, as the length of phrases increases or as we apply neural networks to other variable-length sequence data, it is important that the neural network can handle variable-length input and output.",
        "The proposed RNN Encoder?Decoder is well-suited for these applications.",
        "Similar to (Schwenk, 2012), Devlin et al. (Devlin et al., 2014) proposed to use a feedforward neural network to model a translation model, however, by predicting one word in a target phrase at a time.",
        "They reported an impressive improve-ment, but their approach still requires the maximum length of the input phrase (or context words) to be fixed a priori.",
        "1727 Although it is not exactly a neural network they train, the authors of (Zou et al., 2013) proposed to learn a bilingual embedding of words/phrases.",
        "They use the learned embedding to compute the distance between a pair of phrases which is used as an additional score of the phrase pair in an SMT system.",
        "In (Chandar et al., 2014), a feedforward neural network was trained to learn a mapping from a bag-of-words representation of an input phrase to an output phrase.",
        "This is closely related to both the proposed RNN Encoder?Decoder and the model proposed in (Schwenk, 2012), except that their input representation of a phrase is a bag-of-words.",
        "A similar approach of using bag-of-words representations was proposed in (Gao et al., 2013) as well.",
        "Earlier, a similar encoder?decoder model using two recursive neural networks was proposed in (Socher et al., 2011), but their model was restricted to a monolingual setting, i.e. the model reconstructs an input sentence.",
        "More recently, another encoder?decoder model using an RNN was proposed in (Auli et al., 2013), where the decoder is conditioned on a representation of either a source sentence or a source context.",
        "One important difference between the proposed RNN Encoder?Decoder and the approaches in (Zou et al., 2013) and (Chandar et al., 2014) is that the order of the words in source and target phrases is taken into account.",
        "The RNN Encoder?Decoder naturally distinguishes between sequences that have the same words but in a different order, whereas the aforementioned approaches effectively ignore order information.",
        "The closest approach related to the proposed RNN Encoder?Decoder is the Recurrent Continuous Translation Model (Model 2) proposed in (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013).",
        "In their pa-per, they proposed a similar model that consists of an encoder and decoder.",
        "The difference with our model is that they used a convolutional n-gram model (CGM) for the encoder and the hybrid of an inverse CGM and a recurrent neural network for the decoder.",
        "They, however, evaluated their model on rescoring the n-best list proposed by the conventional SMT system and computing the perplexity of the gold standard translations.",
        "4 Experiments We evaluate our approach on the English/French translation task of the WMT?14 workshop.",
        "4.1 Data and Baseline System Large amounts of resources are available to build an English/French SMT system in the framework of the WMT?14 translation task.",
        "The bilingual corpora include Europarl (61M words), news commentary (5.5M), UN (421M), and two crawled corpora of 90M and 780M words respectively.",
        "The last two corpora are quite noisy.",
        "To train the French language model, about 712M words of crawled newspaper material is available in addition to the target side of the bitexts.",
        "All the word counts refer to French words after tokenization.",
        "It is commonly acknowledged that training statistical models on the concatenation of all this data does not necessarily lead to optimal per-formance, and results in extremely large models which are difficult to handle.",
        "Instead, one should focus on the most relevant subset of the data for a given task.",
        "We have done so by applying the data selection method proposed in (Moore and Lewis, 2010), and its extension to bitexts (Axelrod et al., 2011).",
        "By these means we selected a subset of 418M words out of more than 2G words for language modeling and a subset of 348M out of 850M words for training the RNN Encoder?Decoder.",
        "We used the test set newstest2012 and 2013 for data selection and weight tuning with MERT, and newstest2014 as our test set.",
        "Each set has more than 70 thousand words and a single reference translation.",
