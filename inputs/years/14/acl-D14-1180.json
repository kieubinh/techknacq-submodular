        "In previous work, sampling methods have been used to learn Tree Substitution Grammar (TSG) rules from derivation trees (Post and Gildea, 2009; Cohn et al., 2009) for TSG learning.",
        "Here, at each node in the derivation tree, there is a binary variable indicating whether the node is internal to a TSG rule or is a split point, which we refer to as a cut, between two rules.",
        "The problem of extracting machine translation rules from word-aligned bitext is a similar problem in that we wish to automatically learn the best granularity for the rules with which to analyze each sentence.",
        "The problem of rule extraction is more complex, however, because the tree structure of the sentence is also unknown.",
        "In machine translation applications, most previous work on joint alignment and rule extraction models uses heuristic methods to extract rules from learned word alignment or bracketing structures (Zhang et al., 2008; Blunsom et al., 2009; DeNero et al., 2008; Levenberg et al., 2012).",
        "Chung et al. (2014) present a MCMC algorithm schedule to learn Hiero-style SCFG rules (Chiang, 2007) by sampling tree fragments from phrase decomposition forests, which represent all possible rules that are consistent with a set of fixed word alignments.",
        "Assuming fixed word alignments reduces the complexity of the sampling problem, and has generally been effective in most state-of-the-art machine translation systems.",
        "The algorithm for sampling rules from a forest is as follows: from the root of the phrase decomposition forest, one samples a cut variable, denoting whether the current node is a cut, and an edge vari-able, denoting which incoming hyperedge is cho-sen, at each node of the current tree in a top-down manner.",
        "This sampling schedule is efficient in that it only samples the current tree and will not waste time on updating variables that are unlikely to be used in any tree.",
        "As with many other token-based Gibbs Sampling applications, sampling one node at a time can result in slow mixing due to the strong coupling between variables.",
        "One general remedy is to sample blocks of coupled variables.",
        "Cohn and Blunsom (2010) and Yamangil and Shieber (2013) used blocked sampling algorithms that sample the whole tree structure associated with one sentence at a time for TSG and TAG learning.",
        "However, this kind of blocking does not deal with the coupling of variables correlated with the same type of structure across sentences.",
        "Liang et al. (2010) introduced a type-based sampling schedule which updates a block of variables of the same type jointly.",
        "The type of a variable is defined as the combination of new structural choices added when assigning different values to the variable.",
        "Type-based MCMC tackles the coupling issue by assigning the same type to variables that are strongly coupled.",
        "In this paper, we follow the phrase decomposition forest construction procedures of Chung et 1735 al. (2014) and present a type-based MCMC algorithm for sampling tree fragments from phrase decomposition forests which samples the variables of the same type jointly.",
        "We define the type of the cut variable for each node in our sampling schedule.",
        "While type-based MCMC has been proven to be effective in a number of NLP applications, our sample-edge, sample-cut setting is more complicated as our tree structure is unknown.",
        "We need additional steps to maintain the cut type information when the tree structure is changed as we sample the edge variable.",
        "Like other type-based MCMC applications, we need bookkeeping of node sites to be sampled in order to loop through sites of the same type efficiently.",
        "As noted by Liang et al. (2010), indexing by the complete type information is too expensive in some applications like TSG learning.",
        "Our setting is different from TSG learning in that the internal structure of each SCFG rule is abstracted away when deriving the rule type from the tree fragment sampled.",
        "We make the following contributions: 1.",
        "We apply type-based MCMC to the setting of SCFG learning and have achieved better log likelihood and BLEU score result.",
        "2.",
        "We present an innovative way of storing the type information by indexing on partial type information and then filtering the retrieved nodes according to the full type information, which enables efficient updates to maintain the type information while the amount of bookkeeping is reduced significantly.",
        "3.",
        "We replace the two-stage sampling schedule of Liang et al. (2010) with a simpler and faster one-stage method.",
        "4.",
        "We use parallel programming to do inexact type-based MCMC, which leads to a speed up of four times in comparison with non-parallel type-based MCMC, while the likelihood result of the Markov Chain does not change.",
        "This strategy should also work with other type-based MCMC applications.",

For each site (t, n) and the corresponding composed rule types r 1 obtained when we set n's cut value to 0 and r 2 , r 3 obtained when we set the cut value to 1, the cut variable type of site (t, n) is: type(t, n) def = (r 1 , r 2 , r 3 ) We say that the cut variables of two sites are of the same type if the composed rule types r 1 , r 2 and r 3 are exactly the same.",
        "For example, in Figure 3, assume that all the nodes in the hypergraph are currently set to be split points except for the two nodes marked in bold, ([2 6], [1 6]), ([1 4], [4 7]).",

In our exper-iment, this one-stage sampling strategy gives us a 1.5 times overall speed up in comparison with the two-stage sampling schedule of Liang et al. (2010).",
        "4.2 Parallel Implementation As our type-based sampler involves tedious bookkeeping and frequent conflict checking and mismatch of cut types, one iteration of the type-based sampler is slower than an iteration of the token-based sampler when run on a single processor.",

(2009) and Feng and Cohn (2013), who use multiple processors to perform inexact Gibbs Sampling, and find equivalent performance in comparison with an exact Gibbs Sampler with significant speed up.",
        "In our application, we split the data into several subsets and assign each subset to a processor.",
        "Each processor performs type-based sampling on its subset using local counts and local bookkeeping, and communicates the update of the local counts after each iteration.",
