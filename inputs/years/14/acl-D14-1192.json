        "During skilled reading, the eyes of a reader do not move smoothly over a text.",
        "Instead, reading proceeds by alternating between brief fixations on individual words and short ballistic movements called saccades that move the point of fixation to a new location.",
        "Evidence in psychological research indicates that patterns of fixations and saccades are driven partly by low-level visual cues (e.g., word length), and partly by linguistic and cognitive processing of the text (Kliegl et al., 2006; Rayner, 1998).",
        "Eye-movement patterns are frequently studied in cognitive psychology as they provide a rich and detailed record of the visual, oculomotor, and linguistic processes involved in reading.",
        "Computational models of eye-movement control developed in psychology, such as SWIFT (Engbert et al., 2005; Schad and Engbert, 2012) or E-Z Reader (Reichle et al., 1998; Reichle et al., 2012), simulate the generation of eye movements based on physiological and psychological constraints related to attention, visual perception, and the oculomotor system.",
        "Recently, the problem of modeling eye movements has also been approached from a machine-learning perspective.",
        "Matties and S?gaard (2013) and Hara et al. (2012) study conditional random field models to predict which words in a text are fixated by a reader.",
        "Nilsson and Nivre (2009) use a transition-based log-linear model to predict a sequence of fixations for a text.",
        "A central observation made by these studies, as well as by earlier psychological work (Erdmann and Dodge, 1898; Huey, 1908), is that eye movement patterns vary significantly between individuals.",
        "As one example of the strength of individual differences in reading eye movements, we cite Dixon (1951) who compared the reading processes of university professors and graduate students of physics, education, and history on reading material in their own and the two other fields.",
        "He did not find strong effects of his experimental variables (i.e., field of research, expertise in re-search) but ?if there is one thing that this study has shown, it is that individual differences in reading skill existed among the subjects of all departments.",
        "Fast and slow readers were found in every department, and the overlapping of distributions from passage to passage was enormous?",
        "(p. 173).",
        "Even though it is possible to predict across a large base of readers with some accuracy whether specific words will be fixated (Matties and S?gaard, 2013), a strong variation between readers in attributes such as the fraction of skipped words and total number of saccades has been observed (Hara et al., 2012).",
        "Some recent work has studied eye movement patterns as a biometric feature.",
        "Most studies are based on an artificial visual stimulus, such as a moving (Kasprowski and Ober, 2004; Komogortsev et al., 2010; Rigas et al., 2012b; Zhang and Juhola, 2012) or fixed (Bednarik et al., 2005) dot on a computer screen, or a specific image stimulus (Rigas et al., 2012a).",
        "In the most common use 1810 case of biometric user identification, a decision on whether access should be granted has to be made after performing some test that requires the user's attention and therefore cannot take a long time.",
        "By contrast, our work is motivated by a less intrusive scenario in which the user is monitored continuously during access to, for instance, a device or document.",
        "When the accumulated evidence supports the conclusion that the user is not authorized, access can be terminated or additional credentials requested.",
        "In this use case, identification has to be based on saccadic eye movements that occur while a user is reading an arbitrary text?as opposed to movements that occur in response to a fixed, controlled visual stimulus.",
        "Holland and Komogortsev (2012) study reader recognition based on a set of aggregate features derived from eye movements, irrespective of the text being read; their work will serve as reference in our empirical study.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
