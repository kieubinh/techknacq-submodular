        "Hashtags (single tokens often composed of natural language n-grams or abbreviations, prefixed with the character ?#?)",
        "are ubiquitous on social networking services, particularly in short textual documents (a.k.a.",
        "posts).",
        "Authors use hashtags to diverse ends, many of which can be seen as labels for classical NLP tasks: disambiguation (chips #futurism vs. chips #junkfood); identification of named entities (#sf49ers); sentiment (#dislike); and topic annotation (#yoga).",
        "Hashtag prediction is the task of mapping text to its accompanying hashtags.",
        "In this work we propose a novel model for hashtag prediction, and show that this task is also a useful surrogate for learning good representations of text.",
        "Latent representations, or embeddings, are vectorial representations of words or documents, traditionally learned in an unsupervised manner over large corpora.",
        "For example LSA (Deerwester et al., 1990) and its variants, and more recent neural-network inspired methods like those of Bengio et al. (2006), Collobert et al. (2011) and word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) learn word embeddings.",
        "In the word embedding paradigm, each word is represented as a vector in R n , where n is a hyper-parameter that controls capacity.",
        "The embeddings of words comprising a text are combined using a model-dependent, possibly learned function, producing a point in the same embedding space.",
        "A similarity measure (for example, inner product) gauges the pairwise relevance of points in the embedding space.",
        "Unsupervised word embedding methods train with a reconstruction objective in which the embeddings are used to predict the original text.",
        "For example, word2vec tries to predict all the words in the document, given the embeddings of surrounding words.",
        "We argue that hashtag prediction provides a more direct form of supervision: the tags are a labeling by the author of the salient aspects of the text.",
        "Hence, predicting them may provide stronger semantic guidance than unsupervised learning alone.",
        "The abundance of hashtags in real posts provides a huge labeled dataset for learning potentially sophisticated models.",
        "In this work we develop a convolutional network for large scale ranking tasks, and apply it to hashtag prediction.",
        "Our model represents both words and the entire textual post as embeddings as intermediate steps.",
        "We show that our method outperforms existing unsupervised (word2vec) and supervised (WSABIE (Weston et al., 2011)) embedding methods, and other baselines, at the hashtag prediction task.",
        "We then probe our model's generality, by trans-fering its learned representations to the task of personalized document recommendation: for each of M users, given N previous positive interactions with documents (likes, clicks, etc.",
        "), predict the N + 1?th document the user will positively interact with.",
        "To perform well on this task, the representation should capture the user's interest in textual content.",

        "tional architecture performs better than WSABIE trained on the same hashtag task.",
        "2 Prior Work Some previous work (Davidov et al., 2010; Godin et al., 2013; She and Chen, 2014) has addressed hashtag prediction.",
        "Most such work applies to much smaller sets of hashtags than the 100,000 we consider, with the notable exception of Ding et al. (2012), which uses an unsupervised method.",
        "As mentioned in Section 1, many approaches learn unsupervised word embeddings.",
        "In our experiments we use word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) as a representative scalable model for unsupervised embeddings.",
        "WSABIE (Weston et al., 2011) is a supervised embedding approach that has shown promise in NLP tasks (Weston et al., 2013; Hermann et al., 2014).",
        "WSABIE is shallow, linear, and ignores word order information, and so may have less modeling power than our approach.",
        "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in which shared weights are applied across the in-put, are popular in the vision domain and have recently been applied to semantic role labeling (Col- lobert et al., 2011) and parsing (Collobert, 2011).",
        "Neural networks in general have also been applied to part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition (Collobert et al., 2011; Turian et al., 2010), and sentiment detection (Socher et al., 2013).",
        "All these tasks involve predicting a limited (2-30) number of labels.",
        "In this work, we make use of CNNs, but apply them to the task of ranking a very large set of tags.",
        "We thus propose a model and training scheme that can scale to this class of problem.",
        "3 Convolutional Embedding Model Our model #TAGSPACE (see Figure 1), like other word embedding models, starts by assigning a d-dimensional vector to each of the l words of an input document w 1 , .",

        ", w l , resulting in a matrix of size l ?",
        "d. This is achieved using a matrix of N ?",
        "d parameters, termed the lookup-table layer (Collobert et al., 2011), where N is the vocabulary size.",
        "In this work N is 10 6 , and each row of the matrix represents one of the million most frequent words in the training corpus.",
        "A convolution layer is then applied to the l ?",
        "d input matrix, which considers all successive windows of text of size K, sliding over the document from position 1 to l. This requires a further Kd?H weights and H biases to be learned.",
        "To account for words at the two boundaries of the document we also apply a special padding vector at both ends.",
        "In our experiments K was set to 5 and H was set to 1000.",
        "After the convolutional step, a tanh nonlinearity followed by a max operation over the l ?",
        "H features extracts a fixed-size (H-dimensional) global feature vector, which is independent of document size.",
        "Finally, another tanh non-linearity followed by a fully connected linear layer of size H?d is applied to represent the entire document in the original embedding space of d-dimensions.",
        "Hashtags are also represented using d-dimensional embeddings using a lookup-table.",
        "We represent the top 100,000 most frequent tags.",
        "For a given document w we then rank any given hashtag t using the scoring function: f(w, t) = e conv (w) ?",
        "e lt (t) 1823 where e conv (w) is the embedding of the document by the CNN just described and e lt (t) is the embedding of a candidate tag t. We can thus rank all candidate hashtags via their scores f(w, t), largest first.",
        "To train the above scoring function, and hence the parameters of the model we minimize a ranking loss similar to the one used in WSABIE as a training objective: for each training example, we sample a positive tag, compute f(w, t + ), then sample random tags ?",
        "t up to 1000 times until f(w, ?",
        "t) > m + f(w, t + ), where m is the margin.",
        "A gradient step is then made to optimize the pairwise hinge loss: L = max{0,m?",
        "f(w, t + ) + f(w, ?",
        "t)}.",
        "We use m = 0.1 in our experiments.",
        "This loss function is referred to as the WARP loss in (We- ston et al., 2011) and is used to approximately optimizing the top of the ranked list, useful for metrics like precision and recall@k. In particu-lar, the search for a negative candidate tag means that more energy is spent on improving the ranking performance of positive labels already near the top of the ranked list, compared to only randomly sampling of negatives, which would optimize the average rank instead.",
        "Minimizing our loss is achieved with parallel stochastic gradient descent using the hogwild algorithm (Niu et al., 2011).",
        "The lookup-table layers are initialized with the embeddings learned by WSABIE to expedite convergence.",
        "This kind of ?pre-training?",
        "is a standard trick in the neural network literature, see e.g. (Socher et al., 2011).",
        "The ranking loss makes our model scalable to 100,000 (or more) hashtags.",
        "At each training example only a subset of tags have to be computed, so it is far more efficient than a standard classification loss that considers them all.",
        "4 Experiments 4.1 Data Our experiments use two large corpora of posts containing hashtags from a popular social network.",
        "1 The first corpus, which we call people, consists of 201 million posts from individual user accounts, comprising 5.5 billion words.",

        "Both are summarized in Table 1.",
        "Both corpora comprise posts between February 1st and February 17th, 2014.",
        "Since we are not attempting a multi-language model, we use a simple trigram-based language prediction model to consider only posts whose most likely language is English.",
        "The two datasets use hashtags very differently.",
        "The pages dataset has a fatter head, with popular tags covering more examples.",
        "The people dataset uses obscure tags more heavily.",
        "For example, the top 100 tags account for 33.9% of page tags, but only 13.1% of people tags.",
        "4.2 Hashtag prediction The hashtag prediction task attempts to rank a post's ground-truth hashtags higher than hashtags it does not contain.",
        "We trained models on both the people and page datasets, and collected precision at 1, recall at 10, and mean rank for 50,000 randomly selected posts withheld from training.",
        "A further 50,000 withheld posts are used for selecting hyperparameters.",
