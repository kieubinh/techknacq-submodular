        "Discourse structures of documents are believed to be highly beneficial for generating informative and coherent summaries.",
        "Several discourse-based summarization methods have been devel-oped, such as (Marcu, 1998; Daum?e III and Marcu, 2002; Hirao et al., 2013; Kikuchi et al., 2014).",
        "Moreover, the current best ROUGE score for the summarization benchmark data of the RST-discourse Treebank (Carlson et al., 2002) has been provided by (Hirao et al., 2013), whose method also utilizes discourse trees.",
        "Thus, the discourse-based summarization approach is one promising way to obtain high-quality summaries.",
        "One possible weakness of discourse-based summarization techniques is that they rely greatly on the accuracy of the discourse parser they use.",
        "For example, the above discourse-based summarization methods utilize discourse trees based on the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988) for their discourse information.",
        "Unfortunately, the current state-of-the-art RST parser, as described in (Hernault et al., 2010), is insufficient as an off-the-shelf discourse parser.",
        "In fact, there is empirical evidence that the quality (i.e., ROUGE score) of summaries from auto-parsed discourse trees is significantly degraded compared with those generated from gold discourse trees (Marcu, 1998; Hirao et al., 2013).",
        "From this background, the goal of this paper is to develop an appropriate discourse parser for discourse-based summarization.",
        "We first focus on one of the best discourse-based single document summarization methods as proposed in (Hirao et al., 2013).",
        "Their method formulates a single document summarization problem as a Tree Knapsack Problem (TKP) over a dependency-based discourse tree (DEP-DT).",
        "In their method, DEP-DTs are automatically transformed from (auto-parsed) RST-discourse trees (RST-DTs) by heuristic rules.",
        "Instead, we develop a DEP-DT parser, that directly provides DEP-DTs for their state-of-the-art discourse-based summarization method.",
        "We show that summaries generated by our parser improve the ROUGE scores to almost the same level as those generated by gold DEP-DTs.",
        "We also investigate the way in which the parsing accuracy helps to improve the ROUGE scores.",
        "2 Single-Document Summarization as a Tree Knapsack Problem Hirao et al. (2013) formulated single-document summarization as a TKP that is run on the DEP-DT.",

        "Since a nucleus is more important than a satellite in terms of the writer's purpose, a satellite is always a child of a nucleus in the RST-DT.",
        "Some discourse relations between a nucleus and a satellite or two nuclei are defined.",
        "Since the TKP of (Hirao et al., 2013) employs a DEP-DT obtained from an automatically parsed RST-DT, their method strongly relies on the accuracy of the RST parser.",
        "For example, in Figure 1(a), if the RST-DT parser incorrectly sets the node n 2 as Satellite and the node n 3 as Nu-cleus, we obtain an incorrect DEP-DT in Figure 1(b) because the transformation algorithm uses the Nucleus-Satellite relationships in the RST-DT.",
        "The dependency relationships in Figure 1(b) are quite different from that of the correct DEP-DT in Figure 1(c).",
        "In this example, the parser failed to determine the most salient EDU e 2 , that is the root EDU of the gold DEP-DT.",
        "Thus, the summary extracted from this DEP-DT will have a low ROUGE score.",
        "The results motivated us to design a new discourse parser fully trained on the DEP-DTs and 1 Li et al. also defined a similar transformation algorithm (Li et al., 2014).",
