        "Extraction of entities and relations from texts has been traditionally treated as a pipeline of two separate subtasks: entity recognition and relation extraction.",
        "This separation makes the task easy to deal with, but it ignores underlying dependencies between and within subtasks.",
        "First, since entity recognition is not affected by relation extraction, errors in entity recognition are propagated to relation extraction.",
        "Second, relation extraction is often treated as a multi-class classification problem on pairs of entities, so dependencies between pairs are ignored.",
        "Examples of these dependencies are illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "For dependencies between subtasks, a Live in relation requires PER and LOC entities, and vice versa.",
        "For in-subtask dependencies, the Live in relation between ?Mrs.",
        "Tsutayama?",
        "and ?Japan?",
        "can be inferred from the two other relations.",
        "Figure 1 also shows that the task has a flexible graph structure.",

        "Joint learning approaches (Yang and Cardie, 2013; Singh et al., 2013) incorporate these dependencies and local constraints in their models; however most approaches are time-consuming and employ complex structures consisting of multiple models.",
        "Li and Ji (2014) recently proposed a history-based structured learning approach that is simpler and more computationally efficient than other approaches.",
        "While this approach is promis-ing, it still has a complexity in search and restricts the search order partly due to its semi-Markov rep-resentation, and thus the potential of the history-based learning is not fully investigated.",
        "In this paper, we introduce an entity and relation table to address the difficulty in representing the task.",
        "We propose a joint extraction of entities and relations using a history-based structured learning on the table.",
        "This table representation simplifies the task into a table-filling problem, and makes the task flexible enough to incorporate several enhancements that have not been addressed in the previous history-based approach, such as search orders in decoding, global features from relations to entities, and several learning methods with inexact search.",
        "2 Method In this section, we first introduce an entity and relation table that is utilized to represent the whole 1858 entity and relation structures in a sentence.",
        "We then overview our model on the table.",

        "Relations are defined on not entities but words, since entities are not always given when relations are extracted.",
        "Relations on entities are mapped to relations on the last words of the entities.",
        "Based on this representation, we propose an entity and relation table that jointly represents entities and relations in a sentence.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates an entity and relation table corresponding to an example in Figure 1.",
        "We use only the lower triangular part because the table is symmetric, so the number of cells is n(n + 1)/2 when there are n words in a sentence.",
        "With this entity and relation table representation, the joint extraction problem can be mapped to a table-filling problem in that labels are assigned to cells in the table.",
        "2.2 Model We tackle the table-filling problem by a history-based structured learning approach that assigns labels to cells one by one.",
        "This is mostly the same as the traditional history-based model (Collins, 2002) except for the table representation.",

        "The features will be explained in ?2.5.",
        "The weights w can also be divided, but they are tuned jointly in learning as shown in ?2.4.",
        "2.3 Decoding The scoring function s(x,y, 1, i) in Equation (2) uses all the preceding assignments and does not rely on the Markov assumption, so we cannot employ dynamic programming.",
        "We instead employ a beam search to find the best assignment with the highest score (Collins and Roark, 2004).",
        "The beam search assigns labels to cells one by one with keeping the top K best assignments when moving from a cell to the next cell, and it returns the best assignment when labels are assigned to all the cells.",

        "We employed feature hashing (Weinberger et al., 2009) and limited the feature space to 2 24 .",
        "The numbers of features greatly varied for categories and targets.",
        "They also caused biased predictions that prefer entities to relations in our preliminary experiments.",
        "We thus chose to re-scale the features as follows.",
        "We normalized local features for each feature category and then for each target.",
        "We also normalized global features for each feature cate-gory, but we did not normalize them for each target since normalization was impossible during decoding.",
        "We instead scaled the global features, and the scaling factor was tuned by using the same 5-fold cross validation above.",
        "We used the F1 score on relations with entities as our primary evaluation measure and used it for tuning parameters.",
        "In this measure, a relation with two entities is considered correct when the offsets and types of the entities and the type of the relation are all correct.",
        "We also evaluated the F1 scores for entities and relations individually on the test data set by checking their corresponding cells.",
        "An entity is correct when the offset and type are correct, and a relation is correct when the type is correct and the last words of two entities are correct.",
        "3.2 Performance on Training Data Set It is infeasible to investigate all the combinations of the parameters, so we greedily searched for a default parameter setting by using the evaluated results on the training data set.",
        "The default parameter setting was the best setting except for the beam size.",
        "We show learning curves on the training data set in Figure 6 when we varied each parameter from the default parameter setting.",
        "We employed 5-fold cross validation.",
        "The default parameter setting used DCD-SSVM as the learning method, entity-first, easy-first as the search order, local and global features, and 8 as the beam size.",
        "This section discusses how these parameters affect the performance on the training data set and explains how the parameter setting was selected for the test set.",
        "Figure 6(a) compares the learning methods introduced in ?2.4.",
        "DCD-SSVM and AdaGrad performed slightly better than perceptron, which has often been employed in history-based structured learning.",
        "AROW did not show comparable performance to the others.",
        "We ran 100 iterations to find the number of iterations that saturates learning curves.",
        "The large number of iterations took time and the performance of DCD-SSVM almost converged after 30 iterations, so we employed 50 iterations for other evaluation on the training data set.",
        "AdaGrad got its highest performance more quickly than other learning methods and AROW converged slower than other methods, so we employed 10 for AdaGrad, 90 for AROW, and 50 iterations for other settings on the test data set.",
        "The performance was improved by widening the beam as in Figure 6(b), but the improvement was gradually diminished as the beam size increased.",
        "Since the wider beam requires more training and test time, we chose 8 for the beam size.",
        "Figure 6(c) shows the effects of joint learning as well as features explained in ?2.5.",
        "We show the performance of the pipeline approach (Pipeline) introduced in ?3.1, and the performance with local features alone (Local), local and global features without global ?Relation?",
        "features in Table 5 (Local+global (?relation)) and all local and global features (Local+global).",
        "We note that Pipeline shows the learning curve of relation extraction in the pipeline approach.",
        "Features in ?Local+global (?relation)?",
        "are the same as the features in the pipeline approach, and the result shows that the joint learning approach performed slightly better than the pipeline approach.",
        "The incorporation of global ?Entity?",
        "and ?Entity+Relation?",
        "features improved the performance as is common with the existing pipeline approaches, and relation-related features further improved the performance.",
        "Static search orders in ?2.3.1 also affected the performance as shown in Figure 6(d), although search orders are not investigated in the joint entity and relation extraction.",
        "Surprisingly, the gap 1864 (a) Learning methods (b) Beam sizes (c) Features and pipeline / joint approaches (d) Static search orders (e) Dynamic search orders Figure 6: Learning curves of entity and relation extraction on the training data set using 5-fold cross validation.",
        "between the performances with the best order and worst order was about 0.04 in an F1 score, which is statistically significant, and the performance can be worse than the pipeline approach in Figure 6(c).",
        "This means improvement by joint learning can be easily cancelled out if we do not carefully consider search order.",
        "It is also surprising that the second worst order (Figure 4(b)) is the most intuitive ?left-to-right?",
        "order, which is closest to the order in Li and Ji (2014) among the six search orders.",
        "Figure 6(e) shows the performance with dynamic search orders.",
        "Unfortunately, the easy-first policy did not work well on this entity and relation task, but, with the two enhancements, dynamic orders performed as well as the best static order in Figure 6(d).",
        "This shows that entities should be de-1865 tected earlier than relations on this data set.",
        "3.3 Performance on Test Data Set Table 6 summarizes the performance on the test data set.",
        "We employed the default parameter setting explained in ?3.2, and compared parameters by changing the parameters shown in the first column.",
        "We performed a statistical test using the approximate randomization method (Noreen, 1989) on our primary measure (?Entity+Relation?).",
        "The results are almost consistent with the results on the training data set with a few exceptions.",
        "Differently from the results on the training data set, AdaGrad and AROW performed significantly worse than perceptron and DCD-SSVM and they performed slightly worse than the pipeline approach.",
        "This result shows that DCD-SSVM performs well with inexact search and the selection of learning methods can significantly affect the entity and relation extraction performance.",
        "The joint learning approach showed a significant improvement over the pipeline approach with relation-related global features, although the joint learning approach alone did not show a significant improvement over the pipeline approach.",
        "Unfortunately, no joint learning approach outperformed the pipeline approach in entity recognition.",
        "This may be partly because hyper-parameters were tuned to the primary measure.",
        "The results on the pipeline approach also indicate that the better performance on entity recognition does not necessarily improve the relation extraction performance.",
        "Search orders also affected the performance, and the worst order (right to left, down to up) and best order (close-first, left to right) were significantly different.",
        "The performance of the worst order was worse than that of the pipeline approach, although the difference was not significant.",
        "These results show that it is necessary to carefully select the search order for the joint entity and relation extraction task.",
        "3.4 Comparison with Other Systems To compare our model with the other systems (Roth and Yih, 2007; Kate and Mooney, 2010), we evaluated the performance of our model when the entity boundaries were given.",
        "Differently from our setting in ?3.1, we used the gold entity boundaries encoded in the BILOU scheme and assigned entity labels to the boundaries.",
        "We performed 5-fold cross validation on the data set following Roth and Yih (2007) although the split was different from theirs since their splits were not available.",
        "We employed the default parameter setting in ?3.2 for this comparison.",
        "Table 7 shows the evaluation results.",
        "Although we cannot directly compare the results, our model performs better than the other models.",
        "Compared to Table 6, Table 7 also shows that the inclusion of entity boundary detection degrades the performance about 0.09 in F-score.",
        "4 Related Work Search order in structured learning has been studied in several NLP tasks.",
        "Left-to-right and right-to-left orderings have been often investigated in sequential labeling tasks (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001).",
        "Easy-first policy was firstly introduced by Goldberg and Elhadad (2010) for dependency parsing, and it was successfully employed in several tasks, such as joint POS tagging and dependency parsing (Ma et al., 2012) and co-reference resolution (Stoyanov and Eisner, 2012).",
        "Search order, however, has not been focused in relation extraction tasks.",
        "Named entity recognition (Florian et al., 2003; Nadeau and Sekine, 2007) and relation extraction (Zelenko et al., 2003; Miwa et al., 2009) have often been treated as separate tasks, but there are some previous studies that treat entities and relations jointly in learning.",
        "Most studies built joint learning models upon individual models for subtasks, such as Integer Linear Programming (ILP) (Roth and Yih, 2007; Yang and Cardie, 2013) and Card-Pyramid Parsing (Kate and Mooney, 2010).",
        "Our approach does not require such individual models, and it also can detect entity boundaries that these approaches except for Yang and Cardie (2013) did not treat.",
        "Other studies (Yu and Lam, 2010; Singh et al., 2013) built global probabilistic graphical models.",
        "They need to compute distributions over variables, but our approach does not.",
        "Li and Ji (2014) proposed an approach to jointly find entities and relations.",
        "They incorporated a semi-Markov chain in representing entities and they defined two actions during search, but our approach does not employ such representation and actions, and thus it is more simple and flexible to investigate search orders.",
