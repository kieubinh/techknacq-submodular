        "As a language with no grammatical tense, Chinese does not encode the temporal location of an event directly in a verb, while in English, the grammatical tense of a verb is a strong indicator of the temporal location of an event.",
        "In this paper we address the problem of inferring the semantic tense, or the temporal location of an event (e.g., present, past, future) in Chinese text.",
        "The semantic tense is defined relative to the utterance time or document creation time, and it does not always agree with the grammatical tense in languages like English where there is grammatical tense.",
        "Inferring semantic tense potentially benefits natural language processing tasks such as Machine Translation and Information Extraction (Xue, 2008; Reichart and Rappoport, 2010; Ye et al., 2006; Ye, 2007; Liu et al., 2011), but previous work has shown that automatic inference of the semantic tense of events in Chinese is a very challenging task (Xue, 2008; Ye et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2011).",
        "There are at least two reasons why this is a difficult problem.",
        "First, since Chinese does not have grammatical tense which could serve as an important clue when annotating the semantic tense of an event, generating consistent annotation for Chinese semantic tense has proved to be a challenge.",
        "Xue and Zhang (2014) use a ?distant annotation?",
        "method to address this problem.",
        "They take advantage of an English-Chinese parallel corpus with manual word alignments (Li et al., 2012) , and perform annotation on the English side, which provides more explicit information such as grammatical tense that helps annotators decide the appropriate semantic tense.",
        "The annotations are then projected to the Chinese side via the word alignments.",
        "They show consistent annotation agreements on semantic tense.",
        "Second, the lack of grammatical tense also makes automatic inference of Chinese semantic tense challenging since the grammatical tense would be an important source of information for predicting the semantic tense.",
        "Previous work has shown that it is very difficult to achieve high accuracy using standard machine learning techniques such as Maximum Entropy and Conditional Random Field classifiers combined with extensive feature engineering.",
        "We address these challenges in two ways.",
        "First of all, we take advantage of the newly annotated corpus described in (Xue and Zhang, 2014) in which semantic tense is annotated together with eventuality type and modality using the distant annotation method.",
        "This makes it possible to use these two additional sources of information to help predict tense.",
        "Eventuality type and modality are intricately tied to tense.",
        "For example, Smith and 1902 Erbaugh (2005) show that states by default hold in the present but (episodic) events occur by default in the past.",
        "This means knowing the eventuality type of an event would help determine the tense.",
        "Eventuality type and modality are also annotated on the English side and then projected onto the Chinese side via manual word alignments, taking advantage of the rich morphosyntactic clues in English.",
        "High inter-annotator agreement scores are also reported on eventuality type and modality.",
        "We experimented with two ways of using eventuality type and modality information.",
        "In the first approach, we first train statistical machine learning models to predict eventuality type and modality and then use these two sources of information as features to predict semantic tense.",
        "In the second approach we trained joint learning models between semantic tense and eventuality type, and between semantic tense and modality.",
        "We show both approaches improve the tense inference accuracy over a baseline where these two sources of information are not used.",
        "Second, in our statistical machine learning experiments on tense inference using feature engineering, we find that the design of feature templates has great influence on the results.",
        "So in order to explore more possible feature combinations and mitigate the feature engineering work, we apply artificial neural network models to this problem.",
        "This shows improvements on tense inference accuracy as well in some of the experiment settings.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 discusses related work in automatic tense inference.",
        "Section 3 briefly introduces the distant annotation method.",
        "In section 4, we describe our experiments and analyze the experimental results.",
        "We conclude this paper in section 7.",
        "2 Related Work Inferring the semantic tense of events in Chinese text is not a new topic.",
        "There have been several attempts at it, yet high accuracy in this task has proved to be elusive.",
        "Using a corpus with tense annotated directly in Chinese text, Xue (2008) performed extensive feature engineering in a machine learning framework to address this problem.",
        "They used both local lexical features and structured features extracted from manually annotated syntactic parsing trees.",
        "In our baseline method, we adopt most of their features as the baseline, only on a new corpus in which semantic tenses are not annotated directly on Chinese events but projected from annotations from the English side of a parallel Chinese-English corpus.",
        "In our experiments, we also use structural features extracted from automatic parse trees, so our experimental settings are more realistic.",
        "Ye et al. (2006) took a similar approach in which they predict tense with feature engineering in a statistical learning framework.",
        "They also used a Chinese-English parallel corpus and projected tense for English events onto Chinese events via human alignments.",
        "The main difference between their data and ours is that they used the grammatical tense of the English events, while we use human-annotated semantic tense which we believe are more ?transferrable?",
        "across languages as it is free of the language-specific idiosyncrasies of grammatical tense.",
        "In addition, they also used human annotated linguistic information as ?latent?",
        "features in their work, which are similar to our implicit linguistic features.",
        "However, the ?latent?",
        "features that they used in their system are human-annotated, while the eventuality type and modality features in our system are predicted automatically.",
        "Another difference is that they ignored events that are not verbs.",
        "For example, they excluded verbal expressions in Chinese that are translated into nominal phrases in English.",
        "In contrast, we kept all events in our data, and they can be realized as verbs, nouns, as well as words in other parts of speech.",
        "We performed separate experiments on events realized as verbal expressions and events not in verbal expressions to investigate their impact on semantic tense inference.",
        "Liu et al. (2011) introduced more global features in a machine learning framework, and on top of that proposed an iterative learning algorithm which better handles noisy data, but they also ignored events that are not realized as verbal ex-pressions, or events that are verbal expressions but have more than one verb in them.",
        "They mainly focused on events that are one-verb expressions.",
        "In a similar work on inferring tense in English text, Reichart and Rappoport (2010) aimed at inferring fine-grained semantic tenses for events in English.",
        "They introduced a fine-grained sense taxonomy for tense in a more general Tense Sense Disambiguation (TSD) task to annotate and disambiguate semantic tenses.",
        "The underlying senses include ?things that are always true?, ?general and repeated actions and habits?, ?plans, expectations 1903 and hopes?, etc., which encode a combination of tense, eventuality type and modality.",
        "In the corpus that we use, the same information is organized in a more structured manner along three dimensions ?",
        "semantic tense, eventuality type, and modality.",
        "3 Distant Annotation Figure 1 shows the distant annotation procedure from (Xue and Zhang, 2014).",
        "Starting with a word-aligned parallel English-Chinese corpus, all sentences are part-of-speech (POS) tagged first and then all verb instances in the English text as well as expressions aligned with verb instances on the Chinese side are targeted for annotation.",
        "As we will show in Section 4, these expressions include verbs as well as nouns, prepositions and word sequences ?headed?",
        "by a verb.",
        "We consider those expressions as events.",
        "Annotators work only on the English side and tag every event with a pre-defined semantic tense label.",
        "These labels are then projected from the English side to the Chinese side via word alignments.",
        "The resulting corpus contains events annotated with semantic tense labels in both languages.",
        "Categories for semantic tense are ?Past?, ?Present?, ?Future?, ?Relative Past?, ?Relative Present?, ?Relative Future?, and ?None?.",
        "Events annotated with relative tenses are also linked to another event that serves as the temporal reference for the event in question.",
        "In some cases the relative tense can be resolved to an absolute tense.",
        "For example, if an event is annotated with a ?relative past?",
        "tense to a reference event that is annotated with a present tense, then the semantic tense of that event can resolve to an absolute ?past?",
        "tense.",
        "In other cases, they can not be resolved.",
        "For example, if an event is labeled with a ?relative future?",
        "tense and the reference event has a past tense, then its tense cannot be resolved to an absolute tense, which is defined with regard to the utterance time or document creation time.",
        "In our work, where possible, we resolve these links and keep only absolute tense labels.",
        "For events with relative tenses that can not be resolved (i.e. events which are ?Relative Fu-ture?",
        "to ?Past?",
        "events, or events which are ?Rela- tive Past?",
        "to ?Future?",
        "events), we use ?None?",
        "as the default label.",
        "Eventuality type and modality are labeled in the same way as auxiliary annotation that can help with the inference of tense.",
        "Labels for eventuality type include ?Episodic?, ?Habitual?, ?State?, ?Progressive?, ?Completed?, and ?None?.",
        "Labels for modality are ?Actual?, ?Intended?, ?Hypothet- ical?, ?Modalized?, and ?None?.",
        "Readers are ref-ered to (Xue and Zhang, 2014) for detailed explanations of each label.",
        "Figure 1: Distant annotation procedure.",
        "As we mentioned in Section 2, in this corpus not only verbs but also their counterparts on the opposite language are considered as events, yielding events that may not be verbs.",
        "For example, in the following sentence pair (1), the Chinese verb (VV) ????",
        "is aligned with an English noun (NN) ?use?.",
        "In the sentence pair (2), the English verb (VBG) ?opening?",

        "Human annotation of tense is performed on the newswire and webblog sections of this corpus.",
        "They report that the average pairwise agreement among three annotators consistently stays above 80% and the average Kappa score consistently exceeds 70%, indicating reliable annotation.",
        "Apart from using the entire corpus, we also conducted experiments on three different subsets of the corpus.",
        "An examination of the data indicates that newswire data is grammatically more formal and complete than webblog data, so we also conducted separate experiments on newswire data only.",
        "Considering that the diversity of the parts of speech of the events may affect the inference accuracy and that most of our features extracted from the parse trees assume that our events being verbs, we also conducted experiments exclusively on ?v events?.",

        "consist of two parts.",
        "One part is events that are realized as a single word and the word is a verb; the other one is events which have multiple words but there is only one verb among them.",
        "In the latter case, we stripped off words tagged with other parts of speech and only keep the verbs as events.",

        "Statistics show that in webblog data about 13.4% of the events are tagged as ?None?, while in newswire data only around 6.7% are ?None?.",
        "Another piece of evidence showing webblog data is harder to process is the different inter-annotator agreement scores for tense annotation on newswire and webblog data reported by (Xue and Zhang, 2014).",
