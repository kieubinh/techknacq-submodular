        "Since the Message Understanding Conferences in the 1990s (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996; Chin-chor and Robinson, 1997), Information Extraction (IE) and Named Entity Recognition (NER) approaches have been applied and evaluated on a variety of domains and textual genres.",
        "The majority of the work, however, focuses on the journalistic, scientific, and informal genres (newswires, scientific publications, blogs, tweets, and other social media texts) (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007) and deals with purely textual corpora.",
        "As a result, the feature space of NER systems involves purely textual features, typically word attributes and characteristics (orthography, morphology, dictionary lookup, etc.",
        "), their contexts and document features (surrounding word window, local syntax, docu-ment/corpus word frequencies, etc.)",
        "(Nadeau and Sekine, 2007).",
        "At the same time, textual information is often presented in visually rich formats, e.g. HTML and PDF.",
        "In addition to text, these formats use a variety of visually salient characteristics, (e.g. color, font size, positioning) to either highlight or augment textual information.",
        "In some genres and do-mains, a textual representation of the data, excluding visual features is often not enough to accurately identify named entities of interest or extract relevant information.",
        "Marketing materials, such as online flyers or HTML emails, often contain a plethora of visual features and text-based NER approaches lead to poor results.",
        "In this paper, we present a supervised approach that uses a combination of textual and visual features to recognize named entities in online marketing materials.",
        "2 Motivation and Problem Definition A number of broker-based industries (e.g. commercial real estate, heavy equipment machinery, etc.)",
        "lack a centralized searchable database with industry offerings.",
        "In particular, the commercial real estate industry (unlike residential real estate) does not have a centralized database or an established source of information.",
        "Commercial real estate brokers often need to rely on networking, chance, and waste time with a variety of commercial real estate databases that often present outdated information.",
        "While brokers do not often update third party inventory databases, they do create marketing materials (usually PDF flyers) that contain all relevant listing information.",
        "Virtually all commercial real estate offerings come with publicly available marketing material that contains all relevant listing information.",
        "Our goal is to harness this source of information (the marketing flyer) and use it to extract structured listing information.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of a commercial real estate flyer.",
        "The commercial real estate flyers are often distributed as PDF documents, links to HTML pages, or visually rich HTML-based 1924 Figure 1: An example of a commercial real estate flyer c ?",

        "They typically contain all relevant listing information such as the address and neighborhood of the offering, the names and contact information of the brokers, the type of space offered (build- ing, land, unit(s) within a building), etc.",
        "Similar to other info-graphics, relevant information could be easily pinpointed by visual clues.",
        "For example, the listing street address in Figure 1 (1629 N. Halsted St., upper left corner) can be quickly identified and distinguished from the brokerage firm street address (156 N. Jefferson St., upper right corner) due to its visual prominence (font color, size, position-ing).",
        "In this study we explored a supervised machine learning approach to the task of identifying listing information from commercial real estate flyers.",
        "In particular, we focused on the recognition of 12 types of named entities as described in Table 1 below.",
        "3 Related Work Nadeau and Satoshi (2007) present a survey of NER and describe the feature space of NER research.",
        "While they mention multi-media NER in the context of video/text processing, all described features/approaches focus only on textual representation.",

        "The literature on Information Extraction from HTML resources is dominated by various approaches based on wrapper induction (Kushmer- ick, 1997; Kushmerick, 2000).",
        "Wrapper inductions rely on common HTML structure (based on the HTML DOM) and formatting features to extract structured information from similarly formatted HTML pages.",
        "This approach, however, is not applicable to the genres of marketing materials (PDF and HTML) since they typically do not share any common structure that can be used to identify relevant named entities.",

        "In (Zhu et al., 2007) authors use layout information based on font size and weight for NER for automated expense reimbursement.",
        "While the idea of utilizing visual features based on HTML style has been previously suggested, this study tackles a non-trivial visually rich dataset that prevents the use of previously suggested simplistic approaches to computing HTML features (such as relying on the HTML DOM tree or simplistic HTML style rendering).",
        "In addition, we introduce the use of RGB color as a feature and normalize it approximating human perception.",
        "4 Dataset and Method The dataset consists of 800 randomly selected commercial real estate flyers spanning 315 US locations, 75 companies, and 730 brokers.",
        "The flyers were collected from various online sources and were originally generated using a variety of HTML and PDF creator tools.",
        "The collection represents numerous flyer formats and layouts, commercial real estate property types (industrial, re-tail, office, land, etc.",
        "), and transactions (invest- ment, sale, lease).",

        "Annotation guidelines were developed and the 2 annotators were able to achieve an inter-annotator agreement of 91% 2 .",
        "The named entities with lowest inter-annotator agreement were entities describing Space Size and Type because of the somewhat complex rules for determining essential listing space information.",
        "For example, one of the space size/type rules reads as follows: If the listing refers to a building and mentions the lot size, include both the land size, the building size, and corresponding space types.",
        "Do not include individual parts of the building (e.g. office/basement) as separate spaces.",
        "If the listing refers to a UNIT within the building, not the whole building, then DO NOT include the land site as a separate space.",

        "then applied to the task of identifying the 12 named entities shown in Table 1.",
        "Flyers were converted to text using an HTML parser while preserving some of the white space formatting.",
        "The text was tokenized and the task was then modeled as a BIO classification task, classifiers identify the Beginning, the Inside, and Outside of the text segments.",

        "Token Kind Possible values are word, number, symbol, punctuation.",
        "Regex type Regex-based rules were used to mark chunks as one of 3 regex types: email, phone number, zip code.",

        "Table 2: List of text-based features used for the NER task.",
        "A sliding window of the 5 preceding and 5 following tokens was used for all features.",
        "1926 As noted previously, human annotators were able to quickly spot named entities of interest solely because of their visual characteristics.",
        "For example, a text-only version of the flyer shown in Figure 1, stripped of all rich formatting, will make it quite difficult to distinguish the listing address (shown in prominent size, position, and color) from the brokerage company address, which is rarely prominent as it is not considered important information in the context of the flyer.",
        "Similarly, the essential size information for the listing shown on Figure 2 appears prominently on the first page (square footage of the offered restaurant), while non-essential size information, such as the size of the adjacent parking lot or basement, tend to appear in smaller font on subsequent flyer pages.",
        "To account for such visual characteristics we attempted to also include visual features associated with text chunks.",
        "We used the computed HTML style attributes for each DOM element containing text.",
        "Table 3 lists the computed visual features.",
        "Feature Name Description Font Size The computed font-size attribute of the surrounding HTML DOM element, normalized to 7 basic sizes (xx-small, x-small, small, medium, large, x-large, xx-large).",

        "The RGB values were normalized to a set of 100 basic colors.",
        "We converted the RGB values to the YUV color space, and then used Euclidian distance to find the most similar basic color approximating human perception.",
        "Y Coordinate The computed top attribute of the surrounding HTML DOM element, i.e. the y-coordinate in pixels.",
        "The pixel locations was normalized to 150 pixel increments (roughly 1/5th of the visible screen for the most common screen resolution.)",

        "A sliding window of 5 preceding and 5 following DOM elements were used for all features.",
        "Computing the HTML style attributes is a complex task since they are typically defined by a combination of CSS files, in-lined HTML style attributes, and browser defaults.",
        "The complexities of style definition, inheritance, and overwriting are handled by browsers 3 .",
        "We used the 3 We attempted to use an HTML renderer from the Cobra java toolkit http://lobobrowser.org/cobra.jsp to compute HTML style attributes.",
        "However, this renderer Chrome browser to compute dynamically the style of each DOM element and output it as inline style attributes.",
        "To achieve this we program-matically inserted a javascript snippet that inlines the computed style and saves the new version of the HTML on the local file system utilizing the HTML5 saveAs interface 4 .",
        "Details on how we normalized the style attribute values for font size, RGB color, and Y coordinate are shown in Table 3.",
        "We then applied Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Vapnik, 2000) on the NER task using the LibSVM library (Chang and Lin, 2011).",
        "We chose SVMs as they have been shown to perform well on a variety of NER tasks, for example (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002; Takeuchi and Collier, 2002; Mayfield et al., 2003; Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2008).",
