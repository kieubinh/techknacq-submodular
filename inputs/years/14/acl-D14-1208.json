        "Although supervised approaches to relation extraction (GuoDong et al., 2005; Surdeanu and Cia-ramita, 2007) achieve very high accuracies, they do not scale as they are data intensive and the cost of creating annotated data is quite high.",
        "To alleviate this problem, Mintz et al. (2009) proposed relation extraction in the paradigm of distant supervision.",
        "In this approach, given a database of facts (e.g. Freebase1) and an unannotated document collection, the goal is to heuristically align the facts in the database to the sentences in the corpus which contain the entities mentioned in the fact.",
        "This is done to create weakly labeled training data to train a classifier for relation extraction.",
        "The underlying assumption is that all mentions of 1www.freebase.com an entity pair2 (i.e. sentences containing the entity pair) in the corpus express the same relation as stated in the database.",
        "The above assumption is a weak one and is often violated in natural language text.",
        "For in-stance, the entity pair, (Barack Obama, United States) participate in more than one relation: citizenOf, presidentOf, bornIn and every mention expresses either one of these fixed set of relations or none of them.",
        "Consequently, a number of models have been proposed in literature to provide better heuristics for the mapping between the entity pair in the database and its mentions in the sentences of the corpus.",
        "Riedel et al. (2010) tightens the assumption of distant supervision in the following man-ner: ?Given a pair of entities and their mentions in sentences from a corpus, at least one of the mentions express the relation given in the database?.",
        "In other words, it models the problem as that of multi-instance (mentions) single-label (relation) learning.",
        "Following this, Hoffmann et al. (2011) and Surdeanu et al. (2012) propose models that consider the mapping as that of multi-instance multi-label learning.",
        "The instances are the mentions of the entity pair in the sentences of the corpus and the entity pair can participate in more than one relation.",
        "Although, these models work very well in prac-tice, they have a number of shortcomings.",
        "One of them is the possibility that during the align-ment, a fact in the database might not have an instantiation in the corpus.",
        "For instance, if our corpus only contains documents from the years 2000 to 2005, the fact presidentOf(Barack Obama, United States) will not be present in the corpus.",
        "In such cases, the distant supervision assumption fails to provide a mapping for the fact in the corpus.",
        "In this paper, we address this situation with a 2In this paper we restrict ourselves to binary relations 1937 noisy-or model (Srinivas, 2013) in training the relation extractor by relaxing the ?at least one?",
