        "The definition of what is literal and figurative is still object of debate.",
        "Ariel (2002) demonstrates that literal and non-literal meanings cannot always be distinguished from each other.",
        "Literal meaning is originally assumed to be conventional, compositional, relatively context independent, and truth conditional.",
        "The problem is that the boundary is not clear-cut, some figurative expressions are compositional ?",
        "metaphors and many idioms; others are conventional ?",
        "most of the idioms.",
        "Idioms present great challenges for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications.",
        "They can violate selection restrictions (Sporleder and Li, 2009) as in push one's luck under the assumption that only concrete things can normally be pushed.",
        "Idioms can disobey typical subcategorization constraints (e.g., in line without a determiner before line), or change the default assignments of semantic roles to syntactic categories (e.g., in X breaks something with Y, Y typically is an instrument but for the idiom break the ice, it is more likely to fill a patient role as in How to break the ice with a stranger).",
        "In addition, many potentially idiomatic expressions can be used either literally or fig-uratively, depending on the context.",
        "This presents a great challenge for machine translation.",
        "For example, a machine translation system must translate held fire differently in Now, now, hold your fire until I?ve had a chance to explain.",
        "Hold your fire, Bill.",
        "You?re too quick to complain.",
        "and The sergeant told the soldiers to hold their fire.",
        "Please hold your fire until I get out of the way.",
        "In fact, we tested the last two examples using the Google Translate engine and we got proper translations of the two neither into Russian nor into Hebrew, Span-ish, or Chinese.",
        "Most current translation systems rely on large repositories of idioms.",
        "Unfortunately, these systems are not capable to tell apart literal from figurative usage of the same expression in context.",
        "Despite the common perception that phrases that can be idioms are mainly used in their idiomatic sense, Fazly et al. (2009)'s analysis of 60 idioms has shown that close to half of these also have a clear literal meaning; and of those with a literal meaning, on average around 40% of their usages are literal.",
        "In this paper we describe an algorithm for automatic classification of idiomatic and literal expressions.",
        "Our starting point is that words in a given text segment, such as a paragraph, that are high-ranking representatives of a common topic of discussion are less likely to be a part of an idiomatic expression.",
        "Our additional hypothesis is that contexts in which idioms occur, typ-ically, are more affective and therefore, we incorporate a simple analysis of the intensity of the emotions expressed by the contexts.",
        "We investigate the bag of words topic representation of one to three paragraphs containing an expression that should be classified as idiomatic or literal (a target phrase).",
        "We extract topics from paragraphs containing idioms and from paragraphs containing literals using an unsupervised clustering method, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "Since idiomatic expressions exhibit the property of non-compositionality, we assume that they usually present different semantics than the words used 2019 in the local topic.",
        "We treat idioms as semantic outliers, and the identification of semantic shift as outlier detection.",
        "Thus, this topic representation allows us to differentiate idioms from literals using the local semantics.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 briefly describes previous approaches to idiom recognition or classification.",
        "In Section 3 we describe our approach in detail, including the hypothesis, the topic space repre-sentation, and the proposed algorithm.",
        "After describing the preprocessing procedure in Section 4, we turn to the actual experiments in Sections 5 and 6.",
        "We then compare our approach to other approaches (Section 7) and discuss the results (Section 8).",
        "2 Previous Work Previous approaches to idiom detection can be classified into two groups: 1) Type-based extraction, i.e., detecting idioms at the type level; 2) token-based detec-tion, i.e., detecting idioms in context.",
        "Type-based extraction is based on the idea that idiomatic expressions exhibit certain linguistic properties that can distinguish them from literal expressions (Sag et al. (2002); Fazly et al. (2009)), among many others, discuss various properties of idioms.",
        "Some examples of such properties include 1) lexical fixedness: e.g., neither ?shoot the wind?",
        "nor ?hit the breeze?",
        "are valid variations of the idiom shoot the breeze and 2) syntactic fixedness: e.g., The guy kicked the bucket is potentially idiomatic whereas The bucket was kicked is not idiomatic any-more; and of course, 3) non-compositionality.",
        "Thus, some approaches look at the tendency for words to occur in one particular order, or a fixed pattern.",
        "Hearst (1992) identifies lexico-syntactic patterns that occur frequently, are recognizable with little or no precoded knowledge, and indicate the lexical relation of interest.",
        "Widdows and Dorow (2005) use Hearst's concept of lexicosyntactic patterns to extract idioms that consist of fixed patterns between two nouns.",
        "Basically, their technique works by finding patterns such as ?thrills and spills?, whose reversals (such as ?spills and thrills?)",
        "are never encountered.",
        "While many idioms do have these properties, many idioms fall on the continuum from being compositional to being partly unanalyzable to completely non-compositional (Cook et al. (2007)).",
        "Fazly et al. (2009); Li and Sporleder (2010), among others, notice that type-based approaches do not work on expressions that can be interpreted idiomatically or literally depending on the context and thus, an approach that considers tokens in context is more appropriate for the task of idiom recognition.",
        "A number of token-based approaches have been discussed in the literature, both supervised (Katz and Giesbrech (2006)), weakly supervised (Birke and Sarkar (2006)) and unsupervised (Sporleder and Li (2009); Fazly et al. (2009)).",
        "Fazly et al. (2009) develop statistical measures for each linguistic property of idiomatic expressions and use them both in a type-based classification task and in a token identification task, in which they distinguish idiomatic and literal usages of potentially idiomatic expressions in context.",
        "Sporleder and Li (2009) present a graph-based model for representing the lexical cohesion of a discourse.",
        "Nodes represent tokens in the discourse, which are connected by edges whose value is determined by a semantic relatedness function.",
        "They experiment with two different approaches to semantic relatedness: 1) Dependency vectors, as described in Pad√≥ and Lapata (2007); 2) Normalized Google Distance (Cilibrasi and Vit?anyi (2007)).",
        "Sporleder and Li (2009) show that this method works better for larger contexts (greater than five para-graphs).",
        "Li and Sporleder (2010) assume that literal and figurative data are generated by two different Gaus-sians, literal and non-literal and the detection is done by comparing which Gaussian model has a higher probability to generate a specific instance.",
        "The approach assumes that the target expressions are already known and the goal is to determine whether this expression is literal or figurative in a particular context.",
        "The important insight of this method is that figurative language in general exhibits less semantic cohesive ties with the context than literal language.",
        "Feldman and Peng (2013) describe several approaches to automatic idiom identification.",
        "One of them is idiom recognition as outlier detection.",
        "They apply principal component analysis for outlier detection ?",
        "an approach that does not rely on costly annotated training data and is not limited to a specific type of a syntactic construction, and is generally language independent.",
        "The quantitative analysis provided in their work shows that the outlier detection algorithm performs better and seems promising.",
        "The qualitative analysis also shows that their algorithm has to incorporate several important properties of the idioms: (1) Idioms are relatively non-compositional, comparing to literal expressions or other types of collocations.",
        "(2) Idioms violate local cohesive ties, as a result, they are semantically distant from the local topics.",
        "(3) While not all semantic outliers are idioms, non-compositional semantic outliers are likely to be idiomatic.",
        "(4) Id-iomaticity is not a binary property.",
        "Idioms fall on the continuum from being compositional to being partly unanalyzable to completely non-compositional.",
        "The approach described below is taking Feldman and Peng (2013)'s original idea and is trying to address (2) directly and (1) indirectly.",
        "Our approach is also somewhat similar to Li and Sporleder (2010) because it also relies on a list of potentially idiomatic expressions.",
        "3 Our Hypothesis Similarly to Feldman and Peng (2013), out starting point is that idioms are semantic outliers that violate cohesive structure, especially in local contexts.",
        "How-ever, our task is framed as supervised classification and we rely on data annotated for idiomatic and literal expressions.",
        "We hypothesize that words in a given text 2020 segment, such as a paragraph, that are high-ranking representatives of a common topic of discussion are less likely to be a part of an idiomatic expression in the document.",
        "3.1 Topic Space Representation Instead of the simple bag of words representation of a target document (segment of three paragraphs that contains a target phrase), we investigate the bag of words topic representation for target documents.",
        "That is, we extract topics from paragraphs containing idioms and from paragraphs containing literals using an unsupervised clustering method, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "The idea is that if the LDA model is able to capture the semantics of a target docu-ment, an idiomatic phrase will be a ?semantic?",
        "outlier of the themes.",
        "Thus, this topic representation will allow us to differentiate idioms from literals using the semantics of the local context.",
        "Let d = {w 1 , ?",
        "?",
        "?",
        ", w N } t be a segment (document) containing a target phrase, where N denotes the number of terms in a given corpus, and t represents transpose.",
        "We first compute a set of m topics from d. We denote this set by T (d) = {t 1 , ?",
        "?",
        "?",

        "?",
        "?",
        ", w k ) t .",
        "Here w j represents a word from a vocabulary of W words.",
        "Thus, we have two representations for d: (1) d, represented by its original terms, and (2) ?",
        "d, represented by its topic terms.",
        "Two corresponding term by document matrices will be denoted by M D and M ?",
        "D , respectively, where D denotes a set of documents.",
        "That is, M D represents the original ?text?",
        "term by document matrix, while M ?",
        "D represents the ?topic?",
        "term by document matrix.",
        "Figure 1 shows the potential benefit of topic space representation.",
        "In the figure, text segments containing target phrase ?blow whistle?",
        "are projected on a two dimensional subspace.",
        "The left figure shows the projection in the ?text?",
        "space, represented by the term by document matrixM D .",
        "The middle figure shows the projection in the topic space, represented by M ?",
        "D .",
        "The topic space representation seems to provide a better separation.",
        "We note that when learning topics from a small data sample, learned topics can be less coherent and inter-pretable, thus less useful.",
        "To address this issue, regularized LDA has been proposed in the literature (New- man et al., 2011).",
        "A key feature is to favor words that exhibit short range dependencies for a given topic.",
        "We can achieve a similar effect by placing restrictions on the vocabulary.",
        "For example, when extracting topics from segments containing idioms, we may restrict the vocabulary to contain words from these segments only.",
        "The middle and right figures in Figure 1 illustrate a case in point.",
        "The middle figure shows a projection onto the topic space that is computed with a restricted vocabu-lary, while the right figure shows a projection when we place no restriction on the vocabulary.",
        "That is, the vocabulary includes terms from documents that contain both idioms and literals.",
        "Note that by computing M ?",
        "D , the topic term by document matrix, from the training data, we have created a vocabulary, or a set of ?features?",
        "(i.e., topic terms) that is used to directly describe a query or test segment.",
        "The main advantage is that topics are more accurate when computed by LDA from a large collection of idiomatic or literal contexts.",
        "Thus, these topics capture more accurately the semantic contexts in which the target idiomatic and literal expressions typically occur.",
        "If a target query appears in a similar semantic context, the topics will be able to describe this query as well.",
        "On the other hand, one might similarly apply LDA to a given query to extract query topics, and create the query vector from the query topics.",
        "The main disadvantage is that LDA may not be able to extract topic terms that match well with those in the training corpus, when applied to the query in isolation.",
