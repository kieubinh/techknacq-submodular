        "Classical phrase-based translation models rely heavily on the language model and the reordering model to capture dependencies between phrases.",
        "Sequence models over Minimum Translation Units (MTUs) have been shown to complement both syntax-based (Quirk and Menezes, 2006) as well as phrase-based (Zhang et al., 2013) models by explicitly modeling relationships between phrases.",
        "MTU models have been traditionally estimated using standard back-off n-gram techniques (Quirk and Menezes, 2006; Crego and Yvon, 2010; Zhang et al., 2013), similar to word-based language models (?2).",
        "However, the estimation of higher-order n-gram models becomes increasingly difficult due to data sparsity issues associated with large n-grams, even when training on over one hundred billion words (Heafield et al., 2013); bilingual units are much sparser than words and are therefore even harder to estimate.",
        "Another drawback of n-gram models is that future predictions are based on a limited amount of previous context that is often not sufficient to capture important aspects of human language (Rastrow et al., 2012).",
        "Recently, several feed-forward neural network-based models have achieved impressive improvements over traditional back-off n-gram models in language modeling (Bengio et al., 2003; Schwenk et al., 2007; Schwenk et al., 2012; Vaswani et al., 2013), as well as translation modeling (Allauzen et al., 2011; Le et al., 2012; Gao et al., 2013).",
        "These models tackle the data sparsity problem by representing words in continuous space rather than as discrete units.",
        "Similar words are grouped in the same sub-space rather than being treated as separate entities.",
        "Neural network models can be seen as functions over continuous representations exploiting the similarity between words, thereby making the estimation of probabilities over higher-order n-grams easier.",
        "However, feed-forward networks do not directly address the limited context issue either, since predictions are based on a fixed-size context, similar to back-off n-gram models.",
        "We therefore focus in this paper on recurrent neural network architec-tures, which address the limited context issue by basing predictions on an unbounded history of previous events which allows to capture long-span dependencies.",
        "Recurrent architectures have recently advanced the state of the art in language modeling (Mikolov et al., 2010; Mikolov et al., 2011a; Mikolov, 2012) outperforming multi-layer feed-forward based networks in perplexity and word error rate for speech recognition (Arisoy et al., 2012; Sundermeyer et al., 2013).",
        "Recent work has also shown successful applications to machine translation (Mikolov, 2012; Auli et al., 2013; Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013).",
        "We extend this work by modeling Minimum Translation Units with recurrent neural networks.",

        "Our first approach frames the problem as a sequence modeling task over minimal units (?3).",
        "The second model improves over the first by modeling an MTU as a bag-of-words, thereby allowing us to learn representations over sub-structures of minimal units that are shared across MTUs (?4).",
        "Our models significantly outperform the traditional back-off n-gram based approach and we show that they act complementary to a very strong recurrent neural network-based language model based solely on target words (?5).",
        "2 Minimum Translation Units Banchs et al. (2005) introduced the idea of framing translation as a sequence modeling problem where a sentence pair is generated in left-to-right order as a sequence of bilingual n-grams.",
        "Minimum Translation Units (Quirk and Menezes, 2006; Zhang et al., 2013) are an extension which additionally permit tuples with empty source or target sides, thereby allowing insertion or deletion phrase pairs.",
        "The two basic requirements for MTUs are that there are no overlapping word alignment links between phrase pairs and it should not be possible to extract smaller phrase pairs without violating the word alignment constraints.",
        "Informally, we can think of MTUs as small phrase pairs that cannot be broken down any further without violating the two requirements.",
        "Minimum Translation Units partition a sentence pair into a set of minimal bilingual units or tu-Words MTUs Tokens 34,769,416 14,853,062 Types 143,524 1,315,512 Singleton types 34.9% 80.1% Table 1: Token and type counts for both source and target words as well as MTUs based on the WMT 2006 German to English data set (cf. ?5).",
        "ples obtained by an algorithm similar to phrase-extraction (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "Figure 1 illustrates such a partitioning.",
        "Modeling minimal units has two advantages over considering larger phrase pairs that are effectively composed of MTUs: First, minimal units result in a unique partitioning of a sentence pair.",
        "This has the advantage that we avoid modeling spurious derivations, that is, multiple derivations generating the same sentence pair.",
        "Second, minimal units result in smaller models with a smoother distribution than models based on composed units (Zhang et al., 2013).",
        "Sentence pairs can be generated in multiple or-ders, such as left-to-right or right-to-left, either in source or target order.",
        "For example, the source left-to-right order of the sentence pair in Figure 1 is simply M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, while the target left-to-right order is M3, M4, M5, M1, M2.",
        "We deal with inserted or deleted words similar to Zhang et al. (2013): The source side null token of an inserted target phrase is placed next to the last source word aligned to the closest preceding non-null aligned target phrase; a similar rule is applied to null tokens on the target side.",
        "For example, in Figure 1 we place M4 straight after M3 because ?the?, the aligned target phrase, is after ?held?, the previous non-null aligned target phrase.",
        "We can straightforwardly estimate an n-gram model over MTUs to estimate the probability of a sentence pair using standard back-off techniques commonly employed in language mod-eling.",
        "For example, a trigram model in target left-to-right order factors the sentence pair in Figure 1 as p(M3) p(M4|M3) p(M5|M3,M4) p(M1|M4,M5)p(M2|M5,M1).",
        "If we would like to model larger contexts, then we quickly run into data sparsity issues.",
        "To illustrate this point, consider the parameter growth of an n-gram model which is driven by the vocabulary size |V | and the n-gram order n: O(|V | n ).",
        "Clearly, the exact estimation of higher-order n-21 gram probabilities becomes more difficult with large n, leading to the estimation of events with increasingly sparse statistics, or having to rely on statistics from lower-order events with back-off models, which is less desirable.",
        "Even word-based language models rarely ventured so far much beyond 5-gram statistics as demonstrated by Heafield et al. (2013) who trained a, by to-day's standards, very large 5-gram model on 130B words.",
        "Data sparsity is therefore an even more significant issue for MTU models relying on much larger vocabularies.",
        "In our setting, the MTU vocabulary is an order of magnitude larger than a word vocabulary obtained from the same data (Ta- ble 1).",
        "Furthermore, most MTUs are observed only once making the reliable estimation of probabilities very challenging.",
        "Neural network-based sequence models tackle the data sparsity problem by learning continuous word representations, that group similar words together in continuous space.",
        "For example, the distributional representations induced by recurrent neural networks have been found to have interesting syntactic and semantic regularities (Mikolov et al., 2013).",
        "Furthermore, these representations can be exploited to estimate more reliable statistics over higher-order n-grams than with discrete word units.",
        "Recurrent neural networks go beyond fixed-size contexts and allow the model to keep track of long-span dependencies that are important for future predictions.",
        "In the next sections we will present Minimum Translation Unit models based on recurrent architectures.",
        "3 Atomic MTU RNN Model The first model we introduce is based on the recurrent neural network language model of Mikolov et al. (2010).",
        "We frame the problem as a traditional sequence modeling task which treats MTUs as atomic units, similar to the approach taken by the traditional back-off n-gram models.",
        "The model is factored into an input layer, a hidden layer with recurrent connections, and an output layer (Figure 2).",
        "The input layer encodes the MTU at time t as a 1-of-N vector m t with all values being zero except for the entry representing the MTU.",
        "The output layer y t represents a probability distribution over possible next MTUs; both the input and output layers are of size |V |, the size of the MTU vocabulary.",

        "sequence up to time step t. The state of the hidden layer is determined by the input layer and the hidden layer configuration of the previous time step h t?1 .",
        "The weights of the connections between the layers are summarized in a number of matrices: U represents weights from the input layer to the hidden layer, and W represents connections from the previous hidden layer to the current hidden layer.",
        "Matrix V contains weights between the current hidden layer and the output layer.",
        "The hidden and output layers are computed via a series of matrix-vector products and non-linearities: h t = s(Um t +Wh t?1 ) y t = g(Vh t ) where s(z) = 1 1 + exp {?z} , g(z m ) = exp {z m } ?",
        "k exp {z k } are sigmoid and softmax functions, respectively.",
        "Additionally, the network is interpolated with a maximum entropy model of sparse n-gram features over input MTUs (Mikolov et al., 2011a).",
        "The maximum entropy weights D are added to the output activations before applying the softmax function and are estimated jointly with all other parameters (Figure 3).",

        "The model is optimized via a maximum likelihood objective function using stochastic gradient descent.",
        "Training is based on the truncated back propagation through time algorithm, which unrolls the network and then computes error gradients over multiple time steps (Rumelhart et al., 1986); we use a cross entropy criterion to obtain the error vector with respect to the output activations and the desired prediction.",

        "4 Bag-of-words MTU RNN Model The previous model treats MTUs as atomic symbols which leads to large vocabularies requiring large parameter sets and expensive inference.",
        "However, similar MTUs may share the same words, or words which are related in continuous space.",
        "The atomic MTU model does not exploit this since it cannot access the internal structure of a minimal unit.",
        "The approach we pursue next is to break MTUs into individual source and target words (Le et al., 2012) in order to exploit structural similarities between infrequently observed minimal units.",
        "Singletons represent the vast majority of our MTU vocabulary (Table 1).",
        "This resembles the word-hashing trick of Huang et al. (2013) who represented individual words as a bag-of-character n-grams to reduce the vocabulary size of a neural network-based model in an information retrieval setting.",
        "2 We first describe a theoretically appealing but computationally expensive model and then discuss a more practical variation.",
        "The input layer of this model accepts the current minimal unit as a K-of-N vector representing K source and target words as opposed to the 1-of-N encoding of entire MTUs in the previous model (Figure 4).",
        "Larger MTUs may contain the same word more than once and we simply adjust their count to one.",
        "3 Different to the 2 Applying the same technique would likely result in too many collisions since we are dealing with multi-word units instead of single words.",

        "previous model, the input vector has now multiple active entries whose signals are absorbed into the new hidden layer configuration.",
        "This bag-of-words encoding of minimal units dramatically reduces the vocabulary size but it inevitably maps different MTUs to the same encoding.",
        "On our data set, we observe less than 0.2% of minimal units that are involved in collisions, a rate that is similar to Huang et al. (2013).",
        "In practice collisions are unlikely to affect accuracy in our setting because MTUs that are mapped to the same encoding usually do not differ much in semantic meaning as illustrated by the following examples: erfolg haben ?",
        "succeed collides with haben er-folg?",

        "to and , damit?",
        "to; in both examples either the auxiliary verb haben or the comma changes position, neither of which significantly changes the meaning for this particular pair of MTUs.",
        "The structure of the bag-of-words MTU RNN models is shown in Figure 4.",
        "Similar to the atomic MTU RNN model (?3), the hidden layer combines the signal from the input layer and the previous hidden layer configuration.",
        "The hidden layer activations feed into a word layer w t representing the source and target words that part of all possible MTUs; it is of the same size as the input layer.",
        "The word layer is connected to a convolutional output layer y t by weights summarized in the sparse matrix C. The output layer represents all possible next minimal units, where each MTU entry is only connected to neurons in the word layer representing its source and target words.",
        "The word and MTU layers are then computed as follows: w t = s(Vh t ) y t = g(Cw t ) However, there are a number of computational issues with this model: First, we cannot efficiently factor the word layer w t into classes such as for the atomic MTU RNN model because we require all its activations to compute the MTU output layer y t .",
        "This reduces the best case complexity of computing the word layer from O( ?",
        "|V |) back to linear in the number of source and target words |V |.",
        "In practice this results in between 200-1000 more activations that need to be com-puted, depending on the word vocabulary size.",
        "Second, turning the MTU output layer into a convolutional layer is not enough to sufficiently reduce the computational effort to compute the output activations since the number of connections between the word and MTU layers is very imbalanced.",
        "This is because frequent words, such as function words, are part of many MTUs and therefore have a very high out-degree, e.g., the neuron representing ?the?",
        "has over 82K outgoing edges.",
        "On the other hand, infrequent words, have a very low out-degree.",
        "This imbalance makes it hard to efficiently compute activations and error gradi-ents, even on a GPU, since some neurons require substantially more work than others.",
        "4 For these reasons we decided to design a sim-pler, more tractable version of this model (Fig- ure 5).",
        "The simplified model still represents an input MTU as a bag-of-words but minimal units are generated word-by-word, first emitting source words and then target words.",
        "This is in contrast to the original model which predicted an MTU as a single unit.",
        "Decomposing the next MTU into individual words dramatically reduces the size of the output layer, thereby resulting in faster computation of the outputs and making normalization 4 In initial experiments we found this model to be over twenty times slower than the atomic MTU RNN model with estimated training times of over 6 weeks.",
        "This was despite using a vastly smaller vocabulary and by computing the word layer on a, by current standards, high-end GPU (NVIDIA Tesla K20c) using sparse matrix optimizations (cuSPARSE) for the convolutional layer.",

        "The atomic MTU RNN model improves over the n-gram MTU model on all test sets for German to English, however, for French to English the back-off model performs better on two out of four test sets.",
        "The next question we answer is if breaking MTUs into individual units to leverage similarities in the internal structure can help accuracy.",
        "The results (Table 2 and Table 3) for the bag-of-words model (BoW MTU RNN) clearly show that this is the case for both language pairs.",

        "We observe gains of up to 0.5 BLEU over the n-gram MTU model for German to English as well as French to English; improvements over the decoder baseline are up to 1.2 BLEU for French to English.",
        "How do our models compare to other neural network approaches that rely only on target side in-formation?",
        "To answer this question we compare to the strong language model of Mikolov (2012; RNNLM) which has recently improved the state-of-the-art in language modeling perplexity.",
        "The results (Table 2 and Table 3) show that RNNLM performs competitively.",
        "However, our approaches model translation since we use both source and target information as opposed to scoring only the fluency of the target side, such as done by RNNLM.",
        "Can our models act complementary to a strong RNN language model?",

        "Overall, we improve accuracy on the French to English task by up to 1.5 BLEU over the decoder 1-best, and by up to 0.8 BLEU over the n-gram MTU model.",
        "6 Related Work Our approach of modeling Minimum Translation Units is very much in line with recent work on n-gram-based translation models (Crego and Yvon, 2010), and more recently, continuous space-based translation models (Le et al., 2012).",
        "The models presented in this paper differ in a number of key aspects: We use a recurrent architecture representing an unbounded history of MTUs rather than a feed-forward style network.",
        "Feed-forward networks as well as back-off n-gram models rely on a finite history which results in predictions independent of anything but a short context of words.",
        "A recent side-by-side comparison between recurrent and feed-forward style neural networks (Sunder- meyer et al., 2013) has shown that recurrent architectures outperform feed-forward networks in a language modeling task, a similar problem to modeling sequences over Minimum Translation Units.",
        "Furthermore, the input of our best model is a bag-of-words representation of an MTU, unlike the ordered source and target word n-grams used by Crego and Yvon (2010) as well as Le et al. (2012).",
        "Finally, we model both source and target words in a single recurrent neural network.",
        "The approach of Le et al. (2012) factorizes the joint probability over an MTU sequence in a way that suggests the use of separate neural network models for the source and the target sides, where each model generates words on the respective side only.",
        "Other work on applying recurrent neural networks to machine translation (Mikolov, 2012; Auli et al., 2013; Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013) concentrated on word-based language and translation models, whereas we model Minimum Translation Units.",
        "7 Conclusion and Future Work Minimum Translation Unit models based on recurrent neural networks lead to substantial gains over their classical n-gram back-off models.",
        "We introduced two models of which the best improves accuracy by up to 1.5 BLEU over the 1-best decoder output, and by 0.8 BLEU over a trigram MTU model in an n-best rescoring setting.",
        "Our experiments have shown that representing MTUs as bags-of-words leads to better accuracy since this exploits similarities in the internal structure of Minimum Translation Units, which is not possible when modeling them as atomic symbols.",
        "We have also shown that our models are complementary to a very strong RNN language model (Mikolov, 2012).",
        "In future work, we would like to make the initial version of the bag-of-words model computationally more tractable using a better GPU implementation.",
        "This model combines the efficient bag-of-words input representation with the ability to predict MTUs as single units while explicitly modeling the constituent words in an intermediate layer.",
