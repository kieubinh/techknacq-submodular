        "Semantic frames are indispensable knowledge for semantic analysis or text understanding.",
        "In the last decade, semantic frames, such as FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005), have been manually elaborated.",
        "These resources are effectively exploited in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including not only semantic parsing but also machine translation (Boas, 2002), information extraction (Surdeanu et al., 2003), question answering (Narayanan and Harabagiu, 2004), paraphrase acquisition (Ellsworth and Janin, 2007) and recognition of textual entailment (Burchardt and Frank, 2006).",
        "There have been many attempts to automatically acquire frame knowledge from raw corpora with the goal of either adding frequency information to an existing resource or of inducing similar frames for other languages.",
        "Most of these ap-proaches, however, focus on syntactic frames, i.e., subcategorization frames (e.g., (Manning, 1993; Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Korhonen et al., 2006; Lippincott et al., 2012; Reichart and Korhonen, 2013)).",
        "Since subcategorization frames represent argument patterns of verbs and are purely syn-tactic, expressions that have the same subcategorization frame can have different meanings (e.g., metaphors).",
        "Semantics-oriented NLP applications based on frames, such as paraphrase acquisition and machine translation, require consistency in the meaning of each frame, and thus these subcategorization frames are not suitable for these semantic tasks.",
        "Recently, there have been a few studies on automatically acquiring semantic frames (Materna, 2012; Materna, 2013).",
        "Materna induced semantic frames (called LDA-Frames) from triples of (subject, verb, object) in the British National Corpus (BNC) based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and the Dirichlet Process.",
        "LDA-Frames capture limited linguistic phenomena of these triples, and are defined across verbs based on probabilistic topic distributions.",
        "This paper presents a method for automatically building verb-specific semantic frames from a large raw corpus.",
        "Our semantic frames are verb-specific like PropBank and semantically distinguished.",
        "A frame has several syntactic case slots, each of which consists of words that are eligible to fill the slot.",
        "For example, let us show three semantic frames of the verb ?observe?",
        ": 1 observe:1 nsubj:{we, author, ...} dobj:{effect, result, ...} prep in:{study, case, ...} ... observe:2 nsubj:{teacher, we, ...} dobj:{child, student, ...} prep in:{classroom, school, ...} ... observe:3 nsubj:{child, people, ...} dobj:{bird, animal, ...} prep at:{range, time, ...} ... 1 In this paper, we use the dependency relation names of the Stanford collapsed dependencies (de Marneffe et al., 2006) as the notations of case slots.",
        "For instance, ?nsubj?",
        "means a nominal subject, ?dobj?",
        "means a direct object, ?iboj?",
        "means an indirect object, ?ccomp?",
        "means a clausal complement and ?prep *?",
        "means a preposition.",
        "58 Frequencies, which are not shown in the above ex-amples, are attached to each semantic frame, case slot and word, and can be effectively exploited for the applications of these semantic frames.",
        "The frequencies of words in each case slot become good sources of selectional preferences.",
        "Our novel contributions are summarized as fol-lows: ?",
        "induction of semantic frames based on the Chinese Restaurant Process (Aldous, 1985) from only automatic parses of a web-scale corpus, ?",
        "exploitation of the assumption of one sense per collocation (Yarowsky, 1993) to make the computation feasible, ?",
        "providing broad-coverage knowledge for selectional preferences, and ?",
        "evaluating induced semantic frames by using an existing annotated corpus with verb classes.",
        "2 Related Work The most closely related work to our semantic frames are LDA-Frames, which are probabilistic semantic frames automatically induced from a raw corpus (Materna, 2012; Materna, 2013).",
        "He used a model based on LDA and the Dirichlet Process to cluster verb instances of a triple (subject, verb, ob-ject) to produce semantic frames and slots.",
        "Both of these are represented as a probabilistic distribution of words across verbs.",
        "He applied this method to the BNC and acquired 427 frames and 144 slots (Materna, 2013).",
        "These frames are over-generalized across verbs and might be difficult to provide with fine-grained selectional preferences.",
        "In addition, Grenager and Manning (2006) proposed a method for inducing PropBank-style frames from Stanford typed dependencies extracted from raw corpora.",
        "Although these frames are based on typed dependencies and more semantic than subcategorization frames, they are not distinguished in terms of the senses of words filling a case slot.",
        "There are hand-crafted semantic frames in the lexicons of FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005).",
        "Corpus Pattern Analysis (CPA) frames (Hanks, 2012) are another manually created repository of patterns for verbs.",
        "Each pattern represents a prototypical word usage as extracted by lexicographers from the BNC.",
        "Creating CPA is time consuming, but our proposed method may be employed to assist in the creation of this type of resource, as shown in Section 4.4.",
        "Our task can be regarded as clustering of verb instances.",
        "In this respect, the models of Parisien and Stevenson are related to our method (Parisien and Stevenson, 2009; Parisien and Stevenson, 2010).",
        "Parisien and Stevenson (2009) proposed a Dirichlet Process model for clustering usages of the verb ?get.?",
        "Later, Parisien and Stevenson (2010) proposed a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process model for jointly clustering argument structures (i.e., subcategorization frames) and verb classes.",
        "However, their argument structures are not semantic but syntactic, and also they did not evaluate the resulting frames.",
        "There have also been related approaches to clustering verb types (Vlachos et al., 2009; Sun and Korhonen, 2009; Falk et al., 2012; Reichart and Korhonen, 2013).",
        "These methods induce verb clusters in which multiple verbs partic-ipate, and do not consider the polysemy of verbs.",
        "Our objective is different from theirs.",
        "Another line of related work is unsupervised semantic parsing or semantic role labeling (Poon and Domingos, 2009; Lang and Lapata, 2010; Lang and Lapata, 2011a; Lang and Lapata, 2011b; Titov and Klementiev, 2011; Titov and Klemen-tiev, 2012).",
        "These approaches basically cluster predicates and their arguments to distinguish predicate senses and semantic roles of arguments.",
        "Modi et al. (2012) extended the model of Titov and Klementiev (2012) to jointly induce semantic roles and frames using the Chinese Restaurant Process, which is also used in our approach.",
        "However, they did not aim at building a lexicon of semantic frames, but at distinguishing verbs that have different senses in a relatively small annotated corpus.",
        "Applying this method to a large corpus could produce a frame lexicon, but its scalability would be a big problem.",
        "For other languages than English, Kawahara and Kurohashi (2006a) proposed a method for automatically compiling Japanese semantic frames from a large web corpus.",
        "They applied conventional agglomerative clustering to predicate-argument structures using word/frame similarity based on a manually-crafted thesaurus.",
        "Since Japanese is head-final and has case-marking post-positions, it seems easier to build semantic frames with it than with other languages such as English.",
        "They also achieved an improvement in dependency parsing and predicate-argument structure 59 analysis by using their resulting frames (Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2006b).",
        "3 Method for Inducing Semantic Frames Our objective is to automatically induce verb-specific example-based semantic frames.",
        "Each semantic frame consists of a partial set of syntactic slots: nsubj, dobj, iobj, ccomp and prep *.",
        "Each slot consists of words with frequencies, which could provide broad-coverage selectional preferences.",
        "Frames for a verb should be semantically distinguished.",
        "That is to say, each frame should consist of predicate-argument structures that have consistent usages or meanings.",
        "Our procedure to automatically generate semantic frames from verb usages is as follows: 1. apply dependency parsing to a raw corpus and extract predicate-argument structures for each verb from the automatic parses, 2. merge the predicate-argument structures that have presumably the same meaning based on the assumption of one sense per collocation to get a set of initial frames, and 3. apply clustering to the initial frames based on the Chinese Restaurant Process to produce the final semantic frames.",
        "Each of these steps is described in the following sections in detail.",
        "3.1 Extracting Predicate-argument Structures from a Raw Corpus We first apply dependency parsing to a large raw corpus.",
        "We use the Stanford parser with Stanford dependencies (de Marneffe et al., 2006).",
        "2 Collapsed dependencies are adopted to directly extract prepositional phrases.",
        "Then, we extract predicate-argument structures from the dependency parses.",
        "Dependents that have the following dependency relations to a verb are extracted as arguments: nsubj, xsubj, dobj, iobj, ccomp, xcomp, prep ?",
        "Here, we do not distinguish adjuncts from arguments.",
        "All extracted dependents of a verb are handled as arguments.",

        "Since our objective is to compile broad-coverage semantic frames, a massive amount of predicate-argument structures should be fed into the clustering.",
        "It would take prohibitive computational costs to conduct the sampling pro-cedure, which is described in the next section.",
        "To make the computation feasible, we merge the predicate-argument structures that have the same or similar meaning to get initial frames.",
        "These initial frames are the input of the subsequent clustering process.",
        "For this merge, we assume one sense per collocation (Yarowsky, 1993) for predicate-argument structures.",
        "For each predicate-argument structure of a verb, we couple the verb and an argument to make a unit for sense disambiguation.",
        "We select an argument in the following order by considering the degree of effect on the verb sense: 3 dobj, ccomp, nsubj, prep ?, iobj.",
        "This selection of a predominant argument order above is justified by relative comparisons of the discriminative power of the different slots for CPA frames (Popescu, 2013).",
        "If a predicate-argument structure does not have any of the above slots, it is discarded.",
        "Then, the predicate-argument structures that have the same verb and argument pair (slot and 3 If a predicate-argument structure has multiple prepositional phrases, one of them is randomly selected.",
        "word, e.g., ?dobj:effect?)",
        "are merged into an initial frame (Figure 1).",
        "After this process, we discard minor initial frames that occur fewer than 10 times.",
        "For example, we have 732,292 instances (predicate-argument structures) for the verb ?ob- serve?",
        "in the web corpus that is used in our experiment (its details are described in Section 4.1).",
        "As the result of this merging process, we obtain 6,530 initial frames, which become an input for the clustering.",
        "This means that this process accelerates the speed of clustering more than 100 times.",
        "The precision of this process will be evaluated in Section 4.3.",

        "[Human 1] accommodate [Human 2] [Building] accommodate [Eventuality] [Human] accommodate [Self] to [Eventuality] In this paper, we use CPA to evaluate the quality of the automatically induced frames.",
        "By comparing the induced frames to CPA patterns, we can evaluate the correctness and relevance of this approach from a human point of view.",
        "To do that, we associate semantic features to the set of words in each slot in the frames, using SUMO (Niles and Pease, 2001).",

        "First, we did not limit the evaluation to the most frequent patterns.",
        "Second, the mapping was carried out automatically and not by hand.",
        "The results above compare favorably with the previous approaches, especially considering that no filtering procedures were applied to the induced frames.",
        "We anticipate that the results based on the prototypical induced frames with SUMO attributes would be competitive.",
        "Our post-analysis revealed that the entropy can be lowered further if an automatic filtering based on frequencies is applied.",
        "4.5 Evaluation of the Quality of Selectional Preferences We also investigated the quality of selectional preferences within the induced semantic frames.",
        "The only publicly available test data for selectional preferences, to our knowledge, is from Chambers and Jurafsky (2010).",
        "This data consists of quadruples (verb, relation, word, confounder) and does not contain their context.",
        "7 A typical way for using our semantic frames is to select an appropriate frame for an input sentence and judge the eligibility of the word uses against the selected frame.",
        "However, due to the lack of context for the above data, it is difficult to select a corresponding semantic frame for a test quadruple and thus the induced semantic frames cannot be naturally applied to this data.",
        "To investigate the potential for selectional preferences of the semantic frames, we approximately match a quadruple with each of the semantic frames of the verb and select the frame that has the highest probability as follows: P (w) = max i P (w|v, rel, f i ), (8) where w is the word or confounder, v is the verb, rel is the relation and f i is a semantic frame.",
        "By comparing the probabilities of the word and the confounder, we select either of them according to the higher probability.",
        "For tie breaking in the case that no frames are found for the verb or both the word and confounder are not found in the case slot, we randomly select either of them in the same way as Chambers and Jurafsky (2010).",

        "5 Conclusion This paper has described an unsupervised method for inducing semantic frames from instances of each verb in giga-word corpora.",
        "This method is clustering based on the Chinese Restaurant Process.",
        "The resulting frame data are open to the public and also can be searched by inputting a verb via our web interface.",
