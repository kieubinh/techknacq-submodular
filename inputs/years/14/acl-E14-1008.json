        "Sense annotated corpora are important resources in NLP as they can be used as training data (e.g., for word sense disambiguation (WSD) or semantic role labelling) or as sources for the acquisition of lexical information (e.g., selectional preference in-formation).",
        "Typically, a particular sense inventory from a lexical resource is used to annotate some or all words with word senses from this sense inventory.",
        "For instance, various sense-annotated corpora based on WordNet (WN; (Fellbaum, 1998)) exist, such as the data from the Senseval competi-tions, 1 or the SemCor corpus.",
        "2 Such corpora are usually created manually which is expensive and time consuming.",
        "Furthermore, the corpora are often domain specific (e.g. newspaper texts) which makes statistical systems trained on them strongly biased.",
        "We present a novel approach for creating sense annotated corpora automatically.",
        "Our approach 1 http://www.senseval.org 2 http://www.cse.unt.edu/ ?",
        "rada/ downloads.html#semcor employs shallow syntactico-semantic patterns derived from linked lexical resources (LLRs) to automatically identify instances of word senses in text corpora.",
        "We significantly extend previous work on this task by making two important contributions: (i) we employ a large-scale LLR for automatically creating sense annotated data and (ii) we perform meaningful intrinsic and application-based evaluations of our method on large sense annotated datasets.",
        "LLRs are the result of integrating several lexical-semantic resources by linking them at the word sense level.",
        "Examples of large LLRs are the multilingual BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012), an integration of wordnets and Wikipedia 3 , or UBY, (Gurevych et al., 2012), the resource we employ in our work here.",
        "UBY is an integration of multiple resources, such as wordnets, Wikipedia, Wiktionary (WKT) 4 , FrameNet (FN; (Baker et al., 1998)) and VerbNet (VN; (Kipper et al., 2008)) for English and German.",
        "A distinguishing feature of LLRs is the enriched sense representation for word senses that are interlinked since different resources provide differ-ent, often complementary information.",
        "Annotating corpora with such enriched sense representations turns them into versatile training data for statistical systems.",
        "Our first contribution (i) also addresses a considerable gap in recent research regarding automated sense labelling of verbs.",
        "Most previous work is done on nouns.",
        "However, verbs pose a bigger challenge due to their high polysemy and the fact that, unlike nouns, syntax is of crucial importance because it often reflects particular aspects of verb meaning.",
        "That is why, here we focus on verbs and present results and evaluations for this previously neglected part-of-speech (POS).",
        "Our method, however, can be applied to other parts-of 3 http://www.wikipedia.org 4 http://www.wiktionary.org 68 speech as well.",
        "Regarding (ii), we are the first to perform meaningful intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations of automatically labelled data on a larger scale.",
        "The intrinsic evaluation measures the performance of our method on the manually annotated SemCor corpus.",
        "The extrinsic evaluation compares the performance of a classifier for verb sense disambiguation (VSD) which has been trained (a) on automatically sense labelled data and (b) on manually annotated data.",
        "Both settings achieve very similar results which means that competitive VSD can be performed without the need of costly manually created training data.",
        "This could be beneficial in languages (e.g., German, Spanish) for which elaborate lexical-semantic resources exist but large, high-quality sense annotated corpora are unavailable.",
        "Moreover, we experiment with various linkings between lexical resources in order to investigate how different resource combinations affect the performance of automated sense labelling.",
        "We show that combining all available resources might not be the best option.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organised as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents our method.",
        "Section 3 describes the data used in the experiments.",
        "Section 4 presents the results of the evaluations.",
        "Section 5 analyses in detail the differences between our method and previous work.",
        "Section 6 concludes the paper.",
        "2 Automated Labelling of Verb Senses This section describes our novel approach for automated sense labelling of verbs in a corpus, which exploits the added value of LLRs.",
        "2.1 Approach Our approach to automatically label corpus instances of verb senses with sense identifiers from an LLR is based on a pattern-based representation of verb senses.",
        "Such patterns constitute a common format for the representation of verb senses available in LLRs and verb instances found in corpora.",
        "The common format we developed resembles a syntactico-semantic clause pattern which we call a sense pattern (SP).",
        "Based on a comparison of the derived SPs by means of a similarity metric, verb instances in a corpus can automatically be labelled with sense identifiers from an LLR.",
        "SPs can be derived from corpus instances and from information given in LLRs, in particular, sense examples and more abstract predicate argument structure information.",
        "2.2 Step 1: Creation of SPs from LLRs For the creation of SPs, we employ the large-scale LLR UBY which combines 10 lexical resources for English and German to make use of the enriched verb sense representations provided by the sense links between various resources available in UBY.",
        "Although our method can work with any LLR, we choose UBY because the various resources are represented in a standardised format (Eckle-Kohler et al., 2012) and sense links between them can uniformly and conveniently be accessed via the freely available UBY-API.",
        "5 Since we evaluate our method on data annotated with WN senses, we create SPs for enriched WN senses (see example given in Table 1).",
        "We enrich WN senses by aggregating lexical information that can be accessed through links given in UBY to corresponding verb senses in other resources.",
        "In this setting, enrichment means that we make use of sense examples from WN, from FN via the WN?FN linking, and from WKT via the WN?WKT linking.",
        "In addition, we use abstract predicate-argument structure information from VN via the WN?VN linking (see Table 1).",
        "6 For phrasal verb senses (e.g., write up) and other verbal multiword expressions (e.g., know what's going on) listed in WN, UBY rarely provides links to other resources.",
        "Therefore, we induced sense links by following the one sense per collocation assumption.",
        "7 Based on this assump-tion, we linked each sense of a verbal multiword verb lemma in WN with each sense of the same multiword lemma in FN and WKT.",
        "From sense examples, we derive two different kinds of SPs.",
        "Based on a fragment of a sense example given by a window w around the target verb lemma we create: (i) lemma SPs (LSPs) consisting only of lemmas (including the target verb) and (ii) abstract SPs (ASPs) consisting of the target verb lemma and items from a fixed, linguistically motivated vocabulary.",
        "This is based on the intuition that LSPs are important to identify relatively fixed 5 http://code.google.com/p/uby/ 6 Although VN is linked to sense examples given in the PropBank corpus, the rationale behind using just abstract predicate-argument structure information was to explore, which effect this type of information has on the performance of an automated labelling algorithm.",
        "7 It assumes that nearby words provide strong and consistent clues to the sense of a target word, see Yarowsky (1995).",

        "verbal multiword expressions in a corpus, whereas ASPs are necessary to identify productively used verb senses that are constrained in their use only by their syntactic behaviour and particular semantic properties, such as selectional preferences on their arguments.",
        "The fixed vocabulary used for the creation of ASPs consists of (i) the target verb lemma, (ii) selected POS tags from the Penn Treebank Tagset (Marcus et al., 1993), (iii) a list of particular function words that play an important role in fine-grained subcategorisation frames of verbs (Eckle- Kohler and Gurevych, 2012) and (iv) semantic categories of nouns given by WN semantic fields.",
        "We selected POS tags that play an important role in syntactic realisations of verbs, e.g. POS tags for personal pronouns which are potential verb arguments.",
        "In our experiments, we tried different sets of function words and POS tags.",
        "For instance, we found that some function words (e.g., reflexive pronouns) and some POS tags (e.g., those for past participles and comparative adjectives) introduced too much noise in the data and therefore we did not select them for the final vocabulary.",
        "8 In order to create SPs from sense examples, we apply POS tagging and lemmatisation using the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) and named entity tagging using the Stanford Named Entity Recogniser (Klein et al., 2003).",
        "The named entity tags attached by the Named Entity Recogniser are mapped to WN semantic fields.",
        "For the generation of ASPs from sense exam-ples, we used a window size of w = 7, while the generation of LSPs has been performed with w = 5 in order to put a focus on the closely neighbouring lexemes in multiword verb lemmas.",
        "The 8 The vocabulary used for the creation of ASPs is available at http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/data/.",
        "window size was set empirically using the English Lexical Sample task of the Senseval-2 dataset as a development set.",
        "The same set was also used for the development of the linguistically motivated vocabulary for ASPs.",
        "9 From the abstract predicate-argument structure information given in VN, we derived only ASPs.",
        "For this, we employed the subcategorisation frames, as well as the semantic role and selectional preference information from VN, and created ASPs based on manually created mappings between these information types and the controlled vocabulary used for ASPs.",
        "2.3 Step 2: Automated Labelling For the automated labelling of verbs in a corpus, we first derive SPs from each corpus sentence containing a target verb.",
        "SPs are derived from corpus sentences by applying the same procedure as described in Step 1 for the creation of SPs from sense examples, the window size used is w = 7.",
        "To compare two SPs, we propose a similarity metric based on Dice's coefficient which calculates the sum of the weighted number of their common bi-grams, tri-grams, and four-grams.",
        "For-mally, the similarity score sim w ?",
        "[0..1] of two SPs p 1 , p 2 is defined as: (1) sim w (p 1 , p 2 ) = 4 ?",

        "Since this mapping turned out to be rather noisy, we did not use the Senseval-2 data in our evaluations.",

Similarity metrics based on Dice's coefficient have often been used in Lesk-based WSD (Lesk, 1986) to calculate the overlap of two sets (e.g., Baldwin et al. (2010)).",
        "In our case, however, the elements of the two sets are bigrams, trigrams and fourgrams, while in Lesk-based algorithms typically sets of unigrams are compared, thus not accounting for word order.",
        "Table 2 shows the algorithm used for automated labelling of corpus instances in pseudo-code.",
        "The algorithm assumes that for each verb v, the corresponding set of SPs derived from UBY sense examples (UBY-LSP(v) and UBY-ASP(v) in Table 2) has already been computed.",
        "For each corpus sentence containing a target verb v, the corresponding SPs for verb v derived from UBY are scored by the similarity metric in (1).",
        "The SPs with the maximum score that is above a threshold t form the set of most similar senses.",
        "From this set, the algorithm picks one sense randomly as a label.",
        "How often this happens, depends on the value of t: the percentage of randomly selected senses ranges from about 33% for t = 0.14 to about 50% for t = 0.04.",
        "3 Data Web corpora.",
        "For the automated labelling of corpus data with WN senses, we use two very large web corpora: the English ukWaC corpus (Ba- roni et al., 2009) and the article pages extracted from the English Wikipedia using the Java-based Wikipedia API JWPL (Zesch et al., 2008).",
        "Fur-ther, for the evaluation of our method, we use three manually sense annotated data sets.",
        "SemCor.",
        "We use the SemCor 3.0 corpus which is annotated with WN 3.0 senses.",
        "MASC.",
        "MASC is a balanced subset of 500K words of written texts and transcribed speech drawn primarily from the Open American National Corpus (OANC).",
        "10 The texts come from 19 different genres which allows us to test our method on real-life data from multiple sources.",
        "The corpus is annotated with various types of linguistic information, including WN 3.0 sense annotations for instances of selected words.",
        "Therefore, MASC is a lexical sample corpus.",
        "We extracted instances of 16 MASC verbs (11,997 instances) which have been sense annotated.",
        "Most instances are annotated by multiple annotators and, to create a gold standard, we took the sense preferred by the majority of annotators and ignored instances where there were ties.",
        "Senseval-3.",
        "In the test corpus of the Senseval-3 all-words disambiguation task sense annotations are provided for each content word in a chunk of the WSJ corpus (5,000 words of running text).",
        "The third annotated data set for our experiment is formed by extracting all verb instances from this test corpus.",
        "Note that the gold standard annotations in Senseval-3 were made using WN 1.7.1.",
        "In our experiments, we use Rada Mihalcea's conversion of the corpus to WN 3.0.",
        "11 However, we found out that some verb instances were converted to sense labels that do not exist in WN 3.0.",
        "After removing those instances, there were 305 verbs with 592 instances left.",
        "4 Experiments and Evaluation Next, we present the intrinsic and the application-based evaluations of our method.",

        "Quantitative Evaluation.",
        "We calculated the accuracy as the percentage of correctly labelled instances and the instance coverage as the percentage of labelled instances.",
        "The sense coverage is calculated as the percentage of all predicted (not annotated) senses relative to all gold verb senses given in SemCor.",
        "A random sense baseline yields 15% accuracy.",
        "Note that a MFS baseline based on WN would not be meaningful, because the WordNet MFS is based on the frequency distribution of annotated senses in SemCor.",
        "Table 3 shows accuracy and coverage results of the automated labelling algorithm for different values of the threshold t and two combinations of sense links from UBY.",
        "Depending on the threshold t, 2% to 55% of the verb instances in SemCor can automatically be labelled, and the instance coverage goes largely in parallel to the coverage of predicted WN senses.",
        "Accuracy ranges between 32% and 47% and exceeds the random sense baseline by a large margin.",
        "Lowering the threshold increases the coverage of the labelling method, but it also leads to a decrease in accuracy of 9 percentage points (12 for the configuration with VN).",
        "Adding more patterns from VN via the WN?",
        "VN alignment, leads to a decrease in both instance and sense coverage combined with an increase in accuracy.",
        "Since SemCor is a rather small corpus, the increase in instance coverage is not as clear as for large Web corpora such as the ukWaC corpus.",
        "Labelling a 1GB subset of the ukWaC corpus based on patterns derived from the WN?FN?",
        "WKT alignments resulted in 15MB of labelled data, whereas 25MB labelled data could be created from the same subset with the additional patterns from the WN?VN alignment.",
        "Qualitative Analysis.",
        "In Table 4, we show examples of the highest ranking patterns and the corresponding labelled SemCor instances for senses that were correctly and falsely annotated.",
        "The examples in Table 4 show that the similarity metric assigns the highest values to instances where function words (e.g., in, to, who) or POS tags (e.g., PP, VV) from the ASP vocabulary occur in the immediate neighbourhood of the target verb.",
        "Since such functions words play an important role in the ASPs derived from VN, the VN ASPs possibly tend to dominate over the SPs derived from sense examples, which explains the observed decrease in coverage (see Table 3).",
        "The falsely labelled instances turn out to be examples of WN senses where the gold sense is very similar to the automatically attached sense as evident from the synset definition given in the rightmost column.",
        "4.2 Extrinsic Evaluation We extrinsically evaluate our method for automated verb sense labelling by using it for learning a classifier for VSD in a train-test setting.",
        "We use features which have been widely used in supervised WSD systems, in particular features based on dependency parsing.",
        "While this might seem to be in contrast to our labelling algorithm which is based on shallow linguistic preprocessing, it is fully justified by the purpose of our extrinsic eval-uation: The main purpose of the extrinsic evaluation is not to outperform state-of-the-art VSD sys-tems, but to show that, when operating with reasonable features, a classifier trained on the data automatically labelled with our method performs equally well as when this classifier is trained on manually annotated data.",
        "4.2.1 Features The training and test data are parsed with the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) which provides Stanford Dependencies output (De Marneffe et al., 2006) as well as phrase structure trees.",

        "Note that the definition of coverage we use here makes its values the upper bounds for the performance of the classifier.",
        "Senseval-3.",
        "We also generated training data automatically for the 305 Senseval verbs.",
        "However, only 152 of those verbs (442 instances) are found in SemCor.",
        "This means we cannot train the classifier for the remaining Senseval verbs.",
        "The coverage of the SemCor training data for the 152 verbs which can be classified is 96.15% and that of the ALC ?",
        "95.25%.",
        "For all 592 Senseval test in-stances, the coverage of the ALC is 90.38%.",
        "4.2.3 Results and Analysis We trained a separate logistic regression classifier for each test verb in the two datasets using the WEKA data mining software (Hall et al., 2009) with default parameters.",
        "The classifiers were trained with features extracted from (i) the SemCor hand-labelled data and (ii) the ALC.",
        "MASC.",
        "The classifier achieves 50.23% accuracy when SemCor is used and 49% when the ALC is employed.",
        "The difference in the results is not statistically significant at p < 0.05.",
        "The MFS 73 baseline scores at 41.72%.",
        "Senseval-3.",
        "The classifier achieves 43.24% with the ALC.",
        "We assigned the MFS to each of the 143 test verbs not found in SemCor since we cannot train the classifier for those.",
        "The achieved accuracy is 45.2%.",
        "We also measured accuracy in a setup where no MFS back-off strategy was employed for SemCor (152 test verbs with 442 instances).",
        "When trained on SemCor data, the classifier achieves 48.64% accuracy compared to 47.51% for the ALC.",
        "All differences in the results are not statistically significant at p < 0.05.",
        "Fi-nally, the MFS baseline accuracy is significantly lower at 25.34% for all 305 test verbs.",
        "For both test datasets, the overall performance of the classifier when trained on automatically labelled data is very close to the setting in which manually created training data is employed.",
        "We thus conclude that the quality of the data produced by our sense labelling method is sufficient and these data can be directly used for training a statistical VSD classifier.",
        "As a reference, the state-of-the-art supervised VSD system described in Chen and Palmer (2009) achieves 64.8% accuracy on the Senseval-2 fine-grained data.",
        "However, we cannot compare to this result due to the different sense inventory which the Senseval-2 data were annotated with.",
        "4.2.4 Sense Links In order to investigate the effect of LLRs, we performed experiments in which sense examples found in WN only were used.",
        "We also experimented with various combinations of the resources available in UBY to determine the contribution of each of those to our method.",
        "Table 5 shows the results.",
        "The setting which includes only WN has the worst performance, thus clearly showing the benefits of using LLRs.",
        "Next, the inclusion of WKT improves both coverage and accuracy.",
        "We conclude that WKT plays an important role in discovering additional verb senses.",
        "Finally, similarly to the results of the intrinsic evaluation, adding VN to the mix increases slightly the coverage but decreases accuracy.",
        "5 Related Work and Discussion Our work is related to previous research on (i) using a combination of lexical resources for knowledge-based WSD, (ii) using lexical resources for distant supervision, and (iii) the automated acquisition of sense-annotated data.",

        "Knowledge-based WSD.",
        "While the combination of sense-annotated data and wordnets has been described for knowledge-based WSD before (e.g., Navigli and Velardi (2005; Agirre and Soroa (2009) who use graph algorithms), only recently Ponzetto and Navigli (2010) have investigated the impact of the combination of different lexical resources on the performance of WSD.",
        "They aligned WN senses with Wikipedia articles and employed two simple knowledge-based algorithms, i.e., a Lesk-based algorithm and a graph-based algo-rithm, to evaluate the resulting LLR for WSD.",
        "While their evaluation demonstrates that the use of an LLR boosts the performance of knowledege-based WSD, it is restricted to nouns only since Wikipedia provides very few verb senses.",
        "More-over, lexical resources that are rich in lexical-syntactic information such as VN have not been involved.",
        "Miller et al. (2012) employ a Lesk-based algorithm which makes use of a combination of WN and an automatically acquired distributional thesaurus.",
        "Lesk-based algorithms play a central role in knowledge-based WSD.",
        "Based on the overlap of the context of the target word and sense definitions in a given sense inventory, they assign the sense with the highest overlap as disambiguation result.",
        "We were kindly provided with the system described in Miller et al. (2012) and we were able to test its performance on our test sets.",
        "The system achieved only 33.86% and 30.16% accuracy for the MASC and the Senseval-3 verbs, respec-tively, which is far below the results we presented.",
        "This low performance is due to the fact that Lesk-based algorithms do not account for word order.",
        "Such information is important especially for verb senses, as the syntactic behaviour of a verb reflects aspects of its meaning.",
        "Distant supervision.",
        "Distant supervision is a learning paradigm similar to semi-supervised learning.",
        "Unlike semi-supervised methods which typically employ a supervised classifier and a 74 small number of seed instances to do bootstrap learning (Yarowsky, 1995; Mihalcea, 2004; Fujita and Fujino, 2011), in distant supervision training data are created in a single run from scratch by aligning corpus instances with entries in a knowledge base.",
        "Distant supervision methods that have used LLRs as knowledge bases have been previously applied in relation extraction, e.g. Freebase (Mintz et al., 2009; Surdeanu et al., 2012) and BabelNet (Krause et al., 2012; Moro et al., 2013).",
        "However, as far as we are aware, we are the first to apply distant supervision to the task of verb sense disambiguation.",
        "Acquisition of sense-annotated data.",
        "Most previous work on using lexical resources for automatically acquiring sense-annotated data either was mostly restricted to noun senses or, unlike us, did not present a meaningful evaluation.",
        "Leacock et al. (1998) describe the automated creation of training data for supervised WSD on the basis of WN as a lexical resource combined with corpus statistics, but they evaluate their approach just on one noun, verb, and adjective, and thus it is unclear whether their results can be generalized.",
        "Cuadros and Rigau (2008) used the approach of Leacock et al. (1998) to automatically build a large KnowNet from the Web, but they evaluated this resource only for WSD of nouns.",
        "However, the system based on KnowNet yields results below the SemCor-MFS baseline.",
        "Mihalcea and Moldovan (1999) use WordNet glosses to extract sense examples from the Web via a search engine and use this approach in a subsequent paper (Mihalcea, 2002) to generate a sense tagged corpus.",
        "For five randomly selected nouns, they performed a comparative evaluation of a WSD classifier trained on an automatically tagged corpus on the one hand, and on the manually annotated data from the Senseval-2 English lexical sample task on the other hand.",
        "The results obtained for these five nouns seem to be similar but the dataset used is too small to draw meaningful conclusions and moreover, it does not cover verbs.",
        "Mostow and Duan (2011) presented a system that extracts example contexts for nouns and apply these contexts in (Duan and Yates, 2010) for WSD by using them to label text and train a statistical classifier.",
        "An evaluation of this classifier yielded results similar to those obtained by a supervised WSD system.",
        "K?ubler and Zhekova (2009) extract example sentences from several English dictionaries and various types of corpora, including web corpora.",
        "They employ a Lesk-based algorithm to automatically annotate the target word instances in the extracted example sentences with WN senses and use them in one of their experiments as training data for a WSD classifier.",
        "However, the performance of the system decreased significantly achieving the lowest accuracy among all system configurations.",
        "The authors provide only the overall accuracy score, so we do not know how disambiguation of verbs was affected.",
        "Summary.",
        "We consider the ability to establish a link between the rich knowledge available in LLRs and corpora of any kind to be the main advantage of our automated labelling method.",
        "How-ever, to automatically label a suffcient amount of data for supervised learning, very large corpora are required.",
        "Our method can be extended to other POS (using sense examples and possibly other types of lexical information), as well as to other languages where (linked) lexical resources are available.",
        "6 Conclusion In this paper, we presented a novel method for creating sense labelled corpora automatically.",
        "We exploit LLRs and perform large-scale intrinsic and application-based evaluations.",
        "The results of those evaluations show that the quality of the sense labelled corpora created with our method matches that of manually annotated corpora.",
        "In future research, we plan to use PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) in order to extract sense examples for VN as well.",
        "This might improve the performance of lexical resource combinations which include VN.",
        "We will also apply our method to languages (e.g., German) for which lexical resources are available but no or little sense annotated corpora exist.",
