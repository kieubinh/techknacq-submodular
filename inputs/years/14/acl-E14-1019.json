        "Building resources for Computational Linguistics (CL) is of crucial interest.",
        "Most of existing lexical-semantic networks have been built by hand (like for instance WordNet (Miller et al., 1990)) and, despite that tools are generally designed for consistency checking, the task remains time consuming and costly.",
        "Fully automated approaches are generally limited to term co-occurrences as extracting precise semantic relations between terms from corpora remains really difficult.",
        "Meanwhile, crowdsourcing approaches are flowering in CL especially with the advent of Amazon Mechanical Turk or in a broader scope Wikipedia and Wiktionary, to cite the most well-known examples.",
        "WordNet is such a lexical network, constructed by hand at great cost, based on synsets which can be roughly considered as concepts (Fellbaum, 1988).",
        "Eu-roWordnet (Vossen., 1998) a multilingual version of WordNet and WOLF (Sagot., 2008) a French version of WordNet, were built by automated crossing of WordNet and other lexical resources along with some manual checking.",
        "Nav-igli (2010) constructed automatically BabelNet a large multilingual lexical network from term co-occurrences in Wikipedia.",
        "A lexical-semantic network can contain lem-mas, word forms and multi-word expressions as entry points (nodes) along with word meanings and concepts.",
        "The idea itself of word senses in the lexicographic tradition may be debatable in the context of resources for semantic analysis, and we generally prefer to consider word usages.",
        "A given polysemous word, as identified by locutors, has several usages that might differ substantially from word senses as classically defined.",
        "A given usage can also in turn have several deeper refinements and the whole set of usages can take the form of a decision tree.",
        "For example, frigate can be a bird or a ship.",
        "A frigate>boat can be distinguished as a modern ship with missiles and radar or an ancient vessel with sails.",
        "In the context of a collaborative con-struction, such a lexical resource should be considered as being constantly evolving and a general rule of thumb is to have no definite certitude about the state of an entry.",
        "For a polysemic term, some refinements might be just missing at a given time notwithstanding evolution of language which might be very fast, especially in technical domains.",
        "There is no way (unless by inspection) to know if a given entry refinements are fully completed, and even if this question is really relevant.",
        "The building of a collaborative lexical network (or, in all generality, any similar resource) can be devised according to two broad strategies.",
        "First, it can be designed as a contributive system 174 like Wikipedia where people willingly add and complete entries (like for Wiktionary).",
        "Second, contributions can be made indirectly thanks to games (better known as GWAP (vonAhn, 2008)) and in this case players do not need to be aware that while playing they are helping building a lexical resource.",
        "In any case, the built lexical network is not free of errors which are corrected along their discovery.",
        "Thus, a large number of obvious relations are not contained in the lexical network but are indeed necessary for a high quality resources usable in various NLP applications and notably semantic analysis.",
        "For exam-ple, contributors seldom indicate that a particular bird type can fly, as it is considered as an obvious generality.",
        "Only notable facts which are not easily deductible are naturally contributed.",
        "Well known exceptions are also generally contributed and take the form of a negative weight and annotated as such (for example, fly ag ent :?100 ????????",
        "ostrich [exception: bird]).",
        "In order to consolidate the lexical network, we adopt a strategy based on a simple inference mechanism to propose new relations from those already existing.",
        "The approach is strictly endogenous (i.e. self-contained) as it doesn't rely on any other external resources.",
        "Inferred relations are submitted either to contributors for voting or to experts for direct valida-tion/invalidation.",
        "A large percentage of the inferred relations has been found to be correct however, a non-negligible part of them are found to be wrong and understanding why is both interesting and useful.",
        "The explanation process can be viewed as a reconciliation between the inference engine and contributors who are guided through a dialog to explain why they found the considered relation incorrect.",
        "The possible causes for a wrong inferred relation may come from three possible origins: false premises that were used by the inference engine, exception or confusion due to some polysemy.",
        "In (Sajous et al., 2013) an endogenous enrichment of Wiktionary is done thanks to a crowdsourcing tool.",
        "A quite similar approach of using crowdsourcing has been considered by (Ze- ichner, 2012) for evaluating inference rules that are discovered from texts.",
        "In (Krachina, 2006), some specific inference methods are conducted on text with the help of an ontology.",
        "Simi-larly, (Besnard, 2008) capture explanation with ontology-based inference.",
        "OntoLearn (Velardi, 2006) is a system that automatically build ontologies of specific domains from texts and also makes use of inferences.",
        "There have been also researchs on taxonomy induction based on WordNet (Snow, 2006).",
        "Although extensive work on inference from texts or handcrafted resources has been done, almost none endogenously on lexical network built by the crowds.",
        "Most probably the main reason of that situation is the lack of such specific resources.",
        "In this article, we first present the principles behind the lexical network construction with crowdsourcing and games with a purpose (also know as human-based computation games) and illustrated them with the JeuxDeMots (JDM) project.",
        "Then, we present the outline of an elicitation engine based on an inference engine using deduction, induction and especially abduction schemes.",
        "An experimentation is then presented.",
        "2 Crowdsourced Lexical Networks For validating our approach, we used the JDM lexical network, which is constructed thanks to a set of associatory games (Lafourcade, 2007) and has been made freely available by its authors.",
        "There is an increasing trend of using on-line GWAPs (game with a purpose (Thaler et al., 2011)) method for feeding such resources.",
        "Beside manual or automated strategies, contributive approaches are flowering and becoming more and more popular as they are both cheap to set up and efficient in quality.",
        "The network is composed of terms (as ver-tices) and typed relations (as links between vertices) with weight.",
        "It contains terms and possible refinements.",
        "There are more than 50 types of relations, that range from ontological (hypernym, hyponym), to lexical-semantic (synonym, antonym) and to semantic role (agent, patient, instrument).",
        "The weight of a relation is interpreted as a strength, but not directly as a probability of being valid.",
        "The JDM network is not an ontology with some clean hierarchy of concepts or terms.",
        "A given term can have a substantial set of hypernyms that covers a large part of the ontological chain to upper concepts.",
        "For example, hypernym(cat) = {feline,mammal, living being,pet,vertebrate, ...}.",
        "Heavier weights associated to relations are those felt by users as being the most relevant.",
        "The 175 1st January 2014, there are more than 6 700 000 relations and roughly 310 000 lexical items in the JDM lexical network (according to the figures given by the game site: http://jeuxdemots.org).",
        "To our knowledge, there is no other existing freely available crowdsourced lexical-network, especially with weighted relations, thus enabling strongly heuristic methods.",
        "3 Inferring with Deduction & Induction Adding new relations to the JDM lexical network may rely on two components: (a) an inference engine and (b) a reconciliator.",
        "The inference engine proposes relations as a contributor to be validated by other human contributors or experts.",
        "In case of invalidation of an inferred re-lation, the reconciliator is invoked to try to assess why the inferred relation was found wrong.",
        "Elicitation here should be understood as the process to transform some implicit knowledge of the user into explicit relations in the lexical network.",
        "The core ideas about inferences in our engine are the following: ?",
        "inferring is to derive new premises (as relations between terms) from previously known premises, which are existing rela-tions; ?",
        "candidate inferences may be logically blocked on the basis of the presence or the absence of some other relations; ?",
        "candidate inferences can be filtered out on the basis of a strength evaluation.",
        "3.1 Deduction Scheme Inferring by deduction is a top-down scheme based on the transitivity of the relation is-a (hy- pernym).",
        "If a term A is a kind of B and B holds some relation R with C, then we can expect that A holds the same relation type with C. The scheme can be formally written as follows: ?",
        "A i s?a????",
        "B ?",
        "?",
        "B R??",
        "C ?",
        "A R??",
        "C. For example, shark i s?a????",
        "fish and fish has?par t ????????",
        "fin, thus we can expect that shark has?par t ????????",
        "fin.",
        "The inference engine is applied on terms having at least one hypernym (the scheme could not be applied otherwise).",
        "Of course, this scheme is far too naive, especially considering the resource we are dealing with and may produce wrong relations (noise).",
        "In effect, the central term B is possibly polysemous and ways to avoid probably wrong inferences can be done through a logical blocking: if there are two distinct meanings for B that hold respectively the first and the second relation, then most probably the inferred relation R(3) is wrong (see figure 1) and hence should be blocked.",
        "Moreover, if one of the premises is tagged by contributors as true but irrelevant, then the inference is blocked.",
        "B Bi Bj A C ( 1 ) i s a : w 1 (3) R?",
        ": w3 ( 4 ) i s a ( 2 ) R : w 2 ( 5 ) R Figure 1: Triangular inference scheme where the logical blocking based on the polysemy of the central term B which has two distinct meanings Bi and B j is applied.",
        "The two arrows without label are those of word meanings.",
        "It is possible to evaluate a confidence level (on an open scale) for each produced inference, in a way that dubious inferences can be eliminated out through statistical filtering.",
        "The weight w of an inferred relation is the geometric mean of the weight of the premises (relations (1) and (2) in Figure 1).",
        "If the second premise has a negative value, the weight is not a number and the proposal is discarded.",
        "As the geometric mean is less tolerant to small values than the arithmetic mean, inferences which are not based on two rather strong relations (premises) are unlikely to pass.",
        "w(A R??",
        "C) = ( w(A i s?a????",
        "B) ?",
        "w(B R??",
        "C) )1/2 ?",
        "w3 = (w1 ?",
        "w2)1/2 Inducing a transitive closure over a knowledge base is not new, but doing so considering word meanings over a crowdsourced lexical network is an original approach.",
        "3.2 Induction Scheme As for the deductive inference, induction exploits the transitivity of the relation is-a.",
        "If a term A is a kind of B and A holds a relation R with C , then we might expect that B could hold the same type of relation with C .",
        "More formally we can write: ?",
        "A i s?a????",
        "B ?",
        "?",
        "A R??",
        "C ?",
        "B R??",
        "C. For example, shark i s?a????",
        "fish and shark has?par t ??????",
        "jaw, thus we might expect that fish has?par t ??????",
        "jaw.",
        "This scheme is a generalization inference.",
        "The principle is similar to the one applied to the de-176 duction scheme and similarly some logical and statistical filtering may be undertaken.",
        "B C A Ai Aj ( 1 ) i s a : w 1 ( 2 ) R : w 3 ( 5 ) i s a ( 4 ) R ( 3 ) R ?",
        ": w 2 Figure 2: (1) and (2) are the premises, and (3) is the induction proposed for validation.",
        "Term A may be polysemous with meanings holding premises, thus inducing a probably wrong relation.",
        "The central term here A, is possibly polysemous (as shown in Figure 2).",
        "In that case, we have the same polysemy issues than with the de-duction, and the inference may be blocked.",
        "The estimated weight for the induced relation is: w(B R??",
        "C) = (w(A R??",
        "C))2 / w(A i s?a????",
        "B) ?",
        "w2 = (w3)2/w1 3.3 Performing Reconciliation Inferred relations are presented to the validator to decide of their status.",
        "In case of invalida-tion, a reconciliation procedure is launched in order to diagnose the reasons: error in one of the premises (previously existing relations are false), exception or confusion due to polysemy (the inference has been made on a polysemous central term).",
        "A dialog is initiated with the user (Cohen's kappa of 0.79).",
        "To know in which order to pro-ceed, the reconciliator checks if the weights of the premises are rather strong or weak.",
        "Errors in the premises.",
        "We suppose that relation (1) (in Figure 1 and 2) has a relatively low weight.",
        "The reconciliation process asks the validator if the relation (1) is true.",
        "It sets a negative weight to this relation if not so that the engine blocks further inferences.",
        "Else, if relation (1) is true, we ask about relation (2) and proceed as above if the answer is negative.",
        "Otherwise, we check the other cases (exception, polysemy).",
        "Errors due toExceptions.",
        "For the deduction, in case we have two trusted relations, the reconciliation process asks the validators if the inferred relation is a kind of exception relatively to the term B .",
        "If it is the case, the relation is stored in the lexical network with a negative weight and annotated as exception.",
        "Relations that are exceptions do not participate further as premises for deducing.",
        "For the induction, in case we have two trusted relations, the reconciliator asks the validators if the relation (A R??",
        "C) (which served as premise) is an exception relatively to the term B .",
        "If it is the case, in addition to storing the false inferred relation (B R??",
        "C) in the lexical network with a negative weight, the relation (A R??",
        "C) is annotated as exception.",
        "In the induction case, the exception is a true premise which leads to a false induced relation.",
        "In both cases of induction and deduction, the exception tag concerns always the relation (A R??",
        "C).",
        "Once this relation is annotated as an exception, it will not participate as a premise in inferring generalized relations (bottom-up model) but can still be used in inducing specified relations (top-down model).",
        "Errors due to Polysemy.",
        "If the central term (B for deduction and A for induction) presenting a polysemy is mentioned as polysemous in the network, the refinement terms ter m1, ter m2, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "ter mn are presented to the validator so she/he can choose the appropriate one.",
        "The validator can propose new terms as refinements if she/he is not satisfied with the listed ones (in- ducing the creation of new appropriate refine-ments).",
        "If there is no meta information indicating that the term is polysemous, we ask first the validator if it is indeed the case.",
        "After this proce-dure, new relations will be included in the network with positive values and the inference engine will use them later on as premises.",
        "4 Abductive Inference The last inferring scheme is built upon abduction and can be viewed as an example based strategy.",
        "Hence abduction relies on similarity between terms, which may be formalized in our context as sharing some outgoing relations between terms.",
        "The abductive inferring layout supposes that relations held by a term can be proposed to similar terms.",
        "Here, abduction first selects a set of similar terms to the target term A which are considered as proper examples.",
        "The outgoing relations from the examples which are not common with those of A are proposed as potential relations for A and then presented for validation/invalidation to users.",
        "Unlike induction and deduction, abduction can be applied on 177 terms with missing or irrelevant ontological rela-tions, and can generate ontological relations to be used afterward by the inference loop.",
        "4.1 Abduction Scheme We note an outgoing relation as a 3-uple of a type t , a weight w and a target node n:Ri = ?",
        "ti , wi , ni ?.",
        "For example, consider the term A having n outgoing relations.",
        "Amongst these relations, we have for example: ?",

        "A.",
        "We found 3 examples sharing those two relations with the term A: ?",
        "beak has?par t ????",
        "{ex1,ex2,ex3} ?",
        "nest l ocati on????",
        "{ex1,ex2,ex3} We consider these terms as a set of examples to follow and similar to A.",
        "These examples have also other outgoing relations which are proposed as potential relations for A.",

        "4.2 Abduction Filtering Applying the abduction procedure crudely on the terms generates a lot of waste as a considerable amount of erroneous inferred relations.",
        "Hence, we elaborated a filtering strategy to avoid having a lot of dubious proposed candidates.",
        "For this purpose, we define two different threshold pairs.",
        "The first threshold pair (?1, ?1) is used to select proper examples x1,x2...xn and is defined as follows: ?1 =max(3,nbogr(A)?0.1) (1) where nbogr(A) is the number of outgoing relations from the term A.",

        "Correct relations represent around 80% of the relations that have been evaluated (around 5.6% of the total number of produced relations).",
        "One suprising fact, is that the 80% seem to be quite constant notwithstanding the relation type, the lowest value being 77% (for instr-1 which is the relation specifying what can be done with x as an instrument) and the highest being 85% (for action-place which is the relation associating for an action the typical locations where it can occur).",
        "The abduction process is not ontologically based, and hence does not rely on the generic (is-a) or specific (hyponym) relations, but on the contrary on any set of examples that seems to be alike the target term.",
        "The apparent stability of 80% correct abducted relations may be a positive consequence of relying on a set of examples, with a potentially irreductible of 20% wrong abducted relations.",
        "Figure 4 presents two types of data: (1) the percentage of correct abducted relations according to the number of examples required to produce the inference, and (2) the proportion between the produced relations and the total of 107 416 relations according to the minimal number of examples allowed.",
        "What can clearly be seen is that when the number of required examples is increased, the ratio of correct abductions increases accordingly, but the number of proposed relations dramaticaly falls.",
