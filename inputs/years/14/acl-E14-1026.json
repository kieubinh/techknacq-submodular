        "Source-side preordering for translation is the task of rearranging the order of a given source sentence so that it best resembles the order of the target sentence.",
        "It is a divide-and-conquer strategy aiming to decouple long-range word movement from the core translation task.",
        "The main advantage is that translation becomes computationally cheaper as less word movement needs to be con-sidered, which results in faster and better transla-tions, if preordering is done well and efficiently.",
        "Preordering also can facilitate better estimation of alignment and translation models as the parallel data becomes more monotonically-aligned, and ?",
        "This work was done during an internship of the first author at SDL Research, Cambridge.",
        "translation gains can be obtained for various system architectures, e.g. phrase-based, hierarchical phrase-based, etc.",
        "For these reasons, preordering has a clear research and commercial interest, as reflected by the extensive previous work on the subject (see Section 2).",
        "From these approaches, we are particularly interested in those that (i) involve little or no human intervention, (ii) require limited computational resources at runtime, and (iii) make use of available linguistic analysis tools.",
        "In this paper we propose a novel preordering approach based on a logistic regression model trained to predict whether to swap nodes in the source-side dependency tree.",
        "For each pair of sibling nodes in the tree, the model uses a feature-rich representation that includes lexical cues to make relative reordering predictions between them.",
        "Given these predictions, we conduct a depth-first branch-and-bound search through the space of possible permutations of all sibling nodes, using the regression scores to guide the search.",
        "This approach has multiple advantages.",
        "First, the search for permutations is efficient and does not require specific heuristics or hard limits for nodes with many children.",
        "Second, the inclusion of the regression prediction directly into the search allows for finer-grained global decisions as the predictions that the model is more confident about are preferred.",
        "Finally, the use of a single regression model to handle any number of child nodes avoids incurring sparsity issues, while allowing the integration of a vast number of features into the preordering model.",
        "We empirically contrast our proposed method against another preordering approach based on automatically-extracted rules when translating English into Japanese and Korean.",
        "We demonstrate a significant reduction in number of crossing links of more than 10% absolute, as well as translation gains of over 2.2 BLEU points over the baseline.",
        "239 We also show it outperforms a multi-class classification approach and analyse why this is the case.",
        "2 Related work One useful way to organize previous preordering techniques is by how they incorporate linguistic knowledge.",
        "On one end of the spectrum we find those approaches that rely on syntactic parsers and human knowledge, typically encoded via a set of hand-crafted rules for parse tree rewriting or transformation.",
        "Examples of these can be found for French-English (Xia and McCord, 2004), German-English (Collins et al., 2005), Chinese-English (Wang et al., 2007), English-Arabic (Badr et al., 2009), English-Hindi (Ramanathan et al., 2009), English-Korean (Hong et al., 2009), and English-Japanese (Lee et al., 2010; Isozaki et al., 2010).",
        "A generic set of rules for transforming SVO to SOV languages has also been described (Xu et al., 2009).",
        "The main advantage of these approaches is that a relatively small set of good rules can yield significant improvements in translation.",
        "The common criticism they receive is that they are language-specific.",
        "On the other end of the spectrum, there are preordering models that rely neither on human knowledge nor on syntactic analysis, but only on word alignments.",
        "One such approach is to form a cascade of two translation systems, where the first one translates the source to its preordered version (Costa-juss`a and Fonollosa, 2006).",
        "Alterna-tively, one can define models that assign a cost to the relative position of each pair of words in the sentence, and search for the sequence that optimizes the global score as a linear ordering problem (Tromble and Eisner, 2009) or as a travel-ing salesman problem (Visweswariah et al., 2011).",
        "Yet another line of work attempts to automatically induce a parse tree and a preordering model from word alignments (DeNero and Uszkoreit, 2011; Neubig et al., 2012).",
        "These approaches are attractive due to their minimal reliance on linguistic knowledge.",
        "However, their findings reveal that the best performance is obtained when using human-aligned data which is expensive to create.",
        "Somewhere in the middle of the spectrum are works that rely on automatic source-language syntactic parses, but no direct human intervention.",
        "Preordering rules can be automatically extracted from word alignments and constituent trees (Li et al., 2007; Habash, 2007; Visweswariah et al., 2010), dependency trees (Genzel, 2010) or predicate-argument structures (Wu et al., 2011), or simply part-of-speech sequences (Crego and Mari?no, 2006; Rottmann and Vogel, 2007).",
        "Rules are assigned a cost based on Maximum Entropy (Li et al., 2007) or Maximum Likelihood estimation (Visweswariah et al., 2010), or directly on their ability to make the training corpus more monotonic (Genzel, 2010).",
        "The latter performs very well in practice but comes at the cost of a brute-force extraction heuristic that cannot incorporate lexical information.",
        "Recently, other approaches treat ordering the children of a node as a learning to rank (Yang et al., 2012) or discriminative multi-classification task (Lerner and Petrov, 2013).",
        "These are appealing for their use of finer-grained lexical information, but they struggle to adequately handle nodes with multiple children.",
        "Our approach is closely related to this latter work, as we are interested in feature-rich discriminative approaches that automatically learn preordering rules from source-side dependency trees.",
        "Similarly to Yang et al. (2012) we train a large discriminative linear model, but rather than model each child's position in an ordered list of children, we model a more natural pair-wise swap / no-swap preference (like Tromble and Eisner (2009) did at the word level).",
        "We then incorporate this model into a global, efficient branch-and-bound search through the space of permutations.",
        "In this way, we avoid an error-prone cascade of classifiers or any limit on the possible ordering outcomes (Lerner and Petrov, 2013).",
        "3 Preordering using logistic regression and branch-and-bound search Like Genzel (2010), our method starts with dependency parses of source sentences (which we convert to shallow constituent trees; see Figure 1 for an example), and reorders the source text by permuting sibling nodes in the parse tree.",
        "For each non-terminal node, we first apply a logistic regression model which predicts, for each pair of child nodes, the probability that they should be swapped or kept in their original order.",
        "We then apply a depth-first branch-and-bound search to find the global optimal reordering of children.",

        "This usually happens if either A a or A b is empty, and in this case the alignments provide no indication of which order is better.",

        "This approach cannot incorporate lexical features as that would make the brute-force rule extraction algorithm unmanageable.",
        "We also implemented a multi-class classification setup where we directly predict complete permutations of children nodes using multi-class classification (Lerner and Petrov, 2013).",
        "While this is straightforward for small numbers of children, it leads to a very large number of possible permutations for larger sets of children nodes, making classification too difficult.",
        "While Lerner and Petrov (2013) use a cascade of classifiers and impose a hard limit on the possible reordering outcomes to solve this, we follow Genzel's heuristic: rather than looking at the complete set of children, we apply a sliding window of size 3 starting from the left, and make classification/reordering decisions for each window separately.",
        "Since the windows overlap, decisions made for the first window affect the order of nodes in the second window, etc.",
        "We address this by soliciting decisions from the classifier on the fly as we preorder.",

        "We hypothesise that this is due to the sliding window heuristic, which causes a mismatch in train-test conditions: while samples are not independent of each other at test time due to window overlaps, they are considered to be so when training the classifier.",

        "We verified this on our held-out set, by carrying out exhaustive searches.",
        "We found that not preordering nodes with 16 children did not worsen the crossing score.",
