        "In statistical machine translation (SMT), there has been a lot of interest in trying to incorporate information about the provenance of training examples in order to improve translations for specific target domains.",
        "A popular approach are mixture models (Foster and Kuhn, 2007) where each component contains data from a specific genre or domain.",
        "Mixture models can be trained for cross-domain adaption when the target domain is known or for dynamic adaptation when the target domain is inferred from the source text under translation.",
        "More recent domain adaptation methods employ corpus or instance weights to promote relevant training examples (Matsoukas et al., 2009; Foster et al., 2010) or do more radical data selection based on language model perplexity (Axelrod et al., 2011).",
        "In this work, we are interested in the dynamic adaptation case, which is challenging because we cannot tune our model towards any specific domain.",
        "In previous literature, domains have often been loosely defined in terms of corpora, for exam-ple, news texts would be defined as belonging to the news domain, ignoring the specific content of news documents.",
        "It is often assumed that the data within a domain is homogeneous in terms of style and vocabulary, though that is not always true in practice.",
        "The term topic on the other hand can describe the thematic content of a document (e.g. politics, economy, medicine) or a latent cluster in a topic model.",
        "Topic modelling for machine translation aims to find a match between thematic context and topic clusters.",
        "We view topic adaptation as fine-grained domain adaptation with the implicit assumption that there can be multiple distributions over translations within the same data set.",
        "If these distributions overlap, then we expect topic adaptation to help separate them and yield better translations than an unadapted system.",
        "Topics can be of varying granularity and are therefore a flexible means to structure data that is not uniform enough to be modelled in its entirety.",
        "In recent years there have been several attempts to integrating topical information into SMT either by learning better word alignments (Zhao and Xing, 2006), by adapting translation features cross-domain (Su et al., 2012), or by dynamically adapting lexical weights (Eidelman et al., 2012) or adding sparse topic features (Hasler et al., 2012).",
        "We take a new approach to topic adaptation by estimating probabilistic phrase translation features in a completely Bayesian fashion.",
        "The motivation is that automatically identifying topics in the training data can help to select the appropriate translation of a source phrase in the context of a document.",
        "By adapting a system to automatically induced topics we do not have to trust data from a given domain to be uniform.",
        "We also overcome the problem of defining the level of granularity for domain adaptation.",
        "With more and more training data automatically extracted from the web and little knowledge about its content, we believe this is an important area to focus on.",
        "Translation of web sites is already a popular application for MT systems and could be helped by dynamic model adaptation.",
        "We present results on a mixed data set of the TED corpus, parts of the Commoncrawl corpus which contains crawled web data and parts of the News Commentary corpus which contains 328 Figure 1: Phrasal LDA model for inference on training data.",
        "documents about politics and economics.",
        "We believe that the broad range of this data set makes it a suitable testbed for topic adaptation.",
        "We focus on translation model adaptation to learn how words and phrases translate in a given document-context without knowing the origin of the document.",
        "By learning translations over latent topics and combining several topic-adapted features we achieve improvements of more than 1 BLEU point.",
        "2 Bilingual topic models over phrase pairs Our model is based on LDA and infers topics as distributions over phrase pairs instead of over words.",
        "It is specific to machine translation in that the conditional dependencies between source and target phrases are modelled explicitly, and therefore we refer to it as phrasal LDA.",
        "Topic distributions learned on a training corpus are carried over to tuning and test sets by running a modified inference algorithm on the source side text of those sets.",
        "Translation probabilities are adapted separately to each source text under translation which makes this a dynamic topic adaptation approach.",
        "In the following we explain our approach to topic modelling with the objective of estimating better phrase translation probabilities for data sets that exhibit a heterogeneous structure in terms of vocabulary and style.",
        "The advantage from a modelling point of view is that unlike with mixture models, we avoid sparsity problems that would arise if we treated documents or sets of documents as domains and learned separate models for them.",
        "2.1 Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) LDA is a generative model that learns latent topics in a document collection.",
        "In the original formulation, topics are multinomial distributions over words of the vocabulary and each document is assigned a multinomial distribution over topics (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "Our goal is to learn topic-dependent phrase translation probabilities and hence we modify this formulation by replacing words with phrase pairs.",
        "This is straightforward when both source and target phrases are observed but requires a modified inference approach when only source phrases are observed in an unknown test set.",
        "Different from standard LDA and previous uses of LDA for MT, we define a bilingual topic model that learns topic distributions over phrase pairs.",
        "This allows us to model the units of interest in a more principled way, without the need to map per-word or per-sentence topics to phrase pairs.",

        "Our inference algorithm is an implementation of collapsed variational Bayes (CVB), with a first-order Gaussian approximation (Teh et al., 2006).",
        "It has been shown to be more accurate than standard VB and to converge faster than collapsed Gibbs sampling (Teh et al., 2006; Wang and Blunsom, 2013), with little loss in accuracy.",
        "Because we have to do inference over a large number of phrase pairs, CVB is more practical than Gibbs sampling.",
        "2.2 Overview of training strategy Ultimately, we want to learn translation probabilities for all possible phrase pairs that apply to a given test document during decoding.",
        "Therefore, topic modelling operates on phrase pairs as they will be seen during decoding.",
        "Given word-aligned parallel corpora from several domains, we extract lists of per-document phrase pairs produced by the extraction algorithm in the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007) which contain all phrase pairs consistent with the word alignment.",
        "We run CVB on the set of all training documents to learn latent topics without providing information about the domains.",
        "1 Parallel documents are modelled as bags of phrase pairs.",
        "329 Using the trained model, CVB with modified inference is run on all test documents with the set of possible phrase translations that a decoder would load from a phrase table before decoding.",

        "By default, only 20 target phrases per source phrase are loaded from the phrase table, so in order to allow for new phrase pairs to enter the search space and for translation probabilities to be computed more accurately, we allow for up to 200 target phrases per source.",
        "For each source sentence, we consider all possible phrase segmentations and applicable target phrases.",
        "Unlike in training, we do not iterate over all phrase pairs in the list but over blocks of up to 200 target phrases for a given source phrase.",
        "The algorithm stops when all marginal translation probabilities have converged though in practice we stopped earlier to avoid overfitting.",
        "3.3 Phrase translation probabilities After topic inference on the tuning and test data, the forward translation probabilities P(t|s,d) are computed.",
        "This is done separately for every document d because we are interested in the translation probabilities that depend on the inferred topic proportions for a given document.",
        "For every document, we iterate over source positions p d,i and use the current variational posterior to compute P(t i, j |s i ,d) for all possible target phrases by marginalizing over topics: P(t i, j |s i ,d) = ?",

        "If a source phrase occurs multiple times in the same document, the probabilities are averaged over all occurrences.",
        "The inverse translation probabilities can be computed analogously except that in cases where we 330 do not have variational posteriors for a given pair of source and target phrases, an approximation is needed.",
        "We omit the results here since our experiments so far did not indicate improvements with the inverse features included.",

        "We were guided by two constraints in chosing our data set.",
        "1) the data has document boundaries and the content of each document is assumed to be topically related, 2) there is some degree of topical variation within each data set.",
        "In order to compare to domain adaptation approaches, we chose a setup with data from different corpora.",
        "We want to abstract away from adaptation effects that concern tuning of length penalties and language models, so we use a mixed tuning set containing data from all three domains and train one language model on the concatenation of (equally sized) target sides of the training data.",
