        "Online social networks have become a wide spread medium for information dissemination and interaction between millions of users (Huberman et al., 2009; Kwak et al., 2010), turning, at the same time, into a popular subject for interdisciplinary research, involving domains such as Computer Science (Sakaki et al., 2010), Health (Lampos and Cristianini, 2012) and Psychology (Boyd et al., 2010).",
        "Open access along with the property of structured content retrieval for publicly posted data have brought the microblogging platform of Twitter into the spotlight.",
        "Vast quantities of human-generated text from a range of themes, including opinions, news and everyday activities, spread over a social network.",
        "Naturally, issues arise, like user credibility (Castillo et al., 2011) and content attractiveness (Suh et al., 2010), and quite often trustful or appealing information transmitters are identified by an impact assessment.",
        "1 Intuitively, it is expected that user impact cannot be defined by a single attribute, but depends on multiple user actions, such as posting frequency and quality, interaction strategies, and the text or topics of the written communications.",
        "In this paper, we start by predicting user impact as a statistical learning task (regression).",
        "For that purpose, we firstly define an impact score function for Twitter users driven by basic account properties.",
        "Afterwards, from a set of accounts, we measure several publicly available attributes, such as the quantity of posts or interaction figures.",
        "Textual attributes are also modelled either by word frequencies or, more generally, by clusters of related words which quantify a topic-oriented participation.",
        "The main hypothesis being tested is whether textual and non textual attributes encapsulate patterns that affect the impact of an account.",
        "To model this data, we present a method based on nonlinear regression using Gaussian Processes, a Bayesian non-parametric class of methods (Ras- mussen and Williams, 2006), proven more effective in capturing the multimodal user features.",
        "The modelling choice of excluding components that are not under an account's direct control (e.g. received retweets) combined with a significant user impact prediction performance (r = .78) enabled us to investigate further how specific aspects of a user's behaviour relate to impact, by examining the parameters of the inferred model.",
        "Among our findings, we identify relevant features for this task and confirm that consistent activity and broad interaction are deciding impact factors.",
        "Informativeness, estimated by computing a joint user-topic entropy, contributes well to the separation between low and high impact accounts.",
        "Use case scenarios based on combinations of features are also explored, leading to findings such as that engaging about ?serious?",
        "or more ?light?",

        "0).",
        "It is expected that users with high numbers of followers are also popular in the real world, being well-known artists, politi-cians, brands and so on.",
        "However, non popular entities, the majority in the social network, can also gain a great number of followers, by exploiting, for example, a follow-back strategy.",
        "2 Therefore, using solely the number of followers to quantify impact may lead to inaccurate outcomes (Cha et al., 2010).",

        "All term frequencies are normalised with the total number of tweets posted by the user.",
        "Apart from single word frequencies, we are also interested in deriving a more abstract representation for each user.",
        "To achieve this, we learn word clusters from a distinct reference corpus (D2) that could potentially represent specific domains of discussion (or topics).",
        "From a multitude of proposed techniques, we have chosen to apply spectral clustering (Shi and Malik, 2000; Ng et al., 2002), a hard-clustering method appropriate for high-dimensional data and non-convex clusters (von Luxburg, 2007).",
        "Spectral clustering performs graph partitioning on the word-by-word similarity matrix.",
        "In our case, tweet-term similarity is reflected by the Normalised Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI), an information theoretic measure indicating which words co-occur in the same context (Bouma, 2009).",
        "We use the random walk graph Laplacian and only keep the largest component of the resulting graph, eliminating most stop words in the process.",

        "Examples of extracted word clusters are illustrated in Table 4.",
        "Other techniques were also applied, such as online LDA (Hoffman et al., 2010), but we found that the results were not satisfactory, perhaps due to the short message length and the foreign terms co-occuring within a tweet.",
        "After forming the clusters using D2, we compute a topic score (? )",
        "for each user-topic pair in D1, representing a normalised user-word frequency sum per topic.",

        "As a simple baseline, we apply Ridge Regression (RR) (Hoerl and Kennard, 1970), a reguralised version of the ordinary least squares.",
        "Most importantly, we focus on nonlinear methods for the impact score prediction task given the multimodality of the feature space.",
        "Recently, it was shown by Cohn and Specia (2013) that Support Vector Machines for Regression (SVR) (Vap- nik, 1998; Smola and Sch?olkopf, 2004), commonly considered the state-of-the-art for NLP regression tasks, can be outperformed by Gaussian Processes (GPs), a kernelised, probabilistic approach to learning (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006).",
        "Their setting is close to ours, in that they had few (17) features and were also aiming to predict a complex continuous phenomenon (human post-editing time).",
        "The initial stages of our experimental process confirmed that GPs performed better than SVR; thus, 407 we based our modelling around them, including RR for comparison.",
        "In GP regression, for the inputs x ?",

        "However, inference becomes intractable when many training instances (n) are present as the number of computations needed is O(n 3 ) (Qui?nonero- Candela and Rasmussen, 2005).",
        "Since our training samples are tens of thousands, we apply a sparse approximation method (FITC), which bases parameter learning on a few inducing points in the training set (Qui?nonero-Candela and Rasmussen, 2005; Snelson and Ghahramani, 2006).",
        "5.2 Models For predicting user impact on Twitter, we develop three regression models that build on each other.",

        "For example, Cha et al. (2010) compared followers, retweets and @-mentions received as measures of influence.",
        "Bakshy et al. (2011) aggregated all posts by each user, computed an individual-level influence and then tried to predict it by modelling user attributes (# of followers, followees, tweets and date of joining) together with past user influence.",
        "Their method, based on classification and regression trees (Breiman, 1984), achieved a modest performance (r = .34).",
        "Furthermore, Romero et al. (2011) proposed an algorithm for determining user influence and passivity based on information-forwarding ac-tivity, and Luo et al. (2013) exploited user attributes to predict retweet occurrences.",
        "The primary difference with all the works described above is that we aim to predict user impact by exploiting features under the user's direct control.",
        "Hence, our findings can be used as indirect insights for strategies that individual users may follow to increase their impact score.",
        "In addition, we incorporate the actual text posted by the users in the entire modelling process.",
        "8 Conclusions and Future Work We have introduced the task of user impact prediction on the microblogging platform of Twitter based on user-controlled textual and non-textual attributes.",
        "Nonlinear methods, in particular Gaussian Processes, were more suitable than linear approaches for this problem, providing a strong performance (r = .78).",
        "That result motivated the analysis of specific characteristics in the inferred model to further define and understand the elements that affect impact.",
        "In a nutshell, activity, non clique-oriented interactivity and engagement on a diverse set of topics are among the most decisive impact factors.",
        "In future work, we plan to improve various modelling components and gain a deeper understanding of the derived outcomes in collaboration with domain experts.",
        "For more general conclusions, the consideration of different cultures and media sources is essential.",
