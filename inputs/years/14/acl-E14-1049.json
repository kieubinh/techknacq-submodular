        "Abstract",
        "The distributional hypothesis of Harris (1954), according to which the meaning of words is evidenced by the contexts they occur in, has motivated several effective techniques for obtaining vector space semantic representations of words using unannotated text corpora.",
        "This paper argues that lexico-semantic content should additionally be invariant across languages and proposes a simple technique based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for incorporating multilingual evidence into vectors generated monolingually.",
        "We evaluate the resulting word representations on standard lexical semantic evaluation tasks and show that our method produces substantially better semantic representations than monolingual techniques."

        "Data-driven learning of vector-space word embeddings that capture lexico-semantic properties is a technique of central importance in natural language processing.",
        "Using cooccurrence statistics from a large corpus of text (Deerwester et al., 1990; Turney and Pantel, 2010), 1 it is possible to construct high-quality semantic vectors ?",
        "as judged by both correlations with human judgements of semantic relatedness (Turney, 2006; Agirre et al., 2009) and as features for downstream applications (Turian et al., 2010).",
        "The observation that vectors representing cooccurrence tendencies would capture meaning is expected according to the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954), famously articulated by Firth 1 Related approaches use the internal representations from neural network models of word sequences (Collobert and We-ston, 2008) or continuous bags-of-context wordsels (Mikolov et al., 2013a) to arrive at vector representations that likewise capture cooccurence tendencies and meanings.",
        "(1957) as You shall know a word by the company it keeps.",
        "Although there is much evidence in fa-vor of the distributional hypothesis, in this paper we argue for incorporating translational context when constructing vector space semantic models (VSMs).",
        "Simply put: knowing how words translate is a valuable source of lexico-semantic information and should lead to better VSMs.",
        "Parallel corpora have long been recognized as valuable for lexical semantic applications, including identifying word senses (Diab, 2003; Resnik and Yarowsky, 1999) and paraphrase and synonymy relationships (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005).",
        "The latter work (which we build on) shows that if different words or phrases in one language often translate into a single word or phrase type in a second language, this is good evidence that they are synonymous.",
        "To illustrate: the English word forms aeroplane, airplane, and plane are observed to translate into the same Hindi word: vAy\u0000 yAn (vaayuyaan).",
        "Thus, even if we did not know the relationship between the English words, this translation fact is evidence that they all have the same meaning.",
        "How can we exploit information like this when constructing VSMs?",
        "We propose a technique that first constructs independent VSMs in two languages and then projects them onto a common vector space such that translation pairs (as determined by automatic word alignments) should be maximally correlated (?2).",
        "We review latent semantic analysis (LSA), which serves as our monolingual VSM baseline (?3), and a suite of standard evaluation tasks that we use to measure the quality of the embeddings (?4).",
        "We then turn to experiments.",
        "We first show that our technique leads to substantial improvements over monolingual LSA (?5), and then examine how our technique fares with vectors learned using two different neural networks, one that models word sequences and a second that models bags-of-context 462 Figure 1: Cross-lingual word vector projection using CCA.",
        "words.",
        "We observe substantial improvements over the sequential model using multilingual evidence but more mixed results relative to using the bags-of-contexts model (?6).",
        "2 Multilingual Correlation with CCA To gain information from the translation of a given word in other languages the most basic thing to do would be to just append the given word representation with the word representations of its translation in the other language.",
        "This has three draw-backs: first, it increases the number of dimensions in the vector; second, it can pull irrelevant information from the other language that doesn't generalize across languages and finally the given word might be out of vocabulary of the parallel corpus or dictionary.",
        "To counter these problems we use CCA 2 which is a way of measuring the linear relationship between two multidimensional variables.",
        "It finds two projection vectors, one for each variable, that are optimal with respect to correlations.",

        "k is the diagonal matrix containing the top k singular values, U k is the matrix produced by selecting the corresponding columns from U and A represents the new matrix containing word vector representations in the reduced dimensional space.",
        "4 Word Representation Evaluation We evaluate the quality of our word vector representations on a number of tasks that test how well they capture both semantic and syntactic aspects of the representations.",
        "4.1 Word Similarity We evaluate our word representations on four different benchmarks that have been widely used to measure word similarity.",
        "The first one is the WS-353 dataset (Finkelstein et al., 2001) containing 353 pairs of English words that have been assigned similarity ratings by humans.",
        "This data was further divided into two fragments by Agirre et al. (2009) who claimed that similarity (WS-SIM) and relatedness (WS-REL) are two different kinds of relations and should be dealt with separately.",
        "We present results on the whole set and on the individual fragments as well.",
        "The second and third benchmarks are the RG-65 (Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965) and the MC-30 (Miller and Charles, 1991) datasets that contain 65 and 30 pairs of nouns respectively and have been given similarity rankings by humans.",
        "These differ from WS-353 in that it contains only nouns whereas the former contains all kinds of words.",
        "The fourth benchmark is the MTurk-287 (Radinsky et al., 2011) dataset that constitutes of 287 pairs of words and is different from the above two benchmarks in that it has been constructed by crowdsourcing the human similarity ratings using Amazon Mechanical Turk.",
        "We calculate similarity between a given pair of words by the cosine similarity between their corresponding vector representation.",
        "We then report Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (My- ers and Well, 1995) between the rankings produced by our model against the human rankings.",
        "4.2 Semantic Relations (SEM-REL) Mikolov et al. (2013a) present a new semantic relation dataset composed of analogous word pairs.",
        "It contains pairs of tuples of word relations that follow a common semantic relation.",
        "For example, in England : London :: France : Paris, the two given pairs of words follow the country-capital relation.",
        "There are three other such kinds of rela-tions: country-currency, man-woman, city-in-state and overall 8869 such pairs of words 4 .",
        "The task here is to find a word d that best fits the following relationship: a : b :: c : d given a, b and c. We use the vector offset method described 4 107 pairs were out of vocabulary for our vectors and were ignored.",
        "464 in Mikolov et al. (2013a) that computes the vector y = x a ?",
        "x b + x c where, x a ,x b and x c are word vectors of a, b and c respectively and returns the vector x w from the whole vocabulary which has the highest cosine similarity to y: x w = arg max x w x w ?",
        "y |x w | ?",
        "|y| It is worth noting that this is a non-trivial |V |-way classification task where V is the size of the vocabulary.",
        "4.3 Syntactic Relations (SYN-REL) This dataset contains word pairs that are different syntactic forms of a given word and was prepared by Mikolov et al. (2013a).",
        "For exam-ple, in walking and walked, the second word is the past tense of the first word.",
        "There are nine such different kinds of relations: adjective-adverb, opposites, comaparative, superlative, present-participle, nation-nationality, past tense, plural nouns and plural verbs.",
        "Overall there are 10675 such syntactic pairs of word tuples.",
        "The task here again is identifying a word d that best fits the following relationship: a : b :: c : d and we solve it using the method described in ?4.2.",
        "5 Experiments 5.1 Data For English, German and Spanish we used the WMT-2011 5 monolingual news corpora and for French we combined the WMT-2011 and 2012 6 monolingual news corpora so that we have around 300 million tokens for each language to train the word vectors.",
        "For CCA, a one-to-one correspondence between the two sets of vectors is required.",
        "Obvi-ously, the vocabulary of two languages are of different sizes and hence to obtain one-to-one map-ping, for every English word we choose a word from the other language to which it has been aligned the maximum number of times 7 in a parallel corpus.",
        "We got these word alignment counts using cdec (Dyer et al., 2010) from the parallel news commentary corpora (WMT 2006-10) combined with the Europarl corpus for English-{German, French, Spanish}.",
        "5 http://www.statmt.org/wmt11/ 6 http://www.statmt.org/wmt12/ 7 We also tried weighted average of vectors across all aligned words and did not observe any significant difference in results.",
        "5.2 Methodology We construct LSA word vectors of length 640 8 for English, German, French and Spanish.",
        "We project the English word vectors using CCA by pairing them with German, French and Spanish vectors.",

        "We then select the k that gives us the best average performance across language pairs, which is k = 80%, and evaluate the corresponding vectors on all other benchmarks.",
        "This prevents us from over-fitting k for every individual task.",
        "5.3 Results Table 1 shows the Spearman's correlation ratio obtained by using word vectors to compute the similarity between two given words and compare the ranked list against human rankings.",
        "The first row in the table shows the baseline scores obtained by using only the monolingual English vectors whereas the other rows correspond to the multilingual cases.",
        "The last row shows the average performance of the three language pairs.",
        "For all the tasks we get at least an absolute gain of 20 points over the baseline.",
        "These results are highly assuring of our hypothesis that multilingual context can help in improving the semantic similarity between similar words as described in the example in ?1.",
        "Results across language pairs remain almost the same and the differences are most of the times statistically insignificant.",
        "Table 1 also shows the accuracy obtained on predicting different kinds of relations between word pairs.",
        "For the SEM-REL task the average improvement in accuracy is an absolute 30 points over the baseline which is highly statistically significant (p < 0.01) according to the McNemar's test (Dietterich, 1998).",
        "The same holds true for the SYN-REL task where we get an average improvement of absolute 8 points over the baseline across the language pairs.",
        "Such an improvement in scores across these relation prediction tasks further enforces our claim that cross-lingual context can be exploited using the method described in ?2 and it does help in encoding the meaning of a word better in a word vector than monolingual information alone.",

        "7 Related Work Our method of learning multilingual word vectors is most closely associated to Zou et al. (2013) who learn bilingual word embeddings and show their utility in machine translation.",
        "They optimize the monolingual and the bilingual objective together whereas we do it in two separate steps and project to a common vector space to maximize correlation between the two.",
        "Vuli?c and Moens (2013) learn bilingual vector spaces from non parallel data induced using a seed lexicon.",
        "Our method can also be seen as an application of multi-view learning (Chang et al., 2013; Collobert and We-ston, 2008), where one of the views can be used to capture cross-lingual information.",
        "Klementiev et al. (2012) use a multitask learning framework to encourage the word representations learned by neural language models to agree cross-lingually.",
        "CCA can be used for dimension reduction and to draw correspondences between two sets of data.Haghighi et al. (2008) use CCA to draw translation lexicons between words of two different languages using only monolingual corpora.",
        "CCA has also been used for constructing monolingual word representations by correlating word vectors that capture aspects of word meaning and different types of distributional profile of the word (Dhillon et al., 2011).",
        "Although our primary experimental emphasis was on LSA based monolingual word representations, which we later generalized to two different neural network based word embeddings, these monolingual word vectors can also be obtained using other continuous models of language (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Mnih and Hinton, 2008; Morin and Bengio, 2005; Huang et al., 2012).",
        "Bilingual representations have previously been explored with manually designed vector space models (Peirsman and Padó, 2010; Sumita, 2000) and with unsupervised algorithms like LDA and LSA (Boyd-Graber and Blei, 2012; Zhao and Xing, 2006).",
        "Bilingual evidence has also been exploited for word clustering which is yet another form of representation learning, using both spectral methods (Zhao et al., 2005) and structured prediction approaches (T?ackstr?om et al., 2012; Faruqui and Dyer, 2013).",
        "8 Conclusion We have presented a canonical correlation analysis based method for incorporating multilingual context into word representations generated using only monolingual information and shown its applicability across three different ways of generating monolingual vectors on a variety of evaluation benchmarks.",
        "These word representations obtained after using multilingual evidence perform significantly better on the evaluation tasks compared to the monolingual vectors.",
        "We have also shown that our method is more suitable for vectors that encode semantic information than those that encode syntactic information.",
        "Our work suggests that multilingual evidence is an important resource even for purely monolingual, semantically aware applications.",
