        "Topic modelling based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA: Blei et al. (2003)) and related methods is increasingly being used in user-focused tasks, in contexts such as the evaluation of scientific impact (McCallum et al., 2006; Hall et al., 2008), trend analysis (Bolelli et al., 2009; Lau et al., 2012a) and document search (Wang et al., 2007).",
        "The LDA model is based on the assumption that document collections have latent topics, in the form of a multinomial distribution of words, which is typically presented to users via its top-N highest-probability words.",
        "In NLP, topic models are generally used as a means of preprocessing a document collection, and the topics and per-document topic allocations are fed into downstream applications such as document summarisation (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009), novel word sense detection methods (Lau et al., 2012b) and machine translation (Zhao and Xing, 2007).",
        "In fields such as the digital humanities, on the other hand, human users interact directly with the output of topic models.",
        "It is this context of topic modelling for direct human consumption that we target in this paper.",
        "The topics produced by topic models have a varying degree of human-interpretability.",
        "To illustrate this, we present two topics automatically learnt from a collection of news articles: 1.",
        "?farmers, farm, food, rice, agriculture?",
        "2.",
        "?stories, undated, receive, scheduled, clients?",
        "The first topic is clearly related to agriculture.",
        "The subject of the second topic, however, is less clear, and may confuse users if presented to them as part of a larger topic model.",
        "Measuring the human-interpretability of topics and the overall topic model is the core topic of this paper.",
        "Various methodologies have been proposed for measuring the semantic interpretability of topics.",
        "In Chang et al. (2009), the authors proposed an indirect approach based on word intrusion, where ?intruder words?",
        "are randomly injected into topics and human users are asked to identify the intruder words.",
        "The word intrusion task builds on the assumption that the intruder words are more identifiable in coherent topics than in incoherent top-ics, and thus the interpretability of a topic can be estimated by measuring how readily the intruder words can be manually identified by annotators.",
        "Since its inception, the method of Chang et al. (2009) has been used variously as a means of assessing topic models (Paul and Girju, 2010; Reisinger et al., 2010; Hall et al., 2012).",
        "Despite its wide acceptance, the method relies on manual annotation and has never been automated.",
        "This is one of the primary contributions of this work: the demonstration that we can automate the method of Chang et al. (2009) at near-human levels of accu-racy, as a result of which we can perform automatic evaluation of the human-interpretability of topics, as well as topic models.",
        "There has been prior work to directly estimate the human-interpretability of topics through automatic means.",
        "For example, Newman et al. 530 (2010) introduced the notion of topic ?coher- ence?, and proposed an automatic method for estimating topic coherence based on pairwise pointwise mutual information (PMI) between the topic words.",
        "Mimno et al. (2011) similarly introduced a methodology for computing coherence, replacing PMI with log conditional probability.",
        "Musat et al. (2011) incorporated the WordNet hierarchy to capture the relevance of topics, and in Aletras and Stevenson (2013a), the authors proposed the use of distributional similarity for computing the pairwise association of the topic words.",
        "One application of these methods has been to remove incoherent topics before generating labels for topics (Lau et al., 2011; Aletras and Stevenson, 2013b).",
        "Ultimately, all these methodologies, and also the word intrusion approach, attempt to assess the same quality: the human-interpretability of topics.",
        "The relationship between these methodolo-gies, however, is poorly understood, and there is no consensus on what is the best approach for computing the semantic interpretability of topic models.",
        "This is a second contribution of this pa-per: we perform a systematic empirical comparison of the different methods and find appreciable differences between them.",
        "We further go on to propose an improved formulation of Newman et al. (2010) based on normalised PMI.",
        "Finally, we release a toolkit which implements the topic interpretability measures described in this paper.",
        "2 Related Work Chang et al. (2009) challenged the conventional wisdom that held-out likelihood ?",
        "often computed as the perplexity of test data or unseen documents ?",
        "is the only way to evaluate topic models.",
        "To measure the human-interpretability of top-ics, the authors proposed a word intrusion task and conducted experiments using three topic mod-els: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA: Blei et al. (2003)), Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (PLSI: Hofmann (1999)) and the Correlated Topic Model (CTM: Blei and Lafferty (2005)).",
        "Contrary to expectation, they found that perplexity correlates negatively with topic interpretability.",
        "In the word intrusion task, each topic is presented as a list of six words ?",
        "the five most probable topic words and a randomly-selected ?intruder word?, which has low probability in the topic of interest, but high probability in other topics ?",
        "and human users are asked to identify the intruder word that does not belong to the topic in question.",
        "Newman et al. (2010) capture topic interpretability using a more direct approach, by asking human users to rate topics (represented by their top-10 topic words) on a 3-point scale based on how coherent the topic words are (i.e. their observed coherence).",
        "They proposed several ways of automating the estimation of the observed coher-ence, and ultimately found that a simple method based on PMI term co-occurrence within a sliding context window over English Wikipedia produces the consistently best result, nearing levels of inter-annotator agreement over topics learnt from two distinct document collections.",
        "Mimno et al. (2011) proposed a closely-related method for evaluating semantic coherence, replacing PMI with log conditional probability.",
        "Rather than using Wikipedia for sampling the word co-occurrence counts, Mimno et al. (2011) used the topic-modelled documents, and found that their measure correlates well with human judgements of observed coherence (where topics were rated in the same manner as Newman et al. (2010), based on a 3-point ordinal scale).",
        "To incorporate the evaluation of semantic coherence into the topic model, the authors proposed to record words that co-occur together frequently, and update the counts of all associated words before and after the sampling of a new topic assignment in the Gibbs sampler.",
        "This variant of topic model was shown to produce more coherent topics than LDA based on the log conditional probability coherence measure.",
        "Aletras and Stevenson (2013a) introduced distributional semantic similarity methods for computing coherence, calculating the distributional similarity between semantic vectors for the top-N topic words using a range of distributional similarity measures such as cosine similarity and the Dice coefficient.",
        "To construct the semantic vector space for the topic words, they used English Wikipedia as the reference corpus, and collected words that co-occur in a window of ?5 words.",
        "They showed that their method correlates well with the observed coherence rated by human judges.",
        "3 Dataset As one of the primary foci of this paper is the automation of the intruder word task of Chang et al. (2009), our primary dataset is that used in the original paper by Chang et al. (2009), which provides topics and human annotations for a range of 531 domains and topic model types.",
        "In the dataset, two text collections were used: (1) 10,000 articles from English Wikipedia (WIKI); and (2) 8,447 articles from the New York Times dating from 1987 to 2007 (NEWS).",
        "For each document collection, topics were generated by three topic modelling meth-ods: LDA, PLSI and CTM (see Section 2).",
        "For each topic model, three settings of T (the number of topics) were used: T = 50, T = 100 and T = 150.",
        "In total, there were 9 topic models (3 models ?",
        "3 T ) and 900 topics (3 models ?",
        "(50 + 100 + 150)) for each dataset.",
        "1 For some of topic interpretability estimation methods, we require a reference corpus to sample lexical probabilities.",
        "We use two reference corpora: (1) NEWS-FULL, which contains 1.2 million New York Times articles from 1994 to 2004 (from the English Gigaword); and (2) WIKI-FULL, which contains 3.3 million English Wikipedia articles (retrieved November 28th 2009).",
        "2 The rationale for choosing the New York Times and English Wikipedia as the reference corpora is to ensure domain consistency with the word intrusion dataset; the full collections are used to more robustly estimate lexical probabilities.",
        "4 Human-Interpretability at the Model Level In this section, we evaluate measures for estimating human-interpretability at the model level.",
        "That is, for a measure ?",

        "We removed these topics, reducing the total number of topics to 876.",

        "task is that it requires human annotations, therefore preventing large-scale evaluation.",
        "We begin by proposing a methodology to fully automate the word intrusion task.",
        "Lau et al. (2010) proposed a methodology that learns the most representative or best topic word that summarises the semantics of the topic.",
        "Observing that the word intrusion task ?",
        "the task of detecting the least representative word ?",
        "is the converse of the best topic word selection task, we adapt their methodology to automatically identify the intruder word for the word intrusion task, based on the knowledge that there is a unique intruder word per topic.",
        "The methodology works as follows: given a set of topics (including intruder words), we compute the word association features for each of the top-N topic words of a topic, 3 and combine the features in a ranking support vector regression model (SVM rank : Joachims (2006)) to learn the intruder words.",
        "Following Lau et al. (2010), we use three word association measures: PMI(w i ) = N?1 ?",

        "Observed Coherence In this section, we bring together the indirect approach of word intrusion and the direct approach of observed coherence, and evaluate them against each other at the topic level.",
        "Results are summarised in Table 6.",
        "We see that the correlation between the human ratings of intruder words and observed coherence is only modest, implying that there are topic-level differences in the output of the two approaches.",
        "In Section 6, we provide a qualitative analysis and explanation as to what constitutes the differences between the approaches.",
        "For the automated methods, OC-Auto-DS has the best performance, with OC-Auto-NPMI performing relatively well (in particularly in the NEWS domain).",
        "6 Discussion Normalised PMI (NPMI) was first introduced by Bouma (2009) as a means of reducing the bias for PMI towards words of lower frequency, in addition to providing a standardised range of [?1, 1] for the calculated values.",
        "We introduced NPMI to the automated methods of word intrusion (WI-Auto-NPMI) and observed coherence (OC-Auto-NPMI) to explore its suitability for the task.",
        "For the latter, we saw that NPMI achieves markedly higher correlation than OC-Human (in particular, at the model level).",
        "To better understand the impact of normalisation, we inspected a list of WIKI topics that have similar scores for OC-Human and OC-Auto-NPMI but very different OC-Auto-PMI scores.",
        "A sample of these topics is presented in Table 7.",
        "WIKI-FULL is used as the reference corpus for computing the scores.",
        "Note that the presented OC-Auto-NPMI* and OC-Auto-PMI* scores are post-normalised to the range [0, 1] for ease of interpretation.",
        "To give a sense of how readily these topic words occur in the reference corpus, we additionally display the frequency of the first topic word in the reference corpus (last column).",
        "All topics presented have an OC-Human score of 3.0 (i.e. these topics are rated as being very coherent by human judges) and similar OC-Auto-NPMI values.",
        "Their OC-Auto-PMI scores, how-ever, are very different between the top-3 and bottom-3 topics.",
        "The bias of PMI towards lower frequency words is clear: topic words that occur frequently in the corpus receive a lower OC-Auto-PMI score compared to those that occur less fre-quently, even though the human-judged observed coherence is the same.",
        "OC-Auto-NPMI on the other hand, correctly estimates the coherence.",
        "We observed, however, that the impact of normalising PMI is less in the word intrusion task.",
        "One possible explanation is that for the automated methods WI-Auto-PMI and WI-Auto-NPMI, the PMI/NPMI scores are used indirectly as a feature to a machine learning framework, and the bias could be reduced/compensated by other features.",

        "In general, there are two reasons for topics to have high OC-Human and low WI-Human scores.",
        "First, if a topic has an outlier word that is mildly related to the topic, users tend to choose this word as the intruder word in the word intrusion task, yielding a low WI-Human score.",
        "If they are asked to rate the observed coherence, however, the single outlier word often does not affect its overall coher-ence, resulting in a high OC-Human score.",
        "This is observed in topics 1 and 2 in Table 8, where loch and clown are chosen by annotators in the word intrusion task, as they detract from the semantics of the topic.",
        "This results in low WI-Human scores, but high observed coherence scores (OC-Human).",
        "The second reason is the random selection of intruder words related to the original topic.",
        "We see this in topics 3 and 4, where related intruder words (village and singer) were selected.",
        "For topics with low OC-Human and high WI-Human scores, the true intruder words are often very different to the domain/focus of other topic words.",
        "As such, annotators are consistently able to single them out to yield high WI-Human scores, even though the topic as a whole is not coherent.",
        "Topics 5 and 6 in Table 8 exhibit this.",

        "We looked first at the word intrusion task proposed by Chang et al. (2009), and proposed a method that fully automates the task.",
        "Next we turned to observed coherence, a more direct approach to estimate topic interpretability.",
        "At the model level, results were very positive for both the word intrusion and observed coherence methods.",
        "At the topic level, however, the results were more mixed.",
        "For observed coherence, our best methods (OC-Auto-NPMI and OC-Auto-DS) were able to emulate human performance.",
        "For word intrusion, the automated methods were slightly below human performance, with some room for improvement.",
        "We finally observed that there are systematic differences in the topic-level scores derived from the two task formulations.",
