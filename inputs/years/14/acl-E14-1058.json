        "The newly intensive use of machine learning techniques as well as the need of evaluation data has led Natural Language Processing (NLP) to develop large annotated corpora.",
        "The interest for such enriched language resources has reached domains (semantics, pragmatics, affective com-puting) where the annotation process is highly affected by the coders subjectivity.",
        "The reliability of the resulting annotations must be trusted by measures that assess the inter-coders agreement.",
        "While medecine, psychology, and more generally content analysis, have considered for years the issue of data reliability, NLP has only investigated this question from the mid 1990s.",
        "The influential work of Carletta (1996) has led the ?",
        "statistic (Cohen, 1960) to become the prevailing standard for measuring the reliability of corpus annotation.",
        "Many studies have however questioned the limitations of the ?",
        "statistic and have proposed alternative measures of reliability.",
        "Krippendorff claims that ?popularity of ?",
        "not-withstanding, Cohen's ?",
        "is simply unsuitable as a measure of the reliability of data?",
        "in a paper presenting his ?",
        "coefficient (Krippendorff, 2008).",
        "Except for some rare but noticeable studies (Arstein and Poesio, 2005), most of these critical works restrict to theoretical issues about chance agreement estimation or limitations due to various statistical biases (Arstein and Poesio, 2008).",
        "On the opposite, this paper investigates experimentally these questions on three different tasks: emotion, opinion and coreference annotation.",
        "Four measures of reliability will be considered: Cohen's ?",
        "(Cohen, 1960), Scott's pi (Scott, 1955) and two measures of Krippendorff's ?",
        "(Krippen- dorff, 2004) with different distance.",
        "Section 2 gives a comprehensive presentation of these metrics.",
        "Section 3 details the potential methodological biases that should affect the reliability estimation.",
        "In section 4, we explain the methodology we followed for this study.",
        "Lastly, experimental results are presented in section 5.",
        "2 Reliability measures Any reliability measure considers the most pertinent criterion to estimate data reliability to be reproducibility.",
        "Reproducibility can be estimated by observing the agreement among independent annotators (Krippendorff, 2004): the more the coders agree on the data they have produced, the more their annotations are likely to be reproduced by any other set of coders.",
        "Pure observed agreement is not considered as a good estimator since it does not give any account to the amount of chance that yields to this agreement.",
        "For instance, a restricted number of coding categories should favor chance agreement.",
        "What must be estimated is the proportion of observed agreement beyond the one that is expected by chance: (1) Measure = e eo A AA ?",
        "?",
        "1 550 where Ao is the observed agreement between coders and Ae is an estimation of the possible chance agreement.",
        "Reliability metrics differ by the way they estimate this chance agreement.",
        "Cohen's ?",
        "(Cohen, 1960) defines chance as the statistical independence of the use of coding categories by the annotators.",
        "It postulates that chance annotation is governed by prior distributions that are specific to each coder (annotator bias).",
        "?",
        "was originally developed for two coders and nominal data.",
        "(Davies and Fleiss, 1982) has proposed a generalization to any number of cod-ers, while (Cohen, 1968) has defined a weighted version of the ?",
        "measure that fulfils better the need of reliability estimation for ordinal annota-tions: the disagreement between two ordinal annotations is no more binary, but depends on a Euclidian distance.",
        "This weighted generalization restricts however to a two coders scheme (Art- stein and Poesio, 2008): a weighted version of the multi-coders ?",
        "statistics is still missing.",
        "Unlike Cohen's ?, Scott's pi (Scott, 1955) does not aim at modelling annotator bias.",
        "It defines chance as the statistical independence of the data and the set of coding categories, independently from the coders.",
        "It considers therefore the annotation process and not the behaviour of the annotators.",
        "Scott's original proposal concerned only two coders.",
        "(Fleiss 1971) gave a generalisation of the statistics to any number of coders through a measure of pairwise agreement.",
        "Krippendorff's ?",
        "(Krippendorff, 2004) considers chance independently from coders like Scott's pi, but data reliability is estimated depending on disagreement instead of agreement: (2) Alpha = e oe D DD ?",
        "where Do is the observed disagreement between coders and De is an estimation of the possible chance disagreement.",
        "Another original aspect of this metrics is to allow disagreement estimation between two categories through any distance measure.",
        "This implies that ?",
        "handles directly any number of coders and any kind of annotation (nominal or ordinal coding scheme).",
        "In this paper, we will consider the ?",
        "statistics with a binary as well as a Euclidian distance, in order to assess separately the influence of the distance measure and the metrics by itself.",
        "3 Quality criteria for reliability metrics There is an abundant literature about the criteria of quality a reliability measure should satisfy (Hayes, 2007).",
        "These works emphasize on two important points: ?",
        "A trustworthy measure should provide stable results: measures must be reasonably independent of any factor of influence.",
        "?",
        "The magnitude of the measure must be interpreted in terms of absolute level of reli-ability: the statistics must come up with trustworthy reliability thresholds.",
        "These questions have mainly been investigated from a theoretical point of view.",
        "This section summarizes the main conclusions that should be drawn from these critical studies.",
        "3.1 Annotator bias and number of coders Annotator bias refers to the influence of the idiosyncratic behavior of the coders.",
        "It can be estimated by a bias index which measures the extent to which the distribution of categories differs from one coder's annotation to another (Sim and Wright, 2005).",
        "Annotator bias has an influence on the magnitude of the reliability measures (Feinstein and Cicchetti,1990).",
        "Besides, it concerns the invariance of the measures to the permutation or selection of annotators but also to the number of coders.",
        "A review of the literature shows that theoretical studies on annotator bias are not convergent.",
        "In particular, opposite arguments have been proposed concerning Cohen's ?",
        "(Di Eugenio and Glass 2004, Arstein and Poesio 2008, Hayes, 2007).",
        "This is why we have carried on experiments that investigate: ?",
        "to what extent measures depend on the selection of a specific set of coders (?",
        "5.3), ?",
        "to what extent the stability of the measures depends on the number of coders (?",
        "5.4).",
        "Arstein and Poesio (2005) have shown that the greater the number of coders is, the lower the annotator bias decreases.",
        "Our aim is to go further this conclusion: we will study whether one measure needs fewer coders than another one to converge towards an acceptable annotator bias.",
        "3.2 Category prevalence Prevalence refers to the influence on reliability estimation of a coding category under which a disproportionate amount of annotated data falls.",
        "It can be estimated by a prevalence index which measures the frequency differences of categories on cases where the coders agree (Sim and Wright, 2005).",
        "When the prevalence index is 551 high, chance-corrected measures are spuriously reduced since chance agreement is higher in this situation (Brennan and Sliman, 1992; Di Eugenio and Glass, 2004).",
        "This yields some authors to propose corrected coefficients like the PABAK measure (Byrt and al., 1993), which is a prevalence adjusted and annotator bias adjusted version of Cohen's ?.",
        "The influence of prevalence will not be investigated here, since no category is significantly prevalent in our data.",
        "3.3 Number of coding categories The number of coding categories has an influence on the reliability measures magnitude: the larger the number of categories is, the less the coders have a chance to agree.",
        "Even if this decrease should concern chance agreement too, lower reliability estimations are observed with high numbers of categories (Brenner and Kliebsch, 1996).",
        "This paper investigates this influence by comparing reliability values obtained with a 3-categories and a 5-categories coding scheme applied on the same data (see ?",
        "5.1).",
        "3.4 Interpreting the magnitude of measures in terms of effective reliability One last question concerns the interpretation of the reliability measures magnitude.",
        "It has been particularly investigated with Cohen's ?.",
        "Carletta (1996) advocates 0.8 to be a threshold of good reliability, while a value between 0.67 and 0.8 is considered sufficient to allow tentative conclusion to be drawn.",
        "On the opposite, Krippendorff (2004b) claims that this 0.67 cutoff is a pretty low standard while Neuendorf (2002) supports an even more restrictive interpretation.",
        "Thus, the definition of relevant levels of reliability remains an open problem.",
        "We will see how our experiments should draw a methodological framework to answer this crucial issue.",
        "4 Experiments: methodology 4.1 Introduction We have conducted experiments on three different annotation tasks in order to guarantee an appreciable generality of our findings.",
        "The first two experiments correspond to an ordinal annotation.",
        "They concern the affective dimension of language (emotion and opinion annotation).",
        "They have been conducted with naive coders to preserve the spontaneity of judgment which is searched for in affective computing.",
        "The third experiment concerns coreference annotation.",
        "It is a nominal annotation that has been designed to be used as a comparison with the previous ordinal annotations tasks.",
        "The corresponding annotated corpora are available (TestAccord database) on the french Parole_Publique1 corpus repository under a CC-BY-SA Creative Commons licence.",
        "4.2 Emotion corpus Emotion annotation consists in adding emotional information to written messages or speech transcripts.",
        "There is no real consensus about how an emotion has to be described in an annotation scheme.",
        "Two main approaches can be found in the literature.",
        "On the one hand, emotions are coded by affective modalities (Scherer, 2005), among which sadness, disgust, enjoyment, fear, surprise and anger are the most usual (Ekman, 1999; Cowie and Cornelius, 2003).",
        "On the other hand, an ordinal classification in a multidimensional space is considered.",
        "Several dimensions have been proposed among which three are prevailing (Russell, 1980): valence, intensity and activation.",
        "Activation distinguishes passive from active emotional states.",
        "Valence describes whether the emotional state conveyed by the text is positive, negative or neutral.",
        "Lastly, intensity describes the level of emotion conveyed.",
        "Whatever the approach, low to moderate inter-annotator agreements are observed, what explains that reference annotation must be achieved through a majority vote with a significant number of coders (Schuller and al. 2009).",
        "Inter-coder agreement is particularly low when emotions are coded into modalities (Devillers and al., 2005; Callejas and Lopez-Cozar, 2008).",
        "This is why this study focuses on an ordinal annotation.",
        "Our works on emotion detection (Le Tallec and al., 2011) deal with a specific context: affective robotics.",
        "We consider an affective multimo-dal interaction between hospitalized children and a companion robot.",
        "Consequently, this experiment will concern a child-dedicated corpus.",
        "Although many works already focused on child language (MacWhinney, 2000), no emotional child corpus is currently available in French, our studied language.",
        "We have decided to create a little corpus (230 sentences) of fairy tales, which are regularly used in works related to child affect analysis (Alm and al., 2005; Volkova and al., 2010).",
        "The selected texts come from modern fairy tales (Vassallo, 2004; Vanderheyden, 1995) which present the interest of being quite confidential.",
        "This guarantees that the coders discover 1 www.info.univ-tours.fr/~antoine/parole_publique 552 the text during the annotation.",
        "We asked 25 subjects to characterize the emotional value conveyed by every sentence through a 5-items scale of values, ranging from very negative to very positive.",
        "As shown on Table 1, this affective scale encompasses valence and intensity dimensions.",
        "It enables to compare without methodological bias an annotation with 3 coding categories (valence: negative, positive, neutral) and the original 5- categories (valence+intensity) annotation.",
        "A preliminary experiment showed us that children meet difficulties to handle a 5-values emotional scale.",
        "This is why the annotation was conducted on the fairy tales corpus with adults (11 men/14 women; average age: 31.6 years).",
        "All the coders have a superior level of education (at least, high-school diploma), they did not know each other and worked separately during the annotation task.",
        "Only four of them had a prior experience in corpus annotation.",
        "Value Meaning Valence / Polarity Intensity / Strength -2 very negative negative strong -1 moderately negative negative moderate 0 no emotion neutral none 1 moderately positive positive moderate 2 very positive positive strong Table 1. emotion or opinion annotation schemes The coders were not trained but were given precise annotation guidelines providing some explanations and examples on the emotional values they had to use.",
        "They achieved the annotation once, without any restriction on time.",
        "They had to rely on their own judgment, without considering any additional information.",
        "Sentences were given in a random order to investigate an out-of-context perception of emotion.",
        "We conducted a second experiment where the order of the sentences followed the original fairy tale, in order to study the influence of the discourse context.",
        "The criterion of data significance ?",
        "at least five chance agreements per category ?",
        "proposed by (Krippendorff, 2004) is greatly satisfied for the valence annotation (3 categories).",
        "It is approached on the complete annotation where we can assure 4 chance agreements per category.",
        "4.3 Opinion corpus The second experiment concerns opinion annotation.",
        "Emotion detection can be related to a certain extent, with opinion mining (or sentiment analysis), whose aim is to detect the attitude of people in the texts they produce.",
        "A basic task in opinion mining consists in classifying the polarity of a given text, which should be either a sentence (Wilson and al., 2005), a speech turn or a complete document (Turney, 2002).",
        "Polarity plays the same role as valence does for affect analysis: it describes whether the expressed judgment is positive, negative, or neutral.",
        "One should also characterize the sentiment strength (Thelwall and al., 2010).",
        "This feature can be related to the notion of intensity used in emotional annotation.",
        "Both polarity and sentiment strength are considered in our annotation task.",
        "This experiment has been carried out on a corpus of film reviews.",
        "The reviews were relatively short texts written by ordinary people on dedicated French websites (www.senscritique.com and www.allocine.fr).",
        "They concerned the same French movie.",
        "The corpus contains 183 sentences.",
        "Its annotation was conducted by the 25 previous subjects.",
        "The methodology is identical to the emotion annotation task.",
        "The subjects were asked to qualify the opinion that was conveyed by every sentence of the reviews by means of the same scale of values (Table 1).",
        "This scale encompasses this time the polarity and sentiment strength dimensions.",
        "Once again, the sentences were given in a random order and contextual order respectively.",
        "The criterion of data significance is satisfied here too.",
        "On both annotations, experiments with the random or the contextual order give similar results.",
        "Results from the contextual annotation will be given only when necessary.",
        "4.4 Coreference corpus The last experiment concerns coreference annotation.",
        "We have developed an annotated corpus (ANCOR) which clusters various types of spontaneous and conversational speech.",
        "With a total of 488,000 lexical units, it is one of the largest coreference corpora dedicated to spoken language (Muzerelle and al. 2014).",
        "Its annotation was split into three successive phases: ?",
        "Entity mentions marking, ?",
        "Referential relations marking, ?",
        "Referential relations characterization The experiment described in this paper concerns the characterization of the referential relations.",
        "This nominal annotation consists in classifying relations among five different types: 553 ?",
        "Direct coreference (DIR) ?",
        "Coreferent mentions are NPs with same lexical heads.",
        "?",
        "Indirect coreference (IND) ?",
        "These mentions are NPs with distinct lexical heads.",
        "?",
        "Pronominal anaphora (PRO) ?",
        "The subsequent coreferent mention is a pronoun.",
        "?",
        "Bridging anaphora (BRI) ?",
        "The subsequent mention does not refer to its antecedent but depends on it for its referential interpretation (example: meronymy).",
        "?",
        "Bridging pronominal anaphora (BPA) ?",
        "Bridging anaphora where the subsequent mention is a pronoun.",
        "This type emphasizes metonymies (example: Avoid Central Hostel?",
        "they are unpleasant) The subjects (3 men / 6 women) were adult people (average age: 41.2 years) with a high proficiency in linguistics (researchers in NLP or corpus linguistics).",
        "They know each other but worked separately during the annotation, without any restriction on time.",
        "They are considered as experts since they participated to the definition of the annotation guide.",
        "The study was conducted on an extract of 10 dialogues, representing 384 relations.",
        "Krippendorff's (2004) criterion of significance is therefore satisfied here too.",
        "4.5 Reliability measures The experiments have been conducted with four chance-balanced reliability measures2 : ?",

        "For instance we observed a relative standard deviation of ?c measures higher than 22% when measuring the influence of coders set permuation (?",

        "For instance {-2,-1} negative values are clustered in the same category which receive the index 1.",

        "Satisfactory measures are found on the contrary on the coreference task (0.69 with every metric).",

        "A similar observation was made by (Arstein and Poesio, 2005) with 18 coders.",
