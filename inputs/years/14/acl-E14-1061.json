        "Productive processes like compounding or inflection are problematic for traditional phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) approaches, because words can only be translated as they have occurred in the parallel training data.",
        "As parallel training data is limited, it is desirable to extract as much information from it as possible.",
        "We present an approach for compound processing in SMT, translating from English to German, that splits compounds prior to training (in order to access the individual words which together form the compound) and recombines them after translation.",
        "While compound splitting is a well-studied task, compound merging has not received as much attention in the past.",
        "We start from Stymne and Cancedda (2011), who used sequence models to predict compound merging and Fraser et al. (2012) who, in addition, generalise over German inflection.",
        "Our new contributions are: (i) We project features from the source language to support compound merging predictions.",
        "As the source language input is fluent, these features are more reliable than features derived from target language SMT output.",
        "(ii) We reduce compound parts to an underspecified representation which allows for maximal generalisation.",
        "(iii) We present a detailed manual evaluation methodology which shows that we obtain improved compound translations.",
        "We evaluated compound processing both on held-out split data and in end-to-end SMT.",
        "We show that using source language features increases the accuracy of compound generation.",
        "Moreover, we find more correct compounds than the base-lines, and a considerable number of these compounds are unseen in the training data.",
        "This is largely due to the underspecified representation we are using.",
        "Finally, we show that our approach improves upon the previous work.",
        "We discuss compound processing in SMT in Section 2, and summarise related work in Section 3.",
        "In Section 4 we present our method for splitting compounds and reducing the component words to an underspecified representation.",
        "The merging to obtain German compounds is the subject of Section 5.",
        "We evaluate the accuracy of compound prediction on held-out data in Section 6 and in end-to-end SMT experiments in Section 7.",
        "We conclude in Section 8.",
        "2 Dealing with Compounds in SMT In German, two (or more) single words (usually nouns or adjectives) are combined to form a compound which is considered a semantic unit.",
        "The rightmost part is referred to as the head while all other parts are called modifiers.",
        "EXAMPLE (1) lists different ways of joining simple words into compounds: mostly, no modification is required (A) or a filler letter is introduced (B).",
        "More rarely, a letter is deleted (C), or transformed (D).",

        "German compounds are highly productive, 1 and traditional SMT approaches often fail in the face of such productivity.",
        "Therefore, special processing of compounds is required for translation into German, as many compounds will not (e.g. Haus-boot, ?house boat?)",
        "or only rarely have been seen in the training data.",
        "2 In contrast, most compounds consist of two (or more) simple words that occur more frequently in the data than the compound as a whole (e.g. Haus (7,975) and Boot (162)) and of-ten, these compound parts can be translated 1-to- 1 into simple English words.",

        "as a simple word or as the head of a compound.",
        "Splitting compounds prior to translation model training enables better access to the component translations and allows for a high degree of generalisation.",
        "At testing time, the English text is translated into the split German representation, and only afterwards, some sequences of simple words are (re-)combined into (possibly unseen) compounds where appropriate.",
        "This merging of compounds is much more challenging than the splitting, as it has to be applied to disfluent MT output: i.e., compound parts may not occur in the correct word order and even if they do, not all sequences of German words that could form a compound should be merged.",

        "ting and merging, we thus report on previous approaches for both of these tasks.",
        "In the past, there have been numerous attempts to split compounds, all improving translation quality when translating from a compounding to a non-compounding language.",
        "Several compound splitting approaches make use of substring corpus frequencies in order to find the optimal split points of a compound (e.g. Koehn and Knight (2003), who allowed only ?(e)s?",
        "as filler letters).",
        "Stymne et al. (2008) use Koehn and Knight's technique, include a larger list of possible modifier transformations and apply POS restrictions on the substrings, while Fritzinger and Fraser (2010) use a morphological analyser to find only linguistically motivated sub-strings.",
        "In contrast, Dyer (2010) presents a lattice-based approach to encode different segmentations of words (instead of finding the one-best split).",
        "More recently, Macherey et al. (2011) presented a language-independent unsupervised approach in which filler letters and a list of words not to be split (e.g., named entities) are learned using phrase tables and Levenshtein distance.",
        "In contrast to splitting, the merging of compounds has received much less attention in the past.",
        "An early approach by Popovi?c et al. (2006) recombines compounds using a list of compounds and their parts.",
        "It thus never creates invalid German compounds, but on the other hand it is limited to the coverage of the list.",
        "Moreover, in some contexts a merging in the list may still be wrong, cf.",
        "EXAMPLE (3) in Section 5 below.",
        "The approach of Stymne (2009) makes use of a factored model, with a special POS-markup for compound mod-ifiers, derived from the POS of the whole compound.",
        "This markup enables sound mergings of compound parts after translation if the POS of the candidate modifier (X-Part) matches the POS of the candidate compound head (X): Inflations|N-Part + Rate|N = Inflationsrate|N (?inflation rate?).",

        "proach was extended to make use of a CRF sequence labeller (Lafferty et al., 2001) in order to find reasonable merging points.",
        "Besides the words and their POS, many different target language frequency features were defined to train the CRF.",
        "This approach can even produce new compounds unseen in the training data, provided that the modifiers occurred in modifier position of a compound and heads occurred as heads or even as simple words with the same inflectional endings.",
        "However, as former compound modifiers were left with their filler letters (cf.",
        "?Inflations?",
        "), they can not be generalised to compound heads or simple words, nor can inflectional variants of compound heads or simple words be created (e.g. if ?Rate?",
        "had only been observed in nominative form in the training data, the genitive ?Raten?",
        "could not be produced).",
        "The underspecified representation we are using allows for maximal generalisation over word parts independent of their position of occurrence or inflectional realisations.",
        "Moreover, their experiments were limited to predicting compounds on held-out data; no results were reported for using their approach in translation.",
        "In Fraser et al. (2012) we re-implemented the approach of Stymne and Cancedda (2011), combined it with inflection prediction and applied it to a translation task.",
        "However, compound merging was restricted to a list of compounds and parts.",
        "Our present work facilitates more independent combination.",
        "Toutanova et al. (2008) and Weller et al. (2013) used source language features for target language inflection, but to our knowledge, none of these works applied source language features for compound merging.",
        "4 Step 1: Underspecified Representation In order to enhance translation model accuracy, it is reasonable to have similar degrees of morphological richness between source and target language.",
        "We thus reduce the German target language training data to an underspecified represen-tation: we split compounds, and lemmatise all words (except verbs).",
        "All occurrences of simple words, former compound modifiers or heads have the same representation and can thus be freely merged into ?old?",
        "and ?new?",
        "compounds after translation, cf.",
        "Figure 1 above.",
        "So that we can later predict the merging of simple words into compounds and the inflection of the words, we store all of the morphological information stripped from the underspecified representation.",
        "Note that erroneous over-splitting might make the correct merging of compounds difficult 3 (or even impossible), due to the number of correct decisions required.",
        "For example, it requires only 1 correct prediction to recombine ?Niederschlag|Menge?",
        "into ?Niederschlags- menge?",
        "(?amount of precipitation?)",
        "but 3 for the wrong split into ?nie|der|Schlag|Menge?",
        "(?never|the|hit|amount?).",
        "We use the compound splitter of Fritzinger and Fraser (2010), who have shown that using a rule-based morphological analyser (SMOR, Schmid et al. (2004)) drastically reduced the number of erroneous splits when compared to the frequency-based approach of Koehn and Knight (2003).",
        "However, we adapted it to work on tokens: some words can, depending on their context, either be interpreted as named entities or common nouns, e.g., ?Dinkelacker?",
        "(a German beer brand or ?spelt|field?).",

        "This makes features derived from it more reliable than the target language features derived from disfluent SMT output.",
        "Moreover, source language features might support or block merging decisions in unclear cases, i.e., where target language frequencies are not helpful, either because they are very low or they have roughly equal frequency distributions when occurring in a compound (as modifier or head) vs. as a simple word.",

        "This way, the training data was less fluent than in its original format, but still of higher quality than SMT output of unseen data.",
        "In contrast, we left the training data as it was, but strongly reduced the feature set for CRF model training (e.g., no more use of surface words and POS tags, cf. TR and STR in Table 3) instead.",

        "Compound processing leads to improvements at the level of unigrams and as BLEU is dominated by four-gram precision and length penalty, it does not adequately reflect compound related improvements.",
        "We thus calculated the number of compounds matching the reference for each experiment and verified whether these were known to the training data.",
        "The numbers in Table 4 show that all compound processing systems outperform both baselines in terms of finding more exact reference matches and also more compounds unknown to the training data.",
        "Note that STR finds less reference matches than e.g. T or ST, but it also produces less compounds overall, i.e. it is more precise when producing compounds.",
        "However, as compounds that are correctly combined but poorly inflected are not counted, this is only a lower bound on true compounding performance.",
        "We thus performed two additional manual evaluations and show that the quality of the compounds (Section 7.2), and the human perception of translation quality is improving (Section 7.3).",

        "10 We: 10 In another evaluation, we investigated the 519 compounds that our system produced but which did not match the reference: 367 were correct translations of the English, 1. manually identify compounds in German reference text (1,105 found) 2. manually perform word alignment of these compounds to the English source text 3. project these English counterparts of compounds in the reference text to the decoded text using the ??print-alignment-info?",

        "Indirectly, this can also be seen from the low numbers of STR in category 2b), where the UNSPLIT baseline produces much more (101 vs. 54) translations that lexically match the reference without being a compound.",
        "While the 171 compounds of STR of category 3a) show that our system produces many compounds that are correct translations of the English, even though not matching the reference (and thus not credited by BLEU), the compounds of categories 2a) and 4a) contain examples where we either fail to reproduce the correct compound or over-generate compounds.",

        "Compared with the baselines, all of our experiments that included compound processing produced not only many more compounds matching the reference exactly, but also many compounds that did not occur in the training data.",
        "Taking a closer look, we found that some of these new compounds could only be produced due to the underspecified representation we are using, which allows us to generalise over occurrences of simple words, compound modifiers and heads.",
        "Moreover, we demonstrated that features derived from the source language are a valuable source of information for compound prediction: experiments were significantly better compared with contrastive experiments without these features.",
        "Additional manual evaluations showed that compound processing leads to improved translations where the improvement is not captured by BLEU.",
