        "With accuracies of over 97%, POS-tagging of WSJ can be treated as a solved problem (Man- ning, 2011).",
        "However, performance is still well below satisfactory for many other languages and domains (Petrov et al., 2012; Christodoulopoulos et al., 2010).",
        "There has been a line of research on using a tag-dictionary for POS-tagging (Merialdo, 1994; Toutanova and Johnson, 2007; Ravi and Knight, 2009; Garrette and Baldridge, 2012).",
        "The idea is compelling: on the one hand, a list of lexicons is often available for special domains, such as bio-informatics; on the other hand, compiling a ?",
        "Corresponding author.",
        "lexicon of word-tag pairs appears to be less time-consuming than annotating full sentences.",
        "However, success in type-supervised POS-tagging turns out to depend on several subtle factors.",
        "For example, recent research has found that the quality of the tag-dictionary is crucial to the success of such methods (Banko and Moore, 2004; Goldberg et al., 2008; Garrette and Baldridge, 2012).",
        "Banko and Moore (2004) found that the accuracies can drop from 96% to 77% when a hand-crafted tag dictionary is replaced with a raw tag dictionary gleaned from data, without any human intervention.",
        "These facts indicate that careful considerations need to be given for effective type-supervision.",
        "In addition, significant manual work might be required to ensure the quality of lexicons.",
        "To compare type- and token-supervised tagging, Garrette and Baldridge (2013) performed a set of experiments by conducting each type of annotation for two hours.",
        "They showed that for low-resource languages, a tag-dictionary can be reasonably effective if label propagation (Talukdar and Crammer, 2009) and model minimizations (Ravi and Knight, 2009) are applied to expand and filter the lexicons.",
        "Similar findings were reported in Garrette et al. (2013).",
        "Do the above findings carry over to the Chinese language?",
        "In this paper, we perform an empirical study on the effects of tag-dictionaries for domain adaptation of Chinese POS-tagging.",
        "We aim to answer the following research ques-tions: (a) Is domain adaptation feasible with only a target-domain lexicon?",
        "(b) Can we further improve type-supervised domain adaptation using unlabeled target-domain sentences?",
        "(c) Is crafting a tag dictionary for domain adaptation more effective than manually annotating target domain sentences, given similar efforts?",
        "Our investigations are performed under two Chinese-specific settings.",
        "First, unlike low-resource languages, large amounts of annotation 588 are available for Chinese.",
        "For example, the Chinese Treebank (CTB) (Xue et al., 2005) contains over 50,000 manually tagged news sentences.",
        "Hence rather than studying purely type-supervised POS-tagging, we make use of CTB as the source domain, and study domain adaptation to the Internet literature.",
        "Second, one uniqueness of Chinese POS-tagging, in contrast to the POS-tagging of alphabetical languages, is that word segmentation can be performed jointly to avoid error propagation (Ng and Low, 2004; Zhang and Clark, 2008; Kruengkrai et al., 2009; Zhang and Clark, 2010).",
        "We adopt this approach for a strong baseline.",
        "Previous studies showed that unsupervised domain adaptation can give moderate improvements (Liu and Zhang, 2012).",
        "We show that accuracies can be much more significantly improved by using target-domain knowledge in the form of lexicons.",
        "Both token-supervised and type-supervised domain adaptation rely on a set of source-domain annotations; while the former makes additional use of a small set of target annotations, the latter leverages a target-domain lexicon.",
        "We take a feature-based method, analogous to that of Daum√© III (2007), which tunes domain-dependent versions of features using domain-specific data.",
        "Our method tunes a set of lexicon-based features, so that domain-dependent models are derived from inserting domain-specific lexicons.",
        "The conceptually simple method worked highly effectively on a test set of 1,394 sentences from the Internet novel ?Zhuxian?.",
        "Combined with the use of unlabeled data, a tag lexicon of 3,000 words gave a 33% error reduction when compared with a strong baseline system trained using CTB data.",
        "We observe that joint use of type- and token-supervised domain adaptation is more cost-effective than pure type-or token-supervision.",
        "With 10 hours of annotation, the best error reduction reaches 47%, with F-score increasing from 80.81% to 89.84%.",
        "2 Baseline We take as the baseline system a discriminative joint segmentation and tagging model, proposed by Zhang and Clark (2010), together with simple self-training (Liu and Zhang, 2012).",
        "While the baseline discriminative model gives state-of-the-art joint segmentation and tagging accuracies on CTB data, the baseline self-training makes use of unlabeled target domain data to find improved target domain accuracies over bare CTB training.",
        "2.1 The Baseline Discriminative Chinese POS-Tagging Model The baseline discriminative model performs segmentation and POS-tagging simultaneously.",
        "Given an input sentence c 1 ?",
        "?",
        "?",
        "c n (c i refers to the ith character in the sentence), it operates incre-mentally, from left to right.",
        "At each step, the current character can either be appended to the last word of the existing partial output, or seperated as the start of a new word with tag p. A beam is used to maintain the N-best partial results at each step during decoding.",
        "At step i (0 ?",
        "i < n), each item in the beam corresponds to a segmentation and POS-tagging hypothesis for the first i?1 char-acters, with the last word being associated with a POS, but marked as incomplete.",
        "When the next character c i is processed, it is combined with all the partial results from the beam to generate new partial results, using two types of actions: (1) Ap-pend, which appends c i to the last (partial) word in a partial result; (2) Separate(p), which makes the last word in the partial result as completed and adds c i as a new partial word with a POS tag p. Partial results in the beam are scored globally over all actions used to build them, so that the N-best can be put back to the agenda for the next step.",
        "For each action, features are extracted differently.",
        "We use the features from Zhang and Clark (2010).",
        "Discriminative learning with early-update (Collins and Roark, 2004; Zhang and Clark, 2011) is used to train the model with beam-search.",
        "2.2 Baseline Unsupervised Adaptation by Self-Training A simple unsupervised approach for POS-tagging with unlabeled data is EM.",
        "For a generative model such as HMM, EM can locally maximize the likelihood of training data.",
        "Given a good start, EM can result in a competitive HMM tagging model (Goldberg et al., 2008).",
        "For discriminative models with source-domain training examples, an initial model can be trained using the source-domain data, and self-training can be applied to find a locally-optimized model using raw target domain sentences.",
        "The training process is sometimes associated with the EM algorithm.",

        "reduction on target-domain data when compared with source domain training.",
        "Their method is simple to implement, and we take it as our baseline.",
        "3 Type-Supervised Domain Adaptation To give a formal definition of the domain adaptation tasks, we denote by C s a set of annotated source-domain sentences, C t a set of annotated target-domain sentences, and L t an annotated target-domain lexicon.",
        "The form of L t is a list of target-domain words, each associated with a set of POS tags.",
        "Token-supervised domain adaptation is the task of making use of C s and C t to improve target-domain performances, while type-supervised domain adaptation is to make use of C s and L t instead for the same purpose.",
        "As described in the introduction, type-supervised domain adaptation is useful when annotated sentences are absent, but lexicons are available.",
        "In addition, it is an interesting question which type of annotation is more cost-effective when neither is available.",
        "We empirically compare the two approaches by proposing a novel method for type-supervised domain adaptation of a discriminate tagging model, showing that it can be a favourable choice in practical situation.",
        "In particular, we split Chinese words into domain-independent and domain-specific cate-gories, and define unlexicalized features for domain-specific words.",
        "We train lexicalized domain-independent and unlexicalized domain-specific features using the source domain annotated sentences and a source-domain lexicon, and then apply the resulting model to the target domain by replacing the source-domain lexicon with a target domain lexicon.",
        "Combined with unsupervised learning with unlabeled target-domain of sentences, the conceptually simple method worked highly effectively.",
        "Following Garrette and Baldridge (2013), we address practical questions on type-supervised domain adaptation by comparison with token-supervised methods under similar human annotation efforts.",
        "3.1 System Architecture Our method is based on the intuition that domain-specific words of certain types (e.g. proper names) can behave similarly across domains.",
        "For exam-ple, consider the source-domain sentence ???",
        "?|NR (Jiang Zemin) ?",
        "?|AD (afterwards) ?",
        "?|VV (visit) ?",
        "?|NR (Shanghai Automobiles Corp.)?",
        "and the target-domain sentence ??",
        "?|NR (Biyao) ?",
        "?|AD (afterwards) ?",
        "?|VV (arrive) ??",
        "?|NR (the Bamboo Mountains)?.",
        "????",
        "(Jiang Zemin)?",
        "and ???",
        "(Biyao)?",
        "are person names in the two domains, respectively, whereas ???",
        "(Shanghai Automobiles Corp.)?",
        "and ????",
        "(the Bamboo Mountains)?",
        "are location names in the two domains, respectively.",
        "If the four words are simply treated as domain-specific nouns, the two sentences both have the pattern ??domain-NR?",
        "AD VV ?domain-NR?",
        "?, and hence source domain training data can be useful in training the distributions of the lexicon-based features for both domains.",
        "Further, we assume that the syntax structures and the usage of function words do not vary significantly across domains.",
        "For example, verbs, adjectives or proper nouns can be different from domain to domain, but the subject-verb-object sentence structure does not change.",
        "In addition, the usage of closed-set function words remains stable across different domains.",
        "In the CTB tagset, closed-set POS tags are the vast majority.",
        "Under this assumption, we introduce a set of unlexicalized features into the discriminative model, in order to capture the distributions of domain-specific dictionary words.",
        "Unlexicalized features trained for source domain words can carry over to the target domain.",
        "The overall architecture of our sys-590 Action Lexicon Feature templates Separate in-lex(w ?1 ), l(w ?1 ) ?",

        "to the model for different do-mains, and one model trained from the source domain can be applied to many different target do-mains, as long as a lexicon is available.",
        "The method can be the most effective when there is a significant amount of domain-independent words in the data, which provide rich lexicalized contexts for estimating unlexicalized features for domain-specific words.",
        "For scientific domains (e.g. the biomedical domain) which share a significant proportion of common words with the news domain, and have most domain specific words being nouns (e.g.",
        "????",
        "(dia- betes)?",
        "), the method can be the most effective.",
        "We choose a comparatively difficult domain pair (e.g. modern news v.s.",
        "ancient style novel), for which the use of many word types are quite different.",
        "Results on this data can be relatively more indicative of the usefulness of the method.",
        "3.2 Lexicon-Based Features Table 1 shows the set of new unlexicalized features for the domain-specific lexicons.",
        "In addition to words and POS tags, length information is also encoded in the features, to capture different distributions of different word sizes.",
        "For example, a one-character word in the dictionary might not be identified as confidently using the lexicon as a three-character word in the dictionary.",
        "To acquire a domain-specific lexicon for the source domain, we use HowNet (Dong and Dong, 2006) to classify CTB words into domain-independent and domain-specific categories.",
        "Consisting of semantic information for nearly 100,000 common Chinese words, HowNet can serve as a resource of domain-independent Chinese words.",
        "We choose out of all words in the source domain training data those that also occur in HowNet for domain-independent words, and out of the remaining words those that occur more than 3 times for words specific to the source domain.",
        "We assume that the domain-independent lexicon applies to all target domains also.",
        "For some target domains, we can obtain domain-specific terminologies easily from the Internet.",
        "However, this can be a very small portion depending on the domain.",
        "Thus, it may still be necessary to obtain new lexicons by manual annotation.",
        "3.3 Lexicon and Self-Training The lexicon-based features can be combined with unsupervised learning to further improve target-domain accuracies.",
        "We apply self-training on top of the lexicon-based features in the following way: we train a lexicon-based model M using a lexicon L s of the source domain, and then apply M together with a target-domain lexicon L t to automatically label a set of target domain sentences.",
        "We combine the automatically labeled target sentences with the source-domain training data to obtain an extended set of training data, and train a final model M self , using the lexicon L s and L t for source- and target-domain data, respectively.",
        "Different numbers of target domain sentences can be used for self-training.",
        "Liu and Zhang (2012) showed that an increased amount of target sentences do not constantly lead to improved development accuracies.",
        "They use character perplexity to order target domain sentences, taking the top K sentences for self-training.",
        "They evaluate the optimal development accuracies using a range of different Kvalues, and select the best K for a final model.",
        "This method gave better results than using sentences in the internet novel in their original order (Liu and Zhang, 2012).",
        "We follow this method in ranking target domain sentences.",
        "4 Experiments 4.1 Setting We use annotated sentences from the CTB5 for source-domain training, splitting the corpus into training, development and test sections in the same way as previous work (Kruengkrai et al., 2009; Zhang and Clark, 2010; Sun, 2011).",

        "These methods assume that lexicon can be obtained by manual annotation or semi-supervised learning, and use the lexicon to induce tag sequences on unlabeled sentences.",
        "We study type-supervised Chinese POS-tagging, but under the setting of domain adaptation.",
        "The problem is how to leverage a target domain lexicon and an available annotated resources in a different source domain to improving POS-tagging.",
        "Consistent 594 with Garrette et al. (2013), we also find that the type-supervised method is a competitive choice to token-supervised adaptation.",
        "There has been a line of work on using graph-based label propagation to expand tag-lexicons for POS-tagging (Subramanya et al., 2010; Das and Petrov, 2011).",
        "Similar methods have been applied to character-level Chinese tagging (Zeng et al., 2013).",
        "We found that label propagation from neither the source domain nor auto-labeled target domain sentences can improve domain adaptation.",
        "The main reason could be significant domain differences.",
        "Due to space limitations, we omit this negative result in our experiments.",
        "With respect to domain adaptation, existing methods can be classified into three categories.",
        "The first category does not explicitly model differences between the source and target domains, but use standard semi-supervised learning methods with labeled source domain data and unlabeled target domain data (Dai et al., 2007; Raina et al., 2007).",
        "The baseline self-training approach (Liu and Zhang, 2012) belongs to this category.",
        "The second considers the differences in the two domains in terms of features (Blitzer et al., 2006; Daum√© III, 2007), classifying features into domain-independent source domain and target domain groups and training these types consistently.",
        "The third considers differences between the distributions of instances in the two domains, treating them differently (Jiang and Zhai, 2007).",
        "Our type-supervised method is closer to the second category.",
        "However, rather than splitting features into domain-independent and domain-specific types, we use domain-specific dictionaries to capture domain differences, and train a model on the source domain only.",
        "Our method can be treated as an approach specific to the POS-tagging task.",
        "With respect to Chinese lexical analysis, little previous work has been reported on using a tag dictionary to improve joint segmentation and POS-tagging.",
        "There has been work on using a lexicon in improving segmentation in a Chinese analysis pipeline.",
        "Peng et al. (2004) used features from a set of Chinese words and characters to improve CRF-based segmentation; Low et al. (2005) extracted features based on a Chinese lexicon from Peking University to help a maximum segmentor; Sun (2011) collected 12,992 idioms from Chinese dictionaries, and used them for rule-based pre-segmentation; Hatori et al. (2012) collected Chinese words from HowNet and the Chinese Wikipedia to enhance segmentation accuracies of their joint dependency parsing systems.",
        "In comparison with their work, our lexicon contain additional POS information, and are used for word segmentation and POS-tagging simultaneously.",
        "In addition, we separate domain-dependent lexicons for the source and target lexicons, and use a novel framework to perform domain adaptation.",
        "Wang et al. (2011) collect word-tag statistics from automatically labeled texts, and use them as features to improve POS-tagging.",
        "Their word-tag statistics can be treated as a type of lexicon.",
        "How-ever, their efforts differ from ours in several as-pects: (1) they focus on in-domain POS-tagging, while our concern is cross-domain tagging; (2) they study POS-tagging on segmented sentences, while we investigate joint segmentation and POS-tagging for Chinese; (3) their tag-dictionaries are not tag-dictionaries literally, but statistics of word-tag associations.",
        "6 Conclusions We performed an empirical study on the use of tag-dictionaries for the domain adaptation of joint Chinese segmentation and POS-tagging, showing that type-supervised methods can be a competitive alternative to token-supervised methods in cost-effectiveness.",
        "In addition, combination of the two methods gives the best cost-effect.",
