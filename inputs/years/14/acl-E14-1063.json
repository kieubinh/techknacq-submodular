        "Translating negation is a task that involves more than the correct rendering of a negation marker in the target sentence.",
        "For instance, translating Italy did not defeat France in 1909 differs from translating Italy defeated France in 1909, or France did not defeat Italy in 1909, or Italy did not conquer France in 1909.",
        "These examples show that translating negation also involves placing in the right position the semantic arguments as well as the event directly negated.",
        "Moreover, if the source sentence was uttered in response to the statement I think Italy defeated France in 1911, where the focus is the temporal argument in 1911, one can see that the system should not lose track of the focus of negation when producing the hypothesis translation.",
        "Although negation must be appropriately rendered to ensure correct representation of the semantics of the source sentence in the machine out-put, only some of the efforts to improve the translation of negation-bearing sentences in SMT address the problem.",
        "Wetzel and Bond (2012) considered negation as a problem of data sparsity and so attempted to enrich the training data with negative paraphrases of positive sentences.",
        "Collins et al. (2005) and Li et al. (2009) both addressed differences in the placement of negation in source and target texts, by re-ordering negative elements in the source sentence to better resemble their position in the corresponding target text.",
        "Although these approaches show improvement over the baseline, neither considers negation as a linguistic phenomenon with specific characteristics.",
        "This we do in the work presented here: We identify the elements of negation that an MT system has to reproduce and then devise a strategy to ensure that they are output correctly.",
        "These elements we take to be the cue, event and scope of nega-tion1.",
        "Unlike previous works, we first validate the hypothesis that if the top-ranked translation in the n-best list does not replicate elements of negation from the source, there may be a more accurate translation after decoding, somewhere else on the n-best list.",
        "If the hypothesis is false, then problems in the translation of negation lie elsewhere.",
        "1Due to its ambiguity and the fact that it is already included in the scope, we have ignored the focus of negation.",
        "That does not mean it may not be important to correctly reproduce the focus; there might be cases where, although not fully-capturing the scope, we want to translate correctly the part that is directly negated or emphasised.",
        "598 We use dependency parsing as a basis for N-best list re-ranking.",
        "Dependencies between lexical elements appear to encode all elements of nega-tion, offering a robust and easily-applicable way to extract negation-related information from a sentence.",
        "We carry out our exploration of N-best list re-ranking in two steps: ?",
        "First, an oracle translation is computed both to assess the validity of the approach and to understand the maximal extent to which it could possibly enhance performance.",
        "An oracle translation is obtained by performing n-best list re-ranking using reference translations as a gold-standard.",
        "To avoid the problem in Chinese-English Hierarchical Phrase-Based (HPB) translation of loss and/or misplacement of negation-related elements when hierarchical phrases are built, Chinese source sentences are first broken into sub-clauses Yang and Xue (2012), then translated and finally ?stitched?",
        "back together for evaluation.",
        "?",
        "Standard n-best list re-ranking is then performed using only source-side information.",
        "Hypotheses are re-ranked according to the degree of similarity between the negation-related elements in the hypotheses and those in the source sentence.",
        "Here the correspondence between source and target text is established through lexical translation probabilities output after training.",
        "Results of this method show that n-best list rerank-ing does lead to a significant improvement in BLEU score.",
        "However, BLEU says nothing about semantics, so we also evaluate the method using Stanford's entailment basedMTmetrics Pad?",
        "et al. (2009), and also show improvement here.",
        "In the final section of the paper, we note the value of developing a custom metric that actually assesses the components of negation.",
        "2 Related works Negation has been a widely discussed topic outside the field of SMT, with recent works focused mainly on automatic detection of negation.",
        "Blanco and Moldovan (2011) have established the distribution of negative cues and the syntactic structures in which they appear in the WSJ section of the Penn Treebank, as a basis for automatically detecting scope and focus of negation using simple heuristics.",
        "Machine-learning has been used by systems participating in the *SEM 2012 shared task on automatically detecting the scope and focus of negation.",
        "Those systems with the best F1 measures (Chowdhury and Mahbub (2012), Read et al. (2012) and Lapponi et al. (2012) all use a mixture of SVM (Support Vector Machines) and CRF.",
        "Their performance improves significantly when syntactic features are also considered.",
        "In partic-ular, Lapponi et al. (2012) use features extracted from a dependency parse to guide their system to detect the correct scope boundary.",
        "In translation, only few efforts have focussed on the problem of translating negation.",
        "Wetzel and Bond (2012) treat it as resulting from data sparsity.",
        "To remedy this, they enrich their Japanese-to-English training set with negative paraphrases of positive sentences, where negation is inserted as a ?handle?",
        "to the main verb after a sentence is parsed using MSR (Minimal Recursion Semantics Copestake et al. (2005)).",
        "Results show that BLEU score improves on a test sub-set containing only negative sentences when extra negative data is appended to the original training data and the language model is enriched as well.",
        "However, system performance deteriorates on both the original test set and on positive sentences.",
        "Moreover, generating paraphrases with negation expressed only on the main verb does not allow to fully capture the various ways negation can be expressed.",
        "Other works considered negation in the framework of clause restructuring.",
        "Collins et al. (2005) pre-process the German source to resemble the structure of English while Li et al. (2009) tried to swap the order of the words in a Chinese sentence to resemble Korean.",
        "Rosa (2013) takes a post-processing approach to negation in English-Czech translation, ?fixing?",
        "common errors such as the loss of a negation cue by either generating the morphologically negative form of the relevant verb (if the verb has such a form) or prefixing the verb with the negative prefix ne.",
        "Despite the improve-ments, these approaches do not really address what is special about negation.",
        "3 Decomposing negation Correctly translating negation involves more than placing a negative marker in the right position.",
        "We follow Blanco andMoldovan (2011) in decomposing negation into three main components: 599 ?",
        "a negation cue, including negative markers, affixes and all the words or multiwords units that inherently express negation.",
        "?",
        "a negation event, i.e. the event that is directly negated.",
        "Events can be either verbs (e.g. ?I do not go to the cinema) or adjectives (e.g. ?He is not clever?).",
        "?",
        "a negation scope, i.e. the part of the statement whose meaning is negated (Blanco and Moldovan, 2011, 229).",
        "The scope contains all those words that, if negated, would make the statement true.",
        "We follow here the guidelines for annotating negative data released during the *SEM 2012 Shared Task Morante et al. (2011) for a more detailed understanding on what to consider part of the negation scope.",
        "In addition to these three components, formal semanticists identify a negation focus, i.e. the part of the scope that is directly negated or more emphasized.",
        "Focus is the most difficult part to detect since it is the most ambiguous.",
        "In the sentence ?he does not want to go to school by car?",
        "the speaker emphasized the fact that ?he does not want to go to school by car?",
        "or that ?he does not want to go to school by car?",
        "(but he wants to go somewhere else) or that ?he does not want to go to school by car?",
        "(but by other means of transportation).",
        "Translating negation is therefore a matter of ensuring that the cue is present, that its attachment to the corresponding event follows language-specific rules and that all the elements included in the scope are placed in the right order.",
        "Correctly reproducing the focus is left for future works.",
        "4 Methodology 4.1 N-best list re-ranking N-best list re-ranking is used in SMT to deal with sentence-level phenomena whose locality goes beyond n-grams or single hierarchical rules.",
        "It involves re-ranking the list of target-language hypotheses produced by decoding, using additional features extracted from the source sentence.",
        "In the case of negation, N-best list re-ranking allows us to assess whether a system is able to correctly translate the elements of negation, while failing to place the best hypothesis on these grounds at the top of the n-best list.",
        "The current work follows the same approach as other n-best list re-rankers (Och et al. (2004); Spe-cia et al. (2008); Apidianaki et al. (2012)) but using negation as the additional feature.",
        "Negation is here defined as the degree of overlap of cue, event and scope between the hypothesis translation and the source sentence.",
        "Following Hasan et al. (2007), we use an n-best list of 10000 sentences but we do not initially tune the negation feature using MERT or interpolate it with other features.",
        "This is because in order to assess the degree of overlap between the scope in the source and the hypothesis sentence, a n-gram based score is used which conveys the same information as that of the language model score in the log-linear model.",
        "Moreover, our re-ranking exploits lexical translation probabilities, thereby resembling a simple translation model.",
        "4.2 Extract negation using dependency parsing The degree of overlap between the source sentence and the hypothesis translation is measured in terms of the overlap between their negation cue, event and scope.",
        "These must therefore be correctly extracted.",
        "Dependency parsing provides an efficient way to do so, with several advantages: ?",
        "Dependency parsing encodes the notions of cue and event as the dependant and the head respectively of a ?neg?",
        "relation.",
        "Scope can be approximated through recursive retrieval of all the descendants of the verb-event.",
        "The following example shows how these elements are extracted from the dependency parse: Peter and conj \u000f\u000f conj \u000f\u000f Mary did not buy nsubj \u000f\u000f punct \u000f\u000f obj \u000f\u000f aux \u000f\u000f neg \u000f\u000f a blue car det \u000f\u000f amod \u000f\u000f .",
        "nsubj(buy-6, and-2) , conj(and-2, Peter-1), conj (and-2, Mary-3), aux(buy-6, did-4), neg(buy-6, not-5), root(ROOT-0, buy-6), det(car-9, a-7), amod(car-9, blue-8) , dobj(buy-6, car-9) The ?neg?",
        "dependency relation conveys both the negation cue (not-5) and the negation event (buy-6) of the sentence ?Peter andMary did not buy a blue car?.",
        "An approximate scope can be recovered by following the path from the event (included) to the terminal nodes and collecting all the lexical elements along the way.",
        "Also in the case of a sentence containing a subordinate clause, dependency parsing is 600 able to correctly capture the latter as part of the scope given that the relative pronoun depends directly on the event of the main clause.",
        "On the other hand, recursion from the negated event excludes coordinate clauses that are not considered part of the scope, given that the event is a dependant of the connective.",
        "One problem with this method is that it is unable to capture the entire scope when the head is nominal.",
        "For instance, ?no reasons were given?, the ?neg?",
        "dependency holds between no and reasons but it needs to climb the hierarchy further to get to the verbal head given.",
        "The same holds for negation on object nominals.",
        "We leave this to future work (along with affix-conveyed negation), needing to show first that the current approach is a good one.",
        "?",
        "A dependency parser can be developed for any language for which a Treebank or Propbank is available for training.",
        "This extends the range of source languages to which the approach can be applied.",
        "4.3 Computing an oracle translation In order to test the validity of the method and to assess its maximum contribution, we first use it with an oracle translation in which n-best list re-ranking relies on a comparison with negation cue, event and scope extracted from the reference trans-lation(s), here assumed to correctly contain all elements of negation.",
        "Each hypothesis on the n-best list is assigned an overlap score with these reference-translation-derived elements, and the hypothesis with the highest score is re-ranked at the top and used for evaluation.",
        "The overlap score is obtained by summing up three sub-scores: (i) the cue overlap score measures how many cues in reference are represented in the hypothesis, normalised by the number of cues in the reference; (ii) the event overlap score measures how many events in the reference are represented in the hypothesis, normalised by the number of the events in the reference; and (iii) the scope overlap score is a weighted n-gram overlap between hypothesis scope and reference scope, with higher weight for higher-order n-grams.",
        "Given less-than-perfect machine out-put, breaking down the score into subscores allows us to consider different degrees of correctness in translating negation.",
        "When multiple reference translations are available, the hypothesis is matched with each, and only the best score taken into consideration.",
        "4.4 Re-ranking using lexical translation probabilities After the oracle translation is computed, traditional n-best list re-ranking is performed relying on source side information only.",
        "We then bridge the gap between source and target language using lexical translation probabilities to render source-side cue, event, scope into the target language.",
        "Re-ranking involves three separate steps: ?",
        "The source sentence is parsed and dependencies extracted.",
        "Since the present work tackles Chinese-to-English translation, we had to enhance the representation of negative dependencies in the Chinese source, where only the adverb ?",
        "bu4 is flagged as ?neg?",
        "dependant.",
        "To do this, we follow the same intuition used to isolate negation-bearing sentences in the test set (see section 5).",
        "?",
        "To obtain a rough translation of cue, event and scope in the target language, the top ten lexical translation probabilities for each lexical item, available in the lexical translations (in order of probability) table output after train-ing, are considered.",
        "?",
        "Hypotheses in the n-best list are re-scored taking into consideration the information above.",
        "Scoring cue and event is straightforward; the words for the cue and the event are assigned the lexical probability of being the translation of the cue and the event in the Chinese sentence by looking up the lexical translation table.",
        "If the cue or the event do not figure as translations of the negation cue and event in the Chinese sentence, a score of 0 is assigned to them.",
        "The scope is instead scored by looping through the words in the hypothesis; for each such hypothesis word, the process identifies which source-side scopeword it is most likely to be the translation of.",
        "If no scope can be re-trieved, a score of 0 is given for scope matching.",
        "For each word the best translation probability is taken into account and these are then summed together to score how likely is the 601 scope in the hypothesis to be the translation of the scope in the source.",
        "5 System A hierarchical phrase based model (HPBM) was trained on a corpus of 625000 (?",
        "18.200.000 to-kens) length-ratio filtered sentences.",
        "56949 sentences (?",
        "9.11%) of the Chinese side and 48941 sentences (?",
        "7.83%) of the English side of the training set were found to include at least one instance of negation.",
        "2500 sentences were instead included in the dev set to tune the log-linear model using the MERT algorithm.",
        "3725 sentences from the Multiple-Translation Chinese Corpus 2.0 (LDC2002T01) were used as test set.",
        "The test set comes divided into four sub-sets; in this paper these sub-sets are referred as test set 1 to 4.",
        "The source side was tokenized using the Stanford Chi-neseWord Segmenter (Tseng et al. (2005)) and encoded in ?utf-8?",
        "so to serve as input to the system.",
        "In order to focus on the problem of translating negative data, the 563 sentence pairs containing negation were extracted from the original test set.",
        "This test set constitutes the true baseline improvements will be measured upon.",
        "Reducing the number of test sentences also eases the computation load when involved in dependency parsing on 10.000 sentences in each n-best list.",
        "Negated sentence were isolated by means of both regular expressions and dependency parsing; this is because, as pointed out above, the Chinese side does not flag all negative dependencies as such.2 6 Results 6.1 Baseline BLEU scores for the baseline systems are given in Table 1, where the negative subset is compared to the original (all sentences) and only positive sentences conditions.",
        "Table 2 shows instead the result for the negative baseline across three different metrics.",
        "Along with the BLEU scores, we also took into consideration an entailment-based MT evaluation metric, 2While the English dependency parser is able to identify almost all negative markers and their dependencies, the Chinese dependency parser here deployed (the Stanford Chinese Dependency parser) only captures sentences containing the adverb ?bu4.",
        "For this reason, we exploited the list of negation adverbs included in the Chinese Propbank (LDC2005T23) documentation and look for each of them via regular expressions.",
        "Moreover we also looked for words containing ?",
        "as component since they are most likely to carry negative meaning (e.g.",
        "?",
        "?, ?not-long?).",
        "the RTE score3 Pad?",
        "et al. (2009).",
        "The RTE score assesses to what extent the hypothesis entails the reference translation across a wide variety of semantic and syntactic features.",
        "Another reason we chose this metric is because it contains a feature for polarity as well as features to check the degree of similarity between the syntactic tree and the dependencies between hypothesis and reference transla-tion, the latter being what we used to recover the elements of negation.",
        "We expect this metric to give a further insight on the quality of the machine output.",
        "Baseline results are in line with the results of Wetzel and Bond (2012), where there is a drop in BLEU scores between positive and negative sen-tences, and between the overall test set and the one containing negative data only.",
        "When analysing the results from the baseline, we noticed that words were being deleted or moved inappropriately when the hierarchy of phrases was being built.",
        "This might be detrimental to the translation of negation since elements might end up outside the correct negation scope.",
