        "Since then, research has involved a variety of approaches and been conducted on various type of data, e.g., product reviews, news, blogs, and the more recent social media text.",
        "As sentiment has been an important concern in monolingual settings, better translation of such information between languages could be of interest to help better cross language barriers, particularly for sentiment-abundant data.",
        "Even when we randomly sampled a subset of sentence pairs from the NIST Open MT1 training data, we found that about 48.2% pairs contain at least one sentiment word on both sides, and 22.4% pairs contain at least one 1 http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/mt intensifier word on both sides, which suggests a non-trivial percent of sentences may potentially involve sentiment in some degree2.",

        "One expects that sentiment has been implicitly captured in SMT through the statistics learned from parallel corpus, e.g., the phrase tables in a phrase-based system.",
        "In this paper, we are interested in explicitly modeling sentiment knowledge for translation.",
        "We propose a lexicon-based approach that examines the consistency of bilingual subjec-tivity, sentiment polarity, intensity, and negation.",
        "The experiments show that the proposed approach improves the NIST Chinese-to-English translation over a strong baseline.",
        "In general, we hope this line of work will help achieve better MT quality, especially for data with more abundant sentiment, such as social media text.",
        "2 Related Work Sentiment analysis and lexicon-based approaches Research on monolingual sentiment analysis can be found under different names such as opinion, stance, appraisal, and semantic orientation, among others.",
        "The overall goal is to label a span of text either as positive, negative, or neutral ?",
        "sometimes the strength of sentiment is a concern too.",
        "2 The numbers give a rough idea of sentiment coverage; it would be more ideal if the estimation could be conducted on senses instead of words, which, however, requires reliable sense labeling and is not available at this stage.",
        "Also, according to our human evaluation on a smaller dataset, two thirds of such potentially sentimental sentences do convey sentiment.",
        "3 The sentiment and intensifier lexicons used to acquire these numbers are discussed in Section 3.2.",
        "607 The granularities of text have spanned from words and phrases to passages and documents.",
        "Sentiment analysis has been approached mainly as an unsupervised or supervised problem, although the middle ground, semi-supervised ap-proaches, exists.",
        "In this paper, we take a lexicon-based, unsupervised approach to considering sentiment consistency for translation, although the translation system itself is supervised.",
        "The advantages of such an approach have been discussed in (Taboada et al., 2011).",
        "Briefly, it is good at capturing the basic sentiment expressions common to different domains, and certainly it requires no bilingual sentiment-annotated data for our study.",
        "It suits our purpose here of exploring the basic role of sentiment for translation.",
        "Also, such a method has been reported to achieve a good cross-domain performance (Taboada et al., 2011) comparable with that of other state-of-the-art models.",
        "Translation for sentiment analysis A very interesting line of research has leveraged labeled data in a resource-rich language (e.g., English) to help sentiment analysis in a resource-poorer language.",
        "This includes the idea of constructing sentiment lexicons automatically by using a translation dictionary (Mihalcea et al., 2007), as well as the idea of utilizing parallel corpora or automatically translated documents to incorporate sentiment-labeled data from different languages (Wan, 2009; Mihalcea et al., 2007).",
        "Our concern here is different ?",
        "instead of utilizing translation for sentiment analysis; we are interested in the SMT quality itself, by modeling bilingual sentiment in translation.",
        "As mentioned above, while we expect that statistics learned from parallel corpora have implicitly captured sentiment in some degree, we are curious if better modeling is possible.",
        "Considering semantic similarity in translation The literature has included interesting ideas of incorporating different types of semantic knowledge for SMT.",
        "A main stream of recent efforts have been leveraging semantic roles (Wu and Fung, 2009; Liu and Gildea, 2010; Li et al., 2013) to improve translation, e.g., through improving reordering.",
        "Also, Chen et al. (2010) have leveraged sense similarity between source and target side as additional features.",
        "In this work, we view a different dimension, i.e., semantic orientation, and show that incorporating such knowledge improves the translation performance.",
        "We hope this work would add more evidences to the existing literature of leveraging semantics for SMT, and shed some light on further exploration of semantic consistency, e.g., examining other semantic differential factors.",
        "3 Problem & Approach 3.1 Consistency of sentiment Ideally, sentiment should be properly preserved in high-quality translation.",
        "An interesting study conducted by Mihalcea et al. (2007) suggests that in most cases the sentence-level subjectivity is preserved by human translators.",
        "In their experiments, one English and two Romanian native speakers were asked to independently annotate the sentiment of English-Romanian sentence pairs from the SemCor corpus (Miller et al., 1993), a balanced corpus covering a number of topics in sports, poli-tics, fashion, education, and others.",
        "These human subjects were restricted to only access and annotate the sentiment of their native-language side of sentence pairs.",
        "The sentiment consistency was observed by examining the annotation on both sides.",
        "Automatic translation should conform to such a consistency too, which could be of interest for many applications, particularly for sentiment-abundant data.",
        "On the other hand, if consistency is not preserved for some reason, e.g., alignment noise, enforcing consistency may help improve the translation performance.",
        "In this paper, we explore bilingual sentiment consistency for translation.",
        "3.2 Lexicon-based bilingual sentiment analysis To capture bilingual sentiment consistency, we use a lexicon-based approach to sentiment analysis.",
        "Based on this, we design four groups of features to represent the consistency.",
        "The basic idea of the lexicon-based approach is first identifying the sentiment words, intensifiers, and negation words with lexicons, and then calculating the sentiment value using manually designed formulas.",
        "To this end, we adapted the approaches of (Taboada et al., 2011) and (Zhang et al., 2012) so as to use the same formulas to analyze the sentiment on both the source and the target side.",
        "The English and Chinese sentiment lexicons we used are from (Wilson et al. 2005) and (Xu and Lin, 2007), respectively.",
        "We further use 75 English in-608 tensifiers listed in (Benzinger, 1971; page 171) and 81 Chinese intensifiers from (Zhang et al., 2012).",
        "We use 17 English and 13 Chinese negation words.",
        "Similar to (Taboada et al., 2011) and (Zhang et al., 2012), we assigned a numerical score to each sentiment word, intensifier, and negation word.",
        "More specifically, one of the five values: -0.8, -0.4, 0, 0.4, and 0.8, was assigned to each sentiment word in both the source and target sentiment lexi-cons, according to the strength information annotated in these lexicons.",
        "The scores indicate the strength of sentiment.",
        "Table 2 lists some examples.",
        "Similarly, one of the 4 values, i.e., -0.5, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9, was manually assigned to each intensifier word, and a -0.8 or -0.6 to the negation words.",
        "All these scores will be used below to modify and shift the sentiment value of a sentiment unit.",
        "Sentiment words Intensifiers Negation words impressive (0.8) good (0.4) actually (0.0) worn (-0.4) depressing (-0.8) extremely (0.9) very (0.7) pretty (0.5) slightly (-0.5) not (-0.8) rarely (-0.6) Table 2: Examples of sentiment words and their sentiment strength; intensifiers and their modify rate; negation words and their negation degree.",
        "Each sentiment word and its modifiers (negation words and intensifiers) form a sentiment unit.",
        "We first found all sentiment units by identifying sentiment words with the sentiment lexicons and their modifiers with the corresponding lexicon in a 7- word window.",
        "Then, for different patterns of sentiment unit, we calculated the sentiment values using the formulas listed in Table 3, where these formulas are adapted from (Taboada et al., 2011) and (Zhang et al., 2012) so as to be applied to both languages.",
        "Sen. unit Sen. value formula Example Sen. value ws S(ws) good 0.40 wnws D(wn)S(ws) not good -0.32 wiws (1+R(wi))S(ws) very good 0.68 wnwiws (1+ D(wn)R(wi))S(ws) not very good 0.176 wiwnws D(wn)(1+R(wi))S(ws) very not good 4 -0.544 Table 3: Heuristics used to compute the lexicon-based sentiment values for different types of sentiment units.",
        "4 The expression ?very not good?",
        "is ungrammatical in English.",
        "However, in Chinese, it is possible to have this kind of expres-sion, such as ?????",
        "?, whose transliteration is ?very not beautiful?, meaning ?very ugly?.",
        "For notation, S(ws) stands for the strength of sentiment word ws, R(wi) is degree of the intensifier word wi, and D(wn) is the negation degree of the negation word wn.",
        "Above, we have calculated the lexicon based sentiment value (LSV) for any given unit ui, and we call it lsv(ui) below.",
        "If a sentence or phrase s contains multiple sentiment units, its lsv-score is a merge of the individual lsv-scores of all its sentiment units: )))((()( 1 iN ulsvbasismergslsv ?",
        "(1) where the function basis(.)",
        "is a normalization function that performs on each lsv(ui).",
        "For example, the basis(.)",
        "function could be a standard sign function that just examines if a sentiment unit is positive or negative, or simply an identity function (using the lsv-scores directly).",
        "The merg(.)",
        "is a function that merge the lsv-scores of individual sentiment units, which may take several different forms below in our feature design.",
        "For example, it can be a mean function to take the average of the sentiment units?",
        "lsv-scores, or a logic OR function to examine if a sentence or phrase contains positive or negative units (depending on the basis function).",
        "It can also be a linear function that gives different weights to different units according to further knowledge, e.g., syntactic information.",
        "In this paper, we only leverage the basic, surface-level analysis5.",
        "In brief, our model here can be thought of as a unification and simplification of both (Taboada et al., 2011) and (Zhang et al., 2012), for our bilingual task.",
        "We suspect that better sentiment modeling may further improve the general translation performance or the quality of sentiment in translation.",
        "We will discuss some directions we think interesting in the future work section.",
        "3.3 Incorporating sentiment consistency into phrase-based SMT In this paper, we focus on exploring sentiment consistency for phrase-based SMT.",
        "However, the approach might be used in other translation framework.",
        "For example, consistency may be considered in the variables used in hierarchical translation rules (Chiang, 2005).",
        "5 Note that when sentiment-annotated training data are availa-ble, merg(.)",
        "can be trained, e.g., if assuming it to be the widely-used (log-) linear form.",
        "609 We will examine the role of sentiment consistency in two ways: designing features for the translation model and using them for re-ranking.",
        "Before discussing the details of our features, we briefly recap phrase-based SMT for completeness.",
        "Given a source sentence f, the goal of statistical machine translation is to select a target language string e which maximizes the posterior probability P(e|f).",
        "In a phrase-based SMT system, the translation unit is the phrases, where a \"phrase\" is a sequence of words.",
        "Phrase-based statistical machine translation systems are usually modeled through a log-linear framework (Och and Ney, 2002) by introducing the hidden word alignment variable a (Brown et al., 1993).",

        "are typically optimized to maximize the scoring function (Och, 2003).",
        "3.4 Feature design In Section 3.2 above, we have discussed our lexicon-based approach, which leverages lexicon-based sentiment consistency.",
        "Below, we describe the specific features we designed for our experiments.",
        "For a phrase pair ( ef ~,~ ) or a sentence pair (f, e)6, we propose the following four groups of consistency features.",
        "Subjectivity The first group of features is designed to check the subjectivity of a phrase or a sentence pair (f, e).",
        "This set of features examines if the source or target side contains sentiment units.",
        "As the name suggests, these features only capture if subjectivity exists, but not if a sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.",
        "We include four binary features that are triggered in the following condi-tions?satisfaction of each condition gives the corresponding feature a value of 1 and otherwise 0. ?",
        "F1: if neither side of the pair (f, e) contains at least one sentiment unit; 6 For simplicity, we hereafter use the same notation (f, e) to represent both a phrase pair and a sentence pair, when no confusion arises.",
        "?",
        "F2: if only one side contains sentiment units; ?",
        "F3: if the source side contains sentiment units; ?",
        "F4: if the target side contains sentiment units.",
        "Sentiment polarity The second group of features check the sentiment polarity.",
        "These features are still binary; they check if the polarities of the source and target side are the same.",
        "?",
        "F5: if the two sides of the pair (f, e) have the same polarity; ?",
        "F6: if at least one side has a neutral senti-ment; ?",
        "F7: if the polarity is opposite on the two sides, i.e., one is positive and one is negative.",
        "Note that examining the polarity on each side can be regarded as a special case of applying Equation 1 above.",
        "For example, examining the positive sentiment corresponds to using an indicator function as the basis function: it takes a value of 1 if the lsv-score of a sentiment unit is positive or 0 otherwise, while the merge function is the logic OR function.",
        "The subjectivity features above can also be thought of similarly.",
        "Sentiment intensity The third group of features is designed to capture the degree of sentiment and these features are numerical.",
        "We designed two types of features in this group.",
        "Feature F8 measures the difference of the LSV scores on the two sides.",
        "As shown in Equation (3), we use a mean function7 as our merge function when computing the lsv-scores with Equation (1), where the basis function is simply the identity function.",

        "It corresponds to a special form of Equation 1, in which the basis function is an indicator function as discussed above, and the merge function adds up all the counts and normalizes the sum by the length of the phrase or the sentence concerned.",
        "Similarly, lsv-(.)",
        "calculates the ratio of negative units and lsv+-(.)",
        "calculates that for both types of units.",
        "The length of sentence here means the number of word tokens.",
        "We experimented with and without removing stop words when counting them, and found that decision has little impact on the performance.",
        "We also used the part-of-speech (POS) information in the sentiment lexicons to help decide if a word is a sentiment word or not, when we extract features; i.e., a word is considered to have sentiment only if its POS tag also matches what is specified in the lexicons8.",
        "Using POS tags, however, did not improve our translation performance.",
        "Negation The fourth group of features checks the consistency of negation words on the source and target side.",
        "Note that negation words have already been considered in computing the lsv-scores of sentiment units.",
        "One motivation is that a negation word may appear far from the sentiment word it modifies, as mentioned in (Taboada et al., 2011) and may be outside the window we used to calculate the lsv-score above.",
        "The features here additionally check the counts of negation words.",
