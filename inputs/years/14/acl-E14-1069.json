        "This domain has the advantage that while its range of topics can be broad, the roles of participants are relatively well-defined.",
        "Courtroom dialogues also contain a specialized speech act: the objection.",
        "In real court settings (as opposed to fictionalized courts), an objection is a decision made by the party opposing the side holding the floor, to interrupt the flow of the courtroom discussion.",
        "While motivation behind taking this decision can stem from different reasons, it is typically an indication that a particular pragmatic rule has been broken.",
        "The key insight is that objections are sustained when a nuanced rule of court is being violated: for instance, the argumentative objection is ?raised in response to a question which prompts a witness to draw inferences from facts of the case?",
        "1 , as opposed to the witness stating concrete facts.",
        "The objectionable aspects of the preceding dialogue can be identified by a well-trained person; however these aspects are quite subtle to a computational model.",
        "In this work we take a first step toward addressing this problem computationally, and focus on identifying the key properties of dialogue interactions relevant for learning to identify and classify courtroom objections.",
        "Our technical goal is to drive latent learning of dialogue structure based on a combination of raw input and pragmatic binary supervision.",
        "The binary supervision we use is derived from objection speech acts appearing in the dialogue (described in Section 2.1).",
        "We are primarily interested in constructing a representation suitable for learning the challenging task of identifying objections in courtroom proceedings (Figure 1 provides an example).",

        "The first, an array of linguistic resources, which provides us an indication of structure, topics of controversy, and the sentiment and tone of language used in the dialogue.",

        "Expressions of subjectivity and sentiment are useful linguistic tools for changing the tone of the dialogue and are likely to attract opposition.",
        "We use several resources to capture this information.",
        "We use a lexicon of subjective and positive/negative sentiment expressions (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003).",
        "This resource can help identify subjective statements attempting to bias the discussion (e.g., ?So he was driving neg-ligently??)",
        "We use a list of hedges and boosters (Hyland, 2005).",
        "This resource can potentially allow the model to identify evasive (?I might have seen him?)",
        "and (overly) confident responses (?I am absolutely sure that I have seen him?).",
        "We use a lexicon of biased language provided by (Recasens et al., 2013), this lexicon extracted from Wikipedia edits consists of words indicative of bias, for example in an attempt to frame the facts raised in the discussion according to one of the viewpoints (?The death of Nicolle Simposon?",
        "vs. ?The murder of Nicolle Simposon?).",
        "Finally we use a Patient Polarity Verbs lexicon (Goyal et al., 2010).",
        "This lexicon consists 657 of verbs in which the agent performs an action with a positive (?He donated money to the foun-dation?)",
        "or negative (?He stole money from the foundation?)",
        "consequence to the patient.",
        "(3) Sentence Segmentation Many turns discuss multiple topics, some more relevant than others.",
        "In order to accommodate a finer-grained analysis, we segment each turn into its sentences.",
        "Each sentence is associated with a label, taken from a small set of generic labels.",
        "Labels include FORMALITY (e.g., a witness being sworn in), QUESTION, RESPONSE (which could be either POSITIVE or NEGATIVE) and a general STATEMENT 3 .",
        "Capturing Pragmatic Effects We observe that in the context of a courtroom discussion, utterance interpretation (and subsequent dialogue actions) is conditioned to a large extent on the speaker's motivation and goals rather than in isolation.",
        "We capture this information by explicitly associating relevant characteristics of the speakers involved in the dialogue with their utterances.",
        "We use the list of actors which appear in the trial transcripts, and associate each turn with a speaker, their role in the trial and the side they represent.",

        "2.3.4).",

        "Since this information is not pre-annotated, we allow it to be learned as latent variables.",
        "These latent variables act as boolean indicator variables, which determine how each dialogue input example will be represented.",
        "This process consists of two conceptual stages, corresponding to two types of boolean variables: (1) relevant utterances are identified; (2) meaningful connections between them, across dialogue turns, are identified.",
        "This information is exemplified as 1 and 2 in Figure 1.",
        "These decisions are taken jointly by formalizing this process as an optimization problem over the space of possible binary relations between dialogue turns and sentences.",

        "The algorithm solves this non-convex optimization function iteratively, decreasing the value of the objective in each iteration until convergence.",
        "In each iteration, the algorithm determines the values of the latent variables of positive examples, and optimizes the modified objective function using a cutting plane algorithm.",

        "We randomly select 20% as test data.",
        "We refer to this dataset as ALLOBJ.",
        "In addition, to examine the different properties of sustained and overruled objections we create two additional dataset, consisting only of sustained/overruled objections and negative examples.",

        "Objections by Type Our final dataset breaks the objections down by type.",
        "Unfortunately, most objections are not raised with an explanation of their type.",
        "We therefore can only use subsets of the larger ALLOBJ dataset.",

        "Table 2 summarizes the results obtained by the different variations of our systems over these datasets.",
        "The most striking observation emerging from these results is the combined contribution of capturing relevant dialogue content and interaction (using latent variables), combined with pragmatic information.",
        "For example in the ALLOBJ, when used in conjunction, their joint contribution pushed performance to 69.1 accuracy, a considerable improvement over using each one in isolation 65.1 for the deterministic system using pragmatic infor-mation, and 65.4 of the latent-variable formulation which does not use this information.",
        "These results are consistent in all of our experiments.",
        "We also observe that sustained objections are easier to predict than overruled objections.",
        "This is not surprising since objections raised for unjustified reasons are harder to detect.",
        "Pragmatic Considerations Pragmatic information in our system is modeled by using the x Sit representation, which conditions all decisions on the speaker identity and role.",
        "The results in Table 2 show that this information typically results in better quality predictions.",
        "An interesting side effect of using pragmatic information is its impact on the dialogue structure predictions learned as latent variables during learning.",
        "We can quantify the effect by looking at the number of latent variables activated for each model.",
        "When pragmatic information is used, 5.6 relevance variables are used on average (per dialogue snipped).",
        "In contrast, when pragmatic information is not used, this number rises to 6.3 8 .",
        "In addition, the average number of sentence-connection variables active when pragmatic information is used is 3.44.",
        "This number drops to 2.53 when it is not.",
        "These scores suggest that information about the dialogue pragmatics allows the model to take advantage of the dialogue structure at the level of the latent information, focusing the learner of higher level information, such as the relation between turns, and less on low level, lexical information.",
        "The effect of using the pragmatic information can be observed qualitatively as exemplified in Figure 2, where the latent decisions, when pragmatic information is available, construct a more topically centered representation of the dialogue for the classification decision.",
        "Typed Objections The results over the different objection types are summarized in Table 3.",
        "These results provide some intuition on which of the objection types are harder to predict, and the contribution of each aspect of our system for that objection type.",
        "9 We can see that across the objection types, using latent variables modeling typically results in a considerable improvement in performance.",
        "The most striking example of the importance of using pragmatic information is the LACK OF FOUNDATION objection type.",
        "This objection definition as ?the evidence lacks testimony as to its authenticity or source.?",

        "We adopted the structured latent variable model defined in (Chang et al., 2010), and use ILP to solve the structure prediction inference problem (Roth and Yih, 2007).",
        "Our prediction task, identifying the actionable result of a dialogue, requires capturing the dialogue and discourse relations.",
        "While we view these relations as latent variables in the context of action prediction, studying these relations independently has been the focus of significant research efforts, such as discourse relations (Prasad et al., 2008), rhetorical structure (Marcu, 1997) and dialogue act modeling (Stolcke et al., 2000).",
        "Fully supervised approaches for learning to predict dialogue and discourse relations (such as (Baldridge and Lascarides, 2005)) typically requires heavy supervision and has been applied only to limited domains.",
        "Moving away from full supervision, the work of (Golland et al., 2010) uses a game-theoretic model to explicitly model the roles of dialogue participants.",
        "In the context of dialogue and situated language understanding, the work of (Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2011) shows how to derive supervision for dialogue processing from its structure.",
        "Discriminative latent variables models have seen a surge of interest in recent years, both in the machine learning community (Yu and Joachims, 2009; Quattoni et al., 2007) as well as various application domains such as NLP (T?ackstr?om and McDonald, 2011) and computer vision (Felzen- szwalb et al., 2010).",
        "In NLP, one of the most well-known applications of discriminative latent structured classification is to the Textual Entailment (TE) task (Chang et al., 2010; Wang and Manning, 2010).",
        "The TE task bears some resemblances ours, as both tasks require making a binary decision on the basis of a complex input object (i.e., the history of dialogue, pairs of paragraphs), creating the need for a learning framework that is flexible enough to model the complex latent structure that exists in the input.",
        "Another popular application domain is sentiment analysis (Yessenalina et al., 2010; T?ackstr?om and McDonald, 2011; Trivedi and Eisenstein, 2013).",
        "The latent variable model allows the learner to identify finer grained sentiment expression than annotated in the data.",
        "A related area of work with different motivations and different technical approaches has focused on attempting to understand narrative structure.",
        "For instance, Chambers and Jurafsky (Cham- bers and Jurafsky, 2008; Chambers and Juraf-sky, 2009) model narrative flow in the style of Schankian scripts (Schank and Abelson, 1977).",
        "Their focus is on common sequences of actions, not specifically related to dialogue.",
        "Somewhat more related is recent work (Goyal et al., 2010) that aimed to build a computational model of Lehnert's Plot Units (Lehnert, 1981) model.",
        "That work focused primarily on actions and not on di-alogue: in fact, their results showed that the lack of dialogue understanding was a significant detriment to their ability to model plot structure.",
        "Instead of focusing on actions, like the above work, we focus on dialogue content and relationships between utterances.",
