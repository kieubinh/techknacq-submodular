        "First, we estimate a mapping function between the linguistic features of a corpus of utterances and their human style ratings.",
        "Users are partitioned into clusters based on the similarity of their ratings, so that ratings for new utterances can be estimated, even for new, unknown users.",
        "In a second step, the estimated model is used to re-rank the outputs of a number of surface realisers to produce stylistically adaptive output.",
        "Results confirm that the generated styles are recognisable to human judges and that predictive models based on clusters of users lead to better rating predictions than models based on an average population of users."

        "Stylistic surface realisation aims not only to find the best realisation candidate for a semantic input based on some underlying trained model, but also aims to adapt its output to properties of the user, such as their age, social group, or location, among others.",
        "One of the first systems to address stylistic variation in generation was Hovy (1988)'s PAULINE, which generated texts that reflect different speaker attitudes towards events based on multiple, adjustable features.",
        "Stylistic variation in such contexts can often be modelled systematically as a multidimensional variation space with several continuous dimensions, so that varying stylistic scores indicate the strength of each dimension in a realisation candidate.",
        "Here, we focus on the dimensions of colloquialism, politeness and naturalness.",
        "Assuming a target score on one or more dimensions, candidate outputs of a data-driven realiser can then be ranked according to their predicted affinity with the target scores.",
        "In this paper, we aim for an approach to stylistic surface realisation which is on the one hand based on natural human data so as to reflect stylistic variation that is as natural as possible.",
        "On the other hand, we aim to minimise the amount of annotation and human engineering that informs the design of the system.",
        "To this end, we estimate a mapping function between automatically identifiable shallow linguistic features characteristic of an utterance and its human-assigned style ratings.",
        "In addition, we aim to address the high degree of variability that is often encountered in subjective rating studies, such as assessments of recommender systems (O?Mahony et al., 2006; Amatriain et al., 2009), sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2005), or surface realisations, where user ratings have been shown to differ significantly (p<0.001) for the same utterance (Walker et al., 2007).",
        "Such high variability can affect the performance of systems which are trained from an average population of user ratings.",
        "However, we are not aware of any work that has addressed this problem principally by estimating ratings for both known users, for whom ratings exists, and unknown users, for whom no prior ratings exist.",
        "To achieve this, we propose to partition users into clusters of individuals who assign similar ratings to linguistically similar utterances, so that their ratings can be estimated more accurately than 702 based on an average population of users.",
        "This is similar to Janarthanam and Lemon (2014), who show that clustering users and adapting to their level of domain expertise can significantly improve task success and user ratings.",
        "Our resulting model is evaluated with realisers not originally built to deal with stylistic variation, and produces natural variation recognisable by humans.",
        "2 Architecture and Domain We aim to with generating restaurant recommendations as part of an interactive system.",
        "To do this, we assume that a generator input is provided by a preceding module, e.g. the interaction man-ager, and that the task of the surface realiser is to find a suitable stylistically appropriate realisation.",
        "An example input is inform(food=Italian, name=Roma), which could be expressed as The restaurant Roma serves Italian food.",
        "A further aspect is that users are initially unknown to the system, but that it should adapt to them over time by discovering their stylistic preferences.",
        "Future work involves integrating the surface realiser into the PARLANCE1 (Hastie et al., 2013) spoken dialogue system with a method for triggering the different styles.",
        "Here, we leave the question of when different styles are appropriate as future work and focus on being able to generate them.",
        "The architecture of our model is shown in Figure 1.",
        "Training of the regression model from stylistically-rated human corpora is shown in the top-left box (grey).",
        "Utterance ratings from human judges are used to extract shallow linguistic features as well as to estimate user clusters.",
        "Both types of information inform the resulting stylistic regression model.",
        "For surface realisation (top- right box, blue), a semantic input from a preceding model is given as input to a surface realiser.",
        "Any realiser is suitable that returns a ranked list of output candidates.",
        "The resulting list is re-ranked according to stylistic scores estimated by the re-gressor, so that the utterance which most closely reflects the target score is ranked highest.",
        "The re-ranking process is shown in the lower box (red).",
        "3 Related Work 3.1 Stylistic Variation in Surface Realisation Our approach is most closely related to work by Paiva and Evans (2005) and Mairesse and Walker 1http://parlance-project.eu User Clusters Regressor Surface Realisation Ranking + Evaluation Figure 1: Architecture of stylistic realisation model.",
        "Top left: user clusters are estimated from corpus utterances described by linguistic features and ratings.",
        "Top right: surface realisation ranks a list of output candidates based on a semantic input.",
        "These are ranked stylistically given a trained regressor.",
        "(2011), discussed in turn here.",
        "Paiva and Evans (2005) present an approach that uses multivariate linear regression to map individual linguistic features to distinguishable styles of text.",
        "The approach works in three steps.",
        "First, a factor analysis is used to determine the relevant stylistic dimensions from a corpus of human text using shallow linguistic features.",
        "Second, a hand-crafted generator is used to produce a large set of ut-terances, keeping traces of each generator deci-sion, and obtaining style scores for each output based on the estimated factor model.",
        "The result is a dataset of <generator decision, style score> pairs which can be used in a correlation analysis to identify the predictors of particular output styles.",
        "During generation, the correlation equations inform the generator at each choice point so as to best express the desired style.",
        "Unfortunately, no human evaluation of the model is presented so that it remains unclear to what extent the generated styles are perceivable by humans.",
        "Closely related is work by Mairesse and Walker (2011) who present the PERSONAGE system, which aims to generate language reflecting particular personalities.",
        "Instead of choosing generator decisions by considering their predicted style scores, however, Mairesse and Walker (2011) directly predict generator decisions based on target personality scores.",
        "To obtain the generator, the authors first generate a corpus of utterances which differ randomly in their linguistic choices.",
        "All utterances are rated by humans indicating the 703 extent to which they reflect different personality traits.",
        "The best predictive model is then chosen in a comparison of several classifiers and regressors.",
        "Mairesse and Walker (2011) are the first to evaluate their generator with humans and show that the generated personalities are indeed recognisable.",
        "Approaches on replicating personalities in realisations include Gill and Oberlander (2002) and Isard et al. (2006).",
        "Porayska-Pomsta and Mellish (2004) and Gupta et al. (2007) are approaches to politeness in generation, based on the notion of face and politeness theory, respectively.",
        "3.2 User Preferences in Surface Realisation Taking users?",
        "individual content preferences into account for training generation systems can positively affect their performance (Jordan and Walker, 2005; Dale and Viethen, 2009).",
        "We are interested in individual user perceptions concerning the surface realisation of system output and the way they relate to different stylistic dimensions.",
        "Walker et al. (2007) were the first to show that individual preferences exist for the perceived quality of realisations and that these can be modelled in trainable generation.",
        "They train two versions of a rank-and-boost generator, a first version of which is trained on the average population of user ratings, whereas a second one is trained on the ratings of individual users.",
        "The authors show statistically that ratings from different users are drawn from different distributions (p<0.001) and that significantly better performance is achieved when training and testing on data of individual users.",
        "In fact, training a model on one user's ratings and testing it on another's performs as badly as a random baseline.",
        "However, no previous work has modelled the individual preferences of unseen users -- for whom no training data exists.",
        "4 Estimation of Style Prediction Models 4.1 Corpora and Style Dimensions Our domain of interest is the automatic generation of restaurant recommendations that differ with respect to their colloquialism and politeness and are as natural as possible.",

        "From this, we can see that LIST utterances were perceived as the least natural and 2http://www.list.co.uk/ 3http://people.csail.mit.edu/francois/ research/bagel/ 4http://www.classic-project.org/ 5http://crowdflower.com/ 704 colloquial, but as the most polite.",
        "CLASSIC utterances were perceived as the most colloquial, but the least polite, and MAI utterances were rated as the most natural.",
        "Differences between ratings for each dimension and dataset are significant at p<0.01, using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, except the naturalness for MAI and CLASSIC.",
        "Since we are mainly interested in the lexical and syntactic features of utterances here, the fact that CLASSIC utterances are spoken, whereas the other two corpora are written, should not affect the quality of the resulting model.",
        "Similarly, some stylistic categories may seem closely related, such as colloquialism and naturalness, or orthogonal to each other, such as politeness and colloquialism.",
        "However, while ratings for colloquialism and naturalness are very close for the CLASSIC dataset, they vary significantly for the two other datasets (p<0.01).",
        "Also, the ratings for colloqui-alim and politeness show a weak positive correlation of 0.23, i.e. are not perceived as orthogonal by users.",
        "These results suggest that all in all our three stylistic categories are perceived as sufficiently different from each other and suitable for training to predict a spectrum of different styles.",

        "The only analysis tool we used was the Stanford Parser,6 which identified certain types of words (pronouns, wh-words) or the depth of syntactic embedding.",
        "A step-wise regression analysis was then carried out to identify those features that contributed significantly (at p<0.01) to the overall regression equation obtained per stylistic dimension.",

        "4.3 Regression Experiments Based on the features identified in Section 4.2, we train a separate regressor for each stylistic dimension.",
        "The task of the regressor is to predict, based on the extracted linguistic features of an utterance, a score in the range of 1-5 for colloquialism, politeness and naturalness.",
        "We compare: (1) a multivariate multiple regressor (MMR), (2) an M5P decision tree regressor, (3) a support vector machine (SVM) with linear kernel, and (4) a ZeroR classifier, which serves as a majority baseline.",
        "We used the R statistics toolkit7 for the MMR and the Weka toolkit8 for the remaining models.",
        "Average User Ratings The regressors were first trained to predict the average user ratings of an utterance and evaluated in a 10-fold cross validation experiment.",
        "Table 3 shows the results.",
        "Here, r denotes the Pearson correlation coefficient, which indicates the correlation between the predicted and the actual user scores; R2 is the coefficient of determination, which provides a measure of how well the learnt model fits the data; and RMSE refers to the Root Mean Squared Error, the error between the predicted and actual user ratings.",
        "We can observe that MMR achieves the best performance for predicting colloquialism and nat-uralness, whereas M5P best predicts politeness.",
        "Unfortunately, all regressors achieve at best a moderate correlation with human ratings.",
        "Based on these results, we ran a correlation analysis for all utterances for which more than 20 original user ratings were available.",

        "Yeh and Mellish (1997) report only 70% agreement of human judges on the best choice of referring expression.",
        "Amatriain et al. (2009) report inconsistencies in user ratings in recommender systems with an RMSE range of 0.55 to 0.81 and argue that this constitutes a lower bound for system performance.",
        "This inconsistency is exacerbated by raters recruited via crowdsourcing platforms as in our study (Koller et al., 2010; Rieser et al., 2011).",
        "However, while crowdsourced data have been shown to contain substantially more noise than data collected in a lab environment, they do tend to reflect the general tendency of their more controlled counterparts (Gosling et al., 2004).",
        "Individual User Ratings Given that individual preferences exist for surface realisation (Walker et al., 2007), we included the user's ID as a regression feature and re-ran the experiments.",
        "The hypothesis was that if users differ in their preferences for realisation candidates, they may also differ in terms of their perceptions of linguistic styles.",
        "The results shown in Table 4 support this: the obtained correlations are significantly higher (p<0.001, using the Fisher r-to-z transformation) than those without the user's ID (though we are still not able to model the full variation observed in ratings).",
        "Importantly, this shows that user ratings are intrinsically coherent (not random) and that variation exists mainly for inter-user agreement.",
        "This model performs satisfactorily for a known population of users.",
        "However, it does not allow the prediction of ratings of unknown users, who we mostly encounter in generation.",
        "5 Clustering User Rating Behaviour 5.1 Spectral Clustering The goal of this section is to find a number of k clusters which partition our data set of user ratings in a way that users in one cluster rate utterances with particular linguistic properties most similarly to each other, while rating them most dissimilarly to users in other clusters.",

        "We can see that the baseline without user information is outperformed with as few as three clusters.",
        "From 30 clusters on, a medium correlation is obtained until another performance jump occurs around 90 clusters.",
        "Evidently, the best performance would be achieved by obtaining one cluster per user, i.e. 167 clusters, but nothing would be gained in this way, and we can see that useful generalisations can be made from much fewer clusters.",
        "Based on the clusters found, we will now predict the ratings of known and unknown users.",
        "Known Users For known users, first of all, Figure 3 shows the correlations between the predicted and actual ratings for colloquialism, politeness and naturalness based on 90 user clusters.",
        "Correlation coefficients were obtained using an MMR regressor.",
        "We can see that a medium correlation is achieved for naturalness and (nearly) strong correlations are achieved for politeness and colloquialism.",
        "This confirms that clustering users can help to better predict their ratings than based on shallow linguistic features alone, but that more generalisation is achieved than based on individual user ratings that include the user's ID as a regression feature.",
        "The performance gain in comparison to predicting average ratings is significant (p<0.01) from as few as three clusters onwards.",
        "Unknown Users We initially sort unknown users into the majority cluster and then aim to make more accurate cluster allocations as more information becomes available.",
        "For example, after a user has assigned their first rating, we can take it into account to re-estimate their cluster more accurately.",
        "Clusters are re-estimated with each new rating, based on our trained regression model.",
