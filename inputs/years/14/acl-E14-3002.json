        "Knowledge acquisition from written or spoken text is a field of interest not only for theoretical reasons but also for practical applications, such as semantic search, question answering and knowledge management, just to name a few.",
        "In this work, we propose an approach for unsupervised relation extraction (URE) where we make use of the Distributional Hypothesis by Harris (1954).",
        "The underlying data set is collected from the world wide web by focusing on web documents that are from the same domain as a small initialization data set that is provided beforehand.",
        "We hereby enrich this existing, domain-defining, corpus with more data of the same kind.",
        "This is needed for practical reasons when working with the Distributional Hypothesis (Harris, 1954): A lot of data is required for plausible outcomes and an appropriate coverage.",
        "However, we want as little irrelevant data as possible.",
        "The proposal's contribution is thus twofold: a) focused crawling, and b) unsupervised relation extraction.",
        "As a particular use case, we are especially interested in scientific publications from the German educational domain.",
        "However, we would like to point out that the methodology itself is independent of language and domain and is generally applicable to any domain.",
        "This work is structured as follows: First we will motivate our combined approach and introduce each part individually.",
        "We then present related work in Section 2.",
        "Section 3 explains the methodology of both parts, and in Section 4 we outline the evaluation procedure of each of the components individually.",
        "This is followed by some preliminary results in Section 5, and Section 6 concludes this proposal with some prospects for future work.",
        "1.1 Motivation The identification of relations between entities solely from text is one of many challenges in the development of language understanding system (Carlson et al., 2010; Etzioni et al., 2008); and yet it is the one step with the highest information gain.",
        "It is used e.g. for taxonomy induction (Hearst, 1992) or ontology accumulation (Mintz et al., 2009) or even for identifying facts that express general knowledge and that often recur (Cham- bers and Jurafsky, 2011).",
        "Davidov et al. (2007) performed unsupervised relation extraction by actively mining the web and showed major improve-11 ments in the detection of new facts from only little initial seed.",
        "They used a major web search engine as a vital component of their system.",
        "According to Kilgarriff (2007), however, this strategy is unreliable and should be avoided.",
        "Nevertheless, the web is undeniably the largest source for any kind of data, and we feel the need for developing easy-to-use components that make it possible to create corpora from the web with only little effort (cf. e.g. Biemann et al. (2013)).",
        "When it comes to specific in-domain information, the complete world wide web is first of all too vast to be processed conve-niently, and second the gain is little because of too much irrelevant information.",
        "Thus we need methods for reducing the size of data to process without losing the focus on the important information and without using web search engines.",
        "The combination of a focused crawling system with a subsequent unsupervised relation extraction system enables the acquisition of richer in-domain knowledge than just relying on little local data, but without having to process petabytes of data and still not relying of web search.",
        "And yet, by using the web as a resource, our system is generally applicable and independent of language and target domain.",
        "1.2 Focused Crawling The first part of this proposal is concerned with the efficient discovery of publications in the web for a particular domain.",
        "The domain definition is given as a limited number of reference documents.",
        "An extra challenge is, that non-negligible amounts of scientific publications are only available as pdf documents, which makes the necessity of new focused crawling techniques even more important.",
        "This holds especially for our target use case, the German educational domain.",
        "In Section 2.1 we will discuss this issue in more detail.",
        "We develop a focused web crawling system which collects primarily relevant documents and ignores irrelevant documents and which is particularly suited for harvesting documents from a predefined specific domain.",
        "1.3 Unsupervised Relation Extraction The second part of this proposal is the semantic structuring of texts ?",
        "in our particular use case scientific publications from the educational domain ?",
        "by using data-driven techniques of computational semantics.",
        "The resulting structure enables forms of post-processing like inference or reasoning.",
        "In the semantic structuring part, the overall goal is to discover knowledge which can then be used in further steps.",
        "Specifically, we will focus on unsupervised relation extraction.",
        "2 Related Work 2.1 Focused Crawling The development of high-quality data-driven semantic models relies on corpora of large sizes (Banko and Brill, 2001; Halevy et al., 2009), and the world wide web is by far the biggest available source of textual data.",
        "Nowadays, a large number of research projects rely on corpora that comes from data in the world wide web.",
        "The Web-as-Corpus Kool Yinitiative 1 (WaCKy) (Baroni et al., 2009) for example produced one of the largest corpora used in linguistic research which comes from web documents.",
        "Another research initiative which produces a variety of corpora by crawling the web is the COW 2 (corpora from the web) project (Sch?afer and Bildhauer, 2012).",
        "Currently one of the largest N-gram corpora coming from web data is the Google V1 and Google V2 (Lin et al., 2010), which are used e.g. for improving noun phrase parsing (Pitler et al., 2010).",
        "Also the predecessor Google Web1T (Brants and Franz, 2006), which is computed from 1 Trillion words from the web, is heavily used in the community.",
        "All these corpora are generated from general texts which either come from crawling specific top-level-domains (tlds) or preprocessing and filtering very large amounts of texts for a specified language.",
        "Additionally, we are not aware of any corpus that is created by collecting pdf documents.",
        "This is especially an issue when aiming at a corpus of scientific publications, such as e.g. the ACL anthology 3 (Bird et al., 2008).",
        "As of today, electronic publications are primarily distributed as pdf documents.",
        "Usually these are omitted by the particular crawler because of a number of practical issues, e.g. difficulties in extracting clean plain-text.",
        "Further, we are not interested in sheer collection size, but also in domain specificity.",
        "Crawling is a time-consuming process and it comes with logistic challenges for processing the resulting data.",
        "While standard breadth-first or depth-first crawling strategies can be adjusted to include pdf files, we want to avoid to harvest the huge bulk of data 1 http://wacky.sslmit.unibo.it/ 2 http://hpsg.fu-berlin.de/cow/ 3 http://acl-arc.comp.nus.edu.sg/ 12 that we are not interested in, namely those documents that are of a different topical domain as our initial domain definition.",
        "In focused crawling, which is sometimes also referred to as topical crawling, web crawlers are designed to harvest those parts of the web first that are more interesting for a particular topic (Chakrabarti et al., 1999).",
        "By doing so, task-specific corpora can be generated fast and efficient.",
        "Typical focused crawlers use machine learning techniques or heuristics to prioritize newly discovered URIs (unified resource iden-tifier) for further crawling (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Chakrabarti et al., 1999; Menczer et al., 2004).",
        "In our scenario however, we do not rely on positively and negatively labeled data.",
        "The source documents that serve as the domain definition are assumed to be given in plain text.",
        "The development of tools that are able to generate in-domain web-corpora from focused crawls is the premise for further generating rich semantic models tailored to a target domain.",
        "2.2 Unsupervised Relation Extraction The unsupervised relation extraction (URE) part of this proposal is specifically focused on extracting relations between nominals.",
        "Typically the choice of the entity type depends merely on the final task at hand.",
        "Kinds of entities which are usually considered in relation extraction are named entities like persons or organizations.",
        "However, we will focus on nominals which are much more general and also include named entities since they are basically nouns or noun phrases (Nastase et al., 2013).",
        "Nominals are discussed in more detail in Section 3.2.",
        "Unsupervised methods for relation extraction is a particularly interesting area of research because of its applicability across languages without relying on labeled data.",
        "In contrast to open information extraction, in unsupervised relation extraction the collected relations are aggregated in order to identify the most promising relations for expressing interesting facts.",
        "Here, the grouping is made explicit for further processing.",
        "One possible application of relation extraction is the establishment of so-called knowledge graphs (Sowa, 2000), which encode facts that manifest solely from text.",
        "The knowledge graph can then be used e.g. for reasoning, that is finding new facts from existing facts.",
        "Many approaches exist for acquiring knowledge from text.",
        "Hearst (1992) first discovered that relations between entities occur in a handful of well developed text patterns.",
        "For example ?X is a Y?",
        "or ?X and other Ys?",
        "manifest themselves as hy-ponymic relations.",
        "However, not every kind of relation is as easy to identify as those ?is-a?",
        "relations.",
        "Often semantic relations cannot be expressed by any pattern.",
        "A variety of methods were developed that automatically find new patterns and entities with or without supervision.",
        "These methods reach from bootstrapping methods (Hearst, 1992) over distant supervision (Mintz et al., 2009) and latent relational analysis (LRA) (Turney, 2005) to extreme unsupervised relation extraction (Davi- dov and Rappoport, 2008a), just to name a few.",
        "The importance of unsupervised methods for relation extraction is obvious: The manual creation of knowledge resources is time consuming and expensive in terms of manpower.",
        "Though manual resources are typically very precise they are almost always lacking of lexical and relational coverage.",
        "The extraction of relations between entities is a crucial process which is performed by every modern language understanding system like NELL 4 (Carlson et al., 2010) or machine reading 5 , which evolved among others from TextRunner 6 (Etzioni et al., 2008).",
        "The identification of relations in natural language texts is at the heart of such systems.",
        "3 Methodology 3.1 Focused Crawling Language models (LMs) are a rather old but well understood and generally accepted concept in Computational Linguistics and Information Retrieval.",
        "Our focused crawling strategy builds upon the idea of utilizing a language model to discriminate between relevant and irrelevant web documents.",
        "The key idea of this methodology is that web pages which come from a certain domain ?",
        "which implies the use of a particular vocabulary (Biber, 1995) ?",
        "link to other documents of the same domain.",
        "The assumption is that the crawler will most likely stay in the same topical domain as the initial language model was generated from.",
        "Thus the crawling process can be terminated when enough data has been collected.",
        "4 Never Ending Language Learner: http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/ 5 http://ai.cs.washington.edu/ projects/open-information-extraction 6 http://openie.cs.washington.edu/ 13 A language model is a statistical model over short sequences of consecutive tokens called N-grams.",
        "The order of a language model is defined by the length of such sequences, i.e. the ?N?",
        "in N-gram.",
        "The probability of a sequence of m words, that could be for example a sentence, is computed as: p(w 1 , ..., w m ) ?",
        "m ?",
        "i=1 p(w i |w i?N+1:i?1 ) , (1) where N is the order of the language model and p(w i |w i?n+1:i?1 ) is the probability of the particular N-gram.",
        "In the simplest case the probability of an N-gram is computed as: p(w i |w i?n+1:i?1 ) = count(w i?N+1:i ) count(w i?N+1:i?1 ) , (2) where count(N-gram) is a function that takes as argument an N-gram of length N or an N-gram of length N ?",
        "1 and returns the frequency of observations in the source corpus.",
        "This model has some obvious limitations when it comes to out-of-vocabulary (OOV) terms because of probabilities being zero.",
        "Due to this limitation, a number of LMs were proposed which handle OOV terms well.",
        "One of the most advanced language models is the Kneser-Ney language model (Kneser and Ney, 1995), which applies an advanced interpolation technique for OOV issues.",
        "According to Halevy et al. (2009), simpler models that are trained on large amounts of data often outperform complex models with training procedures that are feasible only for small data.",
        "Anyway, we have only little data in the initial phase, thus we use Kneser and Ney's model.",
        "Perplexity is used to measure the amount of compatibility with another model X: Perplexity(X) = 2 H(X) , (3) where H(X) = ?",
        "1 |X| ?",
        "x?X log 2 p(x) is the cross entropy of a model X .",
        "Using perplexity we are able to tell how well the language model fits the data and vice versa.",
        "The key idea is that documents which come from a certain register or domain ?",
        "which implies the use of a particular vocabulary (Biber, 1995) ?",
        "link to other documents of the same register.",
        "Using perplexity, we are able to rank outgoing links by their deviation from our initial language model.",
        "Hence weblinks that are extracted from a highly deviating webpage are less prioritized for harvesting.",
        "The open source crawler software Heritrix 7 (Mohr et al., 2004) forms the basis of our focused crawling strategy, since it provides a well-established framework which is easily extensible through its modularity.",
        "3.2 Identification of Nominals Nominals are defined to be expressions which syntactically act like nouns or noun phrases (Quirk et al., 1985, p.335).",
        "Another definition according to Nastase et al. (2013) is that nominals are defined to be in one of the following classes: a) common nouns, b) proper nouns, c) multi-word proper nouns, d) deverbal nouns, e) deadjectival nouns, or f) non-compositional (adjective) noun phrases.",
        "In this work we will follow the definition given by Nastase et al. (2013).",
        "We will further address only relations that are at least realized by verbal or prepositional phrases and ignore relations that are implicitly present in compounds, which is a task of its own, cf. (Holz and Biemann, 2008).",
        "Note however we do not ignore relations between com-pounds, but within compounds.",
        "The identification of nominals can be seen as the task of identifying reliable multi-word-expressions (MWEs), which is a research question of its own right.",
        "As a first simplified approach we only consider nouns and heads of noun compounds to be representatives for nominals.",
        "E.g. a compound is used as an entity, but only the head is taken into further consideration as a representative since it encapsulates the main meaning for that phrase.",
        "3.3 Unsupervised Relation Extraction Our system is founded in the idea of distributional semantics on the level of dependency parses.",
        "The Distributional Hypothesis by Harris (1954) (cf. also (Miller and Charles, 1991)) states that words which tend to occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings.",
        "This implies that one can estimate the meaning of an unknown word by considering the context in that it occurs.",
        "Lin and Pantel (2001) extended this hypothesis to cover shortest paths in the dependency graph ?",
        "so-called dependency paths ?",
        "and introduced the Extended Distributional Hypothesis.",
        "This extended hypothesis states that dependency paths which tend to occur in similar contexts, i.e. they connect the simi-7 http://crawler.archive.org 14 lar sets of words, also tend to have similar meanings.",
        "Sun and Grishman (2010) used an agglomerative hierarchical clustering based approach in order to group the patterns found by Lin and Pan-tel's method.",
        "The clusters are used in a semi-supervised way to extract relation instances that are used in a bootstrapping fashion to find new relations.",
        "While Sun and Grishman (2010) performed a hard clustering, meaning every relation is assigned exactly to one cluster, we argue that relations are accompanied by a certain degree of ambiguity.",
        "Think for example about the expression ?X comes from Y?",
        "which could be both, a causal relation or a locational relation depending on the meaning of X and Y.",
        "That being said, we use the Extended Distributional Hypothesis in order to extract meaningful relations from text.",
        "We follow Lin and Pantel (2001) and use the dependency path between two entities to identify both, similar entity pairs and similar dependency paths.",
        "Specifically we use the Stanford Parser 8 (Klein and Manning, 2003) to get a collapsed dependency graph representation of a sentence, and apply the JoBimText 9 (Biemann and Riedl, 2013) software for computing the distributional similarities.",
        "By using the JoBimText framework, we accept their theory, which states that dimensionality-reduced vector space models are not expressive enough to capture the full semantics of words, phrases, sentences, documents or relations.",
        "Turney and Pantel (2010) surveyed that vector space models are commonly used in computational semantics and that they are able to capture the meaning of words.",
        "However, by doing various kinds of vector space transformations, e.g. dimensionality reduction with SVD 10 important information from the long tail, i.e. items that do not occur often, is lost.",
        "Instead, Biemann and Riedl (2013) introduced the scalable JoBimText framework, which makes use of the Distributional Hypothesis.",
        "We take this as a starting point to steer away from the use of vector space models.",
        "For each entity pair ?X::Y?, where ?X?",
        "and ?Y?",
        "are nominals, we collect all dependency paths that 8 http://nlp.stanford.edu/downloads/ lex-parser.shtml 9 http://sf.net/p/jobimtext 10 Singular Value Decomposition, used for example in latent semantic analysis, latent relational analysis, principal component analysis and many more.",

        "Note that this procedure strongly coheres with the methodologies proposed by Lewis and Steedman (2013) or Akbik et al. (2013).",
        "We then compute the distributional similarities for both directions: a) similarities of entity pairs by paths, and b) similarities of paths by entity pairs.",

        "Section 3.1) by creating a language model from the harvested data during a particular crawl.",
        "Perplexity is then calculated with respect to a held out test set.",

        "From the harvested data, another language model V is produced which is used for the evaluation of the test data.",
        "Here we argue that a crawl which collects data that is used for evaluating V and V results in a lower perplexity score, is preferred as it better models the target domain.",
        "Figure 2 shows a schematic overview of the three phases of evaluation.",
        "4.2 Unsupervised Relation Extraction The evaluation of relation extraction is a non-trivial task, as unsupervised categories do usually not exactly match the distinctions taken in annotation studies.",
        "For the evaluation of our method we consider the following three approaches: 1.",
        "We test our relations directly on datasets that were provided as relation classification challenge datasets (Girju et al., 2007; Hendrickx 13 independent and identically distributed U V w w w Phase 1 Phase 3 Phase 2 Figure 2: Schematic overview of the evaluation procedure for a particular crawl.",
        "et al., 2010).",
        "Whereas the first dataset is provided as a binary classification task, the second is a multi-way classification task.",
        "How-ever, both datasets can be transformed to address the one or the other task.",
        "This is possible because the challenge is already finished.",
        "2.",
        "We apply our extracted relations for assisting classification algorithms for the task of textual entailment (Dagan et al., 2006).",
        "3.",
        "Following Davidov and Rappoport (2008b) we would further like to apply our system to the task of question answering.",
        "While the first approach is an intrinsic evaluation, the other three approaches are extrinsic, i.e. the extracted relations are used in a particular task which is then evaluated against some gold standard.",
        "5 Preliminary Results 5.1 Focused crawling Table 1 shows some quantitative characteristics of a non-focused crawl.",

        "Initial encouraging results on the comparison of a focused vs. a non-focused crawl are shown in Figure 3.",
        "The crawls were performed under the same conditions and we recorded the perplexity value during the process.",
        "We plot the history for the first 300,000 documents.",
        "Although these results are preliminary, a trend is clearly observable.",
        "The focused crawl harvests more relevant documents as it proceeds, whereas the non-focused crawl deviates more as longer the crawl proceeds, as indicated by higher perplexity values for later documents ?",
        "an effect that is likely to increase as the crawl proceeds.",
        "The focused crawl, on the other hand, stays within low perplexity limits.",
        "We plan to evaluate settings and the interplay between crawling parameters and language modeling more thoroughly in future evaluations.",
        "5.2 Unsupervised Relation Extraction The unsupervised extraction of relations was performed on a small subset of one Million sentences of the news corpus from the Leipzig Corpora Collection (Richter et al., 2006).",
        "Preliminary example results are shown in Table 2 and in Table 3.",

        "In Table 2, three example entity pairs are shown together with their most similar counterparts.",
        "It is interesting to see that the relation of gold to ounce is the same as stock to share or oil to barrel and we can easily agree here, since the one is the measuring unit for the other.",
        "Table 3 shows for three example prepositional paths the similar paths.",
        "We have chosen prepositional phrases here because of their intuitive in-terpretability.",
        "The example output shows that the similar phrases which were identified by the system are also interpretable for humans.",

        "6 Conclusion and Future Work This research thesis proposal addressed the two major objectives: 1. crawling with a focus on in-domain data by using a language model of an initial corpus, which is small compared to the expected result of the crawls, in order to discriminate relevant web documents from irrelevant web documents, and 2. unsupervised relation extraction by following the principles of the Distributional Hypothesis by Harris (1954) resp.",
        "the Extended Distributional Hypothesis by Lin and Pantel (2001).",
        "The promising preliminary results encourage us to examine this approach for further directions.",
        "Specifically the yet unaddressed parts of the evaluation will be investigated.",
        "Further, the unsupervised relation extraction techniques will be applied on the complete set of in-domain data, thus finalizing the workflow of enriching a small amount of domain defining data with web data 17 gold/NN :: ounce/NN crude/NN :: barrel/NN oil/NN :: barrel/NN futures/NNS :: barrel/NN stock/NN :: share/NN graduate/NN :: University/NNP graduate/NN :: School/NNP graduate/NN :: College/NNP goals/NNS :: season/NN points/NNS :: season/NN points/NNS :: game/NN touchdowns/NNS :: season/NN Table 2: Example results for selected entity pairs.",
        "Similar entity pairs with respect to the boldface pair are shown.",
        "from focused crawls in order to extract rich in-domain knowledge, particularly from the german educational domain as our application domain.",
        "While we made clear that crawling the web is a crucial process in order to get the amounts of in-domain data needed by the unsupervised relation extraction methods, we did not yet point out that we will also examine the reverse direction, i.e. the possibility to use the extracted relations for further improving the focused crawler.",
        "A focused crawler that is powered by semantic relations between entities would raise a new level of semantically focused crawls.",
        "Additionally, we will investigate possibilities for further narrowing the relations found by our system.",
        "Here it is possible to further categorize or cluster the relations by using either the similarity graph or the features itself, as done by Pantel and Lin (2002).",
