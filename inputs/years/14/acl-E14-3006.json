        "Resolving anaphoric relations automatically requires annotated data for training and testing.",
        "Anaphora and coreference resolution systems have been tested and evaluated on different genres, mainly news articles and dialogue.",
        "However, for scientific text, annotated data are scarce and coreference resolution systems are lacking (Sch?afer et al., 2012).",
        "We present a study of anaphora in scientific literature and show the difficulties that arise when resolving coreferent and associative entities in two different scientific disciplines, namely computational linguistics and genetics.",
        "Coreference resolution in scientific articles is considered difficult due to the high proportion of definite descriptions (Watson et al., 2003), which typically require domain knowledge to be resolved.",
        "The more complex nature of the texts is also reflected in the heavy use of abstract entities such as results or variables, while easy-to-resolve named entities are less frequently used.",
        "We test an existing, state-of-the-art coreference resolution tool on scientific text, a domain on which it has not been trained, and adapt it to this new domain.",
        "We also address the resolution of associative anaphora (Clark, 1975; Prince, 1981), a related phenomenon, which is also called bridging anaphora.",
        "The interpretation of an associative anaphor is based on the associated antecedent, but the two are not coreferent.",
        "Examples 1 and 2 show two science-specific cases of associative anaphora from our data.",
        "(1) Xe-Ar was found to be in a layered structure with Ar on the surface 1 .",
        "(2) We base our experiments on the Penn tree-bank.",
        "The corpus size is ...",
        "The resolution of associative links is important because it can help in tasks which use the concept of textual coherence, e.g. Barzilay and Lapata (2008)'s entity grid or Hearst (1994)'s text segmentation.",
        "They might also be of use in higher-level text understanding tasks such as textual entailment (Mirkin et al., 2010) or summarisation based on argument overlap (Kintsch and van Dijk, 1978; Fang and Teufel, 2014).",
        "Gasperin (2009) showed that biological texts differ considerably from other text genres, such as news text or dialogue.",
        "In this respect, our results confirm that the proportion between non-referring and referring entities in scientific text differs from that reported for other genres.",
        "The same holds for the type and relative number of linguistic expressions used for reference.",
        "To address this issue, we decided to investigate information status (Nissim et al., 2004) of noun phrases.",
        "Information status tells us whether a noun phrase refers to an already 1 Anaphors are typed in bold face, their antecedents shown in italics.",
        "45 known entity, or whether it can be treated as non-referring.",
        "Since no corpus of full-text scientific articles annotated with both information status and anaphoric relations was available, we had to create and annotate our own corpus.",
        "The main contributions of this work are (i) a new information status-based annotation scheme and an annotated corpus of scientific articles, (ii) a study of information status in scientific text that compares the distribution of the different categories in scientific text with the distribution in news text, as well as between the two scientific disciplines, (iii) experiments on the resolution of coreferent anaphora: we devise domain adaptation for science and show how this improves an out-of-the-box coreference resolver, and (iv) experiments on the resolution of associative anaphora with a coreference resolver that is adapted to this new notion of ?reference?",
        "by including semantic features.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on anaphora resolution in multi-discipline, full-text scientific papers that also deals with associative anaphora.",
        "2 Related Work Noun phrase coreference resolution is the task of determining which noun phrases (NPs) in a text or dialogue refer to the same real-world entities (Ng, 2010).",
        "Resolving anaphora in scientific text has only recently gained interest in the research community and focuses mostly on the biomedical domain (Gasperin, 2009; Batista-Navarro and Ana-niadou, 2011; Cohen et al., 2010).",
        "Some work has been done for other disciplines, such as computational linguistics.",
        "Sch?afer et al. (2012) present a large corpus of 266 full-text computational linguistics papers from the ACL Anthology, annotated with coreference links.",
        "The CoNLL shared task 2012 on modelling multilingual unrestricted coreference in OntoNotes (Pradhan et al., 2012) produced several state-of-the-art coreference systems (Fernandes et al., 2012; Bj?orkelund and Farkas, 2012; Chen and Ng, 2012) trained on news text and dialogue, as provided in the OntoNotes corpus (Hovy et al., 2006).",
        "Other state-of-the-art systems, such as Raghunathan et al. (2010) and Berkeley's Coreference Resolution System (Dur- rett and Klein, 2013), also treat coreference as a task on news text and dialogue.",
        "We base our experiments on the IMS coreference resolver by Bj?orkelund and Farkas (2012), one of the best publicly available English coreference systems.",
        "The resolver uses the decision of a cluster-based decoding algorithm, i.e. one that decides whether two mentions are placed in the same or in different clusters, or whether they should be considered singletons.",
        "Their novel idea is that the decision of this algorithm is encoded as a feature and fed to a pairwise classifier, which makes decisions about pairs of mentions rather than clusters.",
        "This stacked approach overcomes problems of previous systems that are based on the isolated pairwise decision.",
        "The features used are mostly taken from previous work on coreference resolution and encode a variety of information, i.e, surface forms and their POS tags, subcategorisation frames and paths in the syntax tree as well as the semantic distance between the surface forms (e.g. edit distance).",
        "However, none of this work is concerned with associative anaphora.",
        "Hou et al. (2013) present a corpus of news text annotated with associative links that are not limited with respect to semantic relations between anaphor and antecedent.",
        "Their experiments focus on antecedent selection only, assuming that the recognition of associative entities has already been performed.",
        "Information status has been investigated extensively in different genres such as news text, e.g. in Markert et al. (2012).",
        "Poesio and Vieira (1998) performed an information status-based corpus study on news text, defining the following categories: coreferential, bridging, larger situation, unfamiliar and doubt.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no study on information status in scientific text.",
        "In this paper, we propose a classification scheme for scientific text that is derived from Riester et al. (2010) and Poesio and Vieira (1998).",
        "We investigate the differences between news text and scientific text by analysing the distribution of information status categories.",
        "We hypothesise that the proportion of associative anaphora in scientific text is higher than in news text, making it necessary to resolve them in some form.",
        "Our experiments on the resolution of coreferent anaphora concern the domain-adaptation of a coreference resolver to this new domain and examine the effect of domain-dependent training data and features aimed at capturing technical terminology.",
        "We also present an unusual setup where we assume that an existing coreference resolver can also be used to identify associative links.",
        "We integrate semantic features in the hope of detecting cases where domain knowledge is required to establish the relation between the anaphor and the antecedent.",
        "46 Category Example COREFERENCE LINKS GIVEN (SPECIFIC) We present the following experiment.",

        "3.1 Annotation Scheme Two types of reference are annotated, namely COREFERENCE and ASSOCIATIVE LINKS.",
        "COREFERENCE LINKS are annotated for all types of nominal phrases; such links are annotated between enitites that refer to the same referent in the real world.",
        "ASSOCIATIVE LINKS and information status categories are only annotated for definite noun phrases.",
        "In our scheme, ASSOCIATIVE LINKS are only annotated when there is a clear relation between the two entities.",
        "As we do not pre-define possible associative relations, this definition is vague, but it is necessary to keep the task as general as possible.",
        "Additionally, we distinguish the following nine categories, as shown in Table 1 2 : The category GIVEN comprises coreferent entities that refer back to an already introduced entity.",
        "If a coreference link is detected, the referring expression is marked as GIVEN and the link with its referent NP is annotated.",
        "The obligatory attribute GENERIC tells us whether the given entity has a generic or a specific reading.",
        "ASSOCIATIVE refers to entities that are not coreferent but whose interpretation is based on a previously introduced entity.",
        "A typical relation between the two noun phrases is meronymy, but as mentioned above we do not pre-define a set of allowed semantic relations.",
        "2 The entity being classified is typed in bold face, referring expressions are marked by a box and the referent is shown in italics.",
        "The category ASSOCIATIVE (SELF-CONTAINING) comprises cases where we identify an associative relation between the head noun phrase and the modifier.",
        "ASSOCIATIVE SELF-CONTAINING entities are annotated without a link between the two parts.",
        "In scientific text, an entity is considered DEICTIC if it points to an object that is connected to the current text.",
        "Therefore, we include all entities that refer to the current paper (or aspects thereof) in this category.",
        "Entities that have not been mentioned before and are not related to any other entity in the text, but can be interpreted because they are part of the common knowledge of the writer and the reader are covered by the category UNUSED.",
        "DESCRIPTION is annotated for entities that are self-explanatory and typically occur in particular syntactic patterns such as NP complements or relative clauses.",
        "Idiomatic expressions or metaphoric use are covered in the category IDIOM.",
        "Predicative expressions, including appositions, are annotated as PREDICATIVE.",
        "Finally, the category DOUBT is used when the text or the antecedent is unclear.",
        "Note that NEW, a category that has been part of most previous classification schemes of information status, is not present as this information status is typically observed in indefinite noun phrases.",
        "As we deal exclusively with definite noun phrases 3 , we do not include this category in our scheme.",
        "In contrast to Poesio and Vieira's scheme, ours contains the additional categories PREDICATIVE, ASSOCIATIVE SELF-CONTAINING, DEICTIC and IDIOM.",

        "In particular, we are curious about which of the sys-tem's errors are domain-dependent.",
        "This analysis motivates a set of terminological features that are incorporated and tested in Section 6.",
        "4.1 Error Analysis Domain-dependent errors.",
        "The lack of seman-tic, domain-dependent knowledge results in the system's failure to identify coreferent expressions, e.g. those expressed as synonyms.",
        "This type of error can be prevented by implementing domain-dependent knowledge.",
        "In Example 3, we would like to generate a link between treebank and corpus as these terms are used as synonyms.",

        "(3) Experiments were performed with the clean part of the treebank.",
        "The corpus consists of 1 million words.",
        "(4) Amino acids are organic compounds made from amine (-NH2) and carboxylic acid (- COOH) functional groups.",
        "The protein-forming molecules ... Another common error is that the coreference resolver links all occurrences of demonstrative science-specific expressions such as this paper or this approach to each other, even if they are several paragraphs apart.",
        "In most cases, these demonstrative expressions do not corefer, but refer to an approach or a paper recently described or cited.",
        "This type of error is particularly frequent in the computational linguistics domain and might be reduced by a feature that captures this peculiarity.",
        "A special case occurs when authors re-use clauses of the abstract in the introduction.",
        "The coreference resolver then interprets rather large spans as coreferent which are not annotated in the gold standard.",
        "Yet a different kind of error is based on the fact that the coreference resolver has been trained on OntoNotes, i.e. mostly on non-written text.",
        "Thus, the classifier has not seen certain phenomena and, for example, links all occurrences of e.g. into one equivalence class as it is interpreted as a named entity.",
        "General errors.",
        "Some errors are general errors of coreference resolvers in the sense that they have very little to do with domain dependence, such as choosing the wrong antecedent or linking non-referential occurrences of it (see Examples 5 and 6).",
        "(5) This approach allows the processes of building referring expressions and identifying their referents.",
        "(6) The issue of how to design sirnas that produce high efficacy is the focus of a lot of current research.",

        "We create these using the information in 1000 computational linguistics and 1000 genetics papers that are not part of our scientific corpus.",
        "Non-coreferring bias list.",
        "Our first feature concentrates on nouns which have a low probability to be coreferring (i.e. category GIVEN) if they appear as the head of noun phrase.",
        "We assume that the normal case of coreference between definite noun phrases is that of a concept introduced as an indefinite NP and later referred to as a definite NP, and compile a list of lexemes that do not follow this pattern.",
        "NPs with those lexemes should be more likely to be of category UNUSED or DESCRIPTION.",
        "We find the lexemes by recording head nouns of definite NPs which are not observed in a prior indefinite NP in the same document (lo- cal list) or the entire document collection (global list).",
        "We create two lists of such head words for every discipline.",
        "The lexemes are arranged in decreasing order of their frequency so that we can use both their presence or non-presence on the list and their rank on the list as potential features.",
        "As can be seen in Table 5, the presence, the beginning and the literature are definite descriptions that are always used without having been introduced to the discourse.",
        "These terms are either part of domain knowledge (the hearer, the reader) or part of the general scientific terminology (the lit-erature).",
        "In the local list we see expressions that can be used without having been introduced, but 49 may in some contexts occur in the indefinite form as well, e.g. the word or the sentence.",

        "One of our hypotheses is that the NPs occurring in verb-object collocations are typically not part of any coreference chain.",
        "To test this, we use our collection of 2000 scientific papers to extract domain-specific verb-object collocations.",
        "We assume that for some collocations, this tendency is stronger (make use, take place) than for others that could potentially be coreferring (see figure, apply rule).",
        "The collocations have been identified with a term extraction tool (Gojun et al., 2012).",

        "As mentioned in Section 4.1, the baseline classifier often links demonstrative, science-specific entities, even if they are several paragraphs apart.",
        "To prevent this, we combine a distance measure with a set of 182 argumentation and work nouns taken from Teufel (2010), such as achievement, claim or experiment.",
        "We also create a small list of idioms as they are never part of a coreference chain.",

        "5.1 Types of Associative Anaphora To illustrate the different types of associative anaphora, we here show a few examples, mostly taken from the genetics papers.",
        "The anaphors are shown in bold face, the antecedents in italics.",
        "Many associative anaphors include noun phrases with the same head.",
        "In most of these cases, the anaphor contains a different modifier than the an-tecedent, such as (8) the negative strain ... the positive strain; (9) three categories ... the first category; (10) siRNAs ... the most effective siRNAs.",
        "We assume that these associative relations can be identified with a coreference resolver without adding additional features.",
        "Other cases are much harder to identify automatically, such as those where semantic knowledge is required to interpret the relation between the entities: (11) the classifier ... the training data; (12) this database ... the large dataset.",
        "In other cases, the nominal phrase in the antecedent tends to be derivationally related to the head word in the anaphor, as in (13) the spotty distribution ...the spots; (14) competitor ... the competitive effect.",
        "There are also a number of special cases, such as (15) the one interference process ... the other interference process.",
        "We hypothesise that the integration of semantic features discussed in the previous section enables the resolver to cover more than just those cases that are based on the similarity of word forms.",
        "5.2 Semantic Features It is apparent that the recognition and correct resolution of associative anaphora requires semantic knowledge.",
        "Therefore, we adapt the coreference resolver by extending the WordNet feature, one of the features implemented in the IMS resolver, to capture more than just synonyms.",
        "50 We use the following WordNet relations: Hyper-nymy (macromolecule ?",
        "protein), hyponymy (nucleoprotein ?",
        "protein), meronymy (surface ?",
        "structure), substance meronymy (amino acid ?",
        "protein), topic member (acute, chronic?",
        "medicine) and topic ( periodic table?",
        "chemistry).",
        "WordNet's coverage in the scientific domain is surprisingly good: 75,91 % of all common nouns in the GEN papers and 88,12 % in the CL papers are listed in WordNet.",
        "Terms that are not covered are, for example, abbreviations of different types of ribonucleic acid in genetics or specialist terms like tagging, subdialogue or SVM in computational linguistics.",
        "6 Experiments We now compare the performance of an out-of-the-box coreference system with the resolver trained on our annotated scientific corpus (Sec- tion 6.2).",
        "We also show the effect of adding additional features aimed at capturing technical terminology.",
        "In the experiments on the resolution of associative anaphora (Section 6.3), we test the hypothesis that the coreference resolver is able to adjust to the new notion of reference and show the effect of semantic features.",
        "6.1 Experimental Setup We perform our experiments using the IMS coreference resolver as a state-of-the-art coreference resolution system (Bj?orkelund and Farkas, 2012) 5 .",
        "The algorithm and the features included have not been changed except where otherwise stated.",
        "We use the OntoNotes datasets from the CoNLL 2011 shared task 6 (Pradhan et al., 2012; Hovy et al., 2006), only for training the out-of-the-box system.",
        "We also use WordNet version 3.0 as provided in the 2012 shared task 7 as well as JAWS, the Java API for WordNet searching 8 .",
        "Performance is reported on our annotated corpus, using 8-fold cross-validation and the official CoNLL scorer (version 5).",

        "MIXED, the version that combines the scientific corpus with the entire OntoNotes dataset, proves to work best (47.92 for GEN and 47.44 for CL).",
        "In THE BASELINE ver-sion, the performance on the CL papers is better than on the GEN papers.",
        "Interestingly, this is not true for the SCIENTIFIC version, where the performance on the GEN papers is better.",
        "However, as the main result here, we can see that training on scientific text was successful.",

        "This might indicate the need for a revised collocation list where those nouns are filtered out that could potentially be coreferring, e.g. see figure.",
        "For the best version of the CL papers, the increase in CoNLL score, compared with the MIXED version, is +1.08; for the GEN papers it is slightly less, namely +0.22.",

        "As expected, the performance on associative anaphora is worse than on coreferent anaphora.",
        "We have not made any changes to the resolver, so it is interesting to see that the resolver is indeed able to adjust to the new notion of reference and manages to link associative references.",
        "We found that the resolver generally identifies very few associative references and so the most common error of the system is that it fails to recognise associative relations, particularly if the computed edit distance, one of the standard features in the coreference resolver, is very high.",
        "The easiest associative relations to detect are those which have similar surface forms.",
        "For example, the coreference resolver correctly links RNAI and RNAI genes, the sense strand and the anti-sense strand or siRNAs and efficacious siRNAs.",
        "However, for most of the associative references, the lack of easily identifiable surface markers makes the task difficult.",
        "Ironically, the system also falsely classifies many coreference links as associative, although it has this time of course been trained only on associative references.",
        "This is not surprising, given that the tasks are so similar that we are able to use a coreference resolver for the associative task in the first place.",

        "For the genetics papers, the inclusion of synonyms, hyponyms and hypernyms results in the highest increase in performance (+2.02).",
        "For the computational linguistics pa-pers, the inclusion of synonyms, hyponyms, topics and meronyms obtains the best performance (+1.19).",
        "As the effect of the features is discipline-dependent, we create two separate final feature sets for the two disciplines.",
        "The GEN version contains synonyms, hyponyms and hypernyms while the CL version contains synonyms, hyponyms, topics and meronyms.",
        "The highest increase in performance for the CL feature set (and the one resulting in the final system) was achieved by dropping topic members and hypernyms.",
        "In the final CL system, the increase in performance compared to the baseline version is +1.35.",
        "Both final versions significantly outperform the baseline.",

        "The reason why this does not lead to an even larger increase in performance lies in the large number of false positives.",
        "However, when looking at the data it becomes apparent that the newly created links are mostly links that potentially could have been annotated during the anno-tation, but are not part of the gold standard because the associative antecedent is not absolutely necessary in order to interpret the anaphor or because the entity has been linked to a different entity where the associative relation is stronger.",
        "The existence of more-or-less acceptable alternative associative links casts some doubt on using a gold standard as the sole evaluation criterion.",
        "An alternative would be to ask humans for a rating of the sensibility of the links determined by the system.",
        "7 Conclusion and Future Work We have presented a study of information status in two scientific disciplines as well as preliminary experiments on the resolution of both coreferent and associative anaphora in these disciplines.",

        "Our corpus of 16 full-text scholarly papers annotated with information status and anaphoric links, which we plan to release soon, contains over 8000 annotated definite noun phrases.",
        "We demonstrate that the integration of domain-dependent terminological features, combined with domain-dependent training data, outperforms the unadjusted IMS system (Bj?orkelund and Farkas, 2012) by 36.47 % absolute on the CoNLL metric for the genetics papers and by 20.40 % absolute for the computational linguistics papers.",
        "The effect of domain-dependent training material was stronger than the integration of terminological features.",
        "As far as the resolution of associative anaphora is concerned, we have shown that it is generally possible to adapt a coreference resolver to this task, and we have achieved an improvement in performance using novel semantic features.",
        "We are currently performing an inter-annotator study with two additional an-notators, which will also lead to a better understanding of the relative difficulty of the categories.",
        "Furthermore, we plan to convert the coreference-annotated ACL papers by Sch?afer et al. (2012) into CoNLL format and use them for training the coreference resolver.",
        "As we have annotated our corpus with information status, it might also be interesting to train a classifier on the information status categories and use its predictions to improve the performance on anaphora resolution tasks.",
        "To do so, we will create a separate corpus for testing, annotated solely with coreference and associative links.",
