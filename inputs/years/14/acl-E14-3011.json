        "In this paper, we explore complex network properties of word collocation networks (Ferret, 2002) from four different genres.",
        "Each document of a particular genre was converted into a network of words with word collocations as edges.",
        "We analyzed graphically and statistically how the global properties of these networks varied across different genres, and among different network types within the same genre.",
        "Our results indicate that the distributions of network properties are visually similar but statistically apart across different genres, and interesting variations emerge when we consider different network types within a single genre.",
        "We further investigate how the global properties change as we add more and more collocation edges to the graph of one particular genre, and observe that except for the number of vertices and the size of the largest connected component, network properties change in phases, via jumps and drops."

        "Word collocation networks (Ferret, 2002; Ke, 2007), also known as collocation graphs (Heyer et al., 2001; Choudhury and Mukherjee, 2009), are networks of words found in a document or a document collection, where each node corresponds to a unique word type, and edges correspond to word collocations (Ke and Yao, 2008).",
        "In the simplest case, each edge corresponds to a unique bigram in the original document.",
        "For example, if the words w A and w B appeared together in a document as a bigram w A w B , then the word collocation network of that particular document will contain an edge w A ?",
        "w B .",
        "Note that edges can be directed (w A ?",
        "w B ) or undirected (w A ?",
        "w B ).",
        "Further-more, they can be weighted (with the frequency of the bigram w A w B ) or unweighted.",
        "It is interesting to note that word collocation networks display complex network structure, including power-law degree distribution and small-world behavior (Matsuo et al., 2001a; Matsuo et al., 2001b; Masucci and Rodgers, 2006; Liang et al., 2012).",
        "This is not surprising, given that natural language generally shows complex network properties at different levels (Ferrer i Cancho and Sol?e, 2001; Motter et al., 2003; Biemann et al., 2009; Liang et al., 2009).",
        "Moreover, researchers have used such complex networks in applications ranging from text genre identification (Stevanak et al., 2010) and Web query analysis (Saha Roy et al., 2011) to semantic analysis (Biemann et al., 2012) and opinion mining (Amancio et al., 2011).",
        "In Section 2, we will discuss some of these applications in more detail.",
        "The goal of this paper is to explore some key structural properties of these complex networks (cf. Table 1), and study how they vary across different genres of text, and also across different network types within the same genre.",
        "We chose global network properties like di-ameter, global clustering coefficient, shrinkage exponent (Leskovec et al., 2007), and small-worldliness (Walsh, 1999; Matsuo et al., 2001a), and experimented with four different text collections ?",
        "blogs, news articles, academic papers, and digitized books (Section 4.1).",
        "Six different types of word collocation networks were constructed on each document, as well as on the entire collections ?",
        "two with directed edges, and four with undirected edges (Section 3).",
        "We did not take into account edge weights in our study, and kept it as a part of our future work (Section 5).",
        "Tracking the variation of complex network properties on word collocation networks yielded several important observations and insights.",
        "We 96 noted in particular that different genres had considerable visual overlap in the distributions of global network properties like diameter and clustering coefficient (cf.",
        "Figure 2), although statistical significance tests indicated the distributions were sufficiently apart from each other (Sec- tion 4.2).",
        "This calls for a deeper analysis of complex network properties and their general applicability to tasks like genre identification (Stevanak et al., 2010).",
        "We further analyzed distributions of global word network properties across six different network types within the same genre (Section 4.2).",
        "This time, however, we noted a significant amount of separation ?",
        "both visually as well as statistically ?",
        "among the distributions of different global properties (cf.",
        "Figure 3 and Table 5).",
        "In our final set of experiments, we analyzed how global network properties change as we start with an empty network, and gradually add edges to that network.",
        "For this experiment, we chose the news genre, and tracked the variation of 17 different global network properties on four types of networks.",
        "We observed that all global network properties (except the number of vertices and edges, number of connected components and the size of the largest connected component) show unpredictability and spikes when the percentage of added edges is small.",
        "We also noted that most global properties showed at least one phase transition as the word collocation networks grew larger.",
        "Statistical significance tests indicated that the patterns of most global property variations were non-random and positively correlated (Section 4.3).",
        "2 Related Work That language shows complex network structure at the word level, was shown more than a decade ago by at least two independent groups of researchers (Ferrer i Cancho and Sol?e, 2001; Matsuo et al., 2001a).",
        "Matsuo et al. (2001b) went further ahead, and designed an unsupervised keyword extraction algorithm using the small-world property of word collocation networks.",
        "Motter et al. (2003) extended the collocation network idea to concepts rather than words, and observed a small-world structure in the resulting network.",
        "Edges between concepts were defined as entries in an English thesaurus.",
        "Liang et al. (2009) compared word collocation networks of Chinese and English text, and pointed out their similarities and differences.",
        "They further constructed character collocation networks in Chinese, showed their small-world structure, and used these networks in a follow-up study to accurately segregate Chinese essays from different literary periods (Liang et al., 2012).",
        "Word collocation networks have also been successfully applied to the authorship attribution task.",
        "1 Antiqueira et al. (2006) were among the first to apply complex network features like clustering coefficient, component dynamics deviation and degree correlation to the authorship attribution problem.",
        "Biemann et al. (2009) constructed syntactic and semantic distributional similarity networks (DSNs), and analyzed their structural differences using spectral plots.",
        "Biemann et al. (2012) further used graph motifs on collocation networks to distinguish real natural language text from generated natural language text, and to point out the shortcomings of n-gram language models.",
        "Word collocation networks have been used by Amancio et al. (2011) for opinion mining, and by Mihalcea and Tarau (2004) for keyword extraction.",
        "While the former study used complex network properties as features for machine learning algorithms, the latter ran PageRank (Page et al., 1998) on word collocation networks to sieve out most important words.",
        "While all the above studies are very important, we found none that performed a thorough and systematic exploration of different global network properties on different network types across gen-res, along with statistical significance tests to assess the validity of their observations.",
        "Stevanak et al. (2010), for example, used word collocation networks to distinguish between novels and news articles, but they did not perform a distributional analysis of the different global network properties they used, thereby leaving open how good those properties truly were as features for genre classifi-cation, and whether there exist a better and simpler set of global network properties for the same task.",
        "On the other hand, Masucci and Rodgers (2006), Ke (2007), and Ke and Yao (2008) explored several global network properties on word collocation networks, but they did not address the problem of analyzing within-genre and cross-genre variations of those properties.",
        "1 For details on authorship attribution, please see the surveys by Juola (2006), Koppel et al. (2009), and Sta-matatos (2009).",

        "The ones marked with an asterisk (?*?)",
        "are only used in Section 4.3 in the context of incrementally constructing networks by gradually adding edges.",
        "For document networks, these four properties do not make sense, because the number of connected components is always one, and the size of the largest connected component always equals the number of vertices in the document network.",
        "Note also that in-degree distribution, out-degree distribution, and the directed version of diameter do not make sense for undirected networks, and same goes with the number of strongly connected components and the size of the largest strongly connected component.",
        "Here we report them separately for conceptual clarity.",

        "We did not take into account edge weights in our study, and all our networks are therefore unweighted networks.",

        "In a realistic document network, there can be many such cycles.",
        "We constructed word collocation networks on document collections as well.",
        "In this case, the six network types remain as before, and the only difference comes from the fact that now the whole collection is considered a single super-document.",
        "Words in this super-document are connected according to bigram and trigram relationships.",
        "We respected document boundaries in this case, so the last word of a particular document does not link to the first word of the next document.",
        "The collection networks have only been used in Section 4.3 of this paper, to show how global network properties change as we add edges to the network.",
        "With the networks now constructed, we went ahead and explored several of their global properties (cf. Table 1).",
        "Properties were measured on each type of network on each document, thereby giving us property distributions across different genres of documents for a particular network type (cf.",
        "Figure 2), as well as property distributions across different network types for a particular genre (cf.",

        "We used the igraph software package (Csardi and Nepusz, 2006) for computing global network properties.",
        "Among the properties in Table 1, number of vertices (|V |) and number of edges (|E|) are self-explanatory.",
        "The shrinkage exponent (log |V | |E|) is motivated by the observations that the number of edges (|E|) follows a power-law relationship with the number of vertices (|V |), and that as a network evolves, both |V | and |E| continue to grow, but the diameter of the network either shrinks or plateaus out, thereby resulting in a densified network (Leskovec et al., 2007).",

        "4.3 Change of Global Network Properties with Gradual Addition of Edges To see how global network properties change as we gradually add edges to a network, we took the whole news collection, and constructed a directed word collocation network on the whole col-lection, essentially considering the collection as a super-document (cf.",
        "Section 3).",
        "We studied how properties change as we consider top k% of edges in this super-network, with k ranging from 1 to 100 in steps of 1.",

        "Note that the number of connected components and the number of strongly connected components increase first, and then decrease.",
        "The number of vertices, size of the largest strongly connected component, and size of the largest connected component increase monotonically as we consider more and more collocation edges.",
        "For other properties, we see a lot of unpredictability and spikes (see, e.g., Figures 4d, 4e, 4g, and 4h), especially when the percentage of added edges is small.",
        "We performed Runs Test, Bartels Test, and Mann-Kendall Test to figure out if these trends are random, and the resulting p-values indicate that they are not random, and in fact positively correlated (i.e., increasing).",
        "Details of these tests are in the supplementary material.",
        "Note also that all figures except Figures 4a, 4k, and 4l show at least one phase transition (i.e., a ?jump?",
        "or a ?bend?).",
        "5 Conclusion We performed an exploratory analysis of global properties of word collocation networks across four different genres of text, and across different network types within the same genre.",
        "Our analyses reveal that cross-genre and within-genre variations are statistically significant, and incremental construction of collocation networks by gradually adding edges leads to non-random and positively correlated fluctuations in many global properties, some of them displaying single or multiple phase transitions.",
        "Future work consists of the inclusion of edge weights; exploration of other datasets, network properties, and network types; and applying those properties to the genre classification task.",
