        "Temporality has recently received increased attention in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR).",
        "Initial works have been proposed in NLP and are exhaustively summarized in (Mani et al., 2005).",
        "More recently, the introduction of the TempEval task (Verhagen et al., 2009) in the Semantic Evaluation workshop series has clearly established the importance of time to deal with different NLP tasks.",
        "The ultimate aim of research in this area is the automatic identification of temporal expressions (timexes), events and temporal relations within a text in the TimeML format (Pustejovsky et al., 2005).",
        "In IR, the time dimension has also received particular attention for the past few years.",
        "According to (Metzger, 2007), time is one of the key five aspects that determine a document credibility besides relevance, accuracy, objectivity and coverage.",
        "So, the value of information or its quality is intrinsically time-dependent.",
        "As a consequence, a new reasearch field called Temporal Information Retrieval (T-IR) has emerged (Alonso et al., 2011) and deals with all classical IR tasks such as crawling (Kulkarni et al., 2011), indexing (Anand et al., 2012) or ranking (Kanhabua et al., 2011) from the time viewpoint.",
        "However, both NLP and IR evidence the lack of temporal lexical resources.",
        "For example, automatic temporal ordering of events in text is usually performed via various linguistic mechanisms including the use of time expressions such as ?be- fore?,?after?",
        "or ?during?",
        "that explicitly assert a temporal relation.",
        "In particular, (Derczynski and Gaizauskas, 2012) investigate the role of temporal signals in temporal relation extraction over the TimeBank annotated corpus.",
        "However, the list of such expressions is limited.",
        "From the IR view-point, most methodologies rely on the presence of explicit timexes and hardly bridge the gap when no explicit mention of time is available.",
        "One recent exception is proposed in (Jatowt et al., 2013) where text time-tagging is seen as a classification task, but no use of specific temporal clues is introduced or proposed.",
        "Inspired by SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebas-tiani, 2006), we propose to introduce the temporal connotation of each synset in WordNet (Miller, 1995) by iteratively learning temporal classifiers from an initial set of time-sensitive synsets and a given propagation strategy.",
        "As such, each synset is automatically time-tagged with four dimensions i.e. atemporal, past, present and future, thus giving rise to different TempoWordNets depending on the propagation strategy.",
        "TempoWordNets are evaluated both manually and automatically.",
        "First, results show that manual annotation of time-tagged synsets is a hard task for humans.",
        "Second, automatic evaluation based on sentence temporal classification shows that the introduction of time-augmented lexical knowledge bases (TempoWordNets) allows 3.9% improvements of F 1 -measure against the vector space model representation and 4.2% against the semantic vector space model obtained with the existing WordNet time subtree.",
        "2 Related Work A great deal of works have been proposed in temporal NLP.",
        "Most recent studies have been developed in the context of the TempEval evaluation contests, which were initiated by (Verhagen et al., 6 2007).",
        "TempEval was initially divided into three challenges: (A) identifying temporal relations between events and time expressions, (B) identifying temporal relations between events and the document creation time and (C) identifying the temporal relations between contiguous pairs of matrix verbs.",
        "In TempEval-2 (Pustejovsky and Verhagen, 2009), the best performing systems were based on conditional random fields mixed with parsing methodologies (UzZaman and Allen, 2010).",
        "More recently, in TempEval-3 (UzZaman et al., 2013), new systems have been performing at high level of performance for all three tasks such as the rule-based multilingual temporal tagger Heidel-time (Str?otgen and Gertz, 2013).",
        "In IR, the work of (Baeza-Yates, 2005) defines the foundations of T-IR.",
        "Since, research have been tackling several topics such as query understanding (Metzler et al., 2009), temporal snippets generation (Alonso et al., 2007), temporal ranking (Kanhabua et al., 2011), temporal clustering (Alonso et al., 2009), future retrieval (Radinsky and Horvitz, 2013) or temporal image retrieval (Dias et al., 2012).",
        "As expressed in (Str?otgen and Gertz, 2013), time taggers usually contain pattern files with words and phrases, which are typically used to express temporal expressions in a given language (e.g. names of months).",
        "In fact, most temporal NLP tasks rely on a time-sensitive vocabulary.",
        "On the contrary, T-IR systems usually do not use information about time in language although they could benefit from it when facing the recurrent problem of missing explicit timexes.",
        "WordNet is a good place to start to find time-sensitive concepts.",
        "Indeed, one can list a set of 21 temporal synsets by iteratively following the hyponym relation from the concept of time (synset # 00028270) represented by the following gloss: the continuum of experience in which events pass from the future through the present to the past.",
        "However, likewise the tennis problem evidenced in (Fellbaum, 1998), most temporal words are not under the concept of time.",
        "For example, concepts such as ?prediction?, ?remember?, ?an- cient?",
        "or ?fresh?",
        "clearly have a time dimension although they are not listed under the time subtree of WordNet.",
        "Based on the intial ideas of (Moens and Steedman, 1987) on temporal ontologies and inspired by SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006), we propose to enrich all WordNet synsets with their temporal connotation.",
        "3 TempoWordNet as SentiWordNet In (Dias et al., 2014), we first proposed to build TempoWordNet based on the idea of (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) for SentiWordNet.",
        "Each synset is automatically time-tagged with four dimensions i.e. atemporal, past, present and future by performing a two-step process.",
        "A first temporal classifier is built based on a set of manually selected seed synsets and their corresponding glosses tagged as past, present and future.",
        "This process is then iterated based on the repetitive lexico-semantic expansion 1 of the initial seeds lists until cross-validation accuracy drops.",
        "This first step results in a three-class temporal classifier and an expanded list of temporal synset candidates.",
        "A second temporal classifier is then learned to time-tag synsets as atemporal or temporal.",
        "This process is obtained by taking the final list of expanded seed synsets from the previous learning problem and randomly choosing a balanced number atemporal synsets.",
        "A 10-fold cross-validation is then used to learn the model.",
        "TempoWordNet is finally obtained by (1) classifying all WordNet synsets as atemporal or temporal with the second classifier and (2) the resulting temporal synsets are tagged as past, present and future by the first classifier.",
        "This step is detailed in (Dias et al., 2014) and all materials can be found at http://tempowordnet.greyc.fr.",
        "4 Diversified Expansion Strategies The initial strategy proposed in the previous section evidences a clear lack.",
        "As the expansion process is semantically driven, the temporal connotation is highly depend on the initial seeds lists and as a consequence may not spread over a wide range of concepts in WordNet.",
        "As such, we propose two different strategies of expansion: (1) the probabilistic expansion and (2) the hybrid (proba- bilistic combined with semantic) expansion.",
        "Probabilistic Expansion: We first learn a temporal vs. atemporal classifier based on the initial hand-crafted set of seeds proposed in (Dias et al., 2014).",
        "In particular, the seeds defined as past, present and future are markers of temporal-ity, while the list of atemporal synsets is the obvious counterpart.",
        "Based on this list of tempo-1 Only exisiting lexico-semantic links inWordNet are used to propagate the temporal connotation.",
        "7 ral and atemporal synsets, a 10-fold cross validation process is performed to learn the temporal vs. atemporal model, which is used to time-tag the whole WordNet.",
        "The synsets (or glosses) with highest temporal and atemporal values in WordNet are then used for the expansion process of the seeds lists.",
        "The process is iteratively performed and stops when accuracy drops.",
        "After building the temporal vs. atemporal clas-sifier, WordNet is divided into two subsets: temporal synsets and atemporal ones.",
        "In order to fine tune the temporal part of WordNet, we learn a three-class classifier (i.e. past, present and fu-ture) based on the initial past, present and future seeds lists and the probabilistic expansion exclusively 2 within the temporal part of WordNet.",
        "So, a 10-fold cross validation process is iteratively performed until accuracy drops.",
        "The results of the probabilistic expansion are presented in Table 1 and Table 2, when the expansion is based on the maximum probability value 3 .",
        "Steps 1 2 3 Precision 87.3 100 100 Recall 86.7 100 100 F 1 -measure 86.9 100 100 Table 1: Cross validation for temporal vs. atemporal at each iteration.",

        "Probabilistic Expansion.",
        "Note that in our experiment, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with a linear kernel 4 over the vector space model representation of the synsets (i.e. each synset is represented by its gloss encoded as a vector of unigrams weighted by their frequency) have been used to classify all the synsets of WordNet.",
        "The results show that in both cases the expansion process stops at iteration 2.",
        "2 Only temporal synsets are classified as past, present or future and used for the expansion process.",
        "Note that unbalanced sets can be formed.",
        "3 That means that all the synsets getting the highest value produced by the classifier are used to expand the initial seeds lists.",
        "4 We used theWeka implementation SMOwith default parameters.",
        "Hybrid Expansion: Choosing synsets from WordNet with highest probability assigned by a classifier learned on the glosses of initial seeds lists can lead to the well-known semantic shift problem.",
        "So, the idea of the hybrid expansion is to control the expansion process so that the most probable time-sensitive synsets are also chosen based on their semantic distance with the expanded seed synsets at the previous iteration.",
        "The process is straightforward when compared to the probabilistic expansion.",
        "First, a two-class (temporal vs. atemporal) text classifier is trained based on the glosses of each synsets contained in the initial seed lists to classify all the synsets of WordNet.",
        "Thereafter, WordNet synsets with highest probability are selected as candidates for expansion.",
        "From these candidates, only the ones that present the maximum semantic similarity to the previous seeds lists are chosen for expansion.",
        "Note that the semantic similarity is calculated between the candidate synset and all synsets in the previous expanded seeds lists.",
        "Once candidates for expansion have been chosen, a 10-fold cross validation process is iteratively performed until accuracy becomes steady.",
        "Second, a three-class (past, present and fu-ture) classifier is learned over the temporal part of WordNet with the hybrid expansion process in the same exact manner as explained for the previous probabilistic expansion.",
        "Results for the expansion process are presented in the Table 3 and Table 4 for the same experimental setups as for the probabilistic expansion and using the (Leacock et al., 1998) semantic similarity measure 5 .",
        "Steps 1 2 ... 25 26 27 Precision 87.3 94.1 ... 96.0 97.2 96.6 Recall 86.7 93.2 ... 95.5 97.0 96.3 F 1 -measure 86.9 93.6 ... 95.7 97.1 96.4 Table 3: Cross validation for temporal vs. atemporal at each iteration.",

        "Evaluation: In order to intrinsically evaluate the time-tagged WordNets (TempoWordNets), we first performed an inter-annotation process over samples of 50 automatically time-tagged WordNet synsets.",
        "In particular, three different annotators were presented with temporal synsets and their respective glosses, and had to decide upon their correct classification (temporal vs. atempo-ral).",
        "The results of the multirater agreement evaluation are presented in Table 6.",
        "In particular, we processed the free-marginal multirater kappa values (Randolph, 2005) and the fixed-marginal multirater kappa (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) as no bias is present in the data.",

        "These results evidence the difficulty of the task for humans as they do not agree on a great deal of decisions.",

        "The results of our experiments are reported in Table 5.",
        "The results evidence that the WordNet time subtree does not embody enough time-related information and the process of automatically time-tagging WordNet can improve the task of sentence temporal classification, especially with the probabilistic or the hybrid expansion.",
        "6 Conclusion In this paper, we proposed the first steps towards the automatic construction of temporal ontologies.",
        "In particular, we presented and evaluated different propagation strategies to time tag WordNet giving rise to different TempoWordNets.",
