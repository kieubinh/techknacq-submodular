        "Interestingly, we also find that when applied to equivalent English data, the model performance is almost identical.",
        "This finding suggests a systematic pattern of cross-linguistic transfer may exist, where the degree of transfer is independent of the L1 and L2."

        "Native Language Identification (NLI) is the task of identifying an author's native language (L1) based on their writings in a second language (the L2).",
        "NLI works by identifying language use patterns that are common to groups of speakers that share the same native language.",
        "This process is underpinned by the presupposition that an author's L1 will dispose them towards particular language production patterns in their L2, as influenced by their mother tongue.",
        "This relates to Cross-Linguistic Influence (CLI), a key topic in the field of Second Language Acquisition (SLA) that analyzes transfer effects from the L1 on later learned languages (Ortega, 2009).",
        "While NLI has applications in security, most research has a strong linguistic motivation relating to language teaching and learning.",
        "Rising numbers of language learners have led to an increasing need for language learning resources, which has in turn fuelled much of the language acquisition research of the past decade.",
        "In this context, by identifying L1-specific language usage and error patterns, NLI can be used to better understand SLA and develop teaching methods, instructions and learner feedback that is specific to their mother tongue.",
        "However, all of the NLI research to date has focused exclusively on English L2 data.",
        "To this end there is a need to apply NLI to other languages, not only to gauge their applicability but also to aid in teaching research for other emerging languages.",
        "Interest in learning Chinese is rapidly growing, leading to increased research in Teaching Chinese as a Second Language (TCSL) and the development of related resources such as learner corpora (Chen et al., 2010).",
        "The application of these tools and scientific methods like NLI can greatly assist researchers in creating effective teaching practices and is an area of active research.",
        "The aim of this research is to evaluate the cross-language applicability of NLI techniques by applying them to Chinese learner texts, evaluating their efficacy and comparing the results with their English equivalents.",
        "To the best of our knowledge this is the first reported application of NLI to non-English data and we believe this is an important step in gaining deeper insights about the technique.",
        "2 Related Work NLI is a fairly recent, but rapidly growing area of research.",
        "While some research was conducted in the early 2000s, the most significant work has only appeared in the last few years (Wong and Dras, 2009; Wong and Dras, 2011; Swanson and Char-niak, 2012; Tetreault et al., 2012; Bykh and Meur-ers, 2012).",
        "Most studies approach NLI as a multi-class supervised classification task.",
        "In this experimental design, the L1 metadata are used as class labels 95 and the individual writings are used as training and testing data.",
        "Using lexical and syntactic features of increasing sophistication, researchers have obtained good results under this paradigm.",
        "While a detailed exposition of NLI has been omitted here due to space constraints, a concise review can be found in Bykh and Meurers (2012).",
        "2.1 NLI 2013 Shared Task This increased interest brought unprecedented level of research focus and momentum, resulting in the first NLI shared task being held in 2013.",
        "1 The shared task aimed to facilitate the comparison of results by providing a large NLI-specific dataset and evaluation procedure, to enable direct comparison of results achieved through different methods.",
        "Overall, the event was considered a success, drawing 29 entrants and experts from not only Computational Linguistics, but also SLA.",
        "The best teams achieved accuracies of greater than 80% on this 11-class classification task.",
        "A detailed summary of the results is presented in Tetreault et al. (2013).",
        "3 Data Growing interest has led to the recent development of the Chinese Learner Corpus (Wang et al., 2012), the first large-scale corpus of learner texts comprised of essays written by university students.",
        "Learners from 59 countries are represented and proficiency levels have been sampled representatively across beginners, intermediate and advanced learners.",
        "However, texts by native speakers of other Asian countries are disproportionately represented, likely due to geographical proximity.",
        "For this work we extracted 3.75 million tokens of text from the CLC in the form of individual sentences.",
        "2 Following the methodology of Brooke and Hirst (2011), we combine the sentences from the same L1 to form texts of 600 tokens on aver-age, creating a set of documents suitable for NLI 3 .",
        "We choose the top 11 languages, shown in Table 1, to use in our experiments.",
        "This is due to two considerations.",
        "First, while many L1s are represented in the corpus, most have relatively few texts.",
        "Choosing the top 11 classes allows us to 1 Organised by the Educational Testing Service and co-located with the eighth instalment of the Building Educational Applications Workshop at NAACL/HLT 2013. sites.google.com/site/nlisharedtask2013/ 2 Full texts are not made available, only individual sentences with the relevant metadata (proficiency/nationality).",

        "4 Experimental Setup We also follow the supervised classification approach described in ?2.",
        "We devise and run experiments using several models that capture different types of linguistic information.",
        "For each model, features are extracted from the texts and a classifier is trained to predict the L1 labels using the features.",
        "As our data is not topic-balanced, we avoid using topic-dependent lexical features such as character or word n-grams.",
        "Each experiment is run with two feature repre-sentations: binary (presence/absence of a feature) and normalized frequencies, where feature values are normalized to text length using the l2-norm.",

        "4.2 Classifier We use Support Vector Machines for classification.",
        "Specifically, we use the LIBLINEAR SVM package (Fan et al., 2008) as it is well-suited to text classification tasks with large numbers of features and texts.",
        "We use the L2-regularized L2-loss support vector classification (dual) solver.",
        "4.3 Evaluation The same evaluation metrics and standards used in the NLI2013 Shared Task are used: we report classification accuracy under 10-fold cross-validation.",
        "We also use the same number of classes as the shared task to facilitate comparative analyses.",

        "5 Experiments and Results 5.1 Part-of-Speech tag n-grams Our first experiment assesses the utility of the syntactic information captured by part-of-speech (PoS) tags for Chinese NLI.",
        "The PoS tags for each text are predicted and n-grams of size 1?3 are extracted from the tags.",
        "These n-grams capture (very local) syntactic patterns of language use and are used as classification features.",
        "The results for these three features, and our other models are shown in Table 2.",
        "The trigram frequencies give the best accuracy of 55.60%, suggesting that there exist group-specific patterns of Chinese word order and category choice which provide a highly discriminative cue about the L1.",
        "5.2 Function Words As opposed to content words, function words are topic-independent grammatical words that indicate the relations between other words.",
        "They include determiners, conjunctions and auxiliary verbs.",
        "Distributions of English function words have been found to be useful in studies of authorship attribution and NLI.",
        "Unlike PoS tags, this model analyzes the author's specific word choices.",
        "We compiled a list of 449 Chinese function words 5 to be used as features in this model.",
        "As shown in Table 2, the function word frequency features provide the best accuracy of 51.91%, significantly higher than the random baseline.",
        "This again suggests the presence of L1-specific grammatical and lexical choice patterns that can help distinguish the L1, potentially due to cross-linguistic transfer.",
        "Such lexical transfer effects 5 The function word list was compiled from Chinese language teaching resources.",

        "These effects are mediated not only by cognates and similarities in word forms, but also word semantics and meanings.",
        "5.3 Context-free Grammar Production Rules In the next experiment we investigate the differences in the distribution of the context-free grammar production rules used by the learners.",
        "To do this, constituent parses for all sentences are obtained and the production rules, excluding lexical-izations, are extracted.",
        "Figure 1 shows a sample tree and rules.",
        "These context-free phrase structure rules capture the overall structure of grammatical constructions and are used as classification features in this experiment.",
        "As seen in Table 2, the model achieves an accuracy of 49.80%.",
        "This supports the hypothesis that the syntactic substructures contain characteristic constructions specific to L1 groups and that these syntactic cues strongly signal the writer's L1.",
        "5.4 Combining All Features Finally, we assess the redundancy of the information captured by our models by combining them all into one vector space to create a single classifier.",
        "From Table 2 we see that for each feature representation, the combined feature results are higher than the single best feature, with a max-97 imum accuracy of 70.61%.",
        "This demonstrates that for at least some of the features, the information they capture is orthogonal and complemen-tary, and combining them can improve results.",
        "6 Discussion A key finding here is that NLI models can be successfully applied to non-English data.",
        "This is an important step for furthering NLI research as the field is still relatively young and many fundamental questions have yet to be answered.",
        "All of the tested models are effective, and they appear to be complementary as combining them improves overall accuracy.",
        "We also note the difference in the efficacy of the feature representations and see a clear preference for frequency-based feature values.",
        "Others have found that binary features are the most effective for English NLI (Brooke and Hirst, 2012), but our results indicate frequency information is more informative in this task.",
        "The combination of both feature types has also been reported to be effective (Malmasi et al., 2013).",
        "To see how these models perform across lan-guages, we also compare the results against the TOEFL11 corpus used in the NLI2013 shared task.",
        "We perform the same experiments on that dataset using the English CoreNLP models, Penn Treebank PoS tagset and a set of 400 English function words.",
        "Figure 2 shows the results side by side.",
        "Remarkably, we see that the model results closely mirror each other across corpora.",
        "This is a highly interesting finding from our study that merits further investigation.",
        "There is a systematic pattern occurring across data from learners of completely different L1-L2 pairs.",
        "This suggests that manifestations of CLI via surface phenomena occur at the same levels and patternings regardless of the L2.",
        "Cross-language studies can help researchers in linguistics and cognitive science to better understand the SLA process and language transfer effects.",
        "They can enhance our understanding of how language is processed in the brain in ways that are not possible by just studying monolinguals or single L1-L2 pairs, thereby providing us with important insights that increase our knowledge and understanding of the human language faculty.",
        "One limitation of this work is the lack of similar amounts of training data for each language.",
        "However, many of the early and influential NLI studies (e.g. Koppel et al. (2005), Tsur and Rap-poport (2007)) were performed under similar cir-PoS-1 PoS-2 PoS-3 FW PR 0 20 40 60 A c c u r a c y ( % ) Chinese English Figure 2: Comparing feature performance on the Chinese Learner Corpus and English TOEFL11 corpora.",
        "PoS-1/2/3: PoS uni/bi/trigrams, FW: Function Words, PR: Production Rules cumstances.",
        "This issue was noted at the time, but did not deter researchers as corpora with similar issues were used for many years.",
        "Non-English NLI is also at a similar state where the extant corpora are not optimal for the task, but no other alternatives exist for conducting this research.",
        "Finally, there are also a number of way to further develop this work.",
        "Firstly, the experimental scope could be expanded to use even more linguistically sophisticated features such as dependency parses.",
        "Model accuracy could potentially be improved by using the metadata to develop proficiency-segregated models.",
        "Classifier ensembles could also help in increasing the accuracy.",
        "7 Conclusion In this work we have presented the first application of NLI to non-English data.",
        "Using the Chinese Learner Corpus, we compare models based on PoS tags, function words and context-free grammar production rules and find that they all yield high classification accuracies.",
        "Comparing the models against an equivalent English learner corpus we find that the accuracies are almost identical across both L2s, suggesting a systematic pattern of cross-linguistic transfer where the degree of transfer is independent of the L1 and L2.",
        "Further research with other L2 learner corpora is needed to investigate this phenomena.",
