        "FrameNet (Fillmore, Johnson, and Petruck 2003) is a linguistic resource storing considerable information about lexical and predicate-argument semantics in English.",
        "Grounded in the theory of frame semantics (Fillmore 1982), it suggests?but does not formally define?a semantic representation that blends representations familiar from word-sense disambiguation (Ide and Ve?ronis 1998) and semantic role labeling (SRL; Gildea and Jurafsky 2002).",
        "Given the limited size of available resources, accurately producing richly structured frame-semantic structures with high coverage will require data-driven techniques beyond simple supervised classification, such as latent variable modeling, semi-supervised learning, and joint inference.",
        "In this article, we present a computational and statistical model for frame-semantic parsing, the problem of extracting from text semantic predicate-argument structures such as those shown in Figure 1.",
        "We aim to predict a frame-semantic representation with two statistical models rather than a collection of local classifiers, unlike earlier approaches (Baker, Ellsworth, and Erk 2007).",
        "We use a probabilistic framework that cleanly integrates the FrameNet lexicon and limited available training data.",
        "The probabilistic framework we adopt is highly amenable to future extension through new features, more relaxed independence assumptions, and additional semi-supervised models.",
        "Carefully constructed lexical resources and annotated data sets from FrameNet, detailed in Section 3, form the basis of the frame structure prediction task.",
        "We decompose this task into three subproblems: target identification (Section 4), in which frame-evoking predicates are marked in the sentence; frame identification (Section 5), in which the evoked frame is selected for each predicate; and argument identification (Section 6), in which arguments to each frame are identified and labeled with a role from that frame.",
        "Experiments demonstrating favorable performance to the previous state of the art on SemEval 2007 and FrameNet data sets are described in each section.",
        "Some novel aspects of our approach include a latent-variable model (Section 5.2) and a semi-supervised extension of the predicate lexicon (Section 5.5) to facilitate disambiguation of words not in the FrameNet lexicon; a unified model for finding and labeling arguments Figure 1 An example sentence from the annotations released as part of FrameNet 1.5 with three targets marked in bold.",
        "Note that this annotation is partial because not all potential targets have been annotated with predicate-argument structures.",
        "Each target has its evoked semantic frame marked above it, enclosed in a distinct shape or border style.",
        "For each frame, its semantic roles are shown enclosed within the same shape or border style, and the spans fulfilling the roles are connected to the latter using dotted lines.",
        "For example, manner evokes the CONDUCT frame, and has the AGENT and MANNER roles fulfilled by Austria and most un-Viennese, respectively.",
        "(Section 6) that diverges from prior work in semantic role labeling; and an exact dual decomposition algorithm (Section 7) that collectively predicts all the arguments of a frame together, thereby incorporating linguistic constraints in a principled fashion.",
        "Our open-source parser, named SEMAFOR (Semantic Analyzer of Frame Represen-tations)1 achieves the best published results to date on the SemEval 2007 frame-semantic structure extraction task (Baker, Ellsworth, and Erk 2007).",
        "Herein, we also present results on newly released data with FrameNet 1.5, the latest edition of the lexicon.",
        "Some of the material presented in this article has appeared in previously published conference papers: Das et al. (2010) presented the basic model, Das and Smith (2011) described semi-supervised lexicon expansion, Das and Smith (2012) demonstrated a sparse variant of lexicon expansion, and Das, Martins, and Smith (2012) presented the dual decomposition algorithm for constrained joint argument identification.",

        "Results on full frame-semantic parsing using graph-based semi-supervised learning with sparsity-inducing penalties; this expands the small FrameNet predicate lexicon, enabling us to handle unknown predicates.",
        "Our primary contributions are the use of efficient structured prediction techniques suited to shallow semantic parsing problems, novel methods in semi-supervised learning that improve the lexical coverage of our parser, and making frame-semantic structures a viable computational semantic representation usable in other language technologies.",
        "To set the stage, we next consider related work in the automatic prediction of predicate-argument semantic structures.",

        "phrase-structure syntax trees from the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Marcinkiewicz, and Santorini 1993) annotated with predicate-argument structures for verbs.",
        "In Figure 2(a), the syntax tree for the sentence is marked with various semantic roles.",
        "The two main verbs in the sentence, created and pushed, are the predicates.",
        "For the former, the constituent more than 1.2 million jobs serves as the semantic role ARG1 and the constituent In that time serves as the role ARGM-TMP.",
        "Similarly for the latter verb, roles ARG1, ARG2, ARGM-DIR, and ARGM-TMP are shown in the figure.",
        "PropBank defines core roles ARG0 through ARG5, which receive different interpretations for different predicates.",
        "Additional modifier roles ARGM-* include ARGM-TMP (temporal) and ARGM-DIR (directional), as shown in Figure 2(a).",
        "The PropBank representation therefore has a small number of roles, and the training data set comprises some 40,000 sentences, thus making the semantic role labeling task an attractive one from the perspective of machine learning.",
        "There are many instances of influential work on semantic role labeling using PropBank conventions.",
        "Pradhan et al. (2004) present a system that uses support vector machines (SVMs) to identify the arguments in a syntax tree that can serve as semantic roles, followed by classification of the identified arguments to role names via a collection of binary SVMs.",
        "Punyakanok et al. (2004) describe a semantic role labeler that uses integer linear programming for inference and uses several global constraints to find the best suited predicate-argument structures.",
        "Joint modeling for semantic role labeling with discriminative log-linear models is presented by Toutanova, Haghighi, and Manning (2005), where global features looking at all arguments of a particular verb together are incorporated into a dynamic programming and reranking framework.",
        "The Computational Linguistics special issue on semantic role labeling (Ma`rquez et al. 2008) includes other interesting papers on the topic, leveraging the PropBank conventions for labeling shallow semantic structures.",
        "Recently, there have been initiatives to predict syntactic dependencies as well as PropBank-style predicate-argument structures together using one joint model (Surdeanu et al. 2008; Hajic?",
        "et al. 2009).",
        "Here, we focus on the related problem of frame-semantic parsing.",
        "Note from the annotated semantic roles for the two verbs in the sentence of Figure 2(a) that it is unclear what the core roles ARG1 or ARG2 represent linguistically.",
        "To better understand the roles?",
        "meaning for a given verb, one has to refer to a verb-specific file provided along with the PropBank corpus.",
        "Although collapsing these verb-specific core roles into tags ARG0-ARG5 leads to a small set of classes to be learned from a reasonable sized corpus, analysis shows that the roles ARG2?ARG5 serve many different purposes for different verbs.",
        "Yi, Loper, and Palmer (2007) point out that these four roles are highly overloaded and inconsistent, and they mapped them to VerbNet (Schuler 2005) thematic roles to get improvements on the SRL task.",
        "Recently, Bauer and Rambow (2011) presented a method to improve the syntactic subcategorization patterns for FrameNet lexical units using VerbNet.",
        "Instead of working with PropBank, we focus on shallow semantic parsing of sentences in the paradigm of frame semantics (Fillmore 1982), to which we turn next.",
        "2.2 Frame-Semantic Parsing The FrameNet lexicon (Fillmore, Johnson, and Petruck 2003) contains rich linguistic information about lexical items and predicate-argument structures.",
        "A semantic frame present in this lexicon includes a list of lexical units, which are associated words and phrases that can potentially evoke it in a natural language utterance.",
        "Each frame in the lexicon also enumerates several roles corresponding to facets of the scenario represented by the frame.",
        "In a frame-analyzed sentence, predicates evoking frames are known as targets, and a word or phrase filling a role is known as an argument.",
        "Figure 2(b) shows frame-semantic annotations for the same sentence as in Figure 2(a).",
        "(In the figure, for example, the CARDINAL NUMBERS frame, ?M?",
        "denotes the role Multiplier and ?E?",
        "denotes the role Entity.)",
        "Note that the verbs created and pushed evoke the frames INTENTIONALLY CREATE and CAUSE CHANGE POSITION ON A SCALE, respectively.",
        "The corresponding lexical units2 from the FrameNet lexicon, create.V and push.V, are also shown.",
        "The PropBank analysis in Figure 2(a) also has annotations for these two verbs.",
        "While PropBank labels the roles of these verbs with its limited set of tags, the frame-semantic parse labels each frame's arguments with frame-specific roles shown in the figure, making it immediately clear what those arguments mean.",
        "For example, for the INTENTIONALLY CREATE frame, more than 1.2 million jobs is the Created entity, and In that time is the Time when the jobs were created.",
        "FrameNet also allows non-verbal words and phrases to evoke semantic frames: in this sentence, million evokes the frame CARDINAL NUMBERS and doubles as its Number argument, with 1.2 as Multiplier, jobs as the Entity being quantified, and more than as the Precision of the quantity expression.",

        "No particular significance is ascribed to the ordering of a frame's roles in its lexicon entry (the selection and ordering of roles above is for illustrative convenience).",
        "CAUSE TO MAKE NOISE defines a total of 14 roles, many of them not shown here.",
        "Whereas PropBank contains verbal predicates and NomBank (Meyers et al. 2004) contains nominal predicates, FrameNet counts these as well as allowing adjectives, adverbs, and prepositions among its lexical units.",
        "Finally, FrameNet frames organize predicates according to semantic principles, both by allowing related terms to evoke a common frame (e.g., push.V, raise.V, and growth.N for CAUSE CHANGE POSITION ON A SCALE) and by defining frames and their roles within a hierarchy (see Figure 3).",
        "PropBank does not explicitly encode relationships among predicates.",
        "Most early work on frame-semantic parsing has made use of the exemplar sentences in the FrameNet corpus (see Section 3.1), each of which is annotated for a single frame and its arguments.",
        "Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) presented a discriminative model for arguments given the frame; Thompson, Levy, and Manning (2003) used a generative model for both the frame and its arguments.",
        "Fleischman, Kwon, and Hovy (2003) first used maximum entropy models to find and label arguments given the frame.",

        "(2006) introduced the Shalmaneser tool, which uses naive Bayes classifiers to do the same.",
        "Other FrameNet SRL systems (Giuglea and Moschitti 2006, for instance) have used SVMs.",
        "Most of this work was done on an older, smaller version of FrameNet, containing around 300 frames and fewer than 500 unique semantic roles.",
        "Unlike this body of work, we experimented with the larger SemEval 2007 shared task data set, and also the newer FrameNet 1.5,3 which lists 877 frames and 1,068 role types?thus handling many more labels, and resulting in richer frame-semantic parses.",
        "Recent work in frame-semantic parsing -- in which sentences may contain multiple frames which need to be recognized along with their arguments?was undertaken as the SemEval 2007 task 19 of frame-semantic structure extraction (Baker, Ellsworth, and Erk 2007).",
        "This task leveraged FrameNet 1.3, and also released a small corpus containing a little more than 2,000 sentences with full text annotations.",
        "The LTH system of Johansson and Nugues (2007), which we use as our baseline (Section 3.4), had the best performance in the SemEval 2007 task in terms of full frame-semantic parsing.",
        "Johansson and Nugues broke down the task as identifying targets that could evoke frames in a sentence, identifying the correct semantic frame for a target, and finally determining the arguments that fill the semantic roles of a frame.",
        "They used a series of SVMs to classify the frames for a given target, associating unseen lexical items to frames and identifying and classifying token spans as various semantic roles.",
        "Both the full text annotation corpus as well as the FrameNet exemplar sentences were used to train their models.",
        "Unlike Johansson and Nugues, we use only the full text annotated sentences as training data, model the whole problem with only two statistical models, and obtain significantly better overall parsing scores.",
        "We also model the argument identification problem using a joint structure prediction model and use semi-supervised learning to improve predicate coverage.",
        "We also present experiments on recently released FrameNet 1.5 data.",
        "In other work based on FrameNet, Matsubayashi, Okazaki, and Tsujii (2009) investigated various uses of FrameNet's taxonomic relations for learning generalizations over roles; they trained a log-linear model on the SemEval 2007 data to evaluate features for the subtask of argument identification.",
        "Another line of work has sought to extend the coverage of FrameNet by exploiting VerbNet and WordNet (Shi and Mihalcea 2005; Giuglea and Moschitti 2006; Pennacchiotti et al. 2008) and by projecting entries and annotations within and across languages (Boas 2002; Fung and Chen 2004; Pad√≥ and Lapata 2005; Fu?rstenau and Lapata 2009b).",
        "Others have explored the application of frame-semantic structures to tasks such as information extraction (Moschitti, Morarescu, and Harabagiu 2003; Surdeanu et al. 2003), textual entailment (Burchardt and Frank 2006; Burchardt et al. 2009), question answering (Narayanan and Harabagiu 2004; Shen and Lapata 2007), and paraphrase recognition (Pado?",
        "and Erk 2005).",
        "2.3 Semi-Supervised Methods Although there has been a significant amount of work in supervised shallow semantic parsing using both PropBank- and FrameNet-style representations, a few improvements over vanilla supervised methods using unlabeled data are notable.",
        "Fu?rstenau and Lapata (2009b) present a method of projecting predicate-argument structures from some seed examples to unlabeled sentences, and use a linear program formulation to find the best alignment explaining the projection.",
        "Next, the projected information as well as the seeds are used to train statistical model(s) for SRL.",
        "The authors ran experiments using a set of randomly chosen verbs from the exemplar sentences of FrameNet and found improvements over supervised methods.",
        "In an extension to this work, Fu?rstenau and Lapata (2009a) present a method for finding examples for unseen verbs using a graph alignment method; this method represents sentences and their syntactic analysis as graphs and graph alignment is used to project annotations from seed examples to unlabeled sentences.",
        "This alignment problem is again modeled as a linear program.",
        "Fu?rstenau and Lapata (2012) present an detailed expansion of the aforementioned papers.",
        "Although this line of work presents a novel direction in the area of SRL, the published approach does not yet deal with non-verbal predicates and does not evaluate the presented methods on the full text annotations of the FrameNet releases.",
        "Deschacht and Moens (2009) present a technique of incorporating additional information from unlabeled data by using a latent words language model.",
        "Latent variables are used to model the underlying representation of words, and parameters of this model 15  are estimated using standard unsupervised methods.",
        "Next, the latent information is used as features for an SRL model.",
        "Improvements over supervised SRL techniques are observed with the augmentation of these extra features.",
        "The authors also compare their method with the aforementioned two methods of Fu?rstenau and Lapata (2009a, 2009b) and show relative improvements.",
        "Experiments are performed on the CoNLL 2008 shared task data set (Surdeanu et al. 2008), which follows the PropBank conventions and only labels verbal and nominal predicates -- in contrast to our work, which includes most lexicosyntactic categories.",
        "A similar approach is presented by Weston, Ratle, and Collobert (2008), who use neural embeddings of words, which are eventually used for SRL; improvements over state-of-the-art PropBank-style SRL systems are observed.",
        "Recently, there has been related work in unsupervised semantic role labeling (Lang and Lapata 2010, 2011; Titov and Klementiev 2012) that attempts to induce semantic roles automatically from unannotated data.",
        "This line of work may be useful in discovering new semantic frames and roles, but here we stick to the concrete representation provided in FrameNet, without seeking to expand its inventory of semantic types.",
        "We present a new semi-supervised technique to expand the set of lexical items with the potential semantic frames that they could evoke; we use a graph-based semi-supervised learning framework to achieve this goal (Section 5.5).",
        "2.4 Joint Inference and Shallow Semantic Parsing Most high-performance SRL systems that use conventions from PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer 2002) and NomBank (Meyers et al. 2004) utilize joint inference for semantic role labeling (Ma`rquez et al. 2008).",
        "To our knowledge, the separate line of work investigating frame-semantic parsing has not previously dealt with joint inference.",
        "A common trait in prior work, both in PropBank and FrameNet conventions, has been the use of a two-stage model that identifies arguments first, then labels them, often using dynamic programming or integer linear programs (ILPs); we treat both problems together here.4 Recent work in natural language processing (NLP) problems has focused on ILP formulations for complex structure prediction tasks like dependency parsing (Riedel and Clarke 2006; Martins, Smith, and Xing 2009; Martins et al. 2010), sequence tagging (Roth and Yih 2004), as well as PropBank SRL (Punyakanok et al. 2004).",
        "Whereas early work in this area focused on declarative formulations tackled with off-the-shelf solvers, Rush et al. (2010) proposed subgradient-based dual decomposition (also called Lagrangian relaxation) as a way of exploiting the structure of the problem and existing combinatorial algorithms.",
        "The method allows the combination of models that are individually tractable, but not jointly tractable, by solving a relaxation of the original problem.",
        "Since then, dual decomposition has been used to build more accurate models for dependency parsing (Koo et al. 2010), combinatory categorical grammar supertagging and parsing (Auli and Lopez 2011), and machine translation (Chang and Collins 2011; DeNero and Macherey 2011; Rush and Collins 2011).",
        "Recently, Martins et al. (2011b) showed that the success of subgradient-based dual decomposition strongly relies on breaking down the original problem into a ?good? decomposition, that is, one with few overlapping components.",
        "4 In prior work, there are exceptions where identification and classification of arguments have been treated in one step; for more details, please refer to the systems participating in the CoNLL-2004 shared task on semantic role labeling (Carreras and Ma`rquez 2004).",
        "This leaves out many declarative constrained problems, for which such a good decomposition is not readily available.",
        "For those, Martins et al. proposed the Alternating Directions Dual Decomposition (AD3) algorithm, which retains the modularity of previous methods, but can handle thousands of small overlapping components.",
        "We adopt that algorithm as it perfectly suits the problem of argument identification, as we observe in Section 7.5 We also contribute an exact branch-and-bound technique wrapped around AD3.",
        "Before delving into the details of our modeling framework, we describe in detail the structure of the FrameNet lexicon and the data sets used to train our models.",
        "3.",
        "Resources and Task We consider frame-semantic parsing resources consisting of a lexicon and annotated sentences with frame-semantic structures, evaluation strategies, and previous baselines.",
        "3.1 FrameNet Lexicon The FrameNet lexicon is a taxonomy of manually identified general-purpose semantic frames for English.6 Listed in the lexicon with each frame are a set of lemmas (with parts of speech) that can denote the frame or some aspect of it?these are called lexical units (LUs).",
        "In a sentence, word or phrase tokens that evoke a frame are known as targets.",
        "The set of LUs listed for a frame in FrameNet may not be exhaustive; we may see a target in new data that does not correspond to an LU for the frame it evokes.",

        "3.3 Task and Evaluation Methodology Automatic annotations of frame-semantic structure can be broken into three parts: (1) targets, the words or phrases that evoke frames; (2) the frame type, defined in the lexicon, evoked by each target; and (3) the arguments, or spans of words that serve to fill roles defined by each evoked frame.",
        "These correspond to the three subtasks in our parser, each described and evaluated in turn: target identification (Section 4), frame identification (Section 5, not unlike word-sense disambiguation), and argument identification (Section 6, essentially the same as semantic role labeling).",
        "The standard evaluation script from the SemEval 2007 shared task calculates pre-cision, recall, and F1-measure for frames and arguments; it also provides a score that gives partial credit for hypothesizing a frame related to the correct one.",
        "We present 9 For creating the splits, we first included the documents that had incomplete annotations as mentioned in the initial FrameNet 1.5 data release in the test set; because we do not evaluate target identification for this version of data, the small number of targets per sentence does not matter.",
        "After these documents were put into the test set, we randomly selected 55 remaining documents for training, and picked the rest for additional testing.",
        "The final test set contains a total of 23 documents.",
        "When these documents are annotated in their entirety, the test set will become larger and the training set will be unaltered.",
        "19  precision, recall, and F1-measure microaveraged across the test documents, report labels-only matching scores (spans must match exactly), and do not use named entity labels.10 More details can be found in the task description paper from SemEval 2007 (Baker, Ellsworth, and Erk 2007).",
        "For our experiments, statistical significance is measured using a reimplementation of Dan Bikel's randomized parsing evaluation comparator, a stratified shuffling test whose original implementation11 is accompanied by the following description (quoted verbatim, with explanations of our use of the test given in square brackets): The null hypothesis is that the two models that produced the observed results are the same, such that for each test instance [here, a set of predicate-argument structures for a sentence], the two observed scores are equally likely.",
        "This null hypothesis is tested by randomly shuffling individual sentences?",
        "scores between the two models and then re-computing the evaluation metrics [precision, recall or F1 score in our case].",
        "If the difference in a particular metric after a shuffling is equal to or greater than the original observed difference in that metric, then a counter for that metric is incremented.",
        "Ideally, one would perform all 2n shuffles, where n is the number of test cases (sentences), but given that this is often prohibitively expensive, the default number of iterations is 10,000 [we use independently sampled 10,000 shuffles].",
        "After all iterations, the likelihood of incorrectly rejecting the null [hypothesis, i.e., the p-value] is simply (nc + 1)/(nt + 1), where nc is the number of random differences greater than the original observed difference, and nt is the total number of iterations.",
        "3.4 Baseline A strong baseline for frame-semantic parsing is the system presented by Johansson and Nugues (2007, hereafter J&N?07), the best system in the SemEval 2007 shared task.",
        "That system is based on a collection of SVMs.",
        "They used a set of rules for target identification which we describe in Appendix A.",
        "For frame identification, they used an SVM classifier to disambiguate frames for known frame-evoking words.",
        "They used WordNet synsets to extend the vocabulary of frame-evoking words to cover unknown words, and then used a collection of separate SVM classifiers?one for each frame?to predict a single evoked frame for each occurrence of a word in the extended set.",
        "J&N?07 followed Xue and Palmer (2004) in dividing the argument identification problem into two subtasks: First, they classified candidate spans as to whether they were arguments or not; then they assigned roles to those that were identified as arguments.",
        "Both phases used SVMs.",
        "Thus, their formulation of the problem involves a multitude of independently trained classifiers that share no information?whereas ours uses two log-linear models, each with a single set of parameters shared across all contexts, to find a full frame-semantic parse.",
        "We compare our models with J&N?07 using the benchmark data set from SemEval 2007.",
        "However, because we are not aware of any other work using the FrameNet 1.5 full text annotations, we report our results on that data set without comparison to any other system.",
        "10 For microaveraging, we concatenated all sentences of the test documents and measured precision and recall over the concatenation.",
        "Macroaveraging, on the other hand, would mean calculating these metrics for each document, then averaging them.",

        "11 See http://www.cis.upenn.edu/\u0002dbikel/software.html#comparator.",
        "Target Identification Target identification is the problem of deciding which word tokens (or word token sequences) evoke frames in a given sentence.",
        "In other semantic role labeling schemes (e.g., PropBank), simple part-of-speech criteria typically distinguish targets from non-targets.",
        "But in frame semantics, verbs, nouns, adjectives, and even prepositions can evoke frames under certain conditions.",
        "One complication is that semantically impoverished support predicates (such as make in make a request) do not evoke frames in the context of a frame-evoking, syntactically dependent noun (request).",
        "Furthermore, only temporal, locative, and directional senses of prepositions evoke frames.12 Preliminary experiments using a statistical method for target identification gave unsatisfactory results; instead, we followed J&N?07 in using a small set of rules to identify targets.",
        "First, we created a master list of all the morphological variants of targets that appear in the exemplar sentences and a given training set.",
        "For a sentence in new data, we considered as candidate targets only those substrings that appear in this master list.",
        "We also did not attempt to capture discontinuous frame targets: for example, we treat there would have been as a single span even though the corresponding LU is there be.V.13 Next, we pruned the candidate target set by applying a series of rules identical to the ones described by Johansson and Nugues (2007, see Appendix A), with two exceptions.",
        "First, they identified locative, temporal, and directional prepositions using a dependency parser so as to retain them as valid LUs.",
        "In contrast, we pruned all types of prepositions because we found them to hurt our performance on the development set due to errors in syntactic parsing.",
        "In a second departure from their target extraction rules, we did not remove the candidate targets that had been tagged as support verbs for some other target.",
        "Note that we used a conservative white list that filters out targets whose morphological variants were not seen either in the lexicon or the training data.14 Therefore, when this conservative process of automatic target identification is used, our system loses the capability to predict frames for completely unseen LUs, despite the fact that our powerful frame identification model (Section 5) can accurately label frames for new LUs.15 Results.",
        "Table 3 shows results on target identification tested on the SemEval 2007 test set; our system gains 3 F1 points over the baseline.",

        "A considerable proportion of these units have more than 12 Note that there have been dedicated shared tasks to determine relationships between nominals (Girju et al. 2007) and word-sense disambiguation of prepositions (Litkowski and Hargraves 2007), but we do not build specific models for predicates of these categories.",
        "13 There are 629 multiword LUs in the lexicon, and they correspond to 4.8% of the targets in the training set; among them are screw up.V, shoot the breeze.V, and weapon of mass destruction.N.",
        "In the SemEval 2007 training data, there are just 99 discontinuous multiword targets (1% of all targets).",
        "14 This conservative approach violates theoretical linguistic assumptions about frame-evoking targets as governed by frame semantics.",
        "It also goes against the spirit of using linguistic constraints to improve the separate subtask of argument identification (see Section 7); however, due to varying distributions of target annotations, high empirical error in identifying locative, temporal, and directional prepositions, and support verbs, we resorted to this aggressive filtering heuristic to avoid making too many target identification mistakes.",

        "Our frame identification model thus performs on par with the previous state of the art for this task, and offers several advantages over J&N's formulation of the problem: It requires only a single model, learns lexical-semantic features as part of that model rather than requiring a preprocessing step to expand the vocabulary of frame-evoking words, and is probabilistic, which can facilitate global reasoning.",

        "This suggests that the hidden variable model helps in identifying related (but rarely exact) frames for unseen targets, and explains why under exact?but not partial?frame matching, the F1 score using automatic targets is commensurate with the score for oracle targets.26 For automatically identified targets, the F1 score falls because the model fails to predict frames for unseen lemmas.",

        "An immediate effect of this choice is a blow-up in the number of features; we must instantiate features (see Table 4) for all 4,194 unique targets observed in training.",
        "Because each of these features needs to be associated with all 877 frames in the partition function of Equation (2), the result is an 80-fold blowup of the feature space (the latent variable model had 465,317 features).",
        "Such a model is not computationally feasible in our engineering framework, so we considered a model using only features observed to fire at some point in the training data (called ?supported?",

        "We found that relaxation was tight 99.8% of the time on the test examples.",
        "The example in Figure 1 is taken from our test set, and shows an instance where two roles, Partner 1 and Partner 2, share the ?requires?",
        "relationship; for this example, the beam search decoder misses the Partner 2 role, which is a violation, while our AD3 decoder identifies both arguments correctly.",
        "Note that beam search makes plenty of linguistic violations.",
        "We found that beam search, when violating many ?requires?",
        "constraints, often finds one role in the pair, which increases its recall.",
        "AD3 is sometimes more conservative in such cases, predicting neither role.",
        "Figure 6 shows such an example where beam search finds one role (Partner 1) while AD3 is more conservative and predicts no roles.",
        "Figure 7 shows another example contrasting the output of beam search and AD3 where the former predicts two roles sharing an ?excludes?",
        "relationship; AD3 does not violate this constraint and tries to predict a more consistent argument set.",
        "Overall, we found it interesting that imposing the constraints did not have much effect on standard measures of accuracy.",
        "Table 9 only shows results with gold frames.",
        "We ran the exact version of AD3 with automatic frames as well.",
        "When the semi-supervised graph objective UJSF-\u00021,2 is used for frame identification, the performance with AD3 is only a bit worse in comparison with beam search (row 11 in Table 8) when frame and argument identification are evaluated together.",
        "We get a precision of 72.92, a recall of 65.22 and an F1 score of 68.86 (partial frame matching).",
        "Again, all linguistic constraints are respected, unlike beam search.",
        "47  8.",
        "Conclusion We have presented an approach to rich frame-semantic parsing, based on a combination of knowledge from FrameNet, two probabilistic models trained on full text annotations released along with the FrameNet lexicon, and expedient heuristics.",
        "The frame identification model uses latent variables in order to generalize to predicates unseen in either the FrameNet lexicon or training data, and our results show that, quite often, this model chooses a frame closely related to the gold-standard annotation.",
        "We also presented an extension of this model that uses graph-based semi-supervised learning to better generalize to new predicates; this achieves significant improvements over the fully supervised approach.",
        "Our argument identification model, trained using maximum conditional log-likelihood, unifies the traditionally separate steps of detecting and (a) Gold annotation.",
        "(b) Beam search output.",
        "(c) AD3 output.",
        "Figure 7 An example from the test set where (a) exhibits the gold annotation for a target that evokes the DISCUSSION frame, with the Interlocutor 1 role filled by the span neighbors.",
        "(b) shows the prediction made by the beam search decoding scheme (beam = 10,000), where it marks The next morning his households and neighbors with the Interlocutors role, which violates the ?excludes?",
        "constraint with respect to the Interlocutor 2 role.",
        "In (c), AD3 marks the wrong span as the Interlocutor 1 role, but it does not violate the constraint.",
        "Both beam and AD3 inference miss the Topic role.",
        "labeling arguments.",
        "Our system achieves improvements over the previous state of the art on the SemEval 2007 benchmark data set at each stage of processing and collectively.",
        "We also report stronger results on the more recent, larger FrameNet 1.5 release.",
        "We applied the AD3 algorithm to collective prediction of a target's arguments, incorporating declarative linguistic knowledge as constraints.",
        "It outperforms the naive local decoding scheme that is oblivious to the constraints.",
        "Furthermore, it is significantly faster than a decoder employing a state-of-the-art proprietary solver; it is only twice as slow as beam search (our chosen decoding method for comparison with the state of the art), which is inexact and does not respect all linguistic constraints.",
        "This method is easily amenable to the inclusion of additional constraints.",
        "From our results, we observed that in comparison to the SemEval 2007 data set, frame-semantic parsing performance significantly increases when we use the FrameNet 1.5 release; this suggests that the increase in the number of full text annotations and the size of the FrameNet lexicon is beneficial.",
        "We believe that with more annotations in the future (say, in the range of the number of PropBank annotations), our frame-semantic parser can reach even better accuracy, making it more useful for NLP applications that require semantic analysis.",
        "There are several open problems to be addressed.",
        "Firstly, we could further improve the coverage of the frame-semantic parser by improving our semi-supervised learning approach; two possibilities are custom metric learning approaches (Dhillon, Talukdar, and Crammer 2010) that suit the frame identification problem in graph-based SSL, and sparse word representations (Turian, Ratinov, and Bengio 2010) as features in frame identification.",
        "The argument identification model might also benefit from semi-supervised learning.",
        "Further feature engineering and improved preprocessing, including tokenization into lexical units, improved syntactic parsing, and the use of external knowledge bases, is expected to improve the system's accuracy.",
        "Finally, the FrameNet lexicon does not contain exhaustive semantic knowledge.",
        "Automatic frame and role induction is an exciting direction of future research that could further enhance our methods of automatic frame-semantic parsing.",
        "The parser described in this article is available for download at http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/SEMAFOR.",
        "Appendix A.",
        "Target Identification Heuristics from J&N?07 We describe here the filtering rules that Johansson and Nugues (2007) used for identifying frame evoking targets in their SemEval 2007 shared task paper.",
        "They built a filtering component based on heuristics that removed words that appear in certain contexts, and kept the remaining ones.45 These are: \u0002 have was retained only if had an object, \u0002 be was retained only if it was preceded by there, \u0002 will was removed in its modal sense, \u0002 of course and in particular were removed, 45 Although not explicitly mentioned in the paper, we believe that these rules were applied on a white list of potential targets seen in FrameNet and the SemEval 2007 training data.",
        "49  \u0002 the prepositions above, against, at, below, beside, by, in, on, over, and under were removed unless their head was marked as locative, \u0002 after and before were removed unless their head was marked as temporal, \u0002 into, to, and through were removed unless their head was marked as direction, \u0002 as, for, so, and with were always removed, \u0002 because the only sense of the word of was the frame PARTITIVE, it was removed unless it was preceded by only, member, one, most, many, some, few, part, majority, minority, proportion, half, third, quarter, all, or none, or it was followed by all, group, them, or us, \u0002 all targets marked as support verbs for some other target were removed.",
        "Note that J&N?07 used a syntactic parser that provided dependency labels corresponding to locative, temporal, and directional arguments, which our syntactic parser of choice (the MST parser) does not provide.",
