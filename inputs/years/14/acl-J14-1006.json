        "Background: The MSA/Dialect Distinction in Arabic Although the Arabic language has an official status in over 20 countries and is spoken by more than 250 million people, the term itself is used rather loosely and refers to different varieties of the language.",
        "Arabic is characterized by an interesting linguistic dichotomy: the written form of the language, MSA, differs in a non-trivial fashion from the various spoken varieties of Arabic, each of which is a regional dialect (or a lahjah, lit.",
        "?accent?",
        "; also darjah, lit.",
        "?modern?).",
        "MSA is the only variety that is standardized, regulated, and taught in schools.",
        "This is necessitated because of its use in written communication in formal venues.",
        "The regional dialects, used primarily for day-to-day dealings and spoken communication, are not taught formally in schools, and remain somewhat absent from traditional, and certainly official, written communication.",
        "1 The term MSA is used primarily by linguists and in educational settings.",
        "For example, constitutions of countries where Arabic is an official language simply refer to The Arabic Language, the reference to the standard form of Arabic being implicit.",
        "172 Zaidan and Callison-Burch Arabic Dialect Identification Unlike MSA, a regional dialect does not have an explicit written set of grammar rules regulated by an authoritative organization, but there is certainly a concept of grammatical and ungrammatical.2 Furthermore, even though they are ?spoken?",
        "varieties, it is certainly possible to produce dialectal Arabic text, by spelling out words using the same spelling rules used in MSA, which are mostly phonetic.",
        "There is a reasonable level of mutual intelligibility across the dialects, but the extent to which a particular individual is able to understand other dialects depends heavily on that person's own dialect and their exposure to Arab culture and literature from outside of their own country.",
        "For example, the typical Arabic speaker has little trouble understanding the Egyptian dialect, thanks in no small part to Egypt's history in movie-making and television show production, and their popularity across the Arab world.",
        "On the other hand, the Moroccan dialect, especially in its spoken form, is quite difficult to understand by a Levantine speaker.",
        "Therefore, from a scientific point of view, the dialects can be considered separate languages in their own right, much like North Germanic languages (Norwegian/Swedish/Danish) and West Slavic languages (Czech/Slovak/Polish).4 2.1 The Dialectal Varieties of Arabic One possible breakdown of regional dialects into main groups is as follows (see Figure 1): \u0002 Egyptian: The most widely understood dialect, due to a thriving Egyptian television and movie industry, and Egypt's highly influential role in the region for much of the 20th century (Haeri 2003).",
        "\u0002 Levantine: A set of dialects that differ somewhat in pronunciation and intonation, but are largely equivalent in written form; closely related to Aramaic (Bassiouney 2009).",
        "\u0002 Gulf: Folk wisdom holds that Gulf is the closest of the regional dialect to MSA, perhaps because the current form of MSA evolved from an Arabic variety originating in the Gulf region.",
        "Although there are major differences between Gulf and MSA, Gulf has notably preserved more of MSA's verb conjugation than other varieties have (Versteegh 2001).",
        "2 There exist resources that describe grammars and dictionaries of many Arabic dialects (e.g., Abdel-Massih, Abdel-Malek, and Badawi 1979; Badawi and Hinds 1986; Cowell 1964; Erwin 1963; Ingham 1994; Holes 2004), but these are compiled by individual linguists as one-off efforts, rather than updated regularly by central regulatory organizations, as is the case with MSA and many other world languages.",
        "3 Arabic speakers writing in dialectal Arabic mostly follow MSA spelling rules in cases where MSA is not strictly phonetic as well (e.g., the pronunciation of the definite article Al).",
        "Habash, Diab, and Rambow (2012) have proposed CODA, a Conventional Orthography for Dialectal Arabic, to standardize the spelling of Arabic dialect computational models.",
        "4 Note that such a view is not widely accepted by Arabic speakers, who hold MSA in high regard.",
        "They consider dialects, including their own, to be simply imperfect, even ?corrupted,?",
        "versions of MSA, rather than separate languages (Suleiman 1994).",
        "One exception might be the Egyptian dialect, where a nationalistic movement gave rise to such phenomena as the Egyptian Wikipedia, with articles written exclusively in Egyptian, and little, if any, MSA.",
        "Another notable exception is the Lebanese poet Said Akl, who spearheaded an effort to recognize Lebanese as an independent language, and even proposed a Latin-based Lebanese alphabet.",
        "173  Figure 1 One possible breakdown of spoken Arabic into dialect groups: Maghrebi, Egyptian, Levantine, Gulf, and Iraqi.",
        "Habash (2010) and Versteegh (2001) give a breakdown along mostly the same lines.",
        "Note that this is a relatively coarse breakdown, and further division of the dialect groups is possible, especially in large regions such as the Maghreb.",
        "\u0002 Iraqi: Sometimes considered to be one of the Gulf dialects, though it has distinctive features of its own in terms of prepositions, verb conjugation, and pronunciation (Mitchell 1990).",
        "\u0002 Maghrebi: Heavily influenced by the French and Berber languages.",
        "The Western-most varieties could be unintelligible by speakers from other regions in the Middle East, especially in spoken form.",
        "The Maghreb is a large region with more variation than is seen in other regions such as the Levant and the Gulf, and could be subdivided further (Mohand 1999).",
        "There are a large number of linguistic differences between MSA and the regional dialects.",
        "Some of those differences do not appear in written form if they are on the level of short vowels, which are omitted in Arabic text anyway.",
        "That said, many differences manifest themselves textually as well: \u0002 MSA's morphology is richer than dialects?",
        "along some dimensions such as case and mood.",
        "For instance, MSA has a dual form in addition to the singular and plural forms, whereas the dialects mostly lack the dual form.",
        "Also, MSA has two plural forms, one masculine and one feminine, whereas many (though not all) dialects often make no such gendered distinction.5 On the other hand, dialects have a more complex cliticization system than MSA, allowing for circumfix negation, and for attached pronouns to act as indirect objects.",
        "\u0002 Dialects lack grammatical case, whereas MSA has a complex case system.",
        "In MSA, most cases are expressed with diacritics that are rarely explicitly written, with the accusative case being a notable exception, as it is expressed using a suffix (+A) in addition to a diacritic (e.g., on objects and adverbs).",
        "5 Dialects may preserve the dual form for nouns, but often lack it in verb conjugation and pronouns, using plural forms instead.",
        "The same is true for the gendered plural forms, which exist for many nouns (e.g., ?teachers?",
        "is either m?lmyn [male] or m?lmAt [female]), but not used otherwise as frequently as in MSA.",
        "174 Zaidan and Callison-Burch Arabic Dialect Identification \u0002 There are lexical choice differences in the vocabulary itself.",
        "Table 1 gives several examples.",
        "Note that these differences go beyond a lack of orthography standardization.",
        "\u0002 Differences in verb conjugation, even when the triliteral root is preserved.",
        "See the lower part of Table 1 for some conjugations of the root s?-r-b (to drink).",
        "This list, and Table 1, deal with differences that are expressed at the inidividual-word level.",
        "It is important to note that Arabic varieties differ markedly in style and sentence composition as well.",
        "For instance, all varieties of Arabic, MSA, and otherwise, allow both SVO and VSO word orders, but MSA has a higher incidence of VSO sentences than dialects do (Aoun, Benmamoun, and Sportiche 1994; Shlonsky 1997).",
        "2.2 Existing Arabic Data Sources Despite the fact that speakers are usually less comfortable communicating in MSA than in their own dialect, MSA content significantly dominates dialectal content, as MSA is the variant of choice for formal and official communication.",
        "Relatively little printed material exists in local dialects, such as folkloric literature and some modern poetry, but the vast majority of published Arabic is in MSA.",
        "As a result, MSA's dominance is also apparent in data sets available for linguistic research.",
        "The problem is somewhat mitigated in the speech domain, since dialectal data exists in the form of phone conversations and television program recordings, but, in general, dialectal Arabic data sets are hard to come by.",
        "Table 1 A few examples illustrating similarities and differences across MSA and three Arabic dialects: Levantine, Gulf, and Egyptian.",
        "Even when a word is spelled the same across two or more varieties, the pronunciation might differ due to differences in short vowels (which are not spelled out).",
        "Also, due to the lack of orthography standardization, and variance in pronunciation even within a single dialect, some dialectal words could have more than one spelling (e.g., Egyptian ?I drink?",
        "could be bAs?rb, Levantine ?He drinks?",
        "could be bys?rb).",

        "For example, most words of the dialectal sentence shown in Figure 2 are transliterated, whereas an equivalent MSA sentence is handled quite well.",

        "Case in point, the system is unable to consistently handle any of Ayh (?what?",
        "), Ally (the conjunction ?that?",
        "), or dh (?this?).",
        "Granted, it is conceivable that processing dialectal content is more difficult than MSA, but the main problem is the lack of dialectal training data.6 This is an important point to take into consideration, because the dialects differ to a large enough extent to warrant treating them as more or less different languages.",

        "has been trained exclusively on MSA data is similar to the behavior of a Spanish-to-English MT system when a user inputs a Portuguese sentence.",
        "Figure 4 illustrates how MT systems behave (the analogy is not intended to draw a parallel between the linguistic differences MSA-dialect and Spanish-Portuguese).",
        "The MT system's behavior is similar to the Arabic example, in that words that are shared in common between Spanish and Portuguese are translated, while the Portuguese words that were never observed in the Spanish training data are left untranslated.",
        "This example illustrates the need for dialectal data to train MT systems to handle dialectal content properly.",
        "A similar scenario would arise with many other NLP tasks, such as parsing or speech recognition, where dialectal content would be needed in large quantities for adequate training.",
        "A robust dialect identifier could sift through immense volumes of Arabic text, and separate out dialectal content from MSA content.",
        "2.3 Harvesting Dialect Data from On-line Social Media One domain of written communication in which MSA and dialectal Arabic are both commonly used is the on-line domain, because it is more individual-driven and less institutionalized than other venues.",
        "This makes a dialect much more likely to be the user's language of choice, and dialectal Arabic has a strong presence in blogs, fo-rums, chatrooms, and user/reader commentary.",
        "Therefore, on-line data is a valuable resource of dialectal Arabic text, and harvesting this data is a viable option for computational linguists for purposes of creating large data sets to be used in statistical learning.",

        "In its simplest form, the task is to build a learner that can, given an Arabic sentence S, determine whether or not S contains dialectal content.",
        "Another form of the task would be to determine in which dialect S was written, which requires identification at a more fine-grained level.",

        "We discuss prior efforts for Arabic DID in Section 7.",
        "3.1 The Difficulty of Arabic DID Despite the differences illustrated in the previous section, in which we justify treating the different dialects as separate languages, it is not a trivial matter to automatically distinguish and separate the dialects from each other.",
        "Because all Arabic varieties use the same character set, and because much of the vocabulary is shared among different varieties, identifying dialect in a sentence is not simply a matter of, say, compiling a dialectal dictionary and detecting whether or not a given sentence contains dialectal words.",

        "Each of the sentences in Figure 5 consists 178 Zaidan and Callison-Burch Arabic Dialect Identification of words that are used both in MSA and dialectally, and an MSA-based dictionary would not (and should not) recognize those words as out of vocabulary (OOV).",

        "(This is similar to the English usage of okay.)",
        "\u0002 Primarily due to the omission of short vowels, a dialectal word might have the same spelling as an MSA word with an entirely different meaning, forming pairs of heteronyms.",

        "It might not be clear for a non-Arabic speaker what makes certain sentences, such as those of Figure 5, dialectal, even when none of the individual words are.",
        "The answer lies in the structure of such sentences and the particular word order within them, rather than the individual words themselves taken in isolation.",
        "Figure 6 shows MSA sentences that express the same meaning as the dialectal sentences from Figure 5.",
        "As one could see, the two versions of any given sentence could share much of the vocabulary, but in ways that are noticeably different to an Arabic speaker.",
        "Furthermore, the differences would be starker still if the MSA sentences were composed from scratch, rather than by modifying the dialectal sentences, since the tone might differ substantially when composing sentences in MSA.",
        "Figure 5 Three sentences that were identified by our annotators as dialectical, even thought they do not contain individually dialectal words.",
        "A word-based OOV-detection approach would fail to classify these sentences as being dialectal, because all these words could appear in an MSA corpus.",

        "179  Figure 6 The dialectal sentences of Figure 5, with MSA equivalents.",
        "3.2 Applications of Dialect Identification Being able to perform automatic DID is interesting from a purely linguistic and experimental point of view.",
        "In addition, automatic DID has several useful applications: \u0002 Distinguishing dialectal data from non-dialectal data would aid in creating a large monolingual dialectal data set, exactly as we would hope to do with the AOC data set.",
        "Such a data set would aid many NLP systems that deal with dialectal content, for instance, to train a language model for an Arabic dialect speech recognition system (Novotney, Schwartz, and Khudanpur 2011).",
        "Identifying dialectal content can also aid in creating parallel data sets for machine translation, with a dialectal source side.",
        "\u0002 A user might be interested in content of a specific dialect, or, conversely, in strictly non-dialectal content.",
        "This would be particularly relevant in fine-tuning and personalizing search engine results, and could allow for better user-targeted advertising.",
        "In the same vein, being able to recognize dialectal content in user-generated text could aid in characterizing communicants and their biographic attributes (Garera and Yarowsky 2009).",
