        "However, computing an inside probability for each node, as in the first phase of the algorithm of Johnson, Griffiths, and Goldwater (2007), becomes difficult because of the exponential number of TSG rules that can apply at any node in the forest.",
        "Not only is the number of possible TSG rules that can apply given a fixed tree structure exponentially large in the size of the tree, but the number of possible tree structures under a node is also exponentially large.",
        "This problem is particularly acute during grammar learning, as opposed to sampling according to a fixed grammar, because any tree fragment is a valid potential rule.",

        "In general, algorithms that match all possible rules are likely to be prohibitively slow, as well as unwieldy to implement.",
        "In this article, we design a sampling algorithm that avoids explicitly computing inside probabilities for each node in the forest.",

        "We avoid computing inside probabilities, as in the TSG sampling algorithms of Cohn, Goldwater, and Blunsom (2009) and Post and Gildea (2009), but we must correct for the bias introduced by the forest structure, a complication that does not arise when the tree structure is fixed.",
        "In order to simplify the presentation of the algorithm, we first set aside the complication of large, TSG-style rules, and describe an algorithm for sampling trees from forests while avoiding computation of inside probabilities.",

        "We make the assumption that the alignments produced by a word-level model are correct in order to simplify the computation necessary for rule learning.",

        "Our naive algorithm has failed at its goal of sampling among the five possible trees each with probability 1/5.",
        "Thus, we cannot adopt the simple Gibbs sampling strategy, used for TSG induction from fixed trees, of resampling one variable at a time according to the target distribution, conditioned on all other variables.",
        "The intuitive reason for this, as illustrated by the example, is the bias introduced by forests that are bushier (that is, havemore derivations for each node) in some parts than in others.",

        "Word alignment is most often performed using the models of Brown et al. (1993) and Vogel, Ney, and Tillmann (1996).",
        "Phrase extraction is performed differently for phrase-based (Koehn, Och, and Marcu 2003), hierarchical (Chiang 2005), and syntax-based (Galley et al. 2004) translation models, whereas tuning algorithms are generally independent of the translation model (Och 2003; Chiang, Marton, and Resnik 2008; Hopkins and May 2011).",
        "Recently, a number of efforts have been made to combine the word alignment and rule extraction steps into a joint model, with the hope both of avoiding some of the errors of the word-level alignment, and of automatically learning the decomposition of sentence pairs into rules (DeNero, Bouchard-Cote, and Klein 2008; Blunsom et al. 2009; Blunsom and Cohn 2010a; Neubig et al. 2011).",
        "This approach treats both word alignment and rule decomposition as hidden variables in an EM-style algorithm.",
        "While these efforts have been able to match the performance of systems based on two successive steps for word alignment and rule extraction, they have generally not improved performance enough to become widely adopted.",
        "One possible reason for this is the added complexity and in particular the increased computation time when compared to the standard pipeline.",
        "The accuracy of word-level alignments from the standard GIZA++ package has proved hard to beat, in particular when large amounts of training data are available.",
        "Given this state of affairs, the question arises whether static word alignments can be used to guide rule learning in a model which treats the decomposition of a sentence pair into rules as a hidden variable.",
        "Such an approach would favor rules which are consistent with the other sentences in the data, and would contrast with the standard practice inHiero-style systems of simply extracting all overlapping rules consistent with static word alignments.",
        "Constraining the search over rule decomposition with word alignments has the potential to significantly speed up training of rule decomposition models, overcoming one of the barriers to their widespread use.",
        "Rule decomposition models also have the benefit of producing much smaller grammars than are achieved when extracting all possible rules.",
        "This is desirable given that the size of translation grammars is one of the limiting computational factors in current systems, necessitating elaborate strategies for rule filtering and indexing.",
        "In this section, we apply our sampling algorithm to learn rules for the Hiero translation model of Chiang (2005).",
        "Hiero is based on SCFG, with a number of constraints on the form that rules can take.",
        "The grammar has a single nonterminal, and each rule has 220 Chung et al. Sampling Tree Fragments from Forests at most two right-hand side nonterminals.",
        "Most significantly, Hiero allows rules with mixed terminals and nonterminals on the right-hand side.",
        "This has the great benefit of allowing terminals to control re-ordering between languages, but also leads to very large numbers of valid rules during the rule extraction process.",
        "We wish to see whether, by adding a learned model of sentence decomposition to Hiero's original method of leveraging fixed word-level alignments, we can learn a small set of rules in a system that is both efficient to train and efficient to decode.",
        "Our approach of beginning with fixed word alignments is similar to that of Sankaran, Haffari, and Sarkar (2011), although their sampling algorithm reanalyzes individual phrases extracted with Hiero heuristics rather than entire sentences, and produces rules with no more than one nonterminal on the right-hand side.",
        "Most previous works on joint word alignment and rule extraction models were evaluated indirectly by resorting to heuristic methods to extract rules from learned word alignment or bracketing structures (DeNero, Bouchard-Cote, and Klein 2008; Zhang et al. 2008; Blunsom et al. 2009; Levenberg, Dyer, and Blunsom 2012), and do not directly learn the SCFG rules that are used during decoding.",
        "In this article, we work with lexicalized translation rules with a mix of terminals and nonterminals, and we use the rules found by our sampler directly for decoding.",
        "Because word alignments are fixed in our model, any improvements we observe in translation quality indicate that our model learns how SCFG rules interplay with each other, rather than fixing word alignment errors.",
        "The problem of rule decomposition is not only relevant to the Hiero model.",
        "Translation models that make use of monolingual parsing, such as string-to-tree (Galley et al. 2004), and tree-to-string (Liu, Liu, and Lin 2006), are all known to benefit greatly from learning composed rules (Galley et al. 2006).",
        "In the particular case of Hiero rule extraction, although there is no explicit rule composition step, the extracted rules are in fact ?composed rules?",
        "in the sense of string-to-tree or tree-to-string rule extraction, because they can be further decomposed into smaller SCFG rules that are also consistent with word alignments.",
        "Although our experiments only include the Hiero model, the method presented in this article is also applicable to string-to-tree and tree-to-string models, because the phrase decomposition forest presented in Section 3 can be extended to rule learning and extraction of other syntax-based MT models.",
        "5.2 Model In this section, we describe a generative model based on the Pitman-Yor process (Pitman and Yor 1997; Teh 2006) over derivation trees consisting of composed rules.",
        "Bayesian methods have been applied to a number of segmentation tasks in natural language pro-cessing, including word segmentation, TSG learning, and learning machine translation rules, as a way of controlling the overfitting produced when Expectation Maximization would tend to prefer longer segments.",
        "However, it is important to note that the Bayesian priors in most cases control the size and number of the clusters, but do not explicitly control the size of rules.",
        "In many cases, this type of Bayesian prior alone is not strong enough to overcome the preference for longer, less generalizable rules.",
        "For example, some previous work in word segmentation (Liang and Klein 2009; Naradowsky and Toutanova 2011) adopts a ?length penalty?",
        "to remedy this situation.",
        "Because we have the prior knowledge that longer rules are less likely to generalize and are therefore less likely to be a good rule, we adopt a similar scheme to control the length of rules in our model.",
        "221  In order to explicitly control the length of our rules, we generate a rule r in two stages.",
        "First, we draw the length of a rule |r| = \u0005 from a probability distribution defined over positive integers.",
        "We use a Poisson distribution: P(\u0005; ?)",
        "= ?",
        "\u0004e??",
        "\u0005!",
        "Because of the factorial in the denominator, the Poisson distribution decays quickly as \u0005 becomes larger, which is ideal for selecting rule length because we want to encourage learning of shorter rules and learn longer rules only when there is strong evidence for them in the data.",
        "A separate Pitman-Yor process is defined for the rules of each length \u0005.",
        "We draw the rule distribution G from a Pitman-Yor process, and then rules of length \u0005 are drawn from G. G | ?, d,P0 ?",
        "PY(?, d,P0) r | G ?",
        "G The first two parameters, a concentration parameter ?",
        "and a discount parameter d, control the shape of distribution G by controlling the size and the number of clusters.",
        "The label of the cluster is decided by the base distribution P0.",
        "Because our alignment is fixed, we do not need a complex base distribution that differentiates better aligned phrases from others.",
        "We use a uniform distribution where each rule of the same size has equal probability.",
        "Since the number of possible shorter rules is smaller than that of longer rules, we need to reflect this fact and need to have larger uniform probability for shorter rules and smaller uniform probability for longer rules.",
        "We reuse the Poisson probability for the base distribution, essentially assuming that the number of possible rules of length \u0005 is 1/P(\u0005; ?).",
        "The Pitman-Yor process gives us the following probability of choosing r of size \u0005 given the current analysis z?i of the data: P(ri = r | \u0005, z?i) = nr ?",
        "Trd + (T\u0004d + ?",
        ")P0(r) n\u0004 + ?",
        "where nr is the number of times rule r has been observed in z?i, Tr is the number of tables (in the Chinese restaurant metaphor) labeled r, and n\u0004 is the total number of rules of length \u0005 observed in z?i.",
        "Because we have drawn the length of the rule from a Poisson distribution, the rule length probability is multiplied by this equation in order to obtain the probability of the rule under our model.",
        "Keeping track of table assignments during inference requires a lot of book-keeping.",
        "In order to simplify the implementation, instead of explicitly keeping track of the number of tables for each rule, we estimate the number of tables using the following equations (Huang and Renals 2010): Tr = ndr T\u0004 = ?",
        "r:|r|=\u0004 ndr 222 Chung et al. Sampling Tree Fragments from Forests In order to encourage learning rules with smaller parsing complexity and rules with mixed terminals and nonterminals, which are useful for replicating re-orderings that are seen in the data, we made use of the concept of scope (Hopkins and Langmead 2010) in our definition of rule length.",
        "The scope of a rule is defined as the number of pairs of adjacent nonterminals in the source language right-hand side plus the number of nonterminals at the beginning or end of the source language right-hand side.",
        "For example, X ?",
        "f1X1X2f2X3, X1e1X2X3e2 has scope 2 because X1 and X2 are adjacent in the source language and X3 is at the end of the source language right-hand side.",
        "The target side of the rule is irrelevant.",
        "The intuition behind this definition is that it measures the number of free indices into the source language string required during parsing, under the assumption that the terminals provide fixed anchor points into the string.",
        "Thus a rule of scope of k can be parsed in O(nk).",
        "We define the length of a rule to be the number of terminals in the source and the target side plus the scope of the rule.",
        "This is equivalent to counting the total number of symbols in the rule, but only counting a nonterminal if it contributes to parsing complexity.",
        "For example, the length of a rule that consists only of two consecutive nonterminals would be 3, and the length of a rule that has two consecutive nonterminals bounded by terminals on both sides would be 3 as well.",
        "This definition of rule length encourages rules with mixed terminals and nonterminals over rules with only nonterminals, which tend not to provide useful guidance to the translation process during decoding.",
        "5.3 Stratified Sampling We follow the same Gibbs sampler introduced in Section 4.2.",
        "The SAMPLEEDGE operation in our Gibbs sampler can be a relatively expensive operation, because the entire subtree under a node is being changed during sampling.",
        "We observe that in a phrase decomposition forest, lexicalized rules, which are crucial to translation quality, appear at the bottom level of the forest.",
        "This lexicalized information propagates up the forest as rules get composed.",
        "It is reasonable to constrain initial sampling iterations to work only on those bottom level nodes, and then gradually lift the constraint.",
        "This not only makes the sampler much more efficient, but also gives it a chance to focus on getting better estimates of the more important parameters, before starting to consider nodes at higher levels, which correspond to rules of larger size.",
        "Fortunately, as mentioned in Section 3, each node in a phrase decomposition forest already has a unique level, with level 1 nodes corresponding to minimal phrase pairs.",
        "We design the sampler to use a stratified sampling process (i.e., sampling level one nodes for K iterations, then level 1 and 2 nodes for K iterations, and so on).",
        "We emphasize that when we sample for level 2 nodes, level 1 nodes are also sampled, which means parameters for the smaller rules are given more chance to mix, and thereby settle into a more stable distribution.",
        "In our experiments, running the first 100 iterations of sampling with regular sampling techniques took us about 18 hours.",
        "However, with stratified sampling, it took only about 6 hours.",
        "We also compared translation quality as measured by decoding with rules from the 100th sample, and by averaging over every 10th sample.",
        "Both sampling methods gave us roughly the same translation quality as measured in BLEU.",
        "We therefore used stratified sampling throughout our experiments.",
        "223  5.4 Experiments We used a Chinese?English parallel corpus available from LDC,1 composed of newswire text.",
