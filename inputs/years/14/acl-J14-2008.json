        "A good portion of NER research is devoted to the study of English, due to its significance as a dominant language that is used internationally for communications, science, information technology, business, seafaring, aviation, entertainment, and diplomacy.",
        "This has limited the diversity of text genre and domain factors from other languages that are usually considered when developing NER for these fields.",
        "For instance, as most scientific studies are conducted in English in almost all Arabic-speaking countries, there is no urgency to investigate Arabic NER for areas such as bioinformatics, drug, or chemical named entities.",
        "NER can be defined as the task that attempts to locate, extract, and automatically classify named entities into predefined classes or types in open-domain and unstructured texts, such as newspaper articles (Nadeau and Sekine 2007).",
        "One obvious reason for the importance of named entities is their pervasiveness, which is evidenced by the high frequency, including occurrence and co-occurrence, of named entities in corpora (cf. Saravanan et al. 2012).",
        "Arabic is a language of rich morphology and syntax.",
        "Its characteristics and peculiarities make dealing with it a challenge (Farghaly and Shaalan 2009).",
        "The last decade has shown a growing interest in addressing challenges that underlie the development of a productive and robust Arabic NER system (Al-Jumaily et al. 2012; Oudah and Shaalan 2012).",
        "This article investigates the progress in Arabic NER research.",
        "The survey byNadeau and Sekine (2007) presents background on much of the work on NER for a variety of languages and myriad machine learning (ML) techniques.",
        "To the best of our knowl-edge, Arabic NER and classification have not yet been surveyed extensively, which has motivated us to conduct this survey.",
        "The survey is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 provides background information relevant for working with Arabic NER.",

        "2.",
        "Background 2.1 Entity Tracking The task of identifying named entities must be distinguished from entity tracking, which involves identifying mentions, relations, and the co-references that may exist between them.",
        "In this regard, a NE may contain only one mention such as a person name (e.g., Mohammed Morsi), but when a pronoun is used to refer to the same person, it is considered another mention of that entity.",
        "Moreover, a nominal (e.g., president) can also be used as a mention to refer to the same NE (cf. Zitouni et al. 2005).",
        "It should be noted that the richness of Arabic morphology allows two mentions to appear in one 470 Shaalan A Survey of Arabic Named Entity Recognition and Classification word (e.g., A J?",
        "KP our president, president-our), where a pronominal ( A K, our) can appear as a suffix pronoun to a nominal (e.g., president ?",
        "KP).",
        "A co-reference exists when a group of mentions refers to the same entity.",
        "For example, in the sentence The [Egyptian President], [Mohammad Morsi], as the [chair of the 15th Non-Aligned Movement summit] declared opening of the 16th summit, there are three mentions that refer to the same person.",
        "Mentions also include aliases such as Abu Ammar, which refers to the same entity as Yasser Arafat.",
        "An entity relation may be established between two or more NEs, such as a person, an organization, a location, or a specific time.",
        "Relationships between NEs can be binary, such as person-affiliation or organization-location, or may involve more entities; for example, [a person] is in [a place] at [a specific time].",
        "The entity relation is usually expressed in a predicate form and is used to establish relations such as whether two persons were working at the same organization at the same time (Ben Hamadou, Odile, and He?la 2010a).",
        "In summary, it is important to direct attention to the choice of the recognition unit (i.e., real world NE, mention, co-reference, or relation), because mention detec-tion, co-reference resolution, and relation extraction are considered more difficult than the traditional NER task due to the complexity incurred by extracting non-named mentions, grouping mentions into entities, and deriving semantic relations among entities.",
        "2.2 The Broader Role of NER The implications of research in NER for NLP more generally are too obvious to enumerate.",
        "Examples of applications for which NER is useful are shown in this section.",
        "Information Retrieval.",
        "This is the task of identifying and retrieving relevant documents from a set of data according to an input query.",
        "A study by Guo et al. (2009) has indicated that about 71% of the queries in search engines contain NEs.",
        "Information Retrieval can benefit from NER in two phases (Benajiba, Diab, and Rosso 2009a): firstly, recognizing the NEs within the query; and secondly, recognizing the NEs within the searched documents, and then extracting the relevant documents taking into account their classified NEs and how they are related to the query.",
        "For example, the word \u0010?QK Qm.?",
        "'@ (Aljazeera) can be recognized as an organization name or a noun corresponding to the word island; the correct classification will facilitate extracting relevant documents.",
        "Question Answering.",
        "This is very similar to Information Retrieval but with more sophisticated results.",
        "A Question Answering system takes questions as input and gives in return concise and precise answers (Ezzeldin and Shaheen 2012).",
        "The NER task can be utilized in the phase of analyzing the question so as to recognize the NEs within the question that will help later in identifying the relevant documents and constructing the answer from relevant passages (Molla?, van Zaanen, and Smith 2006; Badawy, Shaheen, and Hamadene 2011; Lahsen, Bouzoubaa, and Rosso 2012).",
        "For instance, the NE ???",
        "B@ \u0010?Q?\u0011??",
        "@ (Middle East) may be classified as an organization name (e.g., a newspaper) or as a location name according to the context.",
        "Hence, the correct classification for the NE will help to target the relevant group of documents that answer the input query.",
        "Moreover, Question Answering systems could benefit substantially from NER, because the answer to many factoid questions involve NEs (Trigui et al. 2012) (e.g., answers to who (??",
        "??/?",
        "?A?)",
        "questions usually involve persons or organizations, where ( ?K @) 471  questions involve locations, and when (?",
        "\u0010??)",
        "questions involve temporal expressions) (Brini et al. 2009).",
        "Machine Translation.",
        "This is the task of automatically translating a text from one natural language into another.",
        "NEs need special attention in order to decide which parts of an NE should be meaning-translated and which parts should be phoneme-transliterated (Al-Onaizan and Knight 2002b; Hassan and Sorensen 2005).",
        "Usually this depends on the type of the NE (Chen, Yang, and Lin 2003).",
        "For example, personal names tend to be transliterated.1 For a location name, the name part and the category part (e.g., mountains) are usually transliterated and translated, respectively.",
        "Organization names are completely different in that most of the constituents are translated (e.g., United Nations).",
        "The quality of the NER system plays a significant role in determining the overall quality of the machine translation system, and hence, NE translation is critical for most multilingual application systems (Babych and Hartley 2003; Ben Hamadou, Odile, and He?la 2010b; Steinberger 2012).",
        "In addition, NE translation is very important for other applications such as cross-lingual information retrieval for extracting newly introduced NEs from the Web and news documents and regularly updating the list of NE translation pairs (Hassan, Fahmy, and Hassan 2007).",
        "Text Clustering.",
        "Search results clustering may exploit NER by ranking the resulting clusters based on the ratio of entities each cluster contains (Benajiba, Diab, and Rosso 2009a).",
        "This enhances the process of analyzing the nature of each cluster and also improves the clustering approach in terms of selected features.",
        "For example, time expressions along with location NEs can be utilized as factors that will give an indication of when and where the events mentioned in a cluster of documents have occurred.",
        "Navigation Systems.",
        "These systems, which facilitate navigation using digital maps, now play significant roles in our lives.",
        "They provide directions, information about nearby places possibly linked with other on-line resources, and traffic conditions.",
        "In these systems, points of interest (also known as waypoints) are NEs that are stored in a database with their geographic coordinates (Kim, Kim, and Cho 2012).",
        "They refer to areas of interest that are typically of significance to, among others, tourists, visitors, and rescuers, allowing the location of places such as parking areas, shops, hospitals, restaurants, universities, schools, landmarks, and so on.",
        "3.",
        "Linguistic Issues and Challenges Arabic is a highly inflected language, with a rich morphology and complex syntax (Al-Sughaiyer and Al-Kharashi 2004; Ryding 2005).",
        "Current Arabic NLP research efforts cannot cope with the massive growth of Arabic data on the Internet and the heightened need for accurate and robust processing tools (Abdul-Mageed, Diab, and Korayem 2011).",
        "NER is considered one of the building blocks of Arabic NLP tools and applications.",
        "Though significant progress has been achieved in Arabic NER research in the last decade, the task remains challenging due to the following 1 Transliteration is the task of replacing words in the source language with their approximate phonetic or spelling equivalents in the target language.",
        "It unambiguously represents the graphemes, rather than the phonemes, of the NE.",
        "Transliteration between languages that use similar alphabets and sound systems is very simple.",
        "However, transliterating NEs between Arabic and English is a non-trivial task, mainly due to the differences in their sound and writing systems (Al-Onaizan and Knight 2002a).",
        "472 Shaalan A Survey of Arabic Named Entity Recognition and Classification features of the Arabic language; opportunities for improved performance are still available.",
        "3.1 Arabic Script The Arabic language relies on the Arabic script, which is also used in writing other languages such as Persian, Urdu, Kurdish, and Pashto (Habash 2010).",
        "Some researchers have developed Arabic computational tools and resources based on Romanized2 or transliterated3 Arabic text rather than genuine Arabic script (e.g., Buckwalter's Arabic Morphological Analyzer [Buckwalter 2002], the CJK lexical resources [Halpern 2009], and Arabic NER systems [Bidhend, Minaei-Bidgoli, and Jouzi 2012; Zayed and El-Beltagy 2012]), either because these formats are more familiar to non-native Arabic speakers or because of limitations in the Arabic script encoding imposed by the development environment.",
        "This approach should disappear over time with the rapidly growing quantity of Arabic script-based Web content and new technologies that support multiple encodings.",
        "3.2 Language in Use With regard to language usage, Arabic can be classified into three types (Elgibali 2005): Classical Arabic (CA), Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), and Colloquial Arabic Dialects (Abdel Monem et al. 2008; Habash 2010; Korayem, Crandall, and Abdul-Mageed 2012).",
        "As far as Arabic NE is concerned, it is important to know the difference between these various uses of the language.",
        "CA is the formal version that has been used continuously for over 1,500 years as the language of Islam, used by Muslims in their daily prayers.",
        "Most Arabic religious texts are written in CA.",
        "In this context, person name recognition is of particular interest in order to identify and verify the correctness of citations (Zaraket and Makhlouta 2012) (a sequence of hadith narrators referencing each other who provide narrations related to the Prophet Mohammed based on known truthful and untruthful relaters).",
        "The importance of verification is that the authenticity of a hadith needs to be established before his narration is used in jurisprudence, and this depends on the credibility of the narrators.",
        "Furthermore, many historical Arabic manuscripts are handwritten in CA (or Arabic calligraphy); when they are digitized and converted to text, Arabic NE will become important.",
        "MSA is the language of today's Arabic newspapers, magazines, periodicals, letters, modern writers, and education.",
        "MSA is one of the six official languages of the United Nations used in meetings and official UN documents.",
        "Most Arabic NLP, including NER research projects, is focused on MSA.",
        "The main difference between MSA and CA lies in the vocabulary, including NEs, and the orthography of conventional written Arabic (Farber et al. 2008): MSA does not require the inclusion of short vowels.",
        "Moreover, MSA reflects the needs of contemporary expression, whereas CA reflects the needs of older styles.",
        "For example, the Arabic NEs in rare documents and old manuscripts that refer 2 Transliteration from Arabic to languages using the Latin alphabet is called Romanization.",
        "3 In a multilingual context, transliteration of NEs would differ depending on the target language (Pouliquenet et al. 2005).",
        "For example, the Arabic name ?",
        "????",
        "could be transliterated into English as Mustafa or Moustapha, while a likely French transliteration would be Moustafa or Moustapha.",
        "473  to places, jobs, or organizations are different from the corresponding NEs in modern documents.",
        "Colloquial Arabic is the spoken Arabic used by Arabs in their informal daily com-munication; it is not taught in schools due to its irregularity.",
        "Unlike the widespread use of MSA across all Arab countries, colloquial Arabic is a regional variant that differs not only among Arab countries, but also across regions in the same country.",
        "Written Colloquial Arabic is presently used mainly in social media communication.",
        "For comparison, a person name in either CA or MSA could be expressed in Arabic dialect by more than one form; for example, PXA\u0010??",
        "@ YJ.?",
        "(Abd Al-Kader) versus PXAm.?",
        "'@ YJ.?",
        "(Abd Al-Gader) or PX \u000e B@ YJ.?",
        "(Abd Al-Aader).",
        "Salloum and Habash (2012) presented a universal machine translation pre-processing approach that has the ability to produce MSA paraphrases of dialectal input.",
        "In this way, available MSA tools can also be used to process Colloquial Arabic text, as most of the Arabic NER systems are developed to support MSA.",
        "3.3 Lack of Capitalization Unlike languages like English that use the Latin script, where most NEs begin with a capital letter, capitalization is not a distinguishing orthographic feature of Arabic script for recognizing NEs such as proper names, acronyms, and abbreviations (Farber et al. 2008).",
        "The ambiguity caused by the absence of this feature is further increased by the fact that most Arabic proper nouns (NEs) are indistinguishable from forms that are common nouns and adjectives (non-NEs).",
        "Thus, an approach relying only on looking up entries in proper noun dictionaries would not be an appropriate way to tackle this problem, as ambiguous tokens/words that fall in this category are more likely to be used as non-proper nouns in text (Algahtani 2011).",
        "For example, the Arabic proper name ?Q?\u0011?",
        "@ (Ashraf ) can be used in a sentence as a given name, an inflected verb (he-supervised), and a superlative (the-most-honorable) (Mesfar 2007).",
        "An NE is usually found in a context, namely, with trigger and cue words to the left and/or right of the NE.",
        "Therefore, it is common to resolve this type of ambiguity by analyzing the context surrounding the NE.",
        "However, this might require deeper analysis of the NE's context.",
        "As an example, consider the nominal sentence \u0010?Ym.\u001a'.",
        "??",
        "@P ?\u0010??",
        "?, whose literal meaning might be the falling of his head in grandfather/Jeddah.",
        "The correct analysis of the trigger constituent ??",
        "@P ?\u0010???",
        "as a multiword expression denoting place of birth leads to the recognition of the following noun as a location name.",
        "3.4 Agglutination The agglutinative nature of Arabic results in many different patterns that create many lexical variations.",
        "Each word may consist of one or more prefixes, a stem or root, and one or more suffixes in different combinations, resulting in a very systematic but complicated morphology.",
        "Clitics, which in other languages such as English would be treated as separate words, agglutinate to words.",
        "Arabic has a set of clitics that are attached to an NE, including conjunctions such as ?",
        "(Waw, and) and ?",
        "(if ... then) and prepositions such as ?",
        "(Laam, for/to), ?",
        "(k, as), and H. (baa, by/with), or a combination of both, as in ??",
        "(Waw-Laam, and-for).",
        "NER relies on the words forming the NE and the context in which it appears.",
        "Both the words and the contexts may appear in different inflected forms.",
        "In order to address data sparseness issues without requiring 474 Shaalan A Survey of Arabic Named Entity Recognition and Classification massive training corpora, these bound morphemes should undergo morphological preprocessing.",
        "One solution is to omit all the affixes and keep only the root morpheme (Grefenstette, Semmar, and Elkateb-Gara 2005; Farber et al. 2008; Alkharashi 2009).",
        "For example, the analysis of the word Q????.?",
        "(and by Egypt, and-by-Egypt) yields Q???",
        "(Egypt) as a location name.",
        "Another solution is to perform text segmentation and insert a delimiter between constituent morphemes, thus preventing loss of contextual information (Benajiba and Rosso 2007).",
        "This information is more convenient for NLP tasks that need to process these morphemes.",
        "As an example that shows an occurrence of both prefix and suffix morphemes, consider the trigger word A?",
        "\u0010D???A??",
        "(and its capital, and-capital-its), which is segmented into three parts?a conjunction, and both a nominal and a pronominal mention?separated by a space character: A?",
        "\u0010????A?",
        "?",
        "(and capital its).",
        "3.5 Optional Short Vowels Arabic text contains diacritics representing most vowels that affect the phonetic representation and give different meaning to the same lexical form.4 Nowadays, the modern version of Arabic is written without diacritics, creating a one-to-many, unvocalized-to-vocalized, ambiguity (Alkharashi 2009), which gives mutually incompatible morphological analyses for the same surface form.",
        "As such, most Arabic texts that appear in the media (whether in printed documents or digitized format) are undiacritized.",
        "This is comprehensible for native Arabic speakers, but not for a computational system.",
        "The simplification made by ignoring such diacritics had led to structural and lexical types of ambiguity because different diacritics represent different meanings.",
        "These ambiguities can only be resolved by contextual information and an adequate knowledge of the language (Benajiba, Diab, and Rosso 2009a).",
        "For instance, Q?\u0010?",
        "may refer to the country name Qatar (a location NE) if transliterated as qatar, the literal meaning of country (a trigger word for location NEs), or radius (a trigger word for measure NEs) if transliterated as qutr, or the literal meaning of distill if transliterated as qat?ar.",
        "Unfortunately, this solution might not work if the contextual information is itself ambiguous due to non-vocalization (Mesfar 2007).",
        "To consider another example, the likely vocalizations of the unvoweled form \u0010???",
        "??",
        "might lead to trigger words that denote two different NE types (e.g., \u0010?",
        "?",
        "\u000f?",
        "?",
        "?",
        "[a foundation/corporation], internal evidence of a constituent of an organization name; and \u0010?",
        "??",
        "?",
        "?",
        "[a founder], a trigger word for personal names).",
        "3.6 Inherent Ambiguity in Named Entities Arabic, like other languages, faces the problem of ambiguity between two or more NEs.",
        "For example consider the following text: ?K Q K A ??",
        "AK.",
        "I. kP XAK.",
        "@ Y?g@ (Ahmed Abad welcomed the winners).",
        "In this example, XAK.",
        "@ Y?g@ (Ahmed Abad) is both a person name and a location name, thereby giving rise to a conflict situation, where the same NE is tagged as two different NE types.",
        "Heuristic techniques for resolving ambiguities by cross-recognizing NE types are suggested.",
        "One heuristic technique, proposed by Shaalan and Raza (2009), uses heuristic rules for preferring one NE type over the other.",
        "4 A diacritic in Arabic is a small mark placed either above or under a letter to indicate what short vowel will follow that letter.",
        "Long vowels are usually indicated by one of three designated letters.",
        "475  Another technique, proposed by Benajiba, Diab, and Rosso (2008b), favors the NE type for which the classifier achieves the highest precision.",
        "3.7 Lack of Uniformity in Writing Styles Arabic has a high level of transcriptional ambiguity: An NE can be transliterated in a multitude of ways (Shaalan and Raza 2007).",
        "This multiplicity arises from both differences among Arabic writers and ambiguous transcription schemes (Halpern 2009).",
        "The lack of standardization is significant and leads to many variants of the same word that are spelled differently but still correspond to the same word with the same meaning, creating a many-to-one, variants-to-well-formed, ambiguity.",
        "For example, transcribing (also known as ?Arabizing?)",
        "an NE such as the city of Washington into Arabic NE produces variants such as ??j.",
        "J \u0011?",
        "@?, ??",
        "J \u0011?",
        "@?, ??",
        "?",
        "J \u0011?",
        "@?, ??",
        "J \u0011??.",
        "One reason for this is that Arabic has more speech sounds than Western European languages, which can ambiguously or erroneously lead to an NE having more variants.",

        "The number of current state-of-the-art of Arabic linguistic resources is still insufficient comparedwith Arabic's actual importance as a language.Many existing Arabic NER resources are annotated manually or are only available at significant expense.",
        "We have described some research that adopted semi-automatic (bootstrapping) methods in order to enrich Arabic NER resources from diverse text types such as Web sources and (multilingual) corpora developed within evaluation projects.",
        "In the Arabic NER field, NEs falling under proper names representing person, location, and organization names are commonly applied to newswire domains, reflecting the importance of these limited NEs in this domain.",
        "We have described three main approaches that have been used to develop Arabic NER systems: linguistic rule-based, ML-based, and hybrid approaches.",
        "Rule-based systems follow a classical approach and ML-based systems follow a modern and rapidly growing approach.",
        "The main reasons for choosing the rule-based approach are the lack and limitations of Arabic linguistic resources, optimized platform architectures for rule-based systems, and the high performance of such systems.",
        "In addition, ML-based approaches have proven their usefulness as they take advantage of ML algorithms by building models that include learning patterns associated with individual entity types trained from annotated data.",
        "The success of both the rule-based and ML-based approaches motivates the investigation of a hybrid Arabic NER approach, yielding significant improvements by exploiting the rule-based decisions on NEs as features used by the ML classifier.",
        "Features are a critical aspect and are the key component for enhancing the performance of NER systems.",
        "We reviewed many attempts to select features that investigate the sensitivity of each entity when applied to different sets of features.",
        "We showed how researchers applied different techniques that benefit differently from the enabled features and obtain different results for varying NE types.",
        "Some suggest that NER for Arabic use not only language-independent features but also Arabic-specific features.",
        "Researchers sometimes exploit language-independent features based on promising variables, such as lexical and orthographic features, to overcome the problems related 502 Shaalan A Survey of Arabic Named Entity Recognition and Classification to the Arabic language and orthography.",
        "Lexical features avoid complex morphology by extracting the word prefix and suffix sequence of a word from the character n-gram of leading and trailing letters.",
        "Orthographic features attempt to overcome the lack of capitalization for NEs in Arabic by relying on the corresponding English capitalization of NEs.",
        "Alternatively, other researchers suggest including a rich set of language specific features extracted by Arabic morpho-syntactic tools in order to deeply analyze the inherent complex structure of NEs within their context.",
        "Regardless of the features selected, various studies have reported that significant system performance is achieved when a combination that includes all features is enabled.",
        "We have discussed many existing tools that have been used to build many different Arabic NER systems.",
        "IDEs are convenient for rapid development of NER systems.",
        "GATE is more diversified and comprehensive for developing rule-based Arabic NER systems because it has built-in gazetteers and rules offering the ability to create new ones.",
        "On the other hand, the availability of diverse generic ML tools is sufficient for developing a wide range of Arabic NER classifiers.",
        "The main problem with these generic tools is that they are language-independent with limited support for Arabic.",
        "Fortunately, the availability of Arabic morpho-syntactic pre-processing tools, such as BAMA and its successor MADA for morphological processing and AMIRA for BPC, has lessened the need for extensive development efforts.",
        "Almost all of the tools adopted for developing Arabic NER provide for system evaluation by calculating the value of Precision, Recall, and F-measure.",
        "Sometimes it is too expensive to acquire linguistic evaluation resources to compare a proposed system's performance to existing systems.",
        "Fortunately, the increasing contributions from the Arabic NLP research community have been sufficient to provide a practical solution and satisfy the critical need for free corpora and gazetteers (e.g., ANERsys, which can be used to compare Arabic NER under different experimental settings).",
        "We have reviewed the state-of-the-art in Arabic NER systems in some detail.",
        "It should be noted that the list of references provided here may not be comprehensive.",
        "Our aim was to provide a review of the essential aspects of Arabic NER and discuss major publications that havemade use of those ideas.",
        "We hope that this survey provides a way to access the main branches of the literature dealing with Arabic NER research and guides researchers in interesting and fruitful research directions.",
        "Since the presence of NE in the context of one language points to a correspondence in other natural languages, studies of NEs in one language could provide mutual and valuable insight for developing resources and technologies that can handle NEs in many languages.",
        "This survey describes the progress made by Arabic NER research.",
        "This study might be easily extrapolated to most NLP tasks in general and to many of the morphologically complex/rich languages in particular.",
