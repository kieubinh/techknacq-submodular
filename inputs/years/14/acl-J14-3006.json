        "University of Geneva Mirella Lapata??",
        "University of Edinburgh As in many natural language processing tasks, data-driven models based on supervised learning have become the method of choice for semantic role labeling.",
        "These models are guaranteed to perform well when given sufficient amount of labeled training data.",
        "Producing this data is costly and time-consuming, however, thus raising the question of whether unsupervised methods offer a viable alternative.",
        "The working hypothesis of this article is that semantic roles can be induced without human supervision from a corpus of syntactically parsed sentences based on three linguistic principles: (1) arguments in the same syntactic position (within a specific linking) bear the same semantic role, (2) arguments within a clause bear a unique role, and (3) clusters representing the same semantic role should be more or less lexically and distributionally equivalent.",
        "We present a method that implements these principles and formalizes the task as a graph partitioning problem, whereby argument instances of a verb are represented as vertices in a graph whose edges express similarities between these instances.",
        "The graph consists of multiple edge layers, each one capturing a different aspect of argument-instance similarity, and we develop extensions of standard clustering algorithms for partitioning such multi-layer graphs.",
        "Experiments for English and German demonstrate that our approach is able to induce semantic role clusters that are consistently better than a strong baseline and are competitive with the state of the art.",
        "1.",
        "Introduction Recent years have seen increased interest in the shallow semantic analysis of natural language text.",
        "The term is often used to describe the automatic identification and labeling of the semantic roles conveyed by sentential constituents (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002).",
        "Semantic roles describe the relations that hold between a predicate and its arguments (e.g., ?who?",
        "did ?what?",
        "to ?whom?, ?when?, ?where?, and ?how?)",

        "2014 Association for Computational Linguistics  is shallow but relatively straightforward to infer automatically and useful for the development of broad-coverage, domain-independent language understanding systems.",
        "Indeed, the analysis produced by existing semantic role labelers has been shown to benefit a wide spectrum of applications ranging from information extraction (Surdeanu et al. 2003) and question answering (Shen and Lapata 2007), to machine translation (Wu and Fung 2009) and summarization (Melli et al. 2005).",
        "In the example sentences below, window occupies different syntactic positions?it is the object of broke in sentences (1a,b), and the subject in (1c).",
        "In all instances, it bears the same semantic role, that is, the patient or physical object affected by the breaking event.",
        "Analogously, ball is the instrument of break both when realized as a prepositional phrase in (1a) and as a subject in (1b).",
        "(1) a.",
        "[Jim]A0 broke the [window]A1 with a [ball]A2.",
        "b. The [ball]A2 broke the [window]A1.",
        "c. The [window]A1 broke [last night]TMP.",
        "Also notice that all three instances of break in Example (1) have apparently similar surface syntax with a subject and a noun directly following the predicate.",
        "However, in sentence (1a) the subject of break expresses the agent role, in (1b) it expresses the instrument role, and in (1c) the patient role.",
        "The examples illustrate the fact that predicates can license several alternate mappings or linkings between their semantic roles and their syntactic realization.",
        "Pairs of linkings allowed by a single predicate are often called diathesis alternations (Levin 1993).",
        "Sentence pair (1a,b) is an example of the instrument subject alternation, and pair (1b,c) illustrates the causative alternation.",
        "Resolving the mapping between the syntactic dependents of a predicate (e.g., subject, object) and the semantic roles that they each express is one of the major challenges faced by semantic role labelers.",
        "The semantic roles in the examples are labeled in the style of PropBank (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005), a broad-coverage human-annotated corpus of semantic roles and their syntactic realizations.",
        "Under the PropBank annotation framework each predicate is associated with a set of core roles (named A0, A1, A2, and so on) whose interpretations are specific to that predicate1 and a set of adjunct roles such as location or time whose interpretation is common across predicates (e.g., last night in sentence (1c)).",
        "The availability of PropBank and related resources (e.g., FrameNet; Ruppenhofer et al. 2006) has sparked the development of a variety semantic role labeling systems, most of which conceptualize the task as a supervised learning problem and rely on role-annotated data for model training.",
        "Most of these systems implement a two-stage architecture consisting of argument identification (determining the arguments of the verbal predicate) and argument classification (labeling these arguments with semantic roles).",
        "Current approaches deliver reasonably good performance?a system will recall around 81% of the arguments correctly and 95% of those will be assigned a correct semantic role (see Ma`rquez et al. [2008] for details), although only on languages and domains for which large amounts of role-annotated training data are available.",
        "Unfortunately, the reliance on labeled data, which is both difficult and expensive to produce, presents a major obstacle to the widespread application of semantic role labeling across different languages and text genres.",
        "Although corpora with semantic 1 More precisely, A0 and A1 have a common interpretation across predicates as proto-agent and proto-patient in the sense of Dowty (1991).",
        "634 Lang and Lapata Similarity-Driven Semantic Role Induction via Graph Partitioning role annotations exist nowadays in other languages (e.g., German, Spanish, Catalan, Chinese, Korean), they tend to be smaller than their English equivalents and of limited value for modeling purposes.",
        "Even within English, a language for which two major annotated corpora are available, systems trained on PropBank demonstrate a marked decrease in performance (approximately by 10%) when tested on out-of-domain data (Pradhan, Ward, and Martin 2008).",
        "The data requirements for supervised systems and the current paucity of such data has given impetus to the development of unsupervised methods that learn from unlabeled data.",
        "If successful, unsupervised approaches could lead to significant resource savings and the development of semantic role labelers that require less engineering effort.",
        "Besides being interesting on their own right, from a theoretical and linguistic perspective, unsupervised methods can provide valuable features for downstream (supervised) processing and serve as a preprocessing step for applications that require broad coverage understanding.",
        "In this article we study the potential of unsupervised methods for semantic role labeling.",
        "As in the supervised case, we decompose the problem into an argument identification step and an argument classification step.",
        "Our work primarily focuses on argument classification, which we term role induction, because there is no predefined set of semantic roles in the unsupervised case, and these must be induced from data.",
        "The goal is to assign argument instances to clusters such that each cluster contains arguments corresponding to a specific semantic role and each role corresponds to exactly one cluster.",
        "Unsupervised learning is known to be challenging for many natural language processing problems and role induction is no exception.",
        "Firstly, it is difficult to define a learning objective function whose optimization will yield an accurate model.",
        "This contrasts with the supervised setting, where the objective function can directly reflect training error (i.e., some estimate of the mismatch between model output and the gold standard) and the model can be tuned to replicate human output for a given input under mathematical guarantees regarding the accuracy of the trained model.",
        "Secondly, it is also more difficult to incorporate rich feature sets into an unsupervised model (Berg- Kirkpatrick et al. 2010).",
        "Unless we explicitly know exactly how features interact, more features may not necessarily lead to a more accurate model and may even decrease performance.",
        "In the supervised setting, feature interactions relevant for a particular learning task can be determined to a large extent automatically and thus a large number of them can be included even if their significance is not clear a priori.",
        "The lack of an extensional definition (in the form of training examples) of the target concept makes a strong case for the development of unsupervised methods that use problem specific prior knowledge.",
        "The idea is to derive a strong inductive bias (Gordon and Desjardins 1995) based on this prior knowledge that will guide the learning towards the correct target concept.",
        "For semantic role induction, we propose to build on the following linguistic principles: 1.",
        "Semantic roles are unique within a particular frame.",
        "2.",
        "Arguments occurring in a specific syntactic position within a specific linking all bear the same semantic role.",
        "3.",
        "The (asymptotic) distribution over argument heads is the same for two clusters that represent the same semantic role.",
        "We hypothesize that these three principles are, at least in theory, sufficient for inducing high-quality semantic role clusters.",
        "A challenge, of course, lies in adequately operationalizing them so that they guide the unsupervised learner towards meaningful 635  solutions.",
        "The approach taken in this article translates these principles into estimates of similarity (or dissimilarity) between argument instances and/or clusters of argument instances.",
        "Principle (1) states that argument instances occurring in the same frame (i.e., clause) cannot bear the same semantic role, and are thus dissimilar.",
        "From Principle (2) it follows that arguments occurring in the same syntactic position within the same linking can be considered similar (leaving aside for the moment the difficulty of representing linkings through syntactic cues observable in a corpus).",
        "Principle (3) states that two clusters of instances containing similar distributions over head words should be considered similar.",
        "Based on these similarity estimates we construct a graph whose vertices represent argument instances and whose edges express similarities between these instances.",
        "The graphs consist of multiple edge layers, each capturing one particular type of argument-instance similarity.",
        "For example, one layer will be used to represent whether argument instances occur in the same frame, and another layer will represent whether two arguments have a similar head word, and so on.",
        "Given this graph representation of the data, we formalize role induction as the problem of partitioning the graph into clusters of similar vertices.",
        "We present two algorithms for partitioning multi-layer graphs, which are adaptations of standard graph partitioning algorithms to the multi-layer setting.",
        "The algorithms differ in the way they exploit the similarity information encoded in the graph.",
        "The first one is based on agglomeration, where two clusters containing similar instances are grouped into a larger cluster.",
        "The second one is based on propagation, where role-label information is transferred from one cluster to another based on their similarity.",
        "To understand how the aforementioned principles might allow us to handle the ambiguity stemming from alternate linkings, consider again Example (1).",
        "The most important thing to note is that, whereas the subject position is ambiguous with respect to the semantic roles it can express (it can be A0, A1, or A2), we can resolve the ambiguity by exploiting overt syntactic cues of the underlying linking.",
        "For example, the predicate break is transitive in sentences (1a) and (1b), and intransitive in sentence (1c).",
        "Thus, by taking into account the argument's syntactic position and the predicate's transitivity, we can guess that the semantic role expressed by the subject in sentence (1c) is different from the roles expressed by the subjects in sentences (1a,b).",
        "Now consider the more difficult case of distinguishing between the subjects in sentences (1a) and (1b).",
        "One linking cue that could help here is the prepositional phrase in sentence (1a), which results in a syntactic frame different from sentence (1b).",
        "Were the prepositional phrase omitted, we would attempt to disambiguate the linkings by resorting to lexical-semantic cues (e.g., by taking into account whether the subject is animate).",
        "In sum, if we encode sufficiently many linking cues, then the resulting fine-grained syntactic information will discriminate ambiguous semantic roles.",
        "In cases where syntactic cues are not discerning enough, we can exploit lexical information and group arguments together based on their lexical content.",
        "The remainder of this article is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 provides an overview of unsupervised methods for semantic role labeling.",
        "Sections 3 and 4 present the details of our method, that is, how the graphs are constructed and partitioned.",
        "Role induction experiments in English and German are described in sections 5 and 6, respectively.",
        "Discussion of future work concludes in section 7.",
        "2.",
        "Related Work The bulk of previous work on semantic role labeling has focused on supervised methods (Ma`rquez et al. 2008), although a few semi-supervised and unsupervised approaches 636 Lang and Lapata Similarity-Driven Semantic Role Induction via Graph Partitioning have been proposed.",
        "The majority of semi-supervised models have been developed within a framework known as annotation projection.",
        "The idea is to combine labeled and unlabeled data by projecting annotations from a labeled source sentence onto an unlabeled target sentence within the same language (Fu?rstenau and Lapata 2009) or across different languages (Pado?",
        "and Lapata 2009).",
        "Beyond annotation projection, Gordon and Swanson (2007) propose to increase the coverage of PropBank to unseen verbs by finding syntactically similar (labeled) verbs and using their annotations as surrogate training data.",
        "Swier and Stevenson (2004) were the first to introduce an unsupervised semantic role labeling system.",
        "Their algorithm induces role labels following a bootstrapping scheme where the set of labeled instances is iteratively expanded using a classifier trained on previously labeled instances.",
        "Their method starts with a data set containing no role annotations at all, but crucially relies on VerbNet (Kipper, Dang, and Palmer 2000) for identifying the arguments of predicates and making initial role assignments.",
        "VerbNet is a manually constructed lexicon of verb classes, each of which is explicitly associated with argument realization and semantic role specifications.",
        "In this article we will not assume the availability of any role-semantic resources, although we do assume that sentences are syntactically analyzed.",
        "There have been two main approaches to role induction from parsed data.",
        "Under the first approach, semantic roles are modeled as latent variables in a (directed) graphical model that relates a verb, its semantic roles, and their possible syntactic realizations (Grenager and Manning 2006).",
        "Role induction here corresponds to inferring the state of the latent variables representing the semantic roles of arguments.",
        "Following up on this work, Lang and Lapata (2010) reformulate role induction as the process of detecting alternations and finding a canonical syntactic form for them.",
        "Verbal arguments are then assigned roles, according to their position in this canonical form, because each position references a specific role.",
        "Their model extends the logistic classifier with hidden variables and is trained in a manner that takes advantage of the close relationship between syntactic functions and semantic roles.",
        "More recently, Garg and Henderson (2012) extend the latent-variable approach by modeling the sequential order of roles.",
        "The second approach is similarity-driven and based on clustering.",
        "Lang and Lapata (2011a) propose an algorithm that first splits the set of all argument instances of a verb according to their syntactic position within a particular linking and then iteratively merges clusters.",
        "A different clusstering algorithm is adopted in Lang and Lapata (2011b).",
        "Specifically, they induce semantic roles via graph partitioning: Each vertex in the graph corresponds to an argument instance and edges represent a heuristically defined measure of their lexical and syntactic similarity.",
        "The similarity-driven approach has been recently adopted by Titov and Klementiev (2012a), who propose a Bayesian clustering algorithm based on the Chinese Restaurant Process.",
        "In addition, they present a method that shares linking preferences across verbs using a distance-dependent Chinese Restaurant Process prior which encourages similar verbs to have similar linking preferences.",
        "Titov and Klementiev (2012b) further introduce the use of multilingual data for improving role induction.",
        "There has also been work on unsupervised methods for argument identification.",
        "Abend, Reichart, and Rappoport (2009) devise a method for recognizing the arguments of predicates that relies solely on part of speech annotations, whereas Abend and Rappoport (2010a) distinguish between core and adjunct roles, using an unsupervised parser and part-of-speech tagger.",
        "More generally, shallow semantic representations 637  induced from syntactic information are commonly used in lexicon acquisition and information extraction tasks.",
        "For example, Lin and Pantel (2001) cluster syntactic relations between pairs of words as expressed by parse tree paths into semantic relations by exploiting lexical distributional similarity.",
        "Although not compatible with PropBank or semantic roles as such, Poon and Domingos (2009) and Titov and Klementiev (2011) also induce semantic information from dependency parses and apply it to a question answering task for the biomedical domain.",
        "Another example is the work by Gamallo, Agustini, and Lopes (2005), who cluster similar syntactic positions in order to develop models of selectional preferences to be used for word sense induction and the resolution of attachment ambiguities.",
        "The work described here unifies the two clustering methods presented in Lang and Lapata (2011a and 2011b) by reformulating them as graph partitioning algorithms.",
        "It also extends them by utilizing multi-layer graphs which separate the similarities between instances on different features (e.g., part-of-speech, argument head) into different layers.",
        "This has the advantage that similarity scores on individual features do not have to be eagerly combined into a similarity score between instances.",
        "Instead, one can first aggregate the similarity scores on each feature layer between two clusters and then combine them into a similarity score between clusters.",
        "This is more robust, as the feature-wise similarity scores between clusters can be computed in a principled way and the heuristic combination step is deferred to the end (see Section 4 for details).",
        "Besides providing a general modeling framework for semantic role induction, we discuss in detail the linguistic principles guiding our modeling choices and assess their applicability across languages.",
        "Specifically, we show that the framework presented here (and the aforementioned principles) can be readily applied to English and German with identical parametrizations for both languages and without fundamentally changing the underlying model features, despite major syntactic differences between the two languages.",
        "3.",
        "Graph Construction We begin by explaining how we construct a graph that represents verbs and their arguments.",
        "Next, we describe how edge weights are computed?these translate to similarity scores between argument instances -- and then move on to provide the details of our graph-partitioning algorithms.",
        "As mentioned earlier, we formalize semantic role induction as a clustering problem.",
        "Clustering algorithms (see Jain, Murty, and Flynn [1999] for an overview) commonly take a matrix of pairwise similarity scores between instances as input and produce a set of output clusters, often satisfying some explicitly defined optimality criterion.",
        "The success or failure of the clustering approach is closely tied to the adequacy of the employed similarity function for the task at hand.",
        "The graph partitioning view of clustering (see Schaeffer [2007] for a detailed treatment) arises when instances are represented as the vertices of a graph and the similarity matrix is interpreted as the weight matrix of the graph.",
        "For semantic role induction, a straightforward application of clustering would be to construct a graph for each verbal predicate such that vertices correspond to argument instances of the verb and edge weights quantify the similarity between these instances.",
        "Lang and Lapata (2011b) hand-craft an instance similarity function by taking into account different features such as the argument head or its syntactic position.",
        "Defining an appropriate instance-wise similarity function is nevertheless problematic as 638 Lang and Lapata Similarity-Driven Semantic Role Induction via Graph Partitioning Figure 1 A multi-layer graph consists of multiple edge layers, one for each similarity feature.",
        "Multi-layer graph partitioning algorithms exploit this representation by computing separate similarity scores between clusters for each feature layer and then combining them into a single overall similarity score.",
        "This is advantageous over single-layer graph partitioning because it avoids eagerly combining the similarity scores for individual features into a heuristic instance-wise similarity score.",
        "weights have to be chosen heuristically.",
        "Instead, we will represent similarities with respect to different features on separate edge layers in the graph.",
        "For example, one layer will represent the similarity between the head words of arguments and another one will represent the similarity between pars of speech.",
        "So, given M features, the graph will consist of M layers, one for each feature.",
        "Edge weights on a particular layer quantify the similarity between the instances with respect to that feature.",
        "This is illustrated in Figure 1 for two argument instances and three features.",
        "Formally, a multi-layer graph is defined as a pair (V, {E1, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", EM}) consisting of vertices V and a set of edge layers Ef for f = 1 .",
        ".",
        ".M.",
        "The set of vertices V = {v1, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", vN} consists of all N argument instances for a particular verb.",
        "The edge layer Ef for feature f is constructed by connecting all vertex-pairs with non-zero similarity with respect to f : Ef = {(vi, vj) ?",
        "V ?",
        "V|?f (vi, vj) \u0004= 0}.",
        "(2) where ?f (vi, vj) is a similarity function for feature f , whose form will be discussed in the next section.",
        "Each edge (vi, vj) ?",
        "Ef in layer f is weighted by ?f (vi, vj).",
        "3.1 Feature Similarity Functions Similarities for a specific feature f are measured with a function ?f (vi, vj) which assigns a [?1, 1] value to any pair of instances (vi, vj).",
        "We assume similarities are measured on an interval scale?that is, while sums, differences, and averages of the values of some similarity function ?f express meaningful quantities, products and ratios do not.",
        "More-over, the values of two distinct similarity functions cannot necessarily be meaningfully compared without rescaling.",
        "Positive similarity values indicate that the semantic roles are likely to be the same, negative values indicate that roles are likely to differ, and zero values indicate that there is no evidence for either case.",
        "The magnitude of ?f expresses the degree of confidence in the similarity judgment, with extreme values (i.e., ?1 and 1) indicating maximal confidence.",
        "In our model, we simply use indicator functions which output either 1 or ?1 iff feature values are equal and 0 otherwise.",
        "Specifically, we define four feature similarity functions that we derive from the principles discussed in Section 1.",
        "Our similarity functions are based on the following features: the argument head words and their parts 639  of speech,2 the frame constraint, and the syntactic position within a particular linking.",
        "We measure lexical and part-of-speech similarity as follows: ?lex(vi, vj) = { 1 if vlexi = v lex j 0 otherwise ?pos(vi, vj) = { 1 if vposi = v pos j 0 otherwise.",
        "(3) The constraint that two argument instances vi and vj occurring in the same frame cannot have the same semantic role is captured by the following similarity function: ?frame(vi, vj) = { ?1 if vframei = v frame j 0 otherwise.",
        "(4) Finally, we also measure syntactic similarity through an indicator function ?syn(vi, vj), which assumes value 1 if two instances occur in the same syntactic position within the same linking: ?syn(vi, vj) = { 1 if vsyni = v syn j 0 otherwise.",
        "(5) The syntactic position of an argument is directly given by the parse tree and can be encoded, for example, by the full path from predicate to argument head, or for practical purposes, in order to reduce sparsity, simply through the relation governing the argument head and its linear position relative to the predicate (left or right).",
        "In contrast, linkings are not directly observed, but we can resort to overt syntactic cues as a proxy.",
        "Examples include the verb's voice (active/passive), whether it is transitive, the part-of-speech of the subject, and so on.",
        "We argue that in principle, if sufficiently many cues are taken into account, they will capture one particular linking, although there may be several encodings for the same linking.",
        "Note that syntactic similarity is not used to construct another graph layer; rather, it will be used for deriving initial clusters of instances, as we explain in Section 4.1.",
        "4.",
        "Graph Partitioning The graph partitioning problem consists of finding a set of clusters {c1, .",

        "In the following sections we provide two algorithms for multi-layer graph partitioning, based on standard clustering algorithms for single-layer graphs.",
        "Both algorithms operate on the same graph but differ in terms of the underlying clustering mechanism they use.",
        "The first algorithm is an adaptation of agglomerative clustering (Jain, Murty, and Flynn 1999) to the multi-layer setting: Starting from an initial clustering, the algorithm 2 We include parts of speech as a simple means of alleviating the sparsity of head words.",
        "640 Lang and Lapata Similarity-Driven Semantic Role Induction via Graph Partitioning iteratively merges vertex clusters in order to arrive at increasingly accurate representations of semantic roles.",
        "Rather than greedily merging clusters, our second algorithm is based on propagating cluster membership information among the set of initial clusters (Abney 2007).",
        "4.1 Agglomerative Graph Partitioning The agglomerative algorithm induces clusters in a bottom?up manner starting from an initial cluster assignment that we will subsequently discuss in detail.",
        "Our initialization results in a clustering that has high purity but low collocation, that is, argument instances in each cluster tend to belong to the same role but argument instances of a particular role are scattered among many clusters.",
        "The algorithm then improves collocation by iteratively merging pairs of clusters.",
        "The agglomeration procedure is described in Algorithm 1.",
        "As can be seen, pairs of clusters are merged iteratively until a termination criterion is met.",
        "The decision of which cluster pair to merge at each step is made by scoring a set of candidate cluster pairs and choosing the highest one (line 5).",

        "In order to collect evidence for or against a merge, we take into account the connectivity of a cluster pair at each feature layer of the graph.",
        "This crucially involves aggregating over all edges that connect the two clusters, and allows us to infer a cluster-level similarity score from the individual instance-level similarities encoded in the edges.",
        "The evidence collected at each layer is then combined together in order to arrive at an overall decision (see Figure 1 for an illustration).",
        "3 We define the terms purity and collocation more formally in Section 5.4.",
        "641  Although it would be possible to enumerate and score all possible cluster pairs at each step, we apply a more efficient and effective procedure in which the set of candidates consists of pairs formed by combining a fixed cluster ci with all clusters c?j larger than ci.",
        "This requires comparing only O(|C|) rather than O(|C|2) scores and, more importantly, it favors merges between large clusters whose score can be computed more reliably.",
        "As mentioned earlier, our scoring function implements an averaging procedure over the instances contained in the clusters, and thus yields less noisy scores when clusters are large (i.e., contain many instances).",
        "This prioritization promotes reliable merges over less reliable ones in the earlier phases of the algorithm with a positive effect on merges in the later phases.",
        "Moreover, by keeping ci fixed, we only require that scores s(ci, x) and s(ci, z) are comparable (i.e., where one cluster is argument in both scores), rather than comparisons between arbitrary cluster pairs (e.g., s(w, x) and s(y, z)).",
        "In the following, we will provide details on the initialization of the algorithm and the computation of the similarity scoring function.",
        "A standard agglomerative clustering algorithm forms clusters bottom?up by initially placing each item of interest in its own cluster.",

        "Firstly, the scoring function we use is more reliable for larger clusters than for smaller clusters (see the subsequent discussion).",
        "In fact, the standard initialization that creates clusters with a single instance would not yield useful results as our scoring function crucially relies on initial clusters containing several instances on average.",
        "Secondly, the similarity scores for different features are not directly comparable.",
        "Recall from Section 3.1 that we introduced different types of similarities based on the arguments?",

        "In particular, it is difficult to weight the contribution of the two forms of positive evidence given by lexical and syntactic similarity.",
        "This motivates the idea of using syntactic similarity for initialization, and lexical similarity (as well as the frame constraint) for scoring.",
        "This separation avoids the difficulty of defining the exact interaction between the two.",

        "We specify the syntactic position of an argument using four cues: the verb's voice (active/passive), the argument's linear position relative to the predicate (left/right), the syntactic relation of the argument to its governor (e.g., subject or object), and the preposition used for realizing the argument (if any).",
        "Each argument is assigned a four-tuple consisting of these cues and two syntactic positions are assumed equal iff they agree on all cues.",
        "Whereas the similarity functions defined in Section 3.1 measure role-semantic similarity between instances on a particular feature, the scoring function measures role-semantic similarity between clusters.",

        "Edges can cross, allowing local and non-local dependencies to be encoded in a uniform way and eliminating the need for traces.",
        "This approach has significant advantages for non-configurational languages such as German, which exhibit a rich inventory of discontinuous constituents and considerable freedom with respect to word order (Smith 2003).",
        "Compared with the Penn TreeBank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993), tree structures are relatively flat.",

        "6.2 Experimental Set-up Although we follow the same experimental set-up as described in Section 5 for En-glish, there are some deviations due to differences in the data sets utilized for the two languages.",

        "Moreover, because adjunct arguments are not annotated in SALSA, and because argument identification is not the central issue of this work, we chose to also consider only the gold argument identification.",
        "Thus, all our experiments for German were carried out on the gold/gold data set.",
        "A substantial linguistic difference between the German and English data sets is the sparsity of the argument head lemmas, which is significantly higher for German than for English: In the CoNLL 2008 data set, the average number of distinct head lemmas per verb is only 3.69, whereas in the SALSA data set it is 20.12.",
        "This is partly due to the fact that the Wall Street Journal text underlying the English data is topically more focused than the Rundschau newspaper text, which covers a broader range of news beyond economics and politics.",

        "Specifically, only the syntactic position and function word served as cues to initialize our clusters.",
        "Note that, as in English, the relatively small number of syntactic cues that determine the syntactic position within a linking is a consequence of the size of our evaluation data set (which is rather small) and not an inherent limitation of our method.",
        "On larger data sets, more syntactic cues could and should be incorporated in order to increase performance.",

        "Conclusions In this article we described an unsupervised method for semantic role induction in which argument-instance graphs are partitioned into clusters representing semantic roles.",
        "A major hypothesis underlying our work has been that semantic roles can be induced without human supervision from a corpus of syntactically parsed sentences based on three linguistic principles : (1) arguments in the same syntactic position (within a specific linking) bear the same semantic role, (2) arguments within a clause bear a unique role, and (3) clusters representing the same semantic role should be more or less lexically and distributionally equivalent.",
        "Based on these principles we have formulated a similarity-driven model and introduced a multi-layer graph partitioning approach that represents similarity between clusters on multiple feature layers, whose connectivity can be analyzed separately and then combined into an overall cluster-similarity score.",
        "Our work has challenged the established view that supervised learning is the method of choice for the semantic role labeling task.",
        "Although the proposed unsupervised models do yet achieve results comparable to their supervised counterparts, we have been able to show that they consistently outperform the syntactic baseline across several data sets that combine automatic and gold parses, with gold and automatic argument identification in English and German.",
        "Our methods obtain F1 scores that are systematically above the baseline and the purity of the induced clusters is considerably higher, although in most cases this increase in purity is achieved by decreasing collocation.",
        "In sum, these results provide strong empirical evidence towards the soundness of our method and the principles they are based on.",
        "In terms of modeling, we have contributed to the body of work on similarity-driven models by demonstrating their suitability for this problem, their effectiveness, 665  and their computational efficiency.",
        "The models are based on judgments regarding the similarity of argument instances with respect to their semantic roles.",
        "We showed that these judgments are comparatively simple to formulate and incorporate into a graph representation of the data.",
        "We have introduced the idea of separating different similarity features into different graph layers, which resolves the problem faced by many similarity-based approaches of having to heuristically define an instance-wise similarity function and brings the advantage that cluster similarities can be computed in a more principled way.",
        "Beyond semantic role labeling, we hope that the multi-layered graph representation described here might be of relevance to other unsupervised problems such part-of-speech tagging or coreference resolution.",
        "The approach is general and amenable to other graph partitioning algorithms besides agglomeration and label propagation.",
        "There are two forms of data sparsity that arise in the context of our work, namely, the lexical sparsity of argument head lemmas and the sparsity of specific combinations of linking and syntactic position.",
        "As our methods are unsupervised, the conceptually simple solution to sparsity is to train on larger data sets.",
        "Because, with some modifica-tions, our graph partitioning approaches could be scaled to larger data sets (in terms of orders of magnitude), this is an obvious next step and would address both instances of data sparsity.",
        "Firstly, it would allow us to incorporate a richer set of syntactic features for initialization and would therefore necessarily result in initial clusterings of higher purity.",
        "Secondly, the larger size of clusters would result in more reliable similarity scores.",
        "Augmenting the data set would therefore almost surely increase the quality of induced clusterings; however, we leave this to future work.",
        "Another interesting future direction would be to eliminate the model's reliance on a syntactic parser that prohibits its application to languages for which parsing resources are not available.",
        "It would therefore be worthwhile, albeit challenging, to build models that operate on more readily available forms of syntactic analysis or even raw text.",
        "For example, existing work (Abend and Rappoport 2010b; Abend, Reichart, and Rappoport 2009) attempts to identify arguments and distinguish them into core and adjunct ones through unsupervised part of speech and grammar induction.",
        "As much as making our model more unsupervised it would also be interesting to see whether some form of weak supervision might help induce higher-quality semantic roles without incurring a major labeling effort.",
        "The ideas conveyed in this article and the proposed methods extend naturally to this setting: Introducing labels on some of the graph vertices would translate into a semi-supervised graph-based learning task, akin to Zhu, Ghahramani, and Lafferty (2003).",
