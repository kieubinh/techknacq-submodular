        "Discourse structure describes the high-level organization of text or speech.",
        "It is central to a number of high-impact applications, such as text summarization (Louis et al., 2010), sentiment analysis (Voll and Taboada, 2007; Somasun-daran et al., 2009), question answering (Ferrucci et al., 2010), and automatic evaluation of student writing (Miltsakaki and Kukich, 2004; Burstein et al., 2013).",
        "Hierarchical discourse representations such as Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) are particularly useful because of the computational applicability of tree-shaped discourse structures (Taboada and Mann, 2006), as shown in Figure 1.",
        "Unfortunately, the performance of discourse parsing is still relatively weak: the state-of-the-art F-measure for text-level relation detection in the RST Treebank is only slightly above 55% (Joty when profit was $107.8 million on sales of $435.5 million.",
        "The projections are in the neighborhood of 50 cents a share to 75 cents, compared with a restated $1.65 a share a year earlier, CIRCUMSTANCE COMPARISON Figure 1: An example of RST discourse structure.",
        "et al., 2013).",
        "While recent work has introduced increasingly powerful features (Feng and Hirst, 2012) and inference techniques (Joty et al., 2013), discourse relations remain hard to detect, due in part to a long tail of ?alternative lexicalizations?",
        "that can be used to realize each relation (Prasad et al., 2010).",
        "Surface and syntactic features are not capable of capturing what are fundamentally semantic distinctions, particularly in the face of relatively small annotated training sets.",
        "In this paper, we present a representation learning approach to discourse parsing.",
        "The core idea of our work is to learn a transformation from a bag-of-words surface representation into a latent space in which discourse relations are easily identifiable.",
        "The latent representation for each discourse unit can be viewed as a discriminatively-trained vector-space representation of its meaning.",
        "Alternatively, our approach can be seen as a non-linear learning algorithm for incremental structure prediction, which overcomes feature sparsity through effective parameter tying.",
        "We consider several alternative methods for transforming the original features, corresponding to different ideas of the meaning and role of the latent representation.",
        "Our method is implemented as a shift-reduce discourse parser (Marcu, 1999; Sagae, 2009).",
        "Learning is performed as large-margin transition-based structure prediction (Taskar et al., 2003), while at the same time jointly learning to project the surface representation into latent space.",
        "The 13 resulting system strongly outperforms the prior state-of-the-art at labeled F-measure, obtaining raw improvements of roughly 6% on relation labels and 2.5% on nuclearity.",
        "In addition, we show that the latent representation coheres well with the characterization of discourse connectives in the Penn Discourse Treebank (Prasad et al., 2008).",
        "2 Model The core idea of this paper is to project lexical features into a latent space that facilitates discourse parsing.",
        "In this way, we can capture the meaning of each discourse unit, without suffering from the very high dimensionality of a lexical representation.",
        "While such feature learning approaches have proven to increase robustness for parsing, POS tagging, and NER (Miller et al., 2004; Koo et al., 2008; Turian et al., 2010), they would seem to have an especially promising role for discourse, where training data is relatively sparse and ambiguity is considerable.",
        "Prasad et al. (2010) show that there is a long tail of alternative lexicalizations for discourse relations in the Penn Discourse Tree-bank, posing obvious challenges for approaches based on directly matching lexical features observed in the training data.",
        "Based on this observation, our goal is to learn a function that transforms lexical features into a much lower-dimensional latent representation, while simultaneously learning to predict discourse structure based on this latent representation.",
        "In this paper, we consider a simple transformation function, linear projection.",
        "Thus, we name the approach DPLP: Discourse Parsing from Linear Projection.",
        "We apply transition-based (incremental) structured prediction to obtain a discourse parse, training a predictor to make the correct incremental moves to match the annotations of training data in the RST Treebank.",
        "This supervision signal is then used to learn both the weights and the projection matrix in a large-margin framework.",
        "2.1 Shift-reduce discourse parsing We construct RST Trees using shift-reduce pars-ing, as first proposed by Marcu (1999).",
        "At each point in the parsing process, we maintain a stack and a queue; initially the stack is empty and the first elementary discourse unit (EDU) in the document is at the front of the queue.",

        "The reduction operation must choose both the type of relation and which element will be the nucleus.",
        "So, overall there are multiple reduce operations with specific relation types and nucleus positions.",
        "Shift-reduce parsing can be learned as a classification task, where the classifier uses features of the elements in the stack and queue to decide what move to take.",
        "Previous work has employed decision trees (Marcu, 1999) and the averaged percep-tron (Collins and Roark, 2004; Sagae, 2009) for this purpose.",
        "Instead, we employ a large-margin classifier, because we can compute derivatives of the margin-based objective function with respect to both the classifier weights as well as the projection matrix.",
        "2.2 Discourse parsing with projected features More formally, we denote the surface feature vocabulary V , and represent each EDU as the numeric vector v ?",
        "N V , where V = #|V| and the nth element of v is the count of the n-th surface feature in this EDU (see Table 1 for a summary of no-tation).",
        "During shift-reduce parsing, we consider features of three EDUs: 2 the top two elements on based approaches can achieve a segmentation F-measure of 94% (Hernault et al., 2010); a more complex rerank-ing model does slightly better, at 95% F-Measure with automatically-generated parse trees, and 96.6% with gold annotated trees (Xuan Bach et al., 2012).",
        "Human agreement reaches 98% F-Measure.",
        "2 After applying a reduce operation, the stack will include a span that contains multiple EDUs.",
        "We follow the strong 14 the stack (v 1 and v 2 ), and the front of the queue (v 3 ).",

        "The score for class m (in our case, the value of taking the m-th shift-reduce operation) is computed by the inner product w > m f(v;A).",
        "The specific shift-reduce operation is chosen by maximizing the decision value in Equation 1.",
        "The representation function f(v;A) can be defined in any form; for example, it could be a non-linear function defined by a neural network model parametrized by A.",

        "However, the learning problem is considerably different.",
        "If there are C total classes (possible shift-reduce op-erations), then a linear classifier must learn 3V C parameters, while DPLP must learn (3V + C)K parameters, which will be smaller under the assumption that K < C V .",

        "v 2 );C(v 1 ?v 3 )], representing the difference between the top two EDUs on the stack, and between the top EDU on the stack and the first EDU in the queue.",
        "This is intended to capture semantic similarity, so that reductions between related EDUs will be preferred.",
