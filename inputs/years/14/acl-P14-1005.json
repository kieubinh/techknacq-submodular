        "This paper studies and extends previous work using the structured perceptron (Collins, 2002) for complex NLP tasks.",
        "We show that for the task of coreference resolution the straightforward combination of beam search and early update (Collins and Roark, 2004) falls short of more limited feature sets that allow for exact search.",
        "This contrasts with previous work on, e.g., syntactic parsing (Collins and Roark, 2004; Huang, 2008; Zhang and Clark, 2008) and linearization (Bohnet et al., 2011), and even simpler structured prediction problems, where early updates are not even nec-essary, such as part-of-speech tagging (Collins, 2002) and named entity recognition (Ratinov and Roth, 2009).",
        "The main reason why early updates underper-form in our setting is that the task is too difficult and that the learning algorithm is not able to profit from all training data.",
        "Put another way, early updates happen too early, and the learning algorithm rarely reaches the end of the instances as it halts, updates, and moves on to the next instance.",
        "An alternative would be to continue decoding the same instance after the early updates, which is equivalent to Learning as Search Optimization (LaSO; Daum?e III and Marcu (2005b)).",
        "The learning task we are tackling is however further complicated since the target structure is under-determined by the gold standard annotation.",
        "Coreferent mentions in a document are usually annotated as sets of mentions, where all mentions in a set are coreferent.",
        "We adopt the recently popularized approach of inducing a latent structure within these sets (Fernandes et al., 2012; Chang et al., 2013; Durrett and Klein, 2013).",
        "This approach provides a powerful boost to the performance of coreference resolvers, but we find that it does not combine well with the LaSO learning strategy.",
        "We therefore propose a modification to LaSO, which delays updates until after each instance.",
        "The combination of this modification with non-local features leads to further improvements in the clustering accuracy, as we show in evaluation results on all languages from the CoNLL 2012 Shared Task ?",
        "Arabic, Chinese, and English.",
        "We obtain the best results to date on these data sets.",
        "1 2 Background Coreference resolution is the task of grouping referring expressions (or mentions) in a text into disjoint clusters such that all mentions in a cluster refer to the same entity.",
        "An example is given in Figure 1 below, where mentions from two clusters are marked with brackets: [Drug Emporium Inc.] a 1 said [Gary Wilber] b 1 was named CEO of [this drugstore chain] a 2 .",
        "[He] b 2 succeeds his father, Philip T. Wilber, who founded [the company] a 3 and remains chairman.",
        "Robert E. Lyons III, who headed the [company] a 4 's Philadelphia re-gion, was appointed president and chief operating offi-cer, succeeding [Gary Wilber] b 3 .",

        "uni-stuttgart.de/ ?",
        "anders/coref.html 47 In recent years much work on coreference resolution has been devoted to increasing the ex-pressivity of the classical mention-pair model, in which each coreference classification decision is limited to information about two mentions that make up a pair.",
        "This shortcoming has been addressed by entity-mention models, which relate a candidate mention to the full cluster of mentions predicted to be coreferent so far (for more discussion on the model types, see, e.g., (Ng, 2010)).",
        "Nevertheless, the two best systems in the latest CoNLL Shared Task on coreference resolution (Pradhan et al., 2012) were both variants of the mention-pair model.",
        "While the second best system (Bj?orkelund and Farkas, 2012) followed the widely used baseline of Soon et al. (2001), the winning system (Fernandes et al., 2012) proposed the use of a tree representation.",
        "The tree-based model of Fernandes et al. (2012) construes the representation of coreference clusters as a rooted tree.",
        "Figure 2 displays an example tree over the clusters from Figure 1.",
        "Every mention corresponds to a node in the tree, and arcs between mentions indicate that they are coreferent.",
        "The tree additionally has a dummy root node.",
        "Every subtree under the root node corresponds to a cluster of coreferent mentions.",
        "Since coreference training data is typically not annotated with trees, Fernandes et al. (2012) proposed the use of latent trees that are induced during the training phase of a coreference resolver.",
        "The latent tree provides more meaningful antecedents for training.",
        "2 For instance, the popular pair-wise instance creation method suggested by Soon et al. (2001) assumes non-branching trees, where the antecedent of every mention is its linear predecessor (i.e., he b 2 is the antecedent of Gary Wilber b 3 ).",
        "Comparing the two alternative antecedents of Gary Wilber b 3 , the tree in Figure 2 provides a more reliable basis for training a coreference resolver, as the two mentions of Gary Wilber are both proper names and have an exact string match.",
        "3 Representation and Learning LetM = {m 0 ,m 1 , ...,m n } denote the set of mentions in a document, including the artificial root mention (denoted by m 0 ).",
        "We assume that the 2 We follow standard practice and overload the terms anaphor and antecedent to be any type of mention, i.e., names as well as pronouns.",
        "An antecedent is simply the mention to the left of the anaphor.",

        "3 For each mention m j , let A j denote the set of potential antecedents.",

        "Fi-nally, let A denote the set of all antecedent sets {A 0 , A 1 , ..., A n }.",
        "In the tree model, each mention corresponds to a node, and an antecedent-anaphor pair ?a i ,m i ?, where a i ?",
        "A i , corresponds to a directed edge (or arc) pointing from antecedent to anaphor.",

        "By treating the mentions as nodes in a directed graph and assigning scores to the arcs according to (1), Fernandes et al. (2012) solved the search problem using the Chu-Liu-Edmonds (CLE) algorithm (Chu and Liu, 1965; 3 We impose a total order on mentions.",
        "In case of nested mentions, the mention that begins first is assumed to precede the embedded one.",
        "If two mentions begin at the same token, the longer one is taken to precede the shorter one.",
        "48 Edmonds, 1967), which is a maximum spanning tree algorithm that finds the optimal tree over a connected directed graph.",
        "CLE, however, has the drawback that the scores of the arcs must remain fixed and can not change depending on other arcs and it is not clear how to include non-local features in a CLE decoder.",
        "3.1 Online learning We find the weight vector w by online learning using a variant of the structured perceptron (Collins, 2002).",
        "Specifically, we use the passive-aggressive (PA) algorithm (Crammer et al., 2006), since we found that this performed slightly better in preliminary experiments.",

        "is set to 1, the update reduces to the standard structured perceptron update.",
        "The loss function can be an arbitrarily complex function that returns a numerical value of how bad the prediction is.",
        "In the simplest case, Hamming loss can be used, i.e., for each incorrect arc add 1.",
        "We follow Fernandes et al. (2012) and penalize erroneous root attach-ments, i.e., mentions that erroneously get the root node as their antecedent, with a loss of 1.5.",
        "For all other arcs we use Hamming loss.",
        "4 Incremental Search We now show that the search problem in (2) can equivalently be solved by the more intuitive best-first decoder (Ng and Cardie, 2002), rather than using the CLE decoder.",
        "The best-first decoder 49 works incrementally by making a left-to-right pass over the mentions, selecting for each mention the highest scoring antecedent.",
        "The key aspect that makes the best-first decoder equivalent to the CLE decoder is that all arcs point from left to right, both in this paper and in the work of Fernandes et al. (2012).",
        "We sketch a proof that this decoder also returns the highest scoring tree.",
        "First, note that this algorithm indeed returns a tree.",
        "This can be shown by assuming the opposite, in which case the tree has to have a cycle.",
        "Then there must be a mention that has its antecedent to the right.",
        "Though this is not possible since all arcs point from left to right.",
        "Second, this tree is the highest scoring tree.",
        "Again, assume the contrary, i.e., that there is a higher scoring tree in Y(A).",
        "This implies that for some mention there is a higher scoring antecedent than the one selected by the decoder.",
        "This contradicts the fact that the best-first decoder selects the highest scoring antecedent for each mention.",
        "5 5 Introducing Non-local Features Since the best-first decoder makes a left-to-right pass, it is possible to extract features on the partial structure on the left.",
        "Such non-local features are able to capture information beyond that of a mention and its potential antecedent, e.g., the size of a partially built cluster, or features extracted from the antecedent of the antecedent.",
        "When only local features are used, greedy search (either with CLE or the best-first decoder) suffices to find the highest scoring tree.",
        "That is, greedy search provides an exact solution to equation 2.",
        "Non-local features, however, render the exact search problem intractable.",
        "This is because with non-local features, locally suboptimal (i.e., non-greedy) antecedents for some mentions may lead to a higher total score over a whole document.",
        "In order to keep some options around during search, we extend the best-first decoder with beam search.",
        "Beam search works incrementally by keeping an agenda of state items.",
        "At each step, all items on the agenda are expanded.",
        "The subset of size k (the beam size) of the highest scoring expansions are retained and put back into the agenda for the next step.",
        "The feature extraction function ?",
        "5 In case there are multiple maximum spanning trees, the best-first decoder will return one of them.",
        "This also holds for the CLE algorithm.",
        "With proper definitions, the proof can be constructed to show that both search algorithms return trees belonging to the set of maximum spanning trees over a graph.",
        "is also extended such that it also receives the current state s as an argument: ?",
        "(?m i ,m j ?, s).",
        "The state encodes the previous decisions and enables ?",
        "to extract features from the partial tree on the left.",
        "We now outline three different ways of learning the weight vector w with non-local features.",
        "5.1 Early updates The beam search decoder can be plugged into the training algorithm, replacing the calls to arg max.",
        "Since state items leading to the best tree may be pruned from the agenda before the decoder reaches the end of the document, the introduction of non-local features may cause the decoder to return a non-optimal tree.",
        "This is problematic as it might cause updates although the correct tree has a higher score than the predicted one.",
        "It has previously been observed (Huang et al., 2012) that substantial gains can be made by applying an early update strategy (Collins and Roark, 2004): if the correct item is pruned before reaching the end of the document, then stop and update.",
        "While beam search and early updates have been successfully applied to other NLP applications, our task differs in two important aspects: First, coreference resolution is a much more difficult task, which relies on more (world) knowledge than what is available in the training data.",
        "In other words, it is unlikely that we can devise a feature set that is informative enough to allow the weight vector to converge towards a solution that lets the learning algorithm see the entire documents during training, at least in the situation when no external knowledge sources are used.",
        "Second, our gold structure is not known but is induced latently, and may vary from iteration to iteration.",
        "With non-local features this is troublesome since the best latent tree of a complete document may not necessarily coincide with the best partial tree at some intermediate mentionm j , j < n, i.e., a mention before the last in a document.",
        "We therefore also apply beam search to find the latent tree to have a partial gold structure for every mention in a document.",
        "Algorithm 2 shows pseudocode for the beam search and early update training procedure.",
        "The algorithm maintains two parallel agendas, one for gold items and one for predicted items.",
        "At every mention, both agendas are expanded and thus cover the same set of mentions.",
        "Then the predicted agenda is checked to see if it contains any correct 50 Algorithm 2 Beam search and early update Input: Data set D, epochs T , beam size k Output: weight vector w 1: w = ??",

        "If there is no correct item in the predicted agenda, search is halted and an update is made against the best item from the gold agenda.",
        "The algorithm then moves on to the next document.",
        "If the end of a document is reached, the top scoring predicted item is checked for correctness.",
        "If it is not, an update is made against the best gold item.",
        "A drawback of early updates is that the remainder of the document is skipped when an early update is applied, effectively discarding some training data.",
        "6 An alternative strategy that makes better use of the training data is to apply the max-violation procedure suggested by Huang et al. (2012).",
        "However, since our gold trees change from iteration to iteration, and even inside of a single document, it is not entirely clear with respect to what gold tree the maximum violation should be computed.",
        "Initial experiments with max-violation updates indicated that they did not improve much over early updates, and also had a tendency to only consider a smaller portion of the training data.",
        "5.2 LaSO To make full use of the training data we implemented Learning as Search Optimization (LaSO; Daum?e III and Marcu, 2005b).",
        "It is very similar to early updates, but differs in one crucial respect: When an early update is made, search is continued rather than aborted.",
        "Thus the learning algorithm always reaches the end of a document, avoiding the problem that early updates discard parts of the training data.",
        "6 In fact, after 50 iterations about 70% of the mentions in the training data are still being ignored due to early updates.",
        "Correct items are computed the same way as with early updates, where an agenda of gold items is maintained in parallel.",
        "When search is resumed after an intermediate LaSO update, the prediction agenda is re-seeded with gold items (i.e., items that are all correct).",
        "This is necessary since the update influences what the partial gold structure looks like, and the gold agenda therefore needs to be recreated from the beginning of the document.",
        "Specifically, after each intermediate LaSO update, the gold agenda is expanded repeatedly from the beginning of the document to the point where the update was made, and is then copied over to seed the prediction agenda.",
        "In terms of pseudocode, this is accomplished by replacing lines 12 and 13 in Algorithm 2 with the following: 12: update .",
        "PA update 13: Agenda G = {} 14: for m i ?",

        "Continue 5.3 Delayed LaSO updates When we applied LaSO, we noticed that it performed worse than the baseline learning algorithm when only using local features.",
        "We believe that the reason is that updates are made in the middle of documents which means that lexical forms of antecedents are ?fresh in memory?",
        "of the weight vector.",
        "This results in fewer mistakes during training and leads to fewer updates.",
        "While this feedback makes it easier during training, such feedback is not available during test time, and the LaSO learning setting therefore mimics the testing setting to a lesser extent.",
        "We also found that LaSO updates change the shape of the latent tree and that the average distance between mentions connected by an arc increased.",
        "This problem can also be attributed to how lexical items are fresh in memory.",
        "Such trees tend to deviate from the intuition that the latent trees are easier to learn.",
        "They also render distance-based features (which are standard practice and generally rather useful) less powerful, as distance in sentences or mentions becomes less of a reliable indicator for coreference.",
        "To cope with this problem, we devised the delayed LaSO update, which differs from LaSO only in the respect that it postpones the actual updates until the end of a document.",

        "The exact definitions and feature sets that we use are available as part of the download package of our system.",
        "6.1 Local features Basic features that can be extracted on one or both mentions in a pair include (among oth-ers): Mention type, which is either root, pro-noun, name, or common; Distance features, e.g., the distance in sentences or mentions; Rule-based features, e.g., StringMatch or SubStringMatch; Syntax-based features, e.g., category labels or paths in the syntax tree; Lexical features, e.g., the head word of a mention or the last word of a mention.",
        "In order to have a strong local baseline, we applied greedy forward/backward feature selection on the training data using a large set of local feature templates.",
        "Specifically, the training set of each language was split into two parts where 75% was used for training, and 25% for testing.",
        "Feature templates were incrementally added or removed in order to optimize the mean of MUC, B 3 , and CEAF e (i.e., the CoNLL average).",
        "6.2 Non-local Features We experimented with non-local features drawn from previous work on entity-mention models (Luo et al., 2004; Rahman and Ng, 2009), however they did not improve performance in preliminary experiments.",
        "The one exception is the size of a cluster (Culotta et al., 2007).",

        "of a cluster in terms of mention type.",
        "For instance, the clusters representing Gary Wilber and Drug Emporium Inc. from the example in Figure 1, would be represented as RNPN and RNCCC, respectively.",
        "Where R, N, P, and C denote the root node, names, pro-nouns, and common noun phrases, respectively.",
        "Local syntactic context is inspired by the Entity Grid (Barzilay and Lapata, 2008), where the basic assumption is that references to an entity follow particular syntactic patterns.",
        "For instance, an entity may be introduced as an object in one sen-tence, whereas in subsequent sentences it is referred to in subject position.",
        "Grammatical functions are approximated by the path in the syntax tree from a mention to its closest S node.",
        "The partial paths of a mention and its linear predecessor, given the cluster of the current antecedent, informs the model about the local syntactic context.",
        "Cluster start distance denotes the distance in mentions from the beginning of the document where the cluster of the antecedent in consideration begins.",
        "Additionally, the non-local model also has access to the basic properties of other mentions in the partial tree structure, such as head words.",

        "We evaluate our system using the CoNLL 2012 scorer, which computes several coreference met-rics: MUC (Vilain et al., 1995), B 3 (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998), and CEAF e and CEAF m (Luo, 2005).",

        "Note that plain LaSO with non-local features only barely outperforms the delayed LaSO with only local features (i.e., the baseline), which indicates that only delayed LaSO is able to fully leverage non-local features.",

        "Our approach also resembles imitation learning techniques such as SEARN (Daum?e III et al., 2009) and DAGGER (Ross et al., 2011), where the search problem is reduced to a sequence of classification steps that guide the search algorithm through the search space.",
