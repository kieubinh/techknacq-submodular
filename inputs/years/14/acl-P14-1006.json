        "Distributed representations of words provide the basis for many state-of-the-art approaches to various problems in natural language processing today.",
        "Such word embeddings are naturally richer representations than those of symbolic or discrete models, and have been shown to be able to capture both syntactic and semantic information.",
        "Successful applications of such models include language modelling (Bengio et al., 2003), paraphrase detection (Erk and Pad√≥, 2008), and dialogue analysis (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013).",
        "Within a monolingual context, the distributional hypothesis (Firth, 1957) forms the basis of most approaches for learning word representations.",
        "In Figure 1: Model with parallel input sentences a and b. The model minimises the distance between the sentence level encoding of the bitext.",
        "Any composition functions (CVM) can be used to generate the compositional sentence level representations.",
        "this work, we extend this hypothesis to multilingual data and joint-space embeddings.",
        "We present a novel unsupervised technique for learning semantic representations that leverages parallel corpora and employs semantic transfer through compositional representations.",
        "Unlike most methods for learning word representations, which are restricted to a single language, our approach learns to represent meaning across languages in a shared multilingual semantic space.",
        "We present experiments on two corpora.",
        "First, we show that for cross-lingual document classification on the Reuters RCV1/RCV2 corpora (Lewis et al., 2004), we outperform the prior state of the art (Klementiev et al., 2012).",
        "Second, we also present classification results on a massively multilingual corpus which we derive from the TED corpus (Cettolo et al., 2012).",
        "The results on this task, in comparison with a number of strong baselines, further demonstrate the relevance of our approach and the success of our method in learning multilingual semantic representations over a wide range of languages.",
        "58 2 Overview Distributed representation learning describes the task of learning continuous representations for discrete objects.",
        "Here, we focus on learning semantic representations and investigate how the use of multilingual data can improve learning such representations at the word and higher level.",
        "We present a model that learns to represent each word in a lexicon by a continuous vector in R d .",
        "Such distributed representations allow a model to share meaning between similar words, and have been used to capture semantic, syntactic and morphological content (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Turian et al., 2010, inter alia).",
        "We describe a multilingual objective function that uses a noise-contrastive update between semantic representations of different languages to learn these word embeddings.",
        "As part of this, we use a compositional vector model (CVM, hence-forth) to compute semantic representations of sentences and documents.",
        "A CVM learns semantic representations of larger syntactic units given the semantic representations of their constituents (Clark and Pulman, 2007; Mitchell and Lapata, 2008; Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011; Socher et al., 2012; Hermann and Blunsom, 2013, inter alia).",
        "A key difference between our approach and those listed above is that we only require sentence-aligned parallel data in our otherwise unsupervised learning function.",
        "This removes a number of constraints that normally come with CVM mod-els, such as the need for syntactic parse trees, word alignment or annotated data as a training signal.",
        "At the same time, by using multiple CVMs to transfer information between languages, we enable our models to capture a broader semantic context than would otherwise be possible.",
        "The idea of extracting semantics from multilingual data stems from prior work in the field of semantic grounding.",
        "Language acquisition in humans is widely seen as grounded in sensory-motor experience (Bloom, 2001; Roy, 2003).",
        "Based on this idea, there have been some attempts at using multi-modal data for learning better vector representations of words (e.g. Srivastava and Salakhutdinov (2012)).",
        "Such methods, however, are not easily scalable across languages or to large amounts of data for which no secondary or tertiary representation might exist.",
        "Parallel data in multiple languages provides an alternative to such secondary representations, as parallel texts share their semantics, and thus one language can be used to ground the other.",
        "Some work has exploited this idea for transferring linguistic knowledge into low-resource languages or to learn distributed representations at the word level (Klementiev et al., 2012; Zou et al., 2013; Lauly et al., 2013, inter alia).",
        "So far almost all of this work has been focused on learning multilingual representations at the word level.",
        "As distributed representations of larger expressions have been shown to be highly useful for a number of tasks, it seems to be a natural next step to attempt to induce these, too, cross-lingually.",
        "3 Approach Most prior work on learning compositional semantic representations employs parse trees on their training data to structure their composition functions (Socher et al., 2012; Hermann and Blun-som, 2013, inter alia).",
        "Further, these approaches typically depend on specific semantic signals such as sentiment-or topic-labels for their objective functions.",
        "While these methods have been shown to work in some cases, the need for parse trees and annotated data limits such approaches to resource-fortunate languages.",
        "Our novel method for learning compositional vectors removes these require-ments, and as such can more easily be applied to low-resource languages.",
        "Specifically, we attempt to learn semantics from multilingual data.",
        "The idea is that, given enough parallel data, a shared representation of two parallel sentences would be forced to capture the common elements between these two sentences.",
        "What parallel sentences share, of course, are their semantics.",
        "Naturally, different languages express meaning in different ways.",
        "We utilise this diversity to abstract further from mono-lingual surface realisations to deeper semantic representations.",
        "We exploit this semantic similarity across languages by defining a bilingual (and trivially multilingual) energy as follows.",
        "Assume two functions f : X ?",
        "R d and g : Y ?",
        "R d , which map sentences from languages x and y onto distributed semantic representations in R d .",
        "Given a parallel corpus C, we then define the energy of the model given two sentences (a, b) ?",
        "C as: E bi (a, b) = ?f(a)?",
        "g(b)?",
        "2 (1) 59 We want to minimize E bi for all semantically equivalent sentences in the corpus.",
        "In order to prevent the model from degenerating, we further introduce a noise-constrastive large-margin update which ensures that the representations of non-aligned sentences observe a certain margin from each other.",
        "For every pair of parallel sentences (a, b) we sample a number of additional sentence pairs (?, n) ?",
        "C, where n?with high probability -- is not semantically equivalent to a.",
        "We use these noise samples as follows: E hl (a, b, n) = [m+ E bi (a, b)?",
        "E bi (a, n)] + where [x] + = max(x, 0) denotes the standard hinge loss and m is the margin.",
        "This results in the following objective function: J(?)",
        "= ?",
        "(a,b)?C ( k ?",
        "i=1 E hl (a, b, n i ) + ?",
        "2 ???",
        "2 ) (2) where ?",
        "is the set of all model variables.",
        "3.1 Two Composition Models The objective function in Equation 2 could be coupled with any two given vector composition functions f, g from the literature.",
        "As we aim to apply our approach to a wide range of languages, we focus on composition functions that do not require any syntactic information.",
        "We evaluate the following two composition functions.",
        "The first model, ADD, represents a sentence by the sum of its word vectors.",
        "This is a distributed bag-of-words approach as sentence ordering is not taken into account by the model.",
        "Second, the BI model is designed to capture bigram information, using a non-linearity over bigram pairs in its composition function: f(x) = n ?",
        "i=1 tanh (x i?1 + x i ) (3) The use of a non-linearity enables the model to learn interesting interactions between words in a document, which the bag-of-words approach of ADD is not capable of learning.",
        "We use the hyperbolic tangent as activation function.",
        "3.2 Document-level Semantics For a number of tasks, such as topic modelling, representations of objects beyond the sentence level are required.",
        "While most approaches to compositional distributed semantics end at the word Figure 2: Description of a parallel document-level compositional vector model (DOC).",
        "The model recursively computes semantic representations for each sentence of a document and then for the document itself, treating the sentence vectors as inputs for a second CVM.",
        "level, our model extends to document-level learning quite naturally, by recursively applying the composition and objective function (Equation 2) to compose sentences into documents.",
        "This is achieved by first computing semantic representations for each sentence in a document.",
        "Next, these representations are used as inputs in a higher-level CVM, computing a semantic representation of a document (Figure 2).",
        "This recursive approach integrates document-level representations into the learning process.",
        "We can thus use corpora of parallel documents?",
        "regardless of whether they are sentence aligned or not?to propagate a semantic signal back to the individual words.",
        "If sentence alignment is avail-able, of course, the document-signal can simply be combined with the sentence-signal, as we did with the experiments described in ?5.3.",
        "This concept of learning compositional representations for documents contrasts with prior work (Socher et al., 2011; Klementiev et al., 2012, inter alia) who rely on summing or averaging sentence-vectors if representations beyond the sentence-level are required for a particular task.",
        "We evaluate the models presented in this paper both with and without the document-level signal.",
        "We refer to the individual models used as ADD and BI if used without, and as DOC/ADD and DOC/BI is used with the additional document composition function and error signal.",
        "4 Corpora We use two corpora for learning semantic representations and performing the experiments described in this paper.",
        "60 The Europarl corpus v7 1 (Koehn, 2005) was used during initial development and testing of our approach, as well as to learn the representations used for the Cross-Lingual Document Classification task described in ?5.2.",
        "We considered the English-German and English-French language pairs from this corpus.",
        "From each pair the final 100,000 sentences were reserved for development.",
        "Second, we developed a massively multilingual corpus based on the TED corpus 2 for IWSLT 2013 (Cettolo et al., 2012).",
        "This corpus contains English transcriptions and multilingual, sentence-aligned translations of talks from the TED conference.",
        "While the corpus is aimed at machine translation tasks, we use the keywords associated with each talk to build a subsidiary corpus for multilingual document classification as follows.",
        "3 The development sections provided with the IWSLT 2013 corpus were again reserved for development.",
        "We removed approximately 10 percent of the training data in each language to create a test corpus (all talks with id ?",
        "1,400).",
        "The new training corpus consists of a total of 12,078 parallel documents distributed across 12 language pairs 4 .",
        "In total, this amounts to 1,678,219 non-English sentences (the number of unique English sentences is smaller as many documents are translated into multiple languages and thus appear repeatedly in the corpus).",
        "Each document (talk) contains one or several keywords.",
        "We used the 15 most frequent keywords for the topic classification experiments described in section ?5.3.",
        "Both corpora were pre-processed using the set of tools provided by cdec 5 for tokenizing and low-ercasing the data.",
        "Further, all empty sentences and their translations were removed from the corpus.",
        "5 Experiments We report results on two experiments.",
        "First, we replicate the cross-lingual document classification task of Klementiev et al. (2012), learning distributed representations on the Europarl corpus and evaluating on documents from the Reuters RCV1/RCV2 corpora.",
        "Subsequently, we design a 1 http://www.statmt.org/europarl/ 2 https://wit3.fbk.eu/ 3 http://www.clg.ox.ac.uk/tedcldc/ 4 English to Arabic, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Romanian, Russian and Turkish.",

        "5 http://cdec-decoder.org/ multi-label classification task using the TED cor-pus, both for training and evaluating.",
        "The use of a wider range of languages in the second experiments allows us to better evaluate our models?",
        "capabilities in learning a shared multilingual semantic representation.",
        "We also investigate the learned embeddings from a qualitative perspective in ?5.4.",
        "5.1 Learning All model weights were randomly initialised using a Gaussian distribution (?=0, ?",
        "2 =0.1).",
        "We used the available development data to set our model parameters.",
        "For each positive sample we used a number of noise samples (k ?",
        "{1, 10, 50}), randomly drawn from the corpus at each training epoch.",
        "All our embeddings have dimensionality d=128, with the margin set to m=d.",
        "6 Further, we use L2 regularization with ?=1 and step-size in {0.01, 0.05}.",
        "We use 100 iterations for the RCV task, 500 for the TED single and 5 for the joint corpora.",
        "We use the adaptive gradient method, AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011), for updating the weights of our models, in a mini-batch setting (b ?",
        "{10, 50}).",
        "All settings, our model implementation and scripts to replicate our experiments are available at http://www.karlmoritz.com/.",
        "5.2 RCV1/RCV2 Document Classification We evaluate our models on the cross-lingual document classification (CLDC, henceforth) task first described in Klementiev et al. (2012).",
        "This task involves learning language independent embeddings which are then used for document classification across the English-German language pair.",
        "For this, CLDC employs a particular kind of supervision, namely using supervised training data in one language and evaluating without further supervision in another.",
        "Thus, CLDC can be used to establish whether our learned representations are semantically useful across multiple languages.",
        "We follow the experimental setup described in Klementiev et al. (2012), with the exception that we learn our embeddings using solely the Europarl data and use the Reuters corpora only during for classifier training and testing.",
        "Each document in the classification task is represented by the average of the d-dimensional representations of all its sentences.",
        "We train the multiclass classifier using an averaged perceptron (Collins, 2002) with the same settings as in Klementiev et al. (2012).",

        "In their simplest form, distributional information from large corpora can be used to learn embeddings, where the words appearing within a certain window of the target word are used to compute that word's embedding.",
        "This is related to topic-modelling techniques such as LSA (Dumais et al., 1988), LSI, and LDA (Blei et al., 2003), but these methods use a document-level context, and tend to capture the topics a word is used in rather than its more immediate syntactic context.",
        "Neural language models are another popular approach for inducing distributed word representations (Bengio et al., 2003).",
        "They have received a lot of attention in recent years (Collobert and We-ston, 2008; Mnih and Hinton, 2009; Mikolov et al., 2010, inter alia) and have achieved state of the art performance in language modelling.",
        "Collobert et al. (2011) further popularised using neural network architectures for learning word embeddings from large amounts of largely unlabelled data by showing the embeddings can then be used to improve standard supervised tasks.",
        "65 Unsupervised word representations can easily be plugged into a variety of NLP related tasks.",
        "Tasks, where the use of distributed representations has resulted in improvements include topic modelling (Blei et al., 2003) or named entity recognition (Turian et al., 2010; Collobert et al., 2011).",
        "Compositional Vector Models For a number of important problems, semantic representations of individual words do not suffice, but instead a semantic representation of a larger structure?e.g.",
        "a phrase or a sentence -- is required.",
        "Self-evidently, sparsity prevents the learning of such representations using the same collocational methods as applied to the word level.",
        "Most literature instead focuses on learning composition functions that represent the semantics of a larger structure as a function of the representations of its parts.",
        "Very simple composition functions have been shown to suffice for tasks such as judging bigram semantic similarity (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008).",
        "More complex composition functions using matrix-vector composition, convolutional neural networks or tensor composition have proved useful in tasks such as sentiment analysis (Socher et al., 2011; Hermann and Blunsom, 2013), relational similarity (Turney, 2012) or dialogue analysis (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013).",
