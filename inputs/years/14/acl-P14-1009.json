        "Abstract",
        "Distributional semantic methods to approximate word meaning with context vectors have been very successful empir-ically, and the last years have seen a surge of interest in their compositional extension to phrases and sentences.",
        "We present here a new model that, like those of Co-ecke et al. (2010) and Baroni and Zamparelli (2010), closely mimics the standard Montagovian semantic treatment of composition in distributional terms.",
        "However, our approach avoids a number of issues that have prevented the application of the earlier linguistically-motivated models to full-fledged, real-life sentences.",
        "We test the model on a variety of empirical tasks, showing that it consistently outperforms a set of competitive rivals.",
        "1 Compositional distributional semantics The research of the last two decades has established empirically that distributional vectors for words obtained from corpus statistics can be used to represent word meaning in a variety of tasks (Turney and Pantel, 2010).",
        "If distributional vectors encode certain aspects of word meaning, it is natural to expect that similar aspects of sentence meaning can also receive vector representations, obtained compositionally from word vectors.",
        "Developing a practical model of compositionality is still an open issue, which we address in this paper.",
        "One approach is to use simple, parameter-free models that perform operations such as point-wise multiplication or summing (Mitchell and La-pata, 2008).",
        "Such models turn out to be surprisingly effective in practice (Blacoe and Lapata, 2012), but they have obvious limitations.",
        "For instance, symmetric operations like vector addition are insensitive to syntactic structure, therefore meaning differences encoded in word order are lost in composition: pandas eat bamboo is identical to bamboo eats pandas.",
        "Guevara (2010), Mitchell and Lapata (2010), Socher et al. (2011) and Zanzotto et al. (2010) generalize the simple additive model by applying structure-encoding operators to the vectors of two sister nodes before addition, thus breaking the inherent symmetry of the simple additive model.",
        "A related approach (Socher et al., 2012) assumes richer lexical representations where each word is represented with a vector and a matrix that encodes its interaction with its syntactic sister.",
        "The training proposed in this model estimates the parameters in a supervised setting.",
        "Despite positive empirical evalua-tion, this approach is hardly practical for general-purpose semantic language processing, since it requires computationally expensive approximate parameter optimization techniques, and it assumes task-specific parameter learning whose results are not meant to generalize across tasks.",
        "1.1 The lexical function model None of the proposals mentioned above, from simple to elaborate, incorporates in its architecture the intuitive idea (standard in theoretical linguistics) that semantic composition is more than a weighted combination of words.",
        "Generally one of the components of a phrase, e.g., an adjective, acts as a function affecting the other component (e.g., a noun).",
        "This underlying intuition, adopted from formal semantics of natural language, motivated the creation of the lexical function model of composition (lf ) (Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Co-ecke et al., 2010).",
        "The lf model can be seen as a projection of the symbolic Montagovian approach to semantic composition in natural language onto the domain of vector spaces and linear operations on them (Baroni et al., 2013).",
        "In lf, arguments are vectors and functions taking arguments (e.g., adjectives that combine with nouns) are tensors, with the number of arguments (n) determining the 90 order of tensor (n+1).",
        "For example, adjectives, as unary functors, are modeled with 2-way tensors, or matrices.",
        "Tensor by vector multiplication formalizes function application and serves as the general composition method.",
        "Baroni and Zamparelli (2010) propose a practical and empirically effective way to estimate matrices representing adjectival modifiers of nouns by linear regression from corpus-extracted examples of noun and adjective-noun vectors.",
        "Unlike the neural network approach of Socher et al. (2011; 2012), the Baroni and Zamparelli method does not require manually labeled data nor costly iterative estimation procedures, as it relies on automatically extracted phrase vectors and on the analytical solution of the least-squares-error problem.",
        "The same method was later applied to matrix representations of intransitive verbs and determiners (Bernardi et al., 2013; Dinu et al., 2013), always with good empirical results.",
        "The full range of semantic types required for natural language processing, including those of adverbs and transitive verbs, has to include, how-ever, tensors of greater rank.",
        "The estimation method originally proposed by Baroni and Zamparelli has been extended to 3-way tensors representing transitive verbs by Grefenstette et al. (2013) with preliminary success.",
        "Grefenstette et al.'s method works in two steps.",
        "First, one estimates matrices of verb-object phrases from subject and subject-verb-object vectors; next, transitive verb tensors are estimated from verb-object matrices and object vectors.",
        "1.2 Problems with the extension of the lexical function model to sentences With all the advantages of lf, scaling it up to arbitrary sentences, however, leads to several issues.",
        "In particular, it is desirable for all practical purposes to limit representation size.",
        "For example, if noun meanings are encoded in vectors of 300 dimensions, adjectives become matrices of 300 2 cells, and transitive verbs are represented as tensors with 300 3 =27, 000, 000 dimensions.",
        "Estimating tensors of this size runs into data sparseness issues already for less common transitive verbs.",
        "Indeed, in order to train a transitive verb tensor (e.g., eat), the method of Grefenstette et al. (2013) requires a sufficient number of distinct verb object phrases with that verb (e.g., eat cake, eat fruits), each attested in combination with a certain number of subject nouns with sufficient frequency to extract sensible vectors.",
        "It is not feasible to obtain enough data points for all verbs in such a training design.",
        "Things get even worse for other categories.",
        "Adverbs like quickly that modify intransitive verbs have to be represented with 300 2 2 = 8, 100, 000, 000 dimensions.",
        "Modifiers of transitive verbs would have even greater representation size, which may not be possible to store and learn efficiently.",
        "Another issue is that the same or similar items that occur in different syntactic contexts are assigned different semantic types with incomparable representations.",
        "For example, verbs like eat can be used in transitive or intransitive constructions (children eat meat/children eat), or in passive (meat is eaten).",
        "Since predicate arity is encoded in the order of the corresponding tensor, eat and the like have to be assigned different representations (matrix or tensor) depending on the context.",
        "Deverbal nouns like demolition, often used without mention of who demolished what, would have to get vector representations while the corresponding verbs (demolish) would become tensors, which makes immediately related verbs and nouns incomparable.",
        "Nouns in general would oscillate between vector and matrix representations depending on argument vs. predicate vs. modifier position (an animal runs vs. this is an animal vs. animal shelter).",
        "Prepositions are the hardest, as the syntactic positions in which they occur are most diverse (park in the dark vs. play in the dark vs. be in the dark vs. a light glowing in the dark).",
        "In all those cases, the same word has to be mapped to tensors of different orders.",
        "Since each of these tensors must be learned from examples individually, their obvious relation is missed.",
        "Besides losing the comparability of the semantic contribution of a word across syntactic contexts, we also worsen the data sparseness issues.",
        "The last, and related, point is that for the tensor calculus to work, one needs to model, for each word, each of the constructions in the corpus that the word is attested in.",
        "In its pure form lf does not include an emergency backoff strategy when unknown words or constructions are encountered.",
        "For example, if we only observe transitive usages of to eat in the training corpus, and encounter an intransitive or passive example of it in testing data, 91 the system would not be able to compose a sentence vector at all.",
        "This issue is unavoidable since we don't expect to find all words in all possible constructions even in the largest corpus.",
        "2 The practical lexical function model As follows from section 1.2, it would be desirable to have a compositional distributional model that encodes function-argument relations but avoids the troublesome high-order tensor representations of the pure lexical function model, with all the practical problems that come with them.",
        "We may still want to represent word meanings in different syntactic contexts differently, but at the same time we need to incorporate a formal connection between those representations, e.g., between the transitive and the intransitive instantiations of the verb to eat.",
        "Last but not least, all items need to include a common aspect of their representation (e.g., a vector) to allow comparison across categories (the case of demolish and demolition).",
        "To this end, we propose a new model of composition that maintains the idea of function applica-tion, while avoiding the complications and rigidity of lf.",
        "We call our proposal practical lexical function model, or plf.",
        "In plf, a functional word is not represented by a single tensor of arity-dependent order, but by a vector plus an ordered set of matri-ces, with one matrix for each argument the function takes.",
        "After applying the matrices to the corresponding argument vectors, a single representation is obtained by summing across all resulting vectors.",
        "2.1 Word meaning representation In plf, all words are represented by a vector, and functional words, such as predicates and modi-fiers, are also assigned one or more matrices.",
        "The general form of a semantic representation for a linguistic unit is an ordered tuple of a vector and n ?",
        "N matrices: 1 ?",
        "~x, 2 1 x , .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", 2 n x ?",
        "The number of matrices in the representation encodes the arity of a linguistic unit, i.e., the number of other units to which it applies as a function.",
        "Each matrix corresponds to a function-argument relation, and words have as many matrices as many arguments they take: none for (most) nouns, 1 Matrices associated with term x are symbolized 2 x. dog ~ dog run ~run, 2 run chase ~ chase, 2 s chase, 2 o chase give ~ give, 2 s give, 2 o give, 2 io give big ~ big, 2 big very ~very, 2 n very, 2 a very quickly ~ quickly, 2 s quickly, 2 v quickly Table 1: Examples of word representations.",
        "Subscripts encode, just for mnemonic purposes, the constituent whose vector the matrix combines with: subject, object, indirect object, noun, adjective, verb phrase.",
        "one for adjectives and intransitive verbs, two for transitives, etc.",
        "The matrices formalize argument slot saturation, operating on an argument vector representation through matrix by vector multipli-cation, as described in the next section.",
        "Modifiers of n-ary functors are represented by n+1-ary structures.",
        "For instance, we treat adjectives that modify nouns (0-ary) as unary functions, encoded in a vector-matrix pair.",
        "Adverbs have different semantic types depending on their syntactic role.",
        "Sentential adverbs are unary, while adverbs that modify adjectives (very) or verb phrases (quickly) are encoded as binary functions, represented by a vector and two matrices.",
        "The form of semantic representations we are using is shown in Table 1.",
        "2 2.2 Semantic composition Our system incorporates semantic composition via two composition rules, one for combining structures of different arity and the other for symmetric composition of structures with the same ar-ity.",
        "These rules incorporate insights of two empirically successful models, lexical function and the simple additive approach, used as the default structure merging strategy.",
        "The first rule is function application, illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Table 2 illustrates simple cases of function application.",
        "For transitive verbs semantic composition applies iteratively as shown in the derivation of Figure 2.",
        "For ternary predicates such 2 To determine the number and ordering of matrices representing the word in the current syntactic context, our plf implementation relies on the syntactic type assigned to the word in the categorial grammar parse of the sentence.",

        "For example, since the copula is empty, a sentence with a predicative adjective (cars are red) is treated in the same way as a phrase with the same adjective in attributive position (red cars) ?",
        "although the latter, being a phrase and not a full sentence, will later be embedded as argument in a larger construction.",
        "Similarly, leaving the relative pronoun empty makes cars that run identical to cars run, although, again, the former will be embedded in a larger construction later in the derivation.",
        "We conclude our brief exposition of plf with an alternative intuition for it: the plf model is also a more sophisticated version of the additive ap-proach, where argument words are adapted by matrices that encode the relation to their functors before the sentence vector is derived by summing.",
        "2.3 Satisfying the desiderata Let us now outline how plf addresses the shortcomings of lf listed in Section 1.2.",
        "First, all issues caused by representation size disappear.",
        "An n-ary predicate is no longer encoded as an n+1-way tensor; instead we have a sequence of n matrices.",
        "The representation size grows linearly, not exponentially, for higher semantic types, allowing for simpler and more efficient parameter estima-tion, storage, and computation.",
        "As a consequence of our architecture, we no longer need to perform the complicated step-by-step estimation for elements of higher arity.",
        "In-deed, one can estimate each matrix of a complex representation individually using the simple method of Baroni and Zamparelli (2010).",
        "For in-stance, for transitive verbs we estimate the verb-subject combination matrix from subject and verb-93 boys ~ boys eat (intrans.)",
        "~ eat, 2 s eat boys eat 2 s eat?",
        "~ boys+ ~ eat meat ~ meat eat (trans.)",
        "~ eat, 2 s eat, 2 o eat boys eat meat 2 s eat?",
        "~ boys+ ~ eat+ 2 o eat?",
        "~ meat (is) eaten (pass.)",
        "~ eat, 2 o eat meat is eaten ~ eat+ 2 o eat?",
        "~ meat Table 4: The verb to eat associated to different sets of matrices in different syntactic contexts.",
        "subject vectors, the verb-object combination matrix from object and verb-object vectors.",
        "We expect a reasonably large corpus to feature many occurrences of a verb with a variety of subjects and a variety of objects (but not necessarily a variety of subjects with each of the objects as required by Grefenstette et al.'s training), allowing us to avoid the data sparseness issue.",
        "The semantic representations we propose include a semantic vector for constituents of any semantic type, thus enabling semantic comparison for words of different parts of speech (the case of demolition vs. demolish).",
        "Finally, the fact that we represent the predicate interaction with each of its arguments in a separate matrix allows for a natural and intuitive treatment of argument alternations.",
        "For instance, as shown in Table 4, one can distinguish the transitive and intransitive usages of the verb to eat by the presence of the object-oriented matrix of the verb while keeping the rest of the representation intact.",
        "To model passive usages, we insert the object matrix of the verb only, which will be multiplied by the syntactic subject vector, capturing the similarity between eat meat and meat is eaten.",
        "So keeping the verb's interaction with subject and object encoded in distinct matrices not only solves the issues of representation size for arbitrary semantic types, but also provides a sensible built-in strategy for handling a word's occurrence in multiple constructions.",
        "Indeed, if we encounter a verb used intransitively which was only attested as transitive in the training corpus, we can simply omit the object matrix to obtain a type-appropriate representation.",
        "On the other hand, if the verb occurs with more arguments than usual in testing materials, we can add a default diagonal identity matrix to its representation, signaling agnosticism about how the verb relates to the unexpected argument.",
        "This flexibility makes our model suitable to compute vector representations of sentences without stumbling at unseen syntactic usages of words.",
        "To summarize, plf is an extension of the lexical function model that inherits its strengths and overcomes its weaknesses.",
        "We still employ a linguistically-motivated notion of semantic composition as function application and use distinct kinds of representations for different semantic types.",
        "At the same time, we avoid high order tensor representations, produce semantic vectors for all syntactic constituents, and allow for an elegant and transparent correspondence between different syntactic usages of a lexeme, such as the transi-tive, the intransitive, and the passive usages of the verb to eat.",
        "Last but not least, our implementation is suitable for realistic language processing since it allows to produce vectors for sentences of arbitrary size, including those containing novel syntactic configurations.",
        "3 Evaluation 3.1 Evaluation materials We consider 5 different benchmarks that focus on different aspects of sentence-level semantic composition.",
        "The first data set, created by Edward Grefenstette and Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh and introduced in Kartsaklis et al. (2013), features 200 sentence pairs that were rated for similarity by 43 annotators.",
        "In this data set, sentences have fixed adjective-noun-verb-adjective-noun (anvan) structure, and they were built in order to crucially require context-based verb disambiguation (e.g., young woman filed long nails is paired with both young woman smoothed long nails and young woman registered long nails).",
        "We also consider a similar data set introduced by Grefenstette (2013), comprising 200 sentence pairs rated by 50 annotators.",
        "We will call these benchmarks anvan1 and anvan2, respectively.",
        "Evaluation is carried out by computing the Spearman correlation between the annotator similarity ratings for the sentence pairs and the cosines of the vectors produced by the various systems for the same sentence pairs.",
        "The benchmark introduced by The Pham et al. (2013) at the TFDS workshop (tfds below) was specifically designed to test compositional methods for their sensitivity to word order and the semantic effect of determiners.",
        "The tfds benchmark contains 157 target sentences that are matched with a set of (approximate) paraphrases (8 on av-94 erage), and a set of ?foils?",
        "(17 on average).",
        "The foils have high lexical overlap with the targets but very different meanings, due to different determiners and/or word order.",
        "For example, the target A man plays an acoustic guitar is matched with paraphrases such as A man plays guitar and The man plays the guitar, and foils such as The man plays no guitar and A guitar plays a man.",
        "A good system should return higher similarities for the comparison with the paraphrases with respect to that with the foils.",
        "Performance is assessed through the t-standardized cross-target average of the difference between mean cosine with paraphrases and mean cosine with foils (Pham and col-leagues, equivalently, reported non-standardized average and standard deviations).",
        "The two remaining data sets are larger and more ?natural?, as they were not constructed by linguists under controlled conditions to focus on specific phenomena.",
        "They are aimed at evaluating systems on the sort of free-form sentences one encounters in real-life applications.",
        "The msrvid data set from the SemEval-2012 Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task (Agirre et al., 2012) consists of 750 sentence pairs that describe brief videos.",
        "Sentence pairs were scored for similarity by 5 subjects each.",
        "Following standard practice in paraphrase detection studies (e.g., Blacoe and Lapata (2012)), we use cosine similarity between sentence pairs as computed by one of our systems together with two shallow similarity cues: word overlap between the two sentences and difference in sentence length.",
        "We obtain a final similarity score by weighted addition of the 3 cues, with the optimal weights determined by linear regression on separate msrvid train data that were also provided by the SemEval task organizers (before combining, we checked that the collinearity between cues was low).",
        "System scores are evaluated by their Pearson correlation with the human ratings.",
        "The final set we use is onwn, from the *SEM- 2013 STS shared task (Agirre et al., 2013).",
        "This set contains 561 pairs of glosses (from the Word-Net and OntoNotes databases), rated by 5 judges for similarity.",
        "Our main interest in this set stems from the fact that glosses are rarely well-formed full sentences (consider, e.g., cause something to pass or lead somewhere; coerce by violence, fill with terror).",
        "For this reason, they are very challenging for standard parsers.",
        "Indeed, we estimated from a sample of 40 onwn glosses that the C&C parser (see below) has only 45% accuracy on this set.",
        "Since plf needs syntactic information to construct sentence vectors compositionally, we test it on onwn to make sure that it is not overly sensitive to parser noise.",
        "Evaluation proceeds as with msrvid (cue weights are determined by 10-fold cross-validation).",

        "We did not attempt to train a lf model for the larger and more varied msrvid and onwn data sets, as this would have been extremely time consuming and impractical for all the reasons we discussed in Section 1.2 above.",
        "Training plf (practical lexical function) proceeds similarly, but we also build preposition matrices (from ?noun, preposition-noun?",
        "vector pairs), and for verbs we prepare separate subject and object matrices.",
        "Since syntax guides lf and plf composition, we supplied all test sentences with categorial grammar parses.",
        "Every sentence in the anvan1 and anvan2 datasets has the form (subject) Adjective + Noun + Transitive Verb + (object) Adjective + Noun, so parsing them is trivial.",
        "All sentences in tfds have a predictable structure that allows perfect parsing with simple finite state rules.",
        "In all these cases, applying a general-purpose parser to the data would have, at best, had no impact and, at worst, introduced parsing errors.",
        "For msrvid and onwn, we used the output of the C&C parser (Clark and Curran, 2007).",
        "3.3 Results Table 5 summarizes the performance of our models on the chosen tasks, and compares it to the state of the art reported in previous work, as well as to various strong baselines.",
        "The plf model performs very well on both anvan benchmarks, outperforming not only add and mult, but also the full-fledged lf model.",
        "Given that these data sets contain, systematically, transitive verbs, the major difference between plf and lf lies in their representation of the latter.",
        "Evidently, the separately-trained subject and object matrices of plf, being less affected by data sparseness than the 3-way tensors of lf, are better able to capture how verbs interact with their arguments.",
        "For an-van1, plf is just below the state of the art, which is based on disambiguating the verb vector in context (Kartsaklis and Sadrzadeh, 2013), and lf outperforms the baseline, which consists in using the verb vector only as a proxy to sentence similarity.",
        "5 On anvan2, plf outperforms the best model 5 We report state of the art from Kartsaklis and Sadrzadeh models anvan anvan tfds msr onwn 1 2 vid add 8 22 -0.2 78 66 mult 8 -4 -2.3 77 55 lf 15 30 5.90 NA NA plf 20 36 2.7 79 67 soa 22 27 11.4 87 75 baseline 8 22 7.9 77 55 Table 5: Performance of composition models on all evaluation sets.",
        "Figures of merit follow previous art on each set and are: percentage Spearman coefficients for anvan1 and anvan2, t-standardized average difference between mean cosines with paraphrases and with foils for tfds, percentage Pearson coefficients for msrvid and onwn.",
        "State-of-the-art (soa) references: anvan1: Kartsaklis and Sadrzadeh (2013); anvan2: Grefenstette (2013); tfds: The Pham et al. (2013); msrvid: B?ar et al. (2012); onwn: Han et al. (2013).",
        "Baselines: anvan1/anvan2: verb vectors only; tfds: word overlap; msrvid/onwn: word overlap + sentence length.",
        "reported by Grefenstette (2013) (an implementation of the lexical function ideas along the lines of Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh (2011a; 2011b)).",
        "And lf is, again, the only model, besides plf, that performs better than the baseline.",
        "In the tfds task, not surprisingly the add and mult models, lacking determiner representations and being order-insensitive, fail to distinguish between true paraphrases and foils (indeed, for the mult model foils are significantly closer to the targets than the paraphrases, probably because the latter have lower content word overlap than the foils, that often differ in word order and determiners only).",
        "Our plf approach is able to handle determiners and word order correctly, as demonstrated by a highly significant (p < 0.01) difference between paraphrase and foil similarity (average difference in cosine .017, standard deviation .077).",
        "In this case, however, the traditional lf model (aver- age difference .044, standard deviation .092) outperforms plf.",
        "Since determiners are handled identically under the two approaches, the culprit must be word order.",
        "We conjecture that the lf 3-way tensor representation of transitive verbs leads to a stronger asymmetry between sentences with in-(2013) rather than Kartsaklis et al. (2013), since only the former used a source corpus that is comparable to ours.",
        "96 verted arguments, and thus makes this model particularly sensitive to word order differences.",
        "In-deed, if we limit evaluation to those foils characterized by word order changes only, lf discriminates between paraphrases and foils even more clearly, whereas the plf difference, while still sig-nificant, decreases slightly.",
        "The state-of-the-art row for tfds reports the lf implementation by The Pham et al. (2013), which outperforms ours.",
        "The main difference is that Pham and colleagues do not normalize vectors like we do.",
        "If we don't normalize, we do get larger differences for our models as well, but consistently lower performance in all other tasks.",
        "More wor-ryingly, the simple word overlap baseline reported in the table sports a larger difference than our best model.",
        "Clearly, this baseline is exploiting the systematic determiner differences in the foils and, in-deed, when it is evaluated on foils where only word order changes its performance is no longer significant.",
        "On msrvid, the plf approach outperforms add and mult, although the difference between the three is not big.",
        "Our result stands in contrast with Blacoe and Lapata (2012), the only study we are aware of that compared a sophisticated composition model (Socher et al.'s 2011 model) to add and mult on realistic sentences, which attained the top performance with the simple models for both figures of merit they used.",
        "6 The best 2012 STS system (B?ar et al., 2012), obtained 0.87 correla-tion, but with many more and considerably more complex features than the ones we used here.",
        "In-deed, our simple system would have obtained a respectable 25/89 ranking in the STS 2012 msrvid task.",
        "Still, we must also stress the impressive performance of our baseline, given by the combination of the word overlap and sentence length cues.",
        "This suggests that the msrvid benchmark lacks the lexical and syntactic variety we would like to test our systems on.",
        "Our plf model is again the best on the onwn set (albeit by a small margin over add).",
        "This is a very positive result, in the light of the fact that the parser has very low performance on the onwn glosses, thus suggesting that plf can produce sensible semantic vectors from noisy syntac-6 We refer here to the results reported in the erratum available at http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.",
        "uk/s1066731/pdf/emnlp2012erratum.pdf.",
        "The add/mult advantage was even more marked in the original paper.",
        "tic representations.",
        "Here the overlap+length baseline does not perform so well, and again the best STS 2013 system (Han et al., 2013) uses considerably richer knowledge sources and algorithms than ours.",
        "Our plf-based method would have reached a respectable 20/90 rank in the STS 2013 onwn task.",
        "As a final remark, in all experiments the running time of plf was only slightly larger than for the simpler models, but orders of magnitude smaller than lf, confirming another practical side of our approach.",
        "4 Conclusion We introduced an approach to compositional distributional semantics based on a linguistically-motivated syntax-to-semantics type mapping, but simple and flexible enough that it can produce representations of English sentences of arbitrary size and structure.",
        "We showed that our approach is competitive against the more complex lexical function model when evaluated on the simple constructions the latter can be applied to, and it outperforms the additive and multiplicative compositionality models when tested on more realistic benchmarks (where the full-fledged lexical function approach is difficult or impossible to use), even in presence of strong noise in its syntactic input.",
        "While our results are encouraging, no current benchmark combines large-scale, real-life data with the syntactic variety on which a syntax-driven approach to semantics such as ours could truly prove its worth.",
        "The recently announced SemEval 2014 Task 1 7 is filling exactly this gap, and we look forward to apply our method to this new benchmark, as soon as it becomes available.",
        "One of the strengths of our framework is that it allows for incremental improvement focused on specific constructions.",
        "For example, one could add representations for different conjunctions (and vs. or), train matrices for verb arguments other than subject and direct object, or include new types of modifiers into the model, etc.",
        "While there is potential for local improvements, our framework, which extends and improves on existing compositional semantic vector models, has demonstrated its ability to account for full sentences in a principled and elegant way.",
        "Our implementation of the model relies on simple and effi-7 http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/ task1/ 97 cient training, works fast, and shows good empirical results.",
