        "Morphological segmentation is considered to be indispensable when translating between English and morphologically complex languages such as Arabic.",
        "Morphological complexity leads to much higher type to token ratios than English, which can create sparsity problems during translation model estimation.",
        "Morphological segmentation addresses this issue by splitting surface forms into meaningful morphemes, while also performing orthographic transformations to further reduce sparsity.",
        "For example, the Arabic noun ??Y??",
        "lldwl ?to the countries?",
        "is segmented as l+ ?to?",
        "Aldwl ?the countries?.",
        "When translating from Arabic, this segmentation process is performed as input preprocessing and is otherwise transparent to the translation system.",
        "However, when translating into Arabic, the decoder produces segmented out-put, which must be desegmented to produce readable text.",
        "For example, l+ Aldwl must be converted to lldwl.",
        "Desegmentation is typically performed as a post-processing step that is independent from the decoding process.",
        "While this division of labor is useful, the pipeline approach may prevent the desegmenter from recovering from errors made by the decoder.",
        "Despite the efforts of the decoder's various component models, the system may produce mismatching segments, such as s+ hzymp, which pairs the future particle s+ ?will?",
        "with a noun hzymp ?defeat?, instead of a verb.",
        "In this sce-nario, there is no right desegmentation; the post-processor has been dealt a losing hand.",
        "In this work, we show that it is possible to maintain the sparsity-reducing benefit of segmentation while translating directly into unsegmented text.",
        "We desegment a large set of possible decoder outputs by processing n-best lists or lat-tices, which allows us to consider both the segmented and desegmented output before locking in the decoder's decision.",
        "We demonstrate that significant improvements in translation quality can be achieved by training a linear model to re-rank this transformed translation space.",
        "2 Related Work Translating into morphologically complex languages is a challenging and interesting task that has received much recent attention.",
        "Most techniques approach the problem by transforming the target language in some manner before training the translation model.",
        "They differ in what transformations are performed and at what stage they are reversed.",
        "The transformation might take the form of a morphological analysis or a morphological segmentation.",
        "100 2.1 Morphological Analysis Many languages have access to morphological an-alyzers, which annotate surface forms with their lemmas and morphological features.",
        "Bojar (2007) incorporates such analyses into a factored model, to either include a language model over target morphological tags, or model the generation of morphological features.",
        "Other approaches train an SMT system to predict lemmas instead of surface forms, and then inflect the SMT output as a post-processing step (Minkov et al., 2007; Clifton and Sarkar, 2011; Fraser et al., 2012; El Kholy and Habash, 2012b).",
        "Alternatively, one can reparame-terize existing phrase tables as exponential mod-els, so that translation probabilities account for source context and morphological features (Jeong et al., 2010; Subotin, 2011).",
        "Of these approaches, ours is most similar to the translate-then-inflect ap-proach, except we translate and then desegment.",
        "In particular, Toutanova et al. (2008) inflect and re-rank n-best lists in a similar manner to how we desegment and re-rank n-best lists or lattices.",
        "2.2 Morphological Segmentation Instead of producing an abstract feature layer, morphological segmentation transforms the target sentence by segmenting relevant morphemes, which are then handled as regular tokens during alignment and translation.",
        "This is done to reduce sparsity and to improve correspondence with the source language (usually English).",
        "Such a segmentation can be produced as a byproduct of analysis (Oflazer and Durgar El-Kahlout, 2007; Badr et al., 2008; El Kholy and Habash, 2012a), or may be produced using an unsupervised morphological segmenter such as Morfessor (Luong et al., 2010; Clifton and Sarkar, 2011).",
        "Work on target language morphological segmentation for SMT can be divided into three subproblems: segmentation, desegmentation and integration.",
        "Our work is concerned primarily with the integration problem, but we will discuss each subproblem in turn.",
        "The usefulness of a target segmentation depends on its correspondence to the source language.",
        "If a morphological feature does not manifest itself as a separate token in the source, then it may be best to leave its corresponding segment attached to the stem.",
        "A number of studies have looked into what granularity of segmentation is best suited for a particular language pair (Oflazer and Durgar El-Kahlout, 2007; Badr et al., 2008; Clifton and Sarkar, 2011; El Kholy and Habash, 2012a).",
        "Since our focus here is on integrating segmentation into the decoding process, we simply adopt the segmentation strategies recommended by previous work: the Penn Arabic Treebank scheme for English-Arabic (El Kholy and Habash, 2012a), and an unsupervised scheme for English-Finnish (Clifton and Sarkar, 2011).",
        "Desegmentation is the process of converting segmented words into their original surface form.",
        "For many segmentations, especially unsupervised ones, this amounts to simple concatenation.",
        "How-ever, more complex segmentations, such as the Arabic tokenization provided by MADA (Habash et al., 2009), require further orthographic adjustments to reverse normalizations performed during segmentation.",
        "Badr et al. (2008) present two Arabic desegmentation schemes: table-based and rule-based.",
        "El Kholy and Habash (2012a) provide an extensive study on the influence of segmentation and desegmentation on English-to-Arabic SMT.",
        "They introduce an additional desegmentation technique that augments the table-based approach with an unsegmented language model.",
        "Salameh et al. (2013) replace rule-based desegmentation with a discriminatively-trained character transducer.",
        "In this work, we adopt the Table+Rules approach of El Kholy and Habash (2012a) for English-Arabic, while concatenation is sufficient for English-Finnish.",
        "Work on integration attempts to improve SMT performance for morphologically complex target languages by going beyond simple pre- and post-processing.",
        "Oflazer and Durgar El-Kahlout (2007) desegment 1000-best lists for English-to-Turkish translation to enable scoring with an unsegmented language model.",
        "Unlike our work, they replace the segmented language model with the unsegmented one, allowing them to tune the linear model parameters by hand.",
        "We use both segmented and unsegmented language models, and tune automatically to optimize BLEU.",
        "Like us, Luong et al. (2010) tune on unsegmented references, 1 and translate with both segmented and unsegmented language models for English-to-Finnish translation.",
        "However, they adopt a scheme of word-boundary-aware 1 Tuning on unsegmented references does not require substantial modifications to the standard SMT pipeline.",
        "For ex-ample, Badr et al. (2008) also tune on unsegmented references by simply desegmenting SMT output before MERT collects sufficient statistics for BLEU.",
        "101 morpheme-level phrase extraction, meaning that target phrases include only complete words, though those words are segmented into morphemes.",
        "This enables full decoder integration, where we do n-best and lattice re-ranking.",
        "But it also comes at a substantial cost: when target phrases include only complete words, the system can only generate word forms that were seen during training.",
        "In this setting, the sparsity reduction from segmentation helps word alignment and target language modeling, but it does not result in a more expressive translation model.",
        "Further-more, it becomes substantially more difficult to have non-adjacent source tokens contribute morphemes to a single target word.",
        "For example, when translating ?with his blue car?",
        "into the Arabic ZA \u0010 P?",
        "Q?",
        "@ ?",
        "\u0010 KPAJ ?",

        "bsyArth AlzrqA?, the target word bsyArth is composed of three tokens: b+ ?with?, syArp ?car?",
        "and +h ?his?.",
        "With word-boundary-aware phrase extraction, a phrase pair containing all of ?with his blue car?",
        "must have been seen in the parallel data to translate the phrase correctly at test time.",
        "With lattice desegmentation, we need only to have seen AlzrqA?",
        "?blue?",
        "and the three morphological pieces of bsyArth for the decoder and desegmenter to assemble the phrase.",
        "3 Methods Our goal in this work is to benefit from the sparsity-reducing properties of morphological segmentation while simultaneously allowing the system to reason about the final surface forms of the target language.",
        "We approach this problem by augmenting an SMT system built over target segments with features that reflect the desegmented target words.",
        "In this section, we describe our various strategies for desegmenting the SMT system's output space, along with the features that we add to take advantage of this desegmented view.",
        "3.1 Baselines The two obvious baseline approaches each decode using one view of the target language.",
        "The unsegmented approach translates without segmenting the target.",
        "This trivially allows for an unsegmented language model and never makes desegmentation errors.",
        "However, it suffers from data sparsity and poor token-to-token correspondence with the source language.",
        "The one-best desegmentation approach segments the target language at training time and then desegments the one-best output in post-processing.",
        "This resolves the sparsity issue, but does not allow the decoder to take into account features of the desegmented target.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, we are the first group to go beyond one-best desegmentation for English-to-Arabic translation.",
        "In English-to-Finnish, although alternative integration strategies have seen some success (Luong et al., 2010), the current state-of-the-art performs one-best-desegmentation (Clifton and Sarkar, 2011).",
        "3.2 n-best Desegmentation The one-best approach can be extended easily by desegmenting n-best lists of segmented decoder output.",
        "Doing so enables the inclusion of an unsegmented target language model, and with a small amount of bookkeeping, it also allows the inclusion of features related to the operations performed during desegmentation (see Section 3.4).",
        "With new features reflecting the desegmented out-put, we can re-tune our enhanced linear model on a development set.",
        "Following previous work, we will desegment 1000-best lists (Oflazer and Durgar El-Kahlout, 2007).",
        "Once n-best lists have been desegmented, we can tune on unsegmented references as a side-benefit.",
        "This could improve translation quality, as it brings our training scenario closer to our test scenario (test BLEU is always measured on unsegmented references).",
        "In particular, it could address issues with translation length mismatch.",
        "Previous work that has tuned on unsegmented references has reported mixed results (Badr et al., 2008; Luong et al., 2010).",
        "3.3 Lattice Desegmentation An n-best list reflects a tiny portion of a decoder's search space, typically fixed at 1000 hypotheses.",
        "Lattices 2 can represent an exponential number of hypotheses in a compact structure.",
        "In this section, we discuss how a lattice from a multi-stack phrase-based decoder such as Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) can be desegmented to enable word-level features.",
        "Finite State Analogy A phrase-based decoder produces its output from left to right, with each operation appending the translation of a source phrase to a growing target hypothesis.",

        "The search graph of a phrase-based decoder can be interpreted as a lattice, which can be interpreted as a finite state acceptor over target strings.",
        "In its most natural form, such an acceptor emits target phrases on each edge, but it can easily be transformed into a form with one edge per token, as shown in Figure 1a.",
        "This is sometimes referred to as a word graph (Ueffing et al., 2002), although in our case the segmented phrase table also produces tokens that correspond to morphemes.",
        "Our goal is to desegment the decoder's output lattice, and in doing so, gain access to a compact, desegmented view of a large portion of the translation search space.",
        "This can be accomplished by composing the lattice with a desegmenting transducer that consumes morphemes and outputs desegmented words.",
        "This transducer must be able to consume every word in our lattice's output vocabulary.",
        "We define a word using the following regular expression: [prefix]* [stem] [suffix]* | [prefix]+ [suffix]+ (1) where [prefix], [stem] and [suffix] are non-overlapping sets of morphemes, whose members are easily determined using the segmenter's segment boundary markers.",

        "lh -- for him?, segmented as l+ ?for?",
        "+h ?him?.",
        "Equation 1 may need to be modified for other languages or segmentation schemes, but our techniques generalize to any definition that can be written as a regular expression.",
        "A desegmenting transducer can be constructed by first encoding our desegmenter as a table that maps morpheme sequences to words.",
        "Regardless of whether the original desegmenter was based on concatenation, rules or table-lookup, it can be encoded as a lattice-specific table by applying it to an enumeration of all words found in the lattice.",
        "We can then transform that table into a finite state transducer with one path per table entry.",
        "Finally, we take the closure of this trans-ducer, so that the resulting machine can transduce any sequence of words.",
        "The desegmenting trans-3 Throughout this paper, we use ?+?",
        "to mark morphemes as prefixes or suffixes, as in w+ or +h.",
        "In Equation 1 only, we overload ?+?",
        "as the Kleene cross: X+ == XX?.",
        "103 ducer for our running example is shown in Figure 1b.",
        "Note that tokens requiring no desegmentation simply emit themselves.",
        "The lattice (Fig- ure 1a) can then be desegmented by composing it with the transducer (1b), producing a desegmented lattice (1c).",
        "This is a natural place to introduce features that describe the desegmentation process, such as scores provided by a desegmentation table, which can be incorporated into the desegmenting transducer's edge weights.",
        "We now have a desegmented lattice, but it has not been annotated with an unsegmented (word- level) language model.",
        "In order to annotate lattice edges with an n-gram LM, every path coming into a node must end with the same sequence of (n?1) tokens.",
        "If this property does not hold, then nodes must be split until it does.",
        "4 This property is maintained by the decoder's recombination rules for the segmented LM, but it is not guaranteed for the desegmented LM.",
        "Indeed, the expanded word-level context is one of the main benefits of incorporating a word-level LM.",
        "Fortunately, LM annotation as well as any necessary lattice modifications can be performed simultaneously by composing the desegmented lattice with a finite state acceptor encoding the LM (Roark et al., 2011).",
        "In summary, we are given a segmented lattice, which encodes the decoder's translation space as an acceptor over morphemes.",
        "We compose this acceptor with a desegmenting transducer, and then with an unsegmented LM acceptor, producing a fully annotated, desegmented lattice.",
        "Instead of using a tool kit such as OpenFst (Allauzen et al., 2007), we implement both the desegmenting transducer and the LM acceptor programmatically.",
        "This eliminates the need to construct intermediate machines, such as the lattice-specific desegmenter in Figure 1b, and facilitates working with edges annotated with feature vectors as opposed to single weights.",
        "Programmatic Desegmentation Lattice desegmentation is a non-local lattice transformation.",
        "That is, the morphemes forming a word might span several edges, making desegmentation non-trivial.",
        "Luong et al. (2010) address this problem by forcing the decoder's phrase table to respect word boundaries, guaranteeing that each de-segmentable token sequence is local to an edge.",
        "4 Or the LM composition can be done dynamically, effectively decoding the lattice with a beam or cube-pruned search (Huang and Chiang, 2007).",
        "Inspired by the use of non-local features in forest decoding (Huang, 2008), we present an algorithm to find chains of edges that correspond to deseg-mentable token sequences, allowing lattice desegmentation with no phrase-table restrictions.",
        "This algorithm can be seen as implicitly constructing a customized desegmenting transducer and composing it with the input lattice on the fly.",
        "Before describing the algorithm, we define some notation.",
        "An input morpheme lattice is a triple ?n s ,N , E?, where N is a set of nodes, E is a set of edges, and n s ?",
        "N is the start node that begins each path through the lattice.",
