        "Due to the powerful capacity of feature learning and representation, Deep (multi-layer) Neural Networks (DNN) have achieved a great success in speech and image processing (Kavukcuoglu et al., 2010; Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Dahl et al., 2012).",
        "Recently, statistical machine translation (SMT) community has seen a strong interest in adapting and applying DNN to many tasks, such as word alignment (Yang et al., 2013), translation confidence estimation (Mikolov et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2013; Zou et al., 2013), phrase reordering prediction (Li et al., 2013), translation modelling (Auli et al., 2013; Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013) and language modelling (Duh et al., 2013; Vaswani et al., 2013).",
        "Most of these works attempt to improve some components in SMT based on word embedding, which converts a word into a dense, low dimensional, real-valued vector representation (Bengio et al., 2003; Bengio et al., 2006; Collobert and Weston, 2008; Mikolov et al., 2013).",
        "However, in the conventional (phrase-based) SMT, phrases are the basic translation units.",
        "The models using word embeddings as the direct inputs to DNN cannot make full use of the whole syntactic and semantic information of the phrasal translation rules.",
        "Therefore, in order to successfully apply DNN to model the whole translation process, such as modelling the decoding process, learning compact vector representations for the basic phrasal translation units is the essential and fundamental work.",
        "In this paper, we explore the phrase embedding, which represents a phrase (sequence of words) with a real-valued vector.",
        "In some previous works, phrase embedding has been discussed from different views.",
        "Socher et al. (2011) make the phrase embeddings capture the sentiment information.",
        "Socher et al. (2013a) enable the phrase embeddings to mainly capture the syntactic knowledge.",
        "Li et al. (2013) attempt to encode the reordering pattern in the phrase embeddings.",
        "Kalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013) utilize a simple convolution model to generate phrase embeddings from word embeddings.",
        "Mikolov et al. (2013) consider a phrase as an indivisible n-gram.",
        "Obviously, these methods of learning phrase embeddings either focus on some aspects of the phrase (e.g. reordering pattern), or impose strong assumptions (e.g. bag-of-words or indivisible n-gram).",
        "Therefore, these phrase embeddings are not suitable to fully represent the phrasal translation units in SMT due to the lack of semantic meanings of the phrase.",
        "Instead, we focus on learning phrase embeddings from the view of semantic meaning, so that our phrase embedding can fully represent the phrase and best fit the phrase-based SMT.",
        "Assuming the phrase is a meaningful composition 111 of its internal words, we propose Bilingually-constrained Recursive Auto-encoders (BRAE) to learn semantic phrase embeddings.",
        "The core idea behind is that a phrase and its correct translation should share the same semantic meaning.",
        "Thus, they can supervise each other to learn their semantic phrase embeddings.",
        "Similarly, non-translation pairs should have different semantic meanings, and this information can also be used to guide learning semantic phrase embeddings.",
        "In our method, the standard recursive auto-encoder (RAE) pre-trains the phrase embedding with an unsupervised algorithm by minimizing the reconstruction error (Socher et al., 2010), while the bilingually-constrained model learns to fine-tune the phrase embedding by minimizing the semantic distance between translation equivalents and maximizing the semantic distance between non-translation pairs.",
        "We use an example to explain our model.",
        "As illustrated in Fig. 1, the Chinese phrase on the left and the English phrase on the right are translations with each other.",
        "If we learn the embedding of the Chinese phrase correctly, we can regard it as the gold representation for the English phrase and use it to guide the process of learning English phrase embedding.",
        "In the other direction, the Chinese phrase embedding can be learned in the same way.",
        "This procedure can be performed with an co-training style algorithm so as to minimize the semantic distance between the translation equivalents 1 .",
        "In this way, the result Chinese and English phrase embeddings will capture the semantics as much as possible.",
        "Furthermore, a transformation function between the Chinese and English semantic spaces can be learned as well.",
        "With the learned model, we can accurately measure the semantic similarity between a source phrase and a translation candidate.",
        "Accordingly, we evaluate the BRAE model on two end-to-end SMT tasks (phrase table pruning and decoding with phrasal semantic similarities) which need to check whether a translation candidate and the source phrase are in the same meaning.",
        "In phrase table pruning, we discard the phrasal translation rules with low semantic similarity.",
        "In decoding with phrasal semantic similarities, we apply the semantic similarities of the phrase pairs as new features during decoding to guide translation can-1 For simplicity, we do not show non-translation pairs here.",

        "The experiments show that up to 72% of the phrase table can be discarded without significant decrease on the translation quality, and in decoding with phrasal semantic similarities up to 1.7 BLEU score improvement over the state-of-the-art baseline can be achieved.",
        "In addition, our semantic phrase embeddings have many other potential applications.",
        "For in-stance, the semantic phrase embeddings can be directly fed to DNN to model the decoding process.",
        "Besides SMT, the semantic phrase embeddings can be used in other cross-lingual tasks (e.g. cross-lingual question answering) and monolingual applications such as textual entailment, question answering and paraphrase detection.",
        "2 Related Work Recently, phrase embedding has drawn more and more attention.",
        "There are three main perspectives handling this task in monolingual languages.",
        "One method considers the phrases as bag-of-words and employs a convolution model to transform the word embeddings to phrase embeddings (Collobert et al., 2011; Kalchbrenner and Blun-som, 2013).",
        "Gao et al. (2013) also use bag-of-words but learn BLEU sensitive phrase embeddings.",
        "This kind of approaches does not take the word order into account and loses much information.",
        "Instead, our bilingually-constrained recursive auto-encoders not only learn the composition mechanism of generating phrases from words, but also fine tune the word embeddings during the model training stage, so that we can induce the full information of the phrases and internal words.",
        "Another method (Mikolov et al., 2013) deals with the phrases having a meaning that is not a simple composition of the meanings of its individual words, such as New York Times.",
        "They first find the phrases of this kind.",
        "Then, they regard these phrases as indivisible units, and learn their embeddings with the context information.",
        "How-112 ever, this kind of phrase embedding is hard to capture full semantics since the context of a phrase is limited.",
        "Furthermore, this method can only account for a very small part of phrases, since most of the phrases are compositional.",
        "In contrast, our method attempts to learn the semantic vector representation for any phrase.",
        "The third method views any phrase as the meaningful composition of its internal words.",
        "The recursive auto-encoder is typically adopted to learn the way of composition (Socher et al., 2010; Socher et al., 2011; Socher et al., 2013a; Socher et al., 2013b; Li et al., 2013).",
        "They pre-train the RAE with an unsupervised algorithm.",
        "And then, they fine-tune the RAE according to the label of the phrase, such as the syntactic category in parsing (Socher et al., 2013a), the polarity in sentiment analysis (Socher et al., 2011; Socher et al., 2013b), and the reordering pattern in SMT (Li et al., 2013).",
        "This kind of semi-supervised phrase embedding is in fact performing phrase clustering with respect to the phrase label.",
        "For example, in the RAE-based phrase reordering model for SMT (Li et al., 2013), the phrases with the similar reordering tendency (e.g. monotone or swap) are close to each other in the embedding space, such as the prepositional phrases.",
        "Obviously, this kind methods of semi-supervised phrase embedding do not fully address the semantic meaning of the phrases.",
        "Although we also follow the composition-based phrase embedding, we are the first to focus on the semantic meanings of the phrases and propose a bilingually-constrained model to induce the semantic information and learn transformation of the semantic space in one language to the other.",
        "3 Bilingually-constrained Recursive Auto-encoders This section introduces the Bilingually-constrained Recursive Auto-encoders (BRAE), that is inspired by two observations.",
        "First, the recursive auto-encoder provides a reasonable composition mechanism to embed each phrase.",
        "And the semi-supervised phrase embedding (Socher et al., 2011; Socher et al., 2013a; Li et al., 2013) further indicates that phrase embedding can be tuned with respect to the label.",
        "Second, even though we have no correct semantic phrase representation as the gold label, the phrases sharing the same meaning provide an indirect but feasible way.",
