        "Making translation decisions is a difficult task in many Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems.",
        "Current translation modeling approaches usually use context dependent information to disambiguate translation candidates.",
        "For exam-ple, translation sense disambiguation approaches (Carpuat and Wu, 2005; Carpuat and Wu, 2007) are proposed for phrase-based SMT systems.",
        "Meanwhile, for hierarchical phrase-based or syntax-based SMT systems, there is also much work involving rich contexts to guide rule selection (He et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2008; Marton and Resnik, 2008; Xiong et al., 2009).",
        "Although these methods are effective and proven successful in many SMT systems, they only leverage within-?",
        "This work was done while the first and fourth authors were visiting Microsoft Research.",
        "sentence contexts which are insufficient in exploring broader information.",
        "For example, the word driver often means ?the operator of a motor ve-hicle?",
        "in common texts.",
        "But in the sentence ?Fi- nally, we write the user response to the buffer, i.e., pass it to our driver?, we understand that driver means ?computer program?.",
        "In this case, people understand the meaning because of the IT topical context which goes beyond sentence-level analysis and requires more relevant knowledge.",
        "There-fore, it is important to leverage topic information to learn smarter translation models and achieve better translation performance.",
        "Topic modeling is a useful mechanism for discovering and characterizing various semantic concepts embedded in a collection of documents.",
        "Attempts on topic-based translation modeling include topic-specific lexicon translation models (Zhao and Xing, 2006; Zhao and Xing, 2007), topic similarity models for synchronous rules (Xiao et al., 2012), and document-level translation with topic coherence (Xiong and Zhang, 2013).",
        "In addition, topic-based approaches have been used in domain adaptation for SMT (Tam et al., 2007; Su et al., 2012), where they view different topics as different domains.",
        "One typical property of these approaches in common is that they only utilize parallel data where document boundaries are explicitly given.",
        "In this way, the topic of a sentence can be inferred with document-level information using off-the-shelf topic modeling toolkits such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) or Hidden Topic Markov Model (HTMM) (Gruber et al., 2007).",
        "Most of them also assume that the input must be in document level.",
        "However, this situation does not always happen since there is considerable amount of parallel data which does not have document boundaries.",
        "In addition, contemporary SMT systems often works on sentence level rather than document level due to the efficiency.",
        "Although we can easily apply LDA at the 133 sentence level, it is quite difficult to infer the topic accurately with only a few words in the sentence.",
        "This makes previous approaches inefficient when applied them in real-world commercial SMT systems.",
        "Therefore, we need to devise a systematical approach to enriching the sentence and inferring its topic more accurately.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to learning topic representations for sentences.",
        "Since the information within the sentence is insufficient for topic modeling, we first enrich sentence contexts via Information Retrieval (IR) methods using content words in the sentence as queries, so that topic-related monolingual documents can be collected.",
        "These topic-related documents are utilized to learn a specific topic representation for each sentence using a neural network based approach.",
        "Neural network is an effective technique for learning different levels of data representations.",
        "The levels inferred from neural network correspond to distinct levels of concepts, where high-level representations are obtained from low-level bag-of-words input.",
        "It is able to detect correlations among any subset of input features through non-linear transformations, which demonstrates the superiority of eliminating the effect of noisy words which are irrelevant to the topic.",
        "Our problem fits well into the neural network framework and we expect that it can further improve inferring the topic representations for sentences.",
        "To incorporate topic representations as translation knowledge into SMT, our neural network based approach directly optimizes similarities between the source language and target language in a compact topic space.",
        "This underlying topic space is learned from sentence-level parallel data in order to share topic information across the source and target languages as much as possible.",
        "Addi-tionally, our model can be discriminatively trained with a large number of training instances, without expensive sampling methods such as in LDA or HTMM, thus it is more practicable and scalable.",
        "Finally, we associate the learned representation to each bilingual translation rule.",
        "Topic-related rules are selected according to distributional similarity with the source text, which helps hypotheses generation in SMT decoding.",
        "We integrate topic similarity features in the log-linear model and evaluate the performance on the NIST Chinese-to-English translation task.",
        "Experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly improves translation accuracy over a state-of-the-art baseline.",
        "2 Background: Deep Learning Deep learning is an active topic in recent years which has triumphed in many machine learning research areas.",
        "This technique began raising public awareness in the mid-2000s after researchers showed how a multi-layer feed-forward neural network can be effectively trained.",
        "The training procedure often involves two phases: a layer-wise unsupervised pre-training phase and a supervised fine-tuning phase.",
        "For pre-training, Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) (Hinton et al., 2006), auto-encoding (Bengio et al., 2006) and sparse coding (Lee et al., 2006) are most frequently used.",
        "Unsupervised pre-training trains the network one layer at a time and helps guide the parameters of the layer towards better regions in parameter space (Bengio, 2009).",
        "Followed by fine-tuning in this parameter region, deep learning is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in various research areas, including breakthrough results on the ImageNet dataset for objective recognition (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), significant error reduction in speech recognition (Dahl et al., 2012), etc.",
        "Deep learning has also been successfully applied in a variety of NLP tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recog-nition, semantic role labeling (Collobert et al., 2011), parsing (Socher et al., 2011a), sentiment analysis (Socher et al., 2011b), etc.",
        "Most NLP research converts a high-dimensional and sparse binary representation into a low-dimensional and real-valued representation.",
        "This low-dimensional representation is usually learned from huge amount of monolingual texts in the pre-training phase, and then fine-tuned towards task-specific criterion.",
        "Inspired by previous successful re-search, we first learn sentence representations using topic-related monolingual texts in the pre-training phase, and then optimize the bilingual similarity by leveraging sentence-level parallel data in the fine-tuning phase.",
        "3 Topic Similarity Model with Neural Network In this section, we explain our neural network based topic similarity model in detail, as well as how to incorporate the topic similarity features into SMT decoding procedure.",

        "The most relevant N documents d f and d e are retrieved and converted to a high-dimensional, bag-of-words input f and e for the representation learning 1 .",
        "There are two phases in our neural network training process: pre-training and fine-tuning.",
        "In the pre-training phase (Section 3.1), we build two neural networks with the same structure but different parameters to learn a low-dimensional representation for sentences in two different languages.",
        "Then, in the fine-tuning phase (Section 3.2), our model directly optimizes the similarity of two low-dimensional representations, so that it highly correlates to SMT decoding.",
        "Finally, the learned representation is used to calculate similarities which are integrated as features in SMT decoding procedure (Section 3.3).",
        "3.1 Pre-training using denoising auto-encoder In the pre-training phase, we leverage neural network structures to transform high-dimensional sparse vectors to low-dimensional dense vectors.",
        "The topic similarity is calculated on top of the learned dense vectors.",

        "Assuming that the input is a n-of-V binary vector x representing the bag-of-words (V is the vocabulary size), an auto-encoder consists of an encoding process g(x) and a decoding process h(g(x)).",

        "Our goal is to learn a low-dimensional vector which can preserve information from the original n-of-V vector.",
        "One problem with auto-encoder is that it treats all words in the same way, making no distinguish-ment between function words and content words.",
        "The representation learned by auto-encoders tends to be influenced by the function words, thereby it is not robust.",
        "To alleviate this problem, Vincent et al. (2008) proposed the Denoising Auto-Encoder (DAE), which aims to reconstruct a clean, ?re- paired?",
