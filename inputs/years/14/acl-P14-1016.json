        "While many users do not explicitly list all their personal information in their online profile, their user generated content often contains strong evidence to suggest many types of user attributes, for example education, spouse, and employment (See Table 1).",

        "One contribution of the work presented here is the creation of the first large-scale dataset on three general Twitter user profile domains (i.e., EDUCA-TION, JOB, SPOUSE).",
        "Experiments demonstrate that by simultaneously harnessing both text features and network information, our approach is able to make accurate user profile predictions.",
        "We are optimistic that our approach can easily be applied to further user attributes such as HOBBIES and INTERESTS (MOVIES, BOOKS, SPORTS or STARS), RELIGION, HOMETOWN, LIVING LOCA-TION, FAMILY MEMBERS and so on, where training data can be obtained by matching ground truth retrieved from multiple types of online social media such as Facebook, Google Plus, or LinkedIn.",

        "2 Related Work While user profile inference from social media has received considerable attention (Al Zamal et al., 2012; Rao and Yarowsky, 2010; Rao et al., 2010; Rao et al., 2011), most previous work has treated this as a classification task where the goal is to predict unary predicates describing attributes of the user.",
        "Examples include gender (Ciot et al., 2013; Liu and Ruths, 2013; Liu et al., 2012), age (Rao et al., 2010), or political polarity (Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011; Conover et al., 2011).",
        "A significant challenge that has limited previous efforts in this area is the lack of available training data.",
        "For example, researchers obtain training data by employing workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk to manually identify users?",
        "gender from profile pictures (Ciot et al., 2013).",
        "This approach is appropriate for attributes such as gender with a small numbers of possible values (e.g., male or fe-male), for which the values can be directly identified.",
        "However for attributes such as spouse or education there are many possible values, making it impossible to manually search for gold standard answers within a large number of tweets which may or may not contain sufficient evidence.",
        "Also related is the Twitter user timeline extraction algorithm of Li and Cardie (2013).",
        "This work is not focused on user attribute extraction, however.",
        "Distant Supervision Distant supervision, also known as weak supervision, is a method for learning to extract relations from text using ground truth from an existing database as a source of supervision.",
        "Rather than relying on mention-level annotations, which are expensive and time consuming to generate, distant supervision lever-ages readily available structured data sources as a weak source of supervision for relation extraction from related text corpora (Craven et al., 1999).",
        "For example, suppose r(e 1 , e 2 ) = IsIn(Paris, France) is a ground tuple in the database and s =?Paris is the capital of France?",
        "contains synonyms for both ?Paris?",
        "and ?France?, then we assume that s may express the fact r(e 1 , e 2 ) in some way and can be used as positive training examples.",
        "In addition to the wide use in text entity relation extraction (Mintz et al., 2009; Ritter et al., 2013; Hoffmann et al., 2011; Surdeanu et al., 2012; Takamatsu et al., 2012), distant supervision has been applied to multiple 166 Figure 1: Illustration of Goolge Plus ?knowledge base?.",

        "In the user attribute extraction literature, researchers have considered neighborhood context to boost inference accuracy (Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011; Al Zamal et al., 2012), where information about the degree of their connectivity to their pre-labeled users is included in the feature vectors.",
        "A related algorithm by Mislove et al. (2010) crawled Facebook profiles of 4,000 Rice University students and alumni and inferred attributes such as major and year of matriculation purely based on network information.",

        "6 Then, we fetched tweets containing the mention of the education/job entity from each correspondent user's twitter stream using Twitter's search API 7 (shown in Figure 2) and used them to construct positive bags of tweets expressing the associated attribute, namely EDUCATION(User i , Entity j ), or EMPLOYER(User i , Entity j ).",

        "Positive/negative training tweets are obtained in the same way as was previously described for EDUCATION and JOB.",

        "It is interesting to note that Education exhibits a much stronger HOMOPHILY property than 14 https://code.google.com/p/ ark-tweet-nlp/downloads/list 170 Job.",
        "Such affinity demonstrates that our approach that tries to take advantage of network information for attribute prediction of holds promise.",
        "5.3 Evaluation and Discussion We evaluate settings described in Section 4.2 i.e., GLOBAL setting, where user-level attribute is predicted directly from jointly feature space and LOCAL setting where user-level prediction is made based on tweet-level prediction along with different inference approaches described in Section 4.4, i.e. NEIGH-OBSERVED and NEIGH-LATENT, regarding whether neighbor information is observed or latent.",

        "NELL: For Job and Education, candidate is selected as attribute value once it matches bag of words in the list of universities or companies borrowed from NELL.",
        "For Education, the list is extended by alias identification based on Freebase.",
        "For Job, we also fetch the name abbreviations 15 .",
        "NELL is only implemented for Education and Job attribute.",
        "For each setting from each approach, we report the (P)recision, (R)ecall and (F)1-score.",
        "For LOCAL setting, we report the performance for both entity-level prediction (Entity) and posting-level prediction (Tweet).",
        "Results for Education, Job and Spouse from different approaches appear in Table 4, 5 and 6 respectively.",
        "Local or Global For horizontal comparison, we observe that GLOBAL obtains a higher Precision score but a lower Recall than LOCAL(ENTITY).",
        "This can be explained by the fact that LOCAL(U) sets z k i,e = 1 once one posting x ?",
        "L e i is identified as attribute related, while GLOBAL tend to be more meticulous by considering the conjunctive feature space from all postings.",
        "Homophile effect In agreement with our ex-pectation, NEIGH-OBSERVED performs better than NEIGH-LATENT since erroneous predictions in 15 http://www.abbreviations.com/ NEIGH-LATENT setting will have negative influence on further prediction during the greedy search process.",
        "Both NEIGH-OBSERVED and NEIGH-LATENT where network information is harnessed, perform better than Only-Text, which the prediction is made independently on user's text features.",
        "The improvement of NEIGH-OBSERVED over Only-Text is 22.7% and 6.4% regarding F1 score for Education and Job respectively, which further illustrate the usefulness of making use of Homophile effect for attribute inference on online social media.",
        "It is also interesting to note the improvement much more significant in Education inference than Job inference.",
        "This is in accord with what we find in Section 5.2, where education network exhibits stronger HOMOPHILE property than Job network, enabling a significant benefit for education inference, but limited for job inference.",
        "Spouse prediction also benefits from neighboring effect and the improvement is about 12% for LOCAL(ENTITY) setting.",
        "Unlike Education and Job prediction, for which in NEIGH-OBSERVED setting all neighboring variables are observed, network variables are hidden during spouse prediction.",
        "By considering network information, the model benefits from evident clues offered by tweet corpus of user e's spouse when making prediction for e, but also suffers when erroneous decision are made and then used for downstream predictions.",
        "NELL Baseline Notably, NELL achieves highest Recall score for Education inference.",
        "It is also worth noting that most of education mentions that NELL fails to retrieve are those involve irregular spellings, such as HarvardUniv and Cornell U, which means Recall score for NELL baseline would be even higher if these irregular spellings are recognized in a more sophisticated system.",
        "The reason for such high recall is that as our ground truths are obtained from Google plus, the users from which are mostly affiliated with decent schools found in NELL dictionary.",
        "However, the high recall from NELL is sacrificed at preci-sion, as users can mention school entities in many of situations, such as paying a visit or reporting some relevant news.",
        "NELL will erroneously classify these cases as attribute mentions.",
        "NELL does not work out for Job, with a fairly poor 0.0156 F1 score for LOCAL(ENTITY) and 0.163 for LOCAL(TWEET).",
