        "How does one make a message ?successful??",
        "This question is of interest to many entities, including political parties trying to frame an issue (Chong and Druckman, 2007), and individuals attempting to make a point in a group meeting.",
        "In the first case, an important type of success is achieved if the national conversation adopts the rhetoric of the party; in the latter case, if other group members repeat the originating individual's point.",
        "The massive availability of online messages, such as posts to social media, now affords researchers new means to investigate at a very large scale the factors affecting message propagation, also known as adoption, sharing, spread, or vi-rality.",
        "According to prior research, important features include characteristics of the originating author (e.g., verified Twitter user or not, author's messages?",
        "past success rate), the author's social network (e.g., number of followers), message tim-ing, and message content or topic (Artzi et al., 2012; Bakshy et al., 2011; Borghol et al., 2012; Guerini et al., 2011; Guerini et al., 2012; Hansen et al., 2011; Hong et al., 2011; Lakkaraju et al., 2013; Milkman and Berger, 2012; Ma et al., 2012; Petrovi?c et al., 2011; Romero et al., 2013; Suh et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2013; Tsur and Rappoport, 2012).",

        "[link to photo]?.",
        "Our interest in this paper is the effect of alternative message wording, meaning how the message is said, rather than what the message is about.",
        "In contrast to the identity/social/timing/topic features mentioned above, wording is one of the few factors directly under an author's control when he or she seeks to convey a fixed piece of content.",
        "For example, consider a speaker at the ACL business meeting who has been tasked with proposing that Paris be the next ACL location.",
        "This person cannot on the spot become ACL president, change the shape of his/her social network, wait until the next morning to speak, or campaign for Rome instead; but he/she can craft the message to be more hu-morous, more informative, emphasize certain aspects instead of others, and so on.",
        "In other words, we investigate whether a different choice of words affects message propagation, controlling for user and topic: would user BarackObama have gotten significantly more (or fewer) retweets if he had used some alternate wording to announce his re-election?",

        "Specifically, it turns out to be unexpectedly common for the same user to post different tweets regarding the same URL ?",

        "within a relatively short period of time.",
        "3 Some example pairs are shown in Table 1; we see that the paired tweets may differ dramatically, going far beyond word-for-word substitutions, so that quite interesting changes can be studied.",
        "Looking at these examples, can one in fact tell from the wording which tweet in a topic- and author-controlled pair will be more successful?",
        "The answer may not be a priori clear.",
        "For example, for the first pair in the table, one person we asked found t 1 's invocation of a ?scandal?",
        "to be more attention-grabbing; but another person preferred t 2 because it is more informative about the URL's content and includes ?fight media portrayal?.",
        "In an Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) experiment (?4), we found that humans achieved an average accuracy of 61.3%: not that high, but better than chance, indicating that it is somewhat possible for humans to predict greater message spread from different deliveries of the same information.",

        "2 Although hashtags have been used as coarse-grained topic labels in prior work, for our purposes, we have no assurance that two tweets both using, say, ?#Tahrir?",
        "would be attempting to express the same message but in different words.",
        "In contrast, see the same-URL examples in Table 1.",
        "3 Moreover, Twitter presents tweets to a reader in strict chronological order, so that there are no algorithmic-ranking effects to compensate for in determining whether readers saw a tweet.",
        "And, Twitter accumulates retweet counts for the entire retweet cascade and displays them for the original tweet at the root of the propagation tree, so we can directly use Twitter's retweet counts to compare the entire reach of the different versions.",

        "Our classifier fared significantly better than a number of baselines, including a strong classifier trained on the most- and least-retweeted tweets that was even granted access to author and timing metadata.",
        "2 Related work The idea of using carefully controlled experiments to study effective communication strategies dates back at least to Hovland et al. (1953).",
        "Recent studies range from examining what characteristics of New York Times articles correlate with high re-sharing rates (Milkman and Berger, 2012) to looking at how differences in description affect the spread of content-controlled videos or images (Borghol et al., 2012; Lakkaraju et al., 2013).",
        "Simmons et al. (2011) examined the variation of quotes from different sources to examine how textual memes mutate as people pass them along, but did not control for author.",

        "To our knowledge, there have been no large-scale studies exploring wording effects in a both topic- and author-controlled setting.",

        "However, if we evaluate the accuracy of the majority response among the 39 judgments per pair, the number rises to 73%.",
