        "Existing models for social media personal analytics assume access to thousands of messages per user, even though most users author content only sporadically over time.",
        "Given this sparsity, we: (i) leverage content from the local neighborhood of a user; (ii) evaluate batch models as a function of size and the amount of messages in various types of neighbor-hoods; and (iii) estimate the amount of time and tweets required for a dynamic model to predict user preferences.",
        "We show that even when limited or no self-authored data is available, language from friend, retweet and user mention communications provide sufficient evidence for prediction.",
        "When updating models over time based on Twitter, we find that political preference can be often be predicted using roughly 100 tweets, depending on the context of user selection, where this could mean hours, or weeks, based on the author's tweeting frequency."

        "Inferring latent user attributes such as gender, age, and political preferences (Rao et al., 2011; Zamal et al., 2012; Cohen and Ruths, 2013) automatically from personal communications and social media including emails, blog posts or public discussions has become increasingly popular with the web getting more social and volume of data available.",
        "Resources like Twitter 1 or Facebook 2 become extremely valuable for studying the underlying properties of such informal communications because of its volume, dynamic nature, and diverse population (Lunden, 2012; Smith, 2013).",
        "1 http://www.demographicspro.com/ 2 http://www.wolframalpha.com/facebook/ The existing batch models for predicting latent user attributes rely on thousands of tweets per author (Rao et al., 2010; Conover et al., 2011; Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011a; Burger et al., 2011; Zamal et al., 2012; Nguyen et al., 2013).",
        "However, most Twitter users are less prolific than those examined in these works, and thus do not produce the thousands of tweets required to obtain their levels of accuracy e.g., the median number of tweets produced by a random Twitter user per day is 10.",
        "Moreover, recent changes to Twitter API querying rates further restrict the speed of access to this resource, effectively reducing the amount of data that can be collected in a given time period.",
        "In this paper we analyze and go beyond static models formulating personal analytics in social media as a streaming task.",
        "We first evaluate batch models that are cognizant of low-resource prediction setting described above, maximizing the efficiency of content in calculating personal analytics.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that makes explicit the tradeoff between accuracy and cost (manifest as calls to the Twitter API), and optimizes to a different tradeoff than state-of-the-art approaches, seeking maximal performance when limited data is available.",
        "In addition, we propose streaming models for personal analytics that dynamically update user labels based on their stream of communications which has been addressed previously by Van Durme (2012b).",
        "Such models better capture the real-time nature of evidence being used in latent author attribute predictions tasks.",

        "Querying for more neighbors per user is more beneficial than querying for extra content from the existing neighbors e.g., 5 tweets from 10 neighbors leads to higher accuracy than 25 tweets from 2 neighbors or 50 tweets from 1 neighbor.",
        "This may be also the effect of data heterogeneity in social media compared to e.g., political debate text (Thomas et al., 2006).",

        "We think that friend relationships are more effective than e.g., follower relationships because it is very likely that users share common interests and preferences with their friends, e.g. Facebook friends can even be used to predict a user's credit score.",
        "13 User mentions and retweets are two primary ways of interaction on Twitter.",
        "They both allow to share information e.g., political news, events with others and to be involved in direct communication e.g., live political discussions, political groups.",
