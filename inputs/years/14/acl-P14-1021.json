        "Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG; Steedman (2000)) is able to derive typed dependency structures (Hockenmaier, 2003; Clark and Curran, 2007), providing a useful approximation to the underlying predicate-argument relations of ?who did what to whom?.",
        "To date, CCG remains the most competitive formalism for recovering ?deep?",
        "dependencies arising from many linguistic phenomena such as raising, control, extraction and coordination (Rimell et al., 2009; Nivre et al., 2010).",
        "To achieve its expressiveness, CCG exhibits so-called ?spurious?",
        "ambiguity, permitting many non-standard surface derivations which ease the recovery of certain dependencies, especially those arising from type-raising and composition.",
        "But this raises the question of what is the most suitable model for CCG: should we model the deriva-tions, the dependencies, or both?",
        "The choice for some existing parsers (Hockenmaier, 2003; Clark and Curran, 2007) is to model derivations directly, restricting the gold-standard to be the normal-form derivations (Eisner, 1996) from CCGBank (Hock- enmaier and Steedman, 2007).",
        "Modelling dependencies, as a proxy for the semantic interpretation, fits well with the theory of CCG, in which Steedman (2000) argues that the derivation is merely a ?trace?",
        "of the underlying syntactic process, and that the structure which is built, and predicated over when applying constraints on grammaticality, is the semantic interpretation.",
        "The early dependency model of Clark et al. (2002), in which model features were defined over only dependency structures, was partly motivated by these theoretical observations.",
        "More generally, dependency models are desirable for a number of reasons.",
        "First, modelling dependencies provides an elegant solution to the spurious ambiguity problem (Clark and Curran, 2007).",
        "Second, obtaining training data for dependencies is likely to be easier than for syntactic derivations, especially for incomplete data (Schneider et al., 2013).",
        "Clark and Curran (2006) show how the dependency model from Clark and Curran (2007) extends naturally to the partial-training case, and also how to obtain dependency data cheaply from gold-standard lexical category sequences alone.",
        "And third, it has been argued that dependencies are an ideal representation for parser evaluation, especially for CCG (Briscoe and Car-roll, 2006; Clark and Hockenmaier, 2002), and so optimizing for dependency recovery makes sense from an evaluation perspective.",
        "In this paper, we fill a gap in the literature by developing the first dependency model for a shift-reduce CCG parser.",
        "Shift-reduce parsing applies naturally to CCG (Zhang and Clark, 2011), and the left-to-right, incremental nature of the decoding fits with CCG's cognitive claims.",
        "The discriminative model is global and trained with the structured perceptron.",
        "The decoder is based on beam-search 218 (Zhang and Clark, 2008) with the advantage of linear-time decoding (Goldberg et al., 2013).",
        "A main contribution of the paper is a novel technique for training the parser using a dependency oracle, in which all derivations are hidden.",
        "A challenge arises from the potentially exponential number of derivations leading to a gold-standard dependency structure, which the oracle needs to keep track of.",
        "Our solution is an integration of a packed parse forest, which efficiently stores all the derivations, with the beam-search decoder at training time.",
        "The derivations are not explicitly part of the data, since the forest is built from the gold-standard dependencies.",
        "We also show how perceptron learning with beam-search (Collins and Roark, 2004) can be extended to handle the additional ambiguity, by adapting the ?violation- fixing?",
        "perceptron of Huang et al. (2012).",
        "Results on the standard CCGBank tests show that our parser achieves absolute labeled F-score gains of up to 0.5 over the shift-reduce parser of Zhang and Clark (2011); and up to 1.05 and 0.64 over the normal-form and hybrid models of Clark and Curran (2007), respectively.",
        "2 Shift-Reduce with Beam-Search This section describes how shift-reduce techniques can be applied to CCG, following Zhang and Clark (2011).",
        "First we describe the deterministic process which a parser would follow when tracing out a single, correct derivation; then we describe how a model of normal-form derivations ?",
        "or, more accurately, a sequence of shift-reduce actions leading to a normal-form derivation ?",
        "can be used with beam-search to develop a non-deterministic parser which selects the highest scoring sequence of actions.",
        "Note this section only describes a normal-form derivation model for shift-reduce parsing.",
        "Section 3 explains how we extend the approach to dependency models.",
        "The shift-reduce algorithm adapted to CCG is similar to that of shift-reduce dependency parsing (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre and Mc-Donald, 2008; Zhang and Clark, 2008; Huang and Sagae, 2010).",
        "Following Zhang and Clark (2011), we define each item in the parser as a pair ?s, q?, where q is a queue of remaining input, consisting of words and a set of possible lexical categories for each word (with q 0 being the front word), and s is the stack that holds subtrees s 0 , s 1 , ... (with s 0 at the top).",
        "Subtrees on the stack are partial deriva-step stack (s n , ..., s 1 , s 0 ) queue (q 0 , q 1 , ..., q m ) action 0 Mr. President visited Paris 1 N/N President visited Paris SHIFT 2 N/N N visited Paris SHIFT 3 N visited Paris REDUCE 4 NP visited Paris UNARY 5 NP (S [dcl]\\NP)/NP Paris SHIFT 6 NP (S [dcl]\\NP)/NP N SHIFT 7 NP (S [dcl]\\NP)/NP NP UNARY 8 NP S [dcl]\\NP REDUCE 9 S [dcl] REDUCE Figure 1: Deterministic example of shift-reduce CCG parsing (lexical categories omitted on queue).",
        "tions that have been built as part of the shift-reduce process.",
        "SHIFT, REDUCE and UNARY are the three types of actions that can be applied to an item.",
        "A SHIFT action shifts one of the lexical categories of q 0 onto the stack.",
        "A REDUCE action combines s 0 and s 1 according to a CCG combinatory rule, producing a new category on the top of the stack.",
        "A UNARY action applies either a type-raising or type-changing rule to the stack-top category s 0 .",
        "1 Figure 1 shows a deterministic example for the sentence Mr. President visited Paris, giving a single sequence of shift-reduce actions which produces a correct derivation (i.e. one producing the correct set of dependencies).",
        "Starting with the initial item ?s, q?",
        "0 (row 0), which has an empty stack and a full queue, a total of nine actions are applied to produce the complete derivation.",
        "Applying beam-search to a statistical shift-reduce parser is a straightforward extension to the deterministic example.",
        "At each step, a beam is used to store the top-k highest-scoring items, resulting from expanding all items in the previous beam.",
        "An item becomes a candidate output once it has an empty queue, and the parser keeps track of the highest scored candidate output and returns the best one as the final output.",
        "Compared with greedy local-search (Nivre and Scholz, 2004), the use of a beam allows the parser to explore a larger search space and delay difficult ambiguity-resolving decisions by considering multiple items in parallel.",
        "We refer to the shift-reduce model of Zhang and Clark (2011) as the normal-form model, where the oracle for each sentence specifies a unique sequence of gold-standard actions which produces the corresponding normal-form derivation.",
        "No dependency structures are involved at training and test time, except for evaluation.",
        "In the next sec-tion, we describe a dependency oracle which considers all sequences of actions producing a gold-standard dependency structure to be correct.",
        "1 See Hockenmaier (2003) and Clark and Curran (2007) for a description of CCG rules.",

        "TC denotes type-changing.",
        "3 The Dependency Model Categories in CCG are either basic (such as NP and PP ) or complex (such as (S [dcl ]\\NP)/NP ).",
        "Each complex category in the lexicon defines one or more predicate-argument relations, which can be realized as a predicate-argument dependency when the corresponding argument slot is consumed.",
        "For example, the transitive verb category above defines two relations: one for the subject NP and one for the object NP .",
        "In this paper a CCG predicate-argument dependency is a 4-tuple: ?h f , f, s, h a ?",
        "where h f is the lexical item of the lexical category expressing the relation; f is the lexical category; s is the argument slot; and h a is the head word of the argument.",
        "Since the lexical items in a dependency are indexed by their sentence positions, all dependencies for a sentence form a set, which is referred to as a CCG dependency structure.",
        "Clark and Curran (2007) contains a detailed description of dependency structures.",
        "Fig. 2 shows an example demonstrating spurious ambiguity in relation to a CCG dependency structure.",
        "In both derivations, the first two lexical categories are combined using forward application (>) and the following dependency is realized: ?Mr.,N /N 1 , 1,President?.",
        "In the normal-form derivation (a), the dependency ?visited, (S\\NP 1 )/NP 2 , 2,Paris?",
        "is created by combining the transitive verb category with the object NP using forward application.",
        "One final de-pendency, ?visited, (S\\NP 1 )/NP 2 , 1,President?, is realized when the root node S [dcl ] is produced through backward application (<).",
        "Fig. 2(b) shows a non-normal-form derivation which uses type-raising (T) and composition (B) (which are not required to derive the correct dependency structure).",
        "In this alternative derivation, the dependency ?visited, (S\\NP 1 )/NP 2 , 1,President?",
        "is realized using forward composition (B), and ?visited, (S\\NP 1 )/NP 2 , 2,Paris?",
        "is realized when the S [dcl ] root is produced.",
        "The chart-based dependency model of Clark and Curran (2007) treats all derivations as hid-den, and defines a probabilistic model for a dependency structure by summing probabilities of all derivations leading to a particular structure.",
        "Features are defined over both derivations and CCG predicate-argument dependencies.",
        "We follow a similar approach, but rather than define a probabilistic model (which requires summing), we define a linear model over sequences of shift-reduce actions, as for the normal-form shift-reduce model.",
        "However, the difference compared to the normal-form model is that we do not assume a single gold-standard sequence of actions.",
        "Similar to Goldberg and Nivre (2012), we define an oracle which determines, for a gold-standard dependency structure, G, what the valid transition sequences are (i.e. those sequences corresponding to derivations leading to G).",
        "More specifically, the oracle can determine, givenG and an item ?s, q?, what the valid actions are for that item (i.e. what actions can potentially lead to G, starting with ?s, q?",
        "and the dependencies already built on s).",
        "However, there can be exponentially many valid action sequences for G, which we represent efficiently using a packed parse forest.",
        "We show how the forest can be used, during beam-search decoding, to determine the valid actions for a parse item (Section 3.2).",
        "We also show, in Section 3.3, how perceptron training with early-update (Collins and Roark, 2004) can be used in this setting.",
