        "R |D| is a binary vector which is zero in all positions except at k-th index.",
        "The Lookup Table layer can be seen as a simple projection layer where the character embedding for each context 294 character is achieved by table lookup operation according to their indices.",
        "The embedding matrix M is initialized with small random numbers and trained by back-propagation.",
        "We will analyze in more detail about the effect of character embeddings in Section 4.",
        "2.2 Tag Scoring The most common tagging approach is the window approach.",
        "The window approach assumes that the tag of a character largely depends on its neighboring characters.",

        "We use this tag set in our method.",

        "Compared with Mansur et al. (2013), their model is a global one where the training and inference is performed at sentence-level.",
        "Workable as these methods seem, one of the limitations of them is that the tag-tag interaction and the neural network are modeled seperately.",
        "The simple tag-tag transition neglects the impact of context characters and thus limits the ability to capture flexible interactions between tags and context characters.",
        "Moreover, the simple non-linear transformation in equation (2) is also poor to model the complex interactional effects in Chinese word segmentation.",
        "3 Max-Margin Tensor Neural Network 3.1 Tag Embedding To better model the tag-tag interaction given the context characters, distributed representation for tags instead of traditional discrete symbolic representation is used in our model.",

        "The concatenation operation in Layer 1 then concatenates the character embeddings and tag embedding together into a long vector a.",
        "In this way, the tag representation can be directly incorporated in the neural network so that the tag-tag interaction and tag-character interaction can be explicitly modeled in deeper layers (See Section 3.2).",
        "More-over, the transition score in equation (4) is not necessary in our model, because, by incorporating tag embedding into the neural network, the effect of tag-tag interaction and tag-character interaction are covered uniformly in one same model.",
        "Now 1 We also tried the architecture in which the tag embedding of current tag is also considered, but this did not bring much improvement and runs slower Figure 3: The tensor-based transformation in Layer 2. a is the input from Layer 1.",

        "It can be represented as a multi-dimensional array of numerical values.",
        "An advantage of the tensor is that it can explicitly model multiple interactions in data.",
        "As a result, tensor-based model have been widely used in a variety of tasks (Salakhutdinov et al., 2007; Krizhevsky et al., 2010; Socher et al., 2013b).",
        "In Chinese word segmentation, a proper modeling of the tag-tag interaction, tag-character interaction and character-character interaction is very important.",
        "In linear models, these kinds of interactions are usually modeled as features.",
        "In conventional neural network models, however, the input embeddings only implicitly interact through the non-linear function which can hardly model the complexity of the interactions.",
        "Given the advantage of tensors, we apply a tensor-based transformation to the input vector.",

        "As we can see, in each tensor slice i, the embeddings are explicitly related in a bilinear form which captures the interactions between characters and tags.",
        "The multiplicative operations between tag embeddings and character embeddings can somehow be seen as ?feature combination?, which are hand-designed in feature-based models.",
        "Our model learns the information automatically and encodes them in tensor parameters and embeddings.",
        "Intuitively, we can interpret each slice of the tensor as capturing a specific type of tag-character interaction and character-character interaction.",
        "Combining the tensor product with linear trans-formation, the tensor-based transformation in Layer 2 is defined as: h = g(a T V [1:H 2 ] a+W 1 a+ b 1 ) (8) where W 1 ?",

        "3.3 Tensor Factorization Despite tensor-based transformation being effective for capturing the interactions, introducing tensor-based transformation into neural network models to solve sequence labeling task is time prohibitive since the tensor product operation drastically slows down the model.",
        "Without considering matrix optimization algorithms, the complexity of the non-linear transformation in equation (2) 2 The bias term is omitted in Figure 3 for simplicity Figure 4: Tensor product with tensor factorization is O(H 1 H 2 ) while the tensor operation complexity in equation (8) is O(H 2 1 H 2 ).",
        "The tensor-based transformation is H 1 times slower.",
        "Moreover, the additional tensor could bring millions of parameters to the model which makes the model suffer from the risk of overfitting.",
        "To remedy this, we propose a tensor factorization approach that factorizes each tensor slice as the product of two low-rank matrices.",

        "First, vector a is projected into two r-dimension vectors f 1 and f 2 .",

        "The complexity of the tensor operation is now O(rH 1 H 2 ).",
        "As long as r is small enough, the factorized tensor operation would be much faster than the un-factorized one and the number of free parameters would also be much smaller, which prevent the model from overfitting.",

        "We also compare our model with the CRF model (Lafferty et al., 2001), which is a widely used log-linear model for Chinese word segmentation.",

        "Our study is consistent with this line of research, however, our model explicitly models the interactions between tags and context characters and accordingly captures more semantic information.",
        "Tensor-based transformation was also used in other neural network models for its ability to capture multiple interactions in data.",
        "For example, Socher et al. (2013b) exploited tensor-based function in the task of Sentiment Analysis to capture more semantic information from constituents.",
        "However, given the small size of their tensor ma-trix, they do not have the problem of high time cost and overfitting problem as we faced in modeling a sequence labeling task like Chinese word segmentation.",
        "That's why we propose to decrease computational cost and avoid overfitting with tensor factorization.",

        "Our tensor factorization is related to these work but uses a different tensor factorization approach.",
        "By introducing tensor factorization into the neural network model for sequence labeling tasks, the model training and inference are speeded up and overfitting is prevented.",
