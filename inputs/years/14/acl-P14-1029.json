        "Negation is often expressed through the use of negative signals or negators?words like isn't and never, and it can significantly affect the sentiment of its scope.",
        "Understanding the impact of negation on sentiment is essential in automatic analysis of sentiment.",
        "The literature contains interesting research attempting to model and understand the behavior (reviewed in Section 2).",
        "For example, Figure 1: Effect of a list of common negators in modifying sentiment values in Stanford Sentiment Treebank.",
        "The x-axis is s(~w), and y-axis is s(w n , ~w).",
        "Each dot in the figure corresponds to a text span being modified by (composed with) a negator in the treebank.",
        "The red diagonal line corresponds to the sentiment-reversing hypothesis that simply reverses the sign of sentiment values.",
        "a simple yet influential hypothesis posits that a negator reverses the sign of the sentiment value of the modified text (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2004; Kennedy and Inkpen, 2006).",
        "The shifting hypothesis (Taboada et al., 2011), however, assumes that negators change sentiment values by a constant amount.",
        "In this paper, we refer to a negation word as the negator (e.g., isn't), a text span being modified by and composed with a negator as the argument (e.g., very good), and entire phrase (e.g., isn't very good) as the negated phrase.",
        "The recently available Stanford Sentiment Treebank (Socher et al., 2013) renders manually anno-tated, real-valued sentiment scores for all phrases in parse trees.",
        "This corpus provides us with the data to further understand the quantitative behavior of negators, as the effect of negators can now be studied with arguments of rich syntactic and semantic variety.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the effect of a common list of negators on sentiment as observed 304 on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank.1 Each dot in the figure corresponds to a negated phrase in the treebank.",
        "The x-axis is the sentiment score of its argument s(~w) and y-axis the sentiment score of the entire negated phrase s(w n , ~w).",
        "We can see that the reversing assumption (the red diagonal line) does capture some regularity of human perception, but rather roughly.",
        "Moreover, the figure shows that same or similar s(~w) scores (x-axis) can correspond to very different s(w n , ~w) scores (y-axis), which, to some degree, suggests the potentially complicated behavior of negators.2 This paper describes a quantitative study of the effect of a list of frequent negators on sentiment.",

        "1 The sentiment values have been linearly rescaled from the original range [0, 1] to [-0.5, 0.5]; in the figure a negative or positive value corresponds to a negative or a positive sentiment respectively; zero means neutral.",
        "The negator list will be discussed later in the paper.",

        "In written text, sentiment is conveyed with word senses and their composition, and in speech also via prosody such as pitch (Mairesse et al., 2012).",
        "Early work on automatic sentiment analysis includes the widely cited work of (Hatzivas- siloglou and McKeown, 1997; Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002), among others.",
        "Since then, there has been an explosion of research addressing various aspects of the problem, including detecting sub-jectivity, rating and classifying sentiment, label-ing sentiment-related semantic roles (e.g., target of sentiment), and visualizing sentiment (see surveys by Pang and Lee (2008) and Liu and Zhang (2012)).",
        "Negation modeling Negation is a general grammatical category pertaining to the changing of the truth values of propositions; negation modeling is not limited to sentiment.",
        "For example, paraphrase and contradiction detection systems rely on detecting negated expressions and opposites (Harabagiu et al., 2006).",
        "In general, a negated expression and the opposite of the expression may or may not convey the same meaning.",
        "For example, not alive has the same meaning as dead, however, not tall does not always mean short.",
        "Some automatic methods to detect opposites were proposed by Hatzivas-siloglou and McKeown (1997) and Mohammad et al. (2013).",
        "Negation modeling for sentiment An early yet influential reversing assumption conjectures that a negator reverses the sign of the sentiment value of the modified text (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2004; Kennedy and Inkpen, 2006), e.g., from +0.5 to - 0.5, or vice versa.",
        "A different hypothesis, called the shifting hypothesis in this paper, assumes that negators change the sentiment values by a constant amount (Taboada et al., 2011; Liu and Sen-eff, 2009).",
        "Other approaches to negation modeling have been discussed in (Jia et al., 2009; Wiegand et al., 2010; Lapponi et al., 2012; Benamara et al., 2012).",
        "In the process of semantic composition, the effect of negators could depend on the syntax and semantics of the text spans they modify.",
        "The approaches of modeling this include bag-of-word-based models.",
        "For example, in the work of (Kennedy and Inkpen, 2006), a feature not good will be created if the word good is encountered 305 within a predefined range after a negator.",
        "There exist different ways of incorporating more complicated syntactic and semantic information.",
        "Much recent work considers sentiment analysis from a semantic-composition perspective (Moilanen and Pulman, 2007; Choi and Cardie, 2008; Socher et al., 2012; Socher et al., 2013), which achieved the state-of-the-art performance.",
        "Moilanen and Pulman (2007) used a collection of hand-written compositional rules to assign sentiment values to different granularities of text spans.",
        "Choi and Cardie (2008) proposed a learning-based framework.",
        "The more recent work of (Socher et al., 2012; Socher et al., 2013) proposed models based on recursive neural networks that do not rely on any heuristic rules.",
        "Such models work in a bottom-up fashion over the parse tree of a sentence to infer the sentiment label of the sentence as a composition of the sentiment expressed by its constituting parts.",
        "The approach leverages a principled method, the forward and backward propagation, to learn a vector representation to optimize the system performance.",
        "In principle neural network is able to fit very complicated functions (Mitchell, 1997), and in this paper, we adapt the state-of-the-art approach described in (Socher et al., 2013) to help understand the behavior of negators specifically.",
        "3 Negation models based on heuristics We begin with previously proposed methods that leverage heuristics to model the behavior of negators.",
        "We then propose to extend them to consider lexical information of the negators themselves.",
        "3.1 Non-lexicalized assumptions and modeling In previous research, some influential, widely adopted assumptions posit the effect of negators to be independent of both the specific negators and the semantics and syntax of the arguments.",
        "In this paper, we call a model based on such assumptions a non-lexicalized model.",
        "In general, we can simply define this category of models in Equation 1.",
        "That is, the model parameters are only based on the sentiment value of the arguments.",
        "s(w n , ~w) def = f(s(~w)) (1) 3.1.1 Reversing hypothesis A typical model falling into this category is the reversing hypothesis discussed in Section 2, where a negator simply reverses the sentiment score s(~w) to be ?s(~w); i.e., f(s(~w)) = ?s(~w).",
        "3.1.2 Shifting hypothesis Basic shifting Similarly, a shifting based model depends on s(~w) only, which can be written as: f(s(~w)) = s(~w) ?",
        "sign(s(~w)) ?",
        "C (2) where sign(.)",
        "is the standard sign function which determines if the constant C should be added to or deducted from s(w n ): the constant is added to a negative s(~w) but deducted from a positive one.",
        "Polarity-based shifting As will be shown in our experiments, negators can have different shifting power when modifying a positive or a negative phrase.",
        "Thus, we explore the use of two different constants for these two situations, i.e., f(s(~w)) = s(~w)?sign(s(~w))?C(sign(s(~w))).",
        "The constant C now can take one of two possible values.",
        "We will show that this simple modification improves the fitting performance statistically significantly.",
        "Note also that instead of determining these constants by human intuition, we use the training data to find the constants in all shifting-based models as well as for the parameters in other models.",
        "3.2 Simple lexicalized assumptions The above negation hypotheses rely on s(~w).",
        "As intuitively shown in Figure 1, the capability of the non-lexicalized heuristics might be limited.",
        "Further semantic or syntactic information from either the negators or the phrases they modify could be helpful.",
        "The most straightforward way of expanding the non-lexicalized heuristics is probably to make the models to be dependent on the negators.",
        "s(w n , ~w) def = f(w n , s(~w)) (3) Negator-based shifting We can simply extend the basic shifting model above to consider the lexical information of negators: f(s(~w)) = s(~w) ?",
        "sign(s(~w)) ?C(w n ).",
        "That is, each negator has its own C .",
        "We call this model negator-based shifting.",
        "We will show that this model also statistically significantly outperforms the basic shifting without overfitting, although the number of parameters have increased.",
        "306 Combined shifting We further combine the negator-based shifting and polarity-based shifting above: f(s(~w)) = s(~w) ?",
        "sign(s(~w)) ?",
        "C(w n , sign(s(~w))).",
        "This shifting model is based on negators and the polarity of the text they modify: constants can be different for each negator-polarity pair.",
        "The number of parameters in this model is the multiplication of number of negators by two (the number of sentiment polarities).",
        "This model further improves the fitting performance on the test data.",
        "4 Semantics-enriched modeling Negators can interact with arguments in complex ways.",
        "Figure 1 shows the distribution of the effect of negators on sentiment without considering further semantics of the arguments.",
        "The question then is that whether and how much incorporating further syntax and semantic information can help better fit or predict the negation effect.",
        "Above, we have considered the semantics of the negators.",
        "Be-low, we further make the models to be dependent on the arguments.",
        "This can be written as: s(w n , ~w) def = f(w n , s(~w), r(~w)) (4) In the formula, r(~w) is a certain type of representation for the argument ~w and it models the semantics or/and syntax of the argument.",
        "There exist different ways of implementing r(~w).",
        "We consider two models in this study: one drops s(~w) in Equation 4 and directly models f(w n , r(~w)).",
        "That is, the non-uniform information shown in Figure 1 is not directly modeled.",
        "The other takes into account s(~w) too.",
        "For the former, we adopt the recursive neural tensor network (RNTN) proposed recently by Socher et al. (2013), which has showed to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in sentiment analysis.",
        "For the latter, we propose a prior sentiment-enriched tensor network (PSTN) to take into account the prior sentiment of the argument s(~w).",
        "4.1 RNTN: Recursive neural tensor network A recursive neural tensor network (RNTN) is a specific form of feed-forward neural network based on syntactic (phrasal-structure) parse tree to conduct compositional sentiment analysis.",
        "For completeness, we briefly review it here.",
        "More details can be found in (Socher et al., 2013).",
        "As shown in the black portion of Figure 2, each instance of RNTN corresponds to a binary parse Figure 2: Prior sentiment-enriched tensor network (PSTN) model for sentiment analysis.",
        "tree of a given sentence.",
        "Each node of the parse tree is a fixed-length vector that encodes compositional semantics and syntax, which can be used to predict the sentiment of this node.",
        "The vector of a node, say p 2 in Figure 2, is computed from the d-dimensional vectors of its two children, namely a and p 1 (a, p 1 ?",

        "A major difference of RNTN from the conventional recursive neural network (RRN) (Socher et al., 2012) is the use of the tensor V in order to directly capture the multiplicative interaction of two input vectors, although the matrix W implicitly captures the nonlinear interaction between the input vectors.",
        "The training of RNTN uses conventional forward-backward propagation.",
        "4.2 PSTN: Prior sentiment-enriched tensor network The non-uniform distribution in Figure 1 has showed certain correlations between the sentiment values of s(w n , ~w) and s(~w), and such information has been leveraged in the models discussed in Section 3.",
        "We intend to devise a model that implements Equation 4.",
        "It bridges between the models we have discussed above that use either s(~w) or r(~w).",
        "We extend RNTN to directly consider the sentiment information of arguments.",
        "Consider the node p 2 in Figure 2.",
        "When calculating its vector, we aim to directly engage the sentiment information of its right child, i.e., the argument.",
        "To this end, we make use of the sentiment class information of 307 p1 , noted as psen 1 .",
        "As a result, the vector of p 2 is calculated as follows: p 2 = tanh( [ a p 1 ] T V [1:d] [ a p 1 ] + W [ a p 1 ] (6) + [ a p sen 1 ] T V sen [1:d] [ a p sen 1 ] + W sen [ a p sen 1 ] ) As shown in Equation 6, for the node vector p 1 ?",

        "R m?1), and the negator a.",
        "Here, we assume the sentiment task has m classes.",
        "Following the idea of Wilson et al. (2005), we regard the sentiment of p 1 as a prior sentiment as it has not been affected by the specific context (negators), so we denote our method as prior sentiment-enriched tensor network (PSTN).",
        "In Figure 2, the red portion shows the added components of PSTN.",
        "Note that depending on different purposes, psen 1 can take the value of the automatically predicted sentiment distribution obtained in forward propa-gation, the gold sentiment annotation of node p 1 , or even other normalized prior sentiment value or confidence score from external sources (e.g., sentiment lexicons or external training data).",
        "This is actually an interesting place to extend the current recursive neural network to consider extrinsic knowledge.",
        "However, in our current study, we focus on exploring the behavior of negators.",
        "As we have discussed above, we will use the human annotated sentiment for the arguments, same as in the models discussed in Section 3.",

        "Note that the gradient calculations for the V,W,W label, L are the same as that of presented in (Socher et al., 2013).",
        "In the backpropogation process of the training, each node (except the root node) in the tree carries two kinds of errors: the local softmax error and the error passing down from its parent node.",
