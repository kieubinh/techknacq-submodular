        "In opinion mining, extracting opinion targets and opinion words are two fundamental subtasks.",
        "Opinion targets are objects about which users?",
        "opinions are expressed, and opinion words are words which indicate opinions?",
        "polarities.",
        "Extracting them can provide essential information for obtaining fine-grained analysis on customers?",
        "opinions.",
        "Thus, it has attracted a lot of attentions (Hu and Liu, 2004b; Liu et al., 2012; Moghaddam and Ester, 2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012).",
        "To this end, previous work usually employed a collective extraction strategy (Qiu et al., 2009; Hu and Liu, 2004b; Liu et al., 2013b).",
        "Their intuition is: opinion words usually co-occur with opinion targets in sentences, and there are strong modification relationship between them (called opinion relation in (Liu et al., 2012)).",
        "If a word is an opinion word, other words with which that word having opinion relations will have highly probability to be opinion targets, and vice versa.",
        "In this way, extraction is alternatively performed and mutual reinforced between opinion targets and opinion words.",
        "Although this strategy has been widely employed by previous approaches, it still has several limitations.",
        "1) Only considering opinion relations is insufficient.",
        "Previous methods mainly focused on employing opinion relations among words for opinion target/word co-extraction.",
        "They have investigated a series of techniques to enhance opinion relations identification performance, such as nearest neighbor rules (Liu et al., 2005), syntactic patterns (Zhang et al., 2010; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005), word alignment models (Liu et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013b; Liu et al., 2013a), etc.",
        "How-ever, we are curious that whether merely employing opinion relations among words is enough for opinion target/word extraction?",
        "We note that there are additional types of relations among words.",
        "For example, ?LCD?",
        "and ?LED?",
        "both denote the same aspect ?screen?",
        "in TV set domain, and they are topical related.",
        "We call such relations between homogeneous words as semantic relations.",
        "If we have known ?LCD?",
        "to be an opinion target, ?LED?",
        "is naturally to be an opinion target.",
        "Intuitively, besides opinion relations, semantic relations may provide additional rich clues for indicating opinion targets/words.",
        "Which kind of relations is more effective for opinion targets/words extraction?",
        "Is it beneficial to consider these two types of relations together for the extraction?",
        "To our best knowl-314 edge, these problems have seldom been studied before (see Section 2).",
        "2) Ignoring word preference.",
        "When employing opinion relations to perform mutual reinforcing extraction between opinion targets and opinion words, previous methods depended on opinion associations among words, but seldom considered word preference.",
        "Word preference denotes a word's preferred collocations.",
        "Intuitively, the confidence of a candidate being an opinion target (opinion word) should mostly be determined by its word preferences rather than all words having opinion relations with it.",
        "For example ?This camera's price is expensive for me.?",
        "?It's price is good.?",
        "?Canon 40D has a good price.?",
        "In these three sentences, ?price?",
        "is modified by ?good?",
        "more times than ?expensive?.",
        "In traditional extraction strategy, opinion associations are usually computed based on the co-occurrence frequency.",
        "Thus, ?good?",
        "has more strong opinion association with ?price?",
        "than ?expensive?, and it would have more contributions on determining ?price?",
        "to be an opinion target or not.",
        "It's unreasonable.",
        "?Expensive?",
        "actually has more relatedness with ?price?",
        "than ?good?, and ?expen- sive?",
        "is likely to be a word preference for ?price?.",
        "The confidence of ?price?",
        "being an opinion target should be influenced by ?expensive?",
        "in greater extent than ?good?.",

        "Solid curves and dotted lines respectively mean semantic relations and opinion relations between two candidates.",
        "Thus, to resolve these two problems, we present a novel approach with graph co-ranking.",
        "The collective extraction of opinion targets/words is performed in a co-ranking process.",
        "First, we operate over a heterogeneous graph to model semantic relations and opinion relations into a unified model.",
        "Specifically, our heterogeneous graph is composed of three subgraphs which model different relation types and candidates, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "The first subgraph G tt represents semantic relations among opinion target candidates, and the second subgraph G oo models semantic relations among opinion word candidates.",
        "The third part is a bipartite subgraph G to , which models opinion relations among different candidate types and connects the above two subgraphs together.",
        "Then we perform a random walk algorithm onG tt , G oo and G to separately, to estimate all candidates?",
        "confi-dence, and the entries with higher confidence than a threshold are correspondingly extracted as opinion targets/words.",
        "The results could reflect which type of relation is more useful for the extraction.",
        "Second, a co-ranking algorithm, which incorporates three separate random walks on G tt , G oo and G to into a unified process, is proposed to perform candidate confidence estimation.",
        "Different relations may cooperatively affect candidate confidence estimation and generate more global ranking results.",
        "Moreover, we discover each can-didate's preferences through topics.",
        "Such word preference will be different for different candidates.",
        "We add word preference information into our algorithm and make our co-ranking algorithm be personalized.",
        "A candidate's confidence would mainly absorb the contributions from its word preferences rather than its all neighbors with opinion relations, which may be beneficial for improving extraction precision.",
        "We perform experiments on real-world datasets from different languages and different domains.",
        "Results show that our approach effectively improves extraction performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.",
        "2 Related Work There are many significant research efforts on opinion targets/words extraction (sentence level and corpus level).",
        "In sentence level extraction, previous methods (Wu et al., 2009; Ma and Wan, 2010; Li et al., 2010; Yang and Cardie, 2013) mainly aimed to identify all opinion target/word mentions in sentences.",
        "They regarded it as a sequence labeling task, where several classical models were used, such as CRFs (Li et al., 2010) and SVM (Wu et al., 2009).",
        "This paper belongs to corpus level extraction, and aims to generate a sentiment lexicon and a target list rather than to identify mentions in sen-315 tences.",
        "Most of previous corpus-level methods adopted a co-extraction framework, where opinion targets and opinion words reinforce each other according to their opinion relations.",
        "Thus, how to improve opinion relations identification performance was their main focus.",
        "(Hu and Liu, 2004a) exploited nearest neighbor rules to mine opinion relations among words.",
        "(Popescu and Etzioni, 2005) and (Qiu et al., 2011) designed syntactic patterns to perform this task.",
        "(Zhang et al., 2010) promoted Qiu's method.",
        "They adopted some special designed patterns to increase recall.",
        "(Liu et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013a; Liu et al., 2013b) employed word alignment model to capture opinion relations rather than syntactic parsing.",
        "The experimental results showed that these alignment-based methods are more effective than syntax-based approaches for online informal texts.",
        "However, all aforementioned methods only employed opinion relations for the extraction, but ignore considering semantic relations among homogeneous candidates.",
        "Moreover, they all ignored word preference in the extraction process.",
        "In terms of considering semantic relations among words, our method is related with several approaches based on topic model (Zhao et al., 2010; Moghaddam and Ester, 2011; Moghaddam and Ester, 2012a; Moghaddam and Ester, 2012b; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012).",
        "The main goals of these methods weren't to extract opinion targets/words, but to categorize all given aspect terms and sentiment words.",
        "Although these models could be used for our task according to the associations between candidates and topics, solely employing semantic relations is still one-sided and insufficient to obtain expected performance.",
        "Furthermore, there is little work which considered these two types of relations globally (Su et al., 2008; Hai et al., 2012; Bross and Ehrig, 2013).",
        "They usually captured different relations using co-occurrence information.",
        "That was too coarse to obtain expected results (Liu et al., 2012).",
        "In ad-dition, (Hai et al., 2012) extracted opinion tar-gets/words in a bootstrapping process, which had an error propagation problem.",
        "In contrast, we perform extraction with a global graph co-ranking process, where error propagation can be effectively alleviated.",
        "(Su et al., 2008) used heterogeneous relations to find implicit sentiment associations among words.",
        "Their aim was only to perform aspect terms categorization but not to extract opinion targets/words.",
        "They extracted opinion tar-gets/words in advanced through simple phrase detection.",
        "Thus, the extraction performance is far from expectation.",
        "3 The Proposed Method In this section, we propose our method in detail.",
        "We formulate opinion targets/words extraction as a co-ranking task.",
        "All nouns/noun phrases are regarded as opinion target candidates, and all ad-jectives/verbs are regarded as opinion word candi-dates, which are widely adopted by pervious methods (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Qiu et al., 2011; Wang and Wang, 2008; Liu et al., 2012).",
        "Then each candidate will be assigned a confidence and ranked, and the candidates with higher confidence than a threshold will be extracted as the results.",
        "Different from traditional methods, besides opinion relations among words, we additionally capture semantic relations among homogeneous candidates.",
        "To this end, a heterogeneous undirected graph G = (V,E) is constructed.",
        "V = V t ?",
        "V o denotes the vertex set, which includes opinion target candidates v t ?",
        "V t and opinion word candidates v o ?",
        "V o .",
        "E denotes the edge set, where e ij ?",
        "E means that there is a relation between two vertices.",
        "E tt ?",
        "E represents the semantic relations between two opinion target candidates.",
        "E oo ?",
        "E represents the semantic relations between two opinion word candidates.",
        "E to ?",

        "Most previous methods (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Qiu et al., 2011; Wang and Wang, 2008; Liu et al., 2012) only considered opinion relations among words.",
        "Their basic assumption is as follows.",

        "If a candidate is salient inD in but common in D out , it's likely to be an opinion target in D in .",
        "Thus, we use a domain relevance measure (DR) (Hai et al., 2013) to compute I t .",

        "In contrast, opinion words are usually domain-independent.",

        "It's because that we are only interested in topic distribution of opinion tar-gets/words, regardless of other useless words, including conjunctions, prepositions etc.",
        "This model has been proven to be better than the standard LDA model and other LDA variations for opinion mining (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012).",

        "Capturing Opinion Relations: To capture opinion relations among words and construct the transition matrix M to , we used an alignment-based method proposed in (Liu et al., 2013b).",

        "Each opinion target can find its corresponding modifiers in sentences through alignment, in which multiple factors are considered globally, such as co-occurrence information, word position in sen-tence, etc.",
        "Moreover, this model adopted a partially supervised framework to combine syntactic information with alignment results, which has been proven to be more precise than the state-of-the-art approaches for opinion relations identification (Liu et al., 2013b).",
        "After performing word alignment, we obtain a set of word pairs composed of a noun (noun phrase) and its corresponding modified word.",
