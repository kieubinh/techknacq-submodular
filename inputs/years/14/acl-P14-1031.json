        "Abstract",
        "This paper proposes a novel context-aware method for analyzing sentiment at the level of individual sentences.",
        "Most existing machine learning approaches suffer from limitations in the modeling of complex linguistic structures across sentences and often fail to capture non-local contextual cues that are important for sentiment interpretation.",
        "In contrast, our approach allows structured modeling of sentiment while taking into account both local and global contextual information.",
        "Specifically, we encode intuitive lexical and discourse knowledge as expressive constraints and integrate them into the learning of conditional random field models via posterior regularization.",
        "The context-aware constraints provide additional power to the CRF model and can guide semi-supervised learning when labeled data is limited.",
        "Experiments on standard product review datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both the supervised and semi-supervised settings."

        "The ability to extract sentiment from text is crucial for many opinion-mining applications such as opinion summarization, opinion question answering and opinion retrieval.",
        "Accordingly, extracting sentiment at the fine-grained level (e.g. at the sentence-or phrase-level) has received increasing attention recently due to its challenging nature and its importance in supporting these opinion analysis tasks (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "In this paper, we focus on the task of sentence-level sentiment classification in online reviews.",
        "Typical approaches to the task employ supervised machine learning algorithms with rich features and take into account the interactions between words to handle compositional effects such as polarity reversal (e.g. (Nakagawa et al., 2010; Socher et al., 2013)).",
        "Still, their methods can encounter difficulty when the sentence on its own does not contain strong enough sentiment signals (due to the lack of statistical evidence or the requirement for background knowledge).",
        "Consider the following review for example, 1.",
        "Hearing the music in real stereo is a true revelation.",
        "2.",
        "You can feel that the music is no longer constrained by the mono recording.",
        "3.",
        "In fact, it is more like the players are performing on a stage in front of you ...",
        "Existing feature-based classifiers may be effective in identifying the positive sentiment of the first sentence due to the use of the word revelation, but they could be less effective in the last two sentences due to the lack of explicit sentiment signals.",
        "However, if we examine these sentences within the discourse context, we can see that: the second sentence expresses sentiment towards the same aspect ?",
        "the music ?",
        "as the first sentence; the third sentence expands the second sentence with the discourse connective In fact.",
        "These discourse-level relations help indicate that sentence 2 and 3 are likely to have positive sentiment as well.",
        "The importance of discourse for sentiment analysis has become increasingly recognized.",
        "Most existing work considers discourse relations between adjacent sentences or clauses and incorporates them as constraints (Kanayama and Na-sukawa, 2006; Zhou et al., 2011) or features in classifiers Trivedi and Eisenstein (2013; Lazaridou et al. (2013).",
        "Very little work has explored long-distance discourse relations for sentiment analysis.",
        "Somasundaran et al. (2008) defines coreference relations on opinion targets and applies them to constrain the polarity of sentences.",
        "325 However, the discourse relations were obtained from fine-grained annotations and implemented as hard constraints on polarity.",
        "Obtaining sentiment labels at the fine-grained level is costly.",
        "Semi-supervised techniques have been proposed for sentence-level sentiment classification (T?ackstr?om and McDonald, 2011a; Qu et al., 2012).",
        "However, they rely on a large amount of document-level sentiment labels that may not be naturally available in many domains.",
        "In this paper, we propose a sentence-level sentiment classification method that can (1) incorporate rich discourse information at both local and global levels; (2) encode discourse knowledge as soft constraints during learning; (3) make use of unlabeled data to enhance learning.",
        "Specifically, we use the Conditional Random Field (CRF) model as the learner for sentence-level sentiment classi-fication, and incorporate rich discourse and lexical knowledge as soft constraints into the learning of CRF parameters via Posterior Regularization (PR) (Ganchev et al., 2010).",
        "As a framework for structured learning with constraints, PR has been successfully applied to many structural NLP tasks (Ganchev et al., 2009; Ganchev et al., 2010; Ganchev and Das, 2013).",
        "Our work is the first to explore PR for sentiment analysis.",
        "Unlike most previous work, we explore a rich set of structural constraints that cannot be naturally encoded in the feature-label form, and show that such constraints can improve the performance of the CRF model.",
        "We evaluate our approach on the sentence-level sentiment classification task using two standard product review datasets.",
        "Experimental results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both the supervised and semi-supervised settings.",
        "We also show that discourse knowledge is highly useful for improving sentence-level sentiment classification.",
        "2 Related Work There has been a large amount of work on sentiment analysis at various levels of granularity (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "In this paper, we focus on the study of sentence-level sentiment classification.",
        "Existing machine learning approaches for the task can be classified based on the use of two ideas.",
        "The first idea is to exploit sentiment signals at the sentence level by learning the relevance of sentiment and words while taking into account the context in which they occur: Nakagawa et al. (2010) uses tree-CRF to model word interactions based on dependency tree structures; Choi and Cardie (2008) applies compositional inference rules to handle polarity reversal; Socher et al. (2011) and Socher et al. (2013) compute compositional vector representations for words and phrases and use them as features in a classifier.",
        "The second idea is to exploit sentiment signals at the inter-sentential level.",
        "Polanyi and Zaenen (2006) argue that discourse structure is important in polarity classification.",
        "Various attempts have been made to incorporate discourse relations into sentiment analysis: Pang and Lee (2004) explored the consistency of subjectivity between neighbor-ing sentences; Mao and Lebanon (2007),McDon- ald et al. (2007), and T?ackstr?om and McDonald (2011a) developed structured learning models to capture sentiment dependencies between adjacent sentences; Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006) and Zhou et al. (2011) use discourse relations to constrain two text segments to have either the same polarity or opposite polarities; Trivedi and Eisenstein (2013) and Lazaridou et al. (2013) encode the discourse connectors as model features in supervised classifiers.",
        "Very little work has explored long-distance discourse relations.",
        "Somasundaran et al. (2008) define opinion target relations and apply them to constrain the polarity of text segments annotated with target relations.",
        "Recently, Zhang et al. (2013) explored the use of explanatory discourse relations as soft constraints in a Markov Logic Network framework for extracting subjective text segments.",
        "Leveraging both ideas, our approach exploits sentiment signals from both intra-sentential and inter-sentential context.",
        "It has the advantages of utilizing rich discourse knowledge at different levels of context and encoding it as soft constraints during learning.",
        "Our approach is also semi-supervised.",
        "Compared to the existing work on semi-supervised learning for sentence-level sentiment classification (T?ackstr?om and McDonald, 2011a; T?ackstr?om and McDonald, 2011b; Qu et al., 2012), our work does not rely on a large amount of coarse-grained (document-level) labeled data, instead, distant supervision mainly comes from linguistically-motivated constraints.",
        "Our work also relates to the study of posterior regularization (PR) (Ganchev et al., 2010).",
        "PR has been successfully applied to many structured NLP 326 tasks such as dependency parsing, information extraction and cross-lingual learning tasks (Ganchev et al., 2009; Bellare et al., 2009; Ganchev et al., 2010; Ganchev and Das, 2013).",
        "Most previous work using PR mainly experiments with feature-label constraints.",
        "In contrast, we explore a rich set of linguistically-motivated constraints which cannot be naturally formulated in the feature-label form.",
        "We also show that constraints derived from the discourse context can be highly useful for disambiguating sentence-level sentiment.",
        "3 Approach In this section, we present the details of our proposed approach.",
        "We formulate the sentence-level sentiment classification task as a sequence label-ing problem.",
        "The inputs to the model are sentence-segmented documents annotated with sentence-level sentiment labels (positive, negative or neu-tral) along with a set of unlabeled documents.",
        "During prediction, the model outputs sentiment labels for a sequence of sentences in the test document.",
        "We utilize conditional random fields and use Posterior Regularization (PR) to learn their parameters with a rich set of context-aware constraints.",
        "In what follows, we first briefly describe the framework of Posterior Regularization.",
        "Then we introduce the context-aware constraints derived based on intuitive discourse and lexical knowledge.",
        "Finally we describe how to perform learning and inference with these constraints.",
