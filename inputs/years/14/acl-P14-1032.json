        "In recent years, opinion mining has helped customers a lot to make informed purchase decisions.",
        "However, with the rapid growth of e-commerce, customers are no longer satisfied with the overall opinion ratings provided by traditional sentiment analysis systems.",
        "The detailed functions or attributes of products, which are called product features, receive more attention.",
        "Nevertheless, a product may have thousands of features, which makes it impractical for a customer to investigate them all.",
        "Therefore, mining product features automatically from online reviews is shown to be a key step for opinion summarization (Hu and Liu, 2004; Qiu et al., 2009) and fine-grained sentiment analysis (Jiang et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012).",
        "Previous works often mine product features via syntactic constituent matching (Popescu and Et-zioni, 2005; Qiu et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2010).",
        "The basic idea is that reviewers tend to comment on product features in similar syntactic structures.",
        "Therefore, it is natural to mine product features by using syntactic patterns.",
        "For example, in Figure 1, the upper box shows a dependency tree produced by Stanford Parser (de Marneffe et al., 2006), and the lower box shows a common syntactic pattern from (Zhang et al., 2010), where <feature/NN> is a wildcard to be fit in reviews and NN denotes the required POS tag of the wildcard.",
        "Usually, the product name mp3 is specified, and when screen matches the wildcard, it is likely to be a product feature of mp3.",
        "Figure 1: An example of syntax-based product feature mining procedure.",
        "The word screen matches the wildcard <feature/NN>.",
        "Therefore, screen is likely to be a product feature of mp3.",
        "Generally, such syntactic patterns extract product features well but they still have some limitations.",
        "For example, the product-have-feature pattern may fail to find the fm tuner in a very similar case in Example 1(a), where the product is mentioned by using player instead of mp3.",
        "Similarly, it may also fail on Example 1(b), just with have replaced by support.",
        "In essence, syntactic pattern is 336 a kind of one-hot representation for encoding the contexts, which can only use partial and discrete features, such as some key words (e.g., have) or shallow information (e.g., POS tags).",
        "Therefore, such a representation often suffers from the data sparsity problem (Turian et al., 2010).",
        "One possible solution for this problem is using a more general pattern such as NP-VB-feature, where NP represents a noun or noun phrase and VB stands for any verb.",
        "However, this pattern becomes too general that it may find many irrelevant cases such as the one in Example 1(c), which is not talking about the product.",
        "Consequently, it is very difficult for a pattern designer to balance between precision and generalization.",
        "Example 1: (a) This player has an :: fm ::::: tuner.",
        "(b) This mp3 supports :::: wma ::: file.",
        "(c) This review has helped ::::: people a lot.",
        "(d) This mp3 has some ::::: flaws.",
        "To solve the problems stated above, it is argued that deeper semantics of contexts shall be exploited.",
        "For example, we can try to automatically discover that the verb have indicates a part-whole relation (Zhang et al., 2010) and support indicates a product-function relation, so that both sth.",
        "have and sth.",
        "support suggest that terms following them are product features, where sth.",
        "can be replaced by any terms that refer to the target product (e.g., mp3, player, etc.).",
        "This is called contextual semantic clue.",
        "Nevertheless, only using contexts is not sufficient enough.",
        "As in Example 1(d), we can see that the word flaws follows mp3 have, but it is not a product feature.",
        "Thus, a noise term may be extracted even with high contextual support.",
        "Therefore, we shall also verify whether a candidate is really related to the target product.",
        "We call it lexical semantic clue.",
        "This paper proposes a novel bootstrapping approach for product feature mining, which leverages both semantic clues discussed above.",
        "Firstly, some reliable product feature seeds are automatically extracted.",
        "Then, based on the assumption that terms that are more semantically similar to the seeds are more likely to be product features, a graph which measures semantic similarities between terms is built to capture lexical semantic clue.",
        "At the same time, a semi-supervised convolutional neural model (Collobert et al., 2011) is employed to encode contextual semantic clue.",
        "Fi-nally, the two kinds of semantic clues are combined by a Label Propagation algorithm.",
        "In the proposed method, words are represented by continuous vectors, which capture latent semantic factors of the words (Turian et al., 2010).",
        "The vectors can be unsupervisedly trained on large scale corpora, and words with similar semantics will have similar vectors.",
        "This enables our method to be less sensitive to lexicon change, so that the data sparsity problem can be alleviated .",
        "The contributions of this paper include: ?",
        "It uses semantics of words to encode contextual clues, which exploits deeper level information than syntactic constituents.",
        "As a result, it mines product features more accurately than syntax-based methods.",
        "?",
        "It exploits semantic similarity between words to capture lexical clues, which is shown to be more effective than co-occurrence relation between words and syntactic patterns.",
        "In addition, experiments show that the semantic similarity has the advantage of mining infrequent product features, which is crucial for this task.",
        "For ex-ample, one may say ?This hotel has low water pressure?, where low water pressure is seldom mentioned, but fatal to someone's taste.",
        "?",
        "We compare the proposed semantics-based approach with three state-of-the-art syntax-based methods.",
        "Experiments show that our method achieves significantly better results.",

        "2 Related Work In product feature mining task, Hu and Liu (2004) proposed a pioneer research.",
        "However, the association rules they used may potentially introduce many noise terms.",
        "Based on the observation that product features are often commented on by similar syntactic structures, it is natural to use patterns to capture common syntactic constituents around product features.",
        "Popescu and Etzioni (2005) designed some syntactic patterns to search for product feature candidates and then used Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) to remove noise terms.",
        "Qiu et al. (2009) proposed eight heuristic syntactic rules to jointly extract product features and sentiment lexicons, where a bootstrapping algorithm named Double 337 Propagation was applied to expand a given seed set.",
        "Zhang et al. (2010) improved Qiu's work by adding more feasible syntactic patterns, and the HITS algorithm (Kleinberg, 1999) was employed to rank candidates.",
        "Moghaddam and Ester (2010) extracted product features by automatical opinion pattern mining.",
        "Zhuang et al. (2006) used various syntactic templates from an annotated movie corpus and applied them to supervised movie feature extraction.",
        "Wu et al. (2009) proposed a phrase level dependency parsing for mining aspects and features of products.",
        "As discussed in the first section, syntactic patterns often suffer from data sparsity.",
        "Further-more, most pattern-based methods rely on term frequency, which have the limitation of finding infrequent but important product features.",
        "A recent research (Xu et al., 2013) extracted infrequent product features by a semi-supervised classifier, which used word-syntactic pattern co-occurrence statistics as features for the classifier.",
        "However, this kind of feature is still sparse for infrequent candidates.",
        "Our method adopts a semantic word representation model, which can train dense features unsupervisedly on a very large corpus.",
        "Thus, the data sparsity problem can be alleviated.",
        "3 The Proposed Method We propose a semantics-based bootstrapping method for product feature mining.",
        "Firstly, some product feature seeds are automatically extracted.",
        "Then, a semantic similarity graph is created to capture lexical semantic clue, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (Collobert et al., 2011) is trained in each bootstrapping iteration to encode contextual semantic clue.",
        "Finally we use Label Propagation to find some reliable new seeds for the training of the next bootstrapping iteration.",
        "3.1 Automatic Seed Generation The seed set consists of positive labeled examples (i.e. product features) and negative labeled examples (i.e. noise terms).",
        "Intuitively, popular product features are frequently mentioned in reviews, so they can be extracted by simply mining frequently occurring nouns (Hu and Liu, 2004).",
        "However, this strategy will also find many noise terms (e.g., commonly used nouns like thing, one, etc.).",
        "To produce high quality seeds, we employ a Domain Relevance Measure (DRM) (Jiang and Tan, 2010), which combines term frequency with a domain-specific measuring metric called Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) (Dunning, 1993).",
        "Let ?",
        "(t) denotes the LRT score of a product feature candidate t, ?",
        "(t) = p k 1 (1?",
        "p) n 1 ?k 1 p k 2 (1?",
        "p) n 2 ?k 2 p k 1 1 (1?",
        "p 1 ) n 1 ?k 1 p k 2 2 (1?",
        "p 2 ) n 2 ?k 2 (1) where k 1 and k 2 are the frequencies of t in the review corpus R and a background corpus 1 B, n 1 and n 2 are the total number of terms in R and B, p = (k 1 + k 2 )/(n 1 + n 2 ), p 1 = k 1 /n 1 and p 2 = k 2 /n 2 .",
        "Then a modified DRM 2 is proposed, DRM(t) = tf(t) max[tf(?)]",
        "?",
        "1 log df(t) ?",
        "| log ?",
        "(t)| ?min| log ?(?",
        ")| max| log ?(?",
        ")| ?min| log ?(?",
        ")| (2) where tf(t) is the frequency of t inR and df(t) is the frequency of t in B. All nouns in R are ranked by DRM(t) in descent order, where top N nouns are taken as the positive example set V + s .",
        "On the other hand, Xu et al. (2013) show that a set of general nouns seldom appear to be product features.",
        "Therefore, we employ their General Noun Corpus to create the negative example set V ?",
        "s , where N most frequent terms are selected.",
        "Besides, it is guaranteed that V + s ?",
        "V ?",
        "s = ?, i.e., conflicting terms are taken as negative examples.",
        "3.2 Capturing Lexical Semantic Clue in a Semantic Similarity Graph To capture lexical semantic clue, each word is first converted into word embedding, which is a continuous vector with each dimension's value corresponds to a semantic or grammatical interpretation (Turian et al., 2010).",
        "Learning large-scale word embeddings is very time-consuming (Collobert et al., 2011), we thus employ a faster method named Skip-gram model (Mikolov et al., 2013).",
        "3.2.1 Learning Word Embedding for Semantic Representation Given a sequence of training words W = {w 1 , w 2 , ..., w m }, the goal of the Skip-gram model is to learn a continuous vector space EB = {e 1 , e 2 , ..., e m }, where e i is the word embedding of w i .",
        "The training objective is to maximize the 1 Google-n-Gram (http://books.google.com/ngrams) is used as the background corpus.",
        "2 The df(t) part of the original DRM is slightly modified because we want a tf ?",
        "idf -like scheme (Liu et al., 2012).",
        "338 average log probability of using word w t to predict a surrounding word w t+j , ?",

        "t=1 ?",
        "?c?j?c,j 6=0 log p(w t+j |w t ; e t ) (3) where c is the size of the training window.",
        "Basi-cally, p(w t+j |w t ; e t ) is defined as, p(w t+j |w t ; e t ) = exp(e ?",
        "T t+j e t ) ?",
        "m w=1 exp(e ?",
        "T w e t ) (4) where e ?",
        "i is an additional training vector associated with e i .",
        "This basic formulation is impractical because it is proportional to m. A hierarchical softmax approximation can be applied to reduce the computational cost to log 2 (m), see (Morin and Bengio, 2005) for details.",
        "To alleviate the data sparsity problem, EB is first trained on a very large corpus 3 (denoted by C), and then fine-tuned on the target review cor-pusR.",
        "Particularly, for phrasal product features, a statistic-based method in (Zhu et al., 2009) is used to detect noun phrases in R. Then, an Unfolding Recursive Autoencoder (Socher et al., 2011) is trained on C to obtain embedding vectors for noun phrases.",
        "In this way, semantics of infrequent terms in R can be well captured.",
        "Finally, the phrase-based Skip-gram model in (Mikolov et al., 2013) is applied onR.",
        "3.2.2 Building the Semantic Similarity Graph Lexical semantic clue is captured by measuring semantic similarity between terms.",
        "The underlying motivation is that if we have known some product feature seeds, then terms that are more semantically similar to these seeds are more likely to be product features.",
        "For example, if screen is known to be a product feature of mp3, and lcd is of high semantic similarity with screen, we can infer that lcd is also a product feature.",
        "Analogously, terms that are semantically similar to negative labeled seeds are not product features.",
        "Word embedding naturally meets the demand above: words that are more semantically similar to each other are located closer in the embedding space (Collobert et al., 2011).",
        "Therefore, we can use cosine distance between two embedding vectors as the semantic distance measuring metric.",
        "Thus, our method does not rely on term frequency 3 Wikipedia(http://www.wikipedia.org) is used in practice.",
        "to rank candidates.",
        "This could potentially improve the ability of mining infrequent product features.",
        "Formally, we create a semantic similarity graph G = (V,E,W ), where V = {V s ?",
        "V c } is the vertex set, which contains the labeled seed set V s and the unlabeled candidate set V c ; E is the edge set which connects every vertex pair (u, v), where u, v ?",
        "V ; W = {w uv : cos(EB u , EB v )} is a function which associates a weight to each edge.",
        "3.3 Encoding Contextual Semantic Clue Using Convolutional Neural Network The CNN is trained on each occurrence of seeds that is found in review texts.",
        "Then for a candidate term t, the CNN classifies all of its occurrences.",
        "Since seed terms tend to have high frequency in review texts, only a few seeds will be enough to provide plenty of occurrences for the training.",
        "3.3.1 The architecture of the Convolutional Neural Network The architecture of the Convolutional Neural Network is shown in Figure 2.",
        "For a product feature candidate t in sentence s, every consecutive subsequence q i of s that containing t with a window of length l is fed to the CNN.",
        "For example, as in Figure 2, if t = {screen}, and l = 3, there are three inputs: q 1 = [the, ipod, screen], q 2 = [ipod, screen, is], q 3 = [screen, is, impressive].",

        "To get the output score, q i is first converted into a concatenated vector x i = [e 1 ; e 2 ; ...; e l ], where e j is the word embedding of the j-th word.",
        "In this way, the CNN serves as a soft pattern miner: 4 Otherwise, the CNN will quickly get overfitting on t, because very few seed lexicons are used for the training.",
        "339 since words that have similar semantics have similar low-dimension embedding vectors, the CNN is less sensitive to lexicon change.",
