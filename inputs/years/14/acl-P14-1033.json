        "Aspect extraction aims to extract target entities and their aspects (or attributes) that people have expressed opinions upon (Hu and Liu, 2004, Liu, 2012).",
        "For example, in ?The voice is not clear,?",
        "the aspect term is ?voice.?",
        "Aspect extraction has two subtasks: aspect term extraction and aspect term resolution.",
        "Aspect term resolution groups extracted synonymous aspect terms together.",
        "For ex-ample, ?voice?",
        "and ?sound?",
        "should be grouped together as they refer to the same aspect of phones.",
        "Recently, topic models have been extensively applied to aspect extraction because they can perform both subtasks at the same time while other existing methods all need two separate steps (see Section 2).",
        "Traditional topic models such as LDA (Blei et al., 2003) and pLSA (Hofmann, 1999) are unsupervised methods for extracting latent topics in text documents.",
        "Topics are aspects in our task.",
        "Each aspect (or topic) is a distribution over (aspect) terms.",
        "However, researchers have shown that fully unsupervised models often produce incoherent topics because the objective functions of topic models do not always correlate well with human judgments (Chang et al., 2009).",
        "To tackle the problem, several semi-supervised topic models, also called knowledge-based topic models, have been proposed.",
        "DF-LDA (Andrze- jewski et al., 2009) can incorporate two forms of prior knowledge from the user: must-links and cannot-links.",
        "A must-link implies that two terms (or words) should belong to the same topic whereas a cannot-link indicates that two terms should not be in the same topic.",
        "In a similar but more generic vein, must-sets and cannot-sets are used in MC-LDA (Chen et al., 2013b).",
        "Other related works include (Andrzejewski et al., 2011, Chen et al., 2013a, Chen et al., 2013c, Mukherjee and Liu, 2012, Hu et al., 2011, Jagarlamudi et al., 2012, Lu et al., 2011, Petterson et al., 2010).",
        "They all allow prior knowledge to be specified by the user to guide the modeling process.",
        "In this paper, we take a major step further.",
        "We mine the prior knowledge directly from a large amount of relevant data without any user inter-vention, and thus make this approach fully automatic.",
        "We hypothesize that it is possible to learn quality prior knowledge from the big data (of reviews) available on the Web.",
        "The intuition is that although every domain is different, there is a decent amount of aspect overlapping across domains.",
        "For example, every product domain has the aspect/topic of ?price,?",
        "most electronic products share the aspect ?battery?",
        "and some also share ?screen.?",
        "Thus, the shared aspect knowl-347 edge mined from a set of domains can potentially help improve aspect extraction in each of these domains, as well as in new domains.",
        "Our proposed method aims to achieve this objective.",
        "There are two major challenges: (1) learning quality knowledge from a large number of domains, and (2) making the extraction model fault-tolerant, i.e., capable of handling possibly incorrect learned knowledge.",
        "We briefly introduce the proposed method below, which consists of two steps.",
        "Learning quality knowledge: Clearly, learned knowledge from only a single domain can be erroneous.",
        "However, if the learned knowledge is shared by multiple domains, the knowledge is more likely to be of high quality.",
        "We thus propose to first use LDA to learn topics/aspects from each individual domain and then discover the shared aspects (or topics) and aspect terms among a subset of domains.",
        "These shared aspects and aspect terms are more likely to be of good quality.",
        "They can serve as the prior knowledge to guide a model to extract aspects.",
        "A piece of knowledge is a set of semantically coherent (aspect) terms which are likely to belong to the same topic or aspect, i.e., similar to a must-link, but mined automatically.",
        "Extraction guided by learned knowledge: For reliable aspect extraction using the learned prior knowledge, we must account for possible errors in the knowledge.",
        "In particular, a piece of automatically learned knowledge may be wrong or domain specific (i.e., the words in the knowledge are semantically coherent in some domains but not in others).",
        "To leverage such knowledge, the system must detect those inappropriate pieces of knowledge.",
        "We propose a method to solve this problem, which also results in a new topic model, called AKL (Automated Knowledge LDA), whose inference can exploit the automatically learned prior knowledge and handle the issues of incorrect knowledge to produce superior aspects.",
        "In summary, this paper makes the following contributions: 1.",
        "It proposes to exploit the big data to learn prior knowledge and leverage the knowledge in topic models to extract more coherent aspects.",
        "The process is fully automatic.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing models for aspect extraction is able to achieve this.",
        "2.",
        "It proposes an effective method to learn quality knowledge from raw topics produced using review corpora from many different domains.",
        "3.",
        "It proposes a new inference mechanism for topic modeling, which can handle incorrect knowledge in aspect extraction.",
        "2 Related Work Aspect extraction has been studied by many researchers in sentiment analysis (Liu, 2012, Pang and Lee, 2008), e.g., using supervised sequence labeling or classification (Choi and Cardie, 2010, Jakob and Gurevych, 2010, Kobayashi et al., 2007, Li et al., 2010, Yang and Cardie, 2013) and using word frequency and syntactic patterns (Hu and Liu, 2004, Ku et al., 2006, Liu et al., 2013, Popescu and Etzioni, 2005, Qiu et al., 2011, So-masundaran and Wiebe, 2009, Wu et al., 2009, Xu et al., 2013, Yu et al., 2011, Zhao et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2013, Zhuang et al., 2006).",
        "However, these works only perform extraction but not aspect term grouping or resolution.",
        "Separate aspect term grouping has been done in (Carenini et al., 2005, Guo et al., 2009, Zhai et al., 2011).",
        "They assume that aspect terms have been extracted beforehand.",
        "To extract and group aspects simultaneously, topic models have been applied by researchers (Branavan et al., 2008, Brody and Elhadad, 2010, Chen et al., 2013b, Fang and Huang, 2012, He et al., 2011, Jo and Oh, 2011, Kim et al., 2013, Lazaridou et al., 2013, Li et al., 2011, Lin and He, 2009, Lu et al., 2009, Lu et al., 2012, Lu and Zhai, 2008, Mei et al., 2007, Moghaddam and Es-ter, 2013, Mukherjee and Liu, 2012, Sauper and Barzilay, 2013, Titov and McDonald, 2008, Wang et al., 2010, Zhao et al., 2010).",
        "Our proposed AKL model belongs to the class of knowledge-based topic models.",
        "Besides the knowledge-based topic models discussed in Section 1, document labels are incorporated as implicit knowledge in (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007, Ramage et al., 2009).",
        "Geographical region knowledge has also been considered in topic models (Eisenstein et al., 2010).",
        "All of these models assume that the prior knowledge is correct.",
        "GK-LDA (Chen et al., 2013a) is the only knowledge-based topic model that deals with wrong lexical knowledge to some extent.",
        "As we will see in Section 6, AKL outperformed GK-LDA significantly due to AKL's more effective error handling mechanism.",
        "Furthermore, GK-LDA does not learn any prior knowledge.",
        "Our work is also related to transfer learning to some extent.",
        "Topic models have been used to help 348 Input: Corpora DL for knowledge learning Test corpora DT 1: // STEP 1: Learning prior knowledge.",

        "However, transfer learning in these papers is for traditional classification rather than topic/aspect extraction.",
        "In (Kang et al., 2012), labeled documents from source domains are transferred to the target domain to produce topic models with better fitting.",
        "However, we do not use any labeled data.",
        "In (Yang et al., 2011), a user provided parameter indicating the technicality degree of a domain was used to model the language gap between topics.",
        "In contrast, our method is fully automatic without human intervention.",
        "3 Overall Algorithm This section introduces the proposed overall algorithm.",
        "It consists of two main steps: learning quality knowledge and using the learned knowledge.",
        "Figure 1 gives the algorithm.",
        "Step 1 (learning quality knowledge, Lines 1- 16): The input is the review corpora DL from multiple domains, from which the knowledge is automatically learned.",
        "Lines 3 and 5 run LDA on each review domain corpus D i ?",
        "DL to generate a set of aspects/topics A i (lines 2, 4, and 69 will be discussed below).",
        "Line 10 unions the topics from all domains to give A.",
        "Lines 11-14 cluster the topics in A into some coherent groups (or clusters) and then discover knowledgeK j from each group of topics using frequent pattern mining (FPM) (Han et al., 2007).",
        "We will detail these in Section 4.",
        "Each piece of the learned knowledge is a set of terms which are likely to belong to the same aspect.",
        "Iterative improvement: The above process can actually run iteratively because the learned knowledge K can help the topic model learn better topics in each domain D i ?",
        "DL, which results in better knowledge K in the next iteration.",
        "This iterative process is reflected in lines 2, 4, 6-9 and 16.",
        "We will examine the performance of the process at different iterations in Section 6.2.",
        "From the second iteration, we can use the knowledge learned from the previous iteration (lines 6-8).",
        "The learned knowledge is leveraged by the new model AKL, which is discussed below in Step 2.",
        "Step 2 (using the learned knowledge, Lines 17- 20): The proposed model AKL is employed to use the learned knowledge K to help topic modeling in test domains DT , which can be DL or other unseen domains.",
        "The key challenge of this step is how to use the learned prior knowledge K effectively in AKL and deal with possible errors in K. We will elaborate them in Section 5.",
        "Scalability: the proposed algorithm is naturally scalable as both LDA and AKL run on each domain independently.",
        "Thus, for all domains, the algorithm can run in parallel.",
        "Only the resulting topics need to be brought together for knowledge learning (Step 1).",
        "These resulting topics used in learning are much smaller than the domain corpus as only a list of top terms from each topic are utilized due to their high reliability.",
        "4 Learning Quality Knowledge This section details Step 1 in the overall algorithm, which has three sub-steps: running LDA (or AKL) on each domain corpus, clustering the resulting topics, and mining frequent patterns from the topics in each cluster.",
        "Since running LDA is simple, we will not discuss it further.",
        "The proposed AKL model will be discussed in Section 5.",
        "Below we focus on the other two sub-steps.",
        "4.1 Topic Clustering After running LDA (or AKL) on each domain cor-pus, a set of topics is obtained.",
        "Each topic is a distribution over terms (or words), i.e., terms with their associated probabilities.",
        "Here, we use only the top terms with high probabilities.",
        "As discussed earlier, quality knowledge should be shared 349 by topics across several domains.",
        "Thus, it is natural to exploit a frequency-based approach to discover frequent set of terms as quality knowledge.",
        "However, we need to deal with two issues.",
        "1.",
        "Generic aspects, such as price with aspect terms like cost and pricy, are shared by many (even all) product domains.",
        "But specific aspects such as screen, occur only in domains with products having them.",
        "It means that different aspects may have distinct frequencies.",
        "Thus, using a single frequency threshold in the frequency-based approach is not sufficient to extract both generic and specific aspects because the generic aspects will result in numerous spurious aspects (Han et al., 2007).",
        "2.",
        "A term may have multiple senses in different domains.",
        "For example, light can mean ?of little weight?",
        "or ?something that makes things visi-ble?.",
        "A good knowledge base should have the capacity of handling this ambiguity.",
        "To deal with these two issues, we propose to discover knowledge in two stages: topic clustering and frequent pattern mining (FPM).",
        "The purpose of clustering is to group raw topics from a topic model (LDA or AKL) into clusters.",
        "Each cluster contains semantically related topics likely to indicate the same real-world aspect.",
        "We then mine knowledge from each cluster using an FPM technique.",
        "Note that the multiple senses of a term can be distinguished by the semantic meanings represented by the topics in different clusters.",
        "For clustering, we tried k-means and k-medoids (Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 1990), and found that k-medoids performs slightly better.",
        "One possible reason is that k-means is more sensitive to outliers.",
        "In our topic clustering, each data point is a topic represented by its top terms (with their probabilities normalized).",
        "The distance between two data points is measured by symmetrised KL-Divergence.",
        "4.2 Frequent Pattern Mining Given topics within each cluster, this step finds sets of terms that appear together in multiple top-ics, i.e., shared terms among similar topics across multiple domains.",
        "Terms in such a set are likely to belong to the same aspect.",
        "To find such sets of terms within each cluster, we use frequent pattern mining (FPM) (Han et al., 2007), which is suited for the task.",
        "The probability of each term is ignored in FPM.",
        "FPM is stated as follows: Given a set of transactions T, where each transaction t i ?",
        "T is a set of items from a global item set I , i.e., t i ?",
        "I .",
        "In our context, t i is the topic vector comprising the top terms of a topic (no probability attached).",
        "T is the collection of all topics within a cluster and I is the set of all terms in T. The goal of FPM is to find all patterns that satisfy some user-specified frequency threshold (also called minimum support count), which is the minimum number of times that a pattern should appear in T. Such patterns are called frequent patterns.",
        "In our context, a pattern is a set of terms which have appeared multiple times in the topics within a cluster.",
        "Such patterns compose our knowledge base as shown below.",
        "4.3 Knowledge Representation As the knowledge is extracted from each cluster individually, we represent our knowledge base as a set of clusters, where each cluster consists of a set of frequent 2-patterns mined using FPM, e.g., Cluster 1: {battery, life}, {battery, hour}, {battery, long}, {charge, long} Cluster 2: {service, support}, {support, cus-tomer}, {service, customer} Using two terms in a set is sufficient to cover the semantic relationship of the terms belonging to the same aspect.",
        "Longer patterns tend to contain more errors since some terms in a set may not belong to the same aspect as others.",
        "Such partial errors hurt performance in the downstream model.",
        "5 AKL: Using the Learned Knowledge We now present the proposed topic model AKL, which is able to use the automatically learned knowledge to improve aspect extraction.",
        "5.1 Plate Notation Differing from most topic models based on topic-term distribution, AKL incorporates a latent cluster variable c to connect topics and terms.",
        "The plate notation of AKL is shown in Figure 2.",
        "The inputs of the model are M documents, T topics and C clusters.",
        "Each document m has N m terms.",
        "We model distribution P (cluster|topic) as ?",
        "and distribution P (term|topic, cluster) as ?",
        "with Dirichlet priors ?",
        "and ?",
        "respectively.",
        "P (topic|document) is modeled by ?",
        "with a Dirichlet prior ?.",
        "The terms in each document are assumed to be generated by first sampling a topic z, and then a cluster c given topic z, and finally 350 ?",
        "?",
        "z c w NmM ?",
        "T ?",
        "TXC?",
        "?",
        "Figure 2: Plate notation for AKL.",
        "a term w given topic z and cluster c. This plate notation of AKL and its associated generative process are similar to those of MC-LDA (Chen et al., 2013b).",
        "However, there are three key differences.",
        "1.",
        "Our knowledge is automatically mined which may have errors (or noises), while the prior knowledge for MC-LDA is manually provided and assumed to be correct.",
        "As we will see in Section 6, using our knowledge, MC-LDA does not generate as coherent aspects as AKL.",
        "2.",
        "Our knowledge is represented as clusters.",
        "Each cluster contains a set of frequent 2-patterns with semantically correlated terms.",
        "They are different from must-sets used in MC-LDA.",
        "3.",
        "Most importantly, due to the use of the new form of knowledge, AKL's inference mechanism (Gibbs sampler) is entirely different from that of MC-LDA (Section 5.2), which results in superior performances (Section 6).",
        "Note that the inference mechanism and the prior knowledge cannot be reflected in the plate notation for AKL in Figure 2.",
        "In short, our modeling contributions are (1) the capability of handling more expressive knowledge in the form of clusters, (2) a novel Gibbs sampler to deal with inappropriate knowledge.",
        "5.2 The Gibbs Sampler As the automatically learned prior knowledge may contain errors for a domain, AKL has to learn the usefulness of each piece of knowledge dynamically during inference.",
        "Instead of assigning weights to each piece of knowledge as a fixed prior in (Chen et al., 2013a), we propose a new Gibbs sampler, which can dynamically balance the use of prior knowledge and the information in the corpus during the Gibbs sampling iterations.",
        "We adopt a Blocked Gibbs sampler (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2010) as it improves convergence and reduces autocorrelation when the variables (topic z and cluster c in AKL) are highly related.",
        "For each term w i in each document, we jointly sample a topic z i and cluster c i (containing w i ) based on the conditional distribution in Gibbs sampler (will be detailed in Equation 4).",
        "To compute this distribu-tion, instead of considering how well z i matches with w i only (as in LDA), we also consider two other factors: 1.",
        "The extent c i corroborates w i given the corpus.",
        "By ?corroborate?, we mean whether those frequent 2-patterns in c i containing w i are also supported by the actual information in the domain corpus to some extent (see the measure in Equation 1 below).",
        "If c i corroborates w i well, c i is likely to be useful, and thus should also provide guidance in determining z i .",
        "Otherwise, c i may not be a suitable piece of knowledge for w i in the domain.",
        "2.",
        "Agreement between c i and z i .",
        "By agreement we mean the degree that the terms (union of all frequent 2-patterns of c i ) in cluster c i are reflected in topic z i .",
        "Unlike the first factor, this is a global factor as it concerns all the terms in a knowledge cluster.",
        "For the first factor, we measure how well c i corroborates w i given the corpus based on co-document frequency ratio.",
        "As shown in (Mimno et al., 2011), co-document frequency is a good indicator of term correlation in a domain.",
        "Following (Mimno et al., 2011), we define a symmetric co-document frequency ratio as follows: Co-Doc(w,w ? )",
        "= D(w,w ? )",
        "+ 1 (D(w) +D(w ?",
        "))?",
        "1 2 + 1 (1) where (w,w ? )",
        "refers to each frequent 2-pattern in the knowledge cluster c i .",
        "D(w,w ? )",
        "is the number of documents that contain both termsw andw ?",
        "and D(w) is the number of documents containing w. A smoothing count of 1 is added to avoid the ratio being 0.",
        "For the second factor, if cluster c i and topic z i agree, the intuition is that the terms in c i (union of all frequent 2-patterns of c i ) should appear as top terms under z i (i.e., ranked top according to the term probability under z i ).",
        "We define the agreement using symmetrised KL-Divergence between the two distributions (DIST c and DIST z ) corresponding to c i and z i respectively.",
        "As there is no prior preference on the terms of c i , we use the uniform distribution over all terms in c i for DIST c .",
        "For DIST z , as only top 20 terms under z i are usually reliable, we use these top terms 351 with their probabilities (re-normalized) to represent the topic.",
        "Note that a smoothing probability (i.e., a very small value) is also given to every term for calculating KL-Divergence.",
        "GivenDIST c and DIST z , the agreement is computed with: Agreement(c, z) = 1 KL(DIST c , DIST z ) (2) The rationale of Equation 2 is that the lesser divergence between DIST c and DIST z implies the more agreement between c i and z i .",
