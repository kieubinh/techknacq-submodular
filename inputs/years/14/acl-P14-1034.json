        "The-oretically, their latent variable formulation has served as a foundation for more robust models of other linguistic phenomena (Brody and Lapata, 2009).",
        "Modern topic models are formulated as a latent variable model.",
        "Like hidden Markov models (Rabiner, 1989, HMM), each token comes from one of K unknown distributions.",
        "Unlike a HMM, topic models assume that each document is an admixture of these hidden components called topics.",
        "Posterior inference discovers the hidden variables that best explain a dataset.",
        "Typical solutions use MCMC (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004) or variational EM (Blei et al., 2003), which can be viewed as local optimization: searching for the latent variables that maximize the data likelihood.",
        "An exciting vein of new research provides provable polynomial-time alternatives.",
        "These approaches provide solutions to hidden Markov models (Anandkumar et al., 2012), mixture models (Kannan et al., 2005), and latent variable grammars (Cohen et al., 2013).",
        "The key insight is not to directly optimize observation likelihood but to instead discover latent variables that can reconstruct statistics of the assumed generative model.",
        "Unlike search-based methods, which can be caught in local minima, these techniques are often guaranteed to find global optima.",
        "These general techniques can be improved by making reasonable assumptions about the models.",
        "For example, Arora et al. (2012b)'s approach for inference in topic models assume that each topic has a unique ?anchor?",
        "word (thus, we call this approach anchor).",
        "This approach is fast and effective; because it only uses word co-occurrence information, it can scale to much larger datasets than MCMC or EM alternatives.",
        "We review the anchor method in Section 2.",
        "Despite their advantages, these techniques are not a panacea.",
        "They do not accommodate the rich priors that modelers have come to expect.",

        "In Section 3, we regularize the anchor method to trade-off the reconstruction fidelity with the penalty terms that mimic Gaussian and Dirichlet priors.",
        "Another shortcoming is that these models have not been scrutinized using standard NLP evaluations.",
        "Because these approaches emerged from the theory community, anchor's evaluations, when present, typically use training reconstruction.",
        "In Section 4, we show that our regularized models can generalize to previously unseen data?as measured by held-out likelihood (Blei et al., 2003) -- and are more interpretable (Chang et al., 2009; Newman et al., 2010).",
