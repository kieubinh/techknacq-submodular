        "Recent work in NLP has begun to exploit the potential of entity-centric modeling for a variety of tasks: Chambers (2013) places entities at the center of probabilistic frame induction, showing gains over a comparable event-centric model (Cheung et al., 2013); Bamman et al. (2013) explicitly learn character types (or ?personas?)",
        "in a dataset of Wikipedia movie plot summaries; and entity-centric models form one dominant approach in coreference resolution (Durrett et al., 2013; Haghighi and Klein, 2010).",
        "One commonality among all of these very different probabilistic approaches is that each learns statistical regularities about how entities are depicted in text (whether for the sake of learning a set of semantic roles, character types, or linking anaphora to the entities to which they refer).",
        "In each case, the text we observe associated with an entity in a document is directly dependent on the class of entity -- and only that class.",
        "This relationship between entity and text is a theoretical assumption, with important consequences for learning: entity types learned in this way will be increasingly similar the more similar the do-main, author, and other extra-linguistic effects are between them.",
        "1 While in many cases the topically similar types learned under this assumption may be desirable, we explore here the alterna-tive, in which entity types are learned in a way that controls for such effects.",
        "In introducing a model based on different assumptions, we provide a method that complements past work and provides researchers with more flexible tools to infer different kinds of character types.",
        "We focus here on the literary domain, exploring a large collection of 15,099 English novels published in the 18th and 19th centuries.",
        "By accounting for the influence of individual authors while inferring latent character types, we are able to learn personas that cut across different authors more effectively than if we learned types conditioned on the text alone.",
        "Modeling the language used to describe a character as the joint result of that charac-ter's latent type and of other formal variables allows us to test multiple models of character and assess their value for different interpretive problems.",
        "As a test case, we focus on separating character from authorial diction, but this approach can readily be generalized to produce models that provisionally distinguish character from other factors (such as period, genre, or point of view) as well.",
        "2 Literary Background Inferring character is challenging from a literary perspective partly because scholars have not reached consensus about the meaning of the term.",
        "It may seem obvious that a ?character?",
        "is a representation of a (real or imagined) person, and many humanists do use the term that way.",
        "But there is 1 For example, many entities in Early Modern English texts may be judged to be more similar to each other than to entities from later texts simply by virtue of using hath and other archaic verb forms.",
        "370 an equally strong critical tradition that treats character as a formal dimension of narrative.",
        "To describe a character as a ?blocking figure?",
        "or ?first- person narrator,?",
        "for instance, is a statement less about the attributes of an imagined person than about a narrative function (Keen, 2003).",
        "Characters are in one sense collections of psychological or moral attributes, but in another sense ?word- masses?",
        "(Forster, 1927).",
        "This tension between ?referential?",

        "literary theory?",
        "(Woloch, 2003).",
        "Considering primary source texts (as distinct from plot summaries) forces us to confront new theoretical questions about character.",
        "In a plot summary (such as those explored by Bamman et al., 2013), a human reader may already have used implicit models of character to extract high-level features.",
        "To infer character types from raw narrative text, researchers need to explicitly model the relationship of character to narrative form.",
        "This is not a solved problem, even for human readers.",
        "For instance, it has frequently been remarked that the characters of Charles Dickens share certain similarities?including a reliance on tag phrases and recurring tics.",
        "A referential model of character might try to distinguish this common stylistic element from underlying ?personalities.?",
        "A strictly formalist model might refuse to separate authorial diction from character at all.",
        "In prac-tice, human readers can adopt either perspective: we recognize that characters have a ?Dickensian?",
        "quality but also recognize that a Dickens villain is (in one sense) more like villains in other authors than like a Dickensian philanthropist.",
        "Our goal is to show that computational methods can support the same range of perspectives?allowing a provi-sional, flexible separation between the referential and formal dimensions of narrative.",
        "3 Data The dataset for this work consists of 15,099 distinct narratives drawn from HathiTrust Digital Library.",
        "2 From an initial collection of 469,200 volumes written in English and published between 1700 and 1899 (including poetry, drama, and non-fiction as well as prose narrative), we extract 32,209 volumes of prose fiction, remove duplicates and fuse multi-volume works to create the final dataset.",
        "Since the original texts were produced 2 http://www.hathitrust.org by scanning and running OCR on physical books, we automatically correct common OCR errors and trim front and back matter from the volumes using the page-level classifiers and HMM of Underwood et al. (2013) Many aspects of this process would be simpler if we used manually-corrected texts, such as those drawn from Project Gutenberg.",
        "But we hope to produce research that has historical as well as computational significance, and doing so depends on the provenance of a collection.",
        "Gutenberg's decentralized selection process tends to produce exceptionally good coverage of currently-popular genres like science fiction, whereas HathiTrust aggregates university libraries.",
        "Library collections are not guaranteed to represent the past perfectly, but they are larger, and less strongly shaped by contemporary preferences.",
        "The goal of this work is to provide a method to infer a set of character types in an unsupervised fashion from the data.",
        "As with prior work (Bam- man et al., 2013), we define this target, a character persona, as a distribution over several categories of typed dependency relations: 3 1. agent: the actions of which a character is the agent (i.e., verbs for which the character holds an nsubj or agent relation).",
        "2. patient: the actions of which a character is the patient (i.e., verbs for which the character holds a dobj or nsubjpass relation).",
        "3. possessive: the objects that a character possesses (i.e., all words for which the character holds a poss relation).",
        "4. predicative: attributes predicated of a character (i.e., adjectives or nouns holding an nsubj relation to the character, with an inflection of be as a child).",
        "This set captures the constellation of what a character does and has done to them, what they possess, and what they are described as being.",
        "While previous work uses the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit to identify characters and extract typed dependencies for them, we found this approach to be too slow for the scale of our data (a total of 1.8 billion tokens); in particular, syntactic parsing, with cubic complexity in sentence length, and out-of-the-box coreference resolution (with thousands of potential antecedents) prove to be 3 All categories are described using the Stanford typed dependencies (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008), but any syntactic formalism is equally applicable.",
        "371 the biggest bottlenecks.",
        "Before addressing character inference, we present here a prerequisite NLP pipeline that scales well to book-length documents.",
        "4 This pipeline uses the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003), the linear-time MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2007) for dependency parsing (trained on Stanford typed dependencies), and the Stanford named entity recognizer (Finkel et al., 2005).",
        "It includes the following components for clustering character name mentions, resolving pronominal corefer-ence, and reducing vocabulary dimensionality.",
        "3.1 Character Clustering First, let us terminologically distinguish between a character mention in a text (e.g., the token Tom on page 141 of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer) and a character entity (e.g., TOM SAWYER the character, to which that token refers).",
        "To resolve the former to the latter, we largely follow Davis et al. (2003) and Elson et al. (2010): we define a set of initial characters corresponding to each unique character name that is not a subset of another (e.g., Mr. Tom Sawyer) and deterministically create a set of allowable variants for each one (Mr. Tom Sawyer ?",
        "Tom, Sawyer, Tom Sawyer, Mr. Sawyer, and Mr. Tom); then, from the beginning of the book to the end, we greedily assign each mention to the most recently linked entity for whom it is a variant.",
        "The result constitutes our set of characters, with all mentions partitioned among them.",
        "3.2 Pronominal Coreference Resolution While the character clustering stage is essentially performing proper noun coreference resolution, approximately 74% of references to characters in books come in the form of pronouns.",
        "5 To resolve this more difficult class at the scale of an entire book, we train a log-linear discriminative classifier only on the task of resolving pronominal anaphora (i.e., ignoring generic noun phrases such as the paint or the rascal).",
        "For this task, we annotated a set of 832 coreference links in 3 books (Pride and Prejudice, The Turn of the Screw, and Heart of Darkness) and fea-turized coreference/antecedent pairs with: 4 All code is available at http://www.ark.cs.cmu.",

        "In a 10-fold cross-validation on predicting the true nearest antecedent for a pronominal anaphor, this method achieves an average accuracy of 82.7%.",
        "With this trained model, we then select the highest-scoring antecedent within 100 words for each pronominal anaphor in our data.",
        "3.3 Dimensionality Reduction To manage the degrees of freedom in the model described in ?4, we perform dimensionality reduction on the vocabulary by learning word embeddings with a log-linear continuous skip-gram language model (Mikolov et al., 2013) on the entire collection of 15,099 books.",
        "This method learns a low-dimensional real-valued vector representation of each word to predict all of the words in a window around it; empirically, we find that with a sufficient window size (we use n = 10), these word embeddings capture semantic similarity (placing topically similar words near each other in vector space).",
        "6 We learn a 100-dimensional embedding for each of the 512,344 words in our vocabulary.",
        "To create a partition over the vocabulary, we use hard K-means clustering (with Euclidean dis-tance) to group the 512,344 word types into 1,000 clusters.",

        "4 Model In order to separate out the effects that a charac-ter's persona has on the words that are associated with them (as opposed to other factors, such as time period, genre, or author), we adopt a hierarchical Bayesian approach in which the words we observe are generated conditional on a combination of different effects captured in a log-linear (or ?maximum entropy?)",
        "distribution.",
        "Maximum entropy approaches to language modeling have been used since Rosenfeld (1996) to incorporate long-distance information, such as previously-mentioned trigger words, into n-gram language models.",
        "This work has since been extended to a Bayesian setting by applying both a Gaussian prior (Chen and Rosenfeld, 2000), which dampens the impact of any individual fea-ture, and sparsity-inducing priors (Kazama and Tsujii, 2003; Goodman, 2004), which can drive many feature weights to 0.",
        "The latter have been applied specifically to the problem of estimating word probabilities with sparse additive generative (SAGE) models (Eisenstein et al., 2011), where sparse extra-linguistic effects can influence a word probability in a larger generative setting.",
        "In contrast to previous work in which the probability of a word linked to a character is dependent entirely on the character's latent persona, in our model, we see the probability of a word as dependent on: (i) the background likelihood of the word, (ii) the author, so that a word becomes more probable if a particular author tends to use it more, and (iii) the character's persona, so that a word is more probable if appearing with a particular persona.",
        "Intuitively, if the author Jane Austen is associated with a high weight for the word man-ners, and all personas have little effect for this word, then manners will have little impact on deciding which persona a particular Austen character embodies, since its presence is explained largely by Austen having penned the word.",
        "While we address only the author as an observed effect, this model is easily extended to other features as well, including period, genre, point of view, and others.",
        "The generative story runs as follows (Figure 2 depicts the full graphical model): Let there be M unique authors in the data, P latent personas (a hyperparameter to be set), and V words in the vocabulary (in the general setting these may be word types; in our data the vocabulary is the set of 1,000 unique cluster IDs).",

        "But they do have legible associations both with literary genres and with social categories.",
        "Even though gender is not an observable variable known to the model during inference, personas tend to be clearly gendered.",
        "This is not in itself surprising (since literary scholars know that assumptions about character are strongly gen-dered), but it does suggest that diachronic analysis of latent character types might cast new light on the history of gender in fiction.",
        "This is especially true since the distribution of personas across the time axis similarly reveals coherent trends.",

        "8 Conclusion Our method establishes the possibility of representing the relationship between character and narrative form in a hierarchical Bayesian model.",
        "Postulating an interaction between authorial diction and character allows models that consider the effect of the author to more closely reproduce a human reader's judgments, especially by learning to distinguish different character types within a single author's oeuvre.",
        "This opens the door to considering other structural and formal dimensions of narration.",
        "For instance, representation of character is notoriously complicated by narrative point of view (Booth, 1961); and indeed, comparisons between first-person narrators and other characters are a primary source of error for all models tested above.",
        "The strategy we have demonstrated suggests that it might be productive to address this by modeling the interaction of character and point of view as a separate effect analogous to authorship.",
        "It is also worth noting that the models tested above diverge from many structuralist theories of narrative (Propp, 1998) by allowing multiple instances of the same persona in a single work.",
