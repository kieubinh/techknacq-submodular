        "Wikification for tweets aims to automatically identify each concept mention in a tweet and link it to a concept referent in a knowledge base (e.g., Wikipedia).",
        "Due to the shortness of a tweet, a collective inference model incorporating global evidence from multiple mentions and concepts is more appropriate than a non-collecitve approach which links each mention at a time.",
        "In addition, it is challenging to generate sufficient high quality labeled data for supervised models with low cost.",
        "To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semi-supervised graph regularization model to incorporate both local and global evidence from multiple tweets through three fine-grained relations.",
        "In order to identify semantically-related mentions for collective inference, we detect meta path-based semantic relations through social networks.",
        "Compared to the state-of-the-art supervised model trained from 100% labeled data, our proposed approach achieves comparable performance with 31% labeled data and obtains 5% absolute F1 gain with 50% labeled data."

        "Wikification is a particularly useful task for short messages such as tweets because it allows a reader to easily grasp the related topics and enriched information from the KB.",
        "From a system-to-system perspective, wikification has demonstrated its usefulness in a variety of applica-tions, including coreference resolution (Ratinov and Roth, 2012) and classification (Vitale et al., 2012).",

        "However, manual wikification annotation for short documents is challenging and time-consuming (Cassidy et al., 2012).",
        "The challenges are: (i) unlinkability, a valid concept may not exist in the KB.",
        "(ii) ambiguity, it is impossible to determine the correct concept due to the dearth of information within a single tweet or multiple correct answer.",

        "in t 1 in Figure 1.",
        "Linking ?UCONN?",

        "However, when selecting semi-supervised learning frameworks, we noticed another unique challenge that tweets pose to wikification due to their informal writing style, shortness and noisiness.",
        "The context of a single tweet usually cannot provide enough information for prominent mention detection and similarity computing for disambiguation.",
        "Therefore, a collective inference model over multiple tweets in the semi-supervised setting is desirable.",
        "For instance, the four tweets in Figure 1 are posted by the same author within a short time period.",
        "If we perform collective inference over them we can reliably link ambiguous mentions such as ?Gators?, ?Hawks?, and ?Bucks?",
        "to basketball teams instead of other concepts such as the county Bucks County.",
        "In order to address these unique challenges for wikification for the short tweets, we employ graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithms (Zhu et al., 2003; Smola and Kondor, 2003; Blum et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2004; Talukdar and Crammer, 2009) for collective inference by exploiting the manifold (cluster) structure in both unlabeled and labeled data.",

        "We propose a meta path-based unified framework to detect both explicitly and implicitly relevant mentions.",
        "2 Preliminaries Concept and Concept Mention We define a concept c as a Wikipedia article (e.g., Atlanta Hawks), and a concept mentionm as an n-gram from a specific tweet.",
        "Each concept has a set of textual representation fields (Meij et al., 2012), including title (the title of the article), sentence (the first sentence of the article), paragraph (the first paragraph of the article), content (the entire content of the arti-cle), and anchor (the set of all anchor texts with incoming links to the article).",
        "Wikipedia Lexicon Construction We first construct an offline lexicon with each entry as ?m, {c 1 , ..., c k }?, where {c 1 , ..., c k } is the set of possible referent concepts for the mention m. Following the previous work (Bunescu, 2006; Cucerzan, 2007; Hachey et al., 2013), we extract the possible mentions for a given concept c using the following resources: the title of c; the aliases appearing in the introduction and infoboxes of c (e.g., The Evergreen State is an alias of Washington state); the titles of pages redirecting to c (e.g., State of Washington is a redirecting page of Washington (state)); the titles of the disambigua-381 tion pages containing c; and all the anchor texts appearing in at least 5 pages with hyperlinks to c (e.g., WA is a mention for the concept Washington (state) in the text ?401 5th Ave N [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)?WA]] 98109 USA?.",
        "We also propose three heuristic rules to extract mentions (i.e., different combinations of the family name and given name for a person, the headquarters of an organization, and the city name for a sports team).",

        "n (n=7 in this paper) as concept mention candidates if their entries in the lexicon are not empty.",

        "3.1 Principles A single tweet may not provide enough evidence to identify prominent mentions and infer their correct referent concepts due to the lack of contextual information.",
        "To tackle this problem, we propose to incorporate global evidence from multiple tweets and performing collective inference for both mention identification and disambiguation.",
        "We first introduce the following three principles that our approach relies on.",

        "and ?Facebook, Facebook?).",
        "We define the local compatibility to model such set of characteristics.",
        "Principle 2 (Coreference): Two coreferential mentions should be linked to the same concept.",
        "For example, if we know ?nc?",
        "and ?North Car-olina?",
        "are coreferential, then they should both be linked to North Carolina.",
        "Principle 3 (Semantic Relatedness): Two highly semantically-related mentions are more likely to be linked to two highly semantically-related concepts.",
        "For instance, when ?Sweet 16?",
        "and ?Hawks?",
        "often appear together within relevant contexts, they can be reliably linked to two baseketball-related concepts NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship and Atlanta Hawks, respectively.",
        "3.2 Approach Overview Given a set of tweets ?t 1 , ..., t |T | ?, our system first generates a set of candidate concept mentions, and then extracts a set of candidate concept referents for each mention based on the Wikipedia lexicon.",
        "Given a pair of mention and its candidate referent concept ?m, c?, the remaining task of wikification is to assign either a positive label if m should be selected as a prominently linkable mention and c is its correct referent concept, or otherwise a negative label.",
        "The label assignment is obtained by our semi-supervised graph regularization framework based on a relational graph, which is constructed from local compatibility, coreference, and semantic relatedness relations.",
        "The overview of our approach is as illustrated in Figure 2.",

        "A significant portion of recent work considers the two sub-problems mention detection and mention disambiguation separately and focus on the latter by first defining candidate concepts for a deemed mention based on anchor links.",
        "Mention disambiguation is then formulated as a ranking problem, either by resolving one mention at each time (non-collective approaches), or by disambiguating a set of relevant mentions simultaneously (collective approaches).",
        "Non-collective methods usually rely on prior popularity and context similarity with supervised models (Mihalcea and Csomai, 2007; Milne and Witten, 2008b; Han and Sun, 2011), while collective approaches further leverage the global coherence between concepts normally through supervised or graph-based re-ranking models (Cucerzan, 2007; Milne and Witten, 2008b; Han and Zhao, 2009; Kulkarni et al., 2009; Pennacchiotti and Pantel, 2009; Ferragina and Scaiella, 2010; Fernandez et al., 2010; Radford et al., 2010; Cucerzan, 2011; Guo et al., 2011; Han and Sun, 2011; Han et al., 2011; Ratinov et al., 2011; Chen and Ji, 2011; Kozareva et al., 2011; Cassidy et al., 2012; Shen et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013).",
        "Especially note that when applying the collective methods to short messages from social media, evidence from other messages usually needs to be considered (Cassidy et al., 2012; Shen et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013).",
        "Our method is a collective approach with the following novel advancements: (i) A novel graph representation with fine-grained relations, (ii) A unified framework based on meta paths to explore richer relevant context, (iii) Joint identification and linking of mentions under semi-supervised setting.",
        "Two most similar methods to ours were proposed by (Meij et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2013) by performing joint detection and disambiguation of mentions.",
        "(Meij et al., 2012) studied several supervised machine learning models, but without considering any global evidence either from a single tweet or other relevant tweets.",
        "(Guo et al., 2013) explored second order entity-to-entity relations but did not incorporate evidence from multiple tweets.",
        "This work is also related to graph-based semi-supervised learning (Zhu et al., 2003; Smola and Kondor, 2003; Zhou et al., 2004; Talukdar and Crammer, 2009), which has been successfully applied in many Natural Language Processing tasks (Niu et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2006).",
        "We introduce a novel graph that incorporates three fine-grained relations.",
        "Our work is further related to meta path-based heterogeneous information network analysis (Sun et al., 2011b; Sun et al., 2011a; Kong et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2013), which has demonstrated advantages over homogeneous information network analysis without differentiating object types and relational links.",
        "8 Conclusions We have introduced a novel semi-supervised graph regularization framework for wikification to simultaneously tackle the unique challenges of annotation and information shortage in short tweets.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore the semi-supervised collective inference model to jointly perform mention detection and disambiguation.",
        "By studying three novel fine-grained relations, detecting semantically-related information with semantic meta paths, and exploiting the data manifolds in both unlabeled and labeled data for collective inference, our work can dramatically save annotation cost and achieve better performance, thus shed light on the challenging wikification task for tweets.",
