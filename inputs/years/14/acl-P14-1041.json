        "Sentence simplification maps a sentence to a sim-pler, more readable one approximating its content.",
        "Typically, a simplified sentence differs from a complex one in that it involves simpler, more usual and often shorter, words (e.g., use instead of exploit); simpler syntactic constructions (e.g., no relative clauses or apposition); and fewer modifiers (e.g., He slept vs.",
        "He also slept).",
        "In prac-tice, simplification is thus often modeled using four main operations: splitting a complex sentence into several simpler sentences; dropping and reordering phrases or constituents; substituting words/phrases with simpler ones.",
        "As has been argued in previous work, sentence simplification has many potential applications.",
        "It is useful as a preprocessing step for a variety of NLP systems such as parsers and machine translation systems (Chandrasekar et al., 1996), sum-marisation (Knight and Marcu, 2000), sentence fusion (Filippova and Strube, 2008) and semantic role labelling (Vickrey and Koller, 2008).",
        "It also has wide ranging potential societal application as a reading aid for people with aphasis (Carroll et al., 1999), for low literacy readers (Watanabe et al., 2009) and for non native speakers (Siddharthan, 2002).",
        "There has been much work recently on developing computational frameworks for sentence simplification.",
        "Synchronous grammars have been used in combination with linear integer programming to generate and rank all possible rewrites of an input sentence (Dras, 1999; Woodsend and La-pata, 2011).",
        "Machine Translation systems have been adapted to translate complex sentences into simple ones (Zhu et al., 2010; Wubben et al., 2012; Coster and Kauchak, 2011).",
        "And handcrafted rules have been proposed to model the syntactic transformations involved in simplifications (Sid- dharthan et al., 2004; Siddharthan, 2011; Chandrasekar et al., 1996).",
        "In this paper, we present a hybrid approach to sentence simplification which departs from this previous work in two main ways.",
        "First, it combines a model encoding probabilities for splitting and deletion with a monolingual machine translation module which handles reordering and substitution.",
        "In this way, we exploit the ability of statistical machine translation (SMT) systems to capture phrasal/lexical substitution and reordering while relying on a dedicated probabilistic module to capture the splitting and deletion operations which are less well (dele- tion) or not at all (splitting) captured by SMT approaches.",
        "Second, our approach is semantic based.",
        "While previous simplification approaches starts from either the input sentence or its parse tree, our model takes as input a deep semantic representation namely, the Discourse Representation Structure (DRS, (Kamp, 1981)) assigned by Boxer (Curran et al., 2007) to the input complex sentence.",
        "As we 435 shall see in Section 4, this permits a linguistically principled account of the splitting operation in that semantically shared elements are taken to be the basis for splitting a complex sentence into several simpler ones; this facilitates completion (the re-creation of the shared element in the split sen-tences); and this provide a natural means to avoid deleting obligatory arguments.",
        "When compared against current state of the art methods (Zhu et al., 2010; Woodsend and Lapata, 2011; Wubben et al., 2012), our model yields significantly simpler output that is both grammatical and meaning preserving.",
        "2 Related Work Earlier work on sentence simplification relied on handcrafted rules to capture syntactic simplification e.g., to split coordinated and subordinated sentences into several, simpler clauses or to model active/passive transformations (Sid- dharthan, 2002; Chandrasekar and Srinivas, 1997; Bott et al., 2012; Canning, 2002; Siddharthan, 2011; Siddharthan, 2010).",
        "While these handcrafted approaches can encode precise and linguistically well-informed syntactic transformation (us- ing e.g., detailed morphological and syntactic in-formation), they are limited in scope to purely syntactic rules and do not account for lexical simplifications and their interaction with the sentential context.",
        "Using the parallel dataset formed by Simple English Wikipedia (SWKP)1 and traditional English Wikipedia (EWKP)2, more recent work has focused on developing machine learning approaches to sentence simplification.",
        "Zhu et al. (2010) constructed a parallel corpus (PWKP) of 108,016/114,924 complex/simple sentences by aligning sentences from EWKP and SWKP and used the resulting bitext to train a simplification model inspired by syntax-based machine translation (Yamada and Knight, 2001).",
        "Their simplification model encodes the probabilities for four rewriting operations on the parse tree of an input sentences namely, substitution, re-ordering, splitting and deletion.",
        "It is combined with a language model to improve grammaticality and the decoder translates sentences into sim-1SWKP (http://simple.wikipedia.org) is a corpus of simple texts targeting ?children and adults who are learning English Language?",
        "and whose authors are requested to ?use easy words and short sentences?.",
        "2http://en.wikipedia.org pler ones by greedily selecting the output sentence with highest probability.",
        "Using both the PWKP corpus developed by Zhu et al. (2010) and the edit history of Simple Wikipedia, Woodsend and Lapata (2011) learn a quasi synchronous grammar (Smith and Eisner, 2006) describing a loose alignment between parse trees of complex and of simple sentences.",
        "Following Dras (1999), they then generate all possible rewrites for a source tree and use integer linear programming to select the most appropriate simplification.",
        "They evaluate their model on the same dataset used by Zhu et al. (2010) namely, an aligned corpus of 100/131 EWKP/SWKP sentences and show that they achieve better BLEU score.",
        "They also conducted a human evaluation on 64 of the 100 test sentences and showed again a better performance in terms of simplicity, grammaticality and meaning preservation.",
        "In (Wubben et al., 2012; Coster and Kauchak, 2011), simplification is viewed as a monolingual translation task where the complex sentence is the source and the simpler one is the target.",
        "To account for deletions, reordering and substitution, Coster and Kauchak (2011) trained a phrase based machine translation system on the PWKP corpus while modifying the word alignment output by GIZA++ in Moses to allow for null phrasal alignments.",
        "In this way, they allow for phrases to be deleted during translation.",
        "No human evaluation is provided but the approach is shown to result in statistically significant improvements over a traditional phrase based approach.",
        "Similarly, Wubben et al. (2012) use Moses and the PWKP data to train a phrase based machine translation system augmented with a post-hoc reranking procedure designed to rank the output based on their dissimilarity from the source.",
        "A human evaluation on 20 sentences randomly selected from the test data indicates that, in terms of fluency and adequacy, their system is judged to outperform both Zhu et al. (2010) and Woodsend and Lapata (2011) systems.",
        "3 Simplification Framework We start by motivating our approach and explaining how it relates to previous proposals w.r.t., the four main operations involved in simplification namely, splitting, deletion, substitution and reordering.",
        "We then introduce our framework.",
        "436 Sentence Splitting.",
        "Sentence splitting is arguably semantic based in that in many cases, splitting occurs when the same semantic entity participates in two distinct eventualities.",
        "For instance, in example (1) below, the split is on the noun bricks which is involved in two eventualities namely, ?being resistant to cold?",
        "and ?enabling the construction of permanent buildings?.",
        "(1) C. Being more resistant to cold, bricks enabled the construction of permanent buildings.",
        "S. Bricks were more resistant to cold.",
        "Bricks enabled the construction of permanent buildings.",
        "While splitting opportunities have a clear counterpart in syntax (i.e., splitting often occurs whenever a relative, a subordinate or an appositive clause occurs in the complex sentence), completion i.e., the reconstruction of the shared element in the second simpler clause, is arguably semantically governed in that the reconstructed element corefers with its matching phrase in the first simpler clause.",
        "While our semantic based approach naturally accounts for this by copying the phrase corresponding to the shared entity in both phrases, syntax based approach such as Zhu et al. (2010) and Woodsend and Lapata (2011) will often fail to appropriately reconstruct the shared phrase and introduce agreement mismatches because the alignment or rules they learn are based on syntax alone.",
        "For instance, in example (2), Zhu et al. (2010) fails to copy the shared argument ?The judge?",
        "to the second clause whereas Woodsend and Lapata (2011) learns a synchronous rule matching (VP and VP) to (VP.",
        "NP(It) VP) thereby failing to produce the correct subject pronoun (?he?",
        "or ?she?)",
        "for the antecedent ?The judge?.",
        "(2) C. The judge ordered that Chapman should receive psychiatric treatment in prison and sentenced him to twenty years to life.",
        "S 1 .",
        "The judge ordered that Chapman should get psychiatric treatment.",
        "In prison and sentenced him to twenty years to life.",
        "(Zhu et al., 2010) S 2 .",
        "The judge ordered that Chapman should receive psychiatric treatment in prison.",
        "It sentenced him to twenty years to life.",
        "(Woodsend and Lapata, 2011) Deletion.",
        "By handling deletion using a probabilistic model trained on semantic representations, we can avoid deleting obligatory arguments.",
        "Thus in our approach, semantic subformulae which are related to a predicate by a core thematic roles (e.g., agent and patient) are never considered for deletion.",
        "By contrast, syntax based approaches (Zhu et al., 2010; Woodsend and Lapata, 2011) do not distinguish between optional and obligatory arguments.",
        "For instance Zhu et al. (2010) simplifies (3C) to (3S) thereby incorrectly deleting the obligatory theme (gifts) of the complex sentence and modifying its meaning to giving knights and warriors (instead of giving gifts to knights and war-riors).",
        "(3) C. Women would also often give knights and warriors gifts that included thyme leaves as it was believed to bring courage to the bearer.",
        "S. Women also often give knights and warriors.",
        "Gifts included thyme leaves as it was thought to bring courage to the saint.",
        "(Zhu et al., 2010) We also depart from Coster and Kauchak (2011) who rely on null phrasal alignments for deletion during phrase based machine translation.",
        "In their approach, deletion is constrained by the training data and the possible alignments, independent of any linguistic knowledge.",
        "Substitution and Reordering SMT based approaches to paraphrasing (Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003; Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005) and to sentence simplification (Wubben et al., 2012) have shown that by utilising knowledge about alignment and translation probabilities, SMT systems can account for the substitutions and the reorder-ings occurring in sentence simplification.",
        "Following on these approaches, we therefore rely on phrase based SMT to learn substitutions and reordering.",
        "In addition, the language model we integrate in the SMT module helps ensuring better fluency and grammaticality.",
        "3.1 An Example Figure 1 shows how our approach simplifies (4C) into (4S).",

        "To construct this bi-text, Zhu et al. (2010) extracted complex and simple sentences from EWKP and SWKP respectively and automatically aligned them using TF*IDF as a similarity measure.",
        "PWKP contains 108016/114924 complex/simple sentence pairs.",
        "We tokenize PWKP using Stanford CoreNLP toolkit8.",
        "We then parse all complex sentences in PWKP using Boxer9 to produce their DRSs.",
        "Finally, our DRS-Based simplification model is trained on 97.75% of PWKP; we drop out 2.25% of the complex sentences in PWKP which are repeated in the test set or for which Boxer fails to produce DRSs.",

        "For the remaining four complex sentences, Boxer fails to produce DRSs.",
        "These four sentences are directly sent to the phrase-based machine translation system to produce simplified sentences.",
        "4.2 Automatic Evaluation Metrics To assess and compare simplification systems, two main automatic metrics have been used in previous work namely, BLEU and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Index (FKG).",
        "The FKG index is a readability metric taking into account the average sentence length in words and the average word length in syllables.",
        "In its original context (language learning), it was applied to well formed text and thus measured the simplicity of a well formed sentence.",
        "In the context of the simplification task however, the automatically generated sentences are not necessarily well formed so that the FKG index reduces to a measure of the sentence length (in terms of words and syllables) approximating the simplicity level of an output sentence irrespective of the length of the corresponding input.",
        "To assess simplifica-tion, we instead use metrics that are directly related to the simplification task namely, the number of splits in the overall (test and training) data and in average per sentences; the number of generated sentences with no edits i.e., which are identical to the original, complex one; and the average Levenshtein distance between the system's output and both the complex and the simple reference sentences.",
        "BLEU gives a measure of how close a system's output is to the gold standard simple sentence.",
        "Because there are many possible ways of simplifying a sentence, BLEU alone fails to correctly assess the appropriateness of a simplification.",
        "Moreover BLEU does not capture the degree to which the system's output differs from the complex sentence input.",
        "We therefore use BLEU as a means to evaluate how close the systems output are to the reference corpus but complement it with further manual metrics capturing other important factors when 441 evaluating simplifications such as the fluency and the adequacy of the output sentences and the degree to which the output sentence simplifies the input.",
        "4.3 Results and Discussion Number of Splits Table 3 shows the proportion of input whose simplification involved a splitting operation.",
        "While our system splits in proportion similar to that observed in the training data, the other systems either split very often (80% of the time for Zhu and 63% of the time for Woodsend) or not at all (Wubben).",
        "In other words, when compared to the other systems, our system performs splits in proportion closest to the reference both in terms of total number of splits and of average number of splits per sentence.",
        "Data Total number of sentences % split average split / sentence PWKP 108,016 6.1 1.06 GOLD 100 28 1.30 Zhu 100 80 1.80 Woodsend 100 63 2.05 Wubben 100 1 1.01 Hybrid 100 10 1.10 Table 3: Proportion of Split Sentences (% split) in the training/test data and in average per sentence (average split / sentence).",
        "GOLD is the test data with the gold standard SWKP sentences; Zhu, Woodsend, Wubben are the best output of the models of Zhu et al. (2010), Woodsend and Lapata (2011) and Wubben et al. (2012) respectively; Hybrid is our model.",

        "The right part of the table shows that our system generate simplifications which are closest to the reference sentence (in terms of edits) compared to those output by the other systems.",
        "It also produces the highest number of simplifications which are identical to the reference.",
        "Conversely our system only ranks third in terms of dissimilarity with the input complex sentences (6.32 edits away from the input sentence) behind the Woodsend (8.63 edits) and the Zhu (7.87 edits) system.",
        "This is in part due to the difference in splitting strategies noted above : the many splits applied by these latter two systems correlate with a high number of edits.",
        "System BLEU Edits (Complex to System) Edits (System to Simple) LD No edit LD No edit GOLD 100 12.24 3 0 100 Zhu 37.4 7.87 2 14.64 0 Woodsend 42 8.63 24 16.03 2 Wubben 41.4 3.33 6 13.57 2 Hybrid 53.6 6.32 4 11.53 3 Table 4: Automated Metrics for Simplification: average Levenshtein distance (LD) to complex and simple reference sentences per system ; number of input sentences for which no simplification occur (No edit).",

        "The evaluators were allocated a trial set using a Latin Square Experimental Design (LSED) such that each evaluator sees the same number of output from each system and for each test set item.",

        "Typically, discourse level simplification operations such as sentence splitting, sentence reordering, cue word selection, referring expression generation and determiner choice are semantically constrained.",
        "As argued by Siddharthan (2006), correctly capturing the interactions between these phenomena is essential to ensuring text cohesion.",
        "In the future, we would like to investigate how our framework deals with such discourse level simplifications i.e., simplifications which involves manipulation of the coreference and of the discourse structure.",
        "In the PWKP data, the proportion of split sentences is rather low (6.1 %) and many of the split sentences are simple sentence coordination splits.",
        "A more adequate but small corpus is that used in (Siddharthan, 2006) which consists of 95 cases of discourse simplification.",
        "Using data from the language learning or the children reading community, it would be interesting to first construct a similar, larger scale corpus; and to then train and test our approach on more complex cases of sentence splitting.",
