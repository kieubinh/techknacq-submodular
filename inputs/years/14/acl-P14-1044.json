        "Lexical resources are repositories of machine-readable knowledge that can be used in virtually any Natural Language Processing task.",
        "Notable examples are WordNet, Wikipedia and, more re-cently, collaboratively-curated resources such as OmegaWiki and Wiktionary (Hovy et al., 2013).",
        "On the one hand, these resources are heterogeneous in design, structure and content, but, on the other hand, they often provide complementary knowledge which we would like to see integrated.",
        "Given the large scale this intrinsic issue can only be addressed automatically, by means of lexical resource alignment algorithms.",
        "Owing to its ability to bring together features like multilin-guality and increasing coverage, over the past few years resource alignment has proven beneficial to a wide spectrum of tasks, such as Semantic Parsing (Shi and Mihalcea, 2005), Semantic Role La-beling (Palmer et al., 2010), and Word Sense Disambiguation (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012).",
        "Nevertheless, when it comes to aligning textual definitions in different resources, the lexical approach (Ruiz-Casado et al., 2005; de Melo and Weikum, 2010; Henrich et al., 2011) falls short because of the potential use of totally different wordings to define the same concept.",
        "Deeper approaches leverage semantic similarity to go beyond the surface realization of definitions (Nav- igli, 2006; Meyer and Gurevych, 2011; Niemann and Gurevych, 2011).",
        "While providing good results in general, these approaches fail when the definitions of a given word are not of adequate quality and expressiveness to be distinguishable from one another.",
        "When a lexical resource can be viewed as a semantic graph, as with WordNet or Wikipedia, this limit can be overcome by means of alignment algorithms that exploit the network structure to determine the similarity of concept pairs.",
        "However, not all lexical resources provide explicit semantic relations between concepts and, hence, machine-readable dictionaries like Wiktionary have first to be transformed into semantic graphs before such graph-based approaches can be applied to them.",
        "To do this, recent work has proposed graph construction by monosemous linking, where a concept is linked to all the concepts associated with the monosemous words in its definition (Matuschek and Gurevych, 2013).",
        "However, this alignment method still involves tuning of parameters which are highly dependent on the characteristics of the generated graphs and, hence, requires hand-crafted sense alignments for the specific pair of resources to be aligned, a task which has to be replicated every time the resources are updated.",
        "In this paper we propose a unified approach to aligning arbitrary pairs of lexical resources which is independent of their specific structure.",
        "Thanks to a novel modeling of the sense entries and an effective ontologization algorithm, our approach also fares well when resources lack relational structure or pair-specific training data is ab-sent, meaning that it is applicable to arbitrary pairs 468 without adaptation.",
        "We report state-of-the-art performance when aligning WordNet to Wikipedia, OmegaWiki and Wiktionary.",
        "2 Resource Alignment Preliminaries.",
        "Our approach for aligning lexical resources exploits the graph structure of each resource.",
        "Therefore, we assume that a lexical resource L can be represented as an undirected graph G = (V,E) where V is the set of nodes, i.e., the concepts defined in the resource, and E is the set of undirected edges, i.e., semantic relations between concepts.",
        "Each concept c ?",
        "V is associated with a set of lexicalizations L G (c) = {w 1 , w 2 , ..., w n }.",
        "For instance, WordNet can be readily represented as an undirected graph G whose nodes are synsets and edges are modeled after the relations between synsets defined in WordNet (e.g., hypernymy, meronymy, etc.",
        "), and L G is the mapping between each synset node and the set of synonyms which express the concept.",
        "However, other resources such as Wiktionary do not provide semantic relations between concepts and, therefore, have first to be transformed into semantic networks before they can be aligned using our alignment algorithm.",
        "We explain in Section 3 how a semi-structured resource which does not exhibit a graph structure can be transformed into a semantic network.",
        "Alignment algorithm.",
        "Given a pair of lexical resources L 1 and L 2 , we align each concept in L 1 by mapping it to its corresponding concept(s) in the target lexicon L 2 .",
        "Algorithm 1 formalizes the alignment process: the algorithm takes as input the semantic graphs G 1 and G 2 corresponding to the two resources, as explained above, and produces as output an alignment in the form of a set A of concept pairs.",
        "The algorithm iterates over all concepts c 1 ?",
        "V 1 and, for each of them, obtains the set of concepts C ?",
        "V 2 , which can be considered as alignment candidates for c 1 (line 3).",
        "For a concept c 1 , alignment candidates in G 2 usually consist of every concept c 2 ?",
        "V 2 that shares at least one lex-icalization with c 1 in the same part of speech tag, i.e., L G 1 (c 1 ) ?",
        "L G 2 (c 2 ) 6= ?",
        "(Reiter et al., 2008; Meyer and Gurevych, 2011).",
        "Once the set of target candidates C for a source concept c 1 is obtained, the alignment task can be cast as that of identifying those concepts in C to which c 1 should be aligned.",
        "To do this, the algorithm calculates the similarity between c 1 and each c 2 ?",
        "C (line 5).",
        "If their similarity score exceeds a certain value denoted by ?",
        "Algorithm 1 Lexical Resource Aligner Input: graphs H = (V H , E H ), G 1 = (V 1 , E 1 ) and G 2 = (V 2 , E 2 ), the similarity threshold ?, and the combination parameter ?",
        "Output: A, the set of all aligned concept pairs 1: A?",

        "{(c 1 , c 2 )} 8: return A (line 6), the two concepts c 1 and c 2 are aligned and the pair (c 1 , c 2 ) is added to A (line 7).",
        "Different resource alignment techniques usually vary in the way they compute the similarity of a pair of concepts across two resources (line 5 in Algorithm 1).",
        "In the following, we present our novel approach for measuring the similarity of concept pairs.",
        "2.1 Measuring the Similarity of Concepts Figure 1 illustrates the procedure underlying our cross-resource concept similarity measurement technique.",
        "As can be seen, the approach consists of two main components: definitional similarity and structural similarity.",
        "Each of these components gets, as its input, a pair of concepts belonging to two different semantic networks and produces a similarity score.",
        "These two scores are then combined into an overall score (part (e) of Figure 1) which quantifies the semantic similarity of the two input concepts c 1 and c 2 .",
        "The definitional similarity component computes the similarity of two concepts in terms of the similarity of their definitions, a method that has also been used in previous work for aligning lexical resources (Niemann and Gurevych, 2011; Henrich et al., 2012).",
        "In spite of its simplicity, the mere calculation of the similarity of concept definitions provides a strong baseline, especially for cases where the definitional texts for a pair of concepts to be aligned are lexically similar, yet distinguishable from the other definitions.",
        "How-ever, as mentioned in the introduction, definition similarity-based techniques fail at identifying the correct alignments in cases where different wordings are used or definitions are not of high quality.",
        "The structural similarity component, instead, is a novel graph-based similarity measurement technique which calculates the similarity between a pair of concepts across the semantic networks of the two resources by leveraging the semantic 469 Figure 1: The process of measuring the similarity of a pair of concepts across two resources.",
        "The method consists of two components: definitional and structural similarities, each measuring a similarity score for the given concept pair.",
        "The two scores are combined by means of parameter ?",
        "in the last stage.",
        "structure of those networks.",
        "This component goes beyond the surface realization of concepts, thus providing a deeper measure of concept similarity.",
        "The two components share the same backbone (parts (b) and (d) of Figure 1), but differ in some stages (parts (a) and (c) in Figure 1).",
        "In the follow-ing, we explain all the stages involved in the two components (gray blocks in the figure).",
        "2.1.1 Semantic signature generation The aim of this stage is to model a given concept or set of concepts through a vectorial semantic representation, which we refer to as the semantic signature of the input.",
        "We utilized Personalized PageRank (Haveliwala, 2002, PPR), a random walk graph algorithm, for calculating semantic signatures.",
        "The original PageRank (PR) algorithm (Brin and Page, 1998) computes, for a given graph, a single vector wherein each node is associated with a weight denoting its structural importance in that graph.",
        "PPR is a variation of PR where the computation is biased towards a set of initial nodes in order to capture the notion of importance with respect to those particular nodes.",
        "PPR has been previously used in a wide variety of tasks such as definition similarity-based resource alignment (Niemann and Gurevych, 2011), textual semantic similarity (Hughes and Ramage, 2007; Pilehvar et al., 2013), Word Sense Disambiguation (Agirre and Soroa, 2009; Faralli and Navigli, 2012) and semantic text categorization (Navigli et al., 2011).",
        "When applied to a semantic graph by initializing the random walks from a set of concepts (nodes), PPR yields a vector in which each concept is associated with a weight denoting its semantic relevance to the initial concepts.",
        "Formally, we first represent a semantic network consisting of N concepts as a row-stochastic transition matrix M ?",
        "R N?N .",
        "The cell (i, j) in the matrix denotes the probability of moving from a concept i to j in the graph: 0 if no edge exists from i to j and 1/degree(i) otherwise.",
        "Then the PPR vector, hence the semantic signature S v of vector v is the unique solution to the linear sys-tem: S v = (1 ?",
        "?",
        ")v + ?MS v , where v is the personalization vector of size N in which all the probability mass is put on the concepts for which a semantic signature is to be computed and ?",
        "is the damping factor, which is usually set to 0.85 (Brin and Page, 1998).",
        "We used the UKB 1 off-the-shelf implementation of PPR.",
        "Definitional similarity signature.",
        "In the definitional similarity component, the two concepts c 1 and c 2 are first represented by their corresponding definitions d 1 and d 2 in the respective resourcesL 1 and L 2 (Figure 1(a), top).",
        "To improve expressive-ness, we follow Niemann and Gurevych (2011) and further extend d i with all the word forms associated with concept c i and its neighbours, i.e., the union of all lexicalizations L G i (x) for all concepts x ?",
        "{c ?",
        "?",
        "V i : (c, c ? )",
        "?",
        "E i }?",
        "{c}, where E i is the set of edges in G i .",
        "In this component the personalization vector v i is set by uniformly distributing the probability mass over the nodes corresponding to the senses of all the content words in the extended definition of d i according to the sense inventory of a semantic network H .",
        "We use the same semantic graph H for computing the semantic signatures of both definitions.",
        "Any semantic network with a dense relational structure, providing good coverage of the words appearing in the definitions, is a suitable candidate for H .",
        "For this purpose we used the WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) graph which was further enriched by connecting 1 http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/ukb/ 470 each concept to all the concepts appearing in its disambiguated gloss.",
        "2 Structural similarity signature.",
        "In the structural similarity component (Figure 1(b), bottom), the semantic signature for each concept c i is computed by running the PPR algorithm on its corresponding graph G i , hence a different M i is built for each of the two concepts.",
        "2.1.2 Signature unification As mentioned earlier, semantic signatures are vectors with dimension equal to the number of nodes in the semantic graph.",
        "Since the structural similarity signatures S v 1 and S v 2 are calculated on different graphs and thus have different dimensions, we need to make them comparable by unifying them.",
        "We therefore propose an approach (part (c) of Figure 1) that finds a common ground between the two signatures: to this end we consider all the concepts associated with monosemous words in the two signatures as landmarks and restrict the two signatures exclusively to those common concepts.",
        "Leveraging monosemous words as bridges between two signatures is a particularly reliable technique as typically a significant portion of all words in a lexicon are monosemous.",
        "3 Formally, let I G (w) be an inventory mapping function that maps a term w to the set of concepts which are expressed by w in graph G. Then, given two signatures S v 1 and S v 2 , computed on the respective graphs G 1 and G 2 , we first obtain the setM of words that are monosemous according to both semantic networks, i.e., M = {w : |I G 1 (w)|=1 ?",
        "|I G 2 (w)|=1}.",
        "We then transform each of the two signatures S v i into a new sub-signature S ?",
        "v i whose dimension is |M|: the k th component of S ?",
        "v i corresponds to the weight in S v i of the only concept ofw k in I G i (w k ).",
        "As an exam-ple, assume we are given two semantic signatures computed for two concepts in WordNet and Wik-tionary.",
        "Also, consider the noun tradeoff which is monosemous according to both these resources.",
        "Then, each of the two unified sub-signatures will contain a component whose weight is determined by the weight of the only concept associated with tradeoff n in the corresponding semantic signature.",
        "As a result of the unification process, we obtain a pair of equally-sized semantic signatures with comparable components.",
        "2 http://wordnet.princeton.edu 3 For instance, we calculated that more than 80% of the words in WordNet are monosemous, with over 60% of all the synsets containing at least one of them.",
        "2.1.3 Signature comparison Having at hand the semantic signatures for the two input concepts, we proceed to comparing them (part (d) in Figure 1).",
        "We leverage a non-parametric measure proposed by Pilehvar et al. (2013) which first transforms each signature into a list of sorted elements and then calculates the similarity on the basis of the average ranking of elements across the two lists: Sim(S v 1 ,S v 2 ) = ?",
        "|T | i=1 (r 1 i + r 2 i ) ?1 ?",
        "|T | i=1 (2i) ?1 (1) where T is the intersection of all concepts with non-zero probability in the two signatures and r j i is the rank of the i th entry in the j th sorted list.",
        "The denominator is a normalization factor to guarantee a maximum value of one.",
        "The method penalizes the differences in the higher rankings more than it does for the lower ones.",
        "The measure was shown to outperform the conventional cosine distance when comparing different semantic signatures in multiple textual similarity tasks (Pilehvar et al., 2013).",
        "2.1.4 Score combination Finally (part (e) of Figure 1), we calculate the overall similarity between two concepts as a linear combination of their definitional and structural similarities: ?",
        "Sim def (S v 1 ,S v 2 ) + (1 ?",
        "?",
        ")Sim str (S v 1 ,S v 2 ).",
        "In Section 4.2.1, we explain how we set, in our experiments, the values of ?",
        "and the similarity threshold ?",
        "(cf. alignment algorithm in Section 2).",
        "3 Lexical Resource Ontologization In Section 2, we presented our approach for aligning lexical resources.",
        "However, the approach assumes that the input resources can be viewed as semantic networks, which seems to limit its applicability to structured resources only.",
        "In order to address this issue and hence generalize our alignment approach to any given lexical resource, we propose a method for transforming a given machine-readable dictionary into a semantic net-work, a process we refer to as ontologization.",
        "Our ontologization algorithm takes as input a lexicon L and outputs a semantic graph G = (V,E) where, as already defined in Section 2, V is the set of concepts in L and E is the set of semantic relations between these concepts.",
        "Introducing relational links into a lexicon can be achieved in different ways.",
        "A first option is to extract binary 471 relations between pairs of words from raw text.",
        "Both words in these relations, however, should be disambiguated according to the given lexicon (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2008), making the task particularly prone to mistakes due to the high number of possible sense pairings.",
        "Here, we take an alternative approach which requires disambiguation on the target side only, hence reducing the size of the search space significantly.",
        "We first create the empty undirected graph G L = (V,E) such that V is the set of concepts in L and E = ?.",
        "For each source concept c ?",
        "V we create a bag of content words W = {w 1 , .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", w n } which includes all the content words in its definition d and, if available, additional related words obtained from lexicon relations (e.g., synonyms in Wiktionary).",
        "The problem is then cast as a disambiguation task whose goal is to identify the intended sense of each word w i ?",
        "W according to the sense inventory of L: if w i is monosemous, i.e., |{I G L (w i )}| = 1, we connect our source concept c to the only sense c w i of w i and set E := E ?",
        "{{c, c w i }}; else, w i has multiple senses in L. In this latter case, we choose the most appropriate concept c i ?",
        "I G L (w i ) by finding the maximal similarity between the definition of c and the definitions of each sense of w i .",
        "To do this, we apply our definitional similarity measure introduced in Section 2.1.",
        "Having found the intended sense c?",
        "w i of w i , we add the edge {c, c?",
        "w i } to E. As a result of this procedure, we obtain a semantic graph representation G for the lexicon L. As an example, consider the 4 th sense of the noun cone in Wiktionary (i.e., cone 4 n ) which is defined as ?The fruit of a conifer?.",
        "The definition contains two content words: fruit n and conifer n .",
        "The latter word is monosemous in Wiktionary, hence we directly connect cone 4 n to the only sense of conifer n .",
        "The noun fruit, however, has 5 senses in Wiktionary.",
        "We therefore measure the similarity between the definition of cone 4 n and all the 5 definitions of fruit and introduce a link from cone 4 n to the sense of fruit which yields the maximal similarity value (defined as ?",
        "(botany) The seed-bearing part of a plant...?).",
        "4 Experiments Lexical resources.",
        "To enable a comparison with the state of the art, we followed Matuschek and Gurevych (2013) and performed an alignment of WordNet synsets (WN) to three different collaboratively-constructed resources: Wikipedia (WP), Wiktionary (WT), and OmegaWiki (OW).",
        "We utilized the DKPro software (Zesch et al., 2008; Gurevych et al., 2012) to access the information in the foregoing three resources.",
        "For WP, WT, OW we used the dump versions 20090822, 20131002, and 20131115, respectively.",
        "Evaluation measures.",
        "We followed previous work (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012; Matuschek and Gurevych, 2013) and evaluated the alignment performance in terms of four measures: precision, re-call, F1, and accuracy.",
        "Precision is the fraction of correct alignment judgments returned by the system and recall is the fraction of alignment judgments in the gold standard dataset that are correctly returned by the system.",
        "F1 is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.",
        "We also report results for accuracy which, in addition to true posi-tives, takes into account true negatives, i.e., pairs which are correctly judged as unaligned.",
        "Lexicons and semantic graphs.",
        "Here, we describe how the four semantic graphs for our four lexical resources (i.e., WN, WP, WT, OW) were constructed.",
        "As mentioned in Section 2.1.1, we build the WN graph by including all the synsets and semantic relations defined in WordNet (e.g., hypernymy and meronymy) and further populate the relation set by connecting a synset to all the other synsets that appear in its disambiguated gloss.",
        "For WP, we used the graph provided by Matuschek and Gurevych (2013), constructed by directly connecting an article (concept) to all the hyperlinks in its first paragraph, together with the category links.",
        "Our WN and WP graphs have 118K and 2.8M nodes, respectively, with the average node degree being roughly 9 in both resources.",
        "The other two resources, i.e., WT and OW, do not provide a reliable network of semantic rela-tions, therefore we used our ontologization approach to construct their corresponding semantic graphs.",
        "We report, in the following subsection, the experiments carried out to assess the accuracy of our ontologization method, together with the statistics of the obtained graphs for WT and OW.",
        "4.1 Ontologization Experiments For ontologizing WT and OW, the bag of content words W is given by the content words in sense definitions and, if available, additional related words obtained from lexicon relations (see Section 3).",
        "In WT, both of these are in word surface form and hence had to be disambiguated.",
        "For OW, however, the encoded relations, though rela-472 Source Type WT OW Definition Ambiguous 76.6% 50.7% Unambiguous 18.3% 32.9% Relation Ambiguous 2.8% Unambiguous 2.3% 16.4% Total number of edges 2.1M 255K Table 1: The statistics of the generated graphs for WT and OW.",
        "We report the distribution of the edges across types (i.e., ambiguous and un-ambiguous) and sources (i.e., definitions and rela-tions) from which candidate words were obtained.",
        "tively small in number, are already disambiguated and, therefore, the ontologization was just performed on the definition's content words.",
        "The resulting graphs for WT and OW contain 430K and 48K nodes, respectively, each providing more than 95% coverage of concepts, with the average node degree being around 10 for both resources.",
        "We present in Table 1, for WT and OW, the total number of edges together with their distribution across types (i.e., ambiguous and unam-biguous) and sources (i.e., definitions and rela-tions) from which candidate words were obtained.",
        "The edges obtained from unambiguous entries are essentially sense disambiguated on both sides whereas those obtained from ambiguous terms are a result of our similarity-based disambiguation.",
        "Hence, given that a large portion of edges came from ambiguous words (see Table 1), we carried out an experiment to evaluate the accuracy of our disambiguation method.",
        "To this end, we took as our benchmark the dataset provided by Meyer and Gurevych (2010) for evaluating relation disambiguation in WT.",
        "The dataset contains 394 manually-disambiguated relations.",
        "We compared our similarity-based disambiguation approach against the state of the art on this dataset, i.e., the WKTWSD system, which is a WT relation disambiguation algorithm based on a series of rules (Meyer and Gurevych, 2012b).",
        "Table 2 shows the performance of our disambiguation method, together with that of WKTWSD, in terms of Precision (P), Recall (R), F1, and accuracy.",
        "The ?Human?",
        "row corresponds to the inter-rater F1 and accuracy scores, i.e., the upper-bound performance on this dataset, as calculated by Meyer and Gurevych (2010).",
        "As can be seen, our method proves to be very accurate, surpassing the performance of the WKTWSD system in terms of precision, F1, and accuracy.",

        "We show in Table 4 the performance of the two systems on our three datasets.",

        "In addition, as we mentioned earlier, for WN-WP we used the same graph as that of Dijkstra-WSA, since both WN and WP provide a full-fledged semantic network and thus neither needed to be ontologized.",

        "Having lexical resources represented as semantic networks is highly beneficial.",
        "A good example is WordNet, which has been exploited as a semantic network in dozens of NLP tasks (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "A recent prominent case is Wikipedia (Medelyan et al., 2009; Hovy et al., 2013) which, thanks to its inter-article hyperlink structure, provides a rich backbone for structuring additional information (Auer et al., 2007; Suchanek et al., 2008; Moro and Navigli, 2013; Flati et al., 2014).",

        "This approach, however, in addition to setting the threshold for the definition similarity component by means of cross validation, also required other parameters to be tuned, such as the allowed path length (?)",
        "and the maximum number of edges in a graph.",
        "The optimal value for the ?",
        "parameter varied from one resource pair to an-other, and even for a specific resource pair it had to be tuned for each configuration.",
        "This made the approach dependent on the training data for the specific pair of resources that were to be aligned.",
        "Instead of measuring the similarity of two concepts on the basis of their distance in the combined graph, our approach models each concept through a rich vectorial representation we refer to as semantic signature and compares the two concepts in terms of the similarity of their semantic signatures.",
