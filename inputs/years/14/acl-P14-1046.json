        "The resulting model takes advantage of the complementary strengths and weaknesses of corpus and brain activation data to give a more complete representation of semantics.",
        "Evaluations show that the model 1) matches a behavioral measure of semantics more closely, 2) can be used to predict corpus data for unseen words and 3) has predictive power that generalizes across brain imaging technologies and across subjects.",

        "Vector Space Models (VSMs) represent lexical meaning by assigning each word a point in high dimensional space.",
        "Beyond their use in NLP appli-cations, they are of interest to cognitive scientists as an objective and data-driven method to discover word meanings (Landauer and Dumais, 1997).",
        "Typically, VSMs are created by collecting word usage statistics from large amounts of text data and applying some dimensionality reduction technique like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).",
        "The basic assumption is that semantics drives a per-son's language production behavior, and as a result co-occurrence patterns in written text indirectly encode word meaning.",
        "The raw co-occurrence statistics are unwieldy, but in the compressed VSM the distance between any two words is conceived to represent their mutual semantic similarity (Sahlgren, 2006; Turney and Pantel, 2010), as perceived and judged by speakers.",
        "This space then reflects the ?semantic ground truth?",
        "of shared lexical meanings in a language community's vocabulary.",
        "However corpus-based VSMs have been criticized as being noisy or incomplete representations of meaning (Glenberg and Robertson, 2000).",
        "For example, multiple word senses collide in the same vector, and noise from mis-parsed sentences or spam documents can interfere with the final semantic representation.",
        "When a person is reading or writing, the semantic content of each word will be necessarily activated in the mind, and so in patterns of activity over individual neurons.",
        "In principle then, brain activity could replace corpus data as input to a VSM, and contemporary imaging techniques allow us to attempt this.",
        "Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Magnetoencephalog-raphy (MEG) are two brain activation recording technologies that measure neuronal activation in aggregate, and have been shown to have a predictive relationship with models of word meaning (Mitchell et al., 2008; Palatucci et al., 2009; Sudre et al., 2012; Murphy et al., 2012b).",
        "1 If brain activation data encodes semantics, we theorized that including brain data in a model of semantics could result in a model more consistent with semantic ground truth.",
        "However, the inclusion of brain data will only improve a text-based model if brain data contains semantic information not readily available in the corpus.",
        "In addition, if a semantic test involves another subject's brain activation data, performance can improve only if the additional semantic information is consistent across brains.",
        "Of course, brains differ in shape, size and in connectivity, so additional information encoded in one brain might not translate to an-1 For more details on fMRI and MEG, see Section 4.2 489 other.",
        "Furthermore, different brain imaging technologies measure very different correlates of neuronal activity.",
        "Due to these differences, it is possible that one subject's brain activation data cannot improve a model's performance on another sub-ject's brain data, or for brain data collected using a different recording technology.",
        "Indeed, inter-subject models of brain activation is an open research area (Conroy et al., 2013), as is learning the relationship between recording technologies (En- gell et al., 2012; Hall et al., 2013).",
        "Brain data can also be corrupted by many types of noise (e.g. recording room interference, movement artifacts), another possible hindrance to the use of brain data in VSMs.",
        "VSMs are interesting from both engineering and scientific standpoints.",
        "In this work we focus on the scientific question: Can the inclusion of brain data improve semantic representations learned from corpus data?",
        "What can we learn from such a model?",
        "From an engineering perspective, brain activation data will likely never replace text data.",
        "Brain activation recordings are both expensive and time consuming to collect, whereas textual data is vast and much of it is free to download.",
        "However, from a scientific perspective, combining text and brain data could lead to more consistent semantic models, in turn leading to a better understanding of semantics and semantic modeling generally.",
        "In this paper, we leverage both kinds of data to build a hybrid VSM using a new matrix factorization method (JNNSE).",
        "Our hypothesis is that the noise of brain and corpus derived statistics will be largely orthogonal, and so the two data sources will have complementary strengths as input to VSMs.",
        "If this hypothesis is correct, we should find that the resulting VSM is more successful in modeling word semantics as encoded in human judgements, as well as separate corpus and brain data that was not used in the derivation of the model.",
        "We will show that our method: 1. creates a VSM that is more correlated to an independent measure of word semantics.",
        "2. produces word vectors that are more predictable from the brain activity of different people, even when brain data is collected with a different recording technology.",
        "3. predicts corpus representations of withheld words more accurately than a model that does not combine data sources.",
        "4. directly maps semantic concepts onto the brain by jointly learning neural representations.",
        "Together, these results suggest that corpus and brain activation data measure semantics in compatible and complimentary ways.",
        "Our results are evidence that a joint model of brain- and text-based semantics may be closer to semantic ground truth than text-only models.",
        "Our findings also indicate that there is additional semantic information available in brain activation data that is not present in corpus data, and that there are elements of semantics currently lacking in text-based VSMs.",
        "We have made available the top performing VSMs created with brain and text data (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/ ?",

        "Equation 2 constrains D to eliminate solutions where A is made arbitrarily small by making D arbitrarily large.",

        "We may increase ` to give more dimensional space to represent word semantics, or decrease ` for more compact representations.",
        "490 The sparse and non-negative representation in A produces a more interpretable semantic space, where interpretability is quantified with a behavioral task (Chang et al., 2009; Murphy et al., 2012a).",
        "To illustrate the interpretability of NNSE, we describe a word by selecting the word's top scoring dimensions, and selecting the top scoring words in those dimensions.",
        "For example, the word chair has the following top scoring dimensions: 1. chairs, seating, couches; 2. mattress, futon, mattresses; 3. supervisor, coordinator, advisor.",
        "These dimensions cover two of the distinct meanings of the word chair (furniture and person of power).",
        "NNSE's sparsity constraint dictates that each word can have a non-zero score in only a few di-mensions, which aligns well to previous feature elicitation experiments in psychology.",
        "In feature elicitation, participants are asked to name the characteristics (features) of an object.",
        "The number of characteristics named is usually small (McRae et al., 2005), which supports the requirement of sparsity in the learned latent space.",

        "Our approach allows us to leverage the semantic information in corpus data even for words without brain activation recordings.",
        "JNNSE(Brain+Text) does not require brain data to be mapped to a common average brain, which is often the case when one wants to generalize between human subjects.",
        "Such mappings can blur and distort data, making it less useful for subsequent prediction steps.",
        "We avoid these mappings, and instead use the fact that similar words elicit similar brain activation within a subject.",
        "In the JNNSE algorithm, it is this closeness in ?brain space?",
        "that guides the creation of the latent space A. Leveraging intra-subject distance measures to study inter-subject encodings has been studied previously (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008a; Raizada and Connolly, 2012), and has even been used across species (humans and primates) (Kriegesko- rte et al., 2008b).",
        "Though we restrict ourselves to using one subject per JNNSE(Brain+Text) model, the JNNSE algorithm could easily be extended to include data from multiple brain imaging experiments by adding a new squared loss term for additional brain data.",
        "3.1 Related Work Perhaps the most well known related approach to joining data sources is Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) (Hotelling, 1936), which has been applied to brain activation data in the past (Rus- tandi et al., 2009).",
        "CCA seeks two linear transformations that maximally correlate two data sets in the transformed form.",
        "CCA requires that the data sources be paired (all rows in the corpus data must have a corresponding brain data), as correlation between points is integral to the objective.",

        "The same idea could be applied here: the latent semantic representation generates the observed brain activity and corpus statistics.",
        "Generative and discriminative models both have their own strengths and weaknesses, generative models being particularly strong when data sources are limited (Ng and Jordan, 2002).",
        "Our task is an interesting blend of data-limited and data-rich problem scenarios.",
        "In the past, various pieces of additional information have been incorporated into semantic models.",
        "For example, models with behavioral data (Sil- berer and Lapata, 2012) and models with visual information (Bruni et al., 2011; Silberer et al., 2013) have both shown to improve semantic representations.",
