        "Abstract",
        "Negative expressions are common in natural language text and play a critical role in information extraction.",
        "However, the performances of current systems are far from satis-faction, largely due to its focus on intra-sentence information and its failure to consider inter-sentence information.",
        "In this paper, we propose a graph model to enrich intra-sentence features with inter-sentence features from both lexical and topic perspectives.",
        "Evaluation on the *SEM 2012 shared task corpus indicates the usefulness of contextual discourse information in negation focus identification and justifies the effectiveness of our graph model in capturing such global information.",
        "* 1 Introduction Negation is a grammatical category which comprises various kinds of devices to reverse the truth value of a proposition (Morante and Sporleder, 2012).",
        "For example, sentence (1) could be interpreted as it is not the case that he stopped.",
        "(1) He didn't stop.",
        "Negation expressions are common in natural language text.",
        "According to the statistics on biomedical literature genre (Vincze et al., 2008), 19.44% of sentences contain negative expressions.",
        "The percentage rises to 22.5% on Conan Doyle stories (Morante and Daelemans, 2012).",
        "It is interesting that a negative sentence may have both negative and positive meanings.",
        "For exam-ple, sentence (2) could be interpreted as He stopped, but not until he got to Jackson Hole with positive part he stopped and negative part until he got to Jackson Hole.",
        "Moreover, a nega-* Corresponding author tive expression normally interacts with some special part in the sentence, referred as negation focus in linguistics.",
        "Formally, negation focus is defined as the special part in the sentence, which is most prominently or explicitly negated by a negative expression.",
        "Hereafter, we denote negative expression in boldface and negation focus underlined.",
        "(2) He didn't stop until he got to Jackson Hole.",
        "While people tend to employ stress or intonation in speech to emphasize negation focus and thus it is easy to identify negation focus in speech corpora, such stress or intonation information often misses in the dominating text corpora.",
        "This poses serious challenges on negation focus identification.",
        "Current studies (e.g., Blanco and Moldovan, 2011; Rosenberg and Bergler, 2012) sort to various kinds of intra-sentence in-formation, such as lexical features, syntactic fea-tures, semantic role features and so on, ignoring less-obvious inter-sentence information.",
        "This largely defers the performance of negation focus identification and its wide applications, since such contextual discourse information plays a critical role on negation focus identification.",
        "Take following sentence as an example.",
        "(3) Helen didn't allow her youngest son to play the violin.",
        "In sentence (3), there are several scenarios on identification of negation focus, with regard to negation expression n't, given different contexts: Scenario A: Given sentence But her husband did as next sentence, the negation focus should be Helen, yielding interpretation the person who didn't allow the youngest son to play the violin is Helen but not her husband.",
        "Scenario B: Given sentence She thought that he didn't have the artistic talent like her eldest son as next sentence, the negation focus should be the youngest son, yielding interpretation Helen 522 thought that her eldest son had the talent to play the violin, but the youngest son didn't.",
        "Scenario C: Given sentence Because of her neighbors?",
        "protests as previous sentence, the negation focus should be play the violin, yielding interpretation Helen didn't allow her youngest son to play the violin, but it didn't show whether he was allowed to do other things.",
        "In this paper, to well accommodate such contextual discourse information in negation focus identification, we propose a graph model to enrich normal intra-sentence features with various kinds of inter-sentence features from both lexical and topic perspectives.",
        "Besides, the standard PageRank algorithm is employed to optimize the graph model.",
        "Evaluation on the *SEM 2012 shared task corpus (Morante and Blanco, 2012) justifies our approach over several strong baselines.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 overviews the related work.",
        "Section 3 presents several strong baselines on negation focus identification with only intra-sentence features.",
        "Section 4 introduces our topic-driven word-based graph model with contextual discourse information.",
        "Section 5 reports the experimental results and analysis.",
        "Finally, we conclude our work in Section 6.",
        "2 Related Work Earlier studies of negation were almost in linguistics (e.g. Horn, 1989; van der Wouden, 1997), and there were only a few in natural language processing with focus on negation recognition in the biomedical domain.",
        "For example, Chapman et al. (2001) developed a rule-based negation recognition system, NegEx, to determine whether a finding mentioned within narrative medical reports is present or absent.",
        "Since the release of the BioScope corpus (Vincze et al., 2008), a freely available resource consisting of medical and biological texts, machine learning approaches begin to dominate the research on negation recognition (e.g. Morante et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010).",
        "Generally, negation recognition includes three subtasks: cue detection, which detects and identifies possible negative expressions in a sentence, scope resolution, which determines the grammatical scope in a sentence affected by a negative expression, and focus identification, which identifies the constituent in a sentence most prominently or explicitly negated by a negative expression.",
        "This paper concentrates on the third subtask, negation focus identification.",
        "Due to the increasing demand on deep understanding of natural language text, negation recognition has been drawing more and more attention in recent years, with a series of shared tasks and workshops, however, with focus on cue detection and scope resolution, such as the Bi-oNLP 2009 shared task for negative event detection (Kim et al., 2009) and the ACL 2010 Workshop for scope resolution of negation and speculation (Morante and Sporleder, 2010), followed by a special issue of Computational Linguistics (Morante and Sporleder, 2012) for modality and negation.",
        "The research on negation focus identification was pioneered by Blanco and Moldovan (2011), who investigated the negation phenomenon in semantic relations and proposed a supervised learning approach to identify the focus of a negation expression.",
        "However, although Morante and Blanco (2012) proposed negation focus identification as one of the *SEM?2012 shared tasks, only one team (Rosenberg and Bergler, 2012) 1 participated in this task.",
        "They identified negation focus using three kinds of heuristics and achieved 58.40 in F1-measure.",
        "This indicates great expectation in negation focus identification.",
        "The key problem in current research on negation focus identification is its focus on intra-sentence information and large ignorance of inter-sentence information, which plays a critical role in the success of negation focus identification.",
        "For example, Ding (2011) made a qualitative analysis on implied negations in conversation and attempted to determine whether a sentence was negated by context information, from the linguistic perspective.",
        "Moreover, a negation focus is always associated with authors?",
        "intention in article.",
        "This indicates the great challenges in negation focus identification.",
        "3 Baselines Negation focus identification in *SEM?2012 shared tasks is restricted to verbal negations annotated with MNEG in PropBank, with only the constituent belonging to a semantic role selected as negation focus.",
        "Normally, a verbal negation expression (not or n't) is grammatically associated with its corresponding verb (e.g., He didn't stop).",
        "For details on annotation guidelines and 1 In *SEM?2013, the shared task is changed with focus on \"Semantic Textual Similarity\".",
        "523 examples for verbal negations, please refer to Blanco and Moldovan (2011).",
        "For comparison, we choose the state-of-the-art system described in Blanco and Moldovan (2011), which employed various kinds of syntactic features and semantic role features, as one of our baselines.",
        "Since this system adopted C4.5 for training, we name it as BaselineC4.5.",
        "In order to provide a stronger baseline, besides those features adopted in BaselineC4.5, we added more refined intra-sentence features and adopted ranking Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for training.",
        "We name it as BaselineSVM.",
        "Following is a list of features adopted in the two baselines, for both BaselineC4.5 and Base-lineSVM, ?",
        "Basic features: first token and its part-of-speech (POS) tag of the focus candidate; the number of tokens in the focus candidate; relative position of the focus candidate among all the roles present in the sentence; negated verb and its POS tag of the negative expression; ?",
        "Syntactic features: the sequence of words from the beginning of the governing VP to the negated verb; the sequence of POS tags from the beginning of the governing VP to the negated verb; whether the governing VP contains a CC; whether the governing VP contains a RB.",
        "?",
        "Semantic features: the syntactic label of semantic role A1; whether A1 contains POS tag DT, JJ, PRP, CD, RB, VB, and WP, as defined in Blanco and Moldovan (2011); whether A1 contains token any, anybody, an-ymore, anyone, anything, anytime, anywhere, certain, enough, full, many, much, other, some, specifics, too, and until, as defined in Blanco and Moldovan (2011); the syntactic label of the first semantic role in the sentence; the semantic label of the last semantic role in the sentence; the thematic role for A0/A1/A2/A3/A4 of the negated predicate.",
        "and for BaselineSVM only, ?",

        "Section 1 illustrates the necessity of such contextual discourse information in negation focus identification by giving three scenarios of different discourse contexts for negation expression n't in sentence (3).",
        "For better illustration of the importance of contextual discourse information, Table 1 shows the statistics of intra- and inter-sentence information necessary for manual negation focus identification with 100 instances randomly extracted from the held-out dataset of *SEM'2012 shared task corpus.",
        "It shows that only 17 instances can be identified by intra-sentence information.",
        "It is surprising that inter-sentence information is indispensable in 77 instances, among which 42 instances need only inter-sentence information and 35 instances need both intra- and inter-sentence information.",
        "This indicates the great importance of contextual discourse information on negation focus identification.",
        "It is also interesting to note 6 instances are hard to determine even given both intra- and inter-sentence information.",
        "Info Number #Intra-Sentence Only 17 #Inter-Sentence Only 42 #Both 35 #Hard to Identify 6 (Note: \"Hard to Identify\" means that it is hard for a human being to identify the negation focus even given both intra- and inter-sentence information.)",
        "Table 1.",
        "Statistics of intra- and inter-sentence information on negation focus identification.",
        "Statistically, we find that negation focus is always related with what authors repeatedly states in discourse context.",
        "This explains why contextual discourse information could help identify negation focus.",
        "While inter-sentence information provides the global characteristics from the discourse context perspective and intra-sentence information provides the local features from lex-ical, syntactic and semantic perspectives, both have their own contributions on negation focus identification.",
        "In this paper, we first propose a graph model to gauge the importance of contextual discourse 524 information.",
        "Then, we incorporate both intra- and inter-sentence features into a machine learning-based framework for negation focus identification.",
        "4.1 Graph Model Graph models have been proven successful in many NLP applications, especially in representing the link relationships between words or sentences (Wan and Yang, 2008; Li et al., 2009).",
        "Generally, such models could construct a graph to compute the relevance between document theme and words.",
        "In this paper, we propose a graph model to represent the contextual discourse information from both lexical and topic perspectives.",
        "In par-ticular, a word-based graph model is proposed to represent the explicit relatedness among words in a discourse from the lexical perspective, while a topic-driven word-based model is proposed to enrich the implicit relatedness between words, by adding one more layer to the word-based graph model in representing the global topic distribution of the whole dataset.",
        "Besides, the PageRank algorithm (Page et al., 1998) is adopted to optimize the graph model.",
        "Word-based Graph Model: A word-based graph model can be defined as Gword (W, E), where W={wi} is the set of words in one document and E={eij|wi, wj ?W} is the set of directed edges between these words, as shown in Figure 1.",

        "It also shows that the system with inter-sentence features from the topic-driven word-based graph model significantly improves the F1-measure by 8.86 over the system with inter-sentence features from the word-based graph model, largely due to the usefulness of topic information.",
        "In comparison with Table 3, it shows that the system with only intra-sentence features achieves better performance than the one with only inter-sentence features (59.64 vs. 52.61 in F1-measure).",

        "There are two main reasons.",
        "On the one hand, the former employs an unsupervised approach without prior knowledge for training.",
        "On the other hand, the usefulness of inter-sentence features depends on the assumption that a negation focus relates to the meaning of which is most relevant to authors?",

        "If there lacks relevant information in a discourse context, negation focus will become difficult to be identified only by inter-sentence features.",
        "Error analysis also shows that some of the negation focuses are very difficult to be identified, even for a human being.",
        "Consider the sentence (3) in Section 1, if given sentence because of her neighbors' protests, but her husband doesn't think so as its following context, both Helen and to play the violin can become the negation focus.",
        "Moreover, the inter-annotator agreement in the first round of negation focus annotation can only reach 0.72 (Blanco and Moldovan, 2011).",
        "This indicates inherent difficulty in negation focus identification.",
        "6 Conclusion In this paper, we propose a graph model to enrich intra-sentence features with inter-sentence features from both lexical and topic perspectives.",
        "In this graph model, the relatedness between words is calculated by word co-occurrence, WordNet-based similarity, and topic-driven similarity.",
        "Evaluation on the *SEM 2012 shared task corpus indicates the usefulness of contextual discourse information on negation focus identification and our graph model in capturing such global information.",
        "In future work, we will focus on exploring more contextual discourse information via the graph model and better ways of integrating intra- and inter-sentence information on negation focus identification.",
