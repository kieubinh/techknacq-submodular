        "Automatic extraction of new words is indispensable to many tasks such as Chinese word seg-mentation, machine translation, named entity ex-traction, question answering, and sentiment analysis.",
        "New word detection is one of the most critical issues in Chinese word segmentation.",
        "Recent studies (Sproat and Emerson, 2003) (Chen, 2003) have shown that more than 60% of word segmentation errors result from new words.",
        "Statistics show that more than 1000 new Chinese words appear every year (Thesaurus Research Center, 2003).",
        "These words are mostly domain-specific technical terms and time-sensitive political/social /cultural terms.",
        "Most of them are not yet correctly recognized by the segmentation algorithm, and remain as out of vocabulary (OOV) words.",
        "New word detection is also important for sentiment analysis such as opinionated phrase extraction and polarity classification.",
        "A sentiment phrase with complete meaning should have a correct boundary, however, characters in a new word may be broken up.",

        "In the previous example, \"?",

        "This paper aims to detect new word for sentiment analysis.",
        "We are particulary interested in extracting new sentiment word that can express opinions or sentiment, which is of high value towards sentiment analysis.",
        "New sentiment word, as exemplified in Table 1, is a sub-class of multi-word expressions which is a sequence of neighboring words \"whose exact and unambiguous meaning or connotation cannot be derived from the meaning or connotation of its components\" (Choueka, 1988).",
        "Such new words cannot be directly identified using grammatical rules, which poses a major challenge to automatic analysis.",
        "Moreover, existing lexical resources never have adequate and timely coverage since new words appear constantly.",
        "People thus resort to statistical methods such as Pointwise Mutual Information (Church and Han-ks, 1990), Symmetrical Conditional Probability 531 (da Silva and Lopes, 1999), Mutual Expectation (Dias et al., 2000), Enhanced Mutual Information (Zhang et al., 2009), and Multi-word Expression Distance (Bu et al., 2010).",

        "Our central idea for new sentiment word detection is as follows: Starting from very few seed words (for example, just one seed word), we can extract lexical patterns that have strong statistical association with the seed words; the extracted lexical patterns can be further used in finding more new words, and the most probable new words can be added into the seed word set for the next iter-ation; and the process can be run iteratively until a stop condition is met.",

        "Wewill describe the proposedmethod in Section 3, including definitions, the overview of the algorith-m, and the statistical measures for addressing the two key issues.",
        "We then present the experiments in Section 4.",
        "Finally, the work is summarized in Section 5.",
        "2 Related Work New word detection has been usually inter-weaved with word segmentation, particularly in Chinese NLP.",
        "In these works, new word detection is considered as an integral part of segmentation, where new words are identified as the most probable segments inferred by the probabilistic models; and the detected new word can be further used to improve word segmentation.",
        "Typical models include conditional random fields proposed by (Peng et al., 2004), and a joint model trained with adaptive online gradient descent based on feature frequency information (Sun et al., 2012).",
        "Another line is to treat new word detection as a separate task, usually preceded by part-of-speech tagging.",
        "The first genre of such studies is to leverage complex linguistic rules or knowledge.",
        "For example, Justeson and Katz (1995) extracted technical terminologies from documents using a regular expression.",
        "Argamon et al. (1998) segmented the POS sequence of a multi-word into small POS tiles, counted tile frequency in the new word and non-new-word on the training set respectively, and detected new words using these counts.",
        "Chen and Ma (2002) employed morphological and statistical rules to extract Chinese new word.",
        "The second genre of the studies is to treat new word detection as a classification problem.",
        "Zhou (2005) proposed a discriminative Markov Model to detect new words by chunking one or more separated words.",
        "In (Li et al., 2005), new word detection was viewed as a binary classification problem.",
        "However, these supervisedmodels requires not only heavy engineering of linguistic features, but also expensive annotation of training data.",
        "User behavior data has recently been explored for finding new words.",
        "Zheng et al. (2009) explored user typing behaviors in Sogou Chinese Pinyin input method to detect new words.",
        "Zhang et al. (2010) proposed to use dynamic time warping to detect new words from query logs.",
        "Howev-er, both of the work are limited due to the public unavailability of expensive commercial resources.",
        "Statistical methods for new word detection have been extensively studied, and in some sense exhibit advantages over linguistics-based methods. In this setting, new word detection is mostly 532 known as multi-word expression extraction.",
        "To measure multi-word association, the first model is Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) (Church and Hanks, 1990).",
        "Since then, a variety of statistical methods have been proposed to measure bi-gram association, such as Log-likelihood (Dun- ning, 1993) and Symmetrical Conditional Probability (SCP) (da Silva and Lopes, 1999).",
        "Among all the 84 bi-gram association measures, PMI has been reported to be the best one in Czech data (Pecina, 2005).",
        "In order to measure arbitrary n-grams, most common strategies are to separate n-gram into two parts X and Y so that existing bi-gram methods can be used (da Silva and Lopes, 1999; Dias et al., 2000; Schone and Jurafsky, 2001).",
        "Zhang et al. (2009) proposed Enhanced Mutual Information (EMI) which measures the cohesion of n-gram by the frequency of itself and the frequency of each single word.",
        "Based on the information distance theory, Bu et al. (2010) proposed multi-word expression distance (MED) and the normalized version, and reported superior performance to EMI, SCP, and other measures.",

        "In order to obtain lexical patterns, we can define regular expressions with POS tags 2 and apply the regular expressions on POS tagged texts.",
        "Since the tags of adverbial and auxiliary words are 1We set the number to 3 words in this work considering computation costs.",
        "2Such expressions are very simple and easy to write because we only need to consider POS tags of adverbial and auxiliary word.",

        "Subsequently, the extracted lexical patterns can be further used in finding more new words.",

        "Note that we do not augment the pattern set (P) at each iteration, instead, we keep a fixed small number of patterns during iteration because this strategy produces optimal results.",
        "From linguistic perspectives, new sentiment words are commonly modified by adverbial words and thus can be extracted by lexical patterns.",
        "This is the reason why the algorithm will work.",
        "Our algorithm is in spirit to double propagation (Qiu et al., 2011), however, the differences are apparent in that: firstly, we use very lightweight linguistic information (except POS tags); secondly, our major contributions are to propose statistical measures to address the following key issues: first, to measure the utility of lexical patterns; second, to measure the possibility of a candidate word being a new word.",
        "3.3 Measuring the Utility of a Pattern The first key issue is to quantify the utility of a pattern at each iteration.",

        "3.4 Measuring the Possibility of Being New Words Another key issue in the proposed algorithm is to quantify the possibility of a candidate word being a new word.",
        "We consider several factors for this purpose.",
        "3.4.1 Likelihood Ratio Test Very similar to the pattern utility measure, LRT can also be used to measure the association of a candidate word to a given pattern set, as follows: LRT (w) = ?",

        "It tells nothing about the possibility of a word being a new word, however, a new sentiment word, should have close association with the lexical patterns.",
        "This has linguistic interpretations because new sentiment words are commonly modified by adverbial words and thus should have close association with lexical patterns.",
        "This measure is proved to be an influential factor by our experiments in Section 4.3.",
        "534 3.4.2 Left Pattern Entropy If a candidate word is a new word, it will be more commonly used with diversified lexical patterns since the non-compositionality of new word means that the word can be used in many different linguistic scenarios.",
        "This can be measured by information entropy, as follows: LPE(w) = ?",
        "?",
        "l i ?L(P c ,w) c(l i , w) N(w) ?",

        "Note that we use P c , instead of P , because the latter set is very small while computing entropy needs a large number of patterns.",
        "Tuning the size of P c will be further discussed in Section 4.4.",
        "3.4.3 New Word Probability Some words occur very frequently and can be widely matched by lexical patterns, but they are not new words.",
        "For example, \"??",
        "(love to eat)\" and \"??",
        "(love to talk)\" can be matched by many lexical patterns, however, they are not new words due to the lack of non-compositionality.",
        "In such words, each single character has high probability to be a word.",
