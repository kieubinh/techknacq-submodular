        "More advanced methods such as (Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006) adopt domain knowledge by extracting sentiment words from the domain-specific corpus.",
        "However, depending on the context, the same word can have different polarities even in the same domain (Liu, 2012).",
        "In respect to sentiment classification, Pang et al. (2002) infer the sentiments using basic features, such as bag-of-words.",
        "To capture more complex linguistic phenomena, leading approaches (Naka- gawa et al., 2010; Jo and Oh, 2011; Kim et al., 2013) apply more advanced models but assume one document or sentence holds one sentiment.",
        "However, this is often not the case.",
        "Sentiments can change within one document, one sentence, or even one clause.",
        "Also, existing approaches infer sentiments without considering the changes of sentiments within or between clauses.",
        "However, these changes can be successfully exploited for inferring fine-grained sentiments.",
        "To address the above shortcomings of lexicon and granularity, we propose a semi-supervised framework named ReNew.",
        "(1) Instead of using sentences, ReNew uses segments as the basic units for sentiment classification.",
        "Segments can be shorter than sentences and therefore help capture fine-grained sentiments.",
        "(2) ReNew leverages the relationships between consecutive segments to infer their sentiments and automatically generates a domain-specific sentiment lexicon in a semi-supervised fashion.",
        "(3) To capture the contextual sentiment of words, ReNew uses dependency relation pairs as the basic elements in the generated sentiment lexicon.",

Each review r from dataset T is first normalized by a set of hard-coded rules (lines 2?4) to remove unnecessary punctuations and HTML tags, expand typical abbreviations, and mark special name entities (e.g., replace a URL by #LINK# and replace a monetary amount ?$78.99?",

        "Our domain-specific lexicon contains distinguishable aspects associated with sentiment words.",

        "?effici,?",
        "and so on).",
        "We notice that some positive words also occur on the negative side.",
        "This may be for two reasons.",
        "First, some sentences that contain positive words may convey a negative sentiment, such as ?The staff should be more efficient.?",
        "Second, the bootstrapping process in ReNew may introduce some wrong words by mistakenly labeling the sentiment of the segments.",

        "We first generate ten domain-specific lexicons by repeatedly following these steps: For the first iteration, (1) build a training dataset by randomly selecting 20 labeled reviews (about 220 segments) and (2) train the learners using the training dataset and LIWC.",

        "Like Re-New, Lazaridou et al.'s approach works on the sub sentential level.",
        "However, it differs from ReNew in three aspects.",
        "First, the basic units of their model are elementary discourse units (EDUs) from Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988).",
        "Second, their model considers the forward relationship between EDUs, whereas ReNew captures both forward and backward relationship between segments.",
        "Third, they use a generative model to capture the transition distributions over EDUs whereas ReNew uses a discriminative model to capture the transition sequences of segments.",
        "EDUs are defined as minimal units of text and consider many more relations than the two types 549 Table 5: Comparison of our framework with previous work on sentiment classification.",
        "Method Accuracy EDU-Model (Lazaridou et al.) 0.594 ReNew (our method) 0.605 of transition cues underlying our segments.",
        "We posit that EDUs are too fine-grained for sentiment analysis.",
        "Consider the following sentence from Lazaridou et al.'s dataset with its EDUs identified.",
        "(1) My husband called the front desk (2) to complain.",
        "Unfortunately, EDU (1) lacks sentiment and EDU (2) lacks the topic.",
        "Although Lazaridou et al.'s model can capture the forward relationship between any two consecutive EDUs, it cannot handle such cases because their model assumes that each EDU is associated with a topic and a sentiment.",
        "In contrast, ReNew finds just one segment in the above sentence.",
        "Just to compare with Lazaridou et al., we apply our sentiment labeling component at the level of EDUs.",
        "Their labeled dataset contains 65 re-views, corresponding to 1,541 EDUs.",
        "Since this dataset is also extracted from Tripadvisor, we use the domain-specific lexicon automatically learned by ReNew based on our 4,071 unlabeled reviews.",
        "Follow the same training and testing regimen (10- fold cross validation), we compare ReNew with their model.",
        "As shown in Table 5, ReNew outperforms their approach on their dataset: Although ReNew is not optimized for EDUs, it achieves better accuracy.",
        "5 Related Work Two bodies of work are relevant.",
        "First, to generate sentiment lexicons, existing approaches commonly generate a sentiment lexicon by extending dictionaries or sentiment lexicons.",
        "Hu and Liu (2004), manually collect a small set of sentiment words and expand it iteratively by searching synonyms and antonyms in WordNet (Miller, 1995).",
        "Rao and Ravichandran (2009) formalize the problem of sentiment detection as a semi-supervised label propagation problem in a graph.",
        "Each node represents a word, and a weighted edge between any two nodes indicates the strength of the relationship between them.",
        "Esuli and Sebas-tiani (2006) use a set of classifiers in a semi-supervised fashion to iteratively expand a manually defined lexicon.",
        "Their lexicon, named Senti-WordNet, comprises the synset of each word obtained from WordNet.",
        "Each synset is associated with three sentiment scores: positive, negative, and objective.",
        "Second, for sentiment classification, Nakagawa et al. (2010) introduce a probabilistic model that uses the interactions between words within one sentence for inferring sentiments.",
        "Socher et al. (2011) introduce a semi-supervised approach that uses recursive autoencoders to learn the hierarchical structure and sentiment distribution of a sentence.",
        "Jo and Oh (2011) propose a probabilistic generative model named ASUM that can extract aspects coupled with sentiments.",
        "Kim et al. (2013) extend ASUM by enabling its probabilistic model to discover a hierarchical structure of the aspect-based sentiments.",
        "The above works apply sentence-level sentiment classification and their models are not able to capture the relationships between or among clauses.",
        "6 Conclusions and Future Work The leading lexical approaches to sentiment analysis from text are based on fixed lexicons that are painstakingly built by hand.",
        "There is little a priori justification that such lexicons would port across application domains.",
        "In contrast, ReNew seeks to automate the building of domain-specific lexicons beginning from a general sentiment lexicon and the iterative application of CRFs.",
        "Our results are promising.",
        "ReNew greatly reduces the human effort for generating high-quality sentiment lexicons together with a classification model.",
        "In future work, we plan to apply ReNew to additional sentiment analysis problems such as review quality analysis and sentiment summarization.",
