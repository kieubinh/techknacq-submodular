        "Information Extraction (IE) aims at extracting syntactic or semantic units with concrete concepts or linguistic functions (Grishman, 2012; McCal-lum, 2005).",
        "Instead of dealing with the whole doc-uments, focusing on designated information, most of the IE systems extract named entities, relations, quantifiers or events from sentences.",
        "The relation recognition task is to find the relationships between two entities.",
        "Successful recognition of relation implies correctly detecting both the relation arguments and relation type.",
        "Although this task has received extensive research.",
        "The performance of relation extraction is still unsatisfactory with a F-score of 67.5% for English (23 sub-types) (Zhou et al., 2010).",
        "Chinese relation extraction also faces a weak performance having F-score about 66.6% in 18 subtypes (Dandan et al., 2012).",
        "The difficulty of Chinese IE is that Chinese words are written next to each other without delimiter in between.",
        "Lacking of orthographic word makes Chinese word segmentation difficult.",
        "In Chinese, a single sentence often has several segmentation paths leading to the segmentation ambiguity problem (Liang, 1984).",
        "The lack of delimiter also causes the Out-of-Vocabulary problem (OOV, also known as new word detection) (Huang and Zhao, 2007).",
        "These problems are worsened by the fact that Chinese has a large number of characters and words.",
        "Currently, the state-of-the-art Chinese OOV recognition system has performance about 75% in recall (Zhong et al., 2012).",
        "The errors caused by segmentation and OOV will accumulate and propagate to subsequent processing (e.g. part-of-speech (POS) tagging or parsing).",
        "Therefore, the Chinese relation extraction is more difficult.",
        "According to our survey, compared to the same work in English, the Chinese relation extraction researches make less significant progress.",
        "Based on the characteristics of Chinese, in this paper, an Omni-word feature and a soft constraint method are proposed for Chinese relation extraction.",
        "We apply these approaches in a maximum entropy based system to extract relations from the ACE 2005 corpus.",

        "Propose a novel Omni-word feature for Chinese relation extraction.",

        "The Omni-word feature and soft constrain are proposed in Section 3.",
        "We give the experimental results in Section 3.2 and analyze the performance in Section 4.",
        "Conclusions are given in Section 5.",
        "2 Related Work There are two paradigms extracting the relationship between two entities: the Open Relation Extraction (ORE) and the Traditional Relation Extraction (TRE) (Banko et al., 2008).",
        "Based on massive and heterogeneous corpora, the ORE systems deal with millions or billions of documents.",
        "Even strict filtrations or constrains are employed to filter the redundancy information, they often generate tens of thousands of relations dynamically (Hoffmann et al., 2010).",
        "The practicability of ORE systems depends on the adequateness of information in a big corpus (Brin, 1999).",
        "Most of the ORE systems utilize weak supervision knowledge to guide the extracting process, such as: Databases (Craven and Kumlien, 1999), Wikipedia (Wu and Weld, 2007; Hoffmann et al., 2010), Regular expression (Brin, 1999; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000), Ontology (Carlson et al., 2010; Mohamed et al., 2011) or Knowledge Base extracted automatically from Internet (Mintz et al., 2009; Takamatsu et al., 2012).",
        "However, when iteratively coping with large heterogeneous data, the ORE systems suffer from the ?semantic drift?",
        "problem, caused by error accumulation (Curran et al., 2007).",
        "Agichtein, Carlson and Fader et al. (2010; 2011; 2000) propose syntactic and semantic constraints to prevent this deficiency.",
        "The soft constraints, proposed in this paper, are combined features like these syntactic or semantic con-straints, which will be discussed in Section 3.2.",
        "The TRE paradigm takes hand-tagged examples as input, extracting predefined relation types (Banko et al., 2008).",
        "The TRE systems use techniques such as: Rules (Regulars, Patterns and Propositions) (Miller et al., 1998), Kernel method (Zhang et al., 2006b; Zelenko et al., 2003), Belief network (Roth and Yih, 2002), Linear programming (Roth and Yih, 2007), Maximum entropy (Kambhatla, 2004) or SVM (GuoDong et al., 2005).",
        "Compared to the ORE systems, the TRE systems have a robust performance.",
        "Disadvantages of the TRE systems are that the manually annotated corpus is required, which is time-consuming and costly in human labor.",
        "And migrating between different applications is difficult.",
        "However, the TRE systems are evaluable and comparable.",
        "Different systems running on the same corpus can be evaluated appropriately.",
        "In the field of Chinese relation extraction, Liu et al. (2012) proposed a convolution tree kernel.",
        "Combining with external semantic resources, a better performance was achieved.",
        "Che et al. (2005) introduced a feature based method, which utilized lexicon information around entities and was evaluated on Winnow and SVM classifiers.",
        "Li and Zhang et al. (2008; 2008) explored the position feature between two entities.",
        "For each type of these relations, a SVM was trained and tested independently.",
        "Based on Deep Belief Net-work, Chen et al. (2010) proposed a model handling the high dimensional feature space.",
        "In addi-tion, there are mixed models.",
        "For example, Lin et al. (2010) employed a model, combining both the feature based and the tree kernel based methods.",
        "Despite the popularity of kernel based method, Huang et al. (2008) experimented with different kernel methods and inferred that simply migrating from English kernel methods can result in a bad performance in Chinese relation extraction.",
        "Chen and Li et al. (2008; 2010) also pointed out that, due to the inaccuracy of Chinese word segmentation and parsing, the tree kernel based approach is inappropriate for Chinese relation extraction.",
        "The reason of the tree kernel based approach not achieve the same level of accuracy as that from English may be that segmenting and parsing Chinese are more difficult and less accurate than processing English.",
        "In our research, we proposed an Omni-word feature and a soft constraint method.",
        "Both approaches are based on the Chinese characteristics.",
        "Therefore, better performance is expected.",
        "In the following, we introduce the feature construction, which discusses the proposed two approaches.",
        "3 Feature Construction In this section, the employed candidate features are discussed.",
        "And four constraint conditions are proposed to transform the candidate features into combined features.",
        "The soft constraint is the 573 method to generate the combine features 1 .",

        "The extent mention includes both the head and its modifiers.",
        "Each relation has two entities as arguments: Arg-1 and Arg-2, referred to as E1 and E2.",
        "A relation mention (or instance) is the embodiment of a relation.",
        "It is referred by the sentence (or clause) in which the relation is located in.",

        "are supposed to be known and provided by the corpus.",
        "In our experiment, the entity type, subtype and the head noun are used.",
        "All the employed features are simply classified into five categories: Entity Type and Subtype, Head Noun, Position Feature, POS Tag and Omni-word Feature.",
        "The first four are widely used.",
        "The last one is proposed in this paper and is discussed in detail.",
        "Entity Type and Subtype: In ACE 2005 RDC Chinese corpus, there are 7 entity types (Person, Organization, GPE, Location, Facility, Weapon and Vehicle) and 44 subtypes (e.g. Group, Gov-ernment, Continent, etc.).",
        "Head Noun: The head noun (or head mention) of entity mention is manually annotated.",
        "This feature is useful and widely used.",
        "Position Feature: The position structure between two entity mentions (extend mentions).",
        "Because the entity mentions can be nested, two entity mentions may have four coarse structures: ?E1 is before E2?, ?E1 is after E2?, ?E1 nests in E2?",
        "and ?E2 nests in E1?, encoded as: ?E1_B_E2?, ?E1_A_E2?, ?E1_N_E2?",
        "and ?E2_N_E1?.",
        "POS Tag: In our model, we use only the adjacent entity POS tags, which lie in two sides of the entity mention.",
        "These POS tags are labelled by the ICTCLAS package 2 .",
        "The POS tags are not used independently.",
        "It is encoded by combining 1 If without ambiguity, we also use the terminology of ?soft constraint?",
        "denoting features generated by the employed constraint conditions.",
        "2 http://ictclas.org/ the POS tag with the adjacent entity mention information.",
        "For example ?E1_Right_n?",
        "means that the right side of the first entity is a noun (?n?).",
        "Omni-word Feature: The notion of ?word?",
        "in Chinese is vague and has never played a role in the Chinese philological tradition (Sproat et al., 1996).",
        "Some Chinese segmentation performance has been reported precision scores above 95% (Peng et al., 2004; Xue, 2003; Zhang et al., 2003).",
        "However, for the same sentence, even native peoples in China often disagree on word boundaries (Hoosain, 1992; Yan et al., 2010).",
        "Sproat et al. (1996) has showed that there is a consistence of 75% on the segmentation among different native Chinese speakers.",
        "The word-formation of Chinese also implies that the meanings of a compound word are made up, usually, by the meanings of words that contained in it (Hu and Du, 2012).",
        "So, fragments of phrase are also informative.",
        "Because high precision can be received by using simple lexical features (Kambhatla, 2004; Li et al., 2008).",
        "Making better use of such information is beneficial.",
        "In consideration of the Chinese char-acteristics, we use every potential word in a relation mention as the lexical features.",
        "For example, relation mention ??????????",
        "(Taipei Daan Forest Park) has a ?PART-WHOLE?",
        "relation type.",
        "The traditional segmentation method may generate four lexical features {???",
        "?, ???",
        "?, ??",
        "?",
        "?, ????",
        "}, which is a partition of the relation mention.",
        "On the other hand, the Omni-word feature denoting all the possible words in the relation mention may generate features as: {??",

        "?, ?????",
        "?, ????????",
        "}3 Most of these features are nested or overlapped mutually.",
        "So, the traditional character-based or word-based feature is only a subset of the Omni-word feature.",
        "To extract the Omni-word feature, only a lexicon is required, then scan the sentence to collect every word.",
        "Because the number of lexicon entry determines the dimension of the feature space, performance of Omni-word feature is influenced by the lexicon being employed.",
        "In this paper, we generate the lexicon by merging two lexicons.",
        "The first lexicon 3 The generated Omni-word features dependent on the employed lexicon.",
        "574 is obtained by segmenting every relation instance using the ICTCLAS package, collecting very word produced by ICTCLAS.",
        "Because the ICTCLAS package was trained on annotated corpus containing many meaningful lexicon entries.",
        "We expect this lexicon to improve the performance.",
        "The second lexicon is the Lexicon Common Words in Contemporary Chinese 4 .",
        "Despite the Omni-word can be seen as a subset of n-Gram feature.",
        "It is not the same as the n-Gram feature.",
        "N-Gram features are more fragmented.",
        "In most of the instances, the n-Gram features have no semantic meanings attached to them, thus have varied distributions.",
        "Furthermore, for a single Chinese word, occurrences of 4 characters are frequent.",
        "Even 7 or more characters are not rare.",
        "Because Chinese has plenty of characters 5 , when the corpus becoming larger, the n-Gram (n?4) method is difficult to be adopted.",
        "On the other hand, the Omni-word can avoid these problems and take advantages of Chinese characteristics (the word-formation and the ambiguity of word segmentation).",
        "3.2 Soft Constraint The structure information (or dependent informa-tion) of relation instance is critical for recognition.",
        "However, even in English, ?deeper?",
        "analysis (e.g. logical syntactic relations or predicate-argument structure) may suffer from a worse performance caused by inaccurate chunking or parsing.",
        "Hence, the local dependency contexts around the relation arguments are more helpful (Zhao and Gr-ishman, 2005).",
        "Zhang et al. (2006a) also showed that Path-enclosed Tree (PT) achieves the best performance in the kernel based relation extraction.",
        "In this field, the tree kernel based method commonly uses the parse tree to capture the structure information (Zelenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004).",
        "On the other hand, the feature based method usually uses the combined feature to capture such structure information (GuoDong et al., 2005; Kambhatla, 2004).",
        "In the open relation extraction domain, syntactic and semantic constraints are widely employed to prevent the ?semantic drift?",
        "problem.",
        "Such constraints can also be seen as structural constraint.",
        "4 Published by Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China in 2008, containing 56,008 entries.",
        "5 Currently, at least 13000 characters are used by native Chinese people.",
        "Modern Chinese Dictionary: http: //www.cp.com.cn/ Most of these constraints are hard constraints.",
        "Any relation instance violating these constraints (or below a predefined threshold) will be abandoned.",
        "For example, Agichtein and Gravano (2000) generates patterns according to a confidence threshold (?",
        "t ).",
        "Fader et al. (2011) utilizes a confidence function.",
        "And Carlson et al. (2010) filters candidate instances and patterns using the number of times they co-occurs.",
        "Deleting of relation instances is acceptable for open relation extraction because it always deals with a big data set.",
        "But it's not suitable for traditional relation extraction, and will result in a low recall.",
        "Utilizing the notion of combined feature (GuoDong et al., 2005; Kambhatla, 2004), we replace the hard constraint by the soft constraint.",
        "Each soft constraint (combined feature) has a parameter trained by the classifier indicating the discrimination ability it has.",
        "No subjective or priori judgement is adopted to delete any potential determinative constraint (except for the reason of dimensionality reduction).",
        "Most of the researches make use of the combined feature, but rarely analyze the influence of the approaches we combine them.",
        "In this paper, we use the soft constraint to model the local dependency.",
        "It is a subset of the combined feature, generated by four constraint conditions: singleton, position sensitive, bin sensitive and semantic pair .",
        "For every employed candidate feature, an appropriate constraint condition is selected to combine them with additional information to maximize the classification determination.",
        "Singleton: A feature is employed as a singleton feature when it is used without combining with any information.",
        "In our experiments, only the position feature is used as singleton feature.",
        "Position Sensitive: A position sensitive feature has a label indicating which entity mention it depends on.",

        "To use the Omni-word feature, we segment each relation mention by two entity mentions.",
        "Together with the two entity mentions, we get five parts: ?FIRST?, ?MID- DLE?, ?END?, ?E1?",
