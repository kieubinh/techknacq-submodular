        "Although the distributional hypothesis has been applied successfully in many natural language processing tasks, systems using distributional information have been limited to a single domain because the distribution of a word can vary between domains as the word's predominant meaning changes.",
        "However, if it were possible to predict how the distribution of a word changes from one domain to an-other, the predictions could be used to adapt a system trained in one domain to work in another.",
        "We propose an unsupervised method to predict the distribution of a word in one domain, given its distribution in another domain.",
        "We evaluate our method on two tasks: cross-domain part-of-speech tagging and cross-domain sentiment classification.",
        "In both tasks, our method significantly outperforms competitive baselines and returns results that are statistically comparable to current state-of-the-art methods, while requiring no task-specific customisations."

        "The Distributional Hypothesis, summarised by the memorable line of Firth (1957) ?",
        "You shall know a word by the company it keeps ?",
        "has inspired a diverse range of research in natural language processing.",
        "In such work, a word is represented by the distribution of other words that co-occur with it.",
        "Distributional representations of words have been successfully used in many language processing tasks such as entity set expansion (Pantel et al., 2009), part-of-speech (POS) tagging and chunking (Huang and Yates, 2009), ontology learning (Curran, 2005), computing semantic textual similarity (Besanc?on et al., 1999), and lexical inference (Kotlerman et al., 2012).",
        "However, the distribution of a word often varies from one domain 1 to another.",
        "For example, in the domain of portable computer reviews the word lightweight is often associated with positive sentiment bearing words such as sleek or compact, whereas in the movie review domain the same word is often associated with negative sentiment-bearing words such as superficial or formulaic.",
        "Consequently, the distributional representations of the word lightweight will differ considerably between the two domains.",
        "In this paper, given the distribution w S of a word w in the source domain S, we propose an unsupervised method for predicting its distributionw T in a different target domain T .",
        "The ability to predict how the distribution of a word varies from one domain to another is vital for numerous adaptation tasks.",
        "For example, unsupervised cross-domain sentiment classification (Blitzer et al., 2007; Aue and Gamon, 2005) involves using sentiment-labeled user reviews from the source domain, and unlabeled reviews from both the source and the target domains to learn a sentiment classifier for the target domain.",
        "Domain adaptation (DA) of sentiment classification becomes extremely challenging when the distributions of words in the source and the target domains are very different, because the features learnt from the source domain labeled reviews might not appear in the target domain reviews that must be classified.",
        "By predicting the distribution of a word across different domains, we can find source domain features that are similar to the features in target domain reviews, thereby reducing the mismatch of features between the two domains.",
        "We propose a two-step unsupervised approach to predict the distribution of a word across domains.",
        "First, we create two lower dimensional la-1 In this paper, we use the term domain to refer to a collection of documents about a particular topic, for example reviews of a particular kind of product.",
        "613 tent feature spaces separately for the source and the target domains using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).",
        "Second, we learn a mapping from the source domain latent feature space to the target domain latent feature space using Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR).",
        "The SVD smoothing in the first step both reduces the data sparseness in distributional representations of individual words, as well as the dimensionality of the feature space, thereby enabling us to efficiently and accurately learn a prediction model using PLSR in the second step.",
        "Our proposed cross-domain word distribution prediction method is unsupervised in the sense that it does not require any labeled data in either of the two steps.",
        "Using two popular multi-domain datasets, we evaluate the proposed method in two prediction tasks: (a) predicting the POS of a word in a target domain, and (b) predicting the sentiment of a review in a target domain.",
        "Without requiring any task specific customisations, systems based on our distribution prediction method significantly outperform competitive baselines in both tasks.",
        "Because our proposed distribution prediction method is unsupervised and task independent, it is potentially useful for a wide range of DA tasks such entity extraction (Guo et al., 2009) or dependency parsing (McClosky et al., 2010).",
        "Our contributions are summarised as follows: ?",
        "Given the distribution w S of a word w in a source domain S, we propose a method for learning its distribution w T in a target domain T .",
        "?",
        "Using the learnt distribution prediction model, we propose a method to learn a cross-domain POS tagger.",
        "?",
        "Using the learnt distribution prediction model, we propose a method to learn a cross-domain sentiment classifier.",
        "To our knowledge, ours is the first successful attempt to learn a model that predicts the distribution of a word across different domains.",
        "2 Related Work Learning semantic representations for words using documents from a single domain has received much attention lately (Vincent et al., 2010; Socher et al., 2013; Baroni and Lenci, 2010).",
        "As we have already discussed, the semantics of a word varies across different domains, and such variations are not captured by models that only learn a single semantic representation for a word using documents from a single domain.",
        "The POS of a word is influenced both by its context (contextual bias), and the domain of the document in which it appears (lexical bias).",
        "For example, the word signal is predominately used as a noun in MEDLINE, whereas it appears predominantly as an adjective in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) (Blitzer et al., 2006).",
        "Consequently, a tagger trained on WSJ would incorrectly tag signal in MEDLINE.",
        "Blitzer et al. (2006) append the source domain labeled data with predicted pivots (i.e. words that appear in both the source and target domains) to adapt a POS tagger to a target domain.",
        "Choi and Palmer (2012) propose a cross-domain POS tagging method by training two separate models: a generalised model and a domain-specific model.",
        "At tagging time, a sentence is tagged by the model that is most similar to that sentence.",
        "Huang and Yates (2009) train a Conditional Random Field (CRF) tagger with features retrieved from a smoothing model trained using both source and target domain unlabeled data.",
        "Adding latent states to the smoothing model further improves the POS tagging accuracy (Huang and Yates, 2012).",
        "Schnabel and Sch?utze (2013) propose a training set filtering method where they eliminate shorter words from the training data based on the intuition that longer words are more likely to be examples of productive linguistic processes than shorter words.",
        "The sentiment of a word can vary from one domain to another.",
        "In Structural Correspondence Learning (SCL) (Blitzer et al., 2006; Blitzer et al., 2007), a set of pivots are chosen using point-wise mutual information.",
        "Linear predictors are then learnt to predict the occurrence of those piv-ots, and SVD is used to construct a lower dimensional representation in which a binary classifier is trained.",
        "Spectral Feature Alignment (SFA) (Pan et al., 2010) also uses pivots to compute an alignment between domain specific and domain independent features.",
        "Spectral clustering is performed on a bipartite graph representing domain specific and domain independent features to find a lower-dimensional projection between the two sets of features.",
        "The cross-domain sentiment-sensitive thesaurus (SST) (Bollegala et al., 2011) groups together words that express similar sentiments in 614 different domains.",
        "The created thesaurus is used to expand feature vectors during train and test stages in a binary classifier.",
        "However, unlike our method, SCL, SFA, or SST do not learn a prediction model between word distributions across domains.",
        "Prior knowledge of the sentiment of words, such as sentiment lexicons, has been incorporated into cross-domain sentiment classification.",
        "He et al. (2011) propose a joint sentiment-topic model that imposes a sentiment-prior depending on the occurrence of a word in a sentiment lexicon.",
        "Pono-mareva and Thelwall (2012) represent source and target domain reviews as nodes in a graph and apply a label propagation algorithm to predict the sentiment labels for target domain reviews from the sentiment labels in source domain reviews.",
        "A sentiment lexicon is used to create features for a document.",
        "Although incorporation of prior sentiment knowledge is a promising technique to improve accuracy in cross-domain sentiment classi-fication, it is complementary to our task of distribution prediction across domains.",
        "The unsupervised DA setting that we consider does not assume the availability of labeled data for the target domain.",
        "However, if a small amount of labeled data is available for the target domain, it can be used to further improve the performance of DA tasks (Xiao et al., 2013; Daum?e III, 2007).",
        "3 Distribution Prediction 3.1 In-domain Feature Vector Construction Before we tackle the problem of learning a model to predict the distribution of a word across do-mains, we must first compute the distribution of a word from a single domain.",
        "For this purpose, we represent a word w using unigrams and bigrams that co-occur with w in a sentence as follows.",
        "Given a document H, such as a user-review of a product, we split H into sentences, and lemma-tize each word in a sentence using the RASP system (Briscoe et al., 2006).",
        "Using a standard stop word list, we filter out frequent non-content unigrams and select the remainder as unigram features to represent a sentence.",
        "Next, we generate bigrams of word lemmas and remove any bigrams that consists only of stop words.",
        "Bigram features capture negations more accurately than unigrams, and have been found to be useful for sentiment classification tasks.",
        "Table 1 shows the unigram and bigram features we extract for a sentence using this procedure.",
        "Using data from a single do-sentence This is an interesting and well researched book unigrams this, is, an, interesting, and, well, researched, (surface) book unigrams this, be, an, interest, and, well, research, book (lemma) unigrams interest, well, research, book (features) bigrams this+be, be+an, an+interest, interest+and, (lemma) and+well, well+research, research+book bigrams an+interest, interest+and, and+well, (features) well+research, research+book Table 1: Extracting unigram and bigram features.",
        "main, we construct a feature co-occurrence matrix A in which columns correspond to unigram features and rows correspond to either unigram or bigram features.",
        "The value of the element a ij in the co-occurrence matrix A is set to the number of sentences in which the i-th and j-th features co-occur.",
        "Typically, the number of unique bigrams is much larger than that of unigrams.",
        "Moreover, co-occurrences of bigrams are rare compared to co-occurrences of unigrams, and co-occurrences involving a unigram and a bigram.",
        "Consequently, in matrix A, we consider co-occurrences only between unigrams vs. unigrams, and bigrams vs. unigrams.",
        "We consider each row in A as representing the distribution of a feature (i.e. unigrams or bigrams) in a particular domain over the unigram features extracted from that domain (repre- sented by the columns of A).",
        "We apply Positive Pointwise Mutual Information (PPMI) to the co-occurrence matrix A.",
        "This is a variation of the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) (Church and Hanks, 1990), in which all PMI values that are less than zero are replaced with zero (Lin, 1998; Bul-linaria and Levy, 2007).",
        "Let F be the matrix that results when PPMI is applied to A. Matrix F has the same number of rows, n r , and columns, n c , as the raw co-occurrence matrix A.",
        "Note that in addition to the above-mentioned representation, there are many other ways to represent the distribution of a word in a particular domain (Turney and Pantel, 2010).",
        "For example, one can limit the definition of co-occurrence to words that are linked by some dependency relation (Padó and Lapata, 2007), or extend the window of co-occurrence to the entire document (Baroni and Lenci, 2010).",
        "Since the method we propose in Section 3.2 to predict the distribution of a word across domains does not depend on the particular 615 feature representation method, any of these alternative methods could be used.",
        "To reduce the dimensionality of the feature space, and create dense representations for words, we perform SVD on F. We use the left singular vectors corresponding to the k largest singular values to compute a rank k approximation ?",
        "F, of F. We perform truncated SVD using SVDLIBC 2 .",
        "Each row in ?",
        "F is considered as representing a word in a lower k ( n c ) dimensional feature space corresponding to a particular domain.",
        "Distribution prediction in this lower dimensional feature space is preferrable to prediction over the original feature space because there are reductions in overfit-ting, feature sparseness, and the learning time.",

        "In the literature, such features are often referred to as pivots, and they have been shown to be useful for DA, allowing the weights learnt to be transferred from one domain to another.",
        "Various criteria have been proposed for selecting a small set of pivots for DA, such as the mutual information of a word with the two domains (Blitzer et al., 2007).",
        "However, we do not impose any further restrictions on the set of pivots W other than that they occur in both domains.",
