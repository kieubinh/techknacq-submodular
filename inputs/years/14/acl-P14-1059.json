        "Distributional methods for semantics approximate the meaning of linguistic expressions with vectors that summarize the contexts in which they occur in large samples of text.",
        "This has been a very successful approach to lexical semantics (Erk, 2012), where semantic relatedness is assessed by comparing vectors.",
        "Recently these methods have been extended to phrases and sentences by means of composition operations (see Baroni (2013) for an overview).",
        "For example, given the vectors representing red and car, composition derives a vector that approximates the meaning of red car.",
        "However, the link between language and meaning is, obviously, bidirectional: As message recipients we are exposed to a linguistic expression and we must compute its meaning (the synthesis prob-lem).",
        "As message producers we start from the meaning we want to communicate (a ?thought?)",
        "and we must encode it into a word sequence (the generation problem).",
        "If distributional semantics is to be considered a proper semantic theory, then it must deal not only with synthesis (going from words to vectors), but also with generation (from vectors to words).",
        "Besides these theoretical considerations, phrase generation from vectors has many useful applications.",
        "We can, for example, synthesize the vector representing the meaning of a phrase or sentence, and then generate alternative phrases or sentences from this vector to accomplish true paraphrase generation (as opposed to paraphrase detection or ranking of candidate paraphrases).",
        "Generation can be even more useful when the source vector comes from another modality or language.",
        "Recent work on grounding language in vision shows that it is possible to represent images and linguistic expressions in a common vector-based semantic space (Frome et al., 2013; Socher et al., 2013).",
        "Given a vector representing an im-age, generation can be used to productively construct phrases or sentences that describe the image (as opposed to simply retrieving an existing description from a set of candidates).",
        "Translation is another potential application of the generation framework: Given a semantic space shared between two or more languages, one can compose a word sequence in one language and generate translations in another, with the shared semantic vector space functioning as interlingua.",
        "Distributional semantics assumes a lexicon of atomic expressions (that, for simplicity, we take to be words), each associated to a vector.",
        "Thus, at the single-word level, the problem of generation is solved by a trivial generation-by-synthesis approach: Given an arbitrary target vector, ?gener- ate?",
        "the corresponding word by searching through the lexicon for the word with the closest vector to the target.",
        "This is however unfeasible for larger expressions: Given n vocabulary elements, this approach requires checking n k phrases of length k. This becomes prohibitive already for relatively short phrases, as reasonably-sized vocabularies do not go below tens of thousands of words.",
        "The search space for 3-word phrases in a 10K-word vocabulary is already in the order of trillions.",
        "In 624 this paper, we introduce a more direct approach to phrase generation, inspired by the work in compositional distributional semantics.",
        "In short, we revert the composition process and we propose a framework of data-induced, syntax-dependent functions that decompose a single vector into a vector sequence.",
        "The generated vectors can then be efficiently matched against those in the lexicon or fed to the decomposition system again to produce longer phrases recursively.",
        "2 Related work To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explicitly and systematically pursue the generation problem in distributional semantics.",
        "Kalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013) use top-level, composed distributed representations of sentences to guide generation in a machine translation setting.",
        "More pre-cisely, they condition the target language model on the composed representation (addition of word vectors) of the source language sentence.",
        "Andreas and Ghahramani (2013) discuss the the issue of generating language from vectors and present a probabilistic generative model for distributional vectors.",
        "However, their emphasis is on reversing the generative story in order to derive composed meaning representations from word sequences.",
        "The theoretical generating capabilities of the methods they propose are briefly exemplified, but not fully explored or tested.",
        "Socher et al. (2011) come closest to our target problem.",
        "They introduce a bidirectional language-to-meaning model for compositional distributional semantics that is similar in spirit to ours.",
        "How-ever, we present a clearer decoupling of synthesis and generation and we use different (and simpler) training methods and objective functions.",
        "More-over, Socher and colleagues do not train separate decomposition rules for different syntactic config-urations, so it is not clear how they would be able to control the generation of different output structures.",
        "Finally, the potential for generation is only addressed in passing, by presenting a few cases where the generated sequence has the same syntactic structure of the input sequence.",
        "3 General framework We start by presenting the familiar synthesis set-ting, focusing on two-word phrases.",
        "We then introduce generation for the same structures.",
        "Fi-nally, we show how synthesis and generation of longer phrases is handled by recursive extension of the two-word case.",
        "We assume a lexicon L, that is, a bi-directional look-up table containing a list of words L w linked to a matrix L v of vectors.",
        "Both synthesis and generation involve a trivial lexicon look-up step to retrieve vectors associated to words and vice versa: We ignore it in the exposition below.",
        "3.1 Synthesis To construct the vector representing a two-word phrase, we must compose the vectors associated to the input words.",
        "More formally, similarly to Mitchell and Lapata (2008), we define a syntax-dependent composition function yielding a phrase vector ~p: ~p = f comp R (~u,~v) where ~u and ~v are the vector representations associated to words u and v. f comp R : R d ?",
        "R d ?",
        "R d (for d the dimensionality of vectors) is a composition function specific to the syntactic relation R holding between the two words.",
        "1 Although we are not bound to a specific composition model, throughout this paper we use the method proposed by Guevara (2010) and Zanzotto et al. (2010) which defines composition as application of linear transformations to the two constituents followed by summing the resulting vec-tors: f comp R (~u,~v) = W 1 ~u+W 2 ~v.",
        "We will further use the following equivalent formulation: f comp R (~u,~v) = W R [~u;~v] where W R ?",
        "R d?2d and [~u;~v] is the vertical concatenation of the two vectors (using Matlab no-tation).",
        "Following Guevara, we learn W R using examples of word and phrase vectors directly extracted from the corpus (for the rest of the pa-per, we refer to these phrase vectors extracted non-compositionally from the corpus as observed vectors).",
        "To estimate, for example, the weights in the W AN (adjective-noun) matrix, we use the corpus-extracted vectors of the words in tuples such as ?red, car, red.car?, ?evil, cat, evil.cat?, etc.",
        "Given a set of training examples stacked into matrices U , V (the constituent vectors) and P (the corresponding observed vectors), we estimate W R by solving the least-squares regression problem: 1 Here we make the simplifying assumption that all vectors have the same dimensionality, however this need not necessarily be the case.",
        "625 min W R ?R d?2d ?P ?W R [U ;V ]?",
        "(1) We use the approximation of observed phrase vectors as objective because these vectors can provide direct evidence of the polysemous behaviour of words: For example, the corpus-observed vectors of green jacket and green politician reflect how the meaning of green is affected by its occurrence with different nouns.",
        "Moreover, it has been shown that for two-word phrases, despite their relatively low frequency, such corpus-observed representations are still difficult to outperform in phrase similarity tasks (Dinu et al., 2013; Turney, 2012).",
        "3.2 Generation Generation of a two-word sequence from a vector proceeds in two steps: decomposition of the phrase vectors into two constituent vectors, and search for the nearest neighbours of each constituent vector in L v (the lexical matrix) in order to retrieve the corresponding words from L w .",
        "Decomposition We define a syntax-dependent decomposition function: [~u;~v] = f decomp R (~p) where ~p is a phrase vector, ~u and ~v are vectors associated to words standing in the syntactic relation R and f decomp R : R d ?",
        "R d ?",
        "R d .",
        "We assume that decomposition is also a linear transformation, W ?",
        "R ?",
        "R 2d?d , which, given an input phrase vector, returns two constituent vectors: f decomp R (~p) = W ?",
        "R ~p Again, we can learn from corpus-observed vectors associated to tuples of word pairs and the corresponding phrases by solving: min W ?",
        "R ?R 2d?d ?",
        "[U ;V ]?W ?",
        "R P?",
        "(2) If a composition function f comp R is available, an alternative is to learn a function that can best revert this composition.",
        "The decomposition function is then trained as follows: min W ?",
        "R ?R 2d?d ?",
        "[U ;V ]?W ?",
        "R W R [U ;V ]?",
        "(3) where the matrix W R is a given composition function for the same relation R. Training with observed phrases, as in eq. (2), should be better at capturing the idiosyncrasies of the actual distribution of phrases in the corpus and it is more robust by being independent from the availability and quality of composition functions.",
        "On the other hand, if the goal is to revert as faithfully as possible the composition process and retrieve the original constituents (e.g., in a different modality or a different language), then the objective in eq. (3) is more motivated.",
        "Nearest neighbour search We retrieve the nearest neighbours of each constituent vector ~u obtained by decomposition by applying a search function s: NN ~u = s(~u, L v , t) where NN ~u is a list containing the t nearest neighours of ~u from L v , the lexical vectors.",
        "Depending on the task, t might be set to 1 to retrieve just one word sequence, or to larger values to retrieve t alternatives.",
        "The similarity measure used to determine the nearest neighbours is another parameter of the search function; we omit it here as we only experiment with the standard cosine measure (Turney and Pantel, 2010).",
        "2 3.3 Recursive (de)composition Extension to longer sequences is straightforward if we assume binary tree representations as syntactic structures.",
        "In synthesis, the top-level vector can be obtained by applying composition functions recursively.",
        "For example, the vector of big red car would be obtained as: f comp AN ( ~ big, f comp AN ( ~ red, ~car)), where f comp AN is the composition function for adjective-noun phrase combinations.",
        "Conversely, for generation, we decompose the phrase vector with f decomp AN .",
        "The first vector is used for retrieving the nearest adjective from the lexicon, while the second vector is further decomposed.",
        "In the experiments in this paper we assume that the syntactic structure is given.",
        "In Section 7, we discuss ways to eliminate this assumption.",
        "2 Note that in terms of computational efficiency, cosine-based nearest neighbour searches reduce to vector-matrix multiplications, for which many efficient implementations exist.",
        "Methods such as locality sensitive hashing can be used for further speedups when working with particularly large vocabularies (Andoni and Indyk, 2008).",
        "626 4 Evaluation setting In our empirical part, we focus on noun phrase generation.",
        "A noun phrase can be a single noun or a noun with one or more modifiers, where a modifier can be an adjective or a prepositional phrase.",
        "A prepositional phrase is in turn composed of a preposition and a noun phrase.",
        "We learn two composition (and corresponding decomposition) func-tions: one for modifier-noun phrases, trained on adjective-noun (AN) pairs, and a second one for prepositional phrases, trained on preposition-noun (PN) combinations.",
        "For the rest of this section we describe the construction of the vector spaces and the (de)composition function learning procedure.",
        "Construction of vector spaces We test two types of vector representations.",
        "The cbow model introduced in Mikolov et al. (2013a) learns vector representations using a neural network architecture by trying to predict a target word given the words surrounding it.",
        "We use the word2vec software 3 to build vectors of size 300 and using a context window of 5 words to either side of the target.",
        "We set the sub-sampling option to 1e-05 and estimate the probability of a target word with the negative sampling method, drawing 10 samples from the noise distribution (see Mikolov et al. (2013a) for details).",
        "We also implement a standard count-based bag-of-words distributional space (Turney and Pantel, 2010) which counts occurrences of a target word with other words within a symmetric window of size 5.",
        "We build a 300Kx300K symmetric co-occurrence matrix using the top most frequent words in our source corpus, apply positive PMI weighting and Singular Value Decomposition to reduce the space to 300 dimensions.",
        "For both spaces, the vectors are finally normalized to unit length.",
        "4 For both types of vectors we use 2.8 billion tokens as input (ukWaC + Wikipedia + BNC).",
        "The Italian language vectors for the cross-lingual experiments of Section 6 were trained on 1.6 billion tokens from itWaC.",
        "5 A word token is a word-form + POS-tag string.",
        "We extract both word vectors and the observed phrase vectors which are 3 Available at https://code.google.com/p/ word2vec/ 4 The parameters of both models have been chosen without specific tuning, based on their observed stable performance in previous independent experiments.",
        "5 Corpus sources: http://wacky.sslmit.unibo.",
        "it, http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk required for the training procedures.",
        "We sanity-check the two spaces on MEN (Bruni et al., 2012), a 3,000 items word similarity data set.",
        "cbow significantly outperforms count (0.80 vs. 0.72 Spearman correlations with human judgments).",
        "count performance is consistent with previously reported results.",
        "6 (De)composition function training The training data sets consist of the 50K most frequent ?u, v, p?",
        "tuples for each phrase type, for example, ?red, car, red.car?",
        "or ?in, car, in.car?.",
        "7 We concatenate ~u and ~v vectors to obtain the [U ;V ] matrix and we use the observed ~p vectors (e.g., the corpus vector of the red.car bigram) to obtain the phrase matrix P .",
        "We use these data sets to solve the least squares regression problems in eqs.",
        "(1) and (2), obtaining estimates of the composition and decomposition matrices, respectively.",
        "For the decomposition function in eq. (3), we replace the observed phrase vectors with those composed with f comp R (~u,~v), where f comp R is the previously estimated composition function for relation R. Composition function performance Since the experiments below also use composed vectors as input to the generation process, it is important to provide independent evidence that the composition model is of high quality.",
        "This is indeed the case: We tested our composition approach on the task of retrieving observed AN and PN vectors, based on their composed vectors (similarly to Baroni and Zamparelli (2010), we want to retrieve the observed red.car vector using f comp AN (red, car)).",
        "We obtain excellent results, with minimum accuracy of 0.23 (chance level <0.0001).",
        "We also test on the AN-N paraphrasing test set used in Dinu et al. (2013) (in turn adapting Turney (2012)).",
        "The dataset contains 620 ANs, each paired with a single-noun paraphrase (e.g., false belief/fallacy, personal appeal/charisma).",
        "The task is to rank all nouns in the lexicon by their similarity to the phrase, and return the rank of the correct paraphrase.",
        "Results are reported in the first row of Table 1.",
        "To facilitate comparison, we search, like Dinu et al., through a vocabulary containing the 20K most frequent nouns.",
        "The count vectors results are similar to those reported by Dinu and colleagues for the same model, and with cbow vec-6 See Baroni et al. (2014) for an extensive comparison of the two types of vector representations.",
        "7 For PNs, we ignore determiners and we collapse, for ex-ample, in.the.car and in.car occurrences.",
        "627 Input Output cbow count A?N N 11 171 N A, N 67,29 204,168 Table 1: Median rank on the AN-N set of Dinu et al. (2013) (e.g., personal appeal/charisma).",
        "First row: the A and N are composed and the closest N is returned as a paraphrase.",
        "Second row: the N vector is decomposed into A and N vectors and their nearest (POS-tag consistent) neighbours are returned.",
        "tors we obtain a median rank that is considerably higher than that of the methods they test.",
        "5 Noun phrase generation 5.1 One-step decomposition We start with testing one-step decomposition by generating two-word phrases.",
        "A first straightforward evaluation consists in decomposing a phrase vector into the correct constituent words.",
        "For this purpose, we randomly select (and consequently re-move) from the training sets 200 phrases of each type (AN and PN) and apply decomposition operations to 1) their corpus-observed vectors and 2) their composed representations.",
        "We generate two words by returning the nearest neighbours (with appropriate POS tags) of the two vectors produced by the decomposition functions.",
        "Table 2 reports generation accuracy, i.e., the proportion of times in which we retrieved the correct constituents.",
        "The search space consists of the top most frequent 20K nouns, 20K adjectives and 25 prepositions respectively, leading to chance accuracy <0.0001 for nouns and adjectives and <0.05 for prepositions.",
        "We obtain relatively high accuracy, with cbow vectors consistently outperforming count ones.",
        "Decomposing composed rather than observed phrase representations is eas-ier, which is to be expected given that composed representations are obtained with a simpler, linear model.",
        "Most of the errors consist in generating synonyms (hard case?difficult case, true cost ?",
        "actual cost) or related phrases (stereo speak-ers?omni-directional sound).",
        "Next, we use the AN-N dataset of Dinu and colleagues for a more interesting evaluation of one-step decomposition.",
        "In particular, we reverse the original paraphrasing direction by attempting to generate, for example, personal charm from charisma.",
        "It is worth stressing the nature of the Input Output cbow count A.N A, N 0.36,0.61 0.20,0.41 P.N P, N 0.93,0.79 0.60,0.57 A?N A, N 1.00,1.00 0.86,0.99 P?N P, N 1.00,1.00 1.00,1.00 Table 2: Accuracy of generation models at retrieving (at rank 1) the constituent words of adjective-noun (AN) and preposition-noun (PN) phrases.",
        "Observed (A.N) and composed representations (A?N) are decomposed with observed-(eq. 2) and composed-trained (eq. 3) functions respectively.",
        "paraphrase-by-generation task we tackle here and in the next experiments.",
        "Compositional distributional semantic systems are often evaluated on phrase and sentence paraphrasing data sets (Bla- coe and Lapata, 2012; Mitchell and Lapata, 2010; Socher et al., 2011; Turney, 2012).",
        "However, these experiments assume a pre-compiled list of candidate paraphrases, and the task is to rank correct paraphrases above foils (paraphrase rank-ing) or to decide, for a given pair, if the two phrases/sentences are mutual paraphrases (para- phrase detection).",
        "Here, instead, we do not assume a given set of candidates: For example, in N?AN paraphrasing, any of 20K 2 possible combinations of adjectives and nouns from the lexicon could be generated.",
        "This is a much more challenging task and it paves the way to more realistic applications of distributional semantics in generation scenarios.",
        "The median ranks of the gold A and N of the Dinu set are shown in the second row of Table 1.",
        "As the top-generated noun is almost always, uninterestingly, the input one, we return the next noun.",
        "Here we report results for the more motivated corpus-observed training of eq. (2) (unsur- prisingly, using composed-phrase training for the task of decomposing single nouns leads to lower performance).",
        "Although considerably more difficult than the previous task, the results are still very good, with median ranks under 100 for the cbow vectors (ran- dom median rank at 10K).",

        "We observe moreover that sometimes the decomposition reflects selectional preference effects, by generating adjectives that denote typical properties of the noun to be paraphrased (e.g., animosity is a (po- litical, personal,...) hostility or a fridge is a (big, large, small,...) refrigerator).",
        "This effect could be exploited for tasks such as property-based concept description (Kelly et al., 2012).",

        "For observed phrase vector training, accuracy and rank are well above chance for all constituents (random accuracy 0.00005 for nouns and 0.04 for prepositions, corresponding median ranks: 10K, 12).",
        "Preposition generation is clearly a more difficult task.",
        "This is due at least in part to their highly ambiguous and broad semantics, and the way in which they interact with the nouns.",

        "However, they resort to scoring phrase pairs extracted from an aligned parallel corpus, as they do not have a method to freely generate these.",
        "Similarly, in the recent work on common vector spaces for the representation of images and text, the current emphasis is on retrieving existing captions (Socher et al., 2014) and not actual generation of image descriptions.",
        "From a more theoretical point of view, our work fills an important gap in distributional semantics, making it a bidirectional theory of the connection between language and meaning.",
        "We can now translate linguistic strings into vector ?thoughts?, and the latter into their most appropriate linguistic expression.",
        "Several neuroscientific studies suggest that thoughts are represented in the brain by patterns of activation over broad neural areas, and vectors are a natural way to encode such patterns (Haxby et al., 2001; Huth et al., 2012).",
