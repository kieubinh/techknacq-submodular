        "Multi-word expressions (MWEs) constitute a large part of the lexicon and account for much of its growth (Jackendoff, 2002; Seaton and Macaulay, 2002).",
        "However, despite their impor-tance, MWEs remain difficult to define and model, and consequently pose serious difficulties for NLP applications (Sag et al., 2001).",
        "Multi-word Predicates (MWPs; sometimes termed Complex Predi-cates) form an important and much addressed subclass of MWEs and are the focus of this paper.",
        "MWPs are informally defined as multiple words that constitute a single predicate (Alsina et al., 1997).",
        "MWPs encompass a wide range of phe-nomena, including causatives, light verbs, phrasal verbs, serial verb constructions and many others, and pose considerable challenges to both linguistic theory and NLP applications (see Section 2).",
        "Part of the difficulty in treating them stems from their position on the borderline between syntax and the lexicon.",
        "It is therefore often unclear whether they should be treated as fixed expressions, as compositional phrases that reflect the properties of their component parts or as both.",
        "This work addresses the modelling of MWPs within the context of distributional semantics (Tur- ney and Pantel, 2010), in which predicates are represented through the distribution of arguments they may take.",
        "In order to collect meaningful statistics, the predicate's lexical unit should be sufficiently frequent and semantically unambiguous.",
        "MWPs pose a challenge to such models, as na?",
        "?vely collecting statistics over all instances of highly ambiguous verbs is likely to result in noisy representations.",
        "For instance, the verb ?take?",
        "may appear in MWPs as varied as ?take time?, ?take effect?",
        "and ?take to the hills?.",
        "This heterogeneity of ?take?",
        "is likely to have a negative effect on downstream systems that use its distributional representation.",
        "For instance, while ?take?",
        "and ?ac- cept?",
        "are often considered lexically similar, the high frequency in which ?take?",
        "participates in non-compositional MWPs is likely to push the two verbs?",
        "distributional representations apart.",
        "A straightforward approach to this problem is to represent the predicate as a conjunction of multiple words, thereby trading ambiguity for sparsity.",
        "For instance, the verb ?take?",
        "could be conjoined with its object (e.g., ?take care?, ?take a bus?).",
        "This approach, however, raises the challenge of identifying the sub-set of the predicate's words that should be taken to represent it (hence- forth, its lexical components or LCs).",
        "We propose a novel approach that addresses this 644 challenge in the context of identifying lexical inference relations between predicates (Lin and Pan-tel, 2001; Schoenmackers et al., 2010; Melamud et al., 2013a, inter alia).",
        "A (lexical) inference relation p L ?",
        "p R is said to hold if the relation denoted by p R generally holds between a set of arguments whenever the relation p L does.",
        "For instance, an inference relation holds between ?annex?",
        "and ?con- trol?",
        "since if a country annexes another, it generally controls it.",
        "Most works to this task use distributional similarity, either as their main component (Szpektor and Dagan, 2008; Melamud et al., 2013b), or as part of a more comprehensive system (Berant et al., 2011; Lewis and Steedman, 2013).",
        "For example, consider the verb ?take?.",
        "While the inference relation ?have?",
        "take?",
        "does not generally hold, it does hold in the case of some light verbs, such as ?have a look?",
        "take a look?, underscoring the importance of taking more inclusive LCs into account.",
        "On the other hand, the predicate ?likely to give a green light?",
        "is unlikely to appear often even within a very large corpus, and could benefit from taking its lexical sub-units (e.g., ?likely?",
        "or ?give a green light?)",
        "into account.",
        "We present a novel approach to the task that models the selection and relative weighting of the predicate's LCs using latent variables.",
        "This approach allows the classifier that uses the distributional representations to take into account the most relevant LCs in order to make the prediction.",
        "By doing so, we avoid the notoriously difficult problem of defining and identifying MWPs and account for predicates of various sizes and degrees of compositionality.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first work to address lexical relations between MWPs of varying degrees of compositionality within distributional semantics.",
        "We conduct experiments on the dataset of Zeichner et al. (2012) and compare our methods with analogous ones that select a fixed LC, using state-of-the-art feature sets.",
        "Our method obtains substantial performance gains across all scenarios.",
        "Finally, we note that our approach is cognitively appealing.",
        "Significant cognitive findings support the claim that a speaker's lexicon consists of partially overlapping lexical units of various sizes, of which several can be evoked in the interpretation of an utterance (Jackendoff, 2002; Wray, 2008).",
        "2 Background and Related Work Inference Relations.",
        "The detection of inference relations between predicates has become a central task over the past few years (Sekine, 2005; Zan-zotto et al., 2006; Schoenmackers et al., 2010; Berant et al., 2011; Melamud et al., 2013a, inter alia).",
        "Inference rules are used in a wide variety of applications including Question Answering (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002), Information Extraction (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006), and as a main component in Textual Entailment systems (Dinu and Wang, 2009; Dagan et al., 2013).",
        "Most approaches to the task used distributional similarity as a major component within their system.",
        "Lin and Pantel (2001) introduced DIRT, an unsupervised distributional system for detecting inference relations.",
        "The system is still considered a state-of-the-art baseline (Melamud et al., 2013a), and is often used as a component within larger systems.",
        "Schoenmackers et al. (2010) presented an unsupervised system for learning inference rules directly from open-domain web data.",
        "Melamud et al. (2013a) used topic models to combine type-level predicate inference rules with token-level information from their arguments in a specific context.",
        "Melamud et al. (2013b) used lexical expansion to improve the representation of infrequent predicates.",
        "Lewis and Steedman (2013) combined distributional and symbolic representations, evaluating on a Question Answering task, as well as on a quantification-focused entailment dataset.",
        "Several studies tackled the task using supervised systems.",
        "Weisman et al. (2012) used a set of linguistically motivated features, but evaluated their system on a corpus that consists almost entirely of single-word predicates.",
        "Mirkin et al. (2006) presented a system for learning inference rules between nouns, using distributional similarity and pattern-based features.",
        "Hagiwara et al. (2009) identified synonyms using a supervised approach relying on distributional and syntactic features.",
        "Berant et al. (2011) used distributional similarity between predicates to weight the edges of an entailment graph.",
        "By imposing global constraints on the structure of the graph, they obtained a more accurate set of inference rules.",
        "Previous work used simple methods to select the predicate's LC.",
        "Some filtered out frequent highly ambiguous verbs (Lewis and Steedman, 2013), others selected a single representative word (Melamud et al., 2013a), while yet others used multi-word LCs but treated them as fixed expressions (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Berant et al., 2011).",
        "The goals of the above studies are largely com-645 plementary to ours.",
        "While previous work focused either on improving the quality of the distributional representations themselves or on their incorporation into more elaborate systems, we focus on the integration of the distributional representation of multiple LCs to improve the identification of inference relations between MWPs.",
        "MWP Extraction and Identification.",
        "MWPs have received considerable attention over the years in both theoretical and applicative contexts.",
        "Their position on the crossroads of syntax and the lexi-con, their varying degrees of compositionality, as well as the wealth of linguistic phenomena they exhibit, made them the object of ongoing linguistic discussion (Alsina et al., 1997; Butt, 2010).",
        "In NLP, the discovery and identification of MWEs in general and MWPs in particular has been the focus of much work over the years (Lin, 1999; Baldwin et al., 2003; Biemann and Giesbrecht, 2011).",
        "Despite wide interest, the field has yet to converge to a general and widely agreed-upon method for identifying MWPs.",
        "See (Ramisch et al., 2013) for an overview.",
        "Most work on MWEs emphasized idiosyncratic or non-compositional expressions.",
        "Other lines of work focused on specific MWP classes such as light verbs (Tu and Roth, 2011; Vincze et al., 2013) and phrasal verbs (McCarthy et al., 2003; Pichotta and DeNero, 2013).",
        "Our work proposes a uniform treatment to MWPs of varying degrees of compositionality, and avoids defining MWPs explicitly by modelling their LCs as latent variables.",
        "Compositional Distributional Semantics.",
        "Much work in recent years has concentrated on the relation between the distributional representations of composite phrases and the representations of their component sub-parts (Widdows, 2008; Mitchell and Lapata, 2010; Baroni and Zampar-elli, 2010; Coecke et al., 2010).",
        "Several works have used compositional distributional semantics (CDS) representations to assess the compositionality of MWEs, such as noun compounds (Reddy et al., 2011) or verb-noun combinations (Kiela and Clark, 2013).",
        "Despite significant advances, previous work has mostly been concerned with highly compositional cases and does not address the distributional representation of predicates of varying degrees of compositionality.",
        "3 Our Proposal: A Latent LC Approach This section details our approach for distributionally representing MWPs by leveraging their component LCs.",
        "Section 3.1 describes our general approach, Section 3.2 presents our model and Section 3.3 details the feature set.",
        "3.1 General Approach and Notation We propose a method for addressing MWPs of varying degrees of compositionality through the integration of the distributional representation of multiple sub-sets of the predicate's words (LCs).",
        "We use it to tackle a supervised prediction task that represents predicates distributionally.",
        "Our model assumes a latent distribution over the LCs, and estimates its parameters so to best conform to the goals of the target prediction task.",
        "Formally, given a predicate p, we denote the set of words comprising it as W (p).",
        "The set of allowable LCs for p is denoted with H p ?",
        "2 W (p) .",
        "H p contains all sub-sets of p that we consider as apriori possible to represent p. For instance, if p is ?likely to give a green light?, H p may include LCs such as ?likely?",
        "or ?give light?.",
        "As our method is aimed at discovering the most relevant LCs, we do not attempt to analyze the MWPs in advance, but rather take an inclusive H p , allowing the model to estimate the relative weights of the LCs.",
        "The task we use as a testbed for our approach is the lexical inference identification task between predicates.",
        "Given a pair of predicates p = (p L , p R ), the task is to predict whether an inference relation holds between them.",
        "For instance, if p L is ?devour?",
        "and p R is ?eat greedily?, the classifier should use the similarity between ?devour?",
        "and ?eat?",
        "in order to correctly predict an inference relation in this case.",
        "Selecting the wider LC ?eat greedily?",
        "might result in sparser statistics.",
        "In other examples, however, taking a wider LC is potentially beneficial.",
        "For instance, the dissimilarity between ?take?",
        "and ?make?",
        "should not prevent the classifier from identifying the inference relation between ?take a step?",
        "and ?make a step?.",
        "Our statistical model aims at predicting the correct label by making use of partially overlapping LCs of various sizes, both for the premise left-hand side (LHS) predicate p L and the hypothesis right-hand side (RHS) predicate p R .",
        "More for-mally, we take the space of values for our latent LC variables to be H p L ,p R = H p L ?H p R .",
        "Our evaluation dataset consists of pairs p (i) = (p (i) L , p (i) R ) for i ?",
        "{1, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ",M}, where M is the number of examples available, coupled with their gold-standard labels y (i) ?",
        "{1,?1}.",
        "For brevity, we denote H (i) = H p (i) = H p (i) L ,p (i) R .",
        "We also as-646 sume the existence of a feature function ?",
        "(p, y, h) which maps a triplet of a predicate pair p, an inference label y, and a latent state h ?",
        "H p to R d for some integer d. We denote the training set by D. 3.2 The Model We address the task with a latent variable log-linear model, representing the LCs of the predicates.",
        "We choose this model for its generality, conceptual simplicity, and because it allows to easily incorporate various feature sets and sets of latent variables.",
        "We introduce L 2 regularization to avoid over-fitting.",
        "We use maximum likelihood estima-tion, and arrive at the following objective function: L(w|D) = 1 M M X i=1 logP (y (i) |p (i) , w)?",
        "?",
        "2 ?w?",
        "2 = = 1 n n X i=1 0 @ log X h?H (i) exp ?",
        "w > ?",
        "(p (i) , y (i) , h) ?",
        "?",
        "logZ(w, i) ?",
        "?",
        "?",
        "2 ?w?",
        "2 where: Z(w, i) = X y?",
        "{?1,1} X h?H i exp(w > ?",
        "(p i , y, h)).",
        "We maximizeL using the BFGS algorithm (No- cedal and Wright, 1999).",
        "The gradient (with respect to w) is the following: ?L = E h [?",
        "(p i , y i , h)]?",
        "E h,y [?",
        "(p i , y, h)]?",
        "?",
        "?",
        "w H p can be defined to be any sub-set of 2 W (p) given that taking an expectation over H can be done efficiently.",
        "It is therefore possible to use prior linguistic knowledge to consider only sub-sets of p that are likely to be non-compositional (e.g., verb-preposition or verb-noun pairs).",
        "In our experiments we attempt to keep the approach maximally general, and defineH p to be the set of all subsets of size 1 or 2 of content words in W p 1 .",
        "We bound the size of h ?",
        "H p in order to retain computational efficiency and a sufficient frequency of the LCs in H p .",
        "MWPs of length greater than 2 are effectively approximated by their set of subsets of sizes 1 and 2.",
        "Each h can therefore be written as a 4-tuple (h A L , h B L , h A R , h B R ), where h A L (h A R ) denotes the first word of the LHS (RHS) predicate's LC.",
        "h B L (h B R ) denotes the (possibly empty) second word of the predicate.",
        "Inference is carried out by maximizing P (y|p (i) ) over y.",
        "As |H p | = O(k 4 ), where k is the 1 We use a POS tagger to identify content words.",
        "Prepositions are considered content words under this definition.",
        "number of content words in p, and as the number of content words is usually small 2 , inference can be carried out by directly summing over H (i) .",
        "Initialization.",
        "The introduction of latent variables into the log-linear model leads to a non-convex objective function.",
        "Consequently, BFGS is not guaranteed to converge to the global opti-mum, but rather to a stationary point.",
        "The result may therefore depend on the parameter initialization.",
        "Indeed, preliminary experiments showed that both initializing w to be zero and using a random initializer results in lower performance.",
        "Instead, we initialize our model with a simplified convex model that fixes the LCs to be the pair of left-most content words comprising each of the predicates.",
        "This is a common method for selecting the predicate's LC (e.g., Melamud et al., 2013a).",
        "Once h has been fixed, the model collapses to a convex log-linear model.",
        "The optimal w is then taken as an initialization point for the latent variable model.",
        "While this method may still not converge to the global maximum, our experiments show that this initialization technique yields high quality values for w (see Section 6).",
        "3.3 Feature Set This section lists the features used for our experiments.",
        "We intentionally select a feature set that relies on either completely unsupervised or shallow processing tools that are available for a wide variety of languages and domains.",
        "Given a predicate pair p (i) , a label y ?",
        "{1,?1} and a latent state h ?",
        "H (i) , we define their feature vector as ?",

        "(p (i) , h) requires a reference corpus R that contains triplets of the type (p, x, y) where p is a binary predicate and x and y are its arguments.",
        "We use the Reverb corpus as R in our experiments (Fader et al., 2011; see Section 4).",
        "We refrain from encoding features that directly reflect the vocabulary of the training set.",
        "Such features are not applicable beyond that set's vocabulary, and as available datasets contain no more than a few thousand examples, these features are unlikely to generalize well.",
        "Table 1 presents the set of features we use in our experiments.",
        "The features can be divided into two main categories: similarity features between the LHS and the RHS predicates (table's top), and features that reflect the individual properties of each 2 |H p | is about 15 on average in our dataset, where less than 5% of the H (i) are of size greater than 50.",

        "Information about the second most frequent POS tag can be important in identifying light verb constructions, such as ?take a swim?",
        "or ?give a smile?, where the object is derived from a verb.",
        "It can thus be interpreted as a generalization 648 of the feature that indicates whether the object is a deverbal noun, which is used by some light verb identification algorithms (Tu and Roth, 2011).",
        "In cases where h L is of size 2, we additionally encode features that apply to the conjunction of h A L and h B L .",
