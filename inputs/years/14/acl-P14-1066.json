        "The phrase translation model, also known as the phrase table, is one of the core components of phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) systems.",
        "The most common method of constructing the phrase table takes a two-phase approach (Koehn et al. 2003).",
        "First, the bilingual phrase pairs are extracted heuristically from an automatically word-aligned training data.",
        "The second phase, which is the focus of this paper, is parameter estimation where each phrase pair is assigned with some scores that are estimated based on counting these phrases or their words using the same word-aligned training data.",
        "Phrase-based SMT systems have achieved state-of-the-art performance largely due to the fact that long phrases, rather than single words, are used as translation units so that useful context information can be captured in selecting translations.",
        "However, longer phrases occur less often in training data, leading to a severe data sparseness problem in parameter estimation.",
        "There has been a plethora of research reported in the literature on improving parameter estimation for the phrase translation model (e.g., DeNero et al. 2006; Wuebker et al. 2010; He and Deng 2012; Gao and He 2013).",
        "This paper revisits the problem of scoring a phrase translation pair by developing a Continuous-space Phrase Translation Model (CPTM).",
        "The translation score of a phrase pair in this model is computed as follows.",
        "First, we represent each phrase as a bag-of-words vector, called word vector henceforth.",
        "We then project the word vector, in either the source language or the target lan-guage, into a respective continuous feature vector in a common low-dimensional space that is language independent.",
        "The projection is performed by a multi-layer neural network.",
        "The projected feature vector forms the continuous representation of a phrase.",
        "Finally, the translation score of a source-target phrase pair is computed by the distance between their feature vectors.",
        "The main motivation behind the CPTM is to alleviate the data sparseness problem associated with the traditional counting-based methods by grouping phrases with a similar meaning across different languages.",
        "This style of grouping is made possible because of the distributed nature of the continuous-space representations for phrases.",
        "No such sharing was possible in the original symbolic space for representing words or phrases.",
        "In this model, semantically or grammatically related phrases, in both the source and the target lan-guages, would tend to have similar (close) feature vectors in the continuous space, guided by the training objective.",
        "Since the translation score is a smooth function of these feature vectors, a small 699 change in the features should only lead to a small change in the translation score.",
        "The primary research task in developing the CPTM is learning the continuous representation of a phrase that is effective for SMT.",
        "Motivated by recent studies on continuous-space language models (e.g., Bengio et al. 2003; Mikolov et al. 2011; Schwenk et al., 2012), we use a neural network to project a word vector to a feature vector.",
        "Ideally, the projection would discover those latent features that are useful to differentiate good translations from bad ones, for a given source phrase.",
        "However, there is no training data with explicit annotation on the quality of phrase translations.",
        "The phrase translation pairs are hidden in the parallel source-target sentence pairs, which are used to train the traditional translation models.",
        "The quality of a phrase translation can only be judged implicitly through the translation quality of the sentences, as measured by BLEU, which contain the phrase pair.",
        "In order to overcome this challenge and let the BLEU metric guide the projection learning, we propose a new method to learn the parameters of a neural network.",
        "This new method, via the choice of an appropriate objective function in training, automatically forces the feature vector of a source phrase to be closer to the feature vectors of its candidate translations.",
        "As a result, the BLEU score is improved when these translations are selected by an SMT decoder to produce final, sentence-level translations.",
        "The new learning method makes use of the L-BFGS algorithm and the expected BLEU as the objective function defined on N-best lists.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, the CPTM proposed in this paper is the first continuous-space phrase translation model that makes use of joint representations of a phrase in the source language and its translation in the target language (to be detailed in Section 4) and that is shown to lead to significant improvement over a standard phrase-based SMT system (to be detailed in Section 6).",
        "Like the traditional phrase translation model, the translation score of each bilingual phrase pair is modeled explicitly in our model.",
        "However, instead of estimating the phrase translation score on aligned parallel data, our model intends to capture the grammatical and semantic similarity between a source phrase and its paired target phrase by projecting them into a common, continuous space that is language independent.",
        "1 Niehues et al. (2011) use different translation units in order to integrate the n-gram translation model into the phrase-based approach.",
        "However, it is not clear how a continuous The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 reviews previous work.",
        "Section 3 reviews the log-linear model for phrase-based SMT and Sections 4 presents the CPTM.",
        "Section 5 describes the way the model parameters are esti-mated, followed by the experimental results in Section 6.",
        "Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.",
        "2 Related Work Representations of words or documents as continuous vectors have a long history.",
        "Most of the earlier latent semantic models for learning such vectors are designed for information retrieval (Deerwester et al. 1990; Hofmann 1999; Blei et al. 2003).",
        "In contrast, recent work on continuous space language models, which estimate the probability of a word sequence in a continuous space (Bengio et al. 2003; Mikolov et al. 2010), have advanced the state of the art in language modeling, outperforming the traditional n-gram model on speech recognition (Mikolov et al. 2012; Sunder-meyer et al. 2013) and machine translation (Mikolov 2012; Auli et al. 2013).",
        "Because these models are developed for monolingual settings, word embedding from these models is not directly applicable to translation.",
        "As a result, variants of such models for cross-lingual scenarios have been proposed so that words in different languages are projected into the shared latent vector space (Dumais et al. 1997; Platt et al. 2010; Vinokourov et al. 2002; Yih et al. 2011; Gao et al. 2011; Huang et al. 2013; Zou et al. 2013).",
        "In principle, a phrase table can be derived using any of these cross-lingual models, although decoupling the derivation from the SMT training often results in suboptimal performance (e.g., measured in BLEU), as we will show in Section 6.",
        "Recently, there is growing interest in applying continuous-space models for translation.",
        "The most related to this study is the work of continuous space n-gram translation models (Schwenk et al. 2007; Schwenk 2012; Son et al. 2012), where the feed-forward neural network language model is extended to represent translation probabilities.",
        "However, these earlier studies focused on the n-gram translation models, where the translation probability of a phrase or a sentence is decomposed as a product of n-gram probabilities as in a standard n-gram language model.",
        "Therefore, it is not clear how their approaches can be applied to the phrase translation model1, which is much more version of such a model can be trained efficiently because the factor models used by Son et al. cannot be applied directly.",
        "700 widely used in modern SMT systems.",
        "In contrast, our model learns jointly the representations of a phrase in the source language as well as its translation in the target language.",
        "The recurrent continuous translation models proposed by Kalchbren-ner and Blunsom (2013) also adopt the recurrent language model (Mikolov et al. 2010).",
        "But unlike the n-gram translation models above, they make no Markov assumptions about the dependency of the words in the target sentence.",
        "Continuous space models have also been used for generating translations for new words (Mikolov et al. 2013a) and ITG reordering (Li et al. 2013).",
        "There has been a lot of research on improving the phrase table in phrase-based SMT (Marcu and Wong 2002; Lamber and Banchs 2005; Denero et al. 2006; Wuebker et al. 2010; Zhang et al., 2011; He and Deng 2012; Gao and He 2013).",
        "Among them, (Gao and He 2013) is most relevant to the work described in this paper.",
        "They estimate phrase translation probabilities using a discriminative training method under the N-best reranking framework of SMT.",
        "In this study we use the same objective function to learn the continuous representations of phrases, integrating the strengths associated with these earlier studies.",

        "First, we develop a novel phrase translation model for SMT, where joint representations are exploited of a phrase in the source language and of its translation in the target language, and where the translation score of the pair of source-target phrases are represented as the distance between their feature vectors in a low-di-mensional, continuous space.",
        "The space is derived from the representations generated using a multilayer neural network.",
        "Second, we present a new learning method to train the weights in the multilayer neural network for the end-to-end BLEU metric directly.",
        "The training method is based on L-BFGS.",
        "We describe in detail how the gradient in closed form, as required for efficient optimiza-tion, is derived.",
        "The objective function, which takes the form of the expected BLEU computed from N-best lists, is very different from the usual objective functions used in most existing architectures of neural networks, e.g., cross entropy (Hin- ton et al. 2012) or mean square error (Deng et al. 2012).",
        "We hence have provided details in the derivation of the gradient, which can serve as an example to guide the derivation of neural network learning with other non-standard objective functions in the future.",
        "Our evaluation on two WMT data sets show that incorporating the continuous-space phrase translation model into the log-linear framework significantly improves the accuracy of a state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT system, leading to a gain up to 1.3 BLEU.",
        "Careful implementation of the L-BFGS optimization based on the BLEU-centric objective function, together with the associated closed-form gradient, is a key to the success.",
        "A natural extension of this work is to expand the model and learning algorithm from shallow to deep neural networks.",
        "The deep models are expected to produce more powerful and flexible semantic representations (e.g., Tur et al., 2012), and thus greater performance gain than what is presented in this paper.",
