        "Recent years have seen a surge of interest in single word vector spaces (Turney and Pantel, 2010; Collobert et al., 2011; Mikolov et al., 2013) and their successful use in many natural language applications.",
        "Examples include information retrieval (Manning et al., 2008), search query expansions (Jones et al., 2006), document classification (Se- bastiani, 2002), and question answering (Yih et al., 2013).",
        "Vector spaces have been also popular in cognitive science figuring prominently in simulations of human behavior involving semantic prim-ing, deep dyslexia, text comprehension, synonym selection, and similarity judgments (see Griffiths et al., 2007).",
        "In general, these models specify mechanisms for constructing semantic representations from text corpora based on the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1970): words that appear in similar linguistic contexts are likely to have related meanings.",
        "Word meaning, however, is also tied to the physical world.",
        "Words are grounded in the external environment and relate to sensorimotor experience (Regier, 1996; Landau et al., 1998; Barsalou, 2008).",
        "To account for this, new types of perceptually grounded distributional models have emerged.",
        "These models learn the meaning of words based on textual and perceptual input.",
        "The latter is approximated by feature norms elicited from humans (Andrews et al., 2009; Steyvers, 2010; Silberer and Lapata, 2012), visual information extracted automatically from images, (Feng and Lapata, 2010; Bruni et al., 2012a; Silberer et al., 2013) or a combination of both (Roller and Schulte im Walde, 2013).",
        "Despite differences in formulation, most existing models conceptualize the problem of meaning representation as one of learning from multiple views corresponding to different modalities.",
        "These models still represent words as vectors resulting from the combination of representations with different statistical properties that do not necessarily have a natural correspondence (e.g., text and images).",
        "In this work, we introduce a model, illustrated in Figure 1, which learns grounded meaning representations by mapping words and images into a common embedding space.",
        "Our model uses stacked autoencoders (Bengio et al., 2007) to induce semantic representations integrating visual and textual information.",
        "The literature describes several successful approaches to multimodal learning using different variants of deep networks (Ngiam et al., 2011; Srivastava and Salakhutdinov, 2012) and data sources including text, images, audio, and video.",
        "Unlike most previous work, our model is defined at a finer level of granularity ?",
        "it computes meaning representations for individual words and is unique in its use of attributes as a means of representing the textual and visual modalities.",
        "We follow Silberer et al. (2013) in arguing that an attribute-centric representation is expedient for several reasons.",
        "Firstly, attributes provide a natural way of expressing salient properties of word meaning as demonstrated in norming studies (e.g., McRae et al., 2005) where humans often employ attributes when asked to describe a concept.",
        "Secondly, from 721 a modeling perspective, attributes allow for easier integration of different modalities, since these are rendered in the same medium, namely, language.",
        "Thirdly, attributes are well-suited to describing visual phenomena (e.g., objects, scenes, actions).",
        "They allow to generalize to new instances for which there are no training examples available and to transcend category and task boundaries whilst offering a generic description of visual data (Farhadi et al., 2009).",
        "Our model learns multimodal representations from attributes which are automatically inferred from text and images.",
        "We evaluate the embeddings it produces on two tasks, namely word similarity and categorization.",
        "In the first task, model estimates of word similarity (e.g., gem?jewel are similar but glass?magician are not) are compared against elicited similarity ratings.",
        "We performed a large-scale evaluation on a new dataset consisting of human similarity judgments for 7,576 word pairs.",
        "Unlike previous efforts such as the widely used WordSim353 collection (Finkelstein et al., 2002), our dataset contains ratings for visual and textual similarity, thus allowing to study the two modalities (and their contribution to meaning rep-resentation) together and in isolation.",
        "We also assess whether the learnt representations are appropriate for categorization, i.e., grouping a set of objects into meaningful semantic categories (e.g., peach and apple are members of FRUIT, whereas chair and table are FURNITURE).",
        "On both tasks, our model outperforms baselines and related models.",
        "2 Related Work The presented model has connections to several lines of work in NLP, computer vision research, and more generally multimodal learning.",
        "We review related work in these areas below.",
        "Grounded Semantic Spaces Grounded semantic spaces are essentially distributional models augmented with perceptual information.",
        "A model akin to Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer and Dumais, 1997) is proposed in Bruni et al. (2012b) who concatenate two independently constructed textual and visual spaces and subsequently project them onto a lower-dimensional space using Singular Value Decomposition.",
        "Several other models have been extensions of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003) where topic distributions are learned from words and other perceptual units.",
        "Feng and Lapata (2010) use visual words which they extract from a corpus of multimodal documents (i.e., BBC news articles and their associated images), whereas others (Steyvers, 2010; Andrews et al., 2009; Silberer and Lapata, 2012) use feature norms obtained in longitudinal elicitation studies (see McRae et al. (2005) for an example) as an approximation of the visual environment.",
        "More recently, topic models which combine both feature norms and visual words have also been introduced (Roller and Schulte im Walde, 2013).",
        "Drawing inspiration from the successful application of attribute classifiers in object recognition, Silberer et al. (2013) show that automatically predicted visual attributes act as substitutes for feature norms without any critical information loss.",
        "The visual and textual modalities on which our model is trained are decoupled in that they are not derived from the same corpus (we would expect co-occurring images and text to correlate to some extent) but unified in their representation by natural language attributes.",
        "The use of stacked autoencoders to extract a shared lexical meaning representation is new to our knowledge, although, as we explain below related to a large body of work on deep learning.",
        "Multimodal Deep Learning Our work employs deep learning (a.k.a deep networks) to project linguistic and visual information onto a unified representation that fuses the two modalities together.",
        "The goal of deep learning is to learn multiple levels of representations through a hierarchy of network architectures, where higher-level representations are expected to help define higher-level concepts.",
        "A large body of work has focused on projecting words and images into a common space using a variety of deep learning methods ranging from deep and restricted Boltzman machines (Srivastava and Salakhutdinov, 2012; Feng et al., 2013), to autoencoders (Wu et al., 2013), and recursive neural networks (Socher et al., 2013b).",
        "Similar methods have been employed to combine other modalities such as speech and video (Ngiam et al., 2011) or images (Huang and Kingsbury, 2013).",
        "Although our model is conceptually similar to these studies (especially those applying stacked autoencoders), it differs considerably from them in at least two aspects.",
        "Firstly, most of these approaches aim to learn a shared representation between modalities 722 so as to infer some missing modality from others (e.g., to infer text from images and vice versa); in contrast, we aim to learn an optimal representation for each modality and their optimal combination.",
        "Secondly, our problem setting is different from the former studies, which usually deal with classification tasks and fine-tune the deep neural networks using training data with explicit class la-bels; in contrast we fine-tune our autoencoders using a semi-supervised criterion.",
        "That is, we use indirect supervision in the form of object classification in addition to the objective of reconstructing the attribute-centric input representation.",
        "3 Autoencoders for Grounded Semantics 3.1 Background Our model learns higher-level meaning representations for single words from textual and visual input in a joint fashion.",
        "We first briefly review autoencoders in Section 3.1 with emphasis on aspects relevant to our model which we then describe in Section 3.2.",
        "Autoencoders An autoencoder is an unsupervised neural network which is trained to reconstruct a given input from its latent representation (Bengio, 2009).",

        "which maps an input vector x (i) to a latent representation y (i) = f ?",

        "Parameters ?",
        "and ?",
        "?",
        "can be optimized by gradient descent methods.",
        "Autoencoders are a means to learn representations of some input by retaining useful features in the encoding phase which help to reconstruct the input, whilst discarding useless or noisy ones.",
        "To this end, different strategies have been employed to guide parameter learning and constrain the hidden representation.",
        "Examples include imposing a bottleneck to produce an under-complete representation of the input, using sparse representa-tions, or denoising.",
        "Denoising Autoencoders The training criterion with denoising autoencoders is the reconstruction of clean input x (i) given a corrupted version ?x (i) (Vincent et al., 2010).",
        "The underlying idea is that the learned latent representation is good if the autoencoder is capable of reconstructing the actual input from its corruption.",
        "The reconstruction error for an input x (i) with loss function L then is: L(x (i) ,g ?",
        "?",
        "( f ?",
        "(?x (i) ))) (2) One possible corruption process is masking noise, where the corrupted version ?x (i) results from randomly setting a fraction v of x (i) to 0.",
        "Stacked Autoencoders Several (denoising) autoencoders can be used as building blocks to form a deep neural network (Bengio et al., 2007; Vincent et al., 2010).",
        "For that purpose, the autoencoders are pre-trained layer by layer, with the current layer being fed the latent representation of the previous autoencoder as input.",
        "Using this unsupervised pre-training procedure, initial parameters are found which approximate a good solution.",
        "Subse-quently, the original input layer and hidden representations of all the autoencoders are stacked and all network parameters are fine-tuned with back-propagation.",
        "To further optimize the parameters of the net-work, a supervised criterion can be imposed on top of the last hidden layer such as the minimization of a prediction error on a supervised task (Bengio, 2009).",
        "Another approach is to unfold the stacked autoencoders and fine-tune them with respect to the minimization of the global reconstruction error (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006).",
        "Alternatively, a semi-supervised criterion can be used (Ranzato and Szummer, 2008; Socher et al., 2011) through combination of the unsupervised training criterion (global reconstruction) with a supervised criterion (prediction of some target given the latent repre-sentation).",
        "3.2 Semantic Representations To learn meaning representations of single words from textual and visual input, we employ stacked (denoising) autoencoders (SAEs).",
        "Both input modalities are vector-based representations of words, or, more precisely, the objects they refer to (e.g., canary, trolley).",
        "The vector dimensions correspond to textual and visual attributes, examples of which are shown in Table 1.",

        "Input to the model are single-word vector representations obtained from text and images.",
        "Vector dimensions correspond to textual and visual attributes, respectively (see Table 1).",
        "in Section 4.1.",
        "We first train SAEs with two hidden layers (codings) for each modality separately.",
        "Then, we join these two SAEs by feeding their respective second coding simultaneously to another autoencoder, whose hidden layer thus yields the fused meaning representation.",
        "Finally, we stack all layers and unfold them in order to fine-tune the SAE.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the model.",
        "Unimodal Autoencoders For both modalities, we use the hyperbolic tangent function as activation function for encoder f ?",
        "and decoder g ?",
        "?",
        "and an entropic loss function for L. The weights of each autoencoder are tied, i.e., W ?",
        "= W T .",
        "We employ denoising autoencoders (DAEs) for pre-training the textual modality.",
        "Regarding the visual autoen-coder, we derive a new (?denoised?)",
        "target vector to be reconstructed for each input vector x (i) , and treat x (i) itself as corrupted input.",
        "The unimodal autoencoder is thus trained to denoise a given input.",
        "The target vector is derived as follows: each object o in our data is represented by multiple im-ages, and each image is in turn represented by a visual attribute vector x (i) .",
        "The target vector is the sum of x (i) and the centroid x (j) of the remaining attribute vectors representing object o. Bimodal Autoencoder The bimodal autoencoder is fed with the concatenated final hidden codings of the visual and textual modalities as input and maps these inputs to a joint hidden layer ?y with B units.",
        "We normalize both unimodal input codings to unit length.",
        "Again, we use tied weights for the bimodal autoencoder.",
        "We also encourage the autoencoder to detect dependencies between the two modalities while learning the mapping to the bimodal hidden layer.",
        "We therefore apply masking noise to one modality with a masking factor v (see Section 3.1), so that the corrupted modality optimally has to rely on the other modality in order to reconstruct its missing input features.",
        "Stacked Bimodal Autoencoder We finally build a stacked bimodal autoencoder (SAE) with all pre-trained layers and fine-tune them with respect to a semi-supervised criterion.",
        "That is, we unfold the stacked autoencoder and furthermore add a softmax output layer on top of the bimodal layer ?y that outputs predictions ?",

        "Weights are log-likelihood ratio scores expressing how strongly an attribute and a word are associated.",
        "We only retained the ten highest scored attributes for each target word.",
        "This returned a total of 2,362 dimensions for the textual vectors.",
        "Association scores were scaled to the [?1,1] range.",
        "To obtain visual vectors, we followed the methodology put forward in Silberer et al. (2013).",
        "Specifically, we used an updated version of their dataset to train SVM-based attribute classifiers that predict visual attributes for images (Farhadi et al., 2009).",
        "The dataset is a taxonomy of 636 visual attributes (e.g., has wings, made of wood) and nearly 700K images from ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) describing more than 500 of McRae et al.'s (2005) nouns.",
        "The classifiers perform reasonably well with an interpolated average precision of 0.52.",
        "We only considered attributes assigned to at least two nouns in the dataset, obtaining a 414 dimensional vector for each noun.",

        "Some performance gains could be expected if parameter optimization took place separately for each task.",
        "However, we wanted to avoid overfitting, and show that our parameters are robust across tasks and datasets.",

        "This is for a good reason, as most abstract words do not have discernible attributes, or at least attributes that participants would agree upon.",
        "We thus created a new dataset consisting exclusively of McRae et al. (2005) nouns which we hope will be useful for the development and evaluation of grounded semantic space models.",
