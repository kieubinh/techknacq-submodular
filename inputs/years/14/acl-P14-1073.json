        "Variation poses a serious challenge for determining who or what a name refers to.",
        "For instance, Wikipedia contains more than 100 variations of the name Barack Obama as redirects to the U.S. President article, including: President Obama Barack H. Obama, Jr. Barak Obamba Barry Soetoro To relate different names, one solution is to use specifically tailored measures of name similarity such as Jaro-Winkler similarity (Winkler, 1999; Cohen et al., 2003).",
        "This approach is brittle, however, and fails to adapt to the test data.",
        "Another option is to train a model like stochastic edit distance from known pairs of similar names (Ristad and Yian-ilos, 1998; Green et al., 2012), but this requires supervised data in the test domain.",
        "Even the best model of name similarity is not enough by itself, since two names that are similar?",
        "even identical?do not necessarily corefer.",
        "Document context is needed to determine whether they may be talking about two different people.",
        "In this paper, we propose a method for jointly (1) learning similarity between names and (2) clustering name mentions into entities, the two major components of cross-document coreference resolution systems (Baron and Freedman, 2008; Finin et al., 2009; Rao et al., 2010; Singh et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2012; Green et al., 2012).",
        "Our model is an evolutionary generative process based on the name variation model of Andrews et al. (2012), which stipulates that names are often copied from previously generated names, perhaps with mutation (spelling edits).",
        "This can deduce that rather than being names for different entities, Barak Obamba and Barock obama more likely arose from the frequent name Barack Obama as a common ancestor, which accounts for most of their letters.",
        "This can also relate seemingly dissimilar names via multiple steps in the generative process: Taylor Swift?",
        "T-Swift?",
        "T-Swizzle Our model learns without supervision that these all refer to the the same entity.",
        "Such creative spellings are especially common on Twitter and other social media; we give more examples of coreferents learned by our model in Section 8.4.",
        "Our primary contributions are improvements on Andrews et al. (2012) for the entity clustering task.",
        "Their inference procedure only clustered types (dis- tinct names) rather than tokens (mentions in con-text), and relied on expensive matrix inversions for learning.",
        "Our novel approach features: ?4.1 A topical model of which entities from previously written text an author tends to mention from previously written text.",
        "?4.2 A name mutation model that is sensitive to features of the input and output characters and takes a reader's comprehension into account.",
        "?5 A scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler used in training and inference.",
        "775 ?7 A minimum Bayes risk decoding procedure to pick an output clustering.",
        "The procedure is applicable to any model capable of producing a posterior over coreference decisions.",
        "We evaluate our approach by comparing to several baselines on datasets from three different gen-res: Twitter, newswire, and blogs.",
        "2 Overview and Related Work Cross-document coreference resolution (CDCR) was first introduced by Bagga and Baldwin (1998b).",
        "Most approaches since then are based on the intuitions that coreferent names tend to have ?similar?",
        "spellings and tend to appear in ?similar?",
        "contexts.",
        "The distinguishing feature of our system is that both notions of similarity are learned together without supervision.",
        "We adopt a ?phylogenetic?",
        "generative model of coreference.",
        "The basic insight is that coreference is created when an author thinks of an entity that was mentioned earlier in a similar context, and mentions it again in a similar way.",
        "The author may alter the name mention string when copying it, but both names refer to the same entity.",
        "Either name may later be copied further, leading to an evolutionary tree of mentions?a phylogeny.",
        "Phylogenetic models are new to information extraction.",
        "In computational historical linguistics, Bouchard-C?ot?e et al. (2013) have also modeled the mutation of strings along the edges of a phylogeny; but for them the phylogeny is observed and most mentions are not, while we observe the mentions only.",
        "To apply our model to the CDCR task, we observe that the probability that two name mentions are coreferent is the probability that they arose from a common ancestor in the phylogeny.",
        "So we design a Monte Carlo sampler to reconstruct likely phylogenies.",
        "A phylogeny must explain every observed name.",
        "While our model is capable of generating each name independently, a phylogeny will generally achieve higher probability if it explains similar names as being similar by mutation (rather than by coincidence).",
        "Thus, our sampled phylogenies tend to make similar names coreferent?especially long or unusual names that would be expensive to generate repeatedly, and especially in contexts that are topically similar and therefore have a higher prior probability of coreference.",
        "For learning, we iteratively adjust our model's parameters to better explain our samples.",
        "That is, we do unsupervised training via Monte Carlo EM.",
        "What is learned?",
        "An important component of a CDCR system is its model of name similarity (Winkler, 1999; Porter and Winkler, 1997), which is often fixed up front.",
        "This role is played in our system by the name mutation model, which we take to be a variant of stochastic edit distance (Ristad and Yianilos, 1996).",
        "Rather than fixing its parameters before we begin CDCR, we learn them (without supervision) as part of CDCR, by training from samples of reconstructed phylogenies.",
        "Name similarity is also an important component of within-document coreference resolution, and efforts in that area bear resemblance to our approach.",
        "Haghighi and Klein (2010) describe an ?entity- centered?",
        "model where a distance-dependent Chinese restaurant process is used to pick previous coreferent mentions within a document.",
        "Similarly, Durrett and Klein (2013) learn a mention similarity model based on labeled data.",
        "Our cross-document setting has no observed mention ordering and no observed entities: we must sum over all possibili-ties, a challenging inference problem.",
        "The second major component of CDCR is context-based disambiguation of similar or identical names that refer to the same entity.",
        "Like Kozareva and Ravi (2011) and Green et al. (2012) we use topics as the contexts, but learn mention topics jointly with other model parameters.",

        "We assume that each document has a (single) known language, and that its mentions and their types have been identified by a named-entity recognizer.",
        "We use the object-oriented notation x.v for attribute v of mention x.",
        "Our model generates an ordered sequence x although we do not observe its order.",
        "Thus each mention x has latent position x.i (e.g., x 729 .i = 729).",
        "The entire corpus, including these entities, is generated according to standard topic model assump-tions; we first generate a topic distribution for a document, then sample topics and words for the document (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "However, any topic may generate an entity type, e.g.",
        "PERSON, which is then replaced by a specific name: when PERSON is generated, the model chooses a previous mention of any person and copies it, perhaps mutating its name.",
        "1 Alternatively, the model may manufacture 1 We make the closed-world assumption that the author is 776 a name for a new person, though the name itself may not be new.",
        "If all previous mentions were equally likely, this would be a Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP) in which frequently mentioned entities are more likely to be mentioned again (?the rich get richer?).",
        "We refine that idea by saying that the current topic, lan-guage, and document influence the choice of which previous mention to copy, similar to the distance-dependent CRP (Blei and Frazier, 2011).",
        "2 This will help distinguish multiple John Smith entities if they tend to appear in different contexts.",
        "Formally, each mention x is derived from a parent mention x.p where x.p.i < x.i (the parent came first), x.e = x.p.e (same entity) and x.n is a copy or mutation of x.p.n.",
