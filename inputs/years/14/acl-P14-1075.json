        "Removing low-frequency words from a corpus (often called cutoff) is a common practice to save on the computational costs involved in learning language models and topic models.",
        "In the case of language models, we often have to remove low-frequency words because of a lack of computational resources, since the feature space of k-grams tends to be so large that we sometimes need cutoffs even in a distributed environment (Brants et al., 2007).",
        "In the case of topic models, the intuition is that low-frequency words do not make a large contribution to the statistics of the models.",
        "Actually, when we try to roughly analyze a corpus with topic models, a reduced corpus is enough for the purpose (Steyvers and Griffiths, 2007).",
        "A natural question arises: How many low-frequency words can we remove while maintaining sufficient performance?",
        "Or more generally, by how much can we reduce a corpus/model using a certain strategy and still keep a sufficient level of performance?",
        "There have been many stud-?This work was mainly carried out while the author was with Toshiba Corporation.",
        "ies addressing the question as it pertains to different strategies (Stolcke, 1998; Buchsbaum et al., 1998; Goodman and Gao, 2000; Gao and Zhang, 2002; Ha et al., 2006; Hirsimaki, 2007; Church et al., 2007).",
        "Each of these studies experimentally discusses trade-off relationships between the size of the reduced corpus/model and its performance measured by perplexity, word error rate, and other factors.",
        "To our knowledge, however, there is no theoretical study on the question and no evidence for such a trade-off relationship, especially for topic models.",
        "In this paper, we first address the question from a theoretical standpoint.",
        "We focus on the cutoff strategy for reducing a corpus, since a cutoff is simple but powerful method that is worth study-ing; as reported in (Goodman and Gao, 2000; Gao and Zhang, 2002), a cutoff is competitive with sophisticated strategies such as entropy pruning.",
        "As the basis of our theory, we assume Zipf's law (Zipf, 1935), which is an empirical rule representing a long-tail property of words in a corpus.",
        "Our approach is essentially the same as those in physics, in the sense of constructing a theory while believing experimentally observed results.",
        "For ex-ample, we can derive the distance to the landing point of a ball thrown up in the air with initial speed v 0 and angle ?",
        "as v 0 2 sin(2?",
        ")/g by believing in the experimentally observed gravity acceleration g. In a similar fashion, we will try to clarify the trade-off relationship by believing Zipf's law.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we define the notation and briefly explain Zipf's law and perplexity.",
        "In Section 3, we theoretically derive the trade-off formulae of the cutoff for unigram models, k-gram models, and topic models, each of which represents its perplexity with respect to a reduced vocabulary, under the assumption that the corpus follows Zipf's law.",
        "In addition, we show an approximate behavior of each formula under certain conditions.",
        "In 797 Section 4, we verify the correctness of our theory on synthetic corpora and examine the gap between theory and practice on several real corpora.",
        "Section 5 concludes the paper.",

        "of both sides of the above equation, we find that its plot becomes linear on a log-log graph of r(w) and f(w).",
        "In fact, the result based on a statistical test in (Clauset et al., 2009) reports that the frequencies of words in a corpus completely follow a power law, whereas many datasets with long-tail properties, such as networks, actually do not follow power laws.",

        "According to the definition, a lower perplexity means better generalization performance of p. Another well-known evaluation measure is cross-entropy.",
        "Since cross-entropy is easily calculated as log 2 PP, we can apply many of the results of this paper to cross-entropy.",

        "TheoryAve is the average of Theory1 and TheoryMix.",

        "Therefore, we can use TheoryAve as a heuristic function for estimating the perplexity of topic models.",
        "Since we can calculate an inverse of TheoryAve from the bisection or Newton-Raphson method, we can maximize the reduction rate and ensure an acceptable perplexity based on a user-specified deterioration rate.",
        "According to the fact that the three real corpora with different sizes have a similar tendency, it is expected that we can use our theory for a larger corpus.",
        "Finally, let us examine the computational costs for LDA learning.",
        "Table 2 shows computational time and memory size for LDA learning on the original corpus, (1/10)-reduced corpus, and (1/20)-reduced corpus of Reuters.",
        "Comparing the memory used in the learning with the original corpus and with the (1/10)-reduced corpus of Reuters, we find that the learning on the (1/10)- reduced corpus used 60% of the memory used by the learning on the original corpus.",
        "While the computational time decreased a little, we believe that reducing the memory size helps to reduce computational time for a larger corpus in the sense that it can relax the constraint for in-memory computing.",
        "Although we did not examine the accuracy of real tasks in this paper, there is an interesting report that the word error rate of language models follows a power law with respect to perplexity (Klakow and Peters, 2002).",
        "Thus, we conjecture that the word error rate also has a similar tendency as perplexity with respect to the reduced vocabulary size.",
        "5 Conclusion We studied the relationship between perplexity and vocabulary size of reduced corpora.",
        "We derived trade-off formulae for the perplexity of k-gram models and topic models with respect to the size of reduced vocabulary and showed that each formula approximately has a simple behavior on a log-log graph under certain conditions.",
        "We verified the correctness of our theory on synthetic corpora and examined the gap between theory and practice on real corpora.",
        "We found that the estimation of the perplexity growth rate is reasonable.",
        "This means that we can maximize the reduction rate, thereby ensuring an acceptable perplexity based on a user-specified deterioration rate.",
        "Furthermore, this suggests the possibility that we can theoretically derive empirical parameters, or ?rules of thumb?, for different NLP problems, assuming that a corpus follows Zipf's law.",
        "We believe that our theoretical estimation has the advantages of computational efficiency and scalability especially for very large corpora, although experimental estimations such as cross-validation may be more accurate.",
        "In the future, we want to find out the cause of the gap between theory and practice and extend our theory to bridge the gap, in the same way that we can construct equations of motion with air resistance in the example of the landing point of a ball in Section 1.",
        "For example, promising research directions include using a general law such as the Zipf-Mandelbrot law (Mandelbrot, 1965), a sophisticated model that cares the order of words such as hierarchical Pitman-Yor processes (Wood et al., 2011), and smoothing/backoff methods to handle the sparseness problem.",
