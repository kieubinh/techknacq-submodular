        "The World Wide Web contains information on real-world entities, such as persons, locations and ?",
        "The work is done while Nguyen was a research staff in Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.",
        "organizations, which are interconnected by various semantic relations.",
        "Detecting these relations between two entities is important for many tasks on the Web, such as information retrieval (Salton and McGill, 1986) and information extraction for question answering (Etzioni et al., 2008).",
        "Recent work on relation extraction has demonstrated that supervised machine learning coupled with intelligent feature engineering can provide state-of-the-art performance (Jiang and Zhai, 2007b).",
        "How-ever, most supervised learning algorithms require adequate labeled data for every relation type to be extracted.",
        "Due to the large number of relations among entities, it may be costly to annotate a large enough set of training data to cover each relation type adequately in every new domain of interest.",
        "Instead, it can be more cost-effective to adapt an existing relation extraction system to the new domain using a small set of labeled data.",
        "This paper considers relation adaptation, where a relation extraction system trained on many source domains is adapted to a new target domain.",
        "There are at least three challenges when adapting a relation extraction system to a new domain.",
        "First, the same semantic relation between two entities can be expressed using different lexical or syntactic patterns.",
        "For example, the acquisition of company A by company B can be expressed with ?B bought over by A?, ?A buys B?",
        "and ?A purchases B?.",
        "To extract a relation, we need to capture the different ways in which it can be expressed across different open domains on the Web.",
        "Second, the emphasis or interest on the different relation types varies from domain to domain.",
        "For example, in the organization domain, we may be more interested in extracting relations such as lo-catedIn (between a company and a location) and founderOf (between a company and a person), 807 whereas in the person domain we may be more interested in extracting relations such as liveIn (be- tween a person and a location) and workAt (be- tween a person and a company).",
        "Therefore, although the two domains may have the same set of relations, they probably have different marginal distributions on the relations.",
        "This can produce a negative transfer phenomenon (Rosenstein et al., 2005), where using knowledge from other domains degrades the performance on the target domain.",
        "Hence, when transferring knowledge from multiple domains, it is overly optimistic to believe that all source domains will contribute positively.",
        "We call a source domain irrelevant when it has no or negative contribution to the performance of the target domain.",
        "One example is named entities extraction adaptation, where na?",
        "?ve transfer of information from a mixed-case domain with capitalization information (e.g., news-wire) to a single-case domain (e.g., conversational speech transcripts) will miss most names in the single-case domain due to the absence of case information, which is typically important in the mixed-case domain.",
        "Third, the annotated instances for the target domain are typically much fewer than those for the source domains.",
        "This is primarily due to the lack of resources such as raw target domain documents, time, and people with the expertise.",
        "Together with imbalanced relation distributions inherent in the domain, this can cause some rarer relations to constitute only a very small proportion of the labeled data set.",
        "This makes learning a relation classifier for the target domain challenging.",
        "To tackle these challenges, we propose a two-phase Robust Domain Adaptation (RDA) framework.",
        "In the first phase, Supervised Voting is used to determine the relevance of each source domain to each region in the target domain, using both labeled and unlabeled data in the target domain.",
        "By using also unlabeled data, we alleviate the lack of labeled samples for rarer relations due to imbalanced distributions in relation types.",
        "The second phase uses the relevances determined the first phase to produce a reference predictor by weighing the source-domain predictors for each target domain sample separately.",
        "The intention is to alleviate the effect of mismatched distributions.",
        "The final predictor in the target domain is trained on the labeled target domain data while taking reference from the reference predictions on the unlabeled target domain data.",
        "This ensures reasonable predictive performance even when all the source domains are irrelevant and augments the rarer classes with examples in the unlabeled data.",
        "We compare the proposed two-phase framework with state-of-the-art domain adaptation baselines for the relation extraction task, and we find that our method outperforms the baselines.",
        "2 Related Work Relation extraction is usually considered a classification problem: determine if two given entities in a sentence have a given relation.",
        "Kernel-based supervised methods such as dependency tree kernels (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004), subsequence kernels (Bunescu and Mooney, 2006) and convolution tree kernels (Qian et al., 2008) have been rather successful in learning this task.",
        "However, purely supervised relation extraction methods assume the availability of sufficient labeled data, which may be costly to obtain for new domains.",
        "We address this by augmenting a small labeled data set with other information in the domain adaptation setting.",
        "Bootstrapping methods (Zhu et al., 2009; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Xu et al., 2010; Pa≈üca et al., 2006; Riloff and Jones, 1999) to relation extraction are attractive because they require fewer training instances than supervised approaches.",
        "Bootstrapping methods are either initialized with a few instances (often designated as seeds) of the target relation (Zhu et al., 2009; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000) or a few extraction patterns (Xu et al., 2010).",
        "In subsequent itera-tions, new extraction patterns are discovered, and these are used to extract new instances.",
        "The quality of the extracted relations depends heavily on the seeds (Kozareva and Hovy, 2010).",
        "Different from bootstrapping, we not only use labeled target domain data as seeds, but also leverage on existing source-domain predictors to obtain a robust relation extractor for the target domain.",
        "Open Information Extraction (Open IE) (Et- zioni et al., 2008; Banko et al., 2008; Mesquita et al., 2013) is a domain-independent information extraction paradigm to extract relation tu-ples from collected corpus (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006) and Web (Etzioni et al., 2008; Banko et al., 2008).",
        "Open IE systems are initialized with a few domain-independent extraction patterns.",
        "To create labeled data, the texts are dependency-parsed, and the domain-independent patterns on the parses form the basis for extractions.",
        "Recently, to reduce 808 labeling effort for relation extraction, distant supervision (Mintz et al., 2009; Takamatsu et al., 2012; Min et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2013) has been proposed.",
        "This is an unsupervised approach that exploits textual features in large unlabeled corpora.",
        "In contrast to Open IE, we tune the relation patterns for a domain of interest, using labeled relation instances in source and target domains and unlabeled instances in the target domain.",
        "Our work is also different from the multi-schema matching in database integration (Doan et al., 2003).",
        "Multi-schema matching finds relations between columns of schemas, which have the same semantic.",
        "In addition, current weighted schema matching methods do not address negative transfer and imbalance class distribution.",
        "Domain adaptation methods can be classified broadly into weakly-supervised adaptation (Daum√© and Marcu, 2007; Blitzer et al., 2006; Jiang and Zhai, 2007a; Jiang, 2009), and unsupervised adaptation (Pan et al., 2010; Blitzer et al., 2006; Plank and Moschitti, 2013).",
        "In the weakly-supervised approach, we have plenty of labeled data for the source domain and a few labeled instances in the target domain; in the unsupervised approach, the data for the target domain are not la-beled.",
        "Among these studies, Plank and Moschitti's is the closest to ours because it adapts relation extraction systems to new domains.",
        "Most other works focused on adapting from old to new relation types.",
        "Typical relation adaptation methods first identify a set of common features in source and target domains and then use those features as pivots to map source domain features to the target domain.",
        "These methods usually assume that each source domain is relevant to the task on the target domain.",
        "In addition, these methods do not handle the imbalanced distribution of relation data explicitly.",
        "In this work, we study how to learn the target prediction using only a few seed instances, while dealing with negative transfer and imbalanced relation distribution explicitly.",
        "These issues are seldom explored in relation adaptation.",
        "3 Problem Statement This section defines the domain adaptation problem and describes our feature extraction scheme.",
        "3.1 Relation Extraction Domain Adaptation Given two entities A and B in a sentence S, relation extraction is the task of selecting the relation y between A and B from a fixed set of c relation types, which includes the not-a-relation type.",
        "We introduce a feature extraction ?",
        "that maps the triple (A,B,S) to its feature vector x.",
        "Learning relation extraction can then be abstracted to finding a function p such that p(?",
        "(A,B,S)) = p(x) = y.",
        "For adaptation, we have k source domains and a target domain.",
        "We shall assume that all domains have the same set of relation types.",
        "The target domain has a few labeled data D l = {(x i ,y i )} n l i=1 and plenty of unlabeled data D u = {(x i )} n l +n u n l +1 , where n l and n u are the number of labeled and unlabeled samples respectively, x i is the feature vec-tor, y i is the corresponding label (if available).",
        "Let n = n l + n u .",
        "For the sth source domain, we have an adequate labeled data set D s .",
        "We define domain adaptation as the problem of learning a classifier p for relation extraction in the target domain using the data sets D l , D u and D s , s = 1, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ",k. 3.2 Relational Feature Representation We consider relation extraction as a classification problem, where each pair of entities A and B within a sentence S is a candidate relation instance.",
        "The contexts in which entities A and B co-occur provide useful features to the relations between them.",
        "We use the term context to refer a window of text in which two entities co-occur.",
        "A context might not necessarily be a complete sentence S. Retrieving contexts in which two entities co-occur has been studied in previous works investigating the relations between entities.",
        "Given a pair of entities (A,B) in S, the first step is to express the relation between A and B with some feature representation using a feature extraction scheme ?.",
        "Lexical or syntactic patterns have been successfully used in numerous natural language processing tasks, including relation extraction.",
        "Jiang and Zhai (2007b) have shown that selected lexical and syntactic patterns can give good performance for relation extraction.",
        "Following their work 1 , we also use lexical and syntactic patterns extracted from the contexts to represent the relations between entities.",
        "We extract features from a sequence representation and a parse tree representation of each relation instance.",
        "The details are as follows.",
        "Entity Features Entity types and entity mention types are very useful for relation extraction.",
        "We 1 The source code for extracting entity features is provided by the authors (Jiang and Zhai, 2007b).",
        "809 use a subgraph in the relation instance graph (Jiang and Zhai, 2007b) that contains only the node presenting the head word of the entity A, labeled with the entity type or entity mention types, to describe a single entity attribute.",
        "Sequence Features The sequence representation preserves the order of the tokens as they occur in the original sentence.",
        "Each node in the graph is a token augmented with its relevant attributes.",
        "Syntactic Features The syntactic parse tree of the relation instance sentence can be augmented to represent the relation instance.",
        "Each node is augmented with relevant part-of-speech (POS) using the Python Natural Language Processing Tool Kit.",
        "Each node in the sequence or the parse tree is augmented by an argument tag that indicates whether the node corresponds to entity A, B, both, or neither.",
        "The nodes that represent the argument are also labeled with the entity type, subtype and mention type.",
        "We trim the parse tree of a relation instance so that it contains only the most essential tree components based on constituent dependencies (Qian et al., 2008).",
        "We also use unigram features and bigram features from a relation instance graph.",
        "4 Robust Domain Adaptation In this section, we describe our two-phase ap-proach, which comprises of a Supervised Voting scheme and a combined classifier learning phase.",
        "4.1 Phase 1: Clustering Consistency via Supervised Voting In this section, we use the concept of clustering consistency to determine the relevance of a source domain to particular regions in the target domain.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates this.",
        "There, both enclosing circles in the left and right figures denote the same input space of the target domain.",
        "There are four disjoint regions within the input space, located at the left, right, top and bottom of the space.",
        "There are four classes of labels: plus (+), cross (?",
        "), circle (?)",
        "and asterisk (?).",
        "The labels in the left figure are given by a preliminary predictor in the target domain data, while the labels in the right figure are given by a predictor trained on the source domain data.",
        "Comparing the figures, we see the preliminary predictor and source domain predictor are consistent for the bottom and right regions, Target domain input space with transductive learning using labeled and unlabeled target domain data.",
        "Target domain input space with labels from the predictor trained on the source domain data set.",
        "Figure 1: Clustering consistency is used to determine the relevance of a source domain to a region in the target domain data.",
        "The bottom and right regions are more relevant than the top and left regions.",
        "See text for explanation.",
        "but are inconsistent for the top and left regions.",
        "This suggests that the source domain is very relevant for the bottom and right regions of the target input space, but less so for the top and left regions.",
        "To apply this idea to relation classification, we have to (i) partition the target domain input space into regions and (ii) assign preliminary labels for all the examples.",
        "We approximate the target domain input space with all the samples from D l and D u .",
        "With data from both the labeled and unlabeled data sets, we apply transductive inference or semi-supervised learning (Zhou et al., 2003) to achieve both (i) and (ii).",
        "By augmenting with unlabeled data D u , we aim to alleviate the effect of imbalanced relation distribution, which causes a lack of labeled samples for rarer classes in a small set of labeled data.",
        "Briefly, the known labels in D l are propagated to the entire target input space by encouraging label smoothness in neighborhoods.",
        "The next three paragraphs give more details.",
        "At present, we assume a similarity matrix W , where W i j is the similarity between the ith and the jth input samples in D l ?D u .",
        "Matrix W then determines the neighborhoods.",
