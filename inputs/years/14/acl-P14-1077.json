        "We exploit two kinds of clues to generate constraints which can capture the implicit type and cardinality requirements of a relation.",

        "Identifying predefined kinds of relationship between pairs of entities is crucial for many knowledge base related applications(Suchanek et al., 2013).",
        "In the literature, relation extraction (RE) is usually investigated in a classification style, where relations are simply treated as isolated class labels, while their definitions or background information are sometimes ignored.",
        "Take the relation Capital as an example, we can imagine that this relation will expect a country as its subject and a city as object, and in most cases, a city can be the capital of only one country.",
        "All these clues are no doubt helpful, for instance, Yao et al. (2010) explicitly modeled the expected types of a relation's arguments with the help of Freebase's type taxonomy and obtained promising results for RE.",
        "?",
        "Yansong Feng is the corresponding author.",
        "However, properly capturing and utilizing such typing clues are not trivial.",
        "One of the hurdles here is the lack of off-the-shelf resources and such clues often have to be coded by human experts.",
        "Many knowledge bases do not have a well-defined typing system, let alone fine-grained typing taxonomies with corresponding type recognizers, which are crucial to explicitly model the typing requirements for arguments of a relation, but rather expensive and time-consuming to collect.",
        "Similarly, the cardinality requirements of arguments, e.g., a person can have only one birthdate and a city can only be labeled as capital of one country, should be considered as a strong indicator to eliminate wrong predictions, but has to be coded manually as well.",
        "On the other hand, most previous relation extractors process each entity pair (we will use entity pair and entity tuple exchangeably in the rest of the paper) locally and individually, i.e., the extractor makes decisions solely based on the sentences containing the current entity pair and ignores other related pairs, therefore has difficulties to capture possible disagreements among different entity pairs.",
        "However, when looking at the output of a multi-class relation predictor globally, we can easily find possible incorrect predictions such as a university locates in two different cities, two different cities have been labeled as capital for one country, a country locates in a city and so on.",
        "In this paper, we will address how to derive and exploit two categories of these clues: the expected types and the cardinality requirements of a rela-tion's arguments, in the scenario of relation extraction.",
        "We propose to perform joint inference upon multiple local predictions by leveraging implicit clues that are encoded with relation specific requirements and can be learnt from existing knowledge bases.",
        "Specifically, the joint inference framework operates on the output of a sentence level relation extractor as input, derives 5 types of constraints from an existing KB to implicitly capture 818 the expected type and cardinality requirements for a relation's arguments, and jointly resolve the disagreements among candidate predictions.",
        "We formalize this procedure as a constrained optimization problem, which can be solved by many optimization frameworks.",
        "We use integer linear programming (ILP) as the solver and evaluate our framework on English and Chinese datasets.",
        "The experimental results show that our framework performs better than the state-of-the-art approaches when such clues are applicable to the datasets.",
        "We also show that the automatically learnt clues perform comparably to those refined manually.",
        "In the rest of the paper, we first review related work in Section 2, and in Section 3, we describe our framework in detail.",
        "Experimental setup and results are discussed in Section 4.",
        "We conclude this paper in Section 5.",
        "2 Related Work Since traditional supervised relation extraction methods (Soderland et al., 1995; Zhao and Gr-ishman, 2005) require manual annotations and are often domain-specific, nowadays many efforts focus on semi-supervised or unsupervised methods (Banko et al., 2007; Fader et al., 2011).",
        "Distant supervision (DS) is a semi-supervised RE framework and has attracted many attentions (Bunescu, 2007; Mintz et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2010; Surdeanu et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011; Surdeanu et al., 2012).",
        "DS approaches can predict canonicalized (predefined in KBs) relations for large amount of data and do not need much human involvement.",
        "Since the automatically generated training datasets in DS often contain noises, there are also research efforts focusing on reducing the noisy labels in the training data (Takamatsu et al., 2012).",
        "To bridge the gaps between the relations extracted from open information extraction and the canonicalized relations in KBs, Yao et al. (2012) and Riedel et al. (2013) propose a universal schema which is a union of KB schemas and natural language patterns, making it possible to integrate the unlimited set of uncanonicalized relations in open settings with the relations in existing KBs.",
        "As far as we know, few works have managed to take the relation specific requirements for arguments into account, and most existing works make predictions locally and individually.",
        "The MultiR system allows entity tuples to have more than one relations, but still predicts each entity tuple locally (Hoffmann et al., 2011).",
        "Surdeanu et al. (2012) propose a two-layer multi-instance multi-label (MIML) framework to capture the dependencies among relations.",
        "The first layer is a multi-class classifier making local predictions for single sentences, the output of which are aggregated by the second layer into the entity pair level.",
        "Their approach only captures relation dependen-cies, while we learn implicit relation backgrounds from knowledge bases, including argument type and cardinality requirements.",
        "Riedel et al. (2013) propose to use latent vectors to estimate the preferences between relations and entities.",
        "These can be considered as the latent type information of the relations?",
        "arguments, which is learnt from various data sources.",
        "In contrast, our approach learn implicit clues from existing KBs, and jointly optimize local predictions among different entity tuples to capture both relation argument type clues and cardinality clues.",
        "Li et al. (2011) and Li et al. (2013) use co-occurring statistics among relations or events to jointly improve information extraction performances in ACE tasks, while we mine existing KBs to collect global clues to solve local conflicts and find the optimal aggregation as-signments, regarding existing knowledge facts.",
        "de Lacalle and Lapata (2013) encode general domain knowledge as FOL rules in a topic model while our instantiated constraints are directly operated in an ILP model.",
        "Zhang et al. (2013) utilize relation cardinality to create negative samples for distant supervision while we use both implicit type clues and relation cardinality expectations to discover possible inconsistencies among local predictions.",
        "3 The Framework Our framework takes a set of entity pairs and their supporting sentences as its input.",
        "We first train a preliminary sentence level extractor which can output confidence scores for its predictions, e.g., a maximum entropy or logistic regression model, and use this local extractor to produce local predictions.",
        "In order to implicitly capture the expected type and cardinality requirements for a relation's arguments, we derive two kinds of clues from an existing KB, which are further utilized to discover the disagreements among local candidate predictions.",
        "Our objective is to maximize the overall confidence of all the selected predictions.",
        "819 3.1 Generating Candidate Relations Since we will focus on the open domain relation extraction, we still follow the distant supervision paradigm to collect our training data guided by a KB, and train the local extractor accordingly.",
        "Specifically, we train a sentence level extractor using the maximum entropy model.",
        "Given a sentence containing an entity pair, the model will output the confidence of this sentence representing certain relationship (from a predefined relation set) between the entity pair.",
        "Formally R represents the relation set we are working on, T is the set of entity tuples that we will predict in the test set.",
        "Keep in mind that our local extractor is trained on noisy training data, which, we admit, is not fully reliable.",
        "As we observed in a pilot experiment that there is a good chance that the predictions ranked in the second or third may still be correct, we select top three predictions as the candidate relations for each mention in order to introduce more potentially correct output.",
        "On the other hand, we should discard the predictions whose confidences are too low to be true, where we set up a threshold of 0.1.",
        "For a tuple t, we obtain its candidate relation set by combining the candidate relations of all its mentions, and represent it as R t .",
        "For a candidate relation r ?",
        "R t and a tuple t, we define M r t as all t's mentions whose candidate relations contain r. Now the confidence score of a relation r ?",
        "R t being assigned to tuple t can be calculated as: conf(t, r) = ?",
        "m?M r t MEscore(m, r) (1) where MEscore(m, r) is the confidence of mention m representing relation r output by our preliminary extractor.",
        "Traditionally, both lexical features and syntactic features are used in relation extraction.",
        "Lexical features are the word chains between the subjects and objects in the sentences, while syntactic features are the dependency paths from the subjects to the objects on the dependency graphs of the supporting sentences.",
        "However, lexical features are usually too specific to frequently appear in the test data, while the reliability of syntactic features depends heavily on the quality of dependency parsing tools.",
        "Generally, we expect more potentially correct relations to be put into the candidate relation set for further consideration.",
        "So in conflict conflict conflict conflict Capital: 0.5 LargestCity: 0.4 LocationCity: 0.05 1 1->0 1 USA, New York LocationCity: 0.8 FoundationPlace: 0.15 1 1 New York University, New York Capital: 0.95 LocationCity: 0.03 1 1->0 USA, Washington D.C.",

        "The clues of detecting these inconsistencies can be learnt from a knowledge base.",
        "addition to lexical and syntactic features, we also use n-gram features to train our preliminary relation extraction model.",
        "N-gram features are considered as more ambiguous compared to traditional lexical and syntactic features, and may introduce incorrect predictions, thus improving the recall at the cost of precision.",
        "3.2 Disagreements among the Candidates The candidate relations we obtained in the previous subsection inevitably include many incorrect predictions.",
        "Ideally we should discard those wrong predictions to produce more accurate results.",
        "As discussed earlier, we will exploit from the knowledge base two categories of clues that implicitly capture relations?",
        "backgrounds: their expected argument types and argument cardinalities, based on which we can discover two categories of disagreements among the candidate predictions, summarized as argument type inconsistencies and violations of arguments?",
        "uniqueness, which have been rarely considered before.",
        "We will discuss them in detail, and describe how to learn the clues from a KB afterwards.",
        "Implicit Argument Types Inconsistencies: Generally, the argument types of the correct predictions should be consistent with each other.",
        "Given a relation, its arguments sometimes are required to be certain types of entities.",
        "For example, in Figure 1, the relation LargestCity restricts its subject to be either countries or states, and its object to be cities.",
        "If the predictions among different entity tuples require the same entity to belong to different types, we call this 820 an argument type inconsistency.",
        "Take <USA, New York> and <USA, Washington D.C.> as an example.",
        "In Figure 1, <USA, New York> has a candidate relation LargestCity which restricts USA to be either countries or states, while <USA, Washington D.C.> has a prediction LocationCity which indicates a disagreement in terms of USA's type because the latter prediction expects USA to be an organization located in a city.",
        "This warns that at least one of the two candidate relations is incorrect.",
        "The previous scenario shows that the subjects of two candidate relations may disagree with each other.",
        "From Figure 1, we can observe two more situations: the first one is that the objects of the two candidate relations are inconsistent with each other, for example <New York University, New York> with the prediction LocationCity and <Columbia University, New York> with the prediction LocationCountry.",
        "The second one is that the subject of one candidate relation do not agree with another prediction's object, for example <Richard Fuld, USA> with the prediction Nationality and <USA, New York> with the prediction LocationCity.",
        "Although we have not assigned explicit types to these entities, we can still exploit the inconsistencies implicitly with the help of shared entities.",
        "Note that the implicit argument typing clues here mean whether two relations can share arguments, but NOT enumate what types explicitly their arguments should have.",
        "We formalize all the relation pairs that disagree with each other as follows.",
        "These relation pairs can be divided into three subcategories.",
        "We represent the relation pairs (r i , r j ) that are inconsistent in terms of subjects as C sr , the relations pairs that are inconsistent in terms of objects as C ro , the relation pairs that are inconsistent in terms of one's subject and the other one's object as C rer .",
        "It is worth mentioning that disagreements inside a tuple are also included here.",
        "For instance, an entity tuple <USA, Washington D.C.> in Figure 1 has two candidate relations, Capital and Lo-cationCity.",
        "These two predictions are inconsistent with each other with respect to the type of USA.",
        "They implicitly consider USA as ?country?",
        "and ?organization?, respectively.",
        "Violations of Arguments?",
        "Uniqueness: The previous categories of disagreements are all based on the implicit type information of the relations?",
        "arguments, Now we make use of the clues of argument cardinality requirements.",
        "Given a subject, some relations should have unique objects.",
        "For example, in Figure 1, given USA as the subject of the relation Capital, we can only accept one possible object, because there is great chance that a country only have one capital.",
        "On the other hand, given Washington D.C. as the object of the relation Capital, we can only accept one subject, since usually a city can only be the capital of one country or state.",
        "If these are violating in the candidates, we could know that there may be some incorrect predictions.",
        "We represent the relations expecting unique objects as C ou , and the relations expecting unique subjects as C su .",
        "3.3 Obtaining the Global Clues Now, the issue is how to obtain the clues used in the previous subsection.",
        "That is, how we determine which relations expect certain types of subjects, which relations expect certain types of objects, etc.",
        "These knowledge can be definitely coded by human, or learnt from a KB.",
        "Most existing knowledge bases represent their knowledge facts in the form of (<subject, rela-tion, object>) triple, which can be seen as relational facts between entity tuples.",
        "Usually the triples in a KB are carefully defined by experts.",
        "It is rare to find inconsistencies among the triples in the knowledge base.",
        "The clues are therefore learnt from KBs, and further refined manually if needed.",
        "Given two relations r 1 and r 2 , we query the KB for all tuples bearing the relation r 1 or r 2 .",
        "We use S i and O i to represent r i 's (i ?",
        "{1, 2}) subject set and object set, respectively.",
        "We adopt the point-wise mutual information (PMI) to estimate the dependency between the argument sets of two rela-tions: PMI(A,B) = log p(A,B) p(A)p(B) (2) where p(A,B) is number of the entities both in A and B, p(A) and p(B) are the numbers of the entities in A and B, respectively.",
        "For any pair of relations from R ?",
        "R, we calculate four scores: PMI(S 1 , S 2 ), PMI(O 1 , O 2 ), PMI(S 1 , O 2 ) and PMI(S 2 , O 1 ).",
        "To make more stable esti-mations, we set up a threshold for the PMI.",
        "If PMI(S 1 , S 2 ) is lower than the threshold, we will consider that r 1 and r 2 cannot share a subject.",
        "Things are similar for the other three scores.",
        "The threshold is set to -3 in this paper.",
        "821 We can also learn the uniqueness of arguments for relations.",
        "For each pre-defined relation in R, we collect all the triples containing this relation, and count the portion of the triples which only have one object for each subject, and the portion of the triples which only have one subject for each object.",
        "The relations whose portions are higher than the threshold will be considered to have unique argument values.",
        "This threshold is set to 0.8 in this paper.",
        "3.4 Integer Linear Program Formulation As discussed above, given a set of entity pairs and their candidate relations output by a preliminary extractor, our goal is to find an optimal configuration for all those entities pairs jointly, solving the disagreements among those candidate predictions and maximizing the overall confidence of the selected predictions.",
        "This is an NP-hard optimization problem.",
        "Many optimization models can be used to obtain the approximate solutions.",
        "In this paper, we propose to solve the problem by using an ILP tool, IBM ILOG Cplex 1 .",
        "Firstly, for each tuple t and one of its candidate relations r, we define a binary decision variable d r t indicating whether the candidate relation r is selected by the solver.",
        "Our objective is to maximize the total confidence of all the selected candidates, and the objective function can be written as: max ?",

        "?t,r?R t ,m?M r t maxMEscore(m, r)d r t where conf(t, r) is the confidence of the tuple t bearing the candidate relation r. The first component is the sum of the original confidence scores of all the selected candidates, and the second one is the sum of the maximal mention-level confidence scores of all the selected candidates.",
        "The latter is designed to encourage the model to select the candidates with higher individual mention-level confidence scores.",
        "We add the constraints with respect to the disagreements described in Section 3.2.",
        "For the sake of clarity, we describe the constraints derived from each scenario of the two categories of disagreements separately.",
        "The subject-relation constraints avoid the disagreements between the predictions of two tuples 1 www.cplex.com sharing a subject.",
