        "An example accounting for the basic but practical assumption is illustrated in Figure 1, in which we know that the two entities (<Barack Obama, U.S.>) are not only involved in the relation instances 8 coming from knowledge bases (President-of(Barack Obama, U.S.) and Born-in(Barack Obama, U.S.)), 3 http://wordnet.princeton.edu 4 http://www.freebase.com 5 http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/yago-naga/yago 6 http://www.wikipedia.org 7 http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T19 8 According to convention, we regard a structured triple r(e i , e j ) as a relation instance which is composed of a pair of entities <e i , e j >and a relation name r with respect to them.",

        "We extract diverse textual features from all those relation mentions and combine them into a rich feature vector labeled by the relation names (President-of and Born-in) to produce a weak training corpus for relation classification.",
        "This paradigm is promising to generate large-scale training corpora automatically.",
        "However, it comes up against three technical challeges: ?",
        "Sparse features.",
        "As we cannot tell what kinds of features are effective in advance, we have to use NLP toolkits, such as Stanford CoreNLP 10 , to extract a variety of textual fea-tures, e.g., named entity tags, part-of-speech tags and lexicalized dependency paths.",
        "Un-fortunately, most of them appear only once in the training corpus, and hence leading to very sparse features.",
        "?",
        "Noisy features.",
        "Not all relation mentions express the corresponding relation instances.",
        "For example, the second relation mention in Figure 1 does not explicitly describe any relation instance, so features extracted from this sentence can be noisy.",
        "Such analogous cases commonly exist in feature extraction.",
        "?",
        "Incomplete labels.",
        "Similar to noisy fea-9 The sentences that contain the given entity pair are called relation mentions.",
        "10 http://nlp.stanford.edu/downloads/corenlp.shtml tures, the generated labels can be incomplete.",
        "For example, the fourth relation mention in Figure 1 should have been labeled by the relation Senate-of.",
        "However, the incomplete knowledge base does not contain the corresponding relation instance (Senate-of(Barack Obama, U.S.)).",
        "Therefore, the distant supervision paradigm may generate incomplete labeling corpora.",
        "In essence, distantly supervised relation extraction is an incomplete multi-label classification task with sparse and noisy features.",
        "In this paper, we formulate the relation-extraction task from a novel perspective of using matrix completion with low rank criterion.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply this technique on relation extraction with distant supervision.",
        "More specifically, as shown in Figure 2, we model the task with a sparse matrix whose rows present items (entity pairs) and columns contain noisy textual features and incomplete relation labels.",
        "In such a way, relation classification is transformed into a problem of completing the unknown labels for testing items in the sparse matrix that concatenates training and testing textual features with training labels, based on the assumption that the item-by-feature and item-by-label joint matrix is of low rank.",
        "The rationale of this assumption is that noisy features and incomplete labels are semantically correlated.",
        "The low-rank factorization of the sparse feature-label matrix delivers the low-dimensional representation of de-correlation for features and labels.",
        "840 We contribute two optimization models, DRMC 11 -b and DRMC-1, aiming at exploiting the sparsity to recover the underlying low-rank matrix and to complete the unknown testing labels simultaneously.",
        "Moreover, the logistic cost function is integrated in our models to reduce the influence of noisy features and incomplete labels, due to that it is suitable for binary variables.",
        "We also modify the fixed point continuation (FPC) algorithm (Ma et al., 2011) to find the global optimum.",
        "Experiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate that our noise-tolerant approaches outperform the baseline and the state-of-the-art methods.",
        "Furthermore, we discuss the influence of feature sparsity, and our approaches consistently achieve better performance than compared methods under different sparsity degrees.",
        "2 Related Work The idea of distant supervision was firstly proposed in the field of bioinformatics (Craven and Kumlien, 1999).",
        "Snow et al. (2004) used WordNet as the knowledge base to discover more h-pyernym/hyponym relations between entities from news articles.",
        "However, either bioinformatic database or WordNet is maintained by a few ex-perts, thus hardly kept up-to-date.",
        "As we are stepping into the big data era, the explosion of unstructured Web texts simulates us to build more powerful models that can automatically extract relation instances from large-scale online natural language corpora without hand-labeled annotation.",

        "The basic alignment assumption of this work is that if a pair of entities participate in a relation, all sentences that mention these entities are labeled by that relation name.",
        "Then we can extract a variety of textual features and learn a multi-class logistic regression classifier.",
        "Inspired by multi-instance learning (Maron and Lozano-P?erez, 1998), Riedel et al. (2010) relaxed the strong assumption and replaced all sentences with at least one sentence.",

        "They extend-11 It is the abbreviation for Distant supervision for Relation extraction with Matrix Completion ed the multi-instance learning framework (Riedel et al., 2010) to the multi-label circumstance.",
        "Surdeanu et al. (2012) proposed a novel approach to multi-instance multi-label learning for relation ex-traction, which jointly modeled all the sentences in texts and all labels in knowledge bases for a given entity pair.",
        "Other literatures (Takamatsu et al., 2012; Min et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2013) addressed more specific issues, like how to construct the negative class in learning or how to adopt more information, such as name entity tags, to improve the performance.",
        "Our work is more relevant to Riedel et al.'s (2013) which considered the task as a matrix factorization problem.",
        "Their approach is composed of several models, such as PCA (Collins et al., 2001) and collaborative filtering (Koren, 2008).",
        "However, they did not concern about the data noise brought by the basic assumption of distant supervision.",

        "The breakthrough work on this topic was made by Cand`es and Recht (2009) who proved that most low-rank matrices can be perfectly recovered from an incomplete set of entries.",
