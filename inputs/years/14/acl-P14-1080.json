        "Considering that ijw commonly appears at the beginning of the target translation of a source semantic span such as ?which ?",
        "?, namely, the left-frontier phrases, we focus only on the left-frontier phrases when training this model.",
        "Note that if there exists a target word before a left frontier, and this word is aligned to NULL, we will expand the left frontier to this word.",
        "The expansion process will be repeated until there is no such word.",
        "For example, if we take the CSS and the alignment in Figure 3(a) for training, the left frontier of the second child will be expanded from ?growing?",
        "to ?and?.",
        "In addition, taking the tri-gram left-frontier phrase for example, we can obtain a training sample such as ijw = and growing public, R=parallel, RP = E. By learning such probabilities for different transitional expressions conditioned on different relationships, we are able to capture the inner connection between the source CSS and the projected target cohesive phrases.",
        "Thus, during de-coding, if we add the probability generated by the transfer model of ( | )P CSSw as a feature in 853 formula (3), it will certainly contribute to selecting more cohesive candidates.",
        "3.3 Elementary-Unit Cohesion Constraint As mentioned in Section 3.2, in the transfer model, the transitional phrases are expected to occur at the left frontier of a projected span on target side.",
        "In fact, this depends on the assumption that the projected translations of any two disjoint source semantic spans are also disjoint to keep their own semantic integrity.",
        "We call this assumption the integrity assumption.",
        "This assumption is intuitive and supported by statistics.",
        "After analyzing 1,007 golden aligned Chinese-English sentence-pairs, we find that approximately 90% of the pairs comply with the assumption.",
        "However, in real automatically aligned noisy data, the ratio of complying pairs reduces to 71%4.",
        "Two projected translations that violate the integrity assumption may mutually overlap, which causes our confusion on where to extract the transitional phrases.",
        "In this case, extracted transitional phrases are likely to be wrong.",
        "To increase the chance of extracting correct transitional phrases, the alignment results must be modified to reduce the impact of incorrect alignment.",
        "We propose a dynamic cleaning method to ensure that the most expressive transitional phrases fall in the accessible extraction range before training the transfer model.",
        "3.3.1 EUC and non-EUC As we have defined in Section 2, the minimal semantic span is called elementary unit (eu).",
        "If the source eu and its projected target span comply with the integrity assumption, we say that such an eu and its projected span have Elementary-Unit-Cohesion (EUC).",
        "We define EUC formally as follows.",
        "Given two elementary units Aeu and Beu , and their projected target spans Aps and Bps bound by the word alignment, the alignment complies with EUC only if there is no overlap between Aps and Bps .",
        "Otherwise, the alignment is called non-EUC.",
