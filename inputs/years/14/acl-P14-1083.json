        "In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning and evaluation in statistical machine translation (SMT) that borrows ideas from response-based learning for grounded semantic parsing.",
        "In this framework, the meaning of a sentence is defined in the context of an extrinsic task.",
        "Successful communication of meaning is measured by a successful interaction in this task, and feedback from this interaction is used for learning.",
        "We suggest that in a similar way the preservation of meaning in machine translation should be defined in the context of an interaction in an extrinsic task.",
        "For example, in the context of a game, a description of a game rule is translated successfully if correct game moves can be performed based only on the translation.",
        "In the context of a question-answering scenario, a question is translated successfully if the correct answer is returned based only on the translation of the query.",
        "We propose a framework of response-based learning that allows to extract supervision signals for structured learning from the response of an extrinsic task to a translation input.",
        "Here, learning proceeds by ?trying out?",
        "translation hypothe-ses, receiving a response from interacting in the task, and converting this response into a supervision signal for updating model parameters.",
        "In case of positive feedback, the predicted translation can be treated as reference translation for a structured learning update.",
        "In case of negative feedback, a structural update can be performed against translations that have been approved previously by positive task feedback.",
        "This framework has several advantages: ?",
        "The supervision signal in response-based learning has a different quality than supervision by human-generated reference translations.",
        "While a human reference translation is generated independently of the SMT task, conversion of predicted translations into references is always done with respect to a specific task.",
        "In this sense we speak of grounding meaning transfer in an extrinsic task.",
        "?",
        "Response-based learning can repeatedly try out system predictions by interacting in the extrinsic task.",
        "Instead of and in addition to learning from human reference transla-tions, response-based learning allows to convert multiple system translations into references.",
        "This alleviates the supervision problem in cases where parallel data are scarce.",
        "?",
        "Task-specific response acts upon system translations.",
        "This avoids the problem of un-reachability of independently generated reference translations by the SMT system.",
        "The proposed approach of response-based learning opens the doors for various extrinsic tasks 881 in which SMT systems can be trained and evaluated.",
        "In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept experiment that uses feedback from a simulated world environment.",
        "Building on prior work in grounded semantic parsing, we generate translations of queries, and receive feedback by executing semantic parses of translated queries against the database.",
        "Successful response is defined as receiving the same answer from the semantic parses for the translation and the original query.",
        "Our experimental results show an improvement of about 6 points in F1-score for response-based learning over standard structured learning from reference translations.",
        "We show in an error analysis that this improvement can be attributed to using structural and lexical variants of reference translations as positive examples in response-based learning.",
        "Furthermore, translations produced by response-based learning are found to be grammatical.",
        "This is due to the possibility to boost similarity to human reference translations by the additional use of a cost function in our approach.",
        "2 Related Work The key idea of grounded language learning is to study natural language in the context of a non-linguistic environment, in which meaning is grounded in perception and/or action.",
        "This presents an analogy to human learning, where a learner tests her understanding in an actionable setting.",
        "Such a setting can be a simulated world environment in which the linguistic representation can be directly executed by a computer system.",
        "For example, in semantic parsing, the learning goal is to produce and successfully execute a meaning representation.",
        "Executable system actions include access to databases such as the GEOQUERY database on U.S. geography (Wong and Mooney (2006), inter alia), the ATIS travel planning database (Zettlemoyer and Collins (2009), inter alia), robotic control in simulated navigation tasks (Chen and Mooney (2011), inter alia), databases of simulated card games (Goldwasser and Roth (2013), inter alia), or the user-generated contents of FREEBASE (Cai and Yates (2013), inter alia).",
        "Since there are many possible correct parses, matching against a single gold standard falls short of grounding in a non-linguistic environment.",
        "Rather, the semantic context for inter-pretation, as well as the success criterion in evaluation is defined by successful execution of an action in the extrinsic environment, e.g., by receiving the correct answer from the database or by successful navigation to the destination.",
        "Recent attempts to learn semantic parsing from question-answer pairs without recurring to annotated logical forms have been presented by Kwiatowski et al. (2013), Berant et al. (2013), or Goldwasser and Roth (2013).",
        "The algorithms presented in these works are variants of structured prediction that take executability of semantic parses into account.",
        "Our work builds upon these ideas, however, to our knowledge the presented work is the first to embed translations into grounded scenarios in order to use feedback from interactions in these scenarios for structured learning in SMT.",
        "A recent important research direction in SMT has focused on employing automated translation as an aid to human translators.",
        "Computer assisted translation (CAT) subsumes several modes of interaction, ranging from binary feedback on the quality of the system prediction (Saluja et al., 2012), to human post-editing operations on a system prediction resulting in a reference translation (Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2008), to human acceptance or overriding of sentence completion predictions (Langlais et al., 2000; Barrachina et al., 2008; Koehn and Haddow, 2009).",
        "In all interaction scenarios, it is important that the system learns dynamically from its errors in order to offer the user the experience of a system that adapts to the provided feedback.",
        "Since retraining the SMT model after each interaction is too costly, online adaptation after each interaction has become the learning protocol of choice for CAT.",
        "Online learning has been applied in generative SMT, e.g., using incremental versions of the EM algorithm (Ortiz-Mart?",
        "?nez et al., 2010; Hardt and Elm-ing, 2010), or in discriminative SMT, e.g., using perceptron-type algorithms (Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2008; Mart?",
        "?nez-G?omez et al., 2012; W?aschle et al., 2013; Denkowski et al., 2014).",
        "In a similar way to deploying human feedback, extrinsic loss functions have been used to provide learning signals for SMT.",
        "For example, Nikoulina et al. (2012) propose a setup where an SMT system feeds into cross-language information retrieval, and receives feedback from the performance of translated queries with respect to cross-language retrieval performance.",
        "This feedback is used to train a reranker on an n-best list of translations order with respect to retrieval performance.",
        "In con-882 Figure 1: Response-based learning cycle for grounding SMT in virtual trivia gameplay.",
        "trast to our work, all mentioned approaches to interactive or adaptive learning in SMT rely on human post-edits or human reference translations.",
        "Our work differs from these approaches in that exactly this dependency is alleviated by learning from responses in an extrinsic task.",
        "Interactive scenarios have been used for evaluation purposes of translation systems for nearly 50 years, especially using human reading comprehension testing (Pfafflin, 1965; Fuji, 1999; Jones et al., 2005), and more recently, using face-to-face conversation mediated via machine translation (Sakamoto et al., 2013).",
        "However, despite offering direct and reliable prediction of translation quality, the cost and lack of reusability has confined task-based evaluations involving humans to testing scenarios, but prevented a use for interactive training of SMT systems as in our work.",
        "Lastly, our work is related to cross-lingual natural language processing such as cross-lingual question answering or cross-lingual information retrieval as conducted at recent evaluation campaigns of the CLEF initiative.",
        "1 While these approaches focus on improvements of the respective natural language processing task, our goal is to improve SMT by gathering feedback from the task.",
        "1 http://www.clef-initiative.eu 3 Grounding SMT in Semantic Parsing In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept of our ideas of embedding SMT into simulated world environments as used in semantic parsing.",
        "We use the well-known GEOQUERY database on U.S. geography for this purpose.",
        "Embedding SMT in a semantic parsing scenario means to define translation quality by the ability of a semantic parser to construct a meaning representation from the translated query, which returns the correct answer when executed against the database.",
        "If viewed as simulated gameplay, a valid game move in this scenario returns the correct answer to a translated query.",
        "The diagram in Figure 1 gives a sketch of response-based learning from semantic parsing in the geographical domain.",
        "Given a manual German translation of the English query as source sen-tence, the SMT system produces an English target translation.",
        "This sentence is fed into a semantic parser that produces an executable parse representation p h .",
        "Feedback is generated by executing the parse against the database of geographical facts.",
        "Positive feedback means that the correct answer is received, i.e., exec(p g ) ?",
        "= exec(p h ) indicates that the same answer is received from the gold standard parse p g and the parse for the hypothesis translation p h ; negative feedback results in case a different or no answer is received.",
        "The key advantage of response-based learning 883 is the possibility to receive positive feedback even from predictions that differ from gold standard reference translations, but yet receive the correct answer when parsed and matched against the database.",
        "Such structural and lexical variation broadens the learning capabilities in contrast to learning from fixed labeled data.",
        "For example, assume the following English query in the geographical domain, and assume positive feedback from executing the corresponding semantic parse against the geographical database: Name prominent elevations in the USA The manual translation of the English original reads Nenne prominente Erhebungen in den USA An automatic translation 2 of the German string produces the result Give prominent surveys in the US This translation will trigger negative task-based feedback: A comparison with the original allows the error to be traced back to the ambiguity of the German word Erhebung.",
        "Choosing a general domain translation instead of a translation appropriate for the geographical domain hinders the construction of a semantic parse that returns the correct answer from the database.",
        "An alternative translation might look as follows: Give prominent heights in the US Despite a large difference to the original English string, key terms such as elevations and heights, or USA and US, can be mapped into the same predicate in the semantic parse, thus allowing to receive positive feedback from parse execution against the geographical database.",

        "How-ever, the result differences between these two systems do not score as statistically significant.",

        "Our error analysis shows that response-based learning generates grammatical translations which is due to the additional use of a cost function that boosts similarity of translations to human reference translations.",
