        "For example, the reaction sentence, ?President Clinton vowed to track down the perpetrators behind the bombs that exploded outside the embassies in Tanzania and Kenya on Friday,?",
        "would have a higher score than the action sentence, ?Bombs exploded outside the embassies in Tanzania and Kenya on Friday.?",
        "This problem occurs because the first sentence has a higher ROUGE score (it covers more important words than the second sentence).",

        "4.2 Redundancy We identify redundant sentences using a linear regression classifier trained on a manually la-beled subset of the DUC?03 sentences.",
        "The features include shared noun counts, sentence length, TF*IDF cosine similarity, timestamp difference, and features drawn from information extraction such as number of shared tuples in Open IE (Mausam et al., 2012).",
        "905 4.3 Summary Coherence We require two types of coherence: coherence between the parent and child summaries and coherence within each summary X i .",
        "We rely on the approximate discourse graph (ADG) that was proposed in (Christensen et al., 2013) as the basis for measuring coherence.",
        "Each node in the ADG is a sentence from the dataset.",
        "An edge from sentence s i to s j with positive weight indicates that s j may follow s i in a coherent summary, e.g. continued mention of an event or entity, or coreference link between s i and s j .",

Intra-cluster Coherence: In traditional MDS, the documents are usually quite focused, allowing for highly focused summaries.",

        "5.1 User Preference In our first experiment, we simply wished to evaluate which system users most prefer.",
        "We hired Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) workers and assigned two topics to each worker.",
        "We paired up workers such that one worker would see output from SUMMA for the first topic and a competing system for the second and the other worker would see the reverse.",
        "For quality control, we asked workers to complete a qualification task first, in which they were required to write a short summary of a news article.",
        "We also manually removed spam from our results.",

        "Some also explained that it was easier to remember information when presented with the overview first.",
        "Typical responses included, ?Could gather and absorb the information at my own pace,?",

        "When users preferred the timelines, they usually remarked that it was more familiar, i.e. ?I liked the familiarity of the format.",
        "I am used to these timelines and they feel comfortable.?",
        "Users complained that the flat summaries were disjointed, confusing, and very frustrating to read.",
        "5.2 Knowledge Acquisition Evaluating how much a user learned is inherently difficult, more so when the goal is to allow the user the freedom to explore information based on individual interest.",
        "For this reason, instead of asking a set of predefined questions, we assess the knowl-907 edge gain by following the methodology of (Sha- haf et al., 2012) ?",

        "Using the same setup as in the previous exper-iment, for each topic, five AMT workers spent three minutes reading through a timeline or summary and were then asked to write a description of what they had learned.",

        "For each pair of descrip-tions, four workers evaluated the pair.",

        "Prefer SUMMA 58% 17% TIMELINE 25% SUMMA 40% 22% FLAT-MDS 38% Descriptions written by workers using SUMMA were preferred over twice as often as those from timelines.",
        "We looked more closely at those cases where the participants either preferred the timelines or were indifferent and found that this preference was most common when the topic was not dominated by a few major events, but was instead a series of similarly important events.",
        "For exam-ple, in the kidnapping and beheading of Daniel Pearl there were two or three obviously major events, whereas in the Kargil War there were many smaller important events.",
        "In latter cases, the hierarchical summaries provided little advantage over the timelines because it was more difficult to arrange the sentences hierarchically.",
        "Since SUMMA was judged to be so much superior to flat MDS systems in Section 5.1, it is surprising that users descriptions from flat MDS were preferred nearly as often as those from SUMMA.",
        "While the flat summaries were disjointed, they were good at including salient information, with the most salient tending to be near the start of the summary.",
        "Thus, descriptions from both SUMMA and flat MDS generally covered the most salient information.",
        "5.3 Informativeness In this experiment, we assess the salience of the information captured by the different systems, and the ability of SUMMA to organize the information so that more important information is placed at higher levels.",
        "ROUGE Evaluation: We first automatically assessed informativeness by calculating the ROUGE-1 scores of the output of each of the systems.",
        "For the gold standard comparison summary, we use the Wikipedia articles for the topics.",
        "5 Note that there is no good translation of ROUGE for hierarchical summarization.",
        "Thus, we simply use the traditional ROUGE metric, which will not capture any of the hierarchical format.",
        "This score will essentially serve as a rough measure of coverage of the entire summary to the Wikipedia article.",
        "The scores for each of the systems are as follows: P R F1 SUMMA 0.25 0.67 0.31 TIMELINE 0.28 0.65 0.33 FLAT-MDS 0.30 0.64 0.34 None of the differences are significant.",
        "From this evaluation, one can gather that the systems have similar coverage of the Wikipedia articles.",
        "Manual Evaluation: While ROUGE serves as a rough measure of coverage, we were interested in gathering more fine-grained information on the informativeness of each system.",
        "We performed an additional manual evaluation that assesses the recall of important events for each system.",
        "We first identified which events were most important in a news story.",
        "Because reading 300 articles per topic is impractical, we asked AMT workers to read a Wikipedia article on the same topic and then identify the three most important events and the five most important secondary events.",
        "We aggregated responses from ten workers per topic and chose the three most common primary and five most common secondary events.",
        "One of the authors then manually identified the presence of these events in the hierarchical sum-maries, the timelines and the flat MDS summaries.",
        "Below we show event recall (the percentage of the events that were mentioned).",
        "5 We excluded one topic (the handover of the Lockerbie bombing suspects) because the corresponding Wikipedia article had insufficient information.",
        "908 Events SUMMA TIMELINE FLAT-MDS Prim.",
        "96% 74% 93% Sec.",
        "76% 53% 64% The difference in recall between SUMMA and TIMELINE was significant in both cases, and the difference between SUMMA and FLAT-MDS was not.",
        "In general, the flat summaries were quite re-dundant, which contributed to the slightly lower event recall.",
        "The timelines, on the other hand, were both incoherent and at the same time reported less important facts.",
        "We also evaluated at what level in the hierarchy the events were identified for the hierarchical summaries.",
        "The event recall shows the percentage of events mentioned at that level or above in the hierarchical summary: Events Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Prim.",
        "63% 81% 96% Sec.",
        "27% 51% 76% 81% of the primary events are present in the first or second level, and 76% of the secondary events are mentioned by the third level.",
        "While recognizing primary events is relatively simple because they are repeated frequently, identification of important secondary events often requires external knowledge.",
        "5.4 Parent-to-Child Coherence We next tested the hierarchical coherence.",
        "One of the authors graded how much each non-leaf sentence in a summary was coherent with its child summary on a scale of one to five, with one being incoherent and five being perfectly coherent.",
        "We used the coherence scale from DUC?04.",
        "6 Level 1 Level 2 Coherence 3.8 3.4 We found that for the top level of the summary, the parent sentence generally represented the most important event in the cluster and the child summary usually expressed details or reactions of the event.",
        "The lower coherence scores were often the result of too few lexical connections or lack of a theme or story.",
        "While the facts of the sentences made sense together, the summaries sometimes did not read as if they were written by a human, but as a series of disparate sentences.",
        "For the second level, the problems were more basic.",
        "The parent sentence occasionally expressed a less important fact that the child summary did 6 http://duc.nist.gov/duc2004/quality.questions.txt not then expand on or, more commonly, the child summary was not focused enough.",
        "This result stems from two problems in our algorithm.",
        "First, summarizing sentences are rare, making good choices for parent sentences difficult to find.",
        "The second problem relates to the difficulty in identifying whether two sentences are on the same topic.",
        "For example, suppose the parent sentence is, ?A Swissair plane Wednesday night crashed off Nova Scotia, Canada.?",
        "A very good child sentence is, ?The airline confirmed that all passengers died.?",
        "However, based on their surface features, the sen-tence, ?A plane made an unscheduled landing after a Swissair plane crashed off the coast of Canada,?",
        "appears to be a better choice.",
        "Even though there is scope for improvement, we find these coherence scores encouraging for a first algorithm for the task.",
        "6 Related Work Traditional approaches to large-scale summarization have included flat summaries and timelines.",

        "Aspects are identified either by a training corpus of articles in the 909 same domain (Sauper and Barzilay, 2009), by an entity-aspect LDA model (Li et al., 2010), or by Wikipedia templates of related topics (Yao et al., 2011).",
