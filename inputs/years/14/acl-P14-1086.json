        "In the past 10 years, the general objective of text summarization has been refined into more specific tasks.",
        "Such summarization tasks include: (i) Generic Multi Document Summarization: aims at summarizing a cluster of topically related documents, such as the top results of a search engine query; (ii) in Update Summarization, a set of documents is summarized while assuming the user has already read a summary of earlier documents on the same topic; (iii) in Query-Focused Summarization, the summary of a documents set is produced to convey an informative answer in the context of a specific query.",
        "The importance of these specialized tasks is that they help us distinguish criteria that lead to the selection of content in a summary: centrality, novelty, relevance, and techniques to avoid redundancy.",
        "We present in this paper a variant summarization task which combines the two aspects of update and query-focused summarization.",
        "The task is related to exploratory search (Marchionini, 2006).",
        "In contrast to classical information seek-ing, in exploratory search, the user is uncertain about the information available, and aims at learning and understanding a new topic (White and Roth, 2009).",
        "In typical exploratory search behavior, a user posts a series of queries, and based on information gathered at each step, decides how to further explore a set of documents.",
        "The metaphor of berrypicking introduced in (Bates, 1989) captures this interactive process.",
        "At each step, the user may zoom in to a more specific information need, zoom out to a more general query, or pan sideways, in order to investigate a new aspect of the topic.",
        "We define Query-Chain Focused Summarization as follows: for each query in an exploratory search session, we aim to extract a summary that answers the information need of the user, in a manner similar to Query-Focused Summariza-tion, while not repeating information already provided in previous steps, in a manner similar to Update Summarization.",
        "In contrast to query-focused summarization, the context of a sum-913 mary is not a single query, but the set of queries that led to the current step, their result sets and the corresponding summaries.",
        "We have constructed a novel dataset of Query-Sets with matching manual summarizations in the consumer health domain (Cline and Haynes, 2001).",
        "Queries are extracted from PubMed search logs (Dogan et al., 2009).",
        "We have ana-lyzed this manual dataset and confirm that summaries written in the context of berry-picking are markedly different from those written for similar queries on the same document set, but without the query-chain context.",
        "We have adapted well-known multi-document algorithms to the task, and present baseline algorithms based on LexRank (Erkan and Radev, 2004), KLSum and TopicSum (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009).",
        "We introduce a new algorithm to address the task of Query-Chain Focused Summarization, based on a new LDA topic model variant, and present an evaluation which demonstrates it improves on these baselines.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 formulates the task of Query-Chain Focused Summarization.",
        "Section 3 reviews related work.",
        "In Section 4, we describe the data collection process and the resulting dataset.",
        "We then present our algorithm, as well as the baseline algorithms used for evaluation.",
        "We conclude with evaluation and discussion.",
        "2 Query-Chain Summarization In this work, we focus on the zoom in aspect of the exploratory search process described above.",
        "We formulate the Query-Chain Focused Summarization (QCFS) task as follows: Given an ordered chain of queries Q and a set of documents D , for each query Qqi?",
        "a summary Si is generated from D answering iq under the assumption that the user has already read the summaries Si-1 for queries 10... ?iqq .",
        "A typical example of query chain in the consumer health domain we investigate includes the following 3 successive queries: (Causes of asth-ma, Asthma and Allergy, Asthma and Mold Al-lergy).",
        "We consider a single set of documents relevant to the domain of Asthma as the reference set D. The QCFS task consists of generating one summary of D as an answer to each que-ry, so that the successive answers do not repeat information already provided in a previous answer.",
        "3 Previous Work We first review the closely related tasks of Update Summarization and Query-Focused Summarization.",
        "We also review key summarization algorithms that we have selected as baseline and adapted to the QCFS task.",
        "Update Summarization focuses on identifying new information relative to a previous body of information, modeled as a set of documents.",
        "It has been introduced in shared tasks in DUC 2007 and TAC 2008.",
        "This task consists of producing a multi-document summary for a document set on a specific topic, and then a multi-document summary for a different set of articles on the same topic published at later dates.",
        "This task helps us understand how update summaries identified and focused on new information while reducing redundancy compared to the original summaries.",
        "The TAC 2008 dataset includes 48 sets of 20 documents, each cluster split in two subsets of 10 documents (called A and B).",
        "Subset B documents were more recent.",
        "Original summaries were generated for the A subsets and update summaries were then produced for the B subsets.",
        "Human summaries and candidate systems are evaluated using the Pyramid method (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004).",
        "For automatic evaluation, ROUGE (Lin, 2004) variants have been proposed (Conroy et al., 2011).",
        "In contrast to this setup, QCFS distinguishes the subsets of documents considered at each step of the process by facets of the underlying topic, and not by chronology.",
        "In addition, the document subsets are not identified as part of the task in QCFS (as opposed to the explicit split in A and B subsets in Update Summarization).",
        "Most systems working on Update Summarization have focused on removing redundancy.",
        "Du-alSum (Delort and Alfonseca, 2012) is notable in attempting to directly model novelty using a specialized topic-model to distinguish words expressing background information and those introducing new information in each document.",
        "In Query-Focused Summarization (QFS), the task consists of identifying information in a document set that is most relevant to a given query.",
        "914 This differs from generic summarization, where one attempts to identify central information.",
        "QFS helps us distinguish models of relevance and centrality.",
        "Unfortunately, detailed analysis of the datasets produced for QFS indicates that these two notions are not strongly distinguished in practice: (Gupta et al., 2007) observed that in QFS datasets, up to 57% of the words in the document sets were closely related to the query (through simple query expansion).",
        "They note that as a consequence, a generic summarizer forms a strong baseline for such biased QFS tasks.",
        "We address this limitation of existing QFS datasets in our definition of QCFS: we identify a chain of at least 3 related queries which focus on different facets of the same central topic and require the generation of distinct summaries for each query, with little repetition across the steps.",
        "A specific evaluation aspect of QFS measures responsiveness (how well the summary answers the specific query).",
        "QFS must rely on Information Retrieval techniques to overcome the scarceness of the query to establish relevance.",
        "As evidenced since (Daumé and Marcu, 2006), Bayesian techniques have proven effective at this task: we construct a latent topic model on the basis of the document set and the query.",
        "This topic model effectively serves as a query expansion mechanism, which helps assess the relevance of individual sentences to the original query.",
        "In recent years, three major techniques have emerged to perform multi-document summariza-tion: graph-based methods such as LexRank (Er- kan and Radev, 2004) for multi document summarization and Biased-LexRank (Otterbacher et al., 2008) for query focused summarization, language model methods such as KLSum (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009) and variants of KLSum based on topic models such as BayesSum (Dau- me and Marcu, 2006) and TopicSum (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009).",
        "LexRank is a stochastic graph-based method for computing the relative importance of textual units in a natural text.",
        "The LexRank algorithm builds a weighted graph ?",
        "= (?, ?)",
        "where each vertex in ?",
        "is a linguistic unit (in our case sen-tences) and each weighted edge in ?",
        "is a measure of similarity between the nodes.",
        "In our imple-mentation, we model similarity by computing the cosine distance between the ??",
        "?",
        "???",
        "vectors representing each node.",
        "After the graph is gener-ated, the PageRank algorithm (Page et al., 1999) is used to determine the most central linguistic units in the graph.",
        "To generate a summary we use the ?",
        "most central lexical units, until the length of the target summary is reached.",
        "This method has no explicit control to avoid redundancy among the selected sentences, and the original algorithm does not address update or query-focused variants.",
        "Biased-LexRank (Otter- bacher et al., 2008) makes LexRank sensitive to the query by introducing a prior belief about the ranking of the nodes in the graph, which reflects the similarity of sentences to the query.",
        "PageRank spreads the query similarity of a vertex to its close neighbors, so that we rank higher sentences that are similar to other sentences which are similar to the query.",
        "As a result, Biased-LexRank overcomes the lexical sparseness of the query and obtained state of the art results on the DUC 2005 dataset.",
        "KLSum adopts a language model approach to compute relevance: the documents in the input set are modeled as a distribution over words (the original algorithm uses a unigram distribution over the bag of words in documents D).",
        "KLSum is a sentence extraction algorithm: it searches for a subset of the sentences in D with a unigram distribution as similar as possible to that of the overall collection D, but with a limited length.",
        "The algorithm uses Kullback-Lieber (KL) divergence ??(?||?)",
        "= ?",
        "log?",
        "( ?(?)",
        "?(?)",

        "to compute the similarity of the distributions.",
        "It searches for ??",
        "= argmin|?|<???(??||??).",
        "This search is performed in a greedy manner, adding sentences one by one to S until the length L is reached, and choosing the best sentence as measured by KL-divergence at each step.",
        "The original method has no update or query focusing capability, but as a general modeling framework it is easy to adapt to a wide range of specific tasks.",
        "TopicSum uses an LDA-like topic model (Blei et al. 2003) to classify words from a number of document sets (each set discussing a different topic) as either general non-content words, topic specific words and document specific word (this category refers to words that are specific to the writer and not shared across the document set).",
        "After the words are classified, the algorithm uses a KLSum variant to find the summary that best matches the unigram distribution of topic specific words.",
        "This method improves the results of 915 KLSum but it also has no update summary or query answering capabilities.",
        "4 Dataset Collection We now describe how we have constructed a dataset to evaluate QCFS algorithms, which we are publishing freely.",
        "We selected to build our dataset in the Consumer Health domain, a popular domain in the web (Cline and Haynes 2001) providing medical information at various levels of complexity, ranging from layman and up to expert information, because consumer health illustrates the need for exploratory search.",
        "The PubMed repository, while primarily serving the academic community, is also used by laymen to ask health related questions.",
        "The PubMed query logs (Dogan et al., 2009) provide user queries with timestamps and anonymized user identification.",
        "They are publically available and include over 600K queries per day.",
        "In this dataset, Dogan and Murray found that query reformulation (typ- ical of exploratory search) is quite frequent: \"In our dataset, 47% of all queries are followed by a new subsequent query.",
        "These users did not select any abstract or full text views from the result set.",

        "We then asked medical students to manually produce summaries of these four document collections for each query-chain.",
        "The medical students were instructed construct a text of up to 250 words that provides a good answer to each query in the chain.",
        "For each query in a chain the summarizers should assume that the person reading the summaries is familiar with the previous 916 summaries in the chain so they should avoid redundancy.",
        "Three distinct human summaries were produced for each chain.",
        "For each chain, one summary was produced for each of the three queries, where the person producing the summary was not shown the next steps in the chain when answering the first query.",
        "To simulate the exploratory search of the user we provided the annotators with a Solr1 query interface for each document collection.",
        "The interface allowed querying the document set, reading the documents and choosing sentences which answer the query.",
        "After choosing the sentences, annotators can copy and edit the resulting summary in order to create an answer of up to 250 words.",

        "Q3: BMI Validity BMI has become controversial because many people, including physicians, have come to rely on its apparent numerical authority for medical diagnosis, but that was never the BMI's purpose; it is meant to be used as a simple means of classifying sedentary populations with an average body composition.",
