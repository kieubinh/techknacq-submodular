        "972 2007; Kwiatkowski et al., 2010; Kwiatkowski et al., 2011) require manually annotated logical forms as supervision, and are hard to extend resulting parsers from limited domains, such as GEO, JOBS and ATIS, to open domains.",
        "Recent works (Clarke and Lapata, 2010; Liang et al., 2013) have alleviated such issues using question-answer pairs as weak supervision, but still with the shortcoming of using limited lexical triggers to link NL phrases to predicates.",
        "Poon (2013) has proposed an unsupervised method by adopting grounded-learning to leverage the database for indirect supervision.",

        "Berant et al. (2013) have not only enlarged the KB used for Freebase (Google, 2013), but also used a bigger lexicon trigger set extracted by the open IE method (Lin et al., 2012) for NL phrases to predicates linking.",
        "In comparison, our method has further advantages: (1) Question answering and semantic parsing are performed in an joint way under a unified framework; (2) A robust method is proposed to map NL questions to their formal triple queries, which trades off the mapping quality by using question patterns and relation expressions in a cascaded way; and (3) We use domain independent feature set which allowing us to use a relatively small number of question-answer pairs to tune model parameters.",

        "Compared to their work, our method gains an improvement in two aspects: (1) Instead of using facts extracted using the open IE method, we leverage a large scale, high-quality knowledge base; (2) We can handle multiple-relation questions, instead of single-relation queries only, based on our translation based KB-QA framework.",

        "Since Freebase is completely contained by our KB, we disallow all entities which are not included by Freebase.",
        "By doing so, our KB provides the same knowledge as Freebase does, which means we do not gain any extra advantage by using a larger KB.",

        "We think this improvement comes from two aspects: (1) The quality of the relation expressions is better than the quality of the lexicon entries used in the baseline; and (2) We use the extraction-related statistics of relation expressions as features, which brings more information to measure the confidence of mapping between NL phrases and KB predicates, and makes the model to be more flexible.",

        "Actually, the size of our system's search space is much smaller than the one of the semantic parser used in the baseline.This is due to the fact that, if triple queries generated by the question translation component cannot derive any answer from KB, we will discard such triple queries directly during the QA procedure.",
