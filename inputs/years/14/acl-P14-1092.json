        "Driven by several international evaluations and workshops such as the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) 1 and the Cross Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF), 2 the task of question answering (QA) has received considerable attention.",
        "However, most of this effort has focused on factoid questions rather than more complex non-factoid (NF) ques-tions, such as manner, reason, or causation questions.",
        "Moreover, the vast majority of QA models explore only local linguistic structures, such as syntactic dependencies or semantic role frames, 1 http://trec.nist.gov 2 http://www.clef-initiative.eu which are generally restricted to individual sentences.",
        "This is problematic for NF QA, where questions are answered not by atomic facts, but by larger cross-sentence conceptual structures that convey the desired answers.",
        "Thus, to answer NF questions, one needs a model of what these answer structures look like.",
        "Driven by this observation, our main hypothesis is that the discourse structure of NF answers provides complementary information to state-of-the-art QA models that measure the similarity (ei- ther lexical and/or semantic) between question and answer.",
        "We propose a novel answer reranking (AR) model that combines lexical semantics (LS) with discourse information, driven by two representations of discourse: a shallow representation centered around discourse markers and surface text information, and a deep one based on the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) discourse framework (Mann and Thompson, 1988).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to systematically explore within- and cross-sentence structured discourse features for NF AR.",
        "The contributions of this work are: 1.",
        "We demonstrate that modeling discourse is greatly beneficial for NF AR for two types of NF questions, manner (?how?)",
        "and reason (?why?",
        "), across two large datasets from different genres and domains ?",
        "one from the community question-answering (CQA) site of Yahoo!",
        "Answers 3 , and one from a biology textbook.",
        "Our results show statistically significant improvements of up to 24% on top of state-of-the-art LS models (Yih et al., 2013).",
        "2.",
        "We demonstrate that both shallow and deep discourse representations are useful, and, in general, their combination performs best.",
        "3.",
        "We show that discourse-based QA models using inter-sentence features considerably out-3 http://answers.yahoo.com 977 perform single-sentence models when answers span multiple sentences.",
        "4.",
        "We demonstrate good domain transfer performance between these corpora, suggesting that answer discourse structures are largely independent of domain, and thus broadly applicable to NF QA.",
        "2 Related Work The body of work on factoid QA is too broad to be discussed here (see, e.g., the TREC workshops for an overview).",
        "However, in the context of LS, Yih et al. (2013) recently addressed the problem of answer sentence selection and demonstrated that LS models, including recurrent neural network language models (RNNLM), have a higher contribution to overall performance than exploiting syntactic analysis.",
        "We extend this work by showing that discourse models coupled with LS achieve the best performance for NF AR.",
        "The related work on NF QA is considerably more scarce, but several trends are clear.",
        "First, most NF QA approaches tend to use multiple similarity models (information retrieval or alignment) as features in discriminative rerankers (Riezler et al., 2007; Higashinaka and Isozaki, 2008; Verberne et al., 2010; Surdeanu et al., 2011).",
        "Sec-ond, and more relevant to this work, all these approaches focus either on bag-of-word representations or linguistic structures that are restricted to single sentences (e.g., syntactic dependencies, semantic roles, or standalone discourse cue phrases).",
        "Answering how questions using a single discourse marker, by, was previously explored by Prager et al. (2000), who searched for by followed by a present participle (e.g. by *ing) to elevate answer candidates in a ranking framework.",
        "Verberne et al. (2011) extracted 47 cue phrases such as because from a small collection of web documents, and used the cosine similarity between an answer candidate and a bag of words containing these cue phrases as a single feature in their reranking model for non-factoid why QA.",
        "Extending this, Oh et al. (2013) built a classifier to identify causal relations using a small set of cue phrases (e.g., because and is caused by).",
        "This classifier was then used to extract instances of causal relations in answer candidates, which were turned into features in a reranking model for Japanense why QA.",
        "In terms of discourse parsing, Verberne et al. (2007) conducted an initial evaluation of the utility of RST structures to why QA by evaluating Figure 1: Architecture of the reranking framework for QA.",
        "performance on a small sample of seven WSJ articles drawn from the RST Treebank (Carlson et al., 2003).",
        "They later concluded that while discourse parsing appears to be useful for QA, automated discourse parsing tools are required before this approach can be tested at scale (Verberne et al., 2010).",
        "Inspired by this previous work and recent work in discourse parsing (Feng and Hirst, 2012), our work is the first to systematically explore structured discourse features driven by several discourse representations, combine discourse with lexical semantic models, and evaluate these representations on thousands of questions using both in-domain and cross-domain experiments.",
        "3 Approach The proposed answer reranking component is embedded in the QA framework illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "This framework functions in two distinct sce-narios, which use the same AR model, but differ in the way candidate answers are retrieved: CQA: In this scenario, the task is defined as reranking all the user-posted answers for a particular question to boost the community-selected best answer to the top position.",
        "This is a commonly used setup in the CQA community (Wang et al., 2009).",
        "4 Thus, for a given question, all its answers are fetched from the answer collection, and an initial ranking is constructed based on the cosine similarity between theirs and the question's lemma vector representations, with lemmas weighted using tf.idf (Ch.",
        "6, (Manning et al., 2008)).",
        "4 Although most of these works use shallow textual features and focus mostly on meta data, e.g., number of votes for a particular answer.",
        "Here we use no meta data and rely solely on linguistic features.",
        "978 Traditional QA: In this scenario answers are dynamically constructed from larger documents (Pasca, 2001).",
        "We use this setup to answer questions from a biology textbook, where each section is indexed as a standalone document, and each paragraph in a given document is considered as a candidate answer.",
        "We implemented the document indexing and retrieval stage using Lucene 5 .",
        "The candidate answers are scored using a linear interpolation of two cosine similarity scores: one between the entire parent document and question (to model global context), and a second between the answer candidate and question (for local context).",
        "6 Because the number of answer candidates is typically large (e.g., equal to the number of paragraphs in the textbook), we return the N top candidates with the highest scores.",
        "These answer candidates are then passed to the answer reranking component, the focus of this work.",
        "AR analyzes the candidates using more expensive techniques to extract discourse and LS features (detailed in ?4), and these features are then used in concert with a learning framework to rerank the candidates and elevate correct answers to higher positions.",
        "For the learning framework, we used SVM rank , a variant of Support Vector Machines for structured output adapted to ranking problems.",
        "7 In addition to these features, each reranker also includes a single feature containing the score of each candidate, as computed by the above candidate retrieval (CR) component.",
        "8 4 Models and Features We propose two separate discourse representation schemes ?",
        "one shallow, centered around discourse markers, and one deep, based on RST.",
        "4.1 Discourse Marker Model The discourse marker model (DMM) extracts cross-sentence discourse structures centered around a discourse marker.",
        "This extraction process is illustrated in the top part of Figure 2.",
        "These structures are represented using three components: (1) A discourse marker from Daniel Marcu's list 5 http://lucene.apache.org 6 We empirically observed that this combination of scores performs better than using solely the cosine similarity between the answer and question.",
        "7 http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/ svm_light/svm_rank.html 8 Including these scores as features in the reranker model is a common strategy that ensures that the reranker takes advantage of the analysis already performed by the CR model.",
        "(see Appendix B in Marcu (1997)), that serves as a divisive boundary between sentences.",
        "Examples of these markers include and, in, that, for, if, as, not, by, and but; (2) two marker arguments, i.e., text segments before and after the marker, labeled to indicate if they are related to the question text or not; and (3) a sentence range around the marker, which defines the length of these segments (e.g., ?2 sentences).",
        "For example, a marker feature may take the form of: QSEG BY OTHER SR2, which means that the the marker by has been detected in an answer candidate.",
        "Further, the text preceeding by matches text from the question (and is therefore labeled QSEG), while the text after by differs considerably from the question text, and is labeled OTHER.",
        "In this particular example, the scope of this similarity matching occurs over a span of ?2 sentences around the marker.",
        "Note that our marker arguments are akin to EDUs in RST, but, in this shallow representa-tion, they are simply constructed around discourse markers and bound by an arbitrary sentence range.",
        "Argument Labels: We label marker arguments based on their similarity to question content.",
        "If text before or after a marker out to a given sentence range matches the entire text of the question (with a cosine similarity score larger than a threshold), that argument takes on the label QSEG, or OTHER otherwise.",
        "In this way the features are only partially lexicalized with the discourse markers.",
        "Argument labels indicate only if lemmas from the question were found in a discourse structure present in an answer candidate, and do not speak to the specific lemmas that were found.",
        "We show in ?5 that these lightly lexicalized features perform well in domain and transfer between domains.",
        "We explore other argument labeling strategies in ?5.7.",
        "Feature Values: Our reranking framework uses real-valued features.",
        "The values of the discourse features are the mean of the similarity scores (e.g., cosine similarity using tf.idf weighting) of the two marker arguments and the corresponding question.",
        "For example, the value of the QSEG BY QSEG SR1 feature in Figure 2 is the average of the cosine similarities of the question text with the answer texts before/after by out to a distance of one sentence before/after the marker.",
        "It is important to note that these discourse features are more expressive than features based on discourse markers alone (Higashinaka and Isozaki, 2008; Verberne et al., 2010).",
        "First, 979 Figure 2: Top: Example feature generation for the discourse marker model, for one question (Q) and one answer candidate (AC).",
        "Answer candidates are searched for discourse markers (italic) and question word matches (bold), which are used to generate features both within-sentence (SR0), and ?1 sentence (SR1).",
        "The actual DMM exhaustively generates features for all markers and all sentence ranges.",
        "Here we show just a few for brevity.",
        "Bottom: Example feature generation for the discourse parser model using the output of an actual discourse parser.",
        "The DPM creates one feature for each individual discourse relation.",
        "the argument sequences used here capture cross-sentence discourse structures.",
        "Second, these features model the intensity of the match between the text surrounding the discourse structure and the question text using both the assigned argument labels and the feature values.",
        "4.2 Discourse Parser Model The discourse parser model (DPM) is based on the RST discourse framework (Mann and Thompson, 1988).",
        "In RST, the text is segmented into a sequence of non-overlapping fragments called elementary discourse units (EDUs), and binary discourse relations recursively connect neighboring units.",
        "Most relations are hypotactic, where one of the units in the relation (the nucleus) is considered more important than the other (the satellite).",
        "A few relations are paratactic, where both participants have equal importance.",
        "In the bottom part of Figure 2, we show hypotactic relations as directed arrows, from the nucleus to the satellite.",
        "In this work, we construct the RST discourse trees using the parser of Feng and Hirst (2012).",
        "Relying on a proper discourse framework facilitates the modeling of the numerous implicit relations that are not driven by discourse markers (see Ch.",
        "21 in Jurafsky and Martin (2009)).",
        "How-ever, this also introduces noise because discourse analysis is a complex task and discourse parsers are not perfect.",
        "To mitigate this, we used a simple feature generation strategy, which creates one feature for each individual discourse relation by concatenating the relation type with the labels of the discourse units participating in it.",
        "To this end, for every relation, we extract the entire text dominated by each of its arguments, and we generate labels for the two participants in the relation using the same strategy as the DMM (based on the similarity with the question content).",
        "Similar to the DMM, these features take real values obtained by averaging the cosine similarity of the arguments with the question content.",
        "9 Fig. 2 shows several such features, created around two RST Elaboration relations, indicating that the latter sentences expand on the information at the beginning of the answer.",
        "Other common relations include Attribution, Contrast, Background, and Evaluation.",
        "4.3 Lexical Semantics Model Inspired by the work of Yih et al. (2013), we include lexical semantics in our reranking model.",
        "Several of their proposed models rely on proprietary data; here we focus on LS models that rely on open-source data and frameworks.",
        "In particu-lar, we use the recurrent neural network language model (RNNLM) of Mikolov et al. (2013; 2010).",
        "Like any language model, a RNNLM estimates the probability of observing a word given the preceding context, but, in this process, it learns word embeddings into a latent, conceptual space with a fixed number of dimensions.",
        "Consequently, related words tend to have vectors that are close to each other in this space.",
        "We derive two LS measures from these vec-tors, which are then are included as features in the reranker.",
        "The first is a measure of the overall LS similarity of the question and answer can-9 We investigated more complex features, e.g., by exploring depths of two and three in the discourse tree, and also models that relied on tree kernels over these trees, but none improved upon this simple representation.",
        "This suggests that, in the domains explored here, there is a degree of noise introduced by the discourse parser, and the simple features proposed here are the best strategy to avoid overfitting on it.",
        "980 didate, which is computed as the cosine similarity between the two composite vectors of the question and the answer candidate.",
        "These composite vectors are assembled by summing the vectors for individual question (or answer candidate) words, and re-normalizing this composite vector to unit length.",
        "Both this overall similarity score, as well as the average pairwise cosine similarity between each word in the question and answer candidate, serve as features.",
        "5 Experiments 5.1 Data To test the utility of our approach, we experimented with the two QA scenarios introduced in ?3 using the following two datasets: Yahoo!",
        "Answers Corpus (YA): Yahoo!",
        "Answers 10 is an open domain community-generated QA site, with questions and answers that span formal and precise to informal and ambiguous language.",
        "Due to the speed limitations of the discourse parser, we randomly drew 10,000 QA pairs from the corpus of how questions described by Surdeanu et al. (2011) using their filtering crite-ria, with the additional criterion that answers had to contain at least four community-generated an-swers, one of which was voted as the top answer.",

        "The entire biology text (at paragraph granularity) serves as the possible set of answers.",
        "Note that while our system retrieves answers at paragraph granularity, the expert was not constrained in any way during the annotation pro-cess, so gold answers might be smaller than a paragraph or span multiple paragraphs.",

        "The setup in this paper, commonly used in the CQA community (Wang et al., 2009), is more relevant here because it includes both high and low quality answers.",
