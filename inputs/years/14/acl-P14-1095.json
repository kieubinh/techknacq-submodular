        "This paper introduces FactChecker, language-aware approach to truth-finding.",
        "FactChecker differs from prior approaches in that it does not rely on iterative peer voting, instead it leverages language to infer believability of fact candidates.",
        "In particular, FactChecker makes use of linguistic features to detect if a given source objectively states facts or is speculative and opinionated.",
        "To ensure that fact candidates mentioned in similar sources have similar believability, FactChecker augments objectivity with a co-mention score to compute the overall believability score of a fact candidate.",
        "Our experiments on various datasets show that FactChecker yields higher accuracy than existing approaches."

        "Truth-finding algorithms aim to separate true statements (facts) from false information.",
        "More specifically, given a set of statements whose truthfulness is unknown (fact candidates), the key goal of truth-finding algorithms is to generate a ranking such that true statements are ranked ahead of false ones.",
        "Truth-finders have the potential to address a major obstacle on the Web: the problem of sources spreading inaccurate and conflicting information.",
        "This problem continues to grow with the development of tools for easy Web authorship.",
        "Blogs, forums and social networking websites are not subject to traditional journalistic standards.",
        "Conse-quently, the accuracy of information reported by these sources is often unclear.",
        "Even more established newspapers and websites may sometimes report false information as they race to break stories.",
        "Therefore, truth-finding is becoming an increasingly important problem.",
        "Information extraction projects aim to distill relational facts from natural language text (Auer et al., 2007; Bollacker et al., 2008; Carlson et al., 2010; Fader et al., 2011; Nakashole et al., 2011; Del Corro and Gemulla, 2013).",
        "These projects have produced knowledge bases containing many millions of relational facts between entities.",
        "However, despite these impressive advances, there are still major limitations regarding precision.",
        "Within the context of information extraction, fact extractors assign confidence scores to extracted facts.",
        "However, such scores are often tied to the extractor's ability to read and understand natural language text.",
        "This is different from a score that indicates the degree to which a given fact candidate is believable.",
        "Such a believability score is sometimes also referred to as a credibility score or truthfulness score.",
        "The believability score reflects the likelihood that a given statement is true.",
        "Truth-finding algorithms aim to compute this score for each fact candidate.",
        "Prior truth-finding methods are mostly based on iterative voting, where votes are propagated from sources to fact candidates and then back to sources (Yin et al., 2007; Galland et al., 2010; Pasternack and Roth, 2010; Li et al., 2011; Yin and Tan, 2011).",
        "At the core of iterative voting is the assumption that candidates mentioned by many sources are more likely to be true.",
        "However, additional aspects of a source influence its trustwor-thiness, besides external votes.",
        "Our goal is to accurately assess truthfulness of fact candidates by taking into account the language of sources that mention them.",
        "A Mechanical Turk study we carried out revealed that there is a significant correlation between objectivity of language and trustworthiness of sources.",
        "Objectivity of language refers to the use of neutral, impartial language, which is not personal, judg-mental, or emotional.",
        "Trustworthiness refers to 1009 a source of information being reliable and truthful.",
        "We use linguistics features to detect if a given source objectively states facts or is speculative and opinionated.",
        "Additionally, in order to ensure that fact candidates mentioned in similar sources have similar believability scores, our believability computation model incorporates influence of co-mentions.",
        "However, we must avoid falsely boosting co-mentioned fact candidates.",
        "Our model addresses potential false boosts in two ways: first, by ensuring that co-mention influence is only propagated to related fact candidates; second, by ensuring that the degree of co-mention influence is determined by the trustworthiness of the sources in which co-mentions occur.",
        "The contribution of this paper is a language-aware truth-finding approach.",
        "More precisely, we make the following contributions: (1) Alternative Fact Candidates: Truth-finders rank a given fact candidate with respect to its alternatives.",
        "For example, alternative places where Barack Obama could have been born.",
        "Virtually all existing truth-finders assume that the alternatives are provided.",
        "In contrast, we developed a method for generating alternative fact candidates.",
        "(2) Objectivity-Trustworthiness Correlation: We hypothesize that objectivity of language and trustworthiness of sources are positively correlated.",
        "To test this hypothesis, we designed a Mechanical Turk study.",
        "The study showed that this correlation does in fact hold.",
        "(3) Objectivity Classifier: Using labeled data from the Mechanical Turk study, we developed and trained an objectivity classifier which performed better than prior proposed lexicons from literature.",
        "(4) Believability Computa-tion: We developed FactChecker, a truth-finding method that linearly combines objectivity and co-mention influence.",
        "Our experiments showed that FactChecker outperforms prior methods.",
        "2 Fact Candidates In this section, we formally define what constitutes a fact candidate and describe how we go about understanding semantics of fact candidates.",
        "We then present our approach for generating alternative fact candidates.",
        "2.1 Representation The triple format is the most common representation of facts in knowledge bases.",
        "A formal specification of the triple format is presented in the RDF primer 1 .",
        "In RDF, data is represented as subject-predicate-object (SPO) triples.",
        "In this work, we restrict predicates to verbs (or verbal phrases such as ?plays for?, ?graduated from?, etc.).",
        "Literature on automatic relation discovery (Fader et al., 2011) has shown that verbal phrases uncover a large fraction of binary predicates while reducing the amount of noisy phrases that do not denote any relations.",
        "Therefore, we define a fact candidate as follows: Definition 1 (Fact Candidate) A fact candidate f i is an ?S?",
        "V ?O?",
        "triple; where S is the subject, V is a verbal phrase, and O is the object.",
        "We aim to compute the truthfulness of f i , ?",
        "(f i ) ?",
        "{T, F}, where T and F stand for true and false, respectively.",
        "Note that in this paper we are interested in cases where ?",
        "(f i ) is either T or F .",
        "That is, we assess truthfulness of factual statements and not opinions whose truthfulness is often both T and F to some degree.",
        "For example, the triples: ?Obama?",
        "born in ?Kenya?",
        "and ?Obama?",
        "graduated from ?Harvard?",
        "are valid fact candidates.",
        "However, the triple: ?Obama?",
        "deserves ?Nobel Peace Prize?",
        "is not.",
        "2.2 Semantics Based on the SVO triple, the meaning of a fact candidate can be unclear and ambiguous.",
        "There-fore, we first determine the semantics of a fact candidate before computing its truthfulness.",
        "Entity Types.",
        "We first determine the expected types of the subject and object in the SVO.",
        "For ex-ample, for the SVO ?Einstein?",
        "died in ?Princeton?, the expected types are person ?",
        "location.",
        "We determine this by first computing the types of entities that are valid for each verb (verbal phrase) in a large SVO collection of 114m SVO triples (Talukdar et al., 2012).",
        "Typing verbal phrases is a once-off computation.",
        "Our phrase typing method is similar to prior work on typing relational phrases (Nakashole et al., 2012).",
        "Examples of typed phrases are: ?person?",
        "died in ?year?, ?person?",
        "died in ?location?, and ?athlete?",
        "plays for ?team?.",
        "Given a triple, we look up the types for the subject and the object and then determine which of the typed phrases are compatible with the current triple.",
        "We look up entity types in a knowledge 1 http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/ 1010 base containing entities and their types.",
        "In partic-ular, we use the NELL entity typing API (Carlson et al., 2010).",
        "NELL's entity typing method has high recall because when entities are not in the knowledge base, it performs on-the-fly type inference using the Web.",
        "This is not the case for other options such as (Auer et al., 2007; Bollacker et al., 2008; Hoffart et al., 2011).",
        "Relation Cardinality.",
        "Next, we learn cardinalities of verbal phrases.",
        "Cardinality refers to how arguments of a given relation relate to one another numerically.",
        "We define the relation cardinality of a verb Card(V ), as the average number of expected arguments per given subject.",
        "For example, for the relation ?died in?, 1 location is expected for each subject.",
        "For other relations, the expected number of arguments can be greater than 1 but less than n : n ?",
        "R, n > 1.",
        "We approximate n using statistics from the 114m SVO corpus based on the average number of arguments per given first argument.",
        "In a once-off computation, we generate cardinality approximations per typed verbal phrase V and its inverse V ?1 .",
        "For example, we generate the cardinality estimates for both: ?person?",
        "died in ?location?",
        "and for ?location?",
        "INVERSE-OF(died in) ?person?.",
        "Synonymous Relations.",
        "Natural language is diverse.",
        "Semantically similar phrases can be syntactically different.",
        "Therefore, we learn other verbs that can be used to substitute V in SVO.",
        "We pre-compute synonymous phrases from the 114m SVO corpus using distributional semantics in the same spirit as (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Nakashole et al., 2012).",
        "Synonymous verbs, relation cardinalities, and entity types enable us to generate alternative fact candidates.",
        "2.3 Alternative Fact Candidates Truth-finding methods rank f i relative to alternative candidates.",
        "While prior methods assume the alternatives are known apriori, we developed a method for generating alternative fact candidates.",
        "For a given f i , we first identify the fixed argument.",
        "The fixed argument is the argument of the SVO which when fixed, requires finding the fewest number of alternative candidates.",
        "For ex-ample, for ?Einstein?",
        "died in ?Princeton?, the solution is to fix the subject.",
        "This is because the cardinality of ?person?",
        "died in ?location?",
        "is one (1).",
        "On the other hand, the cardinality of ?INVERSE- OF(died in)?",
        "is many(n).",
        "In other words, the number of places where a person can be born (one) is much fewer than the number of people that can die in a place (many).",
        "In our example, alternatives are possible places, other than Prince-ton, where Einstein could have died.",
        "For example: ?Einstein?",
        "died in ?Germany?",
        "or ?Einstein?",
        "died in ?Switzerland?.",
        "More generally, the fixed argument of fact candidate f i , is defined as follows: Definition 2 (Fixed Argument) Let Card(V) be the cardinality of V and Card(V ?1 ) be the cardinality of the inverse of V , if Card(V ) < Card(V ?1 ), then the fixed argument is the sub-ject, Arg fixed (f i ) = S, else it is the object, O.",
        "If Card(V ) == Card(V ?1 ), then both arguments are fixed, one at a time.",
        "We use the fixed argument to define a topic as the fixed argument plus the verb.",
        "Therefore, for the SVO ?X?",
        "died in ?Y?, the topic ?places where X died?, (Arg fixed = S), is not the same as the topic ?people who died in Y?",
        "(Arg fixed = O).",
        "To locate alternatives, we use the topic (Arg fixed + V ) as a query.",
        "We search three sources to either locate relevant documents or relevant triples: the Google Web search API, the 114m SVO collection, and the NELL KB.",
        "The SVO collection and the KB return triples, however, the Web search API returns documents.",
        "Therefore, we apply a triple extractor to the retrieved documents.",
        "For all potential alternative triples, we perform type checking to ensure that the arguments of the triples are type-compatible with f i .",
        "Further-more, we generate an additional query for every synonymous verb sV i , replacing V with sV i .",
        "Example queries are: ?Einstein died in?, ?Einstein passed in?, etc.",
        "3 Objectivity and Trustworthiness The principle of objective journalism, which is a significant part of journalistic ethics, aims to promote factual and fair reporting, undistorted by emotion or personal bias (Schudson, 1978; Ka-plan, 2002).",
        "Objectivity is also required in reference sources such as encyclopedias, scientific pub-lications, and textbooks.",
        "For example, Wikipedia enforces a neutral point-of-view policy (NPOV) 2 .",
        "Articles violating the NPOV policy are marked 2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral point of view 1011 to indicate potential bias.",
        "While opinions, emo-tions, and speculations can also be expressed using objective language, they are often stated using subjective language (Turney et al., 2002; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Wiebe et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2005; Recasens et al., 2013).",
        "For example, consider the following pieces of text: (S) Well, I think Obama was born in Kenya because his grandma who lives in Kenya said he was born there.",
        "(O) Theories allege that Obama's published birth certificate is a forgery, that his actual birthplace is not Hawaii but Kenya.",
        "Text S is a snippet from Yahoo Answers and text O is a snippet from the Wikipedia page ti-tled: ?Barack Obama Citizenship Conspiracy The-ories?.",
        "S is subjective, expressing the opinion of the author.",
        "On the other hand, O is objective, stating only what has been alleged.",
        "Literature on sentiment analysis (Turney et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2005), subjectivity detection (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Wiebe et al., 2004), and bias detection (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Recasens et al., 2013) has developed lexicons for identifying subjective language.",
        "Due to the principle of objective journalism and the requirement of objectivity placed on reference sources, we hypothesize a link between objectivity and trustworthiness as follows.",
        "Hypothesis 1 Objective sources are more trustworthy than subjective sources.",
        "Therefore, we can assume that fact candidates stated in objective sources are more likely to be true than those stated in subjective sources.",
        "To test the validity of the hypothesis, we carried out a study where we solicited human input.",
        "3.1 Mechanical Turk Study We deployed an annotation study on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) 3 , a crowd-sourcing platform for tasks requiring human input.",
        "Tasks on MTurk are small questionnaires consisting of a description and a set of questions.",
        "Our study consisted of two independent tasks.",
        "The first task was titled ?Trustworthiness of News Articles?, where annotators were given a link to a news article and 3 http://www.mturk.com Figure 1: Summary of the results of the annotation study on objectivity and trustworthiness.",
        "asked to judge if they thought it was trustworthy or not.",
        "The second task was titled ?Objectivity of News Articles?.",
        "For this task, annotators were asked to judge if a given article is objective or subjective.",
        "For both tasks a third option of ?not sure?",
        "was provided.",
        "We randomly selected 500 news articles from a corpus of about 300,000 news articles obtained from Google News from the topics of Top News, Business, Entertainment, and SciTech.",
        "For each task, every article was judged by three annotators.",
        "This produced a total of 3000 annotations.",
        "When we analyzed the output, we accepted a label as valid for a given article if the label was selected by the majority of the judges.",
        "Based on this criteria, we obtained a set of 420 articles that were both labeled for trustworthiness and objectivity.",
        "A summary of the outcome of the study is shown in Figure 1; 74% of the untrustworthy articles were independently labeled as subjective.",
        "On the other hand, 64% of trustworthy articles were independently labeled as objective.",
        "These results indicate a non-trivial positive correlation between objectivity and trustworthiness.",
        "We leverage this correlation in our believability computation model.",
        "To incorporate objectivity in FactChecker, we require for a given source docu-ment, an objectivity score ?",
        "[0, 1], where 0 means the source is subjective and 1 means it is objective.",
        "Next, describe our method for automatically determining objectivity of sources.",
        "3.2 Automatic Objectivity Detection We trained a logistic regression classifier to predict the objectivity of a document.",
        "For training and testing data, we used the labeled data from the Mechanical Turk study.",
        "We additionally used labeled text from prior work on subjectivity detection (Pang and Lee, 2004).",
        "This resulted in a total of 4, 600 documents, half subjective and the other half objective.",
        "We used 4000 documents for 1012 # Feature 1 Subjectivity lexicon of strong and weak subjective words (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003).",
        "2 Sentiment lexicon of positive and negative words (Liu et al., 2005).",

        "training, 2000 per label.",
        "The rest of the documents were split into a development set (380) and a test set (220).",
        "A summary of the features we used is shown in Table 1.",
        "Features 1-3 refer to lexicons developed by prior methods on subjectivity (Wiebe et al., 2004), sentiment analysis (Liu et al., 2005) and bias detection (Recasens et al., 2013).",
        "Feature 4 refers to part-of-speech tags of the terms found in the document that are also in the lexicons.",
        "Feature 5 refers to bi-grams that frequently occur (men- tion frequency of > 10) in the 4, 600 documents.",
        "The most contributing features were the lexicons, features (1-3) and the frequent bi-grams, feature 5.",
        "We discovered that using frequent bi-gram features instead of uni-grams or bi-grams resulted in higher precision.",
        "The classifier was able to determine that for example bi-grams such as ?think that?, ?so funny?",
        "and ?you thought?",
        "are negative features for objectivity.",
        "Evaluation results of our objectivity detector vs. baselines are shown in Table 2.",
        "FactChecker's objectivity detector has precision of 0.7814 ?",
        "0.0539, with a 0.9-confidence Wilson score interval (Brown et al., 2001) and this outperforms the baselines.",
        "Next, we describe how we leverage objectivity into FactChecker's truthfulness model.",
        "4 Believability Computation Model FactChecker computes the believability score of a fact candidate from its: i) objectivity score and (ii) co-mention score.",
        "In this section we define each of these scores.",
        "The objectivity score reflects the trustworthiness of sources where a fact candidate is mentioned.",

        "?",
        "d k ?D i O(d k ) |D i | (1) We do not use the sum of objectivity of sources as the objectivity score because this enables fact candidates mentioned in many low objectivity sources to have high aggregate objectivity.",
        "Sim-ilarly, we avoid using average objectivity of the sources as it overestimates objectivity of candidates stated in few sources.",
        "A candidate mentioned in 10 sources with 0.9 objectivity should have higher objectivity than a candidate stated in 1 source of 0.9 objectivity.",
        "In Equation 1, log|D i | addresses this issue.",

        "Suppose candidate f i is mentioned in many highly objective sources, another candidate f j is stated in only one highly objective source d k where f i is also mentioned.",
        "Then the believability of f j should be boosted by it being co-mentioned with f i .",
        "If on the other hand f i and f j were co-mentioned in a subjective source, f j should receive less boost from f i .",

        "To remedy this, we only allow w ij to be greater than zero if the fact candidates f i and f j are on the same topic.",
        "Recall that the topic is determined by the fixed argument (Definition 2) and the verb.",
        "Allowing only fact candidates on the same topic to influence each other is important considering that many trivial facts are often repeated in sources of diverse quality.",
