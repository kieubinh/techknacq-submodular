        "Infants begin learning the phonetic categories of their native language in their first year (Kuhl et al., 1992; Polka and Werker, 1994; Werker and Tees, 1984).",
        "In theory, semantic information could offer a valuable cue for phoneme induction 1 by helping infants distinguish between minimal pairs, as linguists do (Trubetzkoy, 1939).",
        "However, due to a widespread assumption that infants do not know the meanings of many words at the age when they are learning phonetic categories (see Swingley, 2009 for a review), most recent models of early phonetic category acquisition have explored the phonetic learning problem in the absence of semantic information (de Boer and Kuhl, 2003; Dillon et al., 2013; 1 The models in this paper do not distinguish between phonetic and phonemic categories, since they do not capture phonological processes (and there are also none present in our synthetic data).",
        "We thus use the terms interchangeably.",
        "Feldman et al., 2013a; McMurray et al., 2009; Vallabha et al., 2007).",
        "Models without any semantic information are likely to underestimate infants?",
        "ability to learn phonetic categories.",
        "Infants learn language in the wild, and quickly attune to the fact that words have (pos- sibly unknown) meanings.",
        "The extent of infants?",
        "semantic knowledge is not yet known, but existing evidence shows that six-month-olds can associate some words with their referents (Bergelson and Swingley, 2012; Tincoff and Jusczyk, 1999, 2012), leverage non-acoustic contexts such as objects or articulations to distinguish similar sounds (Teinonen et al., 2008; Yeung and Werker, 2009), and map meaning (in the form of objects or images) to new word-forms in some laboratory settings (Friedrich and Friederici, 2011; Gogate and Bahrick, 2001; Shukla et al., 2011).",
        "These findings indicate that young infants are sensitive to co-occurrences between linguistic stimuli and at least some aspects of the world.",
        "In this paper we explore the potential contribution of semantic information to phonetic learning by formalizing a model in which learners attend to the word-level context in which phones appear (as in the lexical-phonetic learning model of Feldman et al., 2013a) and also to the situations in which word-forms are used.",
        "The modeled situations consist of combinations of categories of salient activities or objects, similar to the activity contexts explored by Roy et al. (2012), e.g.,?getting dressed?",
        "or ?eating breakfast?.",
        "We assume that child learners are able to infer a representation of the situational context from their non-linguistic environment.",
        "However, in our simulations we approximate the environmental information by running a topic model (Blei et al., 2003) over a corpus of child-directed speech to infer a topic distribution for each situation.",
        "These topic distributions are then used as input to our model to represent situational contexts.",
        "The situational information in our model is simi-1073 lar to that assumed by theories of cross-situational word learning (Frank et al., 2009; Smith and Yu, 2008; Yu and Smith, 2007), but our model does not require learners to map individual words to their referents.",
        "Even in the absence of word-meaning map-pings, situational information is potentially useful because similar-sounding words uttered in similar situations are more likely to be tokens of the same lexeme (containing the same phones) than similar-sounding words uttered in different situations.",
        "In simulations of vowel learning, inspired by Vallabha et al. (2007) and Feldman et al. (2013a), we show a clear improvement over previous models in both phonetic and lexical (word-form) categorization when situational context is used as an additional source of information.",
        "This improvement is especially noticeable when the word-level context is providing less information, arguably the more realistic setting.",
        "These results demonstrate that relying on situational co-occurrence can improve phonetic learning, even if learners do not yet know the meanings of individual words.",
        "2 Background and overview of models Infants attend to distributional characteristics of their input (Maye et al., 2002, 2008), leading to the hypothesis that phonetic categories could be acquired on the basis of bottom-up distributional learning alone (de Boer and Kuhl, 2003; Vallabha et al., 2007; McMurray et al., 2009).",
        "However, this would require sound categories to be well sepa-rated, which often is not the case -- for example, see Figure 1, which shows the English vowel space that is the focus of this paper.",
        "Recent work has investigated whether infants could overcome such distributional ambiguity by incorporating top-down information, in particular, the fact that phones appear within words.",
        "At six months, infants begin to recognize word-forms such as their name and other frequently occurring words (Mandel et al., 1995; Jusczyk and Hohne, 1997), without necessarily linking a meaning to these forms.",
        "This ?protolexicon?",
        "can help differentiate phonetic categories by adding word contexts in which certain sound categories appear (Swingley, 2009; Feldman et al., 2013b).",
        "To explore this idea further, Feldman et al. (2013a) implemented the Lexical-Distributional (LD) model, which jointly learns a set of phonetic vowel categories and a set of word-forms containing those categories.",
        "Simulations showed that the use of lexical context greatly 500100015002000250030003500 F2 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 F1 oa uw aw oo uh ah er ehae ihei iy Figure 1: The English vowel space (generated from Hillenbrand et al. (1995), see Section 6.2), plotted using the first two formants.",
        "improved phonetic learning.",
        "Our own Topic-Lexical-Distributional (TLD) model extends the LD model to include an additional type of context: the situations in which words appear.",
        "To motivate this extension and clarify the differences between the models, we now provide a high-level overview of both models; details are given in Sections 3 and 4.",
        "2.1 Overview of LD model Both the LD and TLD models are computational-level models of phonetic (specifically, vowel) categorization where phones (vowels) are presented to the model in the context of words.",
        "2 The task is to infer a set of phonetic categories and a set of lexical items on the basis of the data observed for each word token x i .",
        "In the original LD model, the observations for token x i are its frame f i , which consists of a list of consonants and slots for vowels, and the list of vowel tokensw i .",
        "(The TLD model includes additional observations, described below.)",
        "A single vowel token, w ij , is a two dimensional vector representing the first two formants (peaks in the frequency spectrum, ordered from lowest to highest).",
        "For example, a token of the word kitty would have the frame f i = k t , containing two consonant phones, /k/ and /t/, with two vowel phone slots in between, and two vowel formant vectors, 2 For a related model that also tackles the word segmentation problem, see Elsner et al. (2013).",
        "In a model of phonological learning, Fourtassi and Dupoux (submitted) show that semantic context information similar to that used here remains useful despite segmentation errors.",
        "1074 wi0 = [464, 2294] and w i1 = [412, 2760].",
        "3 Given the data, the model must assign each vowel token to a vowel category, w ij = c. Both the LD and the TLD models do this using intermediate lexemes, `, which contain vowel category assignments, v `j = c, as well as a frame f ` .",
        "If a word token is assigned to a lexeme, x i = `, the vowels within the word are assigned to that lex-eme's vowel categories, w ij = v `j = c. 4 The word and lexeme frames must match, f i = f ` .",
        "Lexical information helps with phonetic categorization because it can disambiguate highly overlapping categories, such as the ae and eh categories in Figure 1.",
        "A purely distributional learner who observes a cluster of data points in the ae-eh region is likely to assume all these points belong to a single category because the distributions of the categories are so similar.",
        "However, a learner who attends to lexical context will notice a difference: contexts that only occur with ae will be observed in one part of the ae-eh region, while contexts that only occur with eh will be observed in a different (though partially overlapping) space.",
        "The learner then has evidence of two different categories occurring in different sets of lexemes.",
        "Simulations with the LD model show that using lexical information to constrain phonetic learning can greatly improve categorization accuracy (Feld- man et al., 2013a), but it can also introduce errors.",
        "When two word tokens contain the same consonant frame but different vowels (i.e., minimal pairs), the model is more likely to categorize those two vowels together.",
        "Thus, the model has trouble distinguishing minimal pairs.",
        "Although young children also have trouble with minimal pairs (Stager and Werker, 1997; Thiessen, 2007), the LD model may overestimate the degree of the problem.",
        "We hypothesize that if a learner is able to associate words with the contexts of their use (as children likely are), this could provide a weak source of information for disambiguating minimal pairs even without knowing their exact meanings.",
        "That is, if the learner hears kV 1 t and kV 2 t in different situational contexts, they are likely to be different lexical items (and V 1 and V 2 different phones), despite the lexical similarity between them.",
        "3 In simulations we also experiment with frames in which consonants are not represented perfectly.",
        "4 The notation is overloaded: w ij refers both to the vowel formants and the vowel category assignments, and x i refers to both the token identity and its assignment to a lexeme.",
        "2.2 Overview of TLD model To demonstrate the benefit of situational informa-tion, we develop the Topic-Lexical-Distributional (TLD) model, which extends the LD model by assuming that words appear in situations analogous to documents in a topic model.",
        "Each situation h is associated with a mixture of topics ?",
        "h , which is assumed to be observed.",
        "Thus, for the ith token in situation h, denoted x hi , the observed data will be its frame f hi , vowels w hi , and topic vector ?",
        "h .",
        "From an acquisition perspective, the observed topic distribution represents the child's knowledge of the context of the interaction: she can distinguish bathtime from dinnertime, and is able to recognize that some topics appear in certain contexts (e.g. animals on walks, vegetables at dinnertime) and not in others (few vegetables appear at bath-time).",
        "We assume that the child would learn these topics from observing the world around her and the co-occurrences of entities and activities in the world.",
        "Within any given situation, there might be a mixture of different (actual or possible) topics that are salient to the child.",
        "We assume further that as the child learns the language, she will begin to associate specific words with each topic as well.",
        "Thus, in the TLD model, the words used in a situation are topic-dependent, implying meaning, but without pinpointing specific referents.",
        "Although the model observes the distribution of topics in each situation (corresponding to the child observing her non-linguistic environment), it must learn to associate each (phonetically and lexically ambiguous) word token with a particular topic from that distribution.",
        "The occurrence of similar-sounding words in different situations with mostly non-overlapping topics will provide evidence that those words belong to different topics and that they are therefore different lexemes.",
        "Conversely, potential minimal pairs that occur in situations with similar topic distributions are more likely to belong to the same topic and thus the same lexeme.",
        "Although we assume that children infer topic distributions from the non-linguistic environment, we will use transcripts from CHILDES to create the word/phone learning input for our model.",
        "These transcripts are not annotated with environmental context, but Roy et al. (2012) found that topics learned from similar transcript data using a topic model were strongly correlated with immediate activities and contexts.",
        "We therefore obtain the topic distributions used as input to the TLD model by 1075 training an LDA topic model (Blei et al., 2003) on a superset of the child-directed transcript data we use for lexical-phonetic learning, dividing the transcripts into small sections (the ?documents?",
        "in LDA) that serve as our distinct situations h. As noted above, the learned document-topic distributions ?",
        "are treated as observed variables in the TLD model to represent the situational context.",
        "The topic-word distributions learned by LDA are dis-carded, since these are based on the (correct and unambiguous) words in the transcript, whereas the TLD model is presented with phonetically ambiguous versions of these word tokens and must learn to disambiguate them and associate them with topics.",
        "3 Lexical-Distributional Model In this section we describe more formally the generative process for the LD model (Feldman et al., 2013a), a joint Bayesian model over phonetic categories and a lexicon, before describing the TLD extension in the following section.",
        "The set of phonetic categories and the lexicon are both modeled using non-parametric Dirichlet Process priors, which return a potentially infinite number of categories or lexemes.",
        "A DP is parametrized as DP (?,H), where ?",
        "is a real-valued hyperparameter andH is a base distribution.H may be con-tinuous, as when it generates phonetic categories in formant space, or discrete, as when it generates lexemes as a list of phonetic categories.",

        "DP (?,H), returns a distribution over a set of draws from H , i.e., a discrete distribution over a set of categories or lexemes generated by H .",
        "In the mixture model setting, the category assignments are then generated from G, with the datapoints themselves generated by the corresponding components fromH .",
        "IfH is infinite, the support of the DP is likewise infinite.",
        "During inference, we marginalize over G. 3.1 Phonetic Categories: IGMM Following previous models of vowel learning (de Boer and Kuhl, 2003; Vallabha et al., 2007; McMurray et al., 2009; Dillon et al., 2013) we assume that vowel tokens are drawn from a Gaussian mixture model.",
        "The Infinite Gaussian Mixture Model (IGMM) (Rasmussen, 2000) includes a DP prior, as described above, in which the base distribution H C generates multivariate Gaussians drawn from a Normal Inverse-Wishart prior.",

        "3.2 Lexicon In the LD model, vowel phones appear within words drawn from the lexicon.",
        "Each such lexeme is represented as a frame plus a list of vowel categories v ` .",

        "In this paper, we investigated whether contextual semantic information could be of help when learning phonetic categories.",
        "We found that this contextual information can improve phonetic learning performance considerably, especially in situations where there is a high degree of phonetic ambiguity in the word-forms that learners hear.",
        "This suggests that previous models that have ignored semantic information may have underestimated the information that is available to infants.",

        "The contextual semantic information that the TLD model tracks is similar to that potentially used in other linguistic learning tasks.",
        "Theories of cross-situational word learning (Smith and Yu, 2008; Yu and Smith, 2007) assume that sensitivity to situational co-occurrences between words and non-linguistic contexts is a precursor to learning the meanings of individual words.",
        "Under this view, contextual semantics is available to infants well before they have acquired large numbers of semantic minimal pairs.",
        "However, recent experimental evidence indicates that learners do not always retain detailed information about the referents that are present in a scene when they hear a word (Medina et al., 2011; Trueswell et al., 2013).",
        "This evidence poses a direct challenge to theories of cross-situational word learning.",
        "Our account does not necessarily require learners to track co-occurrences between words and individual objects, but instead focuses on more abstract information about salient events and topics in the environment; it will be important to investigate to what extent infants encode this information and use it in phonetic learning.",
        "Regardless of the specific way in which infants encode semantic information, our method of adding this information by using LDA topics from transcript data was shown to be effective.",
        "This method is practical because it can approximate semantic information without relying on extensive manual annotation.",
        "The LD model extended the phonetic categorization task by adding word contexts; the TLD model presented here goes even further, adding larger situational contexts.",
