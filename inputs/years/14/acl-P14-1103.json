        "Many aspects of human cognition involve the interaction of constraints that push a decision-maker toward different options, whether in something so trivial as choosing a movie or so important as a fight-or-flight response.",
        "These constraint-driven decisions can be modeled with a log-linear system.",
        "In these models, a set of constraints is weighted and their violations are used to determine a probability distribution over outcomes.",
        "But where do these constraints come from?",
        "We consider this question by examining the dominant framework in modern phonology, Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky, 1993, OT), implemented in a log-linear framework, MaxEnt OT (Goldwater and Johnson, 2003), with output forms?",
        "probabilities based on a weighted sum of constraint violations.",
        "OT analyses generally assume that the constraints are innate and univer-sal, both to obviate the problem of learning con-straints?",
        "identities and to limit the set of possible languages.",
        "We propose a new approach: to learn constraints with limited innate phonological knowledge by identifying sets of constraint violations that explain the observed distributional data, instead of selecting constraints from an innate set of constraint definitions.",
        "Because the constraints are identified as sets of violations, this also permits constraints specific to a given language to be learned.",
        "This method, which we call IBPOT, uses an Indian Buffet Process (IBP) prior to define the space of possible constraint violation matri-ces, and uses Bayesian reasoning to identify constraint matrices likely to have generated the observed data.",
        "In identifying constraints solely by their extensional violation profiles, this method does not directly identify the intensional definitions of the identified constraints, but to the extent that the resulting violation profiles are phonologically interpretable, we may conclude that the data themselves guide constraint identification.",
        "We test IBPOT on tongue-root vowel harmony in Wolof, a West African language.",
        "The set of constraints learned by the model satisfy two major goals: they explain the data as well as the standard phonological analysis, and their violation structures correspond to the standard constraints.",
        "This suggests an alternative data-driven genesis for constraints, rather than the traditional assumption of fully innate constraints.",
        "2 Phonology and Optimality Theory 2.1 OT structure Optimality Theory has been used for constraint-based analysis of many areas of language, but we focus on its most successful application: phonology.",
        "We consider an OT analysis of the mappings 1094 between underlying forms and their phonological manifestations ?",
        "i.e., mappings between forms in the mental lexicon and the actual vocalized forms of the words.",
        "1 Stated generally, an OT system takes some in-put, generates a set of candidate outputs, determines what constraints each output violates, and then selects a candidate output with a relatively unobjectionable violation profile.",
        "To do this, an OT system contains four major components: a generator GEN, which generates candidate output forms for the input; a set of constraints CON, which penalize candidates; a evaluation method EVAL, which selects an winning candidate; and H , a language-particular weighting of constraints that EVAL uses to determine the winning candidate.",
        "Previous OT work has focused on identifying the appropriate formulation of EVAL and the values and acquisition of H , while taking GEN and CON as given.",
        "Here, we expand the learning task by proposing an acquisition method for CON.",
        "To learn CON, we propose a data-driven markedness constraint learning system that avoids both innateness and tractability issues.",
        "Unlike previous OT learning methods, which assume known constraint definitions and only learn the relative strength of these constraints, the IBPOT learns constraint violation profiles and weights for them simultaneously.",
        "The constraints are derived from sets of violations that effectively explain the observed data, rather than being selected from a pre-existing set of possible constraints.",
        "2.2 OT as a weighted-constraint method Although all OT systems share the same core structure, different choices of EVAL lead to different behaviors.",
        "In IBPOT, we use the log-linear EVAL developed by Goldwater and Johnson (2003) in their MaxEnt OT system.",
        "MEOT extends traditional OT to account for variation (cases in which multiple candidates can be the winner), as well as gradient/probabilistic productions (Anttila, 1997) and other constraint interactions (e.g., cumulativity) that traditional OT cannot handle (Keller, 2000).",
        "MEOT also is motivated by the general MaxEnt framework, whereas most other OT formulations are ad hoc constructions specific to phonology.",
        "In MEOT, each constraint C i is associated with 1 Although phonology is usually framed in terms of sound, sign languages also have components that serve equivalent roles in the physical realization of signs (Stokoe, 1960).",
        "a weight w i < 0.",
        "(Weights are always negative in OT; a constraint violation can never make a candidate more likely to win.)",
        "For a given input-candidate pair (x, y), f i (y, x) is the number of violations of constraint C i by the pair.",
        "As a maximum entropy model, the probability of y given x is proportional to the exponential of the weighted sum of violations, ?",
        "i w i f i (y, x).",
        "If Y(x) is the set of all output candidates for the input x, then the probability of y as the winning output is: p(y|x) = exp ( ?",

        "i w i f i (z, x)) (1) This formulation represents a probabilistic extension of the traditional formulation of OT (Prince and Smolensky, 1993).",
        "Traditionally, constraints form a strict hierarchy, where a single violation of a high-ranked constraint is worse than any number of violations of lower-ranked constraints.",
        "Traditional OT is also deterministic, with the optimal candidate always selected.",
        "In MEOT, the constraint weights define hierarchies of varying strictness, and some probability is assigned to all candidates.",
        "If constraints?",
        "weights are close to-gether, multiple violations of lower-weighted constraints can reduce a candidate's probability below that of a competitor with a single high-weight violation.",
        "As the distance between weights in MEOT increases, the probability of a suboptimal candidate being chosen approaches zero; thus the traditional formulation is a limit case of MEOT.",

        "2.4 Learning Constraints Choosing a winning candidate presumes that a set of constraints CON is available, but where do these constraints come from?",
        "The standard assumption within OT is that CON is innate and universal.",
        "But in the absence of direct evidence of innate constraints, we should prefer a method that can derive the constraints from cognitively-general learning over one that assumes they are pre-specified.",
        "Learning appropriate model features has been an important idea in the development of constraint-based models (Della Pietra et al., 1997).",
        "The innateness assumption can induce tractability issues as well.",
        "The strictest formulation of innateness posits that virtually all constraints are shared across all languages, even when there is no evidence for the constraint in a particular language (Tesar and Smolensky, 2000).",
        "Strict universality is undermined by the extremely large set of constraints it must weight, as well as the possible existence of language-particular constraints (Smith, 2004).",
        "A looser version of universality supposes that constraints are built compositionally from a set of constraint templates or primitives or phonological features (Hayes, 1999; Smith, 2004; Id-sardi, 2006; Riggle, 2009).",
        "This version allows language-particular constraints, but it comes with a computational cost, as the learner must be able to generate and evaluate possible constraints while learning the language's phonology.",
        "Even with relatively simple constraint templates, such as the phonological constraint learner of Hayes and Wilson (2008), the number of possible constraints expands exponentially.",
        "Depending on the specific formulation of the constraints, the constraint identification problem may even be NP-hard (Idsardi, 2006; Heinz et al., 2009).",
        "Our approach of casting the learning problem as one of identifying violation profiles is an attempt to determine the amount that can be learned about the active constraints in a paradigm without hypothesizing intensional constraint definitions.",
        "The violation profile informa-1096 tion used by our model could then be used to narrow the search space for intensional constraints, either by performing post-hoc analysis of the constraints identified by our model or by combining intensional constraint search into the learning process.",
        "We discuss each of these possibilities in Section 5.2.",
        "Innateness is less of a concern for faithfulness than markedness constraints.",
        "Faithfulness violations are determined by the changes between an input form and a candidate, yielding an independent motivation for a universal set of faithfulness constraints (McCarthy, 2008).",
        "Some markedness constraints can also be motivated in a universal manner (Hayes, 1999), but many markedness constraints lack such grounding.",

        "This shows that the IBP's prior preferences can be overcome in order to have constraints that better explain the data.",
        "Constraint comparison Our second criterion is the acquisition of meaningful constraints, that is, ones whose violation profiles have phonologically-grounded explanations.",
        "IBPOT learns the same number of markedness constraints as the phonological standard (two); over the final 1000 iterations of the model runs, 99.2% of the iterations had two markedness constraints, and the rest had three.",
        "Turning to the form of these constraints, Figure 2 shows violation profiles from the last iteration of a representative IBPOT run.",
        "7 Because vowel heights must be faithful between input and out-put, the Wolof data is divided into nine separate paradigms, each containing the four candidates (ATR/RTR ?",
        "ATR/RTR) for the vowel heights in the input.",
        "The violations on a given output form only affect probabilities within its paradigm.",
        "As a result, learned constraints are consistent within paradigms, but across paradigms, the same constraint may serve different purposes.",
        "For instance, the strongest learned markedness constraint, shown as M1 in Figure 2, has the same violations as the top-ranked constraint that actively distinguishes between candidates in each paradigm.",
        "For the five paradigms with at least one high vowel (the top row and left column), M1 has the same violations as *I, as *I penalizes some but not all of the candidates.",
        "In the 7 Specifically, from the run with the median joint posterior.",
        "other four paradigms, *I penalizes none of the candidates, and the IBPOT learner has no reason to learn it.",
        "Instead, it learns that M1 has the same violations as HARMONY, which is the highest-weighted constraint that distinguishes between candidates in these paradigms.",
        "Thus in the high-vowel paradigms, M1 serves as *I, while in the low/mid-vowel paradigms, it serves as HARMONY.",
        "The lower-weighted M2 is defined noisily, as the higher-ranked M1 makes some values of M2 inconsequential.",
        "Consider the top-left paradigm of Figure 2, the high-high input, in which only one candidate does not violate M1 (*I).",
        "Because M1 has a much higher weight than M2, a violation of M2 has a negligible effect on a candidate's probability.",
        "8 In such cells, the constraint's value is influenced more by the prior than by the data.",
        "These inconsequential cells are overlaid with grey stripes in Figure 2.",
        "The meaning of M2, then, depends only on the consequential cells.",
        "In the high-vowel paradigms, M2 matches HARMONY, and the learned and standard constraints agree on all consequential viola-tions, despite being essentially at chance on the indistinguishable violations (58%).",
        "On the non-high paradigms, the meaning of M2 is unclear, as HARMONY is handled by M1 and *I is unviolated.",
        "In all four paradigms, the model learns that the RTR-RTR candidate violates M2 and the ATR-ATR candidate does not; this appears to be the model's attempt to reinforce a pattern in the lowest-ranked faithfulness constraint (PARSE[atr]), which the ATR-ATR candidate never violates.",
        "Thus, while the IBPOT constraints are not identical to the phonologically standard ones, they reflect a version of the standard constraints that is consistent with the IBPOT framework.",
        "9 In paradigms where each markedness constraint distinguishes candidates, the learned constraints match the standard constraints.",
        "In paradigms where only one constraint distinguishes candi-dates, the top learned constraint matches it and the second learned constraint exhibits a pattern consistent with a low-ranked faithfulness constraint.",
        "8 Given the learned weights in Fig. 2, if the losing candidate violates M1, its probability changes from 10 ?12 when the preferred candidate does not violate M2 to 10 ?8 when it does.",

        "Furthermore, these constraints are successfully acquired without any knowledge of the phonological structure of the data beyond the faithfulness violation profiles.",
        "The model's ability to infer constraint violation profiles without theoretical constraint structure provides an alternative solution to the problems of the traditionally innate and universal OT constraint set.",
        "As it jointly learns constraints and weights, the IBPOT model calls to mind Hayes and Wilson's (2008) joint phonotactic learner.",
        "Their learner also jointly learns weights and constraints, but directly selects its constraints from a compositional grammar of constraint definitions.",
        "This limits their learner in practice by the rapid explosion in the number of constraints as the maximum constraint definition size grows.",
        "By directly learning violation profiles, the IBPOT model avoids this ex-plosion, and the violation profiles can be automatically parsed to identify the constraint definitions that are consistent with the learned profile.",
        "The inference method of the two models is different as well; the phonotactic learner selects constraints greedily, whereas the sampling on M in IBPOT asymptotically approaches the posterior.",
        "The two learners also address related but different phonological problems.",
        "The phonotactic learner considers phonotactic problems, in which only output matters.",
        "The constraints learned by Hayes and Wilson's learner are essentially OT markedness constraints, but their learner does not have to account for varied inputs or effects of faithfulness constraints.",

        "Alternately, phonological knowledge could be integrated into a joint constraint learning process in the form of a naturalness bias on the constraint weights or a phonologically-motivated replacement for the IBP prior.",
        "The results presented here use binary con-straints, where each candidate violates each constraint only once, a result of the IBP's restriction to binary matrices.",
        "Non-binarity can be handled by using the binary matrix M to indicate whether a candidate violates a constraint, with a second 1101 distribution determining the number of violations.",
        "Alternately, a binary matrix can directly capture non-binary constraints; Frank and Satta (1998) converted existing non-binary constraints into a binary OT system by representing non-binary constraints as a set of equally-weighted overlapping constraints, each accounting for one violation.",
        "The non-binary harmony constraint, for instance, becomes a set {*(at least one disharmony), *(at least two disharmonies), etc.}.",
