        "Statistical machine translation (SMT) systems are trained using bilingual sentence-aligned parallel corpora.",
        "Theoretically, SMT can be applied to any language pair, but in practice it produces the state-of-art results only for language pairs with ample training data, like English-Arabic, English-Chinese, French-English, etc.",
        "SMT gets stuck in a severe bottleneck for many minority or ?low resource?",
        "languages with insufficient data.",
        "This drastically limits which languages SMT can be successfully applied to.",
        "Because of this, collecting parallel corpora for minor languages has become an interesting research challenge.",
        "There are various options for creating training data for new language pairs.",
        "Past approaches have examined harvesting translated documents from the web (Resnik and Smith, 2003; Uszkoreit et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2013), or discovering parallel fragments from comparable corpora (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005; Abdul-Rauf and Schwenk, 2009; Smith et al., 2010).",
        "Until relatively recently, little consideration has been given to creating parallel data from scratch.",
        "This is because the cost of hiring professional translators is prohibitively high.",
        "For instance, Germann (2001) hoped to hire professional translators to create a modest sized 100,000 word Tamil-English parallel corpus, but were stymied by the costs and the difficulty of finding good translators for a short-term commitment.",
        "Recently, crowdsourcing has opened the possibility of translating large amounts of text at low cost using non-professional translators.",
        "Facebook localized its web site into different languages using volunteers (TechCrunch, 2008).",
        "DuoLingo turns translation into an educational game, and translates web content using its language learners (von Ahn, 2013).",
        "Rather than relying on volunteers or gamifica-tion, NLP research into crowdsourcing translation has focused on hiring workers on the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform (Callison- Burch, 2009).",
        "This setup presents unique chal-lenges, since it typically involves non-professional translators whose language skills are varied, and since it sometimes involves participants who try to cheat to get the small financial reward (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2011).",
        "A natural approach for trying to shore up the skills of weak bilinguals is to pair them with a native speaker of the target language to edit their translations.",
        "We review relevant research from NLP and human-computer interaction (HCI) on collaborative translation processes in Section 2.",
        "To sort good translations from bad, researchers often solicit multiple, redundant translations and then build models to try to predict which translations are the best, or which translators tend to produce the highest quality translations.",

        "?",
        "A new graph-based algorithm for selecting the best translation among multiple translations of the same input.",
        "This method takes into account the collaborative relationship between the translators and the editors.",
        "2 Related work In the HCI community, several researchers have proposed protocols for collaborative translation efforts (Morita and Ishida, 2009b; Morita and Ishida, 2009a; Hu, 2009; Hu et al., 2010).",
        "These have focused on an iterative collaboration between monolingual speakers of the two languages, facilitated with a machine translation system.",
        "These studies are similar to ours in that they rely on native speakers?",
        "understanding of the target language to correct the disfluencies in poor translations.",
        "In our setup the poor translations are produced by bilingual individuals who are weak in the target language, and in their experiments the translations are the output of a machine translation system.",
        "1 Another significant difference is that the HCI studies assume cooperative participants.",
        "For in-stance, Hu et al. (2010) recruited volunteers from the International Children's Digital Library (Hour- cade et al., 2003) who were all well intentioned and participated out a sense of altruism and to build a good reputation among the other volunteer translators at childrenslibrary.org.",
        "Our setup uses anonymous crowd workers hired on Mechanical Turk, whose motivation to participate is financial.",
        "Bernstein et al. (2010) characterized the problems with hiring editors via MTurk for a word processing application.",
        "Workers were either lazy (meaning they made only minimal edits) or overly zealous (meaning they made many unnecessary edits).",
        "Bernstein et al. (2010) addressed this problem with a three step find-fix-verify process.",
        "In the first step, workers click on one word or phrase that needed to be corrected.",
        "In the next step, a separate group of workers proposed correc-1 A variety of HCI and NLP studies have confirmed the efficacy of monolingual or bilingual individuals post-editing of machine translation output (Callison-Burch, 2005; Koehn, 2010; Green et al., 2013).",
        "Past NLP work has also examined automatic post-editing(Knight and Chander, 1994).",
        "tions to problematic regions that had been identified by multiple workers in the first pass.",
        "In the final step, other workers would validate whether the proposed corrections were good.",
        "Most NLP research into crowdsourcing has focused on Mechanical Turk, following pioneering work by Snow et al. (2008) who showed that the platform was a viable way of collecting data for a wide variety of NLP tasks at low cost and in large volumes.",
        "They further showed that non-expert annotations are similar to expert annotations when many non-expert labelings for the same input are aggregated, through simple voting or through weighting votes based on how closely non-experts matched experts on a small amount of calibration data.",
        "MTurk has subsequently been widely adopted by the NLP community and used for an extensive range of speech and language applications (Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010).",
        "Although hiring professional translators to create bilingual training data for machine translation systems has been deemed infeasible, Mechanical Turk has provided a low cost way of creating large volumes of translations (Callison-Burch, 2009; Ambati and Vogel, 2010).",
        "For instance, Zbib et al. (2012; Zbib et al. (2013) translated 1.5 million words of Levine Arabic and Egyptian Arabic, and showed that a statistical translation system trained on the dialect data outperformed a system trained on 100 times more MSA data.",
        "Post et al. (2012) used MTurk to create parallel corpora for six Indian languages for less than $0.01 per word.",
        "MTurk workers translated more than half a million words worth of Malayalam in less than a week.",
        "Several researchers have examined the use of active learning to further reduce the cost of translation (Ambati et al., 2010; Ambati, 2012; Blood-good and Callison-Burch, 2010).",
        "Crowdsourcing allowed real studies to be conducted whereas most past active learning were simulated.",
        "Pavlick et al. (2014) conducted a large-scale demographic study of the languages spoken by workers on MTurk by translating 10,000 words in each of 100 languages.",
        "Chen and Dolan (2012) examined the steps necessary to build a persistent multilingual workforce on MTurk.",
        "This paper is most closely related to previous work by Zaidan and Callison-Burch (2011), who showed that non-professional translators could approach the level of professional translators.",
        "They solicited multiple redundant translations from dif-1135 Urdu translator: According to the territory's people the pamphlets from the Taaliban had been read in the announcements in all the mosques of the Northern Wazeerastan.",

        "They built a model to try to predict on a sentence-by-sentence and Turker-by-Turker which was the best translation or translator.",
        "They also hired US-based Turkers to edit the translations, since the translators were largely based in Pakistan and exhibited errors that are characteristic of speakers of English as a language.",
        "Zaidan and Callison-Burch (2011) observed only modest improvements when incorporating these edited translation into their model.",
        "We attempt to analyze why this is, and we proposed a new model to try to better leverage their data.",
        "3 Crowdsourcing Translation Setup We conduct our experiments using the data collected by Zaidan and Callison-Burch (2011).",
        "This data set consists 1,792 Urdu sentences from a variety of news and online sources, each paired with English translations provided by non-professional translators on Mechanical Turk.",
        "Each Urdu sentence was translated redundantly by 3 distinct translators, and each translation was edited by 3 separate (native English-speaking) editors to correct for grammatical and stylistic errors.",
        "In total, this gives us 12 non-professional English candidate sentences (3 unedited, 9 edited) per original Urdu sentence.",
        "52 different Turkers took part in the translation task, each translating 138 sentences on average.",
        "In the editing task, 320 Turkers participated, averaging 56 sentences each.",
        "For comparison, the data also includes 4 different reference translations for each source sentence, produced by professional translators.",
        "Table 1 gives an example of an unedited trans-lation, an edited translation, and a professional translation for the same sentence.",
        "The translations provided by translators on MTurk are generally done conscientiously, preserving the meaning of the source sentence, but typically contain simple mistakes like misspellings, typos, and awkward word choice.",
        "English-speaking editors, despite having no knowledge of the source lan-guage, are able to fix these errors.",
        "In this work, we show that the collaboration design of two heads?",
        "non-professional Urdu translators and non-professional English editors?",
        "yields better translated output than would either one working in iso-lation, and can better approximate the quality of professional translators.",
        "Analysis We know from inspection that translations seem to improve with editing (Table 1).",
        "Given the data from MTurk, we explore whether this is the case in general: Do all translations improve with editing?",
        "To what extent does the individual translator and the individual editor effect the quality of the final sentence?",
        "Figure 1: Relationship between editor aggressiveness and effectiveness.",
        "Each point represents an editor/translation pair.",
        "Aggressiveness (x-axis) is measured as the TER between the pre-edit and post-edit version of the translation, and effectiveness (y-axis) is measured as the average amount by which the editing reduces the translation's TER gold .",
        "While many editors make only a few changes, those who make many changes can bring the translation substantially closer to professional quality.",
        "We use translation edit rate (TER) as a measure of translation similarity.",
        "TER represents the amount of change necessary to transform one sentence into another, so a low TER means the two 1136 0.020.05 0.07 ?",

        "Bars reflect bins of translations, with the highest TER gold translations on the left, and the lowest on the right.",
        "We can see from the consistently negative ?",
        "TER gold in the bottom row that good editors are able to improve both good and bad translations.",
        "sentences are very similar.",
        "To capture the quality (?professionalness?)",
        "of a translation, we take the average TER of the translation against each of our gold translations.",
        "That is, we define TER gold of translation t as TER gold = 1 4 4 ?",
        "i=1 TER(gold i , t) (1) where a lower TER gold is indicative of a higher quality (more professional-sounding) translation.",
        "We first look at editors along two dimensions: their aggressiveness and their effectiveness.",
        "Some editors may be very aggressive (they make many changes to the original translation) but still be ineffective (they fail to bring the quality of the translation closer to that of a professional).",
        "We measure aggressiveness by looking at the TER between the pre- and post-edited versions of each editor's translations; higher TER implies more aggressive editing.",
        "To measure effectiveness, we look at the change in TER gold that results from the editing; negative ?TER gold means the editor effectively improved the quality of the translation, while positive ?TER gold means the editing actually brought the translation further from our gold standard.",
        "Figure 1 shows the relationship between these two qualities for individual editor/translation pairs.",
        "We see that while most translations require only a few edits, there are a large number of translations which improve substantially after heavy editing.",
        "This trend conforms to our intuition that editing is most useful when the translation has much room for improvement, and opens the question of whether good editors can offer improvements to translations of all qualities.",
        "To address this question, we split our translations into 5 bins, based on their TER gold .",
        "We also split our editors into 5 bins, based on their effectiveness (i.e. the average amount by which their editing reduces TER gold ).",
        "Figure 2 shows the degree to which editors at each level are able to improve the translations from each bin.",
        "We see that good editors are able to make improvements to translations of all qualities, but that good editing has the greatest impact on lower quality translations.",
        "This result suggests that finding good ed-itor/translator pairs, rather than good editors and good translators in isolation, should produce the best translations overall.",
        "Figure 3 gives an example of how an initially medium-quality translation, when combined with good editing, produces a better result than the higher-quality translation paired with mediocre editing.",
        "4 Problem Formulation The problem definition of the crowdsourcing translation task is straightforward: given a set of candidate translations for a source sentence, we want to choose the best output translation.",
        "This output translation is the result of the combined translation and editing stages.",
        "Therefore, our method operates over a heterogeneous network that includes translators and post-editors as well as the translated sentences that they produce.",
        "We frame the problem as follows.",
        "We form two graphs: the first graph (G T ) represents Turkers (translator/editor pairs) as nodes; the second graph (G C ) represents candidate translated and 1137 Figure 3: Three alternative translations (left) and the edited versions of each (right).",
        "Each edit on the right was produced by a different editor.",
        "Order reflects the TER gold of each translation, with the lowest TER gold on the top.",
        "Some translators receive low TER gold scores due to superficial errors, which can be easily improved through editing.",
        "In the above example, the middle-ranked translation (green) becomes the best translation after being revised by a good editor.",
        "post-edited sentences (henceforth ?candidates?)",
        "as nodes.",
        "These two graphs, G T and G C are combined as subgraphs of a third graph (G TC ).",
        "Edges in G TC connect author pairs (nodes in G T ) to the candidate that they produced (nodes in G C ).",
        "To-gether, G T , G C , and G TC define a co-ranking problem (Yan et al., 2012a; Yan et al., 2011b; Yan et al., 2012b) with linkage establishment (Yan et al., 2011a; Yan et al., 2012c), which we define formally as follows.",
        "Let G denote the heterogeneous graph with nodes V and edges E. Let G = (V ,E) = (V T , V C , E T , E C , E TC ).",
        "G is divided into three subgraphs, G T , G C , and G TC .",
        "G C = (V C , E C ) is a weighted undirected graph representing the candidates and their lexical relationships to one another.",
        "Let V C denote a collection of translated and edited candidates, and E C the lexical similarity between the candidates (see Section 4.3 for details).",
        "G T = (V T , E T ) is a weighted undirected graph representing collaborations between Turk-ers.",
        "V T is the set of translator/editor pairs.",
        "Edges E T connect translator/editor pairs in V T which share a translator and/or editor.",
        "Each collaboration (i.e. each node in V T ) produces a candidate (i.e. a node in V C ).",
        "G TC = (V TC , E TC ) is an unweighted bipartite graph that ties G T and G C together and represents ?authorship?.",
        "The graph G consists of nodes V TC = V T ?",

        "The three sub-networks (G T , G C , and G TC ) are illustrated in Figure 4.",
        "4.1 Inter-Graph Ranking The framework includes three random walks, one on G T , one on G C and one on G TC .",
        "A random walk on a graph is a Markov chain, its states being the vertices of the graph.",
        "It can be described by a stochastic square matrix, where the dimension is the number of vertices in the graph, and the entries describe the transition probabilities from one vertex to the next.",
        "The mutual reinforcement framework couples the two random walks on G T and G C that rank candidates and Turkers in isolation.",
        "The ranking method allows us to obtain a global ranking by taking into account the intra-/inter-component dependencies.",
        "In the following sections, we describe how we obtain the rankings on G T and G C , and then move on to discuss how the two are coupled.",
        "Our algorithm aims to capture the following intuitions.",
        "A candidate is important if 1) it is similar to many of the other proposed candidates and 2) it is authored by better qualified translators and/or post-editors.",
        "Analogously, a translator/editor pair is believed to be better qualified if 1) the editor is collaborating with a good translator and vice versa and 2) the pair has authored important candidates.",
        "This ranking schema is actually a reinforced process across the heterogeneous graphs.",
        "We use two vectors c = [pi(c)] |c|?1 and t = [pi(t)] |t|?1 to denote the saliency scores pi(.)",

        "We investigate three settings in which 1) edges connect two nodes when they share only a transla-tor, 2) edges connect two nodes when they share only a post-editor, and 3) edges connect two nodes when they share either a translator or a post-editor.",
        "These results are summarized in Table 3.",
        "Interestingly, we observe that when modeling the linkage between the collaboration pairs, connecting Turker pairs which share either a translator or the post-editor achieves better performance than connecting pairs that share only translators or connecting pairs which share only editors.",
        "This result supports the intuition that a denser collaboration matrix will help propagate saliency to good translators/post-editors and hence provides better predictions for candidate quality.",
