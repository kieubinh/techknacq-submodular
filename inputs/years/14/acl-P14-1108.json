        "motivation Language Models are a probabilistic approach for predicting the occurrence of a sequence of words.",
        "They are used in many applications, e.g. word prediction (Bickel et al., 2005), speech recognition (Rabiner and Juang, 1993), machine translation (Brown et al., 1990), or spelling correction (Mays et al., 1991).",

        ", w l .",
        "The probability P (w l 1 ) of this sequence can be broken down into a product of conditional prob-abilities: P (w l 1 ) =P (w 1 ) ?",

        "i=1 P (w i |w 1 ?",
        "?",
        "?w i?1 ) (1) Because of combinatorial explosion and data sparsity, it is very difficult to reliably estimate the probabilities that are conditioned on a longer subsequence.",
        "Therefore, by making a Markov assumption the true probability of a word sequence is only approximated by restricting conditional probabilities to depend only on a local context w i?1 i?n+1 of n ?",
        "1 preceding words rather than the full sequencew i?1 1 .",
        "The challenge in the construction of language models is to provide reliable estimators for the conditional probabilities.",
        "While the estimators can be learnt?using, e.g., a maximum likelihood estimator over n-grams obtained from training data?the obtained values are not very reliable for events which may have been observed only a few times or not at all in the training data.",
        "Smoothing is a standard technique to overcome this data sparsity problem.",
        "Various smoothing approaches have been developed and applied in the context of language models.",
        "Chen and Goodman (Chen and Goodman, 1999) introduced modified Kneser-Ney Smoothing, which up to now has been considered the state-of-the-art method for language modelling over the last 15 years.",
        "Modified Kneser-Ney Smoothing is an interpolating method which combines the estimated conditional probabilities P (w i |w i?1 i?n+1 ) recursively with lower order models involving a shorter local contextw i?1 i?n+2 and their estimate for P (w i |w i?1 i?n+2 ).",
        "The motivation for using lower order models is that shorter contexts may be observed more often and, thus, suffer less from data sparsity.",
        "However, a single rare word towards the end of the local context will always cause the context to be observed rarely in the training data and hence will lead to an unreliable estimation.",
        "1145 Because of Zipfian word distributions, most words occur very rarely and hence their true probability of occurrence may be estimated only very poorly.",
        "One word that appears at the end of a local context w i?1 i?n+1 and for which only a poor approximation exists may adversely affect the conditional probabilities in language models of all lengths ?",
        "leading to severe errors even for smoothed language models.",
        "Thus, the idea motivating our approach is to involve several lower order models which systematically leave out one position in the context (one may think of replacing the affected word in the context with a wildcard) instead of shortening the sequence only by one word at the beginning.",
        "This concept of introducing gaps in n-grams is referred to as skip n-grams (Ney et al., 1994; Huang et al., 1993).",
        "Among other techniques, skip n-grams have also been considered as an approach to overcome problems of data sparsity (Goodman, 2001).",
        "However, to best of our knowledge, language models making use of skip n-grams models have never been investigated to their full extent and over different levels of lower order models.",
        "Our approach differs as we consider all possible combinations of gaps in a local context and interpolate the higher order model with all possible lower order models derived from adding gaps in all different ways.",
        "In this paper we make the following contribu-tions: 1.",
        "We provide a framework for using modified Kneser-Ney smoothing in combination with a systematic exploration of lower order models based on skip n-grams.",
        "2.",
        "We show how our novel approach can indeed easily be interpreted as a generalized version of the current state-of-the-art language models.",
        "3.",
        "We present a large scale empirical analysis of our generalized language models on eight data sets spanning four different languages, namely, a wikipedia-based text corpus and the JRC-Acquis corpus of legislative texts.",
        "4.",
        "We empirically observe that introducing skip n-gram models may reduce perplexity by 12.7% compared to the current state-of-the-art using modified Kneser-Ney models on large data sets.",
        "Using small training data sets we observe even higher reductions of perplexity of up to 25.6%.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "We start with reviewing related work in Section 2.",
        "We will then introduce our generalized language models in Section 3.",
        "After explaining the evaluation methodology and introducing the data sets in Section 4 we will present the results of our evaluation in Section 5.",
        "In Section 6 we discuss why a generalized language model performs better than a standard language model.",
        "Finally, in Section 7 we summarize our findings and conclude with an overview of further interesting research challenges in the field of generalized language models.",
        "2 Related Work Work related to our generalized language model approach can be divided in two categories: various smoothing techniques for language models and approaches making use of skip n-grams.",
        "Smoothing techniques for language models have a long history.",
        "Their aim is to overcome data sparsity and provide more reliable estimators -- in particular for rare events.",
        "The Good Turing estimator (Good, 1953), deleted interpolation (Je- linek and Mercer, 1980), Katz backoff (Katz, 1987) and Kneser-Ney smoothing (Kneser and Ney, 1995) are just some of the approaches to be mentioned.",
        "Common strategies of these approaches are to either backoff to lower order models when a higher order model lacks sufficient training data for good estimation, to interpolate between higher and lower order models or to interpolate with a prior distribution.",
        "Furthermore, the estimation of the amount of unseen events from rare events aims to find the right weights for interpolation as well as for discounting probability mass from unreliable estimators and to retain it for unseen events.",
        "The state of the art is a modified version of Kneser-Ney smoothing introduced in (Chen and Goodman, 1999).",
        "The modified version implements a recursive interpolation with lower order models, making use of different discount values for more or less frequently observed events.",
        "This variation has been compared to other smoothing techniques on various corpora and has shown to outperform competing approaches.",
        "We will review modified Kneser-Ney smoothing in Section 2.1 in more detail as we reuse some ideas to define our generalized language model.",
        "1146 Smoothing techniques which do not rely on using lower order models involve clustering (Brown et al., 1992; Ney et al., 1994), i.e. grouping together similar words to form classes of words, as well as skip n-grams (Ney et al., 1994; Huang et al., 1993).",
        "Yet other approaches make use of permutations of the word order in n-grams (Schukat- Talamazzini et al., 1995; Goodman, 2001).",
        "Skip n-grams are typically used to incorporate long distance relations between words.",
        "Introducing the possibility of gaps between the words in an n-gram allows for capturing word relations beyond the level of n consecutive words without an exponential increase in the parameter space.",
        "How-ever, with their restriction on a subsequence of words, skip n-grams are also used as a technique to overcome data sparsity (Goodman, 2001).",
        "In related work different terminology and different definitions have been used to describe skip n-grams.",
        "Variations modify the number of words which can be skipped between elements in an n-gram as well as the manner in which the skipped words are determined (e.g. fixed patterns (Goodman, 2001) or functional words (Gao and Suzuki, 2005)).",
        "The impact of various extensions and smoothing techniques for language models is investigated in (Goodman, 2001; Goodman, 2000).",
        "In partic-ular, the authors compared Kneser-Ney smooth-ing, Katz backoff smoothing, caching, clustering, inclusion of higher order n-grams, sentence mixture and skip n-grams.",
        "They also evaluated combinations of techniques, for instance, using skip n-gram models in combination with Kneser-Ney smoothing.",
        "The experiments in this case followed two paths: (1) interpolating a 5-gram model with lower order distribution introducing a single gap and (2) interpolating higher order models with skip n-grams which retained only combinations of two words.",
        "Goodman reported on small data sets and in the best case a moderate improvement of cross entropy in the range of 0.02 to 0.04.",
        "In (Guthrie et al., 2006), the authors investigated the increase of observed word combinations when including skips in n-grams.",
        "The conclusion was that using skip n-grams is often more effective for increasing the number of observations than increasing the corpus size.",
        "This observation aligns well with our experiments.",
        "2.1 Review of Modified Kneser-Ney Smoothing We briefly recall modified Kneser-Ney Smoothing as presented in (Chen and Goodman, 1999).",
        "Modified Kneser-Ney implements smoothing by interpolating between higher and lower order n-gram language models.",

        "x + y since at least the two sequences w 1 w 2 w 3a w 4 and w 1 w 2 w 3b w 4 match the sequence w 1 w 2 w 4 .",
        "In order to align with standard language models the skip operator applied to the first word of a sequence will remove the word instead of introducing a wildcard.",

        "Mathematically one can see that the GLM includes the standard language model with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing as a sub model and is consequently a real generalization.",
        "In an empirical evaluation, we have demonstrated that for higher orders the GLM outperforms MKN for all test cases.",
        "The relative improvement in perplexity is up to 12.7% for large data sets.",
        "GLMs also performs particularly well on small and sparse sets of training data.",
        "On a very 1152 small training data set we observed a reduction of perplexity by 25.7%.",
        "Our experiments underline that the generalized language models overcome in particular the weaknesses of modified Kneser-Ney smoothing on sparse training data.",
        "7.2 Future work A desirable extension of our current definition of GLMs will be the combination of different lower lower order models in our generalized language model using different weights for each model.",
        "Such weights can be used to model the statistical reliability of the different lower order models.",
        "The value of the weights would have to be chosen according to the probability or counts of the respective skip n-grams.",
        "Another important step that has not been considered yet is compressing and indexing of generalized language models to improve the performance of the computation and be able to store them in main memory.",
        "Regarding the scalability of the approach to very large data sets we intend to apply the Map Reduce techniques from (Heafield et al., 2013) to our generalized language models in order to have a more scalable calculation.",
        "This will open the path also to another interesting experiment.",
        "Goodman (Goodman, 2001) observed that increasing the length of n-grams in combination with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing did not lead to improvements for values of n beyond 7.",
        "We believe that our generalized language models could still benefit from such an increase.",
        "They suffer less from the sparsity of long n-grams and can overcome this sparsity when interpolating with the lower order skip n-grams while benefiting from the larger context.",
        "Finally, it would be interesting to see how applications of language models?like next word prediction, machine translation, speech recogni-tion, text classification, spelling correction, e.g.?",
