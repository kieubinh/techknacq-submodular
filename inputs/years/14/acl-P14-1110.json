        "Topic models discover?without any supervision'the primary themes presented in a dataset: the namesake topics.",
        "Topic models have two primary applications: to aid human exploration of corpora (Chang et al., 2009) or serve as a low-dimensional representation for downstream applications.",
        "We focus on the second application, which has been fruitful for computer vision (Li Fei-Fei and Perona, 2005), computational biology (Perina et al., 2010), and information retrieval (Kataria et al., 2011).",
        "In particular, we use topic models to aid statistical machine translation (Koehn, 2009, SMT).",
        "Modern machine translation systems use millions of examples of translations to learn translation rules.",

        "indicates equal contributions.",
        "As we review in Section 2, topic models are a promising solution for automatically discovering domains in machine translation corpora.",
        "How-ever, past work either relies solely on monolingual source-side models (Eidelman et al., 2012; Hasler et al., 2012; Su et al., 2012), or limited modeling of the target side (Xiao et al., 2012).",
        "In contrast, machine translation uses inherently multilingual data: an SMT system must translate a phrase or sentence from a source language to a different target language, so existing applications of topic models (Eidelman et al., 2012) are wilfully ignoring available information on the target side that could aid domain discovery.",
        "This is not for a lack of multilingual topic models.",
        "Topic models bridge the chasm between languages using document connections (Mimno et al., 2009), dictionaries (Boyd-Graber and Resnik, 2010), and word alignments (Zhao and Xing, 2006).",
        "In Section 2, we review these models for discovering topics in multilingual datasets and discuss how they can improve SMT.",
        "However, no models combine multiple bridges between languages.",
        "In Section 3, we create a model?the polylingual tree-based topic models (ptLDA)?that uses information from both external dictionaries and document alignments simultaneously.",
        "In Section 4, we derive both MCMC and variational inference for this new topic model.",
        "In Section 5, we evaluate our model on the task of SMT using aligned datasets.",
        "We show that ptLDA offers better domain adaptation than other topic models for machine translation.",
        "Finally, in Section 6, we show how these topic models improve SMT with detailed examples.",

        "One popular method to estimate the probability p w (e?| ?",

        "The phrase pair probabilities p w (e?| ?",

        "Cross-Domain SMT A SMT system is usually trained on documents with the same genre (e.g., sports, business) from a similar style (e.g., newswire, blog-posts).",
        "These are called domains.",
        "Translations within one domain are better than translations across domains since they vary dramatically in their word choices and style.",
        "A correct translation in one domain may be inappropriate in another domain.",
        "For example, ????",
        "in a newspaper usually means ?underwater diving?.",
        "On social media, it means a non-contributing ?lurker?.",
        "Domain Adaptation for SMT Training a SMT system using diverse data requires domain adaptation.",

        "Chiang et al. (2011) combine these approaches by directly optimizing genre and collection features by computing separate translation tables for each domain.",
        "However, these approaches treat domains as hand-labeled, constant, and known a priori.",
        "This setup is at best expensive and at worst infeasible for large data.",
        "Topic models provide a solution where domains can be automatically induced from raw data: treat each topic as a domain.",
        "1 1 Henceforth we will use the term ?topic?",
        "and ?domain?",
        "interchangeably: ?topic?",

        "If each topic defines a SMT domain, the document's topic distribution is a soft domain assignment for that document.",
        "Given the soft domain assignments, Eidelman et al. (2012) extract lexical weighting features conditioned on the topics, optimizing feature weights using the Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (Cram- mer et al., 2006, MIRA).",

        "Conceptually, this approach is just reweighting examples.",
        "The probability of a topic given a document is never zero.",
        "Every translation observed in the training set will contribute to p k (e|f); many of the expected counts, however, will be less than one.",
        "This obviates the explicit smoothing used in other domain adaptation systems (Chiang et al., 2011).",
        "1167 We adopt this framework in its entirety.",
        "Our contribution are topics that capture multilingual information and thus better capture the domains in the parallel corpus.",
        "2.3 Beyond Vanilla Topic Models Eidelman et al. (2012) ignore a wealth of information that could improve topic models and help machine translation.",
        "Namely, they only use monolingual data from the source language, ignoring all target-language data and available lexical semantic resources between source and target languages.",
        "Different complement each other to reduce ambiguity.",
        "For example, ????",
        "in a Chinese document can be either ?hobbyhorse?",
        "in a children's topic, or ?Trojan virus?",
        "in a technology topic.",
        "A short Chinese context obscures the true topic.",
        "However, these terms are unambiguous in English, revealing the true topic.",
        "While vanilla topic models (LDA) can only be applied to monolingual data, there are a number of topic models for parallel corpora: Zhao and Xing (2006) assume aligned word pairs share same topics; Mimno et al. (2009) connect different languages through comparable documents.",
        "These models take advantage of word or document alignment information and infer more robust topics from the aligned dataset.",
        "On the other hand, lexical information can induce topics from multilingual corpora.",
        "For in-stance, orthographic similarity connects words with the same meaning in related languages (Boyd- Graber and Blei, 2009), and dictionaries are a more general source of information on which words share meaning (Boyd-Graber and Resnik, 2010).",
        "These two approaches are not mutually exclu-sive, however; they reveal different connections across languages.",
        "In the next section, we combine these two approaches into a polylingual tree-based topic model.",
        "3 Polylingual Tree-based Topic Models In this section, we bring existing tree-based topic models (Boyd-Graber et al., 2007, tLDA) and polylingual topic models (Mimno et al., 2009, pLDA) together and create the polylingual tree-based topic model (ptLDA) that incorporates both word-level correlations and document-level alignment information.",
        "Word-level Correlations Tree-based topic models incorporate the correlations between words by encouraging words that appear together in a concept to have similar probabilities given a topic.",
        "These concepts can come from WordNet (Boyd- Graber and Resnik, 2010), domain experts (An- drzejewski et al., 2009), or user constrains (Hu et al., 2013).",
        "When we gather concepts from bilingual resources, these concepts can connect different languages.",
        "For example, if a bilingual dictionary defines ????",
        "as ?computer?, we combine these words in a concept.",
        "We organize the vocabulary in a tree structure based on these concepts (Figure 1): words in the same concept share a common parent node, and then that concept becomes one of many children of the root node.",
        "Words that are not in any concept?",
        "uncorrelated words?are directly connected to the root node.",
        "We call this structure the tree prior.",
        "When this tree serves as a prior for topic models, words in the same concept are correlated in topics.",
        "For example, if ????",
        "has high probability in a topic, so will ?computer?, since they share the same parent node.",
        "With the tree priors, each topic is no longer a distribution over word types, instead, it is a distribution over paths, and each path is associated with a word type.",
        "The same word could appear in multiple paths, and each path represents a unique sense of this word.",
        "Document-level Alignments Lexical resources connect languages and help guide the topics.",
        "How-ever, these resources are sometimes brittle and may not cover the whole vocabulary.",
        "Aligned document pairs provide a more corpus-specific, flexible association across languages.",
        "Polylingual topic models (Mimno et al., 2009) assume that the aligned documents in different languages share the same topic distribution and each language has a unique topic distribution over its word types.",
        "This level of connection between languages is flexible: instead of requiring the exact matching on words and sentences, only a coarse document alignment is necessary, as long as the documents discuss the same topics.",
        "Combine Words and Documents We propose polylingual tree-based topic models (ptLDA), which connect information across different languages by incorporating both word correlation (as in tLDA) and document alignment information (as in pLDA).",
        "We initially assume a given tree struc-ture, deferring the tree's provenance to the end of this section.",
        "1168 Generative Process As in LDA, each word token is associated with a topic.",
        "However, tree-based topic models introduce an additional step of selecting a concept in a topic responsible for generating each word token.",
        "This is represented by a path y d,n through the topic's tree.",
        "The probability of a path in a topic depends on the transition probabilities in a topic.",

        "Dir(?",
        "i ).",
        "Each path ends in a word (i.e., a leaf node) and the probability of a path is the product of all of the transitions between topics it traverses.",
        "Topics have correlations over words because the Dirichlet parameters can encode positive or negative correlations (Andrzejewski et al., 2009).",
        "With these correlated in topics in hand, the generation of documents are very similar to LDA.",
        "For every document d, we first sample a distribution over topics ?",
        "d from a Dirichlet prior Dir(?).",
        "For every token in the documents, we first sample a topic z dn from the multinomial distribution ?",
