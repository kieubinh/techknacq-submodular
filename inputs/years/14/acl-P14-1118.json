        "Social media such as Twitter, Facebook or YouTube contain rapidly changing information generated by millions of users that can dramatically affect the reputation of a person or an organization.",
        "This raises the importance of automatic extraction of sentiments and opinions expressed in social media.",
        "YouTube is a unique environment, just like Twitter, but probably even richer: multi-modal, with a social graph, and discussions between people sharing an interest.",
        "Hence, doing sentiment research in such an environment is highly relevant for the community.",
        "While the linguistic conventions used on Twitter and YouTube indeed show similarities (Baldwin et al., 2013), focusing on YouTube allows to exploit context information, possibly also multi-modal information, not available in isolated tweets, thus rendering it a valuable resource for the future research.",
        "Nevertheless, there is almost no work showing effective OM on YouTube comments.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, the only exception is given by the classification system of YouTube comments proposed by Siersdorfer et al. (2010).",
        "While previous state-of-the-art models for opinion classification have been successfully applied to traditional corpora (Pang and Lee, 2008), YouTube comments pose additional challenges: (i) polarity words can refer to either video or product while expressing contrasting sentiments; (ii) many comments are unrelated or contain spam; and (iii) learning supervised models requires training data for each different YouTube domain, e.g., tablets, automobiles, etc.",
        "For example, consider a typical comment on a YouTube review video about a Motorola Xoom tablet: this guy really puts a negative spin on this , and I ?m not sure why , this seems crazy fast , and I ?m not entirely sure why his pinch to zoom his laggy all the other xoom reviews The comment contains a product name xoom and some negative expressions, thus, a bag-of-words model would derive a negative polarity for this product.",
        "In contrast, the opinion towards the product is neutral as the negative sentiment is expressed towards the video.",
        "Similarly, the following comment: iPad 2 is better.",
        "the superior apps just destroy the xoom.",
        "contains two positive and one negative word, yet the sentiment towards the product is negative (the negative word destroy refers to Xoom).",
        "Clearly, the bag-of-words lacks the structural information linking the sentiment with the target product.",
        "In this paper, we carry out a systematic study on OM targeting YouTube comments; its contribution is three-fold: firstly, to solve the problems outlined above, we define a classification schema, which separates spam and not related comments from the informative ones, which are, in turn, further categorized into video-or product-related comments 1252 (type classification).",
        "At the final stage, different classifiers assign polarity (positive, negative or neutral) to each type of a meaningful comment.",
        "This allows us to filter out irrelevant comments, providing accurate OM distinguishing comments about the video and the target product.",
        "The second contribution of the paper is the creation and annotation (by an expert coder) of a comment corpus containing 35k manually labeled comments for two product YouTube domains: tablets and automobiles.",
        "1 It is the first manually annotated corpus that enables researchers to use supervised methods on YouTube for comment classification and opinion analysis.",
        "The comments from different product domains exhibit different properties (cf. Sec.",
        "5.2), which give the possibility to study the domain adaptability of the supervised models by training on one category and testing on the other (and vice versa).",
        "The third contribution of the paper is a novel structural representation, based on shallow syntactic trees enriched with conceptual information, i.e., tags generalizing the specific topic of the video, e.g., iPad, Kindle, Toyota Camry.",
        "Given the complexity and the novelty of the task, we exploit structural kernels to automatically engineer novel features.",
        "In particular, we define an efficient tree kernel derived from the Partial Tree Kernel, (Mos- chitti, 2006a), suitable for encoding structural representation of comments into Support Vector Machines (SVMs).",
        "Finally, our results show that our models are adaptable, especially when the structural information is used.",
        "Structural models generally improve on both tasks ?",
        "polarity and type classification ?",
        "yielding up to 30% of relative im-provement, when little data is available.",
        "Hence, the impractical task of annotating data for each YouTube category can be mitigated by the use of models that adapt better across domains.",
        "2 Related work Most prior work on more general OM has been carried out on more standardized forms of text, such as consumer reviews or newswire.",
        "The most commonly used datasets include: the MPQA corpus of news documents (Wilson et al., 2005), web customer review data (Hu and Liu, 2004), Amazon review data (Blitzer et al., 2007), the JDPA 1 The corpus and the annotation guidelines are publicly available at: http://projects.disi.unitn.",
        "it/iKernels/projects/sentube/ corpus of blogs (Kessler et al., 2010), etc.",
        "The aforementioned corpora are, however, only partially suitable for developing models on social media, since the informal text poses additional challenges for Information Extraction and Natural Language Processing.",
        "Similar to Twitter, most YouTube comments are very short, the language is informal with numerous accidental and deliberate errors and grammatical inconsistencies, which makes previous corpora less suitable to train models for OM on YouTube.",
        "A recent study focuses on sentiment analysis for Twitter (Pak and Paroubek, 2010), however, their corpus was compiled automatically by searching for emoticons expressing positive and negative sentiment only.",
        "Siersdorfer et al. (2010) focus on exploiting user ratings (counts of ?thumbs up/down?",
        "as flagged by other users) of YouTube video comments to train classifiers to predict the community acceptance of new comments.",
        "Hence, their goal is different: predicting comment ratings, rather than predicting the sentiment expressed in a YouTube comment or its information content.",
        "Exploiting the information from user ratings is a feature that we have not exploited thus far, but we believe that it is a valuable feature to use in future work.",
        "Most of the previous work on supervised sentiment analysis use feature vectors to encode documents.",
        "While a few successful attempts have been made to use more involved linguistic analysis for opinion mining, such as dependency trees with latent nodes (T?ackstr?om and McDonald, 2011) and syntactic parse trees with vectorized nodes (Socher et al., 2011), recently, a comprehensive study by Wang and Manning (2012) showed that a simple model using bigrams and SVMs performs on par with more complex models.",
        "In contrast, we show that adding structural features from syntactic trees is particularly useful for the cross-domain setting.",
        "They help to build a system that is more robust across domains.",
        "Therefore, rather than trying to build a specialized system for every new target domain, as it has been done in most prior work on domain adaptation (Blitzer et al., 2007; Daum?e, 2007), the domain adaptation problem boils down to finding a more robust system (S?gaard and Johannsen, 2012; Plank and Moschitti, 2013).",
        "This is in line with recent advances in parsing the web (Petrov and McDonald, 2012), where participants where asked to build a single system able to cope with different yet re-1253 lated domains.",
        "Our approach relies on robust syntactic structures to automatically generate patterns that adapt better.",
        "These representations have been inspired by the semantic models developed for Question Answering (Moschitti, 2008; Severyn and Moschitti, 2012; Severyn and Moschitti, 2013) and Semantic Textual Similarity (Severyn et al., 2013).",
        "Moreover, we introduce additional tags, e.g., video concepts, polarity and negation words, to achieve better generalization across different domains where the word distribution and vocabulary changes.",
        "3 Representations and models Our approach to OM on YouTube relies on the design of classifiers to predict comment type and opinion polarity.",
        "Such classifiers are traditionally based on bag-of-words and more advanced features.",
        "In the next sections, we define a baseline feature vector model and a novel structural model based on kernel methods.",
        "3.1 Feature Set We enrich the traditional bag-of-word representation with features from a sentiment lexicon and features quantifying the negation present in the comment.",
        "Our model (FVEC) encodes each document using the following feature groups: word n-grams: we compute unigrams and bigrams over lower-cased word lemmas where binary values are used to indicate the pres-ence/absence of a given item.",
        "- lexicon: a sentiment lexicon is a collection of words associated with a positive or negative sentiment.",
        "We use two manually constructed sentiment lexicons that are freely available: the MPQA Lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005) and the lexicon of Hu and Liu (2004).",
        "For each of the lexicons, we use the number of words found in the comment that have positive and negative sentiment as a feature.",
        "- negation: the count of negation words, e.g., {don't, never, not, etc.",
        "}, found in a comment.",
        "2 Our structural representation (defined next) enables a more involved treatment of negation.",
        "video concept: cosine similarity between a comment and the title/description of the video.",
        "Most of the videos come with a title and a short descrip-tion, which can be used to encode the topicality of 2 The list of negation words is adopted from http://sentiment.christopherpotts.net/lingstruc.html each comment by looking at their overlap.",
        "3.2 Structural model We go beyond traditional feature vectors by employing structural models (STRUCT), which encode each comment into a shallow syntactic tree.",
        "These trees are input to tree kernel functions for generating structural features.",
        "Our structures are specifically adapted to the noisy user-generated texts and encode important aspects of the comments, e.g., words from the sentiment lexi-cons, product concepts and negation words, which specifically targets the sentiment and comment type classification tasks.",
        "In particular, our shallow tree structure is a two-level syntactic hierarchy built from word lemmas (leaves) and part-of-speech tags that are further grouped into chunks (Fig. 1).",
        "As full syntactic parsers such as constituency or dependency tree parsers would significantly degrade in performance on noisy texts, e.g., Twitter or YouTube comments, we opted for shallow structures, which rely on simpler and more robust components: a part-of-speech tagger and a chunker.",
        "Moreover, such taggers have been recently updated with models (Ritter et al., 2011; Gimpel et al., 2011) trained specifically to process noisy texts showing significant reductions in the error rate on user-generated texts, e.g., Twitter.",
        "Hence, we use the CMU Twitter pos-tagger (Gimpel et al., 2011; Owoputi et al., 2013) to obtain the part-of-speech tags.",
        "Our second component ?",
        "chunker ?",
        "is taken from (Ritter et al., 2011), which also comes with a model trained on Twitter data 3 and shown to perform better on noisy data such as user comments.",
        "To address the specifics of OM tasks on YouTube comments, we enrich syntactic trees with semantic tags to encode: (i) central concepts of the video, (ii) sentiment-bearing words expressing positive or negative sentiment and (iii) negation words.",
        "To automatically identify concept words of the video we use context words (to- kens detected as nouns by the part-of-speech tag-ger) from the video title and video description and match them in the tree.",
        "For the matched words, we enrich labels of their parent nodes (part-of- speech and chunk) with the PRODUCT tag.",
        "Sim-ilarly, the nodes associated with words found in 3 The chunker from (Ritter et al., 2011) relies on its own POS tagger, however, in our structural representations we fa-vor the POS tags from the CMU Twitter tagger and take only the chunk tags from the chunker.",
        "1254 Figure 1: Shallow tree representation of the example comment (labeled with product type and negative sentiment): ?iPad 2 is better.",
        "the superior apps just destroy the xoom.?",
        "(lemmas are replaced with words for readability) taken from the video ?Motorola Xoom Review?.",
        "We introduce additional tags in the tree nodes to encode the central concept of the video (motorola xoom) and sentiment-bearing words (better, superior, destroy) directly in the tree nodes.",
        "For the former we add a PRODUCT tag on the chunk and part-of-speech nodes of the word xoom) and polarity tags (positive and negative) for the latter.",
        "Two sentences are split into separate root nodes S. the sentiment lexicon are enriched with a polarity tag (either positive or negative), while negation words are labeled with the NEG tag.",
        "It should be noted that vector-based (FVEC) model relies only on feature counts whereas the proposed tree encodes powerful contextual syntactic features in terms of tree fragments.",
        "The latter are automatically generated and learned by SVMs with expressive tree kernels.",
        "For example, the comment in Figure 1 shows two positive and one negative word from the sentiment lexicon.",
        "This would strongly bias the FVEC sentiment classifier to assign a positive label to the comment.",
        "In contrast, the STRUCT model relies on the fact that the negative word, destroy, refers to the PRODUCT (xoom) since they form a verbal phase (VP).",
        "In other words, the tree frag-ment: [S [negative-VP [negative-V [destroy]] [PRODUCT-NP [PRODUCT-N [xoom]]]] is a strong feature (induced by tree kernels) to help the classifier to discriminate such hard cases.",
        "Moreover, tree kernels generate all possible subtrees, thus producing generalized (back-off) features, e.g., [S [negative-VP [negative-V [destroy]] [PRODUCT-NP]]]] or [S [negative-VP [PRODUCT-NP]]]].",
        "3.3 Learning We perform OM on YouTube using supervised methods, e.g., SVM.",
        "Our goal is to learn a model to automatically detect the sentiment and type of each comment.",
        "For this purpose, we build a multi-class classifier using the one-vs-all scheme.",
        "A binary classifier is trained for each of the classes and the predicted class is obtained by taking a class from the classifier with a maximum prediction score.",
        "Our back-end binary classifier is SVM-light-TK 4 , which encodes structural kernels in the SVM-light (Joachims, 2002) solver.",
        "We define a novel and efficient tree kernel function, namely, Shallow syntactic Tree Kernel (SHTK), which is as expressive as the Partial Tree Kernel (PTK) (Moschitti, 2006a) to handle feature engineering over the structural representations of the STRUCT model.",
        "A polynomial kernel of degree 3 is applied to feature vectors (FVEC).",
        "Combining structural and vector models.",
        "A typical kernel machine, e.g., SVM, classifies a test input x using the following prediction func-tion: h(x) = ?",
        "i ?",
        "i y i K(x,x i ), where ?",
        "i are the model parameters estimated from the training data, y i are target variables, x i are support vec-tors, and K(?, ?)",
        "is a kernel function.",
        "The latter computes the similarity between two comments.",
        "The STRUCT model treats each comment as a tu-ple x = ?T ,v?",
        "composed of a shallow syntactic tree T and a feature vector v .",
        "Hence, for each pair of comments x 1 and x 2 , we define the following comment similarity kernel: K(x 1 ,x 2 ) = K TK (T 1 ,T 2 ) +K v (v 1 , v 2 ), (1) where K TK computes SHTK (defined next), and K v is a kernel over feature vectors, e.g., linear, polynomial, Gaussian, etc.",
        "Shallow syntactic tree kernel.",
        "Following the convolution kernel framework, we define the new 4 http://disi.unitn.it/moschitti/Tree-Kernel.htm 1255 SHTK function from Eq. 1 to compute the similarity between tree structures.",
        "It counts the number of common substructures between two trees T 1 and T 2 without explicitly considering the whole fragment space.",
        "The general equations for Convolution Tree Kernels is: TK(T 1 , T 2 ) = ?",
        "n 1 ?N T 1 ?",
        "n 2 ?N T 2 ?",

        "(n 1 , n 2 ) is equal to the number of common fragments rooted in the n 1 and n 2 nodes, according to several possible definition of the atomic fragments.",
        "To improve the speed computation of TK, we consider pairs of nodes (n 1 , n 2 ) belonging to the same tree level.",
        "Thus, given H , the height of the STRUCT trees, where each level h contains nodes of the same type, i.e., chunk, POS, and lexical nodes, we define SHTK as the following 5 : SHTK(T 1 , T 2 ) = H ?",

        "Here, c n 1 (i) is the i th child of the node n 1 ; ~ I 1 and ~ I 2 are two sequences of indexes that enumerate subsets of children with gaps, i.e., ~ I = (i 1 , i 2 , .., |I|), with 1 ?",

        "It should be noted that: firstly, the use of a subsequence kernel makes it possible to generate child subsets of the two nodes, i.e., it allows for gaps, which makes matching of syntactic patterns 5 To have a similarity score between 0 and 1, a normalization in the kernel space, i.e. SHTK(T 1 ,T 2 ) ?",

        "3.2).",
        "When applied to STRUCT trees, SHTK exactly computes the same feature space as PTK, but in faster time (on average).",

        "chunk, POS or lexicals.",
        "This reduces the time for selecting the matching-node pairs carried out in PTK (Moschitti, 2006a; Moschitti, 2006b).",
        "The fragment space is obviously the same, as the node labels of different levels in STRUCT are different and will not be matched by PTK either.",
        "Finally, given its recursive definition in Eq. 3 and the use of subsequence (with gaps), SHTK can derive useful dependencies between its elements.",
        "For example, it will generate the following subtree fragments: [positive-NP [positive-A N]], [S [negative-VP [negative-V [destroy]] [PRODUCT-NP]]]] and so on.",

        "1257 notated as both positive and negative.",
        "For the sentiment task about 50% of the comments have neutral polarity, while the negative class is much less frequent.",
        "Inter-estingly, the ratios between polarities expressed in comments from AUTO and TABLETS are very similar across both TRAIN and TEST.",
        "Conversely, for the type task, we observe that comments from AUTO are uniformly distributed among the three classes, while for the TABLETS the majority of comments are product related.",
        "It is likely due to the nature of the TABLETS videos, that are more geek-oriented, where users are more prone to share their opinions and enter involved discussions about a product.",
        "Additionally, videos from the AUTO category (both commercials and user reviews) are more visually captivating and, being generally oriented towards a larger audience, generate more video-related comments.",
        "Regarding the full setting, where the goal is to have a joint prediction of the comment sentiment and type, we observe that video-negative and video-positive are the most scarce classes, which makes them the most difficult to predict.",
        "5.3 Results We start off by presenting the results for the traditional in-domain setting, where both TRAIN and TEST come from the same domain, e.g., AUTO or TABLETS.",

        "Firstly, we note that the performance on TABLETS is much higher than on AUTO across all tasks.",
        "This can be explained by the follow-ing: (i) TABLETS contains more training data and (ii) videos from AUTO and TABLETS categories draw different types of audiences ?",
        "well-informed users and geeks expressing better-motivated opinions about a product for the former vs. more general audience for the latter.",
        "This results in the different quality of comments with the AUTO being more challenging to analyze.",
        "Secondly, we observe that the STRUCT model provides 1-3% of absolute improvement in accuracy over FVEC for every task.",
        "For individual categories the F1 scores are also improved by the STRUCT model (except for the negative classes for AUTO, where we see a small drop).",
        "We conjecture that sentiment prediction for AUTO category is largely driven by one-shot phrases and statements where it is hard to improve upon the bag-of-words and sentiment lexicon features.",
        "In contrast, comments from TABLETS category tend to be more elaborated and well-argumented, thus, benefiting from the expressiveness of the structural representations.",
        "Considering per-class performance, correctly predicting negative sentiment is most difficult for both AUTO and TABLETS, which is probably caused by the smaller proportion of the negative comments in the training set.",
        "For the type task, video-related class is substantially more difficult than product-related for both categories.",
        "For the full task, the class video-negative accounts for the largest error.",
        "This is confirmed by the results from the previous sentiment and type tasks, where we saw that handling negative sentiment and detecting video-related comments are most difficult.",
        "5.3.2 Learning curves The learning curves depict the behavior of FVEC and STRUCT models as we increase the size of the training set.",
        "Intuitively, the STRUCT model relies on more general syntactic patterns and may overcome the sparseness problems incurred by the FVEC model when little training data is available.",
        "Nevertheless, as we see in Figure 2, the learning curves for sentiment and type classification tasks across both product categories do not confirm this intuition.",
        "The STRUCT model consistently outperforms the FVEC across all training sizes, but the gap in the performance does not increase when we move to smaller training sets.",
        "As we will see next, this picture changes when we perform the cross-domain study.",
