        "The bilingual lexicon extraction task from bilingual corpora was initially addressed by using parallel corpora (i.e. a corpus that contains source texts and their translation).",
        "However, despite good results in the compilation of bilingual lex-icons, parallel corpora are scarce resources, especially for technical domains and for language pairs not involving English.",
        "For these reasons, research in bilingual lexicon extraction has focused on another kind of bilingual corpora comprised of texts sharing common features such as domain, genre, sampling period, etc.",
        "without having a source text/target text relationship (McEnery and Xiao, 2007).",
        "These corpora, well known now as comparable corpora, have also initially been introduced as non-parallel corpora (Fung, 1995; Rapp, 1995), and non-aligned corpora (Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996).",
        "According to Fung and Che-ung (2004), who range bilingual corpora from parallel corpora to quasi-comparable corpora going through comparable corpora, there is a continuum from parallel to comparable corpora (i.e. a kind of filiation).",
        "The bilingual lexicon extraction task from comparable corpora inherits this filiation.",
        "For instance, the historical context-based projection method (Fung, 1995; Rapp, 1995), known as the standard approach, dedicated to this task seems implicitly to lead to work with balanced comparable corpora in the same way as for parallel corpora (i.e. each part of the corpus is composed of the same amount of data).",
        "In this paper we want to show that the assumption that comparable corpora should be balanced for bilingual lexicon extraction task is unfounded.",
        "Moreover, this assumption is prejudicial for specialized comparable corpora, especially when involving the English language for which many documents are available due the prevailing position of this language as a standard for international scientific publications.",
        "Within this context, our main contribution consists in a re-reading of the standard approach putting emphasis on the unfounded assumption of the balance of the specialized comparable corpora.",
        "In specialized do-mains, the comparable corpora are traditionally of small size (around 1 million words) in comparison with comparable corpus-based general language (up to 100 million words).",
        "Consequently, the observations of word co-occurrences which is the basis of the standard approach are unreliable.",
        "To make them more reliable, our second contribution is to contrast different regression models in order to boost the observations of word co-occurrences.",
        "This strategy allows to improve the quality of extracted bilingual lexicons from comparable corpora.",
        "1284 2 Bilingual Lexicon Extraction In this section, we first describe the standard approach that deals with the task of bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora.",
        "We then present an extension of this approach based on regression models.",
        "Finally, we discuss works related to this study.",
        "2.1 Standard Approach The main work in bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora is based on lexical context analysis and relies on the simple observation that a word and its translation tend to appear in the same lexical contexts.",
        "The basis of this observation consists in the identification of ?first-order affinities?",
        "for each source and target language: ?First-order affinities describe what other words are likely to be found in the immediate vicinity of a given word?",
        "(Grefenstette, 1994, p. 279).",
        "These affinities can be represented by context vec-tors, and each vector element represents a word which occurs within the window of the word to be translated (e.g. a seven-word window approximates syntactic dependencies).",
        "In order to emphasize significant words in the context vector and to reduce word-frequency effects, the context vectors are normalized according to an association measure.",
        "Then, the translation is obtained by comparing the source context vector to each translation candidate vector after having translated each element of the source vector with a general dictionary.",
        "The implementation of the standard approach can be carried out by applying the following three steps (Rapp, 1999; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002; D?ejean et al., 2002; Morin et al., 2007; Laroche and Langlais, 2010, among others): Computing context vectors We collect all the words in the context of each word i and count their occurrence frequency in a window of n words around i.",
        "For each word i of the source and the target languages, we obtain a context vector v i which gathers the set of co-occurrence words j associated with the number of times that j and i occur together cooc(i, j).",
        "In order to identify specific words in the lexical context and to reduce word-frequency effects, we normalize context vectors using an association score such as Mutual Information, Log-likelihood, or the discounted log-odds (LO) (Evert, 2005) (see equation 1 and Table 1 where N = a + b + c + d).",
        "Transferring context vectors Using a bilingual dictionary, we translate the elements of the source context vector.",
        "If the bilingual dictionary provides several translations for an ele-ment, we consider all of them but weight the different translations according to their frequency in the target language.",
        "Finding candidate translations For a word to be translated, we compute the similarity between the translated context vector and all target vectors through vector distance measures such as Jaccard or Cosine (see equation 2 where assoc i j stands for ?association score?, v k is the transferred context vector of the word k to translate, and v l is the context vector of the word l in the target lan-guage).",
        "Finally, the candidate translations of a word are the target words ranked following the similarity score.",
        "j ?j i a = cooc(i, j) b = cooc(i,?j) ?i c = cooc(?i, j) d = cooc(?i,?j) Table 1: Contingency table LO(i, j) = log (a + 1 2 ) ?",
        "(d + 1 2 ) (b + 1 2 ) ?",
        "(c + 1 2 ) (1) Cosine v k v l = ?",
        "t assoc l t assoc k t ?",
        "?",
        "t assoc l t 2 ?",
        "?",
        "t assoc k t 2 (2) This approach is sensitive to the choice of parameters such as the size of the context, the choice of the association and similarity measures.",
        "The most complete study about the influence of these parameters on the quality of word alignment has been carried out by Laroche and Langlais (2010).",
        "The standard approach is used by most researchers so far (Rapp, 1995; Fung, 1998; Peters and Picchi, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002; D?ejean et al., 2002; Gaussier et al., 2004; Morin et al., 2007; Laroche and Langlais, 2010; Prochasson and Fung, 2011; 1285 References Domain Languages Source/Target Sizes Tanaka and Iwasaki (1996) Newspaper EN/JP 30/33 million words Fung and McKeown (1997) Newspaper EN/JP 49/60 million bytes of data Rapp (1999) Newspaper GE/EN 135/163 million words Chiao and Zweigenbaum (2002) Medical FR/EN 602,484/608,320 words D?ejean et al.

        "As McEnery and Xiao (2007, p. 21) ob-serve, a specialized comparable corpus is built as balanced by analogy with a parallel corpus: ?Therefore, in relation to parallel corpora, it is more likely for comparable corpora to be designed as general balanced corpora.?.",
        "For instance, Table 2 describes the comparable corpora used in the main work dedicated to bilingual lexicon extraction for which the ratio between the size of the source and the target texts is comprised between 1 and 1.8.",
        "In fact, the assumption that words which have the same meaning in different languages should have the same lexical context distributions does not involve working with balanced comparable corpora.",
        "To our knowledge, no attention 1 has been paid to the problem of using unbalanced comparable corpora for bilingual lexicon extraction.",
        "Since the context vectors are computed from each part of the comparable corpus rather than through the parts of the comparable corpora, the standard approach is relatively insensitive to differences in corpus sizes.",
        "The only precaution for using the standard approach with unbalanced corpora is to normalize the association measure (for instance, this can be done by dividing each entry of a given context vector by the sum of its association scores).",
        "2.2 Prediction Model Since comparable corpora are usually small in specialized domains (see Table 2), the discrimina-1 We only found mention of this aspect in Diab and Finch (2000, p. 1501) ?In principle, we do not have to have the same size corpora in order for the approach to work?.",
        "tive power of context vectors (i.e. the observations of word co-occurrences) is reduced.",
        "One way to deal with this problem is to re-estimate co-occurrence counts by a prediction function (Hazem and Morin, 2013).",
        "This consists in assigning to each observed co-occurrence count of a small comparable corpora, a new value learned beforehand from a large training corpus.",
        "In order to make co-occurrence counts more discriminant and in the same way as Hazem and Morin (2013), one strategy consists in addressing this problem through regression: given training corpora of small and large size (abun- dant in the general domain), we predict word co-occurrence counts in order to make them more reliable.",
        "We then apply the resulting regression function to each word co-occurrence count as a pre-processing step of the standard approach.",
        "Our work differs from Hazem and Morin (2013) in two ways.",
        "First, while they experienced the linear regression model, we propose to contrast different regression models.",
        "Second, we apply regression to unbalanced comparable corpora and study the impact of prediction when applied to the source texts, the target texts and both source and target texts of the used comparable corpora.",
        "We use regression analysis to describe the relationship between word co-occurrence counts in a large corpus (the response variable) and word co-occurrence counts in a small corpus (the predictor variable).",
        "As most regression models have already been described in great detail (Christensen, 1997; Agresti, 2007), the derivation of most models is only briefly introduced in this work.",
        "As we can not claim that the prediction of word co-occurrence counts is a linear problem, we consider in addition to the simple linear regression 1286 model (Lin), a generalized linear model which is the logistic regression model (Logit) and non linear regression models such as polynomial regression model (Poly n ) of order n. Given an input vector x ?",
        "R m , where x 1 ,...,x m represent fea-tures, we find a prediction y?",
        "?",
        "R m for the co-occurrence count of a couple of words y ?",
        "R using one of the regression models presented below: y?",
        "Lin = ?",
        "0 + ?",
        "1 x (3) y?",

        "2 x 2 + ... + ?",
        "n x n (5) where ?",
        "i are the parameters to estimate.",
        "Let us denote by f the regression function and by cooc(w i , w j ) the co-occurrence count of the words w i and w j .",
        "The resulting predicted value of cooc(w i , w j ), noted ?cooc(w i , w j ) is given by the following equation: ?cooc(w i , w j ) = f(cooc(w i , w j )) (6) 2.3 Related Work In the past few years, several contributions have been proposed to improve each step of the standard approach.",
        "Prochasson et al. (2009) enhance the representativeness of the context vector by strengthening the context words that happen to be transliterated words and scientific compound words in the target language.",
        "Ismail and Manandhar (2010) also suggest that context vectors should be based on the most important contextually relevant words (in- domain terms), and thus propose a method for filtering the noise of the context vectors.",
        "In another way, Rubino and Linar`es (2011) improve the context words based on the hypothesis that a word and its candidate translations share thematic similarities.",
        "Yu and Tsujii (2009) and Otero (2007) pro-pose, for their part, to replace the window-based method by a syntax-based method in order to improve the representation of the lexical context.",
        "To improve the transfer context vectors step, and increase the number of elements of translated context vectors, Chiao and Zweigenbaum (2003) and Morin and Prochasson (2011) combine a standard general language dictionary with a specialized dictionary, whereas D?ejean et al. (2002) use the hierarchical properties of a specialized thesaurus.",
        "Koehn and Knight (2002) automatically induce the initial seed bilingual dictionary by using identical spelling features such as cognates and similar contexts.",
        "As regards the problem of words ambiguities, Bouamor et al. (2013) carried out word sense disambiguation process only in the target language whereas Gaussier et al. (2004) solve the problem through the source and target languages by using approaches based on CCA (Canonical Correlation Analysis) and multilingual PLSA (Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis).",
        "The rank of candidate translations can be improved by integrating different heuristics.",
        "For in-stance, Chiao and Zweigenbaum (2002) introduce a heuristic based on word distribution symmetry.",
        "From the ranked list of candidate translations, the standard approach is applied in the reverse direction to find the source counterparts of the first target candidate translations.",
        "And then only the target candidate translations that had the initial source word among the first reverse candidate translations are kept.",
        "Laroche and Langlais (2010) suggest a heuristic based on the graphic similarity between source and target terms.",
        "Here, candidate translations which are cognates of the word to be translated are ranked first among the list of translation candidates.",
        "3 Linguistic Resources In this section, we outline the different textual resources used for our experiments: the comparable corpora, the bilingual dictionary and the terminology reference lists.",
        "3.1 Specialized Comparable Corpora For our experiments, we used two specialized French/English comparable corpora: Breast cancer corpus This comparable corpus is composed of documents collected from the Elsevier website 2 .",
        "The documents were taken from the medical domain within the sub-domain of ?breast cancer?.",
        "We have automatically selected the documents published between 2001 and 2008 where the title or the keywords contain the term cancer du sein in French and breast cancer in English.",
        "We collected 130 French documents (about 530,000 words) and 1,640 English documents (about 2 http://www.elsevier.com 1287 7.4 million words).",
        "We split the English documents into 14 parts each containing about 530,000 words.",
        "Diabetes corpus The documents making up the French part of the comparable corpus have been craweled from the web using three keywords: diab`ete (diabetes), alimentation (food), and ob?esit?e (obesity).",
        "After a manual selection, we only kept the documents which were relative to the medical domain.",
        "As a result, 65 French documents were extracted (about 257,000 words).",
        "The English part has been extracted from the medical website PubMed 3 using the keywords: dia-betes, nutrition and feeding.",
        "We only kept the free fulltext available documents.",
        "As a re-sult, 2,339 English documents were extracted (about 3,5 million words).",
        "We also split the English documents into 14 parts each containing about 250,000 words.",
        "The French and English documents were then normalised through the following linguistic preprocessing steps: tokenisation, part-of-speech tag-ging, and lemmatisation.",
        "These steps were carried out using the TTC TermSuite 4 that applies the same method to several languages including French and English.",
        "Finally, the function words were removed and the words occurring less than twice in the French part and in each English part were discarded.",
        "Table 3 shows the number of distinct words (# words) after these steps.",
        "It also indicates the comparability degree in percentage (comp.)",
        "between the French part and each English part of each comparable corpus.",
        "The comparability measure (Li and Gaussier, 2010) is based on the expectation of finding the translation for each word in the corpus and gives a good idea about how two corpora are comparable.",
        "We can notice that all the comparable corpora have a high degree of comparability with a better comparability of the breast cancer corpora as opposed to the diabetes corpora.",

        "In the experiments reported here, the size of the context window w was set to 3 (i.e. a seven-word window that approximates syntactic dependencies), the retained association and similarity measures were the discounted log-odds and the Cosine (see Section 2.1).",

        "As a preliminary remark, we can notice that the results differ noticeably according to the comparable corpus used individually (MAP variation between 21.0% and 29.6% for the breast cancer corpora and between 10.5% and 16.5% for the diabetes corpora).",
        "We can also note that the MAP of all the unbalanced comparable corpora is always higher than any individual comparable corpus.",
        "Overall, starting with a MAP of 26.1% as provided by the balanced [breast cancer corpus 1], we are able to increase it to 42.3% with the unbalanced [breast cancer corpus 12] (the variation observed for some unbalanced corpora such as [diabetes corpus 12, 13 and 14] can be explained by the fact that adding more data in the source language increases the error rate of the translation phase of the standard approach, which leads to the introduction of additional noise in the translated context vectors).",

        "We contrast the simple linear regression model (Lin) with the second and the third order polynomial regressions (Poly 2 and Poly 3 ) and the logistic regression model (Logit).",

        "Also, as we can see, the results obtained with the linear and polynomial regressions are very close.",
        "This suggests that both linear and polynomial regressions are suitable as a preprocessing step of the standard approach, while the logistic regression seems to be inappropriate according to the results shown in Table 6.",
        "That said, the gain of regression models is not significant.",
        "This may be due to the regression parameters that have been learned from a training corpus of the general domain.",
        "Another reason that could explain these results is the prediction process.",
        "We applied the same regression function to all co-occurrence counts while learning models for low and high frequencies should have been more appropriate.",

        "Finally, predicting both sides may simulate a large comparable corpora on both sides.",
        "In this experi-ment, we chose to use the linear regression model (Lin) for the prediction part.",
        "That said, the other regression models have shown the same behavior as Lin.",
        "We can see that the best results are obtained by the Source pred approach for both comparable corpora.",
        "We can also notice that predicting the target side and both sides of the comparable corpora degrades the results.",
        "It is not surprising that predicting the target side only leads to lower results, since it is well known that a better characterization of a word to translate (given from the source side) leads to better results.",
        "We can deduce from Table 5 that source prediction is the most appropriate configuration to improve the quality of extracted lexicons.",
        "This configuration which simulates the use of unbalanced corpora leads us to think that using prediction with unbalanced comparable corpora should also increase the performance of the standard approach.",

        "Figure 1(a) illustrates the results of the experiments conducted on the breast cancer corpus.",
        "We can see that the Unbalanced approach significantly outperforms the baseline (Balanced).",
        "The big difference between the Balanced and the Unbalanced approaches would indicate that the latter is optimal.",
        "We can also notice that the prediction model applied to the balanced corpus (Balanced + Prediction) slightly outperforms the baseline while the Unbalanced+Prediction approach significantly outperforms the three other approaches (moreover the variation observed with the Unbalanced approach are lower than the Unbalanced + Prediction approach).",
        "Overall, the prediction increases the performance of the standard approach especially for unbalanced corpora.",
        "The results of the experiments conducted on the diabetes corpus are shown in Figure 1(b).",
        "As for the previous experiment, we can see that the Unbalanced approach significantly outperforms the Balanced approach.",
        "This confirms the unbalanced hypothesis and would motivate the use of unbalanced corpora when they are available.",
        "We can also notice that the Balanced + Prediction approach slightly outperforms the baseline while the Unbalanced+Prediction approach gives the best results.",
        "Here also, the prediction increases the performance of the standard approach especially for unbalanced corpora.",
        "It is clear that in addition to the benefit of using unbalanced comparable 1291 corpora, prediction shows a positive impact on the performance of the standard approach.",
        "5 Conclusion In this paper, we have studied how an unbalanced specialized comparable corpus could influence the quality of the bilingual lexicon extraction.",
        "This aspect represents a significant interest when working with specialized comparable corpora for which the quantity of the data collected may differ depending on the languages involved, especially when involving the English language as many scientific documents are available.",
        "More precisely, our different experiments show that using an unbalanced specialized comparable corpus always improves the quality of word translations.",
        "Thus, the MAP goes up from 29.6% (best result on the balanced corpora) to 42.3% (best result on the unbalanced corpora) in the breast cancer domain, and from 16.5% to 26.0% in the diabetes domain.",
        "Addition-ally, these results can be improved by using a prediction model of the word co-occurrence counts.",
        "Here, the MAP goes up from 42.3% (best result on the unbalanced corpora) to 46.9% (best result on the unbalanced corpora with prediction) in the breast cancer domain, and from 26.0% to 29.8% in the diabetes domain.",
        "We hope that this study will pave the way for using specialized unbalanced comparable corpora for bilingual lexicon extraction.",
