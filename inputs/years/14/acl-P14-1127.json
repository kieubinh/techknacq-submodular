        "In many applications in human language technologies (HLT), the goal is to generate text in a target language, using its standard orthography.",
        "Typical examples include automatic speech recognition (ASR, also known as STT or speech-to-text), optical character recognition (OCR), or machine translation (MT) into a target language.",
        "We will call such HLT applications ?target-language generation technologies?",
        "(TLGT).",
        "The best-performing systems for these applications today rely on training on large amounts of data: in the case of ASR, the data is aligned audio and transcription, plus large unannotated data for the language model-ing; in the case of OCR, it is transcribed optical data; in the case of MT, it is aligned bitexts.",
        "More data provides for better results.",
        "For languages with rich resources, such as English, more data is often the best solution, since the required data is readily available (including bitexts), and the cost of annotating (e.g., transcribing) data is outweighed by the potential significance of the systems that the data will enable.",
        "Thus, in HLT, improvements in quality are often brought about by using larger data sets (Banko and Brill, 2001).",
        "When we move to low-resource languages, the solution of simply using more data becomes less appealing.",
        "Unannotated data is less readily avail-able: for example, at the time of publishing this paper, 55% of all websites are in English, the top 10 languages collectively account for 90% of web presence, and the top 36 languages have a web presence that covers at least 0.1% of web sites.",
        "1 All other languages (and all languages considered in this paper except Persian) have a web presence of less than 0.1%.",
        "Considering Wikipedia, another resource often used in HLT, English has 4.4 million articles, while only 48 other languages have more than 100,000.",
        "2 As attention turns to developing HLT for more languages, including low-resource languages, alternatives to ?more-data?",
        "approaches become important.",
        "At the same time, it is often not possible to use knowledge-rich approaches.",
        "For low-resource lan-guages, resources such as morphological analyz-ers are not usually available, and even good scholarly descriptions of the morphology (from which a tool could be built) are often not available.",
        "The challenge is therefore to use data, but to make do with a small amount of data, and thus to use data better.",
        "This paper is a contribution to this goal.",
        "Specifically, we address TLGTs, i.e., the types of HLT mentioned above that generate target language text.",
        "We propose a new approach to generating unseen words of the target language which have not been seen in the training data.",
        "Our approach is entirely unsupervised.",
        "It assumes that word-units are specified, typically by whitespace and punctuation.",
        "1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Languages_used_on_the_Internet 2 http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_ of_Wikipedias 1349 Expanding the vocabulary of the target language can be useful for TLGTs in different ways.",
        "For ASR and OCR, which can compose words from smaller units (phones or graphically recognized letters), an expanded target language vocabulary can be directly exploited without the need for changing the technology at all: the new words need to be inserted into the relevant resources (lex- icon, language model) etc, with appropriately estimated probabilities.",
        "In the case of MT into morphologically rich low-resource languages, morphological segmentation is typically used in developing the translation models to reduce sparsity, but this does not guarantee against generating wrong word combinations.",
        "The expanded word combinations can be used to extend the language models used for MT to bias against incoherent hypothesized new sequences of segmented words.",
        "Our approach relies on unsupervised morphological segmentation.",
        "We do not in this paper contribute to research in unsupervised morphological segmentation; we only use it.",
        "The contribution of this paper lies in proposing how to use the results of unsupervised morphological segmentation in order to generate unseen words of the language.",
        "We investigate several ways of doing so, and we test them on seven low-resource languages.",
        "These languages have very different morphological prop-erties, and we show how our results differ depending on the morphological complexity of the language.",
        "In our best result (on Assamese), we show that our approach can predict 29% of the token-based out-of-vocabulary with a small amount of unlabeled training data.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "We first discuss related work in Section 2.",
        "We then present our method in Section 3, and present experimental results in Section 4.",
        "We conclude with a discussion of future work in Section 5.",
        "2 Related Work Approaches to Morphological Modeling Computational morphology is a very active area of research with a multitude of approaches that vary in the degree of manual annotation needed, and the amount of machine learning used.",
        "At one extreme, we find systems that are painstakingly and carefully designed by hand (Koskenniemi, 1983; Buckwalter, 2004; Habash and Rambow, 2006; D?etrez and Ranta, 2012).",
        "Next on the continuum, we find work that focuses on defining morphological models with limited lexica that are then extended using raw text (Cl?ement et al., 2004; Forsberg et al., 2006).",
        "In the middle of this continuum, we find efforts to learn complete paradigms using fully supervised methods relying on completely annotated data points with rich morphological information (Durrett and DeNero, 2013; Eskander et al., 2013).",
        "Next, there is work on minimally supervised methods that use available resources such as dictionaries, bitexts, and other additional morphological annotations (Yarowsky and Wicentowski, 2000; Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 2002; Neuvel and Fulop, 2002; Snyder and Barzilay, 2008).",
        "At the other extreme, we find unsupervised methods that learn morphology models from unannotated data (Creutz and Lagus, 2007; Monson et al., 2008; Dreyer and Eisner, 2011; Sirts and Goldwater, 2013).",
        "The work we present in this paper makes no use of any morphological annotations whatsoever, yet we are quite distinct from the approaches cited above.",
        "We compare our work to two efforts specifically.",
        "First, consider work in automatic morphological segmentation learning from unannotated data (Creutz and Lagus, 2007; Monson et al., 2008).",
        "Unlike these approaches which provide segmentations for training data and produce models that can be used to segment unseen words, our approach can generate words that have not been seen in the training data.",
        "The focus of efforts is rather complementary: we actually use an off-the-shelf unsupervised segmentation system (Creutz and Lagus, 2007) as part of our approach.",
        "Second, consider paradigm completion methods such as the work of Dreyer and Eisner (2011).",
        "This effort is closely related to our work although unlike it, we make no assumptions about the data and do not introduce any restrictions along the lines of deriva-tion/inflectional morphology: Dreyer and Eisner (2011) limited their work to verbal paradigms and used annotated training data in addition to basic assumptions about the problem such as the size of the paradigms.",
        "In our approach, we have zero annotated information and we do not distinguish between inflectional and derivational morphology, nor do we limit ourselves to a specific part-of-speech (POS).",
        "Vocabulary Expansion in HLT There have been diverse approaches towards dealing with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in ASR.",
        "In some models, the approach is to expand the lexicon by 1350 adding new words or pronunciations.",
        "Ohtsuki et al. (2005) propose a two-run model where in the first run, the input speech is recognized by the reference vocabulary and relevant words are extracted from the vocabulary database and added thereafter to the reference vocabulary to build an expanded lexicon.",
        "Word recognition is done in the second run based on the lexicon.",
        "Lei et al. (2009) expanded the pronunciation lexicon via generating all possible pronunciations for a word before lattice generation and indexation.",
        "There are also other methods for generating abbreviations in voice search systems such as Yang et al. (2012).",
        "While all of these approaches involve lexicon ex-pansion, they do not employ any morphological information.",
        "In the context of MT, several researchers have addressed the problem of OOV words by relating them to known in-vocabulary (INV) words.",
        "Yang and Kirchhoff (2006) anticipated OOV words that are potentially morphologically related using phrase-based backoff models.",
        "Habash (2008) considered different techniques for vocabulary expansion online.",
        "One of their techniques learned models of morphological mapping between morphologically rich source words in Arabic that produce the same English translation.",
        "This was used to relate an OOV word to a morphologically related INV word.",
        "Another technique expanded the MT phrase tables with possible transliterations and spelling alternatives.",
        "3 Morphology-based Vocabulary Expansion 3.1 Approach Our approach to morphology-based vocabulary expansion consists of three steps (Figure 1).",
        "We start with a ?training?",
        "corpus of (unannotated) words and generate a list of new (unseen) words that expands the vocabulary of the training corpus.",
        "1.",
        "Unsupervised Morphology Segmentation The first step is to segment each word in the training corpus into sequences of prefixes, stem and suffixes, where the prefixes and suffixes are optional.",
        "3 2.",
        "FST-based Morphology Expansion We then construct new word models using the 3 In this paper, we use an off-the-shelf system for this step but plan to explore new methods in the future, such as joint segmentation and expansion.",
        "segmented stems and affixes.",
        "We explore two different techniques for morphology-based vocabulary expansion that we discuss below.",
        "The output of these models is represented as a weighted finite state machine (WFST).",
        "3.",
        "Reranking Models Given that the size of the expanded vocabulary can be quite large and it may include a lot of over-generation, we rerank the expanded set of words before taking the top n words to use in downstream processes.",
        "We consider four reranking conditions which we describe below.",
        "Training Transcripts Unsupervised Morphology Segmentation Segmented Words FST-based Expansion Model Expanded List Reranking Reranked Expansion Figure 1: The flowchart of the lexicon expansion system.",
        "3.2 Morphology Expansion Techniques As stated above, the input to the morphology expansion step is a list of words segmented into mor-phemes: zero or more prefixes, one stem, and zero or more suffixes.",
        "Figure 2a presents an example of such input using English words (for clarity).",
        "We use two different models of morphology expansion in this paper: Fixed Affix model and Bigram Affix model.",
        "3.2.1 Fixed Affix Expansion Model In the Fixed Affix model, we construct a set of fused prefixes from all the unique prefix sequences in the training data; and we similarly construct a 1351 re+ pro+ duc +e func +tion +al re+ duc +e re+ duc +tion +s in pro+ duct concept +u +al + ly (a) Training data with morpheme boundaries.",

        "In our experiments, we used weighted finite state machine.",
        "We use character-based WFST in the implementation to facilitate analyzing inputs as well as word generation.",
        "set of fused suffixes from all the unique suffix sequences in the training data.",
        "In other words, we simply pick characters from beginning of the word up to the first stem as the prefix and characters from the first suffix to the end of the word as the suffix.",
        "Everything in the middle is the stem.",
        "In this model, each word has one single prefix and one single suffix (each of which can be empty in-dependently).",
        "The Fixed Affix model is simply the concatenation of the disjunction of all prefixes with the disjunction of all stems and the disjunction of all suffixes into one FST: prefix?",
        "stem?",
        "suffix The morpheme paths in the FST are weighted to reflect their probability in the training corpus.",
        "4 Figure 2b exemplifies a Fixed Affix model derived from the example training data in Figure 2a.",
        "4 We convert the probability into a cost by taking the negative of the log of the probability.",
        "3.2.2 Bigram Affix Expansion Model In the Bigram Affix model, we do the same for the stem as in the Fixed Affix model, but for prefixes and suffixes, we create a bigram language model in the finite state machine.",
        "The advantage of this technique is that unseen compound affixes can be generated by our model.",
        "For example, the Fixed Affix model in Figure 2b cannot generate the word func+tion+al+ly since the suffix +tionally is not seen in the training data.",
        "However, this word can be generated in the Bigram Affix model as shown in Figure 2c: there is a path passing 0?",

        "2 ?",
        "5 ?",
        "6 ?",
        "3 in the FST that can produce this word.",
        "We expect this model to have better recall for generating new words in the language because of its affixation flexibility.",
        "3.3 Reranking Techniques The expanded models allow for a large number of words to be generated.",
        "We limit the number of vocabulary expansion using different thresholds after reranking or reweighing the WFSTs generated 1352 above.",
        "We consider four reranking conditions.",
        "3.3.1 No Reranking (NRR) The baseline reranking option is no reranking (NRR).",
        "In this approach we use the weights in the WFST, which are based on the independent prefix/stem/suffix probabilities, to determine the ranking of the expanded vocabulary.",
        "3.3.2 Trigraph-based Reweighting (W?Tr) We reweight the weights in the WFST model (Fixed or Bigram) by composing it with a letter trigraph language model (W?Tr).",
        "A letter trigraph LM is itself a WFST where each trigraph (a sequence of three consequent letters) has an associated weight equal to its negative log-likelihood in the training data.",
        "This reweighting allows us to model preferences of sequences of word letters seen more in the training data.",
        "For example, in a word like producttions, the trigraphs ctt and tti are very rare and thus decrease its probability.",
        "3.3.3 Trigraph-based Reranking (TRR) When we compose our initial WFST with the trigraph FST, the probability of each generated word from the new FST is equal to the product of the probability of its morphemes and the probabilities of each trigraph in that word.",
        "This basically makes the model prefer shorter words and may degrade the effect of morphology information.",
        "Instead of reweighting the WFST, we get the n-best list of generated words and rerank them using their trigraph probabilities.",
        "We will refer to this technique as TRR.",
        "3.3.4 Reranking Morpheme Boundaries (BRR) The last reranking technique reranks the n-best generated word list with trigraphs that are incident on the morpheme boundaries (in case of Bigram Affix model, the last prefix and first suffix).",
        "The intuition is that we already know that any morpheme that is generated from the morphology FST is already seen in the training data but the boundary for different morphemes are not guaranteed to be seen in the training data.",
        "For example, for the word producttions, we only take into account the trigraphs rod, odu, ctt and tti instead of all possible trigraphs.",
        "We will refer to this technique as BRR.",
        "4 Evaluation 4.1 Evaluation Data and Tools Evaluation Data The IARPA Babel program is a research program for developing rapid spoken detection systems for under-resourced languages (Harper, 2013).",
        "We use the IARPA Babel program limited language pack data which consists of 20 hours of telephone speech with transcription.",
        "We use six languages which are known to have rich morphology: Assamese (IARPA- babel102b-v0.5a), Bengali (IARPA-babel103b- v0.4b), Pashto (IARPA-babel104b-v0.4bY), Tagalog (IARPA-babel106-v0.2g), Turkish (IARPA- babel105b-v0.4) and Zulu (IARPA-babel206b- v0.1e).",
        "Speech annotation such as silences and hesitations are removed from transcription and all words are turned into lower-case (for languages using the Roman script ?",

        "We also conduct further experiments on just verbs and nouns in the data set for Persian (Persian-N and Persian V).",

        "In order to study the effect of vocabulary expansion more deeply, we trained a subset of all nouns and verbs in the same dataset (also shown in Table 1).",
        "Verbs in Persian have rich but more or less regular morphology, while nouns, which have many irregular cases, have rich morphology but not as rich as verbs.",
        "The results in Table 4 show that Morfessor captures these phenomena.",
