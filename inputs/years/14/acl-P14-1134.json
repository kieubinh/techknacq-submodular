        "Semantic parsing is the problem of mapping natural language strings into meaning representations.",
        "Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) (Banarescu et al., 2013; Dorr et al., 1998) is a semantic formalism in which the meaning of a sentence is encoded as a rooted, directed, acyclic graph.",
        "Nodes represent concepts, and labeled directed edges represent the relationships between them?see Figure 1 for an example AMR graph.",
        "The formalism is based on propositional logic and neo-Davidsonian event representations (Parsons, 1990; Davidson, 1967).",
        "Although it does not encode quantifiers, tense, or modality, the set of semantic phenomena included in AMR were selected with natural language applications -- in particular, machine translation -- in mind.",
        "In this paper we introduce JAMR, the first published system for automatic AMR parsing.",
        "The system is based on a statistical model whose parameters are trained discriminatively using annotated sentences in the AMR Bank corpus (Banarescu et al., 2013).",
        "We evaluate using the Smatch score (Cai and Knight, 2013), establishing a baseline for future work.",
        "The core of JAMR is a two-part algorithm that first identifies concepts using a semi-Markov model and then identifies the relations that obtain between these by searching for the maximum spanning connected subgraph (MSCG) from an edge-labeled, directed graph representing all possible relations between the identified concepts.",
        "To solve the latter problem, we introduce an apparently novel O(|V | 2 log |V |) algorithm that is similar to the maximum spanning tree (MST) algorithms that are widely used for dependency parsing (McDonald et al., 2005).",
        "Our MSCG algorithm returns the connected subgraph with maximal sum of its edge weights from among all connected subgraphs of the input graph.",
        "Since AMR imposes additional constraints to ensure semantic well-formedness, we use Lagrangian relaxation (Geoffrion, 1974; Fisher, 2004) to augment the MSCG algorithm, yielding a tractable iterative algorithm that finds the optimal solution subject to these constraints.",
        "In our experiments, we have found this algorithm to converge 100% of the time for the constraint set we use.",
        "The approach can be understood as an alternative to parsing approaches using graph transducers such as (synchronous) hyperedge replacement grammars (Chiang et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2012; Drewes et al., 1997), in much the same way that spanning tree algorithms are an alternative to using shift-reduce and dynamic programming algorithms for dependency parsing.",

        ".",
        ".",
        ", w n ?, each w i a member of vocabulary W .",
        "The second stage connects the concepts by adding L E -labeled edges capturing the relations between concepts, and selects a root in G corresponding to the focus of the sentence w. Concept identification (?3) involves segmenting w into contiguous spans and assigning to each span a graph fragment corresponding to a concept from a concept set denoted F (or to ?",
        "for words that evoke no concept).",
        "In ?5 we describe how F is constructed.",
        "In our formulation, spans are contiguous subsequences of w. For example, the words ?New York City?",
        "can evoke the fragment represented by (c / city :name (n / name :op1 \"New\" :op2 \"York\" :op3 \"City\")))) We use a sequence labeling algorithm to identify concepts.",
        "The relation identification stage (?4) is similar to a graph-based dependency parser.",
        "Instead of finding the maximum-scoring tree over words, it finds the maximum-scoring connected subgraph that preserves concept fragments from the first stage, links each pair of vertices by at most one edge, and is deterministic 2 with respect to a special set of edge labels L ?",

        "L E .",
        "The set L ?",
        "E consists of the labels ARG0?ARG5, and does not include labels such as MOD or MANNER, for example.",
        "Linguistically, the determinism constraint enforces that predicates have at most one semantic argument of each type; this is discussed in more detail in ?4.",
        "To train the parser, spans of words must be labeled with the concept fragments they evoke.",
        "Although AMR Bank does not label concepts with the words that evoke them, it is possible to build an automatic aligner (?5).",
        "The alignments are used to construct the concept lexicon and to train the concept identification and relation identification stages of the parser (?6).",
        "Each stage is a discriminatively-trained linear structured predictor with rich features that make use of part-of-speech tagging, named entity tagging, and dependency parsing.",
        "In ?7, we evaluate the parser against gold-standard annotated sentences from the AMR Bank corpus (Banarescu et al., 2013) under the Smatch score (Cai and Knight, 2013), presenting the first published results on automatic AMR parsing.",
