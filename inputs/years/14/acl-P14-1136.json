        "Distributed representations of words have proved useful for a number of tasks.",
        "By providing richer representations of meaning than what can be encompassed in a discrete representation, such approaches have successfully been applied to tasks such as sentiment analysis (Socher et al., 2011), topic classification (Klementiev et al., 2012) or word-word similarity (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008).",
        "We present a new technique for semantic frame identification that leverages distributed word representations.",
        "According to the theory of frame semantics (Fillmore, 1982), a semantic frame represents an event or scenario, and possesses frame elements (or semantic roles) that participate in the ?",
        "The majority of this research was carried out during an internship at Google.",
        "event.",
        "Most work on frame-semantic parsing has usually divided the task into two major subtasks: frame identification, namely the disambiguation of a given predicate to a frame, and argument identification (or semantic role labeling), the analysis of words and phrases in the sentential context that satisfy the frame's semantic roles (Das et al., 2010; Das et al., 2014).",
        "1 Here, we focus on the first subtask of frame identification for given predicates; we use our novel method (?3) in conjunction with a standard argument identification model (?4) to perform full frame-semantic parsing.",
        "We present experiments on two tasks.",
        "First, we show that for frame identification on the FrameNet corpus (Baker et al., 1998; Fillmore et al., 2003), we outperform the prior state of the art (Das et al., 2014).",
        "Moreover, for full frame-semantic parsing, with the presented frame identification technique followed by our argument identification method, we report the best results on this task to date.",
        "Sec-ond, we present results on PropBank-style semantic role labeling (Palmer et al., 2005; Meyers et al., 2004; M`arquez et al., 2008), that approach strong baselines, and are on par with prior state of the art (Punyakanok et al., 2008).",
        "2 Overview Early work in frame-semantic analysis was pioneered by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002).",
        "Subsequent work in this area focused on either the FrameNet or PropBank frameworks, and research on the latter has been more popular.",
        "Since the CoNLL 2004-2005 shared tasks (Carreras and M`arquez, 1 There are exceptions, wherein the task has been modeled using a pipeline of three classifiers that perform frame iden-tification, a binary stage that classifies candidate arguments, and argument identification on the filtered candidates (Baker et al., 2007; Johansson and Nugues, 2007).",

        "2004; Carreras and M`arquez, 2005) on PropBank semantic role labeling (SRL), it has been treated as an important NLP problem.",
        "However, research has mostly focused on argument analysis, skipping the frame disambiguation step, and its interaction with argument identification.",
        "2.1 Frame-Semantic Parsing Closely related to SRL, frame-semantic parsing consists of the resolution of predicate sense into a frame, and the analysis of the frame's arguments.",
        "Work in this area exclusively uses the FrameNet full text annotations.",
        "Johansson and Nugues (2007) presented the best performing system at SemEval 2007 (Baker et al., 2007), and Das et al. (2010) improved performance, and later set the current state of the art on this task (Das et al., 2014).",
        "We briefly discuss FrameNet, and subsequently PropBank annotation conventions here.",
        "FrameNet The FrameNet project (Baker et al., 1998) is a lexical database that contains information about words and phrases (represented as lemmas conjoined with a coarse part-of-speech tag) termed as lexical units, with a set of semantic frames that they could evoke.",
        "For each frame, there is a list of associated frame elements (or roles, henceforth), that are also distinguished as core or non-core.",
        "2 Sentences are annotated using this universal frame inventory.",
        "For exam-ple, consider the pair of sentences in Figure 1(a).",
        "COMMERCE BUY is a frame that can be evoked by morphological variants of the two example lexical units buy.V and sell.V.",
        "Buyer, Seller and Goods are some example roles for this frame.",
        "2 Additional information such as finer distinction of the coreness properties of roles, the relationship between frames, and that of roles are also present, but we do not leverage that information in this work.",
        "PropBank The PropBank project (Palmer et al., 2005) is another popular resource related to semantic role labeling.",
        "The PropBank corpus has verbs annotated with sense frames and their arguments.",
        "Like FrameNet, it also has a lexical database that stores type information about verbs, in the form of sense frames and the possible semantic roles each frame could take.",
        "There are modifier roles that are shared across verb frames, somewhat similar to the non-core roles in FrameNet.",
        "Figure 1(b) shows annotations for two verbs ?bought?",
        "and ?sold?, with their lemmas (akin to the lexical units in FrameNet) and their verb frames buy.01 and sell.01.",
        "Generic core role labels (of which there are seven, namely A0-A5 and AA) for the verb frames are marked in the figure.",
        "3 A key difference between the two annotation systems is that PropBank uses a local frame inven-tory, where frames are predicate-specific.",
        "More-over, role labels, although few in number, take specific meaning for each verb frame.",
        "Figure 1 highlights this difference: while both sell.V and buy.V are members of the same frame in FrameNet, they evoke different frames in PropBank.",
        "In spite of this difference, nearly identical statistical models could be employed for both frameworks.",
        "Modeling In this paper, we model the frame-semantic parsing problem in two stages: frame identification and argument identification.",
        "As mentioned in ?1, these correspond to a frame disambiguation stage, 4 and a stage that finds the various arguments that fulfill the frame's semantic roles within the sentence, respectively.",
        "This resembles the framework of Das et al. (2014), who solely focus on FrameNet corpora, unlike this paper.",
        "The novelty of this paper lies in the frame identification stage (?3).",
        "Note that this two-stage approach is unusual for the PropBank corpora when compared to prior work, where the vast majority of published papers have not focused on the verb frame disambiguation problem at all, only focusing on the role labeling stage (see the overview paper of M`arquez et al. (2008) for example).",
        "3 NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004) is a similar resource for nominal predicates, but we do not consider it in our experiments.",
        "4 For example in PropBank, the lexical unit buy.V has three verb frames and in sentential context, we want to disambiguate its frame.",
        "(Although PropBank never formally uses the term lexical unit, we adopt its usage from the frame semantics literature.)",
        "1449 2.2 Distributed Frame Identification We present a model that takes word embeddings as input and learns to identify semantic frames.",
        "A word embedding is a distributed representation of meaning where each word is represented as a vector in R n .",
        "Such representations allow a model to share meaning between similar words, and have been used to capture semantic, syntactic and morphological content (Collobert and We-ston, 2008; Turian et al., 2010, inter alia).",
        "We use word embeddings to represent the syntactic context of a particular predicate instance as a vector.",
        "For example, consider the sentence ?He runs the company.?",
        "The predicate runs has two syntactic dependents ?",
        "a subject and direct object (but no prepositional phrases or clausal complements).",
        "We could represent the syntactic context of runs as a vector with blocks for all the possible dependents warranted by a syntactic parser; for example, we could assume that positions 0 .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "n in the vector correspond to the subject dependent, n+1 .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "2n correspond to the clausal complement dependent, and so forth.",
        "Thus, the context is a vector in R nk with the embedding of He at the subject position, the embedding of company in direct object position and zeros everywhere else.",
        "Given input vectors of this form for our training data, we learn a matrix that maps this high dimensional and sparse representation into a lower dimensional space.",
        "Si-multaneously, the model learns an embedding for all the possible labels (i.e. the frames in a given lexicon).",
        "At inference time, the predicate-context is mapped to the low dimensional space, and we choose the nearest frame label as our classification.",
        "We next describe this model in detail.",
        "3 Frame Identification with Embeddings We continue using the example sentence from ?2.2: ?He runs the company.?",
        "where we want to disambiguate the frame of runs in context.",
        "First, we extract the words in the syntactic context of runs; next, we concatenate their word embeddings as described in ?2.2 to create an initial vector space representation.",
        "Subsequently, we learn a mapping from this initial representation into a low-dimensional space; we also learn an embedding for each possible frame label in the same low-dimensional space.",
        "The goal of learning is to make sure that the correct frame label is as close as possible to the mapped context, while competing frame labels are farther away.",
        "Formally, let x represent the actual sentence with a marked predicate, along with the associated syntactic parse tree; let our initial representation of the predicate context be g(x).",
        "Suppose that the word embeddings we start with are of dimension n. Then g is a function from a parsed sentence x to R nk , where k is the number of possible syntactic context types.",
        "For example g selects some important positions relative to the predicate, and reserves a block in its output space for the embedding of words found at that position.",
        "Suppose g considers clausal complements and direct objects.",

        "The mapping M is a linear trans-formation, and we learn it using the WSABIE algorithm (Weston et al., 2011).",
        "WSABIE also learns an embedding for each frame label (y, henceforth).",
        "In our setting, this means that each frame corresponds to a point in R m .",
        "If we have F possible frames we can store those parameters in an F ?m matrix, one m-dimensional point for each frame, which we will refer to as the linear mapping Y .",
        "Let the lexical unit (the lemma conjoined with a coarse POS tag) for the marked predicate be `.",

        "WSABIE performs gradient-based updates on an objective that tries to minimize the distance between M(g(x)) and the embedding of the correct label Y (y), while maintaining a large distance between M(g(x)) and the other possible labels Y (y?)",
        "in the confusion set F ` .",
        "At disambiguation time, we use a simple dot product similarity as our distance metric, meaning that the model chooses a label by computing the argmax y s(x, y) where s(x, y) = M(g(x)) ?Y (y), where the argmax iterates over the possible frames y ?",

        "the (red) vertical embedding vectors for each word are concatenated into a long vector.",
        "Finally, we learn a linear transformation function parametrized by the context blocks (4).",
        "Weston et al. (2011), and in more detail in section 3.2.",
        "Since WSABIE learns a single mapping from g(x) to R m , parameters are shared between different words and different frames.",
        "So for example ?He runs the company?",
        "could help the model disambiguate ?He owns the company.?",
        "Moreover, since g(x) relies on word embeddings rather than word identities, information is shared between words.",
        "For example ?He runs the company?",
        "could help us to learn about ?She runs a corporation?.",
        "3.1 Context Representation Extraction In principle g(x) could be any feature function, but we performed an initial investigation of two particular variants.",
        "In both variants, our representation is a block vector where each block corresponds to a syntactic position relative to the predicate, and each block's values correspond to the embedding of the word at that position.",
        "Direct Dependents The first context function we considered corresponds to the examples in ?3.",
        "To elaborate, the positions of interest are the labels of the direct dependents of the predicate, so k is the number of labels that the dependency parser can produce.",
        "For example, if the label on the edge between runs and He is nsubj, we would put the embedding of He in the block corresponding to nsubj.",
        "If a label occurs multiple times, then the embeddings of the words below this label are averaged.",
        "Unfortunately, using only the direct dependents can miss a lot of useful information.",
        "For exam-ple, topicalization can place discriminating information farther from the predicate.",
        "Consider ?He runs the company.?",
        "vs. ?It was the company that he runs.?",
        "In the second sentence, the discriminating word, company dominates the predicate runs.",
        "Similarly, predicates in embedded clauses may have a distant agent which cannot be captured using direct dependents.",
        "Consider ?The athlete ran the marathon.?",
        "vs. ?The athlete prepared himself for three months to run the marathon.?",
        "In the second example, for the predicate run, the agent The athlete is not a direct dependent, but is connected via a longer dependency path.",
        "Dependency Paths To capture more relevant context, we developed a second context function as follows.",
        "We scanned the training data for a given task (either the PropBank or the FrameNet domains) for the dependency paths that connected the gold predicates to the gold semantic arguments.",
        "This set of dependency paths were deemed as possible positions in the initial vector space representation.",
        "In addition, akin to the first context function, we also added all dependency labels to the context set.",
        "Thus for this context function, the block cardinality k was the sum of the number of scanned gold dependency path types and the number of dependency labels.",
        "Given a predicate in its sentential context, we therefore extract only those context words that appear in positions warranted by the above set.",
        "See Figure 2 for an illustration of this process.",

        "Of the remaining 55 documents, 16 documents were randomly chosen for development.",
        "9 For experiments with PropBank, we used the Ontonotes corpus (Hovy et al., 2006), version 4.0, and only made use of the Wall Street Journal doc-uments; we used sections 2-21 for training, section 24 for development and section 23 for testing.",
        "This resembles the setup used by Punyakanok et al. (2008).",
        "All the verb frame files in Ontonotes were used for creating our frame lexicon.",

        "In order to speed up learning, we use an unnormalized output layer and a hinge-loss objective.",

        "We believe that the WSABIE EMBEDDING model performs better than the LOG-LINEAR EMBEDDING baseline (that uses the same input representation) because the former setting allows examples with different labels and confusion sets to share informa-tion; this is due to the fact that all labels live in the same label space, and a single projection matrix is shared across the examples to map the input features to this space.",
        "Consequently, the WSABIE EMBEDDING model can share more information between different examples in the training data than the LOG-LINEAR EMBEDDING model.",
        "Since the LOG-LINEAR WORDS model always performs better than the LOG-LINEAR EMBEDDING model, we conclude that the primary benefit does not come from the input embedding representation.",

        "This can be partially explained with the significantly larger training set size for PropBank, making features based on words more useful.",
        "Another important distinction between PropBank and FrameNet is that the latter shares frames between multiple lexical units.",

        "column in Table 4.",
        "WSABIE EMBEDDING performs poorly in this setting while LOG-LINEAR EMBEDDING performs well.",
        "Part of the explanation has to do with the specifics of WSABIE training.",
        "Recall that the WSABIE EMBEDDING model needs to estimate the label location in R m for each frame.",
        "In other words, it must estimate 512 parameters based on at most 10 training examples.",
        "However, since the input representation is shared across all frames, every other training example from all the lexical units affects the optimal estimate, since they all modify the joint parameter matrixM .",
        "By contrast, in the log-linear models each label has its own set of parameters, and they interact only via the normalization constant.",
        "The LOG-LINEAR WORDS model does not have this entanglement, but cannot share information between words.",

        "these drawbacks and benefits balance out and we see similar performance for LOG-LINEAR WORDS and LOG-LINEAR EMBEDDING.",
        "For FrameNet, estimating the label embedding is not as much of a problem because even if a lexical unit is rare, the potential frames can be frequent.",
        "For example, we might have seen the SENDING frame many times, even though telex.V is a rare lexical unit.",
        "In comparison to prior work on FrameNet, even our baseline models outperform the previous state of the art.",
        "A particularly interesting comparison is between our LOG-LINEAR WORDS baseline and the supervised model of Das et al. (2014).",
        "They also use a log-linear model, but they incorporate a latent variable that uses WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) to get lexical-semantic relationships and smooths over frames for ambiguous lexical units.",
        "It is possible that this reduces the model's power and causes it to over-generalize.",
        "Another difference is that when training the log-linear model, they normalize over all frames, while we normalize over the allowed frames for the current lexical unit.",
        "This would tend to encourage their model to expend more of its modeling power to rule out possibilities that will be pruned out at test time.",
        "7 Conclusion We have presented a simple model that outperforms the prior state of the art on FrameNet-style frame-semantic parsing, and performs at par with one of the previous-best single-parser systems on PropBank SRL.",
        "Unlike Das et al. (2014), our model does not rely on heuristics to construct a similarity graph and leverage WordNet; hence, in principle it is generalizable to varying domains, and to other languages.",
        "Finally, we presented results on PropBank-style semantic role labeling with a system that included the task of automatic verb frame identification, in tune with the FrameNet literature; we believe that such a system produces more interpretable output, both from the perspective of human understanding as well as downstream applications, than pipelines that are oblivious to the verb frame, only focusing on argument analysis.",
