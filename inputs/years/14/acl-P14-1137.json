        "One of very common phenomena in language is that a plenty of words have multiple meanings.",
        "In the context of machine translation, such different meanings normally produce different target translations.",
        "Therefore a natural assumption is that word sense disambiguation (WSD) may contribute to statistical machine translation (SMT) by providing appropriate word senses for target translation selection with context features (Carpuat and Wu, 2005).",
        "?",
        "Corresponding author This assumption, however, has not been empirically verified in the early days.",
        "Carpuat and Wu (2005) adopt a standard formulation of WSD: predicting word senses that are defined on an ontology for ambiguous words.",
        "As they apply WSD to Chinese-to-English translation, they predict word senses from a Chinese ontology HowNet and project the predicted senses to English glosses provided by HowNet.",
        "These glosses, used as the sense predictions of their WSD system, are integrated into a word-based SMT system either to substitute for translation candidates of their translation model or to postedit the output of their SMT system.",
        "They report that WSD degenerates the translation quality of SMT.",
        "In contrast to the standard WSD formulation, Vickrey et al. (2005) reformulate the task of WSD for SMT as predicting possible target translations rather than senses for ambiguous source words.",
        "They show that such a reformulated WSD can improve the accuracy of a simplified word translation task.",
        "Following this WSD reformulation for SMT, Chan et al. (2007) integrate a state-of-the-art WSD system into a hierarchical phrase-based system (Chiang, 2005).",
        "Carpuat and Wu (2007) also use this reformulated WSD and further adapt it to multi-word phrasal disambiguation.",
        "They both report that the redefined WSD can significantly improve SMT.",
        "Although this reformulated WSD has proved helpful for SMT, one question is not answered yet: are pure word senses useful for SMT?",
        "The early WSD for SMT (Carpuat and Wu, 2005) uses projected word senses while the reformulated WSD sidesteps word senses.",
        "In this paper we would like to re-investigate this question by resorting to word sense induction (WSI) that is related to but different from WSD.",
        "1 We use 1 We will discuss the relation and difference between WSI and WSD in Section 2.",
        "1459 WSI to obtain word senses for large-scale data.",
        "With these word senses, we study in particular: 1) whether word senses can be directly integrated to SMT to improve translation quality and 2) whether WSI-based model can outperform the reformulated WSD in the context of SMT.",
        "In order to incorporate word senses into SMT, we propose a sense-based translation model that is built on maximum entropy classifiers.",
        "We use a nonparametric Bayesian topic model basedWSI to infer word senses for source words in our training, development and test set.",

        "Instead of predicting target translations for ambiguous source words as the previous reformulated WSD does, we first predict word senses for ambiguous source words.",
        "The predicted word senses together with other context features are then used to predict possible target translations for these words.",
        "?",

        "Results show that automatically learned word senses are able to improve translation quality and the sense-based translation model is better than the previous reformulated WSD.",
        "The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows.",

        "Section 3 presents our sense-based translation model.",
        "Section 4 describes how we integrate the sense-based translation model into SMT.",
        "Section 5 elaborates our experiments on the large-scale Chinese-to-English translation task.",
        "Section 6 introduces related studies and highlights significant differences from them.",
        "Finally, we conclude in Section 7 with future directions.",
        "2 WSI-Based Broad-Coverage Sense Tagger In order to obtain word senses for any source words, we build a broad-coverage sense tagger that relies on the nonparametric Bayesian model based word sense induction.",
        "We first describe WSI, especially WSI based on the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) (Teh et al., 2004), a nonparametric version of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "We then elaborate how we use the HDP-based WSI to predict sense clusters and to annotate source words in our train-ing/development/test sets with these sense clusters.",
        "2.1 Word Sense Induction Before we introduce WSI, we differentiate word type from word token.",
        "A word type refers to a unique word as a vocabulary entry while a word token is an occurrence of a word type.",
        "Take the first sentence of this paragraph as an example, it has 11 word tokens but 9 word types as there are two word tokens of the word type ?we?",
        "and two tokens of the word type ?word?.",
        "Word sense induction is a task of automatically inducing the underlying senses of word tokens given the surrounding contexts where the word tokens occur.",
        "The biggest difference from word sense disambiguation lies in that WSI does not rely on a predefined sense inventory.",
        "Such a prespecified list of senses is normally assumed by WSD which predicts senses of word tokens using this given inventory.",
        "From this perspective, WSI can be treated as a clustering problem while WSD a classification one.",
        "Various clustering algorithms, such as k-means, have been previously used for WSI.",
        "Recently, we have also witnessed that WSI is cast as a topic modeling problem where the sense clusters of a word type are considered as underlying topics (Brody and Lapata, 2009; Yao and Durme, 2011; Lau et al., 2012).",
        "We follow this line to tailor a topic modeling framework to induce word senses for our large-scale training data.",
        "In the topic-based WSI, surrounding context of a word token is considered as a pseudo document of the corresponding word type.",
        "A pseudo document is composed of either a bag of neighboring words of a word token, or the Part-to-Speech tags of neighboring words, or other contextual information elements.",
        "In this paper, we define a pseudo 1460 document as ?N neighboring words centered on a given word token.",
        "Table 1 shows examples of pseudo documents for a Chinese word ?w?nglu??",

        "These two pseudo documents are extracted from a sentence listed in the first row of Table 1.",
        "Here we set N = 5.",
        "We can extract as many pseudo documents as the number of word tokens of a given word type that occur in training data.",
        "The collection of all these extracted pseudo documents of the given word type forms a corpus.",
        "We can induce topics on this corpus for each pseudo document via topic modeling approaches.",
        "Figure 1(a) shows the LDA-based WSI for a given word type W .",

        "Therefore we resort to the HDP, a natural nonparametric generalization of LDA, for the inference of both sense clusters and the number of sense clusters following Lau et al. (2012) and Yao and Durme (2011).",

        "We want to extend this hypothesis to machine translation by building sense-based translation model upon the HDP-based word sense in-duction: words with the same meanings tend to be translated in the same way.",

        "We extract both the lexicon and sense features from a ?k-word window centered on the word c. The lexicon features are defined as the preceding k words, the succeeding k words and the word c itself: {c ?k , ..., c ?1 , c, c 1 , ..., c k }.",
        "The sense features are defined as the predicted senses for these words: {s c ?k , ..., s c ?1 , s c , s c 1 , ..., s c k }.",
        "As we also use these neighboring words to predict word senses in the HDP-based WSI, the information provided by the lexicon and sense features may overlap.",

        "Therefore we take the second strategy: building multiple MaxEnt classifiers with one classifier per source word type.",
        "In order to train these classifiers, we have to collect training events from our word-aligned bilingual training data where source words are annotated with their corresponding sense clusters predicted by the HDP-based WSI as described in Section 2.",
