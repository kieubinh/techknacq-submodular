        "1.1 Chinese Input Method The daily life of Chinese people heavily depends on Chinese input method engine (IME), no matter whether one is composing an E-mail, writing an article, or sending a text message.",
        "However, every Chinese word inputted into computer or cellphone cannot be typed through one-to-one mapping of key-to-letter inputting directly, but has to go through an IME as there are thousands of Chinese characters for inputting while only 26 letter keys are available in the keyboard.",
        "An IME is an essential software interface that maps Chinese characters into English letter combinations.",
        "An ef-?This work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.60903119, Grant No.61170114, and Grant No.61272248), the National Basic Research Program of China (Grant No.2013CB329401), the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (Grant No.13511500200), and the European Union Seventh Framework Program (Grant No.247619).",
        "?Corresponding author ficient IME will largely improve the user experience of Chinese information processing.",
        "Nowadays most of Chinese IMEs are pinyin based.",
        "Pinyin is originally designed as the phonetic symbol of a Chinese character (based on the standard modern Chinese, mandarin) , using Latin letters as its syllable notation.",
        "For example, the pinyin of the Chinese character ???",
        "(love) is ??i?.",
        "Most characters usually have unique pinyin rep-resentations, while a few Chinese characters may be pronounced in several different ways, so they may have multiple pinyin representations.",
        "The advantage of pinyin IME is that it only adopts the pronunciation perspective of Chinese characters so that it is simple and easy to learn.",
        "But there are only less than 500 pinyin syllables in standard modern Chinese, compared with over 6,000 commonly used Chinese characters, which leads to serious ambiguities for pinyin-to-charactermap-ping.",
        "Modern pinyin IMEsmostly use a ?sentence- based?",
        "decoding technique (Chen and Lee, 2000) to alleviate the ambiguities.",
        "?Sentence based?",
        "means that IME generates a sequence of Chinese characters upon a sequence of pinyin inputs with respect to certain statistical criteria.",
        "1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking Written in Chinese characters but not alphabets, spell checking for Chinese language is quite different from the same task for other languages.",
        "Since Chinese characters are entered via IME, those user-made typos do not immediately lead to spelling errors.",
        "When a user types a wrong letter, IME will be very likely to fail to generate the expected Chinese character sequence.",
        "Normally, the user may immediately notice the inputting error and then make corrections, which usually means doing a bunch of extra operations like cursor 1512 movement, deletion and re-typing.",
        "Thus there are two separated sub-tasks for Chinese spell check-ing: 1. typo checking for user typed pinyin sequences which should be a built-in module in IME, and 2. spell checking for Chinese texts in its narrow sense, which is typically a module of word processing applications (Yang et al., 2012b).",
        "These two terms are often confused especially in IME related works such as (Chen and Lee, 2000) and (Wu et al., 2009).",
        "Pinyin typos have always been a serious problem for Chinese pinyin IMEs.",
        "The user may fail to input the completely right pinyin simply because he/she is a dialect speaker and does not know the exact pronunciation for the expected character.",
        "This may be a very common situation since there are about seven quite different dialects in Chinese, among which being spoken languages, six are far different from the standard modern Chinese, mandarin.",
        "With the boom of smart-phones, pinyin typos worsen due to the limited size of soft key-board, and the lack of physical feedback on the touch screen.",
        "However, existing practical IMEs only provide small patches to deal with typos such as Fuzzy Pinyin (Wu and Chen, 2004) and other language specific errors (Zheng et al., 2011b).",
        "Typo checking and correction has an important impact on IME performance.",
        "When IME fails to correct a typo and generate the expected sentence, the user will have to takemuch extra effort to move the cursor back to the mistyped letter and correct it, which leads to very poor user experience (Jia and Zhao, 2013).",
        "2 Related Works The very first approach for Chinese input with typo correction was made by (Chen and Lee, 2000), which was also the initial attempt of ?sentence-based?",
        "IME.",
        "The idea of ?statistical input method?",
        "was proposed by modeling PTC conversion as a hidden Markov model (HMM), and using Viterbi (Viterbi, 1967) algorithm to decode the sequence.",
        "They solved the typo correction problem by decomposing the conditional probability P (H|P ) of Chinese character sequence H given pinyin sequence P into a language model P (w i |w i?1 ) and a typing model P (p i |w i ).",
        "The typing model that was estimated on real user input data was for typo correction.",
        "However, real user input data can be very noisy and not very convenient to obtain.",
        "As we will propose a joint model in this paper, such an individual typing model is not necessarily built in our approach.",
        "(Zheng et al., 2011a) developed an IME system with typo correction called CHIME using noisy channel error model and language-specific features.",
        "However their model depended on a very strong assumption that input pinyin sequence should have been segmented into pinyin words by the user.",
        "This assumption does not really hold in modern ?sentence-based?",
        "IMEs.",
        "We release this assumption since our model solves segmentation, typo correction and PTC conversion jointly.",
        "Besides the common HMM approach for PTC conversion, there are also variousmethods such as: support vector machine (Jiang et al., 2007), maximum entropy (ME) model (Wang et al., 2006), conditional random field (CRF) (Li et al., 2009) and statistical machine translation (SMT) (Yang et al., 2012a; Wang et al., 2013c; Zhang and Zhao, 2013), etc.",
        "Spell checking or typo checking was first proposed for English (Peterson, 1980).",
        "(Mays et al., 1991) addressed that spell checking should be done within a context, i.e., a sentence or a long phrase with a certain meaning, instead of only in one word.",
        "A recent spell correction work is (Li et al., 2006), where a distributional similarity was introduced for spell correction of web queries.",
        "Early attempts for Chinese spelling checking could date back to (Chang, 1994) where character tables for similar shape, pronunciation, mean-ing, and input-method-code characters were proposed.",
        "More recently, the 7th SIGHANWorkshop on Chinese Language Processing (Yu et al., 2013) held a shared task on Chinese spell checking.",
        "Various approaches were made for the task including language model (LM) based methods (Chen et al., 2013), ME model (Han and Chang, 2013), CRF (Wang et al., 2013d; Wang et al., 2013a), SMT (Chiu et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013), and graph model (Jia et al., 2013), etc.",
        "3 Pinyin Input Method Model 3.1 From English Letter to Chinese Sentence It is a rather long journey from the first English letter typed on the keyboard to finally a completed Chinese sentence generated by IME.",
        "We will first take an overview of the entire process.",
        "The average length of pinyin syllables is about 3 letters.",
        "There are about 410 pinyin syllables used in the current pinyin system.",
        "Each pinyin sylla-1513 ble has a bunch of corresponding Chinese characters which share the same pronunciation represented by the syllable.",
        "The number of those homophones ranges from 1 to over 300.",
        "Chinese characters then form words.",
        "But word in Chinese is a rather vague concept.",
        "Without word delimiters, linguists have argued on what a Chinese word really is for a long time and that is why there is always a primary word segmentation treatment in most Chinese language processing tasks (Zhao et al., 2006; Huang and Zhao, 2007; Zhao and Kit, 2008; Zhao et al., 2010; Zhao and Kit, 2011; Zhao et al., 2013).",
        "A Chinese word may contain from 1 to over 10 characters due to different word segmentation conventions.",
        "Figure 1 demonstrates the relationship of pinyin andword, from pinyin letters ?nihao?",
        "to the word ???",
        "(hello)?.",
        "Typically, an IME takes the pinyin input, segments it into sylla-bles, looks up corresponding words in a dictionary and generates a sentence with the candidate words.",

        "instead of segmented pinyin sequence ?ni hao shi jie?.",
        "Nev-ertheless, pinyin syllable segmentation is a much easier problem compared to Chinese word segmentation.",
        "Since pinyin syllables have a very limited vocabulary and follow a set of regularities strictly, it is convenient to perform pinyin syllable segmentation by using rules.",
        "But as the pinyin input is not segmented, it is nearly impossible to adopt previous spell checking methods for English to pinyin typo checking, although techniques for English spell checking have been well developed.",
        "A bit confusing but interesting, pinyin typo correction and segmentation come as two sides of one problem: when a pinyin sequence is mistyped, it is unlikely to be correctly segmented; when it is segmented in an awkward way, it is likely to be mistyped.",
        "Inspired by (Yang et al., 2012b) and (Jia et al., 2013), we adopt the graph model for Chinese spell checking for pinyin segmentation and typo correc-tion, which is based on the shortest path word segmentation algorithm (Casey and Lecolinet, 1996).",
