        "Computational psycholinguists build such models to aid in their study of human language processing.",
        "Errors in NLP are measured with tools like precision and recall, while errors in psycholinguistics are defined as failures to model a target phenomenon.",
        "In the current study, we exploit errors of the latter variety?failure of a language model to predict human performance?to investigate bias across several frequently used corpora in computational linguistics.",
        "The human data is revealing because it trades on the fact that human language processing is probability-sensitive: language processing reflects implicit knowledge of probabilities computed over linguistic units (e.g., words).",
        "For ex-ample, the amount of time required to read a word varies as a function of how predictable that word is (McDonald and Shillcock, 2003).",
        "Thus, failure of a language model to predict human performance reveals a mismatch between the language model and the human language model, i.e., bias.",
        "Psycholinguists have known for some time that the ability of a corpus to explain behavior depends on properties of the corpus and the subjects (cf. Balota et al. (2004)).",
        "We extend that line of work by directly analyzing and quantifying this bias, and by linking the results to methodological concerns in both NLP and psycholinguistics.",
        "Specifically, we predict human data from three widely used psycholinguistic experimental paradigms?lexical decision, word naming, and picture naming?using unigram frequency estimates from Google n-grams (Brants and Franz, 2006), Switchboard (Godfrey et al., 1992), spoken and written English portions of CELEX (Baayen et al., 1995), and spoken and written portions of the British National Corpus (BNC Consor-tium, 2007).",
        "While we find comparable overall fits of the behavioral data from all corpora under consideration, our analyses also reveal specific domain biases.",
        "For example, Google n-grams overestimates the ease with which humans will process words related to the web (tech, code, search, site), while the Switchboard corpus?a collection of informal telephone conversations between strangers?overestimates how quickly humans will react to colloquialisms (heck, darn) and backchannels (wow, right).",

        "Significant correlations were found between log frequency estimates for all pairs (Fig- ure 1).",
        "Intuitive biases are apparent in the corre-lations, e.g.: BNCw correlates heavily with BNCs (0.91), but less with SWBD (0.79), while BNCs correlates more with SWBD (0.84).",

        "decision (time required by subjects to correctly identify a string of letters as a word of English (Balota et al., 1999)); word naming (time required to read aloud a visually presented word (Spieler and Balota, 1997); (Balota and Spieler, 1998)); and picture naming (time required to say a pic-ture's name (Bates et al., 2003)).",
        "Previous work has shown that more frequent words lead to faster RTs.",
        "These three measures provide a strong test for the biases present in these corpora, as they span written and spoken lexical comprehension and production.",
        "To compare the predictive strength of log frequency estimates from each corpus, we fit mixed effects regression models to the data from each experiment.",
        "As controls, all models included (1) mean log bigram frequency for each word, (2) word category (noun, verb, etc.",
        "), (3) log morphological family size (number of inflectional and derivational morphological family members), (4) number of synonyms, and (5) the first principal component of a host of orthographic and phonological features capturing neighborhood effects (type and token counts of orthographic and phonological neighbors as well as forward and backward inconsistent words; (Baayen et al., 2006)).",
        "Models of lexical decision and word naming included random intercepts of participant age to adjust for differences in mean RTs between old (mean age = 72) vs. young (mean age = 23) subjects, given differences between younger vs. older adults?",
        "processing speed (cf. (Ramscar et al., 2014)).",

        "2 value resulting from the log-likelihood ratio of (1) a model containing A and an estimate from one of the five remaining corpora (given on the x axis) and (2) a model containing just the corpus indicated on the x axis.",
        "Thus, for each panel, each bar in Figure 2 shows the explanatory power of estimates from the corpus given at the top of the panel after controlling for estimates from each of the other corpora.",
        "Model fits reveal intuitive, previously undocumented biases in the ability of each corpus to predict human data.",
        "For example, corpora of British English tend to explain relatively little after con-8 trolling for other British corpora in modeling lexical decision RTs (yellow).",
        "Similarly, Switchboard provides relatively little explanatory power over the other corpora in predicting picture naming RTs (blue bars), possibly because highly image-able nouns and verbs frequent in everyday interactions are underrepresented in telephone conversations between people with no common visual experience.",
        "In other words, idiosyncratic facts about the topics, dialects, etc.",
        "represented in each corpus lead to systematic patterns in how well each corpus can predict human data relative to the others.",
        "In some cases, the predictive value of one corpus after controlling for another?apparently for reasons related to genre, dialect?can be quite large (cf. the ?",
        "2 difference between a model with both Google and Switchboard frequency estimates compared to one with only Switchboard [top right yellow bar]).",
        "In addition to comparing the overall predictive power of the corpora, we examined the words for which behavioral predictions derived from the corpora deviated most from the observed behavior (word frequencies strongly over-or underestimated by each corpora).",
        "First, in Table 2 we give the ten words with the greatest relative difference in frequency for each corpus pair.",
        "For exam-ple, fife is deemed more frequent according to the BNC than to Google.",
        "2 These results suggest that particular corpora may be genre-biased in systematic ways.",
        "For in-stance, Google appears to be biased towards terminology dealing with adult material and technology.",
        "Similarly, BNCw is biased, relative to Google, towards Britishisms.",
        "For these words in the BNC and Google, we examined errors in predicted lexical decision times.",
        "Figure 3 plots errors in the linear model's prediction of RTs for older (top) and younger (bottom) subjects.",
        "The figure shows a positive correlation between how large the difference is between the lexical decision RT predicted by the model and the actually observed RT, and how over-estimated the log frequency of that word is in the BNC relative to Google (left panel) or in Google relative to the BNC (right panel).",
        "The left panel shows that BNC produces a much greater estimate of the log fre-2 Surprisingly, fife was determined to be one of the words with the largest frequency asymmetry between Switchboard and the Google n-grams corpus.",
        "This was a result of lower-casing all of the words in in the analyses, and the fact that Barney Fife was mentioned several times in the BNC.",
        "quency of the word lee relative to Google, which leads the model to predict a lower RT for this word than is observed (i.e., the error is positive; though note that the error is less severe for older relative to younger subjects).",
        "By contrast, the asymmetry between the two corpora in the estimated frequency of sir is less severe, so the observed RT deviates less from the predicted RT.",
        "In the right panel, we see that Google assigns a much greater estimate of log frequency to the word tech than the BNC, which leads a model predicting RTs from Google-derived frequency estimates to predict a far lower RT for this word than observed.",
        "3 Discussion Researchers in computational linguistics often assume that more data is always better than less data (Banko and Brill, 2001).",
        "This is true insofar as larger corpora allow computational linguists to generate less noisy estimates of the average language experience of the users of computational linguistics applications.",
        "However, corpus size does not necessarily eliminate certain types of biases in estimates of human linguistic experience, as demonstrated in Figure 3.",
        "Our analyses reveal that 6 commonly used corpora fail to reflect the human language model in various ways related to dialect, modality, and other properties of each corpus.",
        "Our results point to a type of bias in commonly used language models that has been previously overlooked.",
        "This bias may limit the effectiveness of NLP algorithms intended to generalize to a linguistic domains whose statistical properties are generated by humans.",
        "For psycholinguists these results support an important methodological point: while each corpus presents systematic biases in how well it predicts human behavior, all six corpora are, on the whole, of comparable predictive value and, specifically, the results suggest that the web performs as well as traditional instruments in predicting behavior.",
        "This has two implications for psycholinguistic research.",
        "First, as argued by researchers such as Lew (2009), given the size of the Web compared to other corpora, research focusing on low-frequency linguistic events?or requiring knowledge of the distributional characteristics of varied contexts?",
        "is now more tractable.",
        "Second, the viability of the web in predicting behavior opens up possibilities for computational psycholinguistic research in languages for which no corpora exist (i.e., most 9 CELEX written BNC written Google CELEX spoken BNC spoken Switchboard 0 40 80 120 0 10 20 30 40 0 10 20 30 0 10 20 30 0 10 20 30 40 0 5 10 CE LEX wr itte n BN C w ritte n Go ogle CE LEX sp oke n BN C s pok en Sw itch boa rd CE LEX wr itte n BN C w ritte n Go ogle CE LEX sp oke n BN C s pok en Sw itch boa rd CE LEX wr itte n BN C w ritte n Go ogle CE LEX sp oke n BN C s pok en Sw itch boa rd Comparison ?",
