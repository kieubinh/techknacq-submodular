        "In situated human-robot dialogue, humans and robots have mismatched capabilities of perceiving the shared environment.",
        "Thus referential communication between them becomes extremely challenging.",
        "To address this problem, our previous work has conducted a simulation-based study to collect a set of human-human conversation data that explain how partners with mismatched perceptions strive to succeed in referential communication (Liu et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013).",
        "Our data have shown that, when conversation partners have mismatched perceptions, they tend to make extra collaborative effort in referential communication.",
        "For example, the speaker often refers to the intended object iteratively: first issuing an initial installment, and then refashioning till the hearer identifies the referent correctly.",
        "The hearer, on the other hand, often provides useful feedback based on which further refashioning can be made.",
        "This data has demonstrated the importance of incorporating collaborative discourse for referential grounding.",
        "Based on this data, as a first step we developed a graph-matching approach for referential grounding (Liu et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013).",
        "This approach uses Attributed Relational Graph to capture collaborative discourse and employs a state-space search algorithm to find proper grounding results.",
        "Although it has made meaningful progress in addressing collaborative referential grounding under mismatched perceptions, the state-space search based approach has two major limitations.",
        "First, it is neither flexible to obtain multiple grounding hypotheses, nor flexible to incorporate different hypotheses incrementally for follow-up grounding.",
        "Second, the search algorithm tends to have a high time complexity for optimal solutions.",
        "Thus, the previous approach is not ideal for collaborative and incremental dialogue systems that interact with human users in real time.",
        "To address these limitations, this paper describes a new approach to referential grounding based on probabilistic labeling.",
        "This approach aims to integrate different types of evidence from the collaborative referential discourse into a unified probabilistic scheme.",
        "It is formulated under the Bayesian reasoning framework to easily support generation and incorporation of multiple grounding hypotheses for follow-up processes.",
        "Our empirical results have shown that the probabilistic labeling approach significantly outperforms the state-space search approach in both grounding accuracy and efficiency.",
        "This new approach provides a good basis for processing collaborative discourse and enabling collaborative dialogue system in situated referential communication.",
        "13 2 Related Work Previous works on situated referential grounding have mainly focused on computational models that connect linguistic referring expressions to the perceived environment (Gorniak and Roy, 2004; Gorniak and Roy, 2007; Siebert and Schlangen, 2008; Matuszek et al., 2012; Jayant and Thomas, 2013).",
        "These works have provided valuable insights on how to manually and/or automatically build key components (e.g., semantic parsing, grounding functions between visual features and words, mapping procedures) for a situated referential grounding system.",
        "However, most of these works only dealt with the interpretation of single referring ex-pressions, rather than interrelated expressions in collaborative dialogue.",
        "Some earlier work (Edmonds, 1994; Heeman and Hirst, 1995) proposed a symbolic reasoning (i.e. planning) based approach to incorporate collaborative dialogue.",
        "However, in situated settings pure symbolic approaches will not be sufficient and new approaches that are robust to uncertainties need to be pursued.",
        "DeVault and Stone (2009) proposed a hybrid approach which combined symbolic reasoning and machine learning for interpreting referential grounding dialogue.",
        "But their ?environment?",
        "was a simplistic block world and the issue of mismatched perceptions was not addressed.",
        "3 Data Previously, we have collected a set of human-human dialogues on an object-naming task (Liu et al., 2012).",
        "To simulate mismatched perceptions between a human and an artificial agent, two participants were shown different versions of an im-age: the director was shown the original image containing some randomly placed objects (e.g., fruits), and the matcher was shown an impoverished version of the image generated by computer vision.",
        "They were instructed to communicate with each other to figure out the identities of some ?named?",
        "objects (only known to the direc-tor), such that the matcher could also know which object has what name.",
        "Here is an example excerpt from this dataset: D 1 : there is basically a cluster of four objects in the upper left, do you see that (1) M: yes (2) D: ok, so the one in the corner is a blue cup (3) 1 D stands for the director; M stands for the matcher.",
        "M: I see there is a square, but fine, it is blue (4) D: alright, I will just go with that, so and then right under that is a yellow pepper (5) M: ok, I see apple but orangish yellow (6) D: ok, so that yellow pepper is named Brittany (7) M: uh, the bottom left of those four?",
        "Because I do see a yellow pepper in the upper right (8) D: the upper right of the four of them?",
        "(9) M: yes (10) D: ok, so that is basically the one to the right of the blue cup (11) M: yeah (12) D: that is actually an apple (13) As we can see from this example, both the director and the matcher make extra efforts to overcome the mismatched perceptions through collaborative dialogue.",
        "Our ultimate goal is to develop computational approaches that can ground interrelated referring expressions to the physical world, and enable collaborative actions of the dialogue agent (similar to the active role that the matcher played in the human-human dialogue).",
        "For the time be-ing, we use this data to evaluate our computational approach for referential grounding, namely, replacing the matcher by our automatic system to ground the director's referring expressions.",
        "4 Probabilistic Labeling for Reference Grounding 4.1 System Overview Our system first processes the data using automatic semantic parsing and coreference resolution.",
        "For semantic parsing, we use a rule-based CCG parser (Bozsahin et al., 2005) to parse each utterance into a formal semantic representation.",
        "For example, the utterance ?a pear is to the right of the apple?",
        "is parsed as [a 1 , a 2 ] , [Pear(a 1 ), Apple(a 2 ), RightOf(a 1 , a 2 )] which consists of a list of discourse entities (e.g., a 1 and a 2 ) and a list of first-order-logic predicates that specify the unary attributes of these entities and the binary relations between them.",
        "We then perform pairwise coreference resolution on the discourse entities to find out the discourse relations between entities from different utterances.",
        "Formally, let a i be a discourse entity extracted from the current utterance, and a j a discourse entity from a previous utterance.",
        "We train a maximum entropy classifier 2 (Manning and Klein, 2 The features we use for the classification include the distance between a i and a j , the determiners associated with them, the associated pronouns, the syntactic roles, the extracted unary properties, etc.",
        "14 2003) to predict whether a i and a j should refer to the same object (i.e. positive) or to different objects (i.e. negative).",
        "Based on the semantic parsing and pairwise coreference resolution results, our system further builds a graph representation to capture the collaborative discourse and formulate referential grounding as a probabilistic labeling problem, as described next.",
        "4.2 Graph Representation We use an Attributed Relational Graph (Tsai and Fu, 1979) to represent the referential grounding discourse (which we call the ?dialogue graph?).",
        "It is constructed based on the semantic parsing and coreference resolution results.",
        "The dialogue graph contains a set A of N nodes: A = {a 1 , a 2 , .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", a N } in which each node a i represents a discourse entity from the parsing results.",
        "And for each pair of nodes a i and a j there can be an edge a i a j that represents the physical or discourse relation (i.e. coreference) between the two nodes.",
        "Furthermore, each node a i can be assigned a set of ?attributes?",
        ": x i = { x (1) i , x (2) i , .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", x (K) i } which are used to specify information about the unary properties of the corresponding discourse entity.",
        "Similarly, each edge a i a j can also be assigned a set of attributes x ij to specify information about the binary relations between two discourse entities.",
        "The node attributes are from the semantic parsing results, i.e., the unary properties associated to a discourse entity.",
        "The edge attributes can be either from parsing results, such as a spatial relation between two entities (e.g., RightOf(a 1 , a 2 )); Or from pairwise coreference resolution results, i.e., two entities are coreferen-tial (coref = +) or not (coref = ?).",
        "Besides the dialogue graph that represents the linguistic discourse, we build another graph to represent the perceived environment.",
        "This graph is called the ?vision graph?",
        "(since this graph is built based on computer vision's outputs).",

        "?",
        "), node attributes (e.g., ?",
        "x ? )",
        "and edge attributes (e.g., ?",
        "x ??",
        ").",
        "Note that the attributes in the vision graph mostly have numeric values extracted by computer vision algorithms, whereas the attributes in the dialogue graph have symbolic values extracted from the linguistic discourse.",
        "A set of ?symbol grounding functions?",
        "are used to bridge between the heterogeneous attributes (described later).",
