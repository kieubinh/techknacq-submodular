        "Human communications in real world situations interlace multiple topics which are related to each other in conversational contexts.",
        "This fact suggests that a dialog system should be also capable of conducting multi-topic conversations with users to provide them a more natural interaction with the system.",
        "However, the majority of previous work on dialog interfaces has focused on dealing with only a single target task.",
        "Although some multi-task dialog systems have been proposed (Lin et al., 1999; Ikeda et al., 2008; Celikyilmaz et al., 2011), they have aimed at just choosing the most probable one for each input from the sub-systems, each of which is independently operated from others.",
        "To analyze and maintain dialog topics from a more systematic perspective in a given dialog flow, some researchers (Nakata et al., 2002; Lagus and Kuusisto, 2002; Adams and Martell, 2008) have considered this dialog topic identification as a separate sub-problem of dialog management and attempted to solve it with text categorization approaches for the recognized utterances in a given turn.",
        "The major obstacle to the success of these approaches results from the differences between written texts and spoken utterances.",
        "In most text categorization tasks, the proper category for each textual unit can be assigned based only on its own content.",
        "However, the dialog topic at each turn can be determined not only by the user's intentions captured from the given utterances, but also by the system's decisions for dialog management purposes.",
        "Thus, the text categorization approaches can only be effective for the user-initiative cases when users tend to mention the topic-related expressions explicitly in their utterances.",
        "The other direction of dialog topic tracking approaches made use of external knowledge sources including domain models (Roy and Subramaniam, 2006), heuristics (Young et al., 2007), and agendas (Bohus and Rudnicky, 2003; Lee et al., 2008).",
        "These knowledge-based methods have an advantage of dealing with system-initiative dialogs, because dialog flows can be controlled by the system based on given resources.",
        "However, this aspect can limit the flexibility to handle the user's responses which are contradictory to the system's suggestions.",
        "Moreover, these approaches face cost problems for building a sufficient amount of resources to cover broad states of complex dialogs, because these resources should be manually prepared by human experts for each specific domain.",
        "In this paper, we propose a composite kernel to explore various types of information obtained from Wikipedia for mixed-initiative dialog topic tracking without significant costs for building resources.",
        "Composite kernels have been successfully applied to improve the performances in other NLP problems (Zhao and Grishman, 2005; Zhang et al., 2006) by integrating multiple individual ker-nels, which aim to overcome the errors occurring at one level by information from other levels.",
        "Our composite kernel consists of a history sequence and a domain context tree kernels, both of which are composed based on similar textual units in Wikipedia articles to a given dialog context.",

        "The most probable pair of topics at just before and after each turn is predicted by the following classifier: f(x t ) = (y t?1 , y t ), where x t contains the input features obtained at a turn t, y t ?",
        "C , and C is a closed set of topic categories.",
        "If a topic transition occurs at t, y t should be different from y t?1 .",
        "Oth-erwise, both y t and y t?1 have the same value.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of dialog topic tracking in a given dialog fragment on Singapore tour guide domain between a tourist and a guide.",
        "This conversation is divided into three segments, since f detects three topic transitions at t 1 , t 4 and t 6 .",
        "Then, a topic sequence of ?Attraction?, ?Trans- portation?, and ?Food?",
        "is obtained from the results.",
        "3 Wikipedia-based Composite Kernel for Dialog Topic Tracking The classifier f can be built on the training examples annotated with topic labels using supervised machine learning techniques.",
        "Although some fundamental features extracted from the utterances mentioned at a given turn or in a certain number of previous turns can be used for training the model, this information obtained solely from an ongoing dialog is not sufficient to identify not only user-initiative, but also system-initiative topic transitions.",
        "To overcome this limitation, we propose to leverage on Wikipedia as an external knowledge source that can be obtained without significant effort toward building resources for topic tracking.",
        "Recently, some researchers (Wilcock, 2012; Breuing et al., 2011) have shown the feasibility of using Wikipedia knowledge to build dialog systems.",
        "While each of these studies mainly focuses only on a single type of information including category relatedness or hyperlink connectedness, this work aims at incorporating various knowledge obtained from Wikipedia into the model using a composite kernel method.",
        "Our composite kernel consists of two different kernels: a history sequence kernel and a domain context tree kernel.",
        "Both represent the current dialog context at a given turn with a set of relevant Wikipedia paragraphs which are selected based on the cosine similarity between the term vectors of the recently mentioned utterances and each paragraph in the Wikipedia collection as follows: sim (x, p i ) = ?",
        "(x) ?",

        "is a decay factor for giving more importance to more recent turns, |W | is the size of word dictionary, and h is the number of previous turns considered as dialog history features.",
        "After computing this relatedness between the current dialog context and every paragraph in the Wikipedia collection, two kernel structures are constructed using the information obtained from the highly-ranked paragraphs in the Wikipedia.",
        "3.1 History Sequence Kernel The first structure to be constructed for our composite kernel is a sequence of the most similar paragraph IDs of each turn from the beginning of the session to the current turn.",

        "20 Since our hypothesis is that the more similar the dialog histories of the two inputs are, the more similar aspects of topic transtions occur for them, we propose a sub-sequence kernel (Lodhi et al., 2002) to map the data into a new feature space defined based on the similarity of each pair of history sequences as follows: K s (S 1 , S 2 ) = ?",

        "Each subtree consists of a set of features from a given paragraph in the Wikipedia collection in a hierarchical structure.",
        "Figure 3 shows an example of a constructed tree.",
        "Since this constructed tree structure represents semantic, discourse, and structural information extracted from the similar Wikipedia paragraphs to each given instance, we can explore these more enriched features to build the topic tracking model using a subset tree kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2002) which computes the similarity between each pair of trees in the feature space as follows: K t (T 1 , T 2 ) = ?",
