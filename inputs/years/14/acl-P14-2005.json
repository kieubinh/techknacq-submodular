        "Coreference resolution aims at identifying natural language expressions (or mentions) that refer to the same entity.",
        "It entails partitioning (often imperfect) mentions into equivalence classes.",
        "A critically important problem is how to measure the quality of a coreference resolution system.",
        "Many evaluation metrics have been proposed in the past two decades, including the MUC measure (Vilain et al., 1995), B-cubed (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998), CEAF (Luo, 2005) and, more recently, BLANC-gold (Recasens and Hovy, 2011).",
        "B-cubed and CEAF treat entities as sets of mentions and measure the agreement between key (or gold standard) entities and response (or system-generated) enti-ties, while MUC and BLANC-gold are link-based.",
        "In particular, MUC measures the degree of agreement between key coreference links (i.e., links among mentions within entities) and response coreference links, while non-coreference links (i.e., links formed by mentions from different entities) are not explicitly taken into account.",
        "This leads to a phenomenon where coreference systems outputting large entities are scored more favorably than those outputting small entities (Luo, 2005).",
        "BLANC (Recasens and Hovy, 2011), on the other hand, considers both coreference links and non-coreference links.",
        "It calculates recall, precision and F-measure separately on coreference and non-coreference links in the usual way, and defines the overall recall, precision and F-measure as the mean of the respective measures for coreference and non-coreference links.",
        "The BLANC-gold metric was developed with the assumption that response mentions and key mentions are identical.",
        "In reality, however, mentions need to be detected from natural language text and the result is, more often than not, im-perfect: some key mentions may be missing in the response, and some response mentions may be spurious?so-called ?twinless?",
        "mentions by Stoy-anov et al. (2009).",
        "Therefore, the identical-mention-set assumption limits BLANC-gold's applicability when gold mentions are not available, or when one wants to have a single score measuring both the quality of mention detection and coreference resolution.",
        "The goal of this paper is to extend the BLANC-gold metric to imperfect response mentions.",
        "We first briefly review the original definition of BLANC, and rewrite its definition using set notation.",
        "We then argue that the gold-mention assumption in Recasens and Hovy (2011) can be lifted without changing the original definition.",
        "In fact, the proposed BLANC metric subsumes the original one in that its value is identical to the original one when response mentions are identical to key mentions.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "We introduce the notions used in this paper in Section 2.",
        "We then present the original BLANC-gold in Section 3 using the set notation defined in Section 2.",
        "This paves the way to generalize it to 24 imperfect system mentions, which is presented in Section 4.",
        "The proposed BLANC is applied to the CoNLL 2011 and 2012 shared task participants, and the scores and its correlations with existing metrics are shown in Section 5.",
        "2 Notations To facilitate the presentation, we define the notations used in the paper.",
        "We use key to refer to gold standard mentions or entities, and response to refer to system mentions or entities.",
        "The collection of key entities is denoted by K = {k i } |K| i=1 , where k i is the i th key entity; accordingly, R = {r j } |R| j=1 is the set of response entities, and r j is the j th response entity.",
        "We assume that mentions in {k i } and {r j } are unique; in other words, there is no duplicate mention.",
        "Let C k (i) and C r (j) be the set of coreference links formed by mentions in k i and r j : C k (i) = {(m 1 ,m 2 ) : m 1 ?",
        "k i ,m 2 ?",
        "k i ,m 1 6= m 2 } C r (j) = {(m 1 ,m 2 ) : m 1 ?",
        "r j ,m 2 ?",
        "r j ,m 1 6= m 2 } As can be seen, a link is an undirected edge between two mentions, and it can be equivalently represented by a pair of mentions.",
        "Note that when an entity consists of a single mention, its coreference link set is empty.",
        "Let N k (i, j) (i 6= j) be key non-coreference links formed between mentions in k i and those in k j , and let N r (i, j) (i 6= j) be response non-coreference links formed between mentions in r i and those in r j , respectively: N k (i, j) = {(m 1 ,m 2 ) : m 1 ?",

        "r i ,m 2 ?",
        "r j } Note that the non-coreference link set is empty when all mentions are in the same entity.",
        "We use the same letter and subscription without the index in parentheses to denote the union of sets, e.g., C k = ?",
        "i C k (i), N k = ?",
        "i 6=j N k (i, j) C r = ?",

        "i6=j N r (i, j) We use T k = C k ?",
        "N k and T r = C r ?",
        "N r to denote the total set of key links and total set of response links, respectively.",
        "Clearly, C k and N k form a partition of T k since C k ?",
        "N k = ?, T k = C k ?N k .",
        "Likewise, C r and N r form a partition of T r .",
        "We say that a key link l 1 ?",
        "T k equals a response link l 2 ?",
        "T r if and only if the pair of mentions from which the links are formed are identical.",
        "We write l 1 = l 2 if two links are equal.",
        "It is easy to see that the gold mention assumption?same set of response mentions as the set of key mentions?",
        "can be equivalently stated as T k = T r (this does not necessarily mean that C k = C r or N k = N r ).",
        "We also use | ?",
        "| to denote the size of a set.",
        "3 Original BLANC BLANC-gold is adapted from Rand Index (Rand, 1971), a metric for clustering objects.",
        "Rand Index is defined as the ratio between the number of correct within-cluster links plus the number of correct cross-cluster links, and the total number of links.",
        "When T k = T r , Rand Index can be applied directly since coreference resolution reduces to a clustering problem where mentions are partitioned into clusters (entities): Rand Index = |C k ?",

        "1) ) (1) In practice, though, the simple-minded adoption of Rand Index is not satisfactory since the number of non-coreference links often overwhelms that of coreference links (Recasens and Hovy, 2011), or, |N k | |C k | and |N r | |C r |.",
        "Rand Index, if used without modification, would not be sensitive to changes of coreference links.",
        "BLANC-gold solves this problem by averaging the F-measure computed over coreference links and the F-measure over non-coreference links.",
        "Using the notations in Section 2, the recall, pre-cision, and F-measure on coreference links are: R (g) c = |C k ?",

        "(8) Superscript g in these equations highlights the fact that they are meant for coreference systems with gold mentions.",
        "Eqn. (8) indicates that BLANC-gold assigns equal weight to F (g) c , the F-measure from coreference links, and F (g) n , the F-measure from non-coreference links.",
        "This avoids the problem that |N k | |C k | and |N r | |C r |, should the original Rand Index be used.",
        "In Eqn. (2) - (3) and Eqn. (5) - (6), denominators are written as a sum of disjoint subsets so they can be related to the contingency table in (Recasens and Hovy, 2011).",

        "However, when response mentions are not identical to key mentions, a key coreference link may not appear in either C r or N r , so Equations (2) to (7) cannot be applied directly to systems with imperfect mentions.",

        "Proof.",
        "We only need to show that R c = R (g) c , P c = P (g) c , R n = R (g) n , and P n = P (g) n .",

        "So the correlations will likely be lower on data sets with singleton entities.",
        "6 Conclusion The original BLANC-gold (Recasens and Hovy, 2011) requires that system mentions be identical to gold mentions, which limits the metric's utility since detected system mentions often have missing key mentions or spurious mentions.",
        "The proposed BLANC is free from this assumption, and we have shown that it subsumes the original BLANC-gold.",
        "Since BLANC works on imperfect system mentions, we have used it to score the CoNLL 2011 and 2012 coreference systems.",
        "The BLANC scores show strong correlation with existing met-rics, especially B-cubed and CEAF-m. Acknowledgments We would like to thank the three anonymous reviewers for their invaluable suggestions for improving the paper.",
