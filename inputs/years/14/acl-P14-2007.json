        "The effort required by a human annotator to detect sentiment is not uniform for all texts.",
        "Compare the hypothetical tweet ?Just what I wanted: a good pizza.?",
        "with ?Just what I wanted: a cold pizza.?.",
        "The two are lexically and structurally similar.",
        "However, because of the sarcasm in the second tweet (in ?cold?",
        "pizza, an undesirable situation followed by a positive sentiment phrase ?just what I wanted?, as discussed in Riloff et al. (2013)), it is more complex than the first for sentiment annotation.",
        "Thus, independent of how good ?",
        "Aditya is funded by the TCS Research Fellowship Program.",
        "the annotator is, there are sentences which will be perceived to be more complex than others.",
        "With regard to this, we introduce a metric called sentiment annotation complexity (SAC).",
        "The SAC of a given piece of text (sentences, in our case) can be predicted using the linguistic properties of the text as features.",
        "The primary question is whether such complexity measurement is necessary at all.",
        "Fort et al (2012) describe the necessity of annotation complexity measurement in manual annotation tasks.",
        "Measuring annotation complexity is beneficial in annotation crowdsourcing.",
        "If the complexity of the text can be estimated even before the annotation begins, the pricing model can be fine-tuned (pay less for sentences that are easy to annotate, for example).",
        "Also, in terms of an automatic SA engine which has multiple classifiers in its ensem-ble, a classifier may be chosen based on the complexity of sentiment annotation (for example, use a rule-based classifier for simple sentences and a more complex classifier for other sentences).",
        "Our metric adds value to sentiment annotation and sentiment analysis, in these two ways.",
        "The fact that sentiment expression may be complex is evident from a study of comparative sentences by Gana-pathibhotla and Liu (2008), sarcasm by Riloff et al. (2013), thwarting by Ramteke et al. (2013) or implicit sentiment by Balahur et al. (2011).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, there is no general approach to ?measure?",
        "how complex a piece of text is, in terms of sentiment annotation.",
        "The central challenge here is to annotate a data set with SAC.",
        "To measure the ?actual?",
        "time spent by an annotator on a piece of text, we use an eye-tracker to record eye-fixation duration: the time for which the annotator has actually focused on the sentence during annotation.",
        "Eye-tracking annotations have been used to study the cognitive aspects of language processing tasks like translation by Dragsted (2010) and sense disambiguation by 36 Joshi et al. (2011).",
        "Mishra et al. (2013) present a technique to determine translation difficulty index.",
        "The work closest to ours is by Scott et al. (2011) who use eye-tracking to study the role of emotion words in reading.",
        "The novelty of our work is three-fold: (a) The proposition of a metric to measure complexity of sentiment annotation, (b) The adaptation of past work that uses eye-tracking for NLP in the context of sentiment annotation, (c) The learning of regressors that automatically predict SAC using linguistic features.",
        "2 Understanding Sentiment Annotation Complexity The process of sentiment annotation consists of two sub-processes: comprehension (where the annotator understands the content) and sentiment judgment (where the annotator identifies the sen-timent).",
        "The complexity in sentiment annotation stems from an interplay of the two and we expect SAC to capture the combined complexity of both the sub-processes.",
        "In this section, we describe how complexity may be introduced in sentiment annotation in different classical layers of NLP.",
        "The simplest form of sentiment annotation complexity is at the lexical level.",
        "Consider the sentence ?It is messy, uncouth, incomprehensible, vicious and absurd?.",
        "The sentiment words used in this sentence are uncommon, resulting in complexity.",
        "The next level of sentiment annotation complexity arises due to syntactic complexity.",
        "Consider the review: ?A somewhat crudely constructed but gripping, questing look at a person so racked with self-loathing, he becomes an enemy to his own race.?.",
        "An annotator will face difficulty in comprehension as well as sentiment judgment due to the complicated phrasal structure in this review.",
        "Implicit expression of sentiment introduces complexity at the semantic and pragmatic level.",
        "Sarcasm expressed in ?It's like an all-star salute to disney's cheesy commercialism?",
        "leads to difficulty in sentiment annotation because of positive words like ?an all-star salute?.",
        "Manual annotation of complexity scores may not be intuitive and reliable.",
        "Hence, we use a cognitive technique to create our annotated dataset.",
        "The underlying idea is: if we monitor annotation of two textual units of equal length, the more complex unit will take longer to annotate, and hence, should have a higher SAC.",
        "Using the idea of ?an- notation time?",
        "linked with complexity, we devise a technique to create a dataset annotated with SAC.",
        "It may be thought that inter-annotator agreement (IAA) provides implicit annotation: the higher the agreement, the easier the piece of text is for sentiment annotation.",
        "However, in case of multiple expert annotators, this agreement is expected to be high for most sentences, due to the expertise.",
        "For example, all five annotators agree with the label for 60% sentences in our data set.",
        "However, the duration for these sentences has a mean of 0.38 seconds and a standard deviation of 0.27 seconds.",
        "This indicates that although IAA is easy to compute, it does not determine sentiment annotation complexity of text in itself.",
        "3 Creation of dataset annotated with SAC We wish to predict sentiment annotation complexity of the text using a supervised technique.",
        "As stated above, the time-to-annotate is one good candidate.",
        "However, ?simple time measurement?",
        "is not reliable because the annotator may spend time not doing any annotation due to fatigue or distraction.",
        "To accurately record the time, we use an eye-tracking device that measures the ?duration of eye-fixations 1 ?.",
        "Another attribute recorded by the eye-tracker that may have been used is ?saccade duration 2 ?.",
        "However, saccade duration is not significant for annotation of short text, as in our case.",
        "Hence, the SAC labels of our dataset are fixation durations with appropriate normalization.",
        "It may be noted that the eye-tracking device is used only to annotate training data.",
        "The actual prediction of SAC is done using linguistic features alone.",
        "3.1 Eye-tracking Experimental Setup We use a sentiment-annotated data set consisting of movie reviews by (Pang and Lee, 2005) and tweets from http://help.sentiment140.",
        "com/for-students.",
        "A total of 1059 sentences (566 from a movie corpus, 493 from a twitter corpus) are selected.",
        "We then obtain two kinds of annotation from five paid annotators: (a) sentiment (positive, negative and objective), (b) eye-movement as recorded 1 A long stay of the visual gaze on a single location.",
        "2 A rapid movement of the eyes between positions of rest on the sentence.",
        "37 Figure 1: Gaze-data recording using Translog-II by an eye-tracker.",
        "They are given a set of instructions beforehand and can seek clarifications.",
        "This experiment is conducted as follows: 1.",
        "A sentence is displayed to the annotator on the screen.",
        "The annotator verbally states the sentiment of this sentence, before (s)he can proceed to the next.",
        "2.",
        "While the annotator reads the sentence, a remote eye-tracker (Model: Tobii TX 300, Sampling rate: 300Hz) records the eye-movement data of the annotator.",
        "The eye-tracker is linked to a Translog II software (Carl, 2012) in order to record the data.",
        "A snapshot of the software is shown in figure 1.",
        "The dots and circles represent position of eyes and fixations of the annotator respectively.",
        "3.",
        "The experiment then continues in modules of 50 sentences at a time.",
        "This is to prevent fatigue over a period of time.",
        "Thus, each annotator participates in this experiment over a number of sittings.",
        "We ensure the quality of our dataset in different ways: (a) Our annotators are instructed to avoid unnecessary head movements and eye-movements outside the experiment environment.",
        "(b) To minimize noise due to head movements further, they are also asked to state the annotation verbally, which was then manually recorded, (c) Our annotators are students between the ages 20-24 with English as the primary language of academic instruction and have secured a TOEFL iBT score of 110 or above.",
        "We understand that sentiment is nuanced-to- wards a target, through constructs like sarcasm and presence of multiple entities.",
        "However, we want to capture the most natural form of sentiment annotation.",
        "So, the guidelines are kept to a bare minimum of ?annotating a sentence as positive, negative and objective as per the speaker?.",
        "This experiment results in a data set of 1059 sentences with a fixation duration recorded for each sentence-annotator pair 3 The multi-rater kappa IAA for sentiment annotation is 0.686.",
        "3.2 Calculating SAC from eye-tracked data We now need to annotate each sentence with a SAC.",
        "We extract fixation durations of the five annotators for each of the annotated sentences.",
        "A single SAC score for sentence s for N annotators is computed as follows: SAC(s) = 1 N N ?",
        "n=1 z(n,dur(s,n)) len(s) where, z(n, dur(s, n)) = dur(s,n)??",
        "(dur(n)) ?",
        "(dur(n)) (1) In the above formula, N is the total number of annotators while n corresponds to a specific annotator.",
        "dur(s, n) is the fixation duration of annotator n on sentence s. len(s) is the number of words in sentence s. This normalization over number of words assumes that long sentences may have high dur(s, n) but do not necessarily have high SACs.",
        "?",
        "(dur(n)), ?",
        "(dur(n)) is the mean and standard deviation of fixation durations for annotator n across all sentences.",
        "z(n, .)",
        "is a function that z-normalizes the value for annotator n to standardize the deviation due to reading speeds.",
        "We convert the SAC values to a scale of 1-10 using min-max normalization.",
        "To understand how the formula records sentiment annotation complexity, consider the SACs of examples in section 2.",
        "The sentence ?it is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd?",
        "has a SAC of 3.3.",
        "On the other hand, the SAC for the sarcastic sentence ?it's like an all-star salute to disney's cheesy commer-cialism.?",

        "To predict SAC, we use Support Vector Regression (SVR) (Joachims, 2006).",
        "Since we do not have any information about the nature of the relationship between the features and SAC, choosing SVR allows us to try multiple kernels.",
        "We carry out a 5-fold cross validation for both in-domain and cross-domain settings, to validate that the regressor does not overfit.",

        "MaxEnt has the highest negative correlation of -0.29 and -0.26.",
        "For both domains, we observe a weak yet negative correlation which suggests that the perception of difficulty by the classifiers are in line with that of humans, as captured through SAC.",
        "6 Conclusion & Future Work We presented a metric called Sentiment Annotation Complexity (SAC), a metric in SA research that has been unexplored until now.",
        "First, the process of data preparation through eye tracking, labeled with the SAC score was elaborated.",
        "Using this data set and a set of linguistic features, we trained a regression model to predict SAC.",
        "Our predictive framework for SAC resulted in a mean percentage error of 22.02%, and a moderate correlation of 0.57 between the predicted and observed SAC values.",
        "Finally, we observe a negative correlation between the classifier confidence scores and a SAC, as expected.",
        "As a future work, we would like to investigate how SAC of a test sentence can be used to choose a classifier from an ensemble, and to determine the pre-processing steps (entity- relationship extraction, for example).",
