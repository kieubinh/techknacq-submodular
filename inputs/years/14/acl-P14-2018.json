        "Wordnets are intricate and substantive repositories of lexical knowledge and have become important resources for computational processing of natural languages and for information retrieval.",
        "Good quality Wordnets are available only for a few \"resource-rich\" languages such as English and Japanese.",
        "Published approaches to automatically build new Wordnets are manual or semi-automatic and can be used only for languages that already possess some lexical resources.",
        "The Princeton Wordnet (PWN) (Fellbaum, 1998) was painstakingly constructed manually over many decades.",
        "Wordnets, except the PWN, have been usually constructed by one of two approaches.",
        "The first approach translates the PWN to T (Bilgin et al., 2004), (Barbu and Mititelu, 2005), (Kaji and Watanabe, 2006), (Sagot and Fi?er, 2008), (Saveski and Trajkovsk, 2010) and (Oliver and Climent, 2012); while the second approach builds a Wordnet in T, and then aligns it with the PWN by generating translations (Gu- nawan and Saputra, 2010).",
        "In terms of popular-ity, the first approach dominates over the second approach.",
        "Wordnets generated using the second approach have different structures from the PWN; however, the complex agglutinative morphology, culture specific meanings and usages of words and phrases of target languages can be maintained.",
        "In contrast, Wordnets created using the first approach have the same structure as the PWN.",
        "One of our goals is to automatically generate high quality synsets, each of which is a set of cognitive synonyms, for Wordnets having the same structure as the PWN in several languages.",
        "Therefore, we use the first approach to construct Wordnets.",
        "This paper discusses the first step of a project to automatically build core Wordnets for languages with low amounts of resources (viz., Arabic and Vietnamese), resource-poor languages (viz., Assamese) or endangered languages (viz., Dimasa and Karbi) 1 .",
        "The sizes and the qualities of freely existing resources, if any, for these languages vary, but are not usually high.",
        "Hence, our second goal is to use a limited number of freely available resources in the target languages as input to our algorithms to ensure that our methods can be felicitously used with languages that lack much resource.",
        "In addition, our approaches need to have a capability to reduce noise coming from the existing resources that we use.",
        "For transla-tion, we use a free machine translator (MT) and restrict ourselves to using it as the only \"dictio- nary\" we can have.",
        "For research purposes, we have obtained free access to the Microsoft Translator, which supports translations among 44 languages.",
        "In particular, given public Wordnets aligned to the PWN ( such as the FinnWordNet (FWN) (Lind?n, 2010) and the JapaneseWordNet (JWN) (Isahara et al., 2008) ) and the Microsoft Translator, we build Wordnet synsets for arb, asm, dis, ajz and vie.",
        "1 ISO 693-3 codes of Arabic, Assamese, Dimasa, Karbi and Vietnamese are arb, asm, dis, ajz and vie, respectively.",
        "106 2 Proposed approaches In this section, we propose approaches to create Wordnet synsets for a target languages T using existing Wordnets and the MT and/or a single bilingual dictionary.",
        "We take advantage of the fact that every synset in PWN has a unique offset-POS, referring to the offset for a synset with a particular part-of-speech (POS) from the beginning of its data file.",
        "Each synset may have one or more words, each of which may be in one or more synsets.",
        "Words in a synset have the same sense.",
        "The basic idea is to extract corresponding synsets for each offset-POS from existing Wordnets linked to PWN, in several languages.",
        "Next, we translate extracted synsets in each language to T to produce so-called synset candidates using MT.",
        "Then, we apply a ranking method on these candidates to find the correct words for a specific offset-POS in T. 2.1 Generating synset candidates We propose three approaches to generate synset candidates for each offset-POS in T. 2.1.1 The direct translation (DR) approach The first approach directly translates synsets in PWN to T as in Figure 1.",
        "Figure 1: The DR approach to construct Wordnet synsets in a target language T. For each offset-POS, we extract words in that synset from the PWN and translate them to the target language to generate translation candidates.",
        "2.1.2 Approach using intermediate Wordnets (IW) To handle ambiguities in synset translation, we propose the IW approach as in Figure 2.",
        "Publicly available Wordnets in various languages, which we call intermediate Wordnets, are used as resources to create synsets for Wordnets.",
        "For each offset-POS, we extract its corresponding synsets from intermediate Wordnets.",
        "Then, the extracted synsets, which are in different languages, are translated to T using MT to generate synset candidates.",
        "Depending on which Wordnets are used and the number of intermediate Wordnets, the number of candidates in each synset and the number of synsets in the new Wordnets change.",
        "Figure 2: The IW approach to construct Wordnet synsets in a target language T 2.1.3 Approach using intermediate Wordnets and a dictionary (IWND) The IW approach for creating Wordnet synsets decreases ambiguities in translations.",
        "However, we need more than one bilingual dictionary from each intermediate languages to T. Such dictionaries are not always available for many languages, especially the ones that are resource poor.",
        "The IWND approach is like the IW approach, but instead of translating immediately from the intermediate languages to the target language, we translate synsets extracted from intermediate Wordnets to English (eng), then translate them to the target language.",
        "The IWND approach is presented in Figure 3.",
        "Figure 3: The IWND approach to construct Wordnet synsets 107 2.2 Ranking method For each of offset-POS, we have many translation candidates.",
        "A translation candidate with a higher rank is more likely to become a word belonging to the corresponding offset-POS of the new Wordnet in the target language.",
        "Candidates having the same ranks are treated similarly.",
        "The rank value in the range 0.00 to 1.00.",
        "The rank of a word w, the so-called rank w , is computed as below.",
        "rank w = occur w numCandidates ?",
        "numDstWordnets numWordnets where: numCandidates is the total number of translation candidates of an offset-POS occur w is the occurrence count of the word w in the numCandidates numWordnets is the number of intermediate Wordnets used, and numDstWordnets is the number of distinct intermediate Wordnets that have words translated to the word w in the target language.",
        "Our motivation for this rank formula is the following.",
        "If a candidate has a higher occurrence count, it has a greater chance to become a correct translation.",
        "Therefore, the occurrence count of each candidate needs to be taken into account.",
        "We normalize the occurrence count of a word by dividing it by numCandidates.",
        "In addition, if a candidate is translated from different words having the same sense in different languages, this candidate is more likely to be a correct translation.",
        "Hence, we multiply the first fraction by numDst-Wordnets.",
        "To normalize, we divide results by the number of intermediate Wordnet used.",
        "For instance, in our experiments we use 4 intermediate Wordnets, viz., PWN, FWN, JWN and WOLF Wordnet (WWN) (Sagot and Fi?er, 2008).",
        "The words in the offset-POS \"00006802-v\" obtained from all 4 Wordnets, their translations to arb, the occurrence count and the rank of each translation are presented in the second, the fourth and the fifth columns, respectively, of Figure 4.",
        "2.3 Selecting candidates based on ranks We separate candidates based on three cases as below.",
        "Case 1: A candidate w has the highest chance to become a correct word belonging to a specific synset in the target language if its rank is 1.0.",
        "This means that all intermediate Wordnets contain the synset having a specific offset-POS and all words belonging to these synsets are translated to the Figure 4: Example of calculating the ranks of candidates translated from words belonging to the offset-POS \"00006802-v\" in 4 Wordnets: PWN, FWN, JWN and WWN.",
        "The word A , word B and word C are obtained from PWN, FWN and WWN, respectively.",
        "The JWN does not contain this offset-POS.",
        "TL presents transliterations of the words in arb.",
        "The numWordnets is 4 and the numCandidates is 7.",
        "The rank of each candidate is shown in the last column of Figure 4. same word w. The more the number of intermediate Wordnets used, the higher the chance the candidate with the rank of 1.0 has to become the correct translation.",
        "Therefore, we accept all translations that satisfy this criterion.",
        "An example of this scenario is presented in Figure 5.",
        "Figure 5: Example of Case 1: Using the IW approach with four intermediate Wordnets, PWN, FWN, JWN and WWN.",
        "All words belonging to the offSet-POS \"00952615-n\" in all 4 Wordnets are translated to the same word \"?i?n\" in vie.",
        "The word \"?i?n\" is accepted as the correct word belonging to the offSet-POS \"00952615-n\" in the Vietnamese Wordnet we create.",
        "Case 2: If an offSet-POS does not have candidates having the rank of 1.0, we accept the candidates having the greatest rank.",
        "Figure 6 shows the example of the second scenario.",
        "Case 3: If all candidates of an offSet-POS has the same rank which is also the greatest rank, we 108 Figure 6: Example of Case 2: Using the IW approach with three intermediate Wordnets, PWN, FWN and WWN.",
        "For the offSet-POS \"01437254- v\", there is no candidate with the rank of 1.0.",
        "The highest rank of the candidates in \"vie\" is 0.67 which is the word g?i.",
        "We accept \"g?i\" as the correct word in the offSet-POS \"01437254-v\" in the Vietnamese Wordnet we create.",
