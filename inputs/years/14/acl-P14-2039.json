        "Real-time captioning provides deaf or hard of hearing people access to speech in mainstream classrooms, at public events, and on live television.",
        "Studies performed in the classroom setting show that the latency between when a word was said and when it is displayed must be under five seconds to maintain consistency between the captions being read and other visual cues (Wald, 2005; Kushalnagar et al., 2014).",
        "The most common approach to real-time captioning is to recruit a trained stenographer with a special purpose phonetic keyboard, who transcribes the speech to text with less than five seconds of latency.",

        "Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems (Saraclar et al., 2002), on the other hand, attempts to provide a cheap and fully automated solution to this problem.",
        "However, the accuracy of ASR quickly plummets to below 30% when used on an untrained speaker's voice, in a new environ-ment, or in the absence of a high quality microphone (Wald, 2006).",
        "The accuracy of the ASR systems can be improved using the ?re-speaking?",
        "technique, which requires a person that the ASR has been trained on to repeat the words said by a speaker as he hears them.",
        "Simultaneously hearing and speaking, however, is not straightforward, and requires some training.",
        "An alternative approach is to combine the efforts of multiple non-expert captionists (anyone who can type), instead of relying on trained workers (Lasecki et al., 2012; Naim et al., 2013).",
        "In this approach, multiple non-expert human workers transcribe an audio stream containing speech in real-time.",
        "Workers type as much as they can of 236 the input, and, while no one worker's transcript is complete, the portions captured by various workers tend to overlap.",
        "For each input word, a time-stamp is recorded, indicating when the word is typed by a worker.",
        "The partial inputs are combined to produce a final transcript (see Figure 1).",
        "This approach has been shown to dramatically outperform ASR in terms of both accuracy and Word Error Rate (WER) (Lasecki et al., 2012; Naim et al., 2013).",
        "Furthermore, recall of individual words irrespective of their order approached and even exceeded that of a trained expert stenographer with seven workers contributing, suggesting that the information is present to meet the performance of a stenographer (Lasecki et al., 2012).",
        "However, aligning these individual words in the correct sequential order remains a challenging problem.",
        "Lasecki et al. (2012) addressed this alignment problem using off-the-shelf multiple sequence alignment tools, as well as an algorithm based on incrementally building a precedence graph over output words.",

        "First, aligning disjoint chunks independently tends to introduce a large number of errors at the boundary of each chunk.",
        "This is because the chunk boundaries are defined with respect to the timestamps associated with each word in the captions, but the timestamps can vary greatly between words that should in fact be aligned.",
        "After all, if the timestamps corresponded precisely to the original time at which each word was spoken, the entire alignment problem would be trivial.",
        "The fact that the various instances of a single word in each transcription may fall on either side of a chunk boundary leads to errors where a word is either duplicated in the final output for more than one chunk, or omitted entirely.",
        "This problem also causes errors in ordering among the words remaining within one chunk, because there is less information available to constrain the ordering relations between transcriptions.",
        "Second, the fixed window alignment algorithm requires longer chunks (?",
        "10 seconds) to obtain reasonable accu-racy, and thus introduces unsatisfactory latency.",
        "3 Sliding Alignment Windows In order to address the problems described above, we explore a technique based on a sliding alignment window, shown in Algorithm 3.",
        "We start with alignment with a fixed chunk size.",
        "After aligning the first chunk, we use the information derived from the alignment to determine where the next chunk should begin within each transcription.",
        "We use a single point in the aligned output as the starting point for the next chunk, and determine the corresponding starting position within each original transcription.",

        "We set the heuristic weight parameter (w) to 3 and the chunk size parameter (c) to 5 seconds for all the three sliding window systems and the fixed window system.",
        "Sliding alignment window produces better results and outperforms the other algorithms even for large values of the keep-length parameter.",
        "The sliding alignment window with keep-length 0.5 achieves 0.5679 average accuracy in terms of (1-WER), providing a 18.09% improvement with respect to the most accurate fixed alignment window (average accuracy 0.4857).",
        "On the same dataset, Lasecki et al. (2012) reported 36.6% accuracy using the Dragon Naturally Speaking ASR system (version 11.5 for Win-dows).",
        "To show the trade-off between latency and ac-curacy, we fix the heuristic weight (w = 3) and plot the accuracy as a function of chunk size in Figure 3.",
        "We repeat this experiment for different values of keep-length.",
        "We observe that the sliding window approach dominates the fixed window approach across a wide range of chunk sizes.",
        "Fur-thermore, we can see that for smaller values of the chunk size parameter, increasing the keep-length makes the system less accurate.",
        "As the chunk size parameter increases, the performance of sliding window systems with different values of keep-length parameter converges.",
        "Therefore, at larger chunk sizes, for which there are smaller number of boundaries, the keep-length parameter has lower impact.",
        "Next, we show the trade-off between computation speed and accuracy in Figure 3, as we fix the heuristic weight and vary the chunk size over the range [5, 10, 15, 20, 30] seconds.",
        "Larger chunks are more accurately aligned but require computation time that grows as N K in the chunk size N in the worst case.",
        "Furthermore, smaller weights allow faster alignment, but provide lower accuracy.",
        "5 Conclusion In this paper, we present a novel sliding window based text alignment algorithm for real-time crowd captioning.",
        "By effectively addressing the problem of alignment errors at chunk boundaries, our sliding window approach outperforms the existing fixed window based system (Naim et al., 2013) in terms of word error rate, particularly when the chunk size is small, and thus achieves higher accuracy at lower latency.",
