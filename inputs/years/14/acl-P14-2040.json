        "As the volume of online documents has drastically increased, the analysis of topic bursts, topic drift or detection of topic is a practical problem attracting more and more attention (Allan et al., 1998; Swan and Allan, 2000; Allan, 2003; Klinken-berg, 2004; Lazarescu et al., 2004; Folino et al., 2007).",
        "The earliest known approach is the work of Klinkenberg and Joachims (Klinkenberg and Joachims, 2000).",
        "They have attempted to handle concept changes by focusing a window with documents sufficiently close to the target concept.",
        "Mane et.",
        "al. proposed a method to generate maps that support the identification of major research topics and trends (Mane and Borner, 2004).",
        "The method used Kleinberg's burst detection al-gorithm, co-occurrences of words, and graph layout technique.",
        "Scholz et.",
        "al. have attempted to use different ensembles obtained by training several data streams to detect concept drift (Scholz, 2007).",
        "However the ensemble method itself remains a problem that how to manage several classifiers effectively.",
        "He and Parket attempted to find bursts, periods of elevated occurrence of events as a dynamic phenomenon instead of focusing on arrival rates (He and Parker, 2010).",
        "However, the fact that topics are widely distributed in the stream of documents, and sometimes they frequently appear in the documents, and sometimes not often hamper such attempts.",
        "This paper proposes a method for detecting topic over time in series of documents.",
        "We reinforced words related to a topic with low frequencies by collecting documents from the corpus, and applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) to these documents in order to extract topic candidates.",
        "For the results of LDA, we applied Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) to find topic words while He et.",
        "al., applied it to find bursts.",
        "The MACD is a technique to analyze stock market trends (Murphy, 1999).",
        "It shows the relationship between two moving averages of prices modeling bursts as intervals of topic dynamics, i.e., positive acceleration.",
        "Fukumoto et.",
        "al also applied MACD to find topics.",
        "However, they applied it only to the words with high frequencies in the documents (Fukumoto et al., 2013).",
        "In contrast, we applied it to the topic candidates obtained by LDA.",
        "We examined our method by extrinsic evalua-tion, i.e., we applied the results of topic detection to extractive multi-document summarization.",
        "We assume that a salient sentence includes words related to the target topic, and an event of each documents.",
        "Here, an event is something that occurs at a specific place and time associated with some specific actions(Allan et al., 1998).",
        "We identified event words by using the traditional tf?idf method applied to the results of named entities.",
        "Each sentence in documents is represented using a vector of frequency weighted words that can be event 241 or topic words.",
