        "The recent success and proliferation of statistical machine translation (MT) systems raise a number of important questions.",
        "Prominent among these are how to evaluate the quality of such a system efficiently and how to detect the output of such systems (for example, to avoid using it circularly as input for refining MT systems).",
        "In this paper, we will answer both these questions.",
        "First, we will show that using style-related linguistic features, such as frequencies of parts-of-speech n-grams and function words, it is possible to learn classifiers that distinguish machine-translated text from human-translated or native English text.",
        "While this is a straightforward and not entirely novel result, our main contribution is to relativize the result.",
        "We will see that the success of such classifiers are strongly correlated with the quality of the underlying machine translation system.",
        "Specifically, given a corpus consisting of both machine-translated English text (English being the target language) and native English text (not necessarily the reference translation of the machine-translated text), we measure the accuracy of the system in classifying the sentences in the corpus as machine-translated or not.",
        "This accuracy will be shown to decrease as the quality of the underlying MT system increases.",
        "In fact, the correlation is strong enough that we propose that this accuracy measure itself can be used as a measure of MT system quality, obviating the need for a reference corpus, as for example is necessary for BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001).",
        "The paper is structured as follows: In the next section, we review previous related work.",
        "In the third section, we describe experiments regarding the detection of machine translation and in the fourth section we discuss the use of detection techniques as a machine translation quality estimation method.",
        "In the final section we offer conclusions and suggestions for future work.",
        "2 Previous Work 2.1 Translationese The special features of translated texts have been studied widely for many years.",
        "Attempts to define their characteristics, often called ?Translation Universals?, include (Toury, 1980; Blum-Kulka and Levenston, 1983; Baker, 1993; Gellerstam, 1986).",
        "The differences between native and translated texts found there go well beyond systematic translation errors and point to a distinct ?Transla- tionese?",
        "dialect.",
        "Using automatic text classification methods in the field of translation studies had many use cases in recent years, mainly as an empirical method of measuring, proving or contradicting translation universals.",
        "Several works (Baroni and Bernar-dini, 2006; Kurokawa et al., 2009; Ilisei et al., 2010) used text classification techniques in order to distinguish human translated text from native language text at document or paragraph level, using features like word and POS n-grams, proportion of grammatical words in the text, nouns, finite verbs, auxiliary verbs, adjectives, adverbs, nu-289 merals, pronouns, prepositions, determiners, conjunctions etc.",
        "Koppel and Ordan (2011) classified texts to original or translated, using a list of 300 function words taken from LIWC (Pen- nebaker et al., 2001) as features.",
        "Volanski et al. (2013) also tested various hypotheses regarding ?Translationese?, using 32 different linguistically-informed features, to assess the degree to which different sets of features can distinguish between translated and original texts.",
        "2.2 Machine Translation Detection Regarding the detection of machine translated text, Carter and Inkpen (2012) translated the Hansards of the 36th Parliament of Canada using the Microsoft Bing MT web service, and conducted three detection experiments at document level, using unigrams, average token length, and type-token ratio as features.",
        "Arase and Zhou (2013) trained a sentence-level classifier to distinguish machine translated text from human generated text on English and Japanese web-page corpora, translated by Google Translate, Bing and an in-house SMT system.",
        "They achieved very high detection accuracy using application-specific feature sets for this purpose, including indicators of the ?Phrase Salad?",
        "(Lopez, 2008) phenomenon or ?Gappy-Phrases?",
        "(Bansal et al., 2011).",
        "While Arase and Zhou (2013) considered MT detection at sentence level, as we do in this pa-per, they did not study the correlation between the translation quality of the machine translated text and the ability to detect it.",
        "We show below that such detection is possible with very high accuracy only on low-quality translations.",
        "We examine this detection accuracy vs. quality correlation, with various MT systems, such as rule-based and statistical MT, both commercial and in-house, using various feature sets.",
        "3 Detection Experiments 3.1 Features We wish to distinguish machine translated English sentences from either human-translated sentences or native English sentences.",
        "Due to the sparseness of the data at the sentence level, we use common content-independent linguistic features for the classification task.",
        "Our features are binary, denoting the presence or absence of each of a set of part-of-speech n-grams acquired using the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003), as well as the presence or absence of each of 467 function words taken from LIWC (Pennebaker et al., 2001).",
        "We consider only those entries that appear at least ten times in the entire corpus, in order to reduce sparsity in the data.",
        "As our learning algorithm we use SVM with sequential minimal optimization (SMO), taken from the WEKA machine learning toolkit (Hall et al., 2009).",
        "3.2 Detecting Different MT Systems In the first experiment set, we explore the ability to detect outputs of machine translated text from different MT systems, in an environment containing both human generated and machine translated text.",
        "For this task, we use a portion of the Canadian Hansard corpus (Germann, 2001), containing 48,914 parallel sentences from French to English.",
        "We translate the French portion of the corpus using several MT systems, respectively: Google Trans-late, Systran, and five other commercial MT systems available at the http://itranslate4.eu website, which enables to query example MT systems built by several european MT companies.",
        "After translating the sentences, we take 20,000 sentences from each engine output and conduct the detection experiment by labeling those sentences as MT sen-tences, and another 20,000 sentences, which are the human reference translations, labeled as reference sentences.",
        "We conduct a 10-fold cross-validation experiment on the entire 40,000 sentence corpus.",
        "We also conduct the same experiment using 20,000 random, non-reference sentences from the same corpus, instead of the reference sentences.",
        "Using simple linear regression, we also obtain an R 2 value (coefficient of deter-mination) over the measurements of detection accuracy and BLEU score, for each of three feature set combinations (function words, POS tags and mixed) and the two data combinations (MT vs. reference and MT vs. non reference sentences).",
        "The detection and R 2 results are shown in Table 1.",
        "As can be seen, best detection results are obtained using the full combined feature set.",
        "It can also be seen that, as might be expected, it is easier to distinguish machine-translated sentences from a non-reference set than from the reference set.",
        "In Figure 1, we show the relationship of the observed detection accuracy for each system with the BLEU score of that system.",
        "As is evident, regardless of the feature set or non-MT sentences used, the correlation between detection accuracy and BLEU 290 10 20 30 60 70 80 90 BLEU d e t e c t i o n a c c u r a c y ( % ) mix-nr mix-r fw-nr fw-r pos-nr pos-r Figure 1: Correlation between detection accuracy and BLEU score on commercial MT systems, using POS, function words and mixed features against reference and non-reference sentences.",

        "In order to do so, we use the Moses statistical machine translation toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "To train the systems, we take a portion of the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005), creating 7 different SMT systems, each using a different amount of training data, for both the translation model and language model.",
        "We do this in order to create different quality translation systems, details of which are described in Table 3.",

        "The relationship between the detection results for each MT system and the BLEU score for that system, resulting in R 2 = 0.774, is shown in Figure 2.",
        "4 Machine Translation Evaluation 4.1 Human Evaluation Experiments As can be seen in the above experiments, there is a strong correlation between the BLEU score and the MT detection accuracy of our method.",
        "In fact, results are linearly and negatively correlated with BLEU, as can be seen both on commercial systems and our in-house SMT systems.",
        "We also wish to consider the relationship between detection accuracy and a human quality estimation score.",

        "This system is syntax-based, which apparently confound our POS and FW-based classifier, despite it's low human evaluation score.",
        "We hypothesize that the use of syntax-based features might improve results.",
        "To verify this intuition, we create parse trees using the Berkeley parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007) and extract the one-level CFG rules as features.",
        "Again, we represent each sentence as a boolean vector, in which each entry represents the presence or absence of the CFG rule in the parse-tree of the sentence.",
        "Using these features alone, without the FW and POS tag based features presented above, we obtain an R 2 = 0.829 with a proportion of identically ordered pairs at 0.923 (72 of 78), as shown in Figure 5.",
        "5 Discussion and Future Work We have shown that it is possible to detect machine translation from monolingual corpora containing both machine translated text and human generated text, at sentence level.",
        "There is a strong correlation between the detection accuracy that can be obtained and the BLEU score or the human evaluation score of the machine translation itself.",
        "This correlation holds whether or not a reference set is used.",
        "This suggests that our method might be used as an unsupervised quality estimation method when no reference sentences are available, such as for resource-poor source languages.",
        "Further work might include applying our methods to other language pairs and domains, acquiring word-level quality estimation or integrating our method in a machine translation system.",
        "Furthermore, additional features and feature selection techniques can be applied, both for improving detection accuracy and for strengthening the correlation with human quality estimation.",
