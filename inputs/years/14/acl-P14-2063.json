        "Sentiment analysis in a multilingual world remains a challenging problem, because developing language-specific sentiment lexicons is an extremely resource-intensive process.",

        "We integrate a variety of linguistic resources to produce an immense knowledge graph.",
        "By appropriately propagating from seed words, we construct sentiment lexicons for each component language of our graph.",
        "Our lexicons have a polarity agreement of 95.7% with published lexicons, while achieving an overall coverage of 45.2%.",

        "Sentiment analysis of English texts has become a large and active research area, with many commercial applications, but the barrier of language limits the ability to assess the sentiment of most of the world's population.",
        "Although several well-regarded sentiment lexicons are available in English (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Liu, 2010), the same is not true for most of the world's languages.",
        "Indeed, our literature search identified only 12 publicly available sentiment lexicons for only 5 non-English languages (Chinese mandarin, German, Arabic, Japanese and Italian).",
        "No doubt we missed some, but it is clear that these resources are not widely available for most important languages.",

        "Large-Scale Language Knowledge Graph Analysis ?",
        "We have created a massive comprehensive knowledge graph of 7 million vocabulary words from 136 languages with over 131 million semantic inter-language links, which proves valuable when doing alignment between definitions in different languages.",

        "We elucidate the sentiment consistency of entities reported in different language editions of Wikipedia using our propagated lexicons.",
        "In particular, we pick 30 languages and compute sentiment scores for 2,000 distinct historical figures.",

        "Closely related language pairs (i.e. Russian and Ukrainian) share many characters/words in common.",
        "Though not always true, words with same spelling usually have similar meanings so this can improve the coverage of semantic links.",
        "Transliteration provides 22.1% of the total links in our experiment.",
        "?",
        "WordNet ?",
        "Finally, we gather synonyms and antonyms of English words from WordNet, which prove particularly useful in propagating sentiment across languages.",
        "In total we collect over 100,000 pairs of synonyms and antonyms and created 5.0% of the total links.",
        "Links do not always agree in a bidirectional manner, particularly for multi-sense words, thus all links in our network are unidirectional.",

        "The primary difference between is that label propagation takes multiple paths between two vertices into consideration, while graph propagation utilizes only the best path between word pairs.",
        "We report results from using Liu's lexicons (Liu, 2010) as seed words.",
        "Liu's lexicons contain 2006 positive words and 4783 negative words.",

        "Cov reflects what faction of our lexicons overlap with published lexicons.",
        "Our knowledge network is comprised of links from a heterogeneous collection of sources, of different coverage and reliability.",
        "For the task of deciding sentiment polarity of words, only antonym links are negative.",
        "An edge gains zero weight if both negative and positive links exist.",
        "Edges having multiple positive links will be credited the highest weight among all these links.",
        "We conducted a grid search on the weight of each type of links to maximize the best overall accuracy on our test data of published non-English sentiment lexicons.",
        "To avoid potential overfitting problems, grid search starts from SentiWordNet English lexicons (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) instead of Liu?s.",
        "5 Lexicon Evaluation We collected all available published sentiment lexicons from non-English languages to serve as standard for our evaluation, including Arabic, Italian, German and Chinese.",
