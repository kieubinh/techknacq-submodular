        "Sentiment analysis has proved useful in several application scenarios, for instance in buzz monitoring ?",
        "the marketing technique for keeping track of consumer responses to services and products ?",
        "where identifying positive and negative customer experiences helps to assess product and service de-mand, tackle crisis management, etc.",
        "On the other hand, the use of finer-grained mod-els, accounting for the role of individual emotions, is still in its infancy.",
        "The simple division in ?pos- itive?",
        "vs. ?negative?",
        "comments may not suffice, as in these examples: ?I?m so miserable, I dropped my IPhone in the water and now it's not working anymore?",
        "(SADNESS) vs. ?I am very upset, my new IPhone keeps not working!?",
        "(ANGER).",
        "While both texts express a negative sentiment, the latter, connected to anger, is more relevant for buzz monitoring.",
        "Thus, emotion analysis represents a natural evolution of sentiment analysis.",
        "Many approaches to sentiment analysis make use of lexical resources ?",
        "i.e. lists of positive and negative words ?",
        "often deployed as baselines or as features for other methods, usually machine learning based (Liu and Zhang, 2012).",
        "In these lexica, words are associated with their prior polarity, i.e. whether such word out of context evokes something positive or something negative.",
        "For exam-ple, wonderful has a positive connotation ?",
        "prior polarity ?",
        "while horrible has a negative one.",
        "The quest for a high precision and high coverage lexicon, where words are associated with either sentiment or emotion scores, has several reasons.",
        "First, it is fundamental for tasks such as affective modification of existing texts, where words?",
        "polarity together with their score are necessary for creating multiple graded variations of the original text (Inkpen et al., 2006; Guerini et al., 2008; Whitehead and Cavedon, 2010).",
        "Second, considering word order makes a difference in sentiment analysis.",
        "This calls for a role of compositionality, where the score of a sentence is computed by composing the scores of the words up in the syntactic tree.",
        "Works worth mentioning in this connection are: Socher et al. (2013), which uses recursive neural networks to learn compositional rules for sentiment analysis, and (Neviarouskaya et al., 2009; Neviarouskaya et al., 2011) which exploit hand-coded rules to compose the emotions expressed by words in a sentence.",
        "In this respect, compositional approaches represent a new promising trend, since all other approaches, either using semantic similarity or Bag-of-Words (BOW) based machine-learning, cannot handle, for example, cases of texts with same wording but different words order: ?The dangerous killer escaped one month ago, but recently he was ar-rested?",
        "(RELIEF, HAPPYNESS) vs. ?The dangerous killer was arrested one month ago, but re-427 cently he escaped?",
        "(FEAR).",
        "The work in (Wang and Manning, 2012) partially accounts for this problem and argues that using word bigram features allows improving over BOW based meth-ods, where words are taken as features in isolation.",
        "This way it is possible to capture simple compositional phenomena like polarity reversing in ?killing cancer?.",
        "Finally, tasks such as copywriting, where evocative names are a key element to a successful product (Ozbal and Strapparava, 2012; Ozbal et al., 2012) require exhaustive lists of emotion related words.",
        "In such cases no context is given and the brand name alone, with its perceived prior polar-ity, is responsible for stating the area of competition and evoking semantic associations.",
        "For example Mitsubishi changed the name of one of its SUVs for the Spanish market, since the original name Pajero had a very negative prior polarity, as it means ?wanker?",
        "in Spanish (Piller, 2003).",
        "Evoking emotions is also fundamental for a successful name: consider names of a perfume like Obses-sion, or technological products like MacBook air.",
        "In this work, we aim at automatically producing a high coverage and high precision emotion lexicon using distributional semantics, with numerical scores associated with each emotion, like it has already been done for sentiment analysis.",
        "To this end, we take advantage in an original way of massive crowd-sourced affective annotations associated with news articles, obtained by crawling the rappler.com social news network.",
        "We also evaluate our lexicon by integrating it in unsupervised classification and regression settings for emotion recognition.",
        "Results indicate that the use of our resource, even if automatically acquired, is highly beneficial in affective text recognition.",
        "2 Related Work Within the broad field of sentiment analysis, we hereby provide a short review of research efforts put towards building sentiment and emotion lex-ica, regardless of the approach in which such lists are then used (machine learning, rule based or deep learning).",
        "A general overview can be found in (Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu and Zhang, 2012; Wilson et al., 2004; Paltoglou et al., 2010).",
        "Sentiment Lexica.",
        "In recent years there has been an increasing focus on producing lists of words (lexica) with prior polarities, to be used in sentiment analysis.",
        "When building such lists, a trade-off between coverage of the resource and its precision is to be found.",
        "One of the most well-known resources is Senti-WordNet (SWN) (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Bac-cianella et al., 2010), in which each entry is associated with the numerical scores Pos(s) and Neg(s), ranging from 0 to 1.",
        "These scores ?",
        "automatically assigned starting from a bunch of seed terms ?",
        "represent the positive and negative valence (or posterior polarity) of each entry, that takes the form lemma#pos#sense-number.",
        "Starting from SWN, several prior polarities for words (SWN-prior), in the form lemma#PoS, can be computed (e.g. considering only the first-sense, averaging on all the senses, etc.).",
        "These ap-proaches, detailed in (Guerini et al., 2013), produce a list of 155k words, where the lower precision given by the automatic scoring of SWN is compensated by the high coverage.",
        "Another widely used resource is ANEW (Bradley and Lang, 1999), providing valence scores for 1k words, which were manually assigned by several annotators.",
        "This resource has a low coverage, but the precision is maximized.",
        "Similarly, the SO-CAL entries (Taboada et al., 2011) were manually tagged by a small number of annotators with a multi-class label (from very negative to very positive).",
        "These ratings were further validated through crowd-sourcing, ending up with a list of roughly 4k words.",
        "More recently, a resource that replicated ANEW annotation approach using crowd-sourcing, was released (Warriner et al., 2013), providing sentiment scores for 14k words.",
        "Interest-ingly, this resource annotates the most frequent words in English, so, even if lexicon coverage is still far lower than SWN-prior, it grants a high cov-erage, with human precision, of language use.",
        "Finally, the General Inquirer lexicon (Stone et al., 1966) provides a binary classification (positive/negative) of 4k sentiment-bearing words, while the resource in (Wilson et al., 2005) expands the General Inquirer to 6k words.",
        "Emotion Lexica.",
        "Compared to sentiment lexica, far less emotion lexica have been pro-duced, and all have lower coverage.",
        "One of the most used resources is WordNetAffect (Strappa- rava and Valitutti, 2004) which contains manually assigned affective labels to WordNet synsets (ANGER, JOY, FEAR, etc.).",
        "It currently provides 900 annotated synsets and 1.6k words in the form 428 AFRAID AMUSED ANGRY ANNOYED DONT CARE HAPPY INSPIRED SAD doc 10002 0.75 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.25 0.00 doc 10003 0.00 0.50 0.00 0.16 0.17 0.17 0.00 0.00 doc 10004 0.52 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.06 0.02 0.31 doc 10011 0.40 0.00 0.00 0.20 0.00 0.20 0.20 0.00 doc 10028 0.00 0.30 0.08 0.00 0.00 0.23 0.31 0.08 Table 1: An excerpt of the Document-by-Emotion Matrix M DE lemma#PoS#sense, corresponding to roughly 1 thousand lemma#PoS.",

        "3 Dataset Collection To build our emotion lexicon we harvested all the news articles from rappler.com, as of June 3rd 2013: the final dataset consists of 13.5 M words over 25.3 K documents, with an average of 530 words per document.",

        "An excerpt is provided in Table 1.",
        "The idea of using documents annotated with emotions is not new (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2008; Mishne, 2005; Bellegarda, 2010), but these works had the limitation of providing a single emotion label per document, rather than a score for each emotion, and, moreover, the annotation was performed by the author of the document alone.",
        "Table 2 reports the average percentage of votes for each emotion on the whole corpus: HAPPINESS has a far higher percentage of votes (at least three times).",
        "There are several possible explana-tions, out of the scope of the present paper, for this bias: (i) it is due to cultural characteristics of the audience (ii) the bias is in the dataset itself, being formed mainly by ?positive?",
        "news; (iii) it is a psychological phenomenon due to the fact that people tend to express more positive moods on social networks (Quercia et al., 2011; Vittengl and Holt, 1998; De Choudhury et al., 2012).",
        "In any case, the predominance of happy mood has been found in other datasets, for instance LiveJournal.com posts (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2008).",
