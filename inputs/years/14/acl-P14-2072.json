        "The identification of deceptive behavior is a task that has gained increasing interest from researchers in computational linguistics.",
        "This is mainly motivated by the rapid growth of deception in written sources, and in particular in Web content, including product reviews, online dating profiles, and social networks posts (Ott et al., 2011).",
        "To date, most of the work presented on deception detection has focused on the identification of deceit clues within a specific language, where English is the most commonly studied language.",
        "However, a large portion of the written communication (e.g., e-mail, chats, forums, blogs, social networks) occurs not only between speakers of English, but also between speakers from other cultural backgrounds, which poses important questions regarding the applicability of existing deception tools.",
        "Issues such as language, beliefs, and moral values may influence the way people deceive, and therefore may have implications on the construction of tools for deception detection.",
        "In this paper, we explore within- and across-culture deception detection for three different cul-tures, namely United States, India, and Mexico.",
        "Through several experiments, we compare the performance of classifiers that are built separately for each culture, and classifiers that are applied across cultures, by using unigrams and word categories that can act as a cross-lingual bridge.",
        "Our results show that we can achieve accuracies in the range of 60-70%, and that we can leverage resources available in one language to build deception tools for another language.",
        "2 Related Work Research to date on automatic deceit detection has explored a wide range of applications such as the identification of spam in e-mail communication, the detection of deceitful opinions in review web-sites, and the identification of deceptive behavior in computer-mediated communication including chats, blogs, forums and online dating sites (Peng et al., 2011; Toma et al., 2008; Ott et al., 2011; Toma and Hancock, 2010; Zhou and Shi, 2008).",
        "Techniques used for deception detection frequently include word-based stylometric analysis.",
        "Linguistic clues such as n-grams, count of used words and sentences, word diversity, and self-references are also commonly used to identify deception markers.",
        "An important resource that has been used to represent semantic information for the deception task is the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionary (Pennebaker and Francis, 1999).",
        "LIWC provides words grouped into semantic categories relevant to psychological processes, which have been used successfully to perform linguistic profiling of true tellers and liars (Zhou et al., 2003; Newman et al., 2003; Rubin, 2010).",
        "In addition to this, features derived from syntactic Context Free Grammar parse trees, and part of speech have also been found to aid the deceit detection (Feng et al., 2012; Xu and Zhao, 2012).",
        "440 While most of the studies have focused on En-glish, there is a growing interest in studying deception for other languages.",
        "For instance, (Fornaciari and Poesio, 2013) identified deception in Italian by analyzing court cases.",
        "The authors explored several strategies for identifying deceptive clues, such as utterance length, LIWC features, lemmas and part of speech patterns.",
        "(Almela et al., 2012) studied the deception detection in Spanish text by using SVM classifiers and linguistic categories, obtained from the Spanish version of the LIWC dictionary.",
        "A study on Chinese deception is presented in (Zhang et al., 2009), where the authors built a deceptive dataset using Internet news and performed machine learning experiments using a bag-of-words representation to train a classifier able to discriminate between deceptive and truthful cases.",
        "It is also worth mentioning the work conducted to analyze cross-cultural differences.",
        "(Lewis and George, 2008) presented a study of deception in social networks sites and face-to-face communi-cation, where authors compare deceptive behavior of Korean and American participants, with a subsequent study also considering the differences between Spanish and American participants (Lewis and George, 2009).",
        "In general, research findings suggest a strong relation between deception and cultural aspects, which are worth exploring with automatic methods.",
        "3 Datasets We collect three datasets for three different cul-tures: United States (English-US), India (English- India), and Mexico (Spanish-Mexico).",
        "Following (Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2009), we collect short deceptive and truthful essays for three topics: opinions on Abortion, opinions on Death Penalty, and feelings about a Best Friend.",
        "For English-US and English-India, we use Amazon Mechanical Turk with a location restriction, so that all the contributors are from the country of interest (US and India).",
        "We collect 100 deceptive and 100 truthful statements for each of the three topics.",
        "To avoid spam, each contribution is manually verified by one of the authors of this paper.For Spanish-Mexico, while we initially attempted to collect data also using Mechanical Turk, we were not able to receive enough contributions.",
        "We therefore created a separate web interface to collect data, and recruited participants through contacts of the pa-per's authors.",
        "The overall process was significantly more time consuming than for the other two cul-tures, and resulted in fewer contributions, namely 39+39 statements for Abortion, 42+42 statements for Death Penalty, and 94+94 statements for Best Friend.",
        "For all three cultures, the participants first provided their truthful responses, followed by the deceptive ones.",
        "Interestingly, for all three cultures, the average number of words for the deceptive statements (62 words) is significantly smaller than for the truthful statements (81 words), which may be explained by the added difficulty of the deceptive process, and is in line with previous observations about the cues of deception (DePaulo et al., 2003).",
        "4 Experiments Through our experiments, we seek answers to the following questions.",
        "First, what is the performance for deception classifiers built for different cultures?",
        "Second, can we use information drawn from one culture to build a deception classifier for another culture?",
        "Finally, what are the psycholinguistic classes most strongly associated with de-ception/truth, and are there commonalities or differences among languages?",
        "In all our experiments, we formulate the deception detection task in a machine learning frame-work, where we use an SVM classifier to discriminate between deceptive and truthful statements.",
        "1 4.1 What is the performance for deception classifiers built for different cultures?",
        "We represent the deceptive and truthful statements using two different sets of features.",
        "First we use unigrams obtained from the statements corresponding to each topic and each culture.",
        "To select the unigrams, we use a threshold of 10, where all the unigrams with a frequency less than 10 are dropped.",
        "Since previous research suggested that stopwords can contain linguistic clues for deception, no stop-word removal is performed.",
        "Experiments are performed using a ten-fold cross validation evaluation on each dataset.Using the same unigram features, we also perform cross-topic classification, so that we can better understand the topic dependence.",
        "For this, we train the SVM classifier on training data consisting of a merge of two topics (e.g., Abortion + Best Friend) and test on the third topic (e.g., Death Penalty).",
        "The results for both within- and cross-topic are shown in the last two columns of Table 1.",
        "1 We use the SVM classifier implemented in the Weka toolkit, with its default settings.",

        "For LIWC, results are shown for within-topic experiments, with ten-fold cross validation.",
        "For unigrams, both within-topic (ten-fold cross validation on the same topic) and cross-topic (training on two topics and testing on the third topic) results are reported.",
        "Second, we use the LIWC lexicon to extract features corresponding to several word classes.",
        "LIWC was developed as a resource for psycholinguistic analysis (Pennebaker and Francis, 1999).",
        "The 2001 version of LIWC includes about 2,200 words and word stems grouped into about 70 classes relevant to psychological processes (e.g., emotion, cogni-tion), which in turn are grouped into four broad categories 2 namely: linguistic processes, psychological processes, relativity, and personal concerns.",
        "A feature is generated for each of the 70 word classes by counting the total frequency of the words belonging to that class.",
        "We perform separate evaluations using each of the four broad LIWC categories, as well as using all the categories together.",
        "The results obtained with the SVM classifier are shown in Table 1.",
        "Overall, the results show that it is possible to discriminate between deceptive and truthful cases using machine learning classifiers, with a performance superior to a random baseline which for all datasets is 50% given an even class distribution.",
        "Considering the unigram results, among the three cultures considered, the deception discrimination works best for the English-US dataset, and this is also the dataset that benefits most from the larger amount of training data brought by the cross-topic experiments.",
        "In general, the cross-topic evaluations suggest that there is no high topic dependence in this task, and that using deception data from differ-2 http://www.liwc.net/descriptiontable1.php ent topics can lead to results that are comparable to the within-topic data.",
        "Interestingly, among the three topics considered, the Best Friend topic has consistently the highest within-topic performance, which may be explained by the more personal nature of the topic, which can lead to clues that are useful for the detection of deception (e.g., references to the self or personal relationships).",
        "Regarding the LIWC classifiers, the results show that the use of the LIWC classes can lead to performance that is generally better than the one obtained with the unigram classifiers.",
        "The explicit categorization of words into psycholinguistic classes seems to be particularly useful for the languages where the words by themselves did not lead to very good classification accuracies.",
        "Among the four broad LIWC categories, the linguistic category appears to lead to the best performance as compared to the other categories.",
        "It is notable that in Spanish, the linguistic category by itself provides results that are better than when all the LIWC classes are used, which may be due to the fact that Spanish has more explicit lexicalization for clues that may be relevant to deception (e.g., verb tenses, formality).",
        "4.2 Can we use information drawn from one culture to build a deception classifier in another culture?",
        "In the next set of experiments, we explore the detection of deception using training data originating from a different culture.",

        "For consistency across the experiments, given that the size of the Spanish dataset is different compared to the other two datasets, we always train on one of the English datasets.",
        "To enable the unigram based experiments, we translate the two English datasets into Spanish by using the Bing API for automatic translation.",
        "3 As before, we extract and keep only the unigrams with frequency greater or equal to 10.",
        "The results obtained in these cross-cultural experiments are shown in the last column of Table 2.",
        "In a second set of experiments, we use the LIWC word classes as a bridge between languages.",
        "First, each deceptive or truthful statement is represented using features based on the LIWC word classes.",
        "Next, since the same word classes are used in both the English and the Spanish LIWC lexicons, this LIWC-based representation is independent of lan-guage, and therefore can be used to perform cross-cultural experiments.",
        "Table 2 shows the results obtained with each of the four broad LIWC cate-gories, as well as with all the LIWC word classes.",
        "We also attempted to combine unigrams and LIWC features.",
        "However, in most cases, no improvements were noticed with respect to the use of unigrams or LIWC features alone.",
        "We are not reporting these results due to space limitation.",
        "These cross-cultural evaluations lead to several 3 http://http://http://www.bing.com/dev/en-us/dev-center findings.",
        "First, we can use data from a culture to build deception classifiers for another culture, with performance figures better than the random baseline, but weaker than the results obtained with within-culture data.",
        "An important finding is that LIWC can be effectively used as a bridge for cross-cultural classification, with results that are comparable to the use of unigrams, which suggests that such specialized lexicons can be used for cross-cultural or cross-lingual classification.",
        "More-over, using only the linguistic category from LIWC brings additional improvements, with absolute improvements of 2-4% over the use of unigrams.",
        "This is an encouraging result, as it implies that a semantic bridge such as LIWC can be effectively used to classify deception data in other languages, instead of using the more costly and time consuming unigram method based on translations.",
        "4.3 What are the psycholinguistic classes most strongly associated with deception/truth?",
        "The final question we address is concerned with the LIWC classes that are dominant in deceptive and truthful text for different cultures.",
        "We use the method presented in (Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2009), which consists of a metric that measures the saliency of LIWC classes in deceptive versus truthful data.",
        "Following their strategy, we first create a corpus of deceptive and truthful text using a mix of all the topics in each culture.",
        "We then calculate 443 Class Score Sample words Class Score Sample words English-US Deceptive Truthful Metaph 1.77 Die,died,hell,sin,lord Insight 0.68 Accept,believe,understand Other 1.46 He,her,herself,him I 0.66 I,me,my,myself, You 1.41 Thou,you Optimism 0.65 accept, hope, top, best Othref 1.18 He,her,herself,him We 0.55 Our,ourselves,us,we, Negemo 1.18 Afraid,agony,awful,bad Friends 0.46 Buddies,friend English-India Deceptive Truthful Negate 1.49 Cannot,neither,no,none Past 0.78 Happened,helped,liked,listened Physical 1.46 Heart,ill,love,loved, I 0.66 I,me,mine,my Future 1.42 Be,may,might,will Optimism 0.65 Accept,accepts,best,bold, Other 1.17 He,she, himself,herself We 0.55 Our,ourselves,us,we Humans 1.08 Adult,baby,children,human Friends 0.46 Buddies,companion,friend,pal Spanish-Mexico Deceptive Truthful Certain 1.47 Jam?as(never),siempre(always) Optimism 0.66 Aceptar(accept),animar(cheer) Humans 1.28 Beb?e(baby),persona(person) Self 0.65 Conmigo(me),tengo(have),soy(am) You 1.26 Eres(are),estas(be),su(his/her) We 0.58 Estamos(are),somos(be),tenemos(have) Negate 1.25 Jam?as(never),tampoco(neither) Friends 0.37 Amigo/amiga(friend),amistad(friendship) Other 1.22 Es(is),esta(are),otro(other) Past 0.32 Compartimos(share),vivimos(lived) Table 3: Top ranked LIWC classes for each culture, along with sample words the dominance for each LIWC class, and rank the classes in reversed order of their dominance score.",
        "Table 3 shows the most salient classes for each culture, along with sample words.",
        "This analysis shows some interesting patterns.",
        "There are several classes that are shared among the cultures.",
        "For instance, the deceivers in all cultures make use of negation, negative emotions, and references to others.",
        "Second, true tellers use more optimism and friendship words, as well as references to themselves.",
        "These results are in line with previous research, which showed that LIWC word classes exhibit similar trends when distinguishing between deceptive and non-deceptive text (Newman et al., 2003).",
        "Moreover, there are also word classes that only appear in some of the cultures; for example, time classes (Past, Future) appear in English-India and Spanish-Mexico, but not in English-US, which in turn contains other classes such as Insight and Metaph.",
        "5 Conclusions In this paper, we addressed the task of deception detection within- and across-cultures.",
        "Using three datasets from three different cultures, each covering three different topics, we conducted several experiments to evaluate the accuracy of deception detection when learning from data from the same culture or from a different culture.",
        "In our evalua-tions, we compared the use of unigrams versus the use of psycholinguistic word classes.",
        "The main findings from these experiments are: 1) We can build deception classifiers for different cultures with accuracies ranging between 60-70%, with better performance obtained when using psycholinguistic word classes as compared to simple unigrams; 2) The deception classifiers are not sensitive to different topics, with cross-topic classification experiments leading to results comparable to the within-topic experiments; 3) We can use data originating from one culture to train deception detection classifiers for another culture; the use of psycholinguistic classes as a bridge across languages can be as effective or even more effective than the use of translated unigrams, with the added benefit of making the classification process less costly and less time consuming.",
