        "Canini et al. (2009) presented a method for LDA inference based on particle filters, where a sample set of models is updated online with each new token observed from a stream.",
        "In general, these models should be regularly resampled and rejuvenated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) steps over the history in order to improve the efficiency of the particle filter (Gilks and Berzuini, 2001).",
        "The particle filter of Canini et al. (2009) rejuvenates over independent draws from the history by storing all past observations and states.",
        "This algorithm thus has linear storage complexity and is not an online learning algorithm in a strict sense (B?orschinger and Johnson, 2012).",
        "In the current work we propose using reservoir sampling in the rejuvenation step to reduce the storage complexity of the particle filter to O(1).",
        "This improvement is practically useful in the large-data setting and is also scientifically interesting in that it recovers some of the cognitive plausibility which originally motivated B?orschinger and Johnson (2012).",

        "In each case, 2000 Gibbs sweeps are performed.",
        "In these experiments, the initial models are not held fixed; for each of the 30 runs for each dataset, the initial model was generated by a different Gibbs chain.",
        "The results for these experiments, depicted in Figure 2, indicate that the size of the initialization sample improves mean NMI and reduces variance, and that the variance of the particle filter itself is dominated by the variance of the initial model.",
        "Tuned Initialization.",
        "We observed previously that variance in the Gibbs initialization of the model contributes significantly to variance of the overall algorithm, as measured by NMI.",
        "With this in mind, we consider whether we can reduce variance in the initialization by tuning the initial model.",
        "Thus we perform a set of experiments in which we perform Gibbs initialization 20 times on the initialization set, setting the particle filter's initial model to the model out of these 20 with 449 Figure 3: Variable initialization with tuning.",
        "the highest in-sample NMI.",
        "This procedure is performed independently for each run of the particle filter.",
        "We may not always have labeled data for initialization, so we also consider a variation in which Gibbs initialization is performed 20 times on the first 80% of the initialization sample, held-out perplexity (per word) is estimated on the remaining 20%, using a first-moment particle learning approximation (Scott and Baldridge, 2013), and the particle filter is started from the model out of these 20 with the lowest held-out perplexity.",
        "The results, shown in Figure 3, show that we can ameliorate the variance due to initialization by tuning the initial model to NMI or perplexity.",
        "6 Discussion Motivated by a desire for cognitive plausibility, B?orschinger and Johnson (2011) used a particle filter to learn Bayesian word segmentation mod-els, following the work of Canini et al. (2009).",
        "They later showed that rejuvenation improved performance (B?orschinger and Johnson, 2012), but this impaired cognitive plausibility by necessitating storage of all previous states and observations.",
        "We attempted to correct this by drawing the rejuvenation sequence from a reservoir, but our results indicate that the particle filter for LDA on our dataset is highly sensitive to initialization and not influenced by rejuvenation.",
        "In the experiments of B?orschinger and Johnson (2012), the particle cloud appears to be resampled once per utterance with a large rejuvenation se-quence; 4 each particle takes many more rejuvenation MCMC steps than new state transitions and thus resembles a batch MCMC sampler.",
        "In our experiments resampling is done on the order of once per document, leading to less than one rejuvenation step per transition.",
        "Future work should carefully note this ratio: sampling history much more often than new states improves performance but contradicts the intuition behind particle filters.",
        "We have also shown that tuning the initial model using in-sample NMI or held-out perplexity can improve mean NMI and reduce variance.",
        "Perplexity (or likelihood) is often used to estimate model performance in LDA (Blei et al., 2003; Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004; Wallach et al., 2009; Hoffman et al., 2010), and does not compare the inferred model against gold-standard labels, yet it appears to be a good proxy for NMI in our experiment.",
        "Thus, if initialization continues to be crucial to performance, at least we may have the flexibility of initializing without gold-standard labels.",
        "We have focused on NMI as our evaluation metric for comparison with Canini et al. (2009).",
        "How-ever, evaluation of topic models is a subject of considerable debate (Wallach et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2009; Newman et al., 2010; Mimno et al., 2011) and it may be informative to investigate the effects of initialization and rejuvenation using other metrics such as perplexity or semantic coherence.",
        "7 Conclusion We have proposed reservoir sampling for reducing the storage complexity of a particle filter from linear to constant.",
        "This work was motivated as an expected improvement on the model of Canini et al. (2009).",
        "However, in the process of establishing an empirical baseline we discovered that rejuvenation does not play a significant role in the experiments of Canini et al. (2009).",
        "More-over, we found that performance of the particle filter was strongly affected by the random initialization of the model, and suggested a simple approach to reduce the variability therein without using additional data.",
        "In conclusion, it is now an open question whether -- and if so, under what assumptions?rejuvenation benefits particle filters for LDA and similar static Bayesian models.",
