        "( | ) ?",
        "( | ) ( | ) , (5) where ( | ) is the query expansion model, ( | ) is microblog retrieval model, and ( | ) is task identification model.",
        "In the following section, we will describe the three models in detail respectively.",
        "3.2 Query Expansion Model In fact, only using a single query is insufficient to identify the latent complex task.",
        "We thus try to extract task-coherent queries from search sessions.",
        "According to our observation, users may persistently search for the same complex task in a period of time.",
        "However, users may also simultaneously interleave search for multiple different tasks (MacKay and Watters, 2008; Liu and Bel-kin, 2010).",
        "Therefore, identifying task-coherent queries from search sessions is an important issue.",
        "We perform the following processes in order to extract task-coherent queries.",
        "Given a query log and an input query , we first separate queries in the log into search sessions with the time gap of 30 minutes.",
        "We extract search sessions containing the input query and thus obtain a set of sessions .",
        "To extract task-coherent queries from the session set , we employ log-linear model (LLM) with the following three useful features: Average Query Frequency: In most cases, the frequency of queries can reflect their importance.",
        "To avoid a long session resulting in high query frequency, we calculate the normalized query frequency as: ( ) | | ?",
        "( ) | | , (6) where ( ) is the frequency of the query in session , is the sessions containing , | | is the number of queries in session , and | | is the number of sessions containing query in the set .",
        "Session Coverage: The queries occurring in several sessions are possible candidates in terms of task-coherence.",
        "In order to favor queries occurring in many sessions, we use average session frequency, which can be calculated as follows: ( ) ( | | | | ), (7) where | | is the number of sessions containing the input query in the set , | | is the number of sessions containing query in the set , and ( ) is the exponential function.",
        "Average Query Distance: Since queries which close to the input query in a search session may have high task-coherence for the latent complex task.",
        "We thus use normal distribution to estimate the task-coherence for each query: ( ) ?",
        ", (8) where is standard deviation (is empirically set 0.2 in this work), is the average number of queries between and input query in sessions.",
        "We employ log-linear model to calculate the probability of each candidate task-coherent query based on the features described above: ( ) (?",

        "( ) | | ) .",
        "3.3 Microblog Retrieval Model Since the task names are not always observable in the expanded query set , we thus need further expanding by retrieving microblog posts.",
        "The basic idea is that a microblog post containing all queries in may also contain the task name (see the example in Table 1).",
        "In fact, the queries in the query set usually consist of a topic name and a task-intrinsic entity.",

        "(Beijing flight ticket)?",
        "contains a topic ???(Beijing)?",

        "We can thus obtain a list of task-intrinsic 472 entities ordered by the occurrence frequency of each entity.",

        "Candidate Task Name Extraction For each retrieved microblog post, we first extract all bigrams and trigrams which match the POS (part of speech) patterns listed in Table 2.",
        "According to our observation, the POS of a task topic is usually a proper noun ( ) and the POS of a task event is usually a transitive verb ( ) + common noun ( ) or an intransitive verb ( ).",
        "On the other hand, a task topic may be the most important term in related search sessions .",
        "More specifically, the term with the POS of proper noun and the highest occurrence count in the .",
        "We thus consider the term as a candidate topic (notated as <T>) and adopt two related task POS patterns, i.e., + <T> + and <T> + .",

        "Adopted POS patterns for extracting candidate task names from microblog posts.",
        "Correct Task Name Determination Different from long-text documents (e.g., webpages), microblog posts are relatively short and hard to find features based on special sections in content (e.g., anchor text, title, or blocks).",
        "Therefore, we use five efficient features proposed by Zeng et al. (2004) to extract complex task names from short-text snippets, such as microblog post or search-result snippets.",
        "The features proposed by Zeng et al. including TFIDF, phrase length, intra-cluster similarity, cluster en-tropy, and phrase independence.",
        "Furthermore, in this work, we plus two practical features task name coverage (the percentage of microblog posts containing the candidate task name) and chi-square score (Manning, 1999).",
        "Based on the set of extracted candidate task names for the input query , we also utilized LLM to select the potential task names with the highest likelihood.",

        "We group query records into sessions according to user ID.",
        "Since a complex search task may take a long time to ac-complish, we used one week as the time gap to split sessions, and finally obtained 264,360 sessions.",
