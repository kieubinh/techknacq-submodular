        "Many NLP applications, such as question answering (QA) or information extraction (IE), use type systems to represent relevant semantic classes.",
        "Types allow us to find similarities at a higher level to group lexically different entities together.",
        "This helps to filter out candidates that violate certain constraints (e.g., in QA, if the intended answer type is PERSON, we can ignore all candidate answers with a different type), but is also used for feature generation and fact-checking.",
        "A central question is: where do the types come from?",
        "Typically, they come from a hand-constructed set.",
        "This has some disadvantages.",
        "Domain-general types, such as named entities or WordNet supersenses (Fellbaum, 1998), often fail to capture critical domain-specific information (in the medical domain, we might want ANTIBI-OTIC, SEDATIVE, etc., rather than just ARTI-FACT).",
        "Domain-specific types perform much better (Ferrucci et al., 2010), but must be manually adapted to each new domain, which is expensive.",
        "Alternatively, unsupervised approaches (Ritter et al., 2010) can be used to learn clusters of similar words, but the resulting types (=cluster numbers) are not human-interpretable, which makes analysis difficult.",
        "Furthermore, it requires us to define the number of clusters beforehand.",
        "Ideally, we would like to learn domain-specific types directly from data.",
        "To this end, pattern-based approaches have long been used to induce type systems (Hearst, 1992; Kozareva et al., 2008).",
        "Recently, Hovy et al. (2011) proposed an approach that uses co-occurrence patterns to find entity type candidates, and then learns their applicability to relation arguments by using them as latent variables in a first-order HMM.",
        "However, they only evaluate their method using human sensibility judgements for one domain.",
        "While this shows that the types are coherent, it does not tell us much about their applicability.",
        "We extend their approach with three important changes: 1. we evaluate the types by measuring accuracy when using them in an extrinsic task, 2. we evaluate on more than one domain, and 3. we explore a variety of different models.",
        "We measure prediction accuracy when using the learned types in a selectional restriction task for frequent verbs.",
        "E.g., given the relation throw(X, pass) in the football domain, we compare the model prediction to the gold data X=QUARTERBACK.",
        "The results indicate that the learned types can be used to in relation extraction tasks.",
        "482 Our contributions in this paper are: ?",
        "we empirically evaluate an approach to learning types from unlabeled data ?",
        "we investigate several domains and models ?",
        "the learned entity types can be used to predict selectional restrictions with high accuracy 2 Related Work In relation extraction, we have to identify the relation elements, and then map the arguments to types.",
        "We follow an open IE approach (Banko and Etzioni, 2008) and use dependencies to identify the elements.",
        "In contrast to most previous work (Pardo et al., 2006; Yao et al., 2011; Yao et al., 2012), we have no pre-defined set of types, but try to learn it along with the relations.",
        "Some approaches use types from general data bases such as Wikipedia, Freebase, etc.",
        "(Yan et al., 2009; Eichler et al., 2008; Syed and Viegas, 2010), sidestepping the question how to construct those DBs in the first place.",
        "We are less concerned with extraction performance, but focus on the accuracy of the learned type system by measuring how well it performs in a prediction task.",
        "Talukdar et al. (2008) and Talukdar and Pereira (2010) present graph-based approaches to the similar problem of class-instance learning.",
        "While this provides a way to discover types, it requires a large graph that does not easily generalize to new instances (transductive), since it produces no predictive model.",
        "The models we use are transductive and can be applied to unseen data.",
        "Our approach follows Hovy et al. (2011).",
        "However, they only evaluate one model on football by collecting sensibility ratings from Mechanical Turk.",
        "Our method provides extrinsic measures of performance on several domains.",
        "3 Model Our goal is to find semantic type candidates in the data, and apply them in relation extraction to see which ones are best suited.",
        "We restrict ourselves to verbal relations.",
        "We build on the approach by Hovy et al. (2011), which we describe briefly below.",
        "It consists of two parts: extracting the type candidates and fitting the model.",
        "The basic idea is that semantic types are usually common nouns, often frequent ones from the y 3 y 1 y 2 x 3 x 1 Montana throw ball y 3 y 1 y 2 x 3 x 2 throw Montana ball quarterback player throw ball throw quarterback player ball a) b) Figure 1: Example of input sentence x and output types for the HMM.",
        "Note that the verb type is treated as observed variable.",
        "domain at hand.",
        "Thus all common nouns are possible types, and can be used as latent variables in an HMM.",
        "By estimating emission and transition parameters with EM, we can learn the subset of nouns to apply.",
        "However, assuming the set of all common nouns as types is intractable, and would not allow for efficient learning.",
        "To restrict the search space and improve learning, we first have to learn which types modify entities and record their co-occurrence, and use this as dictionary.",
        "Kleiman: professor:25, expert:13, (specialist:1) Tilton: executive:37, economist:17, (chairman:4, presi-dent:2) Figure 2: Examples of dictionary entries with counts.",
        "Types in brackets are not considered.",
        "Dictionary Construction The number of common nouns in a domain is generally too high to consider all of them for every entity.",
        "A common way to restrict the number of types is to provide a dictionary that lists all legal types for each entity (Merialdo, 1994; Ravi and Knight, 2009; T?ackstr?om et al., 2013).",
        "To construct this dictio-nary, we collect for each entity (i.e., a sequence of words labeled with NNP or NNPS tags) in our data all common nouns (NN, NNS) that modify it.",
        "These are 1. nominal modifiers (?judge Scalosi ...?",
        "), 2. appositions (?Tilton, a professor at ...?",
        "), and 3. copula constructions (?Finton, who is the investor ...?).",
        "These modifications can be collected from the dependency parse trees.",
        "For each entity, we store the 483 type candidates and their associated counts.",
        "See Figure 2 for examples.",
        "We only consider types observed more than 10 times.",
        "Any entity without type information, as well as dictionary entities with only singleton types are treated as unknown tokens (?UNK?).",
        "We map UNK to the 50 most common types in the dictionary.",
        "Verbs are considered to each have their own type, i.e., token and label for verbs are the same.",
        "We do not modify this step.",
        "Original Model Hovy et al. (2011) construct a HMM using subject-verb-object (SVO) parse triples as observations, and the type candidates as hidden variables.",
        "Similar models have been used in (Abney and Light, 1999; Pardo et al., 2006).",
        "We estimate the free model parameters with EM (Dempster et al., 1977), run for a fixed number of iterations (30) or until convergence.",
        "Note that Forward-backward EM has time complexity of O(N 2 T ), where N is the number of states, and T the number of time steps.",
        "T = 3 in the model formulations used here, but N is much larger than typically found in NLP tasks (see also Table 3).",
        "The only way to make this tractable is to restrict the free parameters the model needs to estimate to the transitions.",
        "The model is initialized by jointly normalizing 1 the dictionary counts to obtain the emission pa-rameters, which are then fixed (except for the unknown entities (P (word = UNK|type = ?)).",
        "Transition parameters are initialized uniformly (re- stricted to potentially observable type sequences), and kept as free parameters for the model to optimize.",
        "Common nouns can be both hidden variables and observations in the model, so they act like annotated items: their legal types are restricted to the identity.",
        "All entities are thus constrained by the dictionary, as in (Merialdo, 1994).",
        "To further constrain the model, only the top three types of each entity are considered.",
        "Since the type distribution typically follows a Zipf curve, this still captures most of the information.",
        "1 This preserves the observed entity-specific distributions.",
        "Under conditional normalization, the type candidates from frequent entities tend to dominate those of infrequent entities.",
        "I.e., the model favors an unlikely candidate for entity a if it is frequent for entity b. The model can be fully specified as P (x,y) = P (y 1 )?P (x 1 |y 1 ) 3 ?",
        "i=2 P (y i |y i?1 )?P (x i |y i ) (1) where x is an input triple of a verb and its argu-ments, and y a sequence of types.",
        "4 Extending the Model The model used by Hovy et al. (2011) was a simple first order HMM, with the elements in SVO order (see Figure 3a).",
        "We observe two points: we always deal with the same number of elements, and we have observed variables.",
        "We can thus move from a sequential model to a general graphical model by adding transitions and re-arranging the structure.",
        "Since we do not model verbs (they each have their identity as type), they act like observed variables.",
        "We can thus move them in first position and condition the subject on it (3b).",
        "y 3 y 1 y 2 OVS y 2 y 1 O V S V y 2 y 1 O S V y 2 y 1 O S a) b) c) d) Figure 3: Original SVO.",
        "model (a), modified VSO order (b), extension to general models (c and d) By adding additional transitions, we can constrain the latent variables further.",
        "This is similar to moving from a first to a second order HMM.",
        "In contrast to the original model, we also distinguish between unknown entities in the first and second argument position.",
        "The goal of these modifications is to restrict the number of potential values for the argument positions.",
        "This allows us to use the models to type individual instances.",
        "In contrast, the objective in Hovy et al. (2011) was to collect frequent relation templates from a domain to populate a knowledge base.",

        "We select instances that contain a type-candidate word in subject or object position and replace that word with the unknown token.",

        "5.1 Data Like Yao et al. (2012) and Hovy et al. (2011), we derive our data from the New York Times (NYT) corpus (Sandhaus, 2008).",
        "It contains several years worth of articles, manually annotated with meta-data such as author, content, etc.",
        "Similar to Yao et al. (2012), we use articles whose content meta-data field contains certain labels to distinguish data from different domains.",
        "We use the labels Football 2 , Law and Legislation, and Finances.",
        "We remove meta-data and lists, tokenize, parse, and lemmatize all articles.",
        "We then automatically extract subject-verb-object (SVO) triples from the parses, provided the verb is a full verb.",
        "Similarly to (Pardo et al., 2006), we focus on the top 100 full verbs for efficiency reasons, though nothing in our approach prevents us from extending it to all verbs.",
        "For each domain, we select all instances which have a potential type (common noun) in at least one argument position.",
        "These serve as corpus.",

        "As test data, we randomly select a subset of 1000 instances for each argument, provided they contain one of the 50 most frequent types in subject or object position, such as player in ?player throw pass?.",
        "This serves as gold data.",
        "We then replace those types by UNK (i.e., we get ?UNK throw pass?)",
        "and use this as test set for our model.",
        "3 Table 3 shows that the domains vary with re-2 The data likely differs from Hovy et al. (2011).",
        "3 We omit cases with two unknown arguments, since this 485 spect to the ratio of unique types to unique entities.",
        "Football uses many different entities (e.g., team and player names), but has few types (e.g., player positions), while the other domains use more types, but fewer entities (e.g., company names, law firms, etc.).",
        "5.2 Evaluation We run Viterbi decoding on each test set with our trained model to predict the most likely type for the unknown entities.",
        "We then compare these predictions to the type in the respective gold data and compute the accuracy for each argument position.",
        "As baseline, we predict the argument types most frequently observed for the particular verb in train-ing, e.g., predict PLAYER as subject of tackle in football.",
        "We evaluate the influence of the different model structures on performance.",
        "6 Results Table 1 shows the accuracy of the different models in the prediction task for the three different domains.",
        "The low results of the informed baseline indicate the task complexity.",
        "We note that the original model, a bigram HMM with SVO order (Figure 3a), fails to improve accuracy over the baseline (although its overall results were judged sensible).",
        "Changing the input order to VSO (Figure 3b) improves accuracy for both arguments over SVO order and the baseline, albeit not significantly.",
        "The first argument gains more, since conditioning the subject type on the (unam- biguous) verb is more constrained than starting out with the subject.",
        "Conditioning the object directly upon the subject creates sparser bigrams, which capture ?who does what to whom?.",
        "Moving from the HMMs to a general graphical model structure (Figures 3c and d) creates a sparser distribution and significantly improves accuracy across the board.",
        "Again, the position of the verb makes a difference: in SVO order, accuracy for the second argument is better, while in VSO order, accuracy for the subject increases.",
        "This indicates that direct conditioning on the verb is the strongest predictor.",
        "Intuitively, knowing the verb restricts the possible arguments much more than knowing the arguments restrict the possible verbs (the types of entities who can throw something are becomes almost impossible to predict without further context, even for humans (compare ?UNK make UNK?).",
        "limited, but knowing that the subject is a quarterback still allows all kinds of actions).",
        "We also compute the mean reciprocal rank (MRR) for each condition (see Table 2).",
        "MRR denotes the inverse rank in the model's k-best output at which the correct answer occurs, i.e., 1 k .",
        "The result gives us an intuition of ?how far off?",
        "the model predictions are.",
        "Across domains, the correct answer is found on average among the top two (rank 1.36).",
        "Note that since MRR require k-best outputs, we cannot compute a measure for the baseline.",
