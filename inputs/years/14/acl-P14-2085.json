      "text": [
        "In this work, we focus on the automatic prediction of whether a verb in context is used in a stative or in a dynamic sense, the most fundamental distinction in all taxonomies of aspectual class.",
        "The aspectual class of a discourse's finite verbs is an important factor in conveying and interpreting temporal structure (Moens and Steedman, 1988; Dorr, 1992; Klavans and Chodorow, 1992); others are tense, grammatical aspect, mood and whether the utterance represents an event as completed.",
        "More accurate temporal information processing is expected to be beneficial for a variety of natural language processing tasks (Costa and Branco, 2012; UzZaman et al., 2013).",
        "While most verbs have one predominant inter-pretation, others are more flexible for aspectual class and can occur as either stative (1) or dynamic (2) depending on the context.",
        "There are also cases that allow for both readings, such as (3).",
        "(1) The liquid fills the container.",
        "(stative) (2) The pool slowly filled with water.",
        "(dynamic) (3) Your soul was made to be filled with God Himself.",
        "(both) (Brown corpus, religion) Cases like (3) do not imply that there is a third class, but rather that two interpretations are available for the sentence, of which usually one will be chosen by a reader.",
        "Following Siegel and McKeown (2000), we aim to automatically classify clauses for fundamental aspectual class, a function of the main verb and a select group of complements, which may differ per verb (Siegel and McKeown, 2000; Siegel, 1998b).",
        "This corresponds to the aspectual class of the clause's main verb when ignoring any aspectual markers or transformations.",
        "For exam-ple, English sentences with perfect tense are usually considered to introduce states to the discourse (Smith, 1991; Katz, 2003), but we are interested in the aspectual class before this transformation takes place.",
        "The clause John has kissed Mary introduces a state, but the fundamental aspectual class of the ?tenseless?",
        "clause John kiss Mary is dynamic.",
        "In contrast to Siegel and McKeown (2000), we do not conduct the task of predicting aspectual class solely at the type level, as such an approach ignores the minority class of ambiguous verbs.",
        "Instead we predict the aspectual class of verbs in the context of their arguments and modifiers.",
        "We show that this method works better than using only type-based features, especially for verbs with ambiguous aspectual class.",
        "In addition, we show that type-based features, including novel distributional features based on representative verbs, accurately predict predominant aspectual class for unseen verb types.",
        "Our work differs from prior work in that we treat the problem as a three-way classification task, predicting DYNAMIC, STATIVE or BOTH as the aspectual class of a verb in context.",
        "517 2 Related work Aspectual class is well treated in the linguistic literature (Vendler, 1957; Dowty, 1979; Smith, 1991, for example).",
        "Our notion of the stative/dynamic distinction corresponds to Bach's (1986) distinction between states and non-states; to states versus occurrences (events and processes) according to Mourelatos (1978); and to Vendler's (1957) distinction between states and the other three classes (activities, achievements, accomplishments).",
        "Early studies on the computational modeling of aspectual class (Nakhimovsky, 1988; Passon-neau, 1988; Brent, 1991; Klavans and Chodorow, 1992) laid foundations for a cluster of papers published over a decade ago (Siegel and McKeown, 2000; Siegel, 1998b; Siegel, 1998a).",
        "Since then, it has mostly been treated as a subtask within temporal reasoning, such as in efforts related to TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003) and the Tem-pEval challenges (Verhagen et al., 2007; Verhagen et al., 2010; UzZaman et al., 2013), where top-performing systems (Jung and Stent, 2013; Bethard, 2013; Chambers, 2013) use corpus-based features, WordNet synsets, parse paths and features from typed dependencies to classify events as a joint task with determining the event's span.",
        "Costa and Branco (2012) explore the usefulness of a wider range of explicitly aspectual features for temporal relation classification.",
        "Siegel and McKeown (2000) present the most extensive study of predicting aspectual class, which is the main inspiration for this work.",
        "While all of their linguistically motivated features (see section 4.1) are type-based, they train on and evaluate over labeled verbs in context.",
        "Their data set taken from medical discharge summaries comprises 1500 clauses containing main verbs other than be and have which are marked for aspectual class.",
        "Their model fails to outperform a baseline of memorizing the most frequent class of a verb type, and they present an experiment testing on unseen verb types only for the related task of classifying completedness of events.",
        "We replicate their method using publicly available software, create a similar but larger corpus, 1 and show that it is indeed possible to predict the aspectual class of unseen verbs.",
        "Siegel (1998a) investigates a classification method for the verb have in context; in-1 Direct comparison on their data is not possible; feature values for the verbs studied are available, but full texts and the English Slot Grammar parser (McCord, 1990) are not.",
