        "To disambiguate a homonymous word in a given context, Lesk (1986) proposed a method that measured the degree of overlap between the glosses of the target and context words.",
        "Known as the Lesk algorithm, this simple and intuitive method has since been extensively cited and extended in the word sense disambiguation (WSD) community.",
        "Nonetheless, its performance in several WSD benchmarks is less than satisfactory (Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, 2000; Vasilescu et al., 2004).",
        "Among the popular explanations is a key limitation of the algorithm, that ?Lesk's approach is very sensitive to the exact wording of definitions, so the absence of a certain word can radically change the results.?",
        "(Navigli, 2009).",
        "Compounding this problem is the fact that many Lesk variants limited the concept of overlap to the literal interpretation of string matching (with their own variants such as length-sensitive matching (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002), etc.",
        "), and it was not until recently that overlap started to take on other forms such as tree-matching (Chen et al., 2009) and vector space models (Abdalgader and Skabar, 2012; Raviv et al., 2012; Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2006).",
        "To address this limitation, a Naive Bayes model (NBM) is proposed in this study as a novel, probabilistic treatment of overlap in gloss-based WSD.",
        "2 Related Work In the extraordinarily rich literature on WSD, we focus our review on those closest to the topic of Lesk and NBM.",
        "In particular, we opt for the ?sim- plified Lesk?",
        "(Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, 2000), where inventory senses are assessed by gloss-context overlap rather than gloss-gloss overlap.",
        "This particular variant prevents proliferation of gloss comparison on larger contexts (Mihalcea et al., 2004) and is shown to outperform the original Lesk algorithm (Vasilescu et al., 2004).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, NBMs have been employed exclusively as classifiers in WSD ?",
        "that is, in contrast to their use as a similarity measure in this study.",
        "Gale et al. (1992) used NB classifier resembling an information retrieval sys-tem: a WSD instance is regarded as a document d, and candidate senses are scored in terms of ?rel- evance?",
        "to d. When evaluated on a WSD benchmark (Vasilescu et al., 2004), the algorithm compared favourably to Lesk variants (as expected for a supervised method).",
        "Pedersen (2000) proposed an ensemble model with multiple NB classifiers differing by context window size.",
        "Hristea (2009) trained an unsupervised NB classifier using the EM algorithm and empirically demonstrated the benefits of WordNet-assisted (Fellbaum, 1998) feature selection over local syntactic features.",
        "Among Lesk variants, Banerjee and Pedersen (2002) extended the gloss of both inventory senses and the context words to include words in their related synsets in WordNet.",
        "Senses were scored by the sum of overlaps across all relation pairs, and the effect of individual relation pairs was evaluated in a later work (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003).",
        "Overlap was assessed by string matching, with the number of matching words squared so as to assign 531 higher scores to multi-word overlaps.",
        "Breaking away from string matching, Wilks et al. (1990) measured overlap as similarity between gloss- and context-vectors, which were aggregated word vectors encoding second order co-occurrence information in glosses.",
        "An extension by Patwardhan and Pedersen (2006) differentiated context word senses and extended shorter glosses with related glosses in WordNet.",
        "Patwardhan et al. (2003) measured overlap by concept similarity (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006) between each inventory sense and the context words.",
        "Gloss overlaps from their earlier work actually out-performed all five similarity-based methods.",
        "More recently, Chen et al. (2009) proposed a tree-matching algorithm that measured gloss-context overlap as the weighted sum of dependency-induced lexical distance.",
        "Abdalgader and Skabar (2012) constructed a sentential similarity measure (Li et al., 2006) using lexical similarity measures (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006), and overlap was measured by the cosine of their respective sentential vectors.",
        "A related approach (Raviv et al., 2012) also used Wikipedia-induced concepts to encoded sentential vectors.",
        "These systems compared favourably to existing methods in WSD performance, although by using sense frequency information, they are essentially supervised methods.",
        "Distributional methods have been used in many WSD systems in quite different flavours than the current study.",
        "Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig (2000) proposed a Lesk variant where each gloss word is weighted by its idf score in relation to all glosses, and gloss-context association was incremented by these weights rather than binary, overlap counts.",
        "Miller et al. (2012) used distributional thesauri as a knowledge base to increase overlaps, which were, again, assessed by string matching.",
        "In conclusion, the majority of Lesk variants focused on extending the gloss to increase the chance of overlapping, while the proposed NBM aims to make better use of the limited lexical knowledge available.",
        "In contrast to string match-ing, the probabilistic nature of our model offers a ?softer?",
        "measurement of gloss-context associa-tion, resulting in a novel approach to unsupervised WSD with state-of-the-art performance in more than one WSD benchmark (Section 4).",
        "3 Model and Task Descriptions 3.1 The Naive Bayes Model Formally, given two sets e = {e i } and f = { f j } each consisting of multiple random events, the proposed model measures the probabilistic association p(f|e) between e and f. Under the assumption of conditional independence among the events in each set, a Naive Bayes treatment of the measure can be formulated as: p(f|e) = ?",
        "j p( f j |{e i }) = ?",
        "j p({e i }| f j )p( f j ) p({e i }) = ?",
        "j [p( f j ) ?",
        "i p(e i | f j )] ?",
        "j ?",
        "i p(e i ) , (1) In the second expression, Bayes's rule is applied not only to take advantage of the conditional independence among e i ?s, but also to facilitate probability estimation, since p({e i }| f j ) is easier to estimate in the context of WSD, where sample spaces of e and f become asymmetric (Section 3.2).",
        "3.2 Model Application in WSD In the context of WSD, e can be regarded as an instance of a polysemous word w, while f represents certain lexical knowledge about the sense s of w manifested by e. 1 WSD is thus formulated as identifying the sense s ?",
        "in the sense inventory S of w s.t.",
        ": s ?",
        "= argmax s?S p(f|e) (2) In one of their simplest forms, e i 's correspond to co-occurring words in the instance of w, and f j 's consist of the gloss words of sense s. Conse-quently, p(f|e) is essentially measuring the association between context words of w and definition texts of s, i.e., the gloss-context association in the simplified Lesk algorithm (Kilgarriff and Rosen-zweig, 2000).",
        "A major difference, however, is that instead of using hard, overlap counts between the two sets of words from the gloss and the context, this probabilistic treatment can implicitly model the distributional similarity among the elements e i and f j (and consequently between the sets e and f) over a wider range of contexts.",
        "The result is a ?softer?",
        "proxy of association than the binary view of overlaps in existing Lesk variants.",
        "The foregoing discussion offers a second motivation for applying Bayes's rule on the second 1 Think of the notations e and f mnemonically as exemplars and features, respectively.",
        "532 Senses Hypernyms Hyponyms Synonyms factory building complex, complex brewery, factory, mill, ... works, industrial plant life form organism, being perennial, crop... flora, plant life Table 1: Lexical knowledge for the word plant under its two meanings factory and life form.",
        "expression in Equation (1): it is easier to estimate p(e i | f j ) than p( f j |e i ), since the vocabulary for the lexical knowledge features ( f j ) is usually more limited than that of the contexts (e i ) and hence estimation of the former suffices on a smaller amount of data than that of the latter.",
        "3.3 Incorporating Additional Lexical Knowledge The input of the proposed NBM is bags of words, and thus it is straightforward to incorporate various forms of lexical knowledge (LK) for word senses: by concatenating a tokenized knowledge source to the existing knowledge representation f, while the similarity measure remains unchanged.",
        "The availability of LK largely depends on the sense inventory used in a WSD task.",
        "WordNet senses are often used in Senseval and SemEval tasks, and hence senses (or synsets, and possibly their corresponding word forms) that are semantic related to the inventory senses under WordNet relations are easily obtainable and have been exploited by many existing studies.",
        "As pointed out by Patwardhan et al. (2003), however, ?not all of these relations are equally helpful.?",
        "Relation pairs involving hyponyms were shown to result in better F-measure when used in gloss overlaps (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003).",
        "The authors attributed the phenomenon to the the multitude of hyponyms compared to other relations.",
        "We further hypothesize that, beyond sheer numbers, synonyms and hyponyms offer stronger semantic specification that helps distinguish the senses of a given ambiguous word, and thus are more effective knowledge sources for WSD.",
        "Take the word plant for example.",
        "Selected hy-pernyms, hyponyms, and synonyms pertaining to its two senses factory and life form are listed in Table 1.",
        "Hypernyms can be overly general terms (e.g., being).",
        "Although conceptually helpful for humans in coarse-grained WSD, this generality is likely to inflate the hypernyms?",
        "probabilistic estimation.",
        "Hyponyms, on the other hand, help specify their corresponding senses with information that is possibly missing from the often overly brief glosses: the many technical terms as hyponyms in Table 1 ?",
        "though rare ?",
        "are likely to occur in the (possibly domain-specific) contexts that are highly typical of the corresponding senses.",
        "Particularly for the NBM, the co-occurrence is likely to result in stronger gloss-definition associations when similar contexts appear in a WSD instance.",
        "We also observe that some semantically related words appear under rare senses (e.g., still as an alcohol-manufacturing plant, and annual as a one-year-life-cycle plant; omitted from Table 1).",
        "This is a general phenomenon in gloss-based WSD and is beyond the scope of the current discussion.",
        "2 Overall, all three sources of LK may complement each other in WSD tasks, with hyponyms particularly promising in both quantity and quality compared to hypernyms and synonyms.",
        "3 3.4 Probability Estimation A most open-ended question is how to estimate the probabilities in Equation (1).",
        "In WSD in particu-lar, the estimation concerns the marginal and conditional probabilities of and between word tokens.",
        "Many options are available to this end in statistical machine learning (MLE, MAP, etc.",
        "), information theory (Church and Hanks, 1990; Turney, 2001), as well as the rich body of research in lexical semantic similarity Resnik, 1995; Jiang and Conrath, 1997; Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006).",
        "Here we choose maximum likelihood ?",
        "not only for its simplicity, but also to demonstrate model strength with a relatively crude probability estimation.",
        "To avoid underflow, Equation (1) is estimated as the following log probability: ?",
        "i log c( f j ) c(?)",
        "+ ?",
        "i ?",
        "j log c(e i , f j ) c( f j ) ?|f| ?",
        "j log c(e i ) c(?)",
        "=(1?|e|) ?",
        "i logc( f j )?|f| ?",
        "j logc(e i ) + ?",
        "i ?",
        "j logc(e i , f j )+ |f|(|e|?1) logc(?",
        "), where c(x) is the count of word x, c(?)",
        "is the corpus 2 We do, however, refer curious readers to the work of Raviv et al. (2012) for a novel treatment of a similar problem.",
        "3 Note that LK expansion is a feature of our model rather than a requirement.",

        "533 size, c(x,y) is the joint count of x and y, and |v| is the dimension of vector v. Nonetheless, we do investigate how model performance responds to estimation quality.",
        "Specifically in WSD, a source corpus is defined as the source of the majority of the WSD instances in a given dataset, and a baseline corpus of a smaller size and less resemblance to the instances is used for all datasets.",
        "The assumption is that a source corpus offers better estimates for the model than the baseline corpus, and difference in model performance is expected when using probability estimation of different quality.",
        "4 Evaluation 4.1 Data, Scoring, and Pre-processing Various aspects of the model discussed in Section 3 are evaluated in the English lexical sample tasks from Senseval-2 (Edmonds and Cotton, 2001) and SemEval-2007 (Pradhan et al., 2007).",
        "Training sections are used as development data and test sections held out for final testing.",
        "Model performance is evaluated in terms of WSD accuracy using Equation (2) as the scoring function.",
        "Accuracy is defined as the number of correct responses over the number of instances.",
        "Because it is a rare event for the NBM to produce identical scores, 4 the model always proposes a unique answer and accuracy is thus equivalent to F-score commonly used in existing reports.",
        "Multiword expressions (MWEs) in the Senseval-2 sense inventory are not explicitly marked in the contexts.",
        "Several of the top-ranking systems implemented their own MWE detection algorithms (Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, 2000; Litkowski, 2002).",
        "Without digressing to the details of MWE detection ?",
        "and meanwhile, to ensure fair comparison with existing systems ?",
        "we implement two variants of the prediction module, one completely ignorant of MWE and defaulting to INCORRECT for all MWE-related answers, while the other assuming perfect MWE detection and performing regular disambiguation algorithm on the MWE-related senses (not defaulting to CORRECT).",
        "All results reported for Senseval-2 below are harmonic means of the two outcomes.",
        "Each inventory sense is represented by a set of LK tokens (e.g., definition texts, synonyms, etc.)",
        "4 This has never occurred in the hundreds of thousands of runs in our development process.",

        "The MIT-JWI library (Finlayson, 2014) is used for accessing WordNet.",
        "Usage examples in glosses (included by the library by default) are removed in our experiments.",
        "5 Basic pre-processing is performed on the contexts and the glosses, including lower-casing, stop-word removal, lemmatization on both datasets, and tokenization on the Senseval-2 instances.",
        "6 Stanford CoreNLP 7 is used for lemmatization and tokenization.",
        "Identical procedures are applied to all corpora used for probability estimation.",

        "4.2 Comparing Lexical Knowledge Sources To study the effect of different types of LK in WSD (Section 3.3), for each inventory sense, we choose synonyms (syn), hypernyms (hpr), and hyponyms (hpo) as extended LK in addition to its gloss.",
        "The WSD model is evaluated with gloss-only (glo), individual extended LK sources, and the combination of all four sources (all).",
        "The results are listed in Table 2 together with existing results (1st and 2nd correspond to the results of the top two unsupervised methods in each dataset).",
        "8 By using only glosses, the proposed model already shows statistically significant improvement over the basic Lesk algorithm (92.4% and 140.5% relative improvement in Senseval-2 coarse- and fine-grained tracks, respectively).",

        "For the fine-grained track, it achieves 2nd place after that of Tugwell and Kilgarriff (2001), which used a decision list (Yarowsky, 1995) on manually selected corpora evidence for each inventory sense, and thus is not subject to loss of distinguishability in the glosses as Lesk variants are.",
        "4.3 Probability Estimation To evaluate model response to probability estimation of different quality (Section 3.4), source corpora are chosen as the majority value of the doc-source attribute of instances in each dataset, namely, the British National Corpus for Senseval-2 (94%) and the Wall Street Journal for SemEval2007 (86%).",

        "For future work, we plan to apply the model in other shared tasks, including open-text WSD, so as to compare with more recent Lesk variants.",
        "We would also like to explore how to incorporate syntactic features and employ alternative statistical methods (e.g., parametric models) to improve probability estimation and inference.",
