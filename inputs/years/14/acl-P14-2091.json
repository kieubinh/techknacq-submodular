        "Japanese to English translation is known to be one of the most difficult language pair for statistical machine translation (SMT).",
        "It has been widely believed for years that the difference of word or-ders, i.e., Japanese is an SOV language, while English is an SVO language, makes the English-to-Japanese and Japanese-to-English translation difficult.",
        "However, simple, yet powerful pre-ordering techniques have made this argument a thing of the past (Isozaki et al., 2010b; Komachi et al., 2006; Fei and Michael, 2004; Lerner and Petrov, 2013; Wu et al., 2011; Katz-Brown and Collins, 2008; Neubig et al., 2012; Hoshino et al., 2013).",
        "Pre-ordering processes the source sentence in such a way that word orders appear closer to their final positions on the target side.",
        "While many successes of English-to-Japanese translation have been reported recently, the quality improvement of Japanese-to-English translation is still small even with the help of pre-ordering (Goto et al., 2013).",
        "We found that there are two major issues that make Japanese-to-English translation difficult.",
        "One is that Japanese subject and object cannot easily be identified compared to En-glish, while their detections are the key process to generate correct English word orders.",
        "Japanese surface syntactic structures are not always corresponding to their deep structures, i.e., semantic roles.",
        "The other is that Japanese is a pro-drop language in which certain classes of pronouns may be omitted when they are pragmatically inferable.",
        "In Japanese-to-English translation, these omitted pronouns have to be generated properly.",
        "There are several researches that focused on the pre-ordering with Japanese deep syntactic analysis (Komachi et al., 2006; Hoshino et al., 2013) and zero pronoun generation (Taira et al., 2012) for Japanese-to-English translation.",
        "However, these two issues have been considered independently, while they heavily rely on one another.",
        "In this paper, we propose a simple joint inference which handles both Japanese deep structure analysis and zero pronoun generation.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that addresses these two issues at the same time.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "First, we describe why Japanese-to-English translation is difficult.",
        "Second, we show the basic idea of this work and its implementation based on pointwise probabilistic models and a global inference with an integer linear programming (ILP).",
        "Several experiments are employed to confirm that our new model can improve the Japanese to English translation quality.",
        "2 What makes Japanese-to-English translation difficult?",
        "Japanese syntactic relations between arguments and predicates are usually specified by particles.",
        "There are several types of particles, but we focus on ?",
        "(ga), ?",
        "(wo) and ?",
        "(wa) for the sake of 557 Table 1: An example of difficult sentence for parsing Sentence: ??",
        "?",
        "??",
        "?",
        "???.",
        "Gloss: today wa TOP liquor ga NOM can drink.",
        "Translation: (I) can drink liquor today.",
        "simplicity 1 .",
        "?",
        "ga is usually a subject marker.",
        "However, it becomes an object marker if the predicate has a potential voice type, which is usually translated into can, be able to, want to, or would like to.",
        "?",
        "wo is an object marker.",
        "?",
        "wa is a topic case marker.",
        "The topic can be anything that a speaker wants to talk about.",
        "It can be subject, object, location, time or any other grammatical elements.",
        "We cannot always identify Japanese subject and object only by seeing the surface case markers ga, wo and wa.",
        "Especially the topic case marker is problematic, since there is no concept of topic in English.",
        "It is necessary to get a deep interpretation of topic case markers in order to develop accurate Japanese-to-English SMT systems.",
        "Another big issue is that Japanese subject (or even an object) can be omitted when they can pragmatically be inferable from the context.",
        "Such a pronoun-dropping is not a unique phenomenon in Japanese actually.",
        "For instance, Spanish also allows to omit pronouns.",
        "However, the inflectional suffix of Spanish verbs include a hint of the person of the subject.",
        "On the other hand, inferring Japanese subjects is more difficult than Span-ish, since Japanese verbs usually do not have any grammatical cues to tell the subject type.",
        "Table 1 shows an example Japanese sentence which cannot be parsed only with the surface structure.",
        "The second token wa specifies the relation between??",
        "(today) and???",
        "(can drink).",
        "Human can easily tell that the relation of them is not a subject but an adverb (time).",
        "The topic case marker wa implies that the time when the speaker drinks liquor is the focus of this sentence.",
        "The 4th token ga indicates the relation between ??",
        "(liquor) and ???",
        "(can drink).",
        "Since the predicate has a potential voice (can drink), the ga particle should be interpreted as an object here.",
        "In 1 Other case markers are less frequent than these three markers this sentence, the subject is omitted.",
        "In general, it is unknown who speaks this sentence, but the first person is a natural interpretation in this context.",
        "Another tricky phenomenon is that detecting voice type is not always deterministic.",
        "There are several ways to generate a potential voice in Japanese, but we usually put the suffix word??",
        "(reru) or ???",
        "(rareru) after predicates.",
        "How-ever, these suffix words are also used for a passive voice.",
        "In summary, we can see that the following four factors are the potential causes that make the Japanese parsing difficult.",
        "?",
        "Japanese voice type detection is not straightforward.",
        "reru or rareru are used either for passive or potential voice.",
        "?",
        "surface case ga changes its interpretation from subject to object when the predicate has a potential voice.",
        "?",
        "topic case marker wa is used as a topic case marker which doesn't exist in English.",
        "Topic is either subject, object or any grammatical elements depending on the context.",
        "?",
        "Japanese subject is often omitted when it is inferable from the context.",
        "There is no cue to tell the subject person in verb suffix (inflec- tion) like in Spanish verbs We should note that they are not always independent issues.",
        "For instance, the deep case detection helps to tell the voice type, and vice versa.",
        "Another note is that they are unique issues observed only in Japanese-to-English translation.",
        "In English-to-Japanese translation, it is acceptable to generate Japanese sentences that do not use Japanese topic markers wa.",
        "Also, generating Japanese pronoun from English pronoun is accept-able, although it sounds redundant and unnatural for native speakers.",
        "3 A joint inference of deep case analysis and zero subject generation 3.1 Probabilistic model over predicate-argument structures Our deep parser runs on the top of a dependency parse tree.",
        "First, it extracts all predicates and their arguments from a dependency tree by using manual rules over POS tags.",
        "Since our pre-ordering system generates the final word orders from a labeled dependency tree, we formalize our deep 558 parsing task as a simple labeling problem over dependency links, where the label indicates the deep syntactic roles between head and modifier.",

        "In the next sections, we describe how these probabilities P z , P d , and P v are computed.",
        "2 Generally, an argument modifies a predicate, but in relative clauses, a predicate modifies an argument 3.1.1 Zero subject model: P z (z|p,A, S) This model estimates the syntactic zero subject 3 of the predicate p. For instance, z= Imeans that the subject of p is omitted and its type is first person.",
        "z=imperative means that we do not need to augment a subject because the predicate is imperative.",
        "z=already exists means that a subject already appears in the sentence.",
