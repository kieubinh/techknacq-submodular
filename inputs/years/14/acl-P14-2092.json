        "Current Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) approaches model the translation problem as a process of generating a derivation of atomic translation units, assuming that every unit is drawn out of the same model.",
        "The simplest of these is the phrase-based approach (Och et al., 1999; Koehn et al., 2003) which employs a global model to process any sub-strings of the input sentence.",
        "In this way, all we need is to increasingly translate a sequence of source words each time until the entire sentence is covered.",
        "Despite good results in many tasks, such a method ignores the roles of each source word and is somewhat different from the way used by translators.",
        "For exam-ple, an important-first strategy is generally adopted in human translation we translate the key ele-ments/structures (or skeleton) of the sentence first, and then translate the remaining parts.",
        "This especially makes sense for some languages, such as Chinese, where complex structures are usually involved.",
        "Note that the source-language structural information has been intensively investigated in recent studies of syntactic translation models.",
        "Some of them developed syntax-based models on complete syntactic trees with Treebank annotations (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2008), and others used source-language syntax as soft constraints (Marton and Resnik, 2008; Chiang, 2010).",
        "However, these approaches suffer from the same problem as the phrase-based counterpart and use the single global model to handle different translation units, no matter they are from the skeleton of the input tree/sentence or other not-so-important sub-structures.",
        "In this paper we instead explicitly model the translation problem with sentence skeleton information.",
        "In particular, ?",
        "We develop a skeleton-based model which divides translation into two sub-models: a skeleton translation model (i.e., translating the key elements) and a full translation model (i.e., translating the remaining source words and generating the complete translation).",
        "?",
        "We develop a skeletal language model to describe the possibility of translation skeleton and handle some of the long-distance word dependencies.",
        "?",
        "We apply the proposed model to Chinese-English phrase-based MT and demonstrate promising BLEU improvements and TER reductions on the NIST evaluation data.",
        "2 A Skeleton-based Approach to MT 2.1 Skeleton Identification The first issue that arises is how to identify the skeleton for a given source sentence.",
        "Many ways are available.",
        "E.g., we can start with a full syntactic tree and transform it into a simpler form (e.g., removing a sub-tree).",
        "Here we choose a simple and straightforward method: a skeleton is obtained by dropping all unimportant words in the original sentence, while preserving the grammaticality.",

        "Obviously the skeleton used in this work can be viewed as a simplified sentence.",
        "Thus the problem is in principle the same as sentence simpli-fication/compression.",
        "The motivations of defining the problem in this way are two-fold.",
        "First, as the skeleton is a well-formed (but simple) sen-tence, all current MT approaches are applicable to the skeleton translation problem.",
        "Second, obtaining simplified sentences by word deletion is a well-studied issue (Knight and Marcu, 2000; Clarke and Lapata, 2006; Galley and McKeown, 2007; Cohn and Lapata, 2008; Yamangil and Shieber, 2010; Yoshikawa et al., 2012).",
        "Many good sentence simpliciation/compression methods are available to our work.",
        "Due to the lack of space, we do not go deep into this problem.",
        "In Section 3.1 we describe the corpus and system employed for automatic generation of sentence skeletons.",
        "2.2 Base Model Next we describe our approach to integrating skeleton information into MT models.",
        "We start with an assumption that the 1-best skeleton is provided by the skeleton identification system.",
        "Then we define skeleton-based translation as a task of searching for the best target string ?",
        "t given the source string and its skeleton ?",
        ": ?",
        "t = argmax t P(t|?, s) (1) As is standard in SMT, we further assume that 1) the translation process can be decomposed into a derivation of phrase-pairs (for phrase-based models) or translation rules (for syntax-based models); 2) and a linear function g(?)",
        "is used to assign a model score to each derivation.",
        "Let d s,?,t (or d for short) denote a translation derivation.",

To compute g(d), we use a linear combination of a skeleton translation model g skel (d) and a full translation model g full (d): g(d) = g skel (d) + g full (d) (3) where the skeleton translation model handles the translation of the sentence skeleton, while the full translation model is the baseline model and handles the original problem of translating the whole sentence.",
        "The motivation here is straightforward: we use an additional score g skel (d) to model the problem of skeleton translation and interpolate it with the baseline model.",
        "See Figure 1 for an example of applying the above model to phrase-based MT.",
        "In the figure, each source phrase is translated into a target phrase, which is represented by linked rectangles.",
        "The skeleton translation model focuses on the translation of the sentence skeleton, i.e., the solid (red) rectangles; while the full translation model computes the model score for all those phrase-pairs, i.e., all solid and dashed rectangles.",
        "Another note on the model.",
        "Eq. (3) provides a very flexible way for model selection.",
        "While we will restrict ourself to phrase-based translation in the following description and experiments, we can choose different models/features for g skel (d) and g full (d).",
        "E.g., one may introduce syntactic features into g skel (d) due to their good ability in capturing structural information; and employ a standard phrase-based model for g full (d) in which not all segments of the sentence need to respect syntactic constraints.",
        "2.3 Model Score Computation In this work both the skeleton translation model g skel (d) and full translation model g full (d) resemble the usual forms used in phrase-based MT, i.e., the model score is computed by a linear combination of a group of phrase-based features and language models.",

        "In spite of their good ideas of using skeleton skeleton information, they did not model the skeleton-based translation problem in modern SMT pipelines.",
        "Our work is a further step towards the use of sentence skeleton in MT.",
        "More importantly, we develop a complete approach to this issue and show its effectiveness in a state-of-the-art MT system.",
        "5 Conclusion and Future Work We have presented a simple but effective approach to integrating the sentence skeleton information into a phrase-based system.",
        "The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves very promising BLEU improvements and TER reductions on the NIST evaluation data.",
        "In our future work we plan to investigate methods of integrating both syntactic models (for skeleton trans-lation) and phrasal models (for full translation) in our system.",
        "We also plan to study sophisticated reordering models for skeleton translation, rather than reusing the baseline reordering model which is learned on the full sentences.",
