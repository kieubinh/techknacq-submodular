        "Quality feedback from language tutors can help English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) students improve their writing skills.",
        "One of the tu-tors?",
        "tasks is to isolate writing mistakes within sentences, and point out (1) why each case is considered a mistake, and (2) how each mistake should be corrected.",
        "Because this is time consum-ing, tutors often just rewrite the sentences without giving any explanations (Fregeau, 1999).",
        "Due to the effort involved in comparing revisions with the original texts, students often fail to learn from these revisions (Williams, 2003).",
        "Computer aided language learning tools offer a solution for providing more detailed feedback.",
        "Programs can be developed to compare the stu-dent's original sentences with the tutor-revised sentences.",
        "Swanson and Yamangil (2012) have proposed a promising framework for this purpose.",
        "Their approach has two components: one to detect individual corrections within a revision, which they termed correction detection; another to determine what the correction fixes, which they termed error type selection.",
        "Although they reported a high accuracy for the error type selection classifier alone, the bottleneck of their system is the other component ?",
        "correction detection.",
        "An analysis of their system shows that approximately 70% of the system's mistakes are caused by mis-detections in the first place.",
        "Their correction detection algorithm relies on a set of heuristics developed from one single data collection (the FCE corpus (Yannakoudakis et al., 2011)).",
        "When determining whether a set of basic-edits (word insertions, dele-tions, substitutions) contributes to the same cor-rection, these heuristics lack the flexibility to adapt to a specific context.",
        "Furthermore, it is not clear if the heuristics will work as well for tutors trained to mark up revisions under different guidelines.",
        "We propose to improve upon the correction detection component by training a classifier that determines which edits in a revised sentence address the same error in the original sentence.",
        "The classifier can make more accurate decisions adjusted to contexts.",
        "Because the classifier were trained on revisions where corrections are explicitly marked by English experts, it is also possible to build systems adjusted to different annotation standards.",
        "The contributions of this paper are: (1) We show empirically that a major challenge in correction detection is to determine the number of edits that address the same error.",
        "(2) We have developed a merging model that reduces mis-detection by 1/3, leading to significant improvement in the accuracies of combined correction detection and error type selection.",
        "(3) We have conducted experiments across multiple corpora, indicating that the proposed merging model is generalizable.",
        "2 Correction Detection Comparing a student-written sentence with its re-vision, we observe that each correction can be decomposed into a set of more basic edits such as word insertions, word deletions and word substitutions.",
        "In the example shown in Figure 1, the correction ?to change ?",
        "changing?",
        "is composed of a deletion of to and a substitution from change 599 Figure 1: Detecting corrections from revisions.",
        "Our system detects individual corrections by comparing the original sentence with its revision, so that each correction addresses one error.",
        "Each polygon corresponds to one correction; the labels are codes of the error types.",
        "The codes follow the annotation standard in FCE corpus (Nicholls, 2003).",
        "In this example, W is incorrect Word order; UT is Unnecessary preposiTion; FV is wrong Verb Form; RN is Nnoun needs to be Replaced; ID is IDiom error.",
        "Figure 2: A portion of the example from Figure 1 undergoing the two-step correction detection process.",
        "The basic edits are indicated by black polygons.",
        "The corrections are shown in red polygons.",
        "(a) (b) Figure 3: Basic edits extracted by the edit-distance algorithm (Levenshtein, 1966) do not necessarily match our linguistic intuition.",
        "The ideal basic-edits are shown in Figure 3a, but since the algorithm only cares about minimizing the number of edits, it may end up extracting basic-edits shown in Figure 3b.",
        "to changing; the correction ?moment ?",
        "minute?",
        "is itself a single word substitution.",
        "Thus, we can build systems to detect corrections which operates in two steps: (1) detecting the basic edits that took place during the revision, and (2) merging those basic edits that address the same error.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates the process for a fragment of the example sentence from Figure 1.",
        "In practice, however, this two-step approach may result in mis-detections due to ambiguities.",
        "Mis-detections may be introduced from either steps.",
        "While detecting basic edits, Figures 3 gives an example of problems that might arise.",
        "Because the Levenshtein algorithm only tries to minimize the number of edits, it does not care whether the edits make any linguistic sense.",
        "For merging basic edits, Swanson and Yamangil applied a distance heuristic ?",
        "basic-edits that are close to each other (e.g. basic edits with at most one word lying in between) are merged.",
        "Figure 4 shows cases for which the heuristic results in the wrong scope.",
        "These errors caused their system to mis-detect 30% of the corrections.",
        "Since mis-detected corrections cannot be analyzed down the pipeline, (a) The basic edits are addressing the same problem.",
        "But these basic edits are non-adjacent, and therefore not merged by S&Y's algorithm.",
        "(b) The basic edits in the above two cases address different problems though they are adjacent.",
        "S&Y's merging algorithm incorrectly merges them.",
        "Figure 4: Merging mistakes by the algorithm proposed in Swanson and Yamangil (2012) (S&Y), which merges adjacent basic edits.",
        "the correction detection component became the bottle-neck of their overall system.",
        "Out of the 42% corrections that are incorrectly analyzed 1 , 30%/42%?70% are caused by mis-detections in the first place.",
        "An improvement in correction detection may increase the system accuracy overall.",
        "We conducted an error analysis to attribute errors to either step when the system detects a wrong set of corrections for a sentence.",
        "We examine the first step's output.",
        "If the resulting basic edits do not match with those that compose the actual corrections, we attribute the error to the first step.",
        "Otherwise, we attribute the error to the second step.",
        "Our analysis confirms that the merging step is the bottleneck in the current correction detection system ?",
        "it accounts for 75% of the mis-detections.",
        "Therefore, to effectively reduce the algorithm's mis-detection errors, we propose to 1 Swanson and Yamangil reported an overall system with 58% F-score.",
        "600 build a classifier to merge with better accuracies.",
        "Other previous tasks also involve comparing two sentences.",
        "Unlike evaluating grammar error correction systems (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012), correction detection cannot refer to a gold standard.",
        "Our error analysis above also highlights our task's difference with previous work that identify corresponding phrases between two sentences, including phrase extraction (Koehn et al., 2003) and paraphrase extraction (Cohn et al., 2008).",
        "They are fundamentally different in that the granularity of the extracted phrase pairs is a major concern in our work ?",
        "we need to guarantee each detected phrase pair to address exactly one writing problem.",
        "In comparison, phrase extraction systems aim to improve the end-to-end MT or paraphrasing systems.",
        "A bigger concern is to guarantee the extracted phrase pairs are indeed translations or paraphrases.",
        "Recent work therefore focuses on identifying the alignment/edits between two sentences (Snover et al., 2009; Heilman and Smith, 2010).",
        "3 A Classifier for Merging Basic-Edits Figures 4 highlights the problems with indiscrimi-nantly merging basic-edits that are adjacent.",
        "Intu-itively, it seems that the decision should be more context dependent.",
        "Certain patterns may indicate that two adjacent basic-edits are a part of the same correction while others may indicate that they each address a different problem.",
        "For example, in Figure 5a, when the insertion of one word is followed by the deletion of the same word, the insertion and deletion are likely addressing one single error.",
        "This is because these two edits would combine together as a word-order change.",
        "On the other hand, in Figure 5b, if one edit includes a substitution between words with the same POS?s, then it is likely fixing a word choice error by itself.",
        "In this case, it should not be merged with other edits.",
        "To predict whether two basic-edits address the same writing problem more discriminatively, we train a Maximum Entropy binary classifier based on features extracted from relevant contexts for the basic edits.",
        "We use features in Table 1 in the proposed classifier.",
        "We design the features to in-dicate: (A) whether merging the two basic-edits matches the pattern for a common correction.",
        "(B) whether one basic-edit addresses one single error.",

        "Our goal is to train classifiers to tell if two basic edits should be merged (True or False).",

        "edits that compose each correction.",
        "We then create a training instance for each pair of two consecutive basic edits: if two consecutive basic edits need to be merged, we will mark the outcome as True, otherwise it is False.",
        "We illustrate this in Figure 6.",
        "4 Experimental Setup We combine Levenshtein algorithm with different merging algorithms for correction detection.",
        "4.1 Dataset An ideal data resource would be a real-world collection of student essays and their revisions (Tajiri et al., 2012).",
        "However, existing revision corpora do not have the fine-grained annotations necessary for our experimental gold standard.",
        "We instead use error annotated data, in which the corrections were provided by human experts.",
        "We simulate the revisions by applying corrections onto the original sentence.",
        "The teachers?",
        "annotations are treated as gold standard for the detailed corrections.",
        "We considered four corpora with different ESL populations and annotation standards, including FCE corpus (Yannakoudakis et al., 2011), NUCLE corpus (Dahlmeier et al., 2013), UIUC corpus 2 (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010) and HOO2011 corpus (Dale and Kilgarriff, 2011).",
