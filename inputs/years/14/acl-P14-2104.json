        "Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is the task of automatically annotating the predicate-argument structure in a sentence with semantic roles.",
        "Ever since Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), SRL has become an important technology used in applications requiring semantic interpretation, ranging from information extraction (Frank et al., 2007) and question answering (Narayanan and Harabagiu, 2004), to practical problems including textual entailment (Burchardt et al., 2007) and pictorial communication systems (Goldberg et al., 2008).",
        "SRL systems in many languages have been developed as the necessary linguistic resources become available (Taul?e et al., 2008; Xue and Palmer, 2009; B?ohmov?a et al., 2003; Kawahara et al., 2002).",
        "Seven languages were the subject of the CoNLL-2009 shared task in syntactic and semantic parsing (Haji?c et al., 2009).",
        "These languages can be categorized into three broad morphological types: fusional (4), analytic (2), and one agglutinative language.",
        "Paul studies mathematics with Jane at a library Poleun doseogwaneseo Jeingwa suhageull gongbuhanda Figure 1: English (SVO) and Korean (SOV) words alignment.",
        "The subject, verb, and object are highlighted as red, blue, and green, respectively.",
        "Also, prepositions and suffixes are highlighted as purple.",
        "Bj?orkelund et al. (2009) report an average labeled semantic F1-score of 80.80% across these languages.",
        "The highest performance was achieved for the analytic language group (82.12%), while the agglutinative language, Japanese, yielded the lowest performance (76.30%).",
        "Agglutinative languages such as Japanese, Korean, and Turkish are computationally difficult due to word-form spar-sity, variable word order, and the challenge of using rich morphological features.",
        "In this paper, we describe a Korean SRL system which achieves 81% labeled semantic F1-score.",
        "As far as we know, this is the highest accuracy obtained for Korean, as well as any agglutinative language.",
        "Figure 1 displays a English/Korean sentence pair, highlighting the SOV word order of Korean as well as its rich morphological structure.",
        "Two factors proved crucial in the performance of our SRL system: (i) The analysis of fine-grained morphological tags specific to Korean, and (ii) the use of latent stem and morpheme representations to deal with sparsity.",
        "We incorporated both of these elements in a CRF (Lafferty et al., 2001) role labeling model.",
        "Besides the contribution of this model and SRL system, we also report on the creation and availability of a new semantically annotated Korean corpus, covering over 8,000 sentences.",
        "We used this corpus to develop, train, and test our Korean SRL model.",
        "In the next section, we describe the process of corpus creation in more detail.",
        "637 2 A Semantically Annotated Korean Corpus We annotated predicate-argument structure of verbs in a corpus from the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute of Korea (ETRI).",
        "1 Our corpus was developed over two years using a specialized annotation tool (Song et al., 2012), resulting in more than 8,000 semantically annotated sentences.",
        "As much as possible, annotations followed the PropBank guidelines for English (Bonial et al., 2010).",
        "We view our work as building on the efforts of the Penn Korean PropBank (PKPB).",
        "2 Our corpus is roughly similar in size to the PKPB, and taken together, the two Korean corpora now total about half the size of the Penn English PropBank.",
        "One advantage of our corpus is that it is built on top of the ETRI Korean corpus, which uses a richer Korean morphological tagging scheme than the Penn Korean Treebank.",
        "Our experiments will show that these finer-grained tags are crucial for achieving high SRL accuracy.",
        "All annotations were performed by two people working in a team.",
        "At first, each annotator assigns semantic roles independently and then they discuss to reduce disagreement of their annotation results.",
        "Initially, the disagreement rate between two annotators was about 14%.",
        "After 4 months of this process, the disagreement rate fell to 4% through the process of building annotation rules for Korean.",
        "The underlying ETRI syntactically-annotated corpus contains the dependency tree structure of sentences with morpho-syntactic tags.",
        "It includes 101,602 multiple-clause sentences with 21.66 words on average.",
        "We encountered two major difficulties during annotation.",
        "First, the existing Korean frame files from the Penn Korean PropBank include 2,749 verbs, covering only 13.87% of all the verbs in the ETRI corpus.",
        "Secondly, no Korean PropBanking guidelines have previously been published, leading to uncertainty in the initial stages of annotation.",
        "These uncertainties were gradually resolved through the iterative process of resolving inter-annotator disagreements.",
        "Table 1 shows the semantic roles considered in our annotated corpus.",
        "Although these are based on the general English PropBank guidelines (Bonial et al., 2010), they also differ in that we used only 1 http://voice.etri.re.kr/db/db pop.asp?code=88 2 http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006T03 Roles Definition Rate ARG0 Agent 10.02% ARG1 Patient 26.73% ARG2 Start point / Benefactive 5.18% ARG3 Ending point 1.10% ARGM-ADV Adverbial 1.26% ARGM-CAU Cause 1.17% ARGM-CND Condition 0.36% ARGM-DIR Direction 0.35% ARGM-DIS Discourse 28.71% ARGM-EXT Extent 4.50% ARGM-INS Instrument 1.04% ARGM-LOC Locative 4.51% ARGM-MNR Manner 8.72% ARGM-NEG Negation 0.26% ARGM-PRD Predication 0.27% ARGM-PRP Purpose 0.77% ARGM-TMP Temporal 5.05% Table 1: Semantic roles in our annotated corpus.",
        "4 numbered arguments from ARG0 to ARG3 instead of 5 numbered arguments.",
        "We thus consider 17 semantic roles in total.",
        "Four of them are numbered roles, describing the essential arguments of a predicate.",
        "The other roles are called modifier roles that play more of an adjunct role.",
        "We have annotated semantic roles by following the PropBank annotation guideline (Bonial et al., 2010) and by using frame files of the Penn Korean PropBank built by Palmer et al. (2006).",
        "The PropBank and our corpus are not exactly compatible, because the former is built on constituency-based parse trees, whereas our corpus uses dependency parses.",
        "More importantly, the tagsets of these corpora are not fully compatible.",
        "The PKPB uses much coarser morpho-syntactic tags than the ETRI corpus.",
        "For example, the PCA tag in PKPB used for a case suffix covers four different functioning tags used in our corpus.",
        "Using coarser suffix tags can seriously degrade SRL performance, as we show in Section 6, where we compare the performance of our model on both the new corpus and the older PKPB.",
        "638 3 Previous Work Korean SRL research has been limited to domestically published Korean research on small corpora.",
        "Therefore, the most direct precedent to the present work is a section in Bj?orkelund et al. (2009) on Japanese SRL.",
        "They build a classifier consisting of 3 stages: predicate disambiguation, argument identification, and argument classification.",
        "They use an L 2 -regularized linear logistic regression model cascaded through these three stages, achieving F1-score of 80.80% on average for 7 languages (Catalan, Chinese, Czech, English, German, Japanese and Spanish).",
        "The lowest reported performance is for Japanese, the only agglutinative language in their data set, achieving F1-score of 76.30%.",
        "This result showcases the computational difficulty of dealing with morphologically rich agglutinative languages.",
        "As we discuss in Section 5, we utilize these same features, but also add a set of Korean-specific features to capture aspects of Korean morphology.",
        "Besides these morphological features, we also employ latent continuous and discrete morpheme representations induced from a larger body of unannotated Korean text.",
        "As our experiments below show, these features improve performance by dealing with sparsity issues.",
        "Such features have been useful in a variety of English NLP mod-els, including chunking, named entity recognition (Turian et al., 2010), and spoken language understanding (Anastasakos et al., 2014).",
        "Unlike the English models, we use individual morphemes as our unit of analysis.",

        "m f m (y i?1 , y i , x, i), where f m (y i?1 , y i , x, i) are the feature functions.",
        "These feature functions include transition features that identify the tag bigram (y i?1 , y i ), and emission features that combine the current semantic tag (y i ) with instantiated feature templates extracted from the sentence x and its underlying morphological and dependency analysis.",
        "The function Z is the normalizing function, which ensures that p(y|x) is a valid probability distribution.",
        "We used 100 iteration of averaged perceptron algorithm to train the CRF.",
        "5 Features We detail the feature templates used for our experiments in Table 2.",
        "These features are categorized as either general features, Korean-specific features, or latent morpheme representation features.",
        "Korean-specific features are built upon the morphological analysis of the suffix agglutination of the current word x i .",
        "Korean suffixes are traditionally classified into two groups called Josa and Eomi.",
        "Josa is used to define nominal cases and modify other phrases, while Eomi is an ending of a verb or an adjective to define a tense, show an attitude, and connect or terminate a sentence.",
        "Thus, the Eomi and Josa categorization plays an important role in signaling semantic roles.",
        "Considering the functions of Josa and Eomi, we expect that numbered roles are relevant to Josa while modifier roles are more closely related to Eomi.",
        "The one exception is adverbial Josa, making the attached phrase an adverb that modifies a verb predicate.",
        "For all feature templates, ?A-?",
        "or ?P-?",
        "are used respectively to signify that the feature corresponds to the argument in question (x i ), or rather is derived from the verbal predicate that the argument depends on.",
        "General features: We use and modify 18 features used for Japanese from the prior work of Bj?orkelund et al. (2009), excluding SENSE, PO-SITION, and re-ranker features.",
