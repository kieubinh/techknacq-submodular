        "Open-domain question answering (QA) is an important and yet challenging problem that remains largely unsolved.",
        "In this paper, we focus on answering single-relation factual questions, which are the most common type of question observed in various community QA sites (Fader et al., 2013), as well as in search query logs.",
        "We assumed such questions are answerable by issuing a single-relation query that consists of the relation and an argument entity, against a knowledge base (KB).",
        "Example questions of this type include: ?Who is the CEO of Tesla??",
        "and ?Who founded Paypal??",
        "While single-relation questions are easier to handle than questions with more complex and multiple relations, such as ?When was the child of the former Secretary of State in Obama's administration born?",
        "?, single-relation questions are still far from completely solved.",
        "Even in this restricted domain there are a large number of paraphrases of the same question.",
        "That is to say that the problem of mapping from a question to a particular relation and entity in the KB is non-trivial.",
        "In this paper, we propose a semantic parsing framework tailored to single-relation questions.",
        "At the core of our approach is a novel semantic similarity model using convolutional neural networks.",
        "Leveraging the question paraphrase data mined from the WikiAnswers corpus by Fader et al. (2013), we train two semantic similarity mod-els: one links a mention from the question to an entity in the KB and the other maps a relation pattern to a relation.",
        "The answer to the question can thus be derived by finding the relation?entity triple r(e 1 , e 2 ) in the KB and returning the entity not mentioned in the question.",
        "By using a general semantic similarity model to match patterns and re-lations, as well as mentions and entities, our system outperforms the existing rule learning system, PARALEX (Fader et al., 2013), with higher precision at all the recall points when answering the questions in the same test set.",
        "The highest achievable F 1 score of our system is 0.61, versus 0.54 of PARALEX.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "We first survey related work in Sec.",

        "2 Related Work Semantic parsing of questions, which maps natural language questions to database queries, is a critical component for KB-supported QA.",
        "An early example of this research is the semantic parser for answering geography-related questions, learned using inductive logic programming (Zelle and Mooney, 1996).",
        "Research in this line originally used small, domain-specific databases, such as GeoQuery (Tang and Mooney, 2001; Liang et 643 al., 2013).",
        "Very recently, researchers have started developing semantic parsers for large, general-domain knowledge bases like Freebase and DB-pedia (Cai and Yates, 2013; Berant et al., 2013; Kwiatkowski et al., 2013).",
        "Despite significant progress, the problem remains challenging.",
        "Most methods have not yet been scaled to large KBs that can support general open-domain QA.",
        "In con-trast, Fader et al. (2013) proposed the PARALEX system, which targets answering single-relation questions using an automatically created knowledge base, ReVerb (Fader et al., 2011).",
        "By applying simple seed templates to the KB and by leveraging community-authored paraphrases of questions from WikiAnswers, they successfully demonstrated a high-quality lexicon of pattern-matching rules can be learned for this restricted form of semantic parsing.",
        "The other line of work related to our approach is continuous representations for semantic simi-larity, which has a long history and is still an active research topic.",
        "In information retrieval, TF-IDF vectors (Salton and McGill, 1983), latent semantic analysis (Deerwester et al., 1990) and topic models (Blei et al., 2003) take the bag-of-words approach, which captures well the contextual information for documents, but is often too coarse-grained to be effective for sentences.",
        "In a separate line of research, deep learning based techniques have been proposed for semantic understanding (Mesnil et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2014b; Salakhutdinov and Hin-ton, 2009; Tur et al., 2012).",
        "We adapt the work of (Huang et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2014b) for measuring the semantic distance between a question and relational triples in the KB as the core component of our semantic parsing approach.",
        "3 Problem Definition & Approach In this paper, we focus on using a knowledge base to answer single-relation questions.",
        "A single-relation question is defined as a question composed of an entity mention and a binary relation description, where the answer to this question would be an entity that has the relation with the given entity.",
        "An example of a single-relation question is ?When were DVD players invented??",
        "The entity is dvd-player and the relation is be-invent-in.",
        "The answer can thus be described as the following lambda expression: ?x.",
        "be-invent-in(dvd-player, x) Q?",
        "RP ?M (1) RP ?",
        "when were X invented (2) M ?",
        "dvd players (3) when were X invented ?",
        "be-invent-in (4) dvd players ?",
        "dvd-player (5) Figure 1: A potential semantic parse of the question ?When were DVD players invented??",
        "A knowledge base in this work can be simply viewed as a collection of binary relation instances in the form of r(e 1 , e 2 ), where r is the relation and e 1 and e 2 are the first and second entity arguments.",
        "Single-relation questions are perhaps the easiest form of questions that can directly be answered by a knowledge base.",
        "If the mapping of the relation and entity in the question can be correctly resolved, then the answer can be derived by a simple table lookup, assuming that the fact exists in the KB.",
        "However, due to the large number of paraphrases of the same question, identifying the mapping accurately remains a difficult problem.",
        "Our approach in this work can be viewed as a simple semantic parser tailored to single-relation questions, powered by advanced semantic similarity models to handle the paraphrase issue.",
        "Given a question, we first separate it into two disjoint parts: the entity mention and the relation pattern.",
        "The entity mention is a subsequence of consecutive words in the question, where the relation pattern is the question where the mention is substituted by a special symbol.",
        "The mapping between the pattern and the relation in the KB, as well as the mapping between the mention and the entity are determined by corresponding semantic similarity models.",
        "The high-level approach can be viewed as a very simple context-free grammar, which is shown in Figure 1.",
        "The probability of the rule in (1) is 1 since we assume the input is a single-relation question.",
        "For the exact decomposition of the question (e.g., (2), (3)), we simply enumerate all combinations and assign equal probabilities to them.",
        "The performance of this approach depends mainly on whether the relation pattern and entity mention can be resolved correctly (e.g., (4), (5)).",

        "4 Convolutional Neural Network based Semantic Model Following (Collobert et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2014b), we develop a new convolutional neural network (CNN) based semantic model (CNNSM) for semantic parsing.",
        "The CNNSM first uses a convolutional layer to project each word within a context window to a local contextual feature vec-tor, so that semantically similar word-n-grams are projected to vectors that are close to each other in the contextual feature space.",
        "Further, since the overall meaning of a sentence is often determined by a few key words in the sentence, CNNSM uses a max pooling layer to extract the most salient local features to form a fixed-length global feature vector.",
        "The global feature vector can be then fed to feed-forward neural network layers to extract non-linear semantic features.",
        "The architecture of the CNNSM is illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "In what fol-lows, we describe each layer of the CNNSM in detail, using the annotation illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "In our model, we leverage the word hashing technique proposed in (Huang et al., 2013) where we first represent a word by a letter-trigram count vector.",
        "For example, given a word (e.g., cat), after adding word boundary symbols (e.g., #cat#), the word is segmented into a sequence of letter-n-grams (e.g., letter-trigrams: #- c-a, c-a-t, a-t-#).",
        "Then, the word is represented as a count vector of letter-trigrams.",
        "For exam-ple, the letter-trigram representation of ?cat?",
        "is: In Figure 2, the word hashing matrix W f denotes the transformation from a word to its letter-trigram count vector, which requires no learning.",
        "Word hashing not only makes the learning more scalable by controlling the size of the vocabulary, but also can effectively handle the OOV issues, sometimes due to spelling mistakes.",
        "Given the letter-trigram based word representation, we represent a word-n-gram by concatenating the letter-trigram vectors of each word, e.g., for the t-th word-n-gram at the word-n-gram layer, we have: l t = [ f T t?d , ?",

        "The convolution operation can be viewed as sliding window based feature extraction.",
        "It captures the word-n-gram contextual features.",
        "Consider the t-th word-n-gram, the convolution matrix projects its letter-trigram representation vector l t to a contextual feature vector h t .",

        "?",
        ", T where W c is the feature transformation matrix, as known as the convolution matrix, which are shared among all word n-grams.",
        "The output of the convolutional layer is a sequence of local contextual feature vectors, one for each word (within a contextual window).",
        "Since many words do not have significant influence on the semantics of the sen-tence, we want to retain in the global feature vector only the salient features from a few key words.",
        "For this purpose, we use a max operation, also known as max pooling, to force the network to retain only 645 the most useful local features produced by the convolutional layers.",

        "v), where v is the global feature vector after max pooling, W s is the semantic projection matrix, and y is the vector representation of the input query (or document) in latent semantic space.",
        "Given a pattern and a relation, we compute their relevance score by measuring the cosine similarity between their semantic vectors.",
        "The semantic relevance score between a pattern Q and a relation R is defined as the cosine score of their semantic vectors y Q and y R .",
        "We train two CNN semantic models from sets of pattern?relation and mention?entity pairs, respectively.",
        "Following (Huang et al., 2013), for every pattern, the corresponding relation is treated as a positive example and 100 randomly selected other relations are used as negative examples.",
        "The setting for the mention?entity model is similar.",

        "5 Experiments In order to provide a fair comparison to previous work, we experimented with our approach using the PARALAX dataset (Fader et al., 2013), which consists of paraphrases of questions mined from WikiAnswers and answer triples from Re-Verb.",
        "In this section, we briefly introduce the dataset, describe the system training and evaluation processes and, finally, present our experimental results.",
        "5.1 Data & Model Training The PARALEX training data consists of approximately 1.8 million pairs of questions and single-relation database queries, such as ?When were DVD players invented?",
        "?, paired with be-invent-in(dvd-player,?).",
        "For eval-uation, the authors further sampled 698 questions that belong to 37 clusters and hand labeled the answer triples returned by their systems.",
        "To train our two CNN semantic models, we derived two parallel corpora based on the PARALEX training data.",
        "For relation patterns, we first scanned the original training corpus to see if there was an exact surface form match of the entity (e.g., dvd-player would map to ?DVD player?",
        "in the question).",
        "If an exact match was found, then the pattern would be derived by replacing the mention in the question with the special symbol.",
        "The corresponding relation of this pattern was thus the relation used in the original database query, along with the variable argument position (i.e., 1 or 2, indicating whether the answer entity was the first or second argument of the relation).",
        "In the end, we derived about 1.2 million pairs of patterns and relations.",
        "We then applied these patterns to all the 1.8 million training questions, which helped discover 160 thousand new mentions that did not have the exact surface form matches to the entities.",
        "When training the CNNSM for the pattern?",
        "relation similarity measure, we randomly split the 1.2 million pairs of patterns and relations into two sets: the training set of 1.19 million pairs, and the validation set of 12 thousand pairs for hyper-parameter tuning.",
        "Data were tokenized by replacing hyphens with blank spaces.",
        "In the ex-periment, we used a context window (i.e., the receptive field) of three words in the convolutional neural networks.",
        "There were 15 thousand unique letter-trigrams observed in the training set (used for word hashing).",
        "Five hundred neurons were used in the convolutional layer, the max-pooling layer and the final semantic layer, respectively.",

        "6 Conclusions In this work, we propose a semantic parsing framework for single-relation questions.",

        "Our similarity model is trained using convolutional neural networks with letter-trigrams vectors.",
        "This design helps the model go beyond bag-of-words representations and handles the OOV issue.",
        "Our method achieves higher precision on the QA task than the previous work, PARALEX, consistently at different recall points.",
        "Despite the strong empirical performance, our system has room for improvement.",
        "For in-stance, due to the variety of entity mentions in the real world, the parallel corpus derived from the WikiAnswers data and ReVerb KB may not contain enough data to train a robust entity linking model.",
        "Replacing this component with a dedicated entity linking system could improve the performance and also reduce the number of pattern/mention candidates when processing each question.",
        "In the future, we would like to extend our method to other more structured KBs, such as Freebase, and to explore approaches to extend our system to handle multi-relation questions.",
