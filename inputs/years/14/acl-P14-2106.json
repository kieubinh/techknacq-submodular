(2008) trained two state-of-the-art constituency-based statistical parsers (Charniak, 649 2000; Bikel, 2004) on semantically-enriched in-put, substituting content words with their semantic classes, trying to overcome the limitations of lexicalized approaches to parsing (Collins, 2003) where related words, like scissors and knife, cannot be generalized.",
        "The results showed a signi-cant improvement, giving the first results over both WordNet and the Penn Treebank (PTB) to show that semantics helps parsing.",
        "Later, Agirre et al. (2011) successfully introduced WordNet classes in a dependency parser, obtaining improvements on the full PTB using gold POS tags, trying different combinations of semantic classes.",
        "MacKinlay et al. (2012) investigate the addition of semantic annotations in the form of word sense hypernyms, in HPSG parse ranking, reducing error rate in dependency F-score by 1%, while some methods produce substantial decreases in performance.",
        "Fujita et al. (2010) showed that fully disambiguated sense-based features smoothed using ontological information are effective for parse selection.",
        "On the second group, Koo et al. (2008) presented a semisupervised method for training dependency parsers, introducing features that incorporate word clusters automatically acquired from a large unannotated corpus.",
        "The clusters include strongly semantic associations like {apple, pear} or {Apple, IBM} and also syntactic clusters like {of, in}.",

        "Recently, T?ackstr?om et al. (2012) tested the incorporation of cluster features from unlabeled corpora in a multilingual setting, giving an algorithm for inducing cross-lingual clusters.",
        "3 Experimental Framework In this section we will briefly describe the PTB-based datasets (subsection 3.1), followed by the data-driven parsers used for the experiments (sub- section 3.2).",
        "Finally, we will describe the different types of semantic representation that were used.",
        "3.1 Treebank conversions Penn2Malt 1 performs a simple and direct conversion from the constituency-based PTB to a dependency treebank.",
        "It obtains projective trees and has been used in several works, which allows us to 1 http://w3.msi.vxu.se/ nivre/research/Penn2Malt.html compare our results with related experiments (Koo et al., 2008; Suzuki et al., 2009; Koo and Collins, 2010).",

        "We added two features that inspect the semantic feature at the top of the stack and the next input token.",

        "The learning procedure is global since model parameters are set relative to classifying the entire dependency graph, in contrast to the local but richer contexts used by transition-based parsers.",
        "The system can be trained using first or second order models.",
        "The second order projective algorithm performed best on both conversions, and we used it in the rest of the evaluations.",

        "We will examine the influence of each type of semantic information on sentences that contain or not POS errors, and this will clarify whether the increments obtained when using semantic information are useful for correcting the negative influence of POS errors or they are orthogonal and constitute a source of new information independent of POS tags.",
        "With this objective in mind, we analyzed the performance on the subset of the test corpus containing the sentences which had POS errors (1,025 sentences and 27,300 tokens) and the subset where the sentences had (automatically assigned) correct POS tags (1,391 sentences and 29,386 tokens).",

        "Table 5 suggests that the improvements coming from Word-Net's semantic file (SF) are unevenly distributed between the sentences that contain POS errors and those that do not (an increase of 0.28 for sentences without POS errors and 0.55 for those with er-rors).",
        "This could mean that a big part of the information contained in SF helps to alleviate the errors performed by the automatic POS tagger.",
        "On the other hand, the increments are more evenly distributed for SS and clusters, and this can be due to the fact that the semantic information is orthogonal to the POS, giving similar improvements for sentences that contain or not POS errors.",
        "We independently tested this fact for the individual parsers.",

        "5 Conclusions This work has tried to shed light on the contribution of semantic information to dependency parsing.",
        "The experiments were thorough, testing two treebank conversions and three parsing paradigms on automatically predicted POS tags.",
        "Compared to (Agirre et al., 2011), which used MaltParser on the LTH conversion and gold POS tags, our results can be seen as a negative outcome, as the improvements are very small and non-significant in most of the cases.",
        "For parser combination, WordNet semantic file information does give a small significant increment in the more fine-grained LTH representation.",
        "In addition we show that the improvement of automatic clusters is also weak.",
