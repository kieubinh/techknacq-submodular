        "Dependency parsers assign a syntactic dependency tree to an input sentence (K?ubler et al., 2009), as exemplified in Figure 1.",
        "Graph-based dependency parsers parameterize models directly over substructures of the tree, including single arcs (McDonald et al., 2005), sibling or grandparent arcs (McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Car-reras, 2007) or higher-order substructures (Koo and Collins, 2010; Ma and Zhao, 2012).",
        "As the scope of each feature function increases so does parsing complexity, e.g., o(n 5 ) for fourth-order dependency parsing (Ma and Zhao, 2012).",
        "This has led to work on approximate inference, typically via pruning (Bergsma and Cherry, 2010; Rush and Petrov, 2012; He et al., 2013) Recently, it has been shown that cube-pruning (Chiang, 2007) can efficiently introduce higher-order dependencies in graph-based parsing (Zhang and McDonald, 2012).",
        "Cube-pruned dependency parsing runs standard bottom-up chart parsing using the lower-order algorithms.",
        "Similar to k-best inference, each chart cell maintains a beam of k-best partial dependency structures.",
        "Higher-order features are scored when combining beams during inference.",
        "Cube-pruning is an approximation, as the highest scoring tree may fall out of the beam before being fully scored with higher-order features.",
        "However, Zhang et al. (2013) observe state-of-the-art results when training accounts for errors that arise due to such approximations.",
        "John emailed April about one month ago NSUBJ IOBJ ADVMOD Q U A N T M O D N U M N P A D V M O D Figure 1: A sample dependency parse.",
        "In this work we extend the cube-pruning framework of Zhang et al. by observing that dependency parsing has two fundamental sources of ambiguity.",
        "The first, structural ambiguity, pertains to confusions about the unlabeled structure of the tree, e.g., the classic prepositional phrase attachment problem.",
        "The second, label ambiguity, pertains to simple label confusions, e.g., whether a verbal object is direct or indirect.",
        "Distinctions between arc labels are frequently fine-grained and easily confused by parsing models.",
        "For example, in the Stanford dependency label set (De Marneffe et al., 2006), the labels TMOD (temporal modifier), NPADVMOD (noun- phrase adverbial modifier), IOBJ (indirect object) and DOBJ (direct object) can all be noun phrases that modify verbs to their right.",
        "In the context of cube-pruning, during inference, the system opts to maintain a large amount of label ambiguity at the expense of structural ambiguity.",
        "Frequently, the beam stores only label ambiguities and the resulting set of trees have identical unlabeled structure.",
        "For example, in Figure 1, the aforementioned label ambiguity around noun objects to the right of the verb (DOBJ vs. IOBJ vs. TMP) could lead one or more of the structural ambiguities falling out of the beam, especially if the beam is small.",
        "To combat this, we introduce a secondary beam for each unique unlabeled structure.",
        "That is, we partition the primary (entire) beam into disjoint groups according to the identity of unlabeled structure.",
        "By limiting the size of the secondary beam, we restrict label ambiguity and enforce structural diversity within the primary beam.",
        "The resulting parser consistently improves on the state-of-the-art parser of Zhang et al. (2013).",
        "In 656 (a) l = l + l 1 (b) l = l 1 + l 2 Figure 2: Structures and rules for parsing with the (Eisner, 1996) algorithm.",
        "Solid lines show only the construction of right-pointing first-order dependencies.",
        "l is the predicted arc label.",
        "Dashed lines are the additional sibling modifier signatures in a generalized algorithm, specifically the previous modifier in complete chart items.",
        "particular, data sets with large label sets (and thus a large number of label confusions) typically see the largest jumps in accuracy.",
        "Finally, we show that the same result cannot be achieved by simply increasing the size of the beam, but requires explicit enforcing of beam diversity.",
        "2 Structural Diversity in Cube-Pruning Our starting point is the cube-pruned dependency parsing model of Zhang and McDonald (2012).",
        "In that work, as here, inference is simply the Eisner first-order parsing model (Eisner, 1996) shown in Figure 2.",
        "In order to score higher-order fea-tures, each chart item maintains a list of signa-tures, which represent subtrees consistent with the chart item.",
        "The stored signatures are the relevant portions of the subtrees that will be part of higher-order feature calculations.",
        "For example, to score features over adjacent arcs, we might maintain additional signatures, again shown in Figure 2.",
        "The scope of the signature adds asymptotic complexity to parsing.",
        "Even for second-order sib-lings, there will now be O(n) possible signatures per chart item.",
        "The result is that parsing complexity increases from O(n 3 ) to O(n 5 ).",
        "Instead of storing all signatures, Zhang and McDonald (2012) store the current k-best in a beam.",
        "This results in approximate inference, as some signatures may fall out of the beam before higher-order features can be scored.",
        "This general trick is known as cube-pruning and is a common approach to dealing with large hypergraph search spaces in machine translation (Chiang, 2007).",
        "Cube-pruned parsing is analogous to k-best parsing algorithmically.",
        "But there is a fundamental difference.",
        "In k-best parsing, if two subtrees t a and t b belong to the same chart item, with t a l = 0 : 1 : 2 : + l 1 l 2 l 1 0 : l 1 1 : l 2 2 : l 3 l = 0 : 1 : 2 : + l 1 l 2 l 1 0 : l 1 1 : l 2 2 : l 1 Figure 3: Merging procedure in cube pruning.",
        "The bottom shows that enforcing diversity in the k-best lists can give chance to a good structure at (2, 2).",
        "ranking higher than t b , then an extension of t a through combing with a subtree t c from another chart item must also score higher than that of t b .",
        "This property is called the monotonicity property.",
        "Based on it, k-best parsing merges k-best subtrees in the following way: given two chart items with k-best lists to be combined, it proceeds on the two sorted lists monotonically from beginning to end to generate combinations.",
        "Cube pruning follows the merging procedure despite the loss of monotonicity due to the addition of higher-order feature functions over the signatures of the subtrees.",
        "The underlying assumption of cube pruning is that the true k-best results are likely in the cross-product space of top-ranked component subtrees.",
        "Figure 3 shows that the space is the top-left corner of the grid in the binary branching cases.",
        "As mentioned earlier, the elements in chart item k-best lists are feature signatures of subtrees.",
        "We make a distinction between labeled signatures and unlabeled signatures.",
        "As feature functions are defined on sub-graphs of the dependency trees, a feature signature is labeled if and only if feature functions draw information from both the arcs in the sub-graph and the labels on the arcs.",
        "Every labeled signature projects to an unlabeled signature 657 that ignores the arc labels.",
        "The motivation for introducing unlabeled signatures for labeled parsing is to enforce structural diversity.",
        "Figure 3 illustrates the idea.",
        "In the top diagram, there is only one unlabeled signature in one of the two lists.",
        "This is likely to happen when there is label ambiguity so that all three labels have similar scores.",
        "In such cases, alternative tree structures further down in the list that have the potential to be scored higher when incorporating higher-order features, lose this opportunity due to pruning.",
        "By contrast, if we introduce structural diversity by limiting the number of label variants, such alternative structures can come out on top.",
        "More formally, when the feature signatures of the subtrees include arc labels, the cardinality of the set of all possible signatures grows by a polynomial of the size of the label set.",
        "This factor has a diluting effect on the diversity of unlabeled signatures within the beam.",
        "The larger the label set is, the greater the chance label ambiguity will dominate the beam.",
        "Therefore, we introduce a second level of beam specifically for labeled signatures.",
        "We call it the secondary beam, relative to the primary beam, i.e., the entire beam.",
        "The secondary beam limits the number of labeled signatures for each unlabeled signature, a projection of labeled signature, while the primary beam limits the total number of labeled signatures.",
        "To illustrate this, consider an original primary beam of length b and a secondary beam length of s b .",
        "Let t j i represent the i th highest scoring labeled variant of unlabeled structure j.",
        "The table below shows a specific example of beam configurations for b = 4 for all possible values of s b .",
        "The original beam is the pathological case where all signatures have the same unlabeled projection.",
        "When s b = 1, all signatures in the beam now have a different unlabeled projection.",
        "When s b = 4, the beam reverts to the original without any structural diversity.",
        "Values between balance structural and label diversity.",

        "Impor-tantly, the biggest wins are primarily for labels in which unlabeled attachment is lower than average (93.99, 8 out of 10).",
        "Thus, diversity pruning gets most of its wins on difficult attachment decisions.",
        "Indeed, many of the relations represent clausal dependencies that are frequently structurally ambiguous.",
        "There are also cases of relatively short dependencies that can be difficult to attach.",
        "For instance, quantmod dependencies are typically adverbs occurring after verbs that modify quantities to their right.",
        "But these can be confused as adverbial modifiers of the verb to the left.",
        "These results support our hypothesis that label ambiguity is causing hard attachment decisions to be pruned and that structural diversity can ameliorate this.",
        "4 Discussion Keeping multiple beams in approximate search has been explored in the past.",
        "In machine transla-tion, multiple beams are used to prune translation hypotheses at different levels of granularity (Zens and Ney, 2008).",
        "However, the focus is improving the speed of translation decoder rather than improving translation quality through enforcement of hypothesis diversity.",
        "In parsing, Bohnet and Nivre (2012) and Bohnet et al. (2013) propose a model for joint morphological analysis, part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing using a 2 Using eval.pl from Buchholz and Marsi (2006).",

        "With a single beam, token level ambiguities (morphology and tags) dominate and dependency level ambiguity is suppressed.",
        "This is addressed by essentially keeping two beams.",
        "The first forces every tree to be different at the dependency level and the second stores the remaining highest scoring options, which can include outputs that differ only at the token level.",
        "The present work looks at beam diversity in graph-based dependency parsing, in particular label versus structural diversity.",
        "It was shown that by keeping a diverse beam significant improvements could be achieved on standard benchmarks, in particular with respect to difficult attachment decisions.",
        "It is worth pointing out that other dependency parsing frameworks (e.g., transition-based parsing (Zhang and Clark, 2008; Zhang and Nivre, 2011)) could also benefit from modeling structural diversity in search.",
