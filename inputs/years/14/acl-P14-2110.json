        "Topic models (Blei et al., 2003) have become standard tools for analyzing document collections, and topic analyses are quite common for social media (Paul and Dredze, 2011; Zhao et al., 2011; Hong and Davison, 2010; Ramage et al., 2010; Eisenstein et al., 2010).",
        "Their popularity owes in part to their data driven nature, allowing them to adapt to new corpora and languages.",
        "In social media espe-cially, there is a large diversity in terms of both the topic and language, necessitating the modeling of multiple languages simultaneously.",
        "A good candidate for multi-lingual topic analyses are polylingual topic models (Mimno et al., 2009), which learn topics for multiple languages, creating tuples of language specific distributions over monolingual vocabularies for each topic.",
        "Polylingual topic models enable cross language analysis by grouping documents by topic regardless of language.",
        "Training of polylingual topic models requires parallel or comparable corpora: document tuples from multiple languages that discuss the same topic.",
        "While additional non-aligned documents User 1: ?Don Samuel es un crack!",
        "#VamosM?exico #DaleTri RT @User4: Arriba!",

        "Ja ja ja Football well said Figure 1: Three users discuss Mexico's football team advancing to the Gold medal game in the 2012 Olympics in code-switched Spanish and English.",
        "can be folded in during training, the ?glue?",
        "documents are required to aid in the alignment across languages.",
        "However, the ever changing vocabulary and topics of social media (Eisenstein, 2013) make finding suitable comparable corpora difficult.",
        "Standard techniques ?",
        "such as relying on machine translation parallel corpora or comparable documents extracted from Wikipedia in different languages ?",
        "fail to capture the specific terminology of social media.",
        "Alternate methods that rely on bilingual lexicons (Jagarlamudi and Daum?e, 2010) similarly fail to adapt to shifting vocabularies.",
        "The result: an inability to train polylingual models on social media.",
        "In this paper, we offer a solution: utilize code-switched social media to discover correlations across languages.",
        "Social media is filled with examples of code-switching, where users switch between two or more languages, both in a conversation and even a single message (Ling et al., 2013).",
        "This mixture of languages in the same context suggests alignments between words across languages through the common topics discussed in the context.",
        "We learn from code-switched social media by extending the polylingual topic model framework to infer the language of each token and then automatically processing the learned topics to identify aligned topics.",
        "Our model improves both in terms of perplexity and a human evaluation, and we provide some example analyses of social media that rely on our learned topics.",
        "674 2 Code-Switching Code-switched documents has received considerable attention in the NLP community.",
        "Several tasks have focused on identification and analysis, including mining translations in code-switched documents (Ling et al., 2013), predicting code-switched points (Solorio and Liu, 2008a), identifying code-switched tokens (Lignos and Marcus, 2013; Yu et al., 2012; Elfardy and Diab, 2012), adding code-switched support to language models (Li and Fung, 2012), linguistic processing of code switched data (Solorio and Liu, 2008b), corpus creation (Li et al., 2012; Diab and Kamboj, 2011), and computational linguistic analyses and theories of code-switching (Sankofl, 1998; Joshi, 1982).",
        "Code-switching specifically in social media has also received some recent attention.",
        "Lignos and Marcus (2013) trained a supervised token level language identification system for Spanish and English code-switched social media to study code-switching behaviors.",
        "Ling et al. (2013) mined translation spans for Chinese and English in code-switched documents to improve a translation sys-tem, relying on an existing translation model to aid in the identification and extraction task.",
        "In contrast to this work, we take an unsupervised approach, relying only on readily available document level language ID systems to utilize code-switched data.",
        "Additionally, our focus is not on individual mes-sages, rather we aim to train a model that can be used to analyze entire corpora.",
        "In this work we consider two types of code-switched documents: single messages and conver-sations, and two language pairs: Chinese-English and Spanish-English.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of a code-switched Spanish-English conversa-tion, in which three users discuss Mexico's football team advancing to the Gold medal game in the 2012 Summer Olympics.",
        "In this conversation, some tweets are code-switched and some are in a single language.",
        "By collecting the entire conversation into a single document we provide the topic model with additional content.",
        "An example of a Chinese-English code-switched messages is given by Ling et al. (2013): watup Kenny Mayne!!",
        "Kenny Mayne ??????!!",
        "Here a user switches between languages in a single message.",
        "We empirically evaluate our model on both conversations and messages.",
        "In the model presentation we will refer to both as ?documents.?",
        "3 csLDA To train a polylingual topic model on social me-dia, we make two modifications to the model of Mimno et al. (2009): add a token specific language variable, and a process for identifying aligned topics.",
        "First, polylingual topic models require parallel or comparable corpora in which each document has an assigned language.",
        "In the case of code-switched social media data, we require a per-token language variable.",
        "However, while document level language identification (LID) systems are common place, very few languages have per-token LID systems (King and Abney, 2013; Lignos and Marcus, 2013).",
        "To address the lack of available LID systems, we add a per-token latent language variable to the polylingual topic model.",
        "For documents that are not code-switched, we observe these variables to be the output of a document level LID system.",
        "In the case of code-switched documents, these variables are inferred during model inference.",
        "Second, polylingual topic models assume the aligned topics are from parallel or comparable cor-pora, which implicitly assumes that a topics popularity is balanced across languages.",
        "Topics that show up in one language necessarily show up in another.",
        "However, in the case of social media, we can make no such assumption.",
        "The topics discussed are influenced by users, time, and lo-cation, all factors intertwined with choice of language.",
        "For example, English speakers will more likely discuss Olympic basketball while Spanish speakers football.",
        "There may be little or no documents on a given topic in one language, while they are plentiful in another.",
        "In this case, a polylingual topic model, which necessarily infers a topic-specific word distribution for each topic in each language, would learn two unrelated word distributions in two languages for a single topic.",
        "Therefore, naively using the produced topics as ?aligned?",
        "across languages is ill-advised.",
        "Our solution is to automatically identify aligned polylingual topics after learning by examining a topic's distribution across code-switched documents.",
        "Our metric relies on distributional properties of an inferred topic across the entire collection.",
        "675 To summarize, based on the model of Mimno et al. (2009) we will learn: ?",
        "For each topic, a language specific word distribution.",
        "?",

        "?",
        "For each topic, an identification as to whether the topic captures an alignment across languages.",
        "The first two goals are achieved by incorporating new hidden variables in the traditional polylingual topic model.",
        "The third goal requires an automated post-processing step.",

        "Topics appearing in at least one code-switched document with probability greater than a threshold p are selected as candidates for true cross-language topics.",
        "4 Data We used two datasets: a Sina Weibo Chinese-English corpus (Ling et al., 2013) and a Spanish-English Twitter corpus.",
        "Weibo Ling et al. (2013) extracted over 1m Chinese-English parallel segments from Sina Weibo, which are code-switched messages.",
        "We randomly sampled 29,705 code-switched messages along with 42,116 Chinese and 42,116 English messages from the the same time frame.",
        "We used these data for training.",
        "We then sampled an additional 2475 code-switched messages, 4221 English and 4211 Chinese messages as test data.",
        "Olympics We collected tweets from July 27, 2012 to August 12, 2012, and identified 302,775 tweets about the Olympics based on related hash-tags and keywords (e.g. olympics, #london2012, etc.)",
        "We identified code-switched tweets using the Chromium Language Detector 2 .",
        "This system provides the top three possible languages for a given document with confidence scores; we identify a tweet as code-switched if two predicted languages each have confidence greater than 33%.",
        "We then used the tagger of Lignos and Marcus (2013) to obtain token level LID tags, and only tweets with tokens in both Spanish and English are used as code-switched tweets.",
        "In total we identified 822 Spanish-English code-switched tweets.",
        "We further expanded the mined tweets to full con-versations, yielding 1055 Spanish-English code-switched documents (including both tweets and conversations), along with 4007 English and 4421 Spanish tweets composes our data set.",
        "We reserve 10% of the data for testing.",
        "5 Experiments We evaluated csLDA on the two datasets and evaluated each model using perplexity on held out data and human judgements.",
        "While our goal is to learn polylingual topics, we cannot compare to previous polylingual models since they require comparable data, which we lack.",
        "Instead, we constructed a baseline from LDA run on the entire dataset (no 2 https://code.google.com/p/chromium-compact-language-detector/ language information.)",
        "For each model, we measured the document completion perplexity (Rosen- Zvi et al., 2004) on the held out data.",
        "We experimented with different numbers of topics (T ).",
        "Since csLDA duplicates topic distributions (T ?L) we used twice as many topics for LDA.",
        "Figure 3 shows test perplexity for varying T and perplexity for the best setting of csLDA (T =60) and LDA (T =120).",
        "The table lists both monolingual and code-switched test data; csLDA improves over LDA in almost every case, and across all values of T .",
        "The background distribution (-bg) has mixed results for LDA, whereas for csLDA it shows consistent improvement.",
        "Table 4 shows some csLDA topics.",
        "While there are some mis-takes, overall the topics are coherent and aligned.",
        "We use the available per-token LID system (Lignos and Marcus, 2013) for Spanish/English to justify csLDA's ability to infer the hidden language variables.",
        "We ran csLDA-bg with l i set to the value provided by the LID system for code-switched documents (csLDA-bg with LID), which gives csLDA high quality LID labels.",
        "While we see gains for the code-switched data, overall the results for csLDA-bg and csLDA-bg with LID are similar, suggesting that the model can operate effectively even without a supervised per-token LID system.",
        "5.1 Human Evaluation We evaluate topic alignment quality through a human judgements (Chang et al., 2009).",
        "For each aligned topic, we show an annotator the 20 most frequent words from the foreign language topic (Chinese or Spanish) with the 20 most frequent words from the aligned English topic and two random English topics.",
        "The annotators are asked to select the most related English topic among the three; the one with the most votes is considered the aligned topic.",
        "We count how often the model's alignments agree.",
        "LDA may learn comparable topics in different languages but gives no explicit alignments.",
        "We create alignments by classifying each LDA topic by language using the KL-divergence between the topic's words distribution and a word distribution for the English/foreign language inferred from the monolingual documents.",
        "Language is assigned to a topic by taking the minimum KL.",
