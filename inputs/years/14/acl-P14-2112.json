        "Work by Talbot and Osborne (2007), Van Durme and Lall (2009) and Goyal et al. (2009) considered the problem of building very large language models via the use of randomized data structures known as sketches.",
        "1 While efficient, these structures still scale linearly in the number of items stored, and do not handle deletions well: if processing an unbounded stream of text, with new words and phrases being regularly added to the model, then with a fixed amount of space, errors will only increase over time.",
        "This was pointed out by Levenberg and Osborne (2009), who investigated an alternate approach employing perfect-hashing to allow for deletions over time.",
        "Their deletion criterion was task-specific and based on how a machine translation system queried a language model.",
        "?",
        "Corresponding author: miles@inf.ed.ac.uk 1 Sketches provide space efficiencies that are measured on the order of individual bits per item stored, but at the cost of being lossy: sketches trade off space for error, where the less space you use, the more likely you will get erroneous responses to queries.",
        "Here we ask what the appropriate selection criterion is for streaming data based on a non-stationary process, when concerned with an intrinsic measure such as perplexity.",
        "Using Twitter and newswire, we pursue this via a sampling strat-egy: we construct models over sentences based on a sample of previously observed sentences, then measure perplexity of incoming sentences, all on a day by day, rolling basis.",
        "Three sampling approaches are considered: A fixed-width sliding window of most recent content, uniformly at random over the stream and a biased sample that prefers recent history over the past.",
        "We show experimentally that a moving window is better than uniform sampling, and further that exponential (biased) sampling is best of all.",
        "For streaming data, recently encountered data is valu-able, but there is also signal in the previous stream.",
        "Our sampling methods are based on reservoir sampling (Vitter, 1985), a popularly known method in some areas of computer science, but which has seen little use within computational linguistics.",
        "2 Standard reservoir sampling is a method for maintaining a uniform sample over a dynamic stream of elements, using constant space.",
        "Novel to this community, we consider a variant owing to Aggarwal (2006) which provides for an exponential bias towards recently observed elements.",
        "This exponential reservoir sampling has all of the guarantees of standard reservoir sampling, but as we show, is a better fit for streaming textual data.",
        "Our approach is fully general and can be applied to any streaming task where we need to model the present and can only use fixed space.",
        "2 Exceptions include work by Van Durme and Lall (2011) and Van Durme (2012), aimed at different problems than that explored here.",
        "687 2 Background We address two problems: language changes over time, and the observation that space is a problem, even for compact sketches.",
        "Statistical language models often assume either a local Markov property (when working with ut-terances, or sentences), or that content is generated fully i.i.d.",
        "(such as in document-level topic models).",
        "However, language shows observable priming effects, sometimes called triggers, where the occurrence of a given term decreases the sur-prisal of some other term later in the same discourse (Lau et al., 1993; Church and Gale, 1995; Beeferman et al., 1997; Church, 2000).",
        "Conventional cache and trigger models typically do not deal with new terms and can be seen as adjusting the parameters of a fixed model.",
        "Accounting for previously unseen entries in a language model can be naively simple: as they appear in new training data, add them to the model!",
        "However in practice we are constrained by available space: how many unique phrases can we store, given the target application environment?",
        "Our work is concerned with modeling language that might change over time, in accordance with current trending discourse topics, but under a strict space constraint.",
        "With a fixed amount of memory available, we cannot allow our list of unique words or phrases to grow over time, even while new topics give rise to novel names of people, places, and terms of interest.",
        "Thus we need an approach that keeps the size of the model constant, but that is geared to what is being discussed now, as compared to some time in the past.",
        "3 Reservoir Sampling 3.1 Uniform Reservoir Sampling The reservoir sampling algorithm (Vitter, 1985) is the classic method of sampling without replacement from a stream in a single pass when the length of the stream is of indeterminate or unbounded length.",
        "Say that the size of the desired sample is k. The algorithm proceeds by retaining the first k items of the stream and then sampling each subsequent element with probability f(k, n) = k/n, where n is the length of the stream so far.",
        "(See Algorithm 1.)",
        "It is easy to show via induction that, at any time, all the items in the stream so far have equal probability of appearing in the reservoir.",
        "The algorithm processes the stream in a single pass?that is, once it has processed an item in the stream, it does not revisit that item unless it is stored in the reservoir.",
        "Given this restriction, the incredible feature of this algorithm is that it is able to guarantee that the samples in the reservoir are a uniformly random sample with no unintended biases even as the stream evolves.",
        "This makes it an excellent candidate for situations when the stream is continuously being updated and it is computationally infeasible to store the entire stream or to make more than a single pass over it.",
        "Moreover, it is an extremely efficient algorithm as it requires O(1) time (independent of the reservoir size and stream length) for each item in the stream.",
        "Algorithm 1 Reservoir Sampling Algorithm Parameters: k: maximum size of reservoir 1: Initialize an empty reservoir (any container data type).",
        "2: n := 1 3: for each item in the stream do 4: if n < k then 5: insert current item into the reservoir 6: else 7: with probability f(n, k), eject an element of the reservoir chosen uniformly at random and insert current item into the reservoir 8: n := n+ 1 3.2 Non-uniform Reservoir Sampling Here we will consider generalizations of the reservoir sampling algorithm in which the sample items in the reservoir are more biased towards the present.",
        "Put another way, we will continuously decay the probability that an older item will appear in the reservoir.",
        "Models produced using such biases put more modelling stress on the present than models produced using data that is selected uniformly from the stream.",
        "The goal here is to continuously update the reservoir sample in such a way that the decay of older items is done consistently while still maintaining the benefits of reservoir sampling, including the single pass and mem-ory/time constraints.",
        "The time-decay scheme we will study in this paper is exponential bias towards newer items in the stream.",

        "To give a sense of what these time-decay probabilities look like, some exponential distributions are plotted (along with the uniform distribution) in Figure 1.",
        "Aggarwal (2006) studied this problem and showed that by altering the sampling probability (f(n, k) in Algorithm 1) in the reservoir sampling algorithm, it is possible to achieve different age-related biases in the sample.",
        "In particular, he showed that by setting the sampling probability to the constant function f(n, k) = k/?, it is possible to approximately achieve exponential bias in the sample with scale parameter ?",

        "3.3 Analysis In this section we will derive an expression for the bias introduced by an arbitrary sampling function f in Algorithm 1.",
        "We will then use this expression to derive the precise sampling function needed to achieve exponential decay.",
        "3 Careful selection of f allows us to achieve anything from zero decay (i.e., uniform sampling of the entire stream) to exponential decay.",
        "Once again, note that since we are only changing the sampling function, the 3 Specifying an arbitrary decay function remains an open problem.",
        "one-pass, memory- and time-efficient properties of reservoir sampling are still being preserved.",
        "In the following analysis, we fix n to be the size of the stream at some fixed time and k to be the size of the reservoir.",
