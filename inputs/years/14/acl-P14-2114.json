        "Event extraction is to automatically identify events from text with information about what happened, when, where, to whom, and why.",
        "Previous work in event extraction has focused largely on news ar-ticles, as the newswire texts have been the best source of information on current events (Hogen- boom et al., 2011).",
        "Approaches for event extraction include knowledge-based (Piskorski et al., 2007; Tanev et al., 2008), data-driven (Piskorski et al., 2008) and a combination of the above two categories (Grishman et al., 2005).",
        "Knowledge-based approaches often rely on linguistic and lexicographic patterns which represent expert domain knowledge for particular event types.",
        "They lack the flexibility of porting to new domains since extraction patterns often need to be re-defined.",
        "Data-driven approaches require large annotated data to train statistical models that approximate linguistic phenomena.",
        "Nevertheless, it is expensive to obtain annotated data in practice.",
        "With the increasing popularity of social media, social networking sites such as Twitter have become an important source of event information.",
        "As reported in (Petrovic et al., 2013), even 1% of the public stream of Twitter contains around 95% of all the events reported in the newswire.",
        "Never-theless, the social stream data such as Twitter data pose new challenges.",
        "Social media messages are often short and evolve rapidly over time.",
        "As such, it is not possible to know the event types a priori and hence violates the use of existing event extraction approaches.",
        "Approaches to event extraction from Twitter make use of a graphical model to extract canonical entertainment events from tweets by aggregating information across multiple messages (Benson et al., 2011).",
        "In (Liu et al., 2012), social events involving two persons are extracted from multiple similar tweets using a factor graph by harvesting the redundancy in tweets.",
        "Ritter et al. (2012) presented a system called TwiCal which extracts an open-domain calendar of significant events represented by a 4-tuple set including a named entity, event phrase, calendar date, and event type from Twitter.",
        "In our work here, we notice a very important property in social media data that the same event could be referenced by high volume messages.",
        "This property allows us resort to statistical models that can group similar events based on the co-occurrence patterns of their event elements.",
        "Here, event elements include named entities such as per-son, company, organization, date/time, location, and the relations among them.",
        "We can treat an event as a latent variable and model the generation of an event as a joint distribution of its individual event elements.",
        "We thus propose a Latent Event Model (LEM) which can automatically detect events from social media without the use of labeled data.",

        "Figure 1: The proposed framework for event extraction from tweets.",
        "Our work is similar to TwiCal in the sense that we also focus on the extraction of structured representation of events from Twitter.",
        "However, TwiCal relies on a supervised sequence labeler trained on tweets annotated with event mentions for the identification of event-related phrases.",
        "We propose a simple Bayesian modelling approach which is able to directly extract event-related keywords from tweets without supervised learning.",
        "Also, TwiCal uses G 2 test to choose an entity y with the strongest association with a date d to form a binary tuple ?y, d?",
        "to represent an event.",
        "On the contrary, the structured representation of events can be directly extracted from the output of our LEM model.",
        "We have conducted experiments on a Twitter corpus and the results show that our proposed approach outperforms TwiCal, the state-of-the-art open event extraction system, by 7.7% in F-measure.",
        "2 Methodology Events extracted in our proposed framework are represented as a 4-tuple ?y, d, l, k?, where y stands for a non-location named entity, d for a date, l for a location, and k for an event-related keyword.",
        "Each event mentioned in tweets can be closely depicted by this representation.",
        "It should be noted that for some events, one or more elements in their corresponding tuples might be absent as their related information is not available in tweets.",
        "As illustrated in Figure 1, our proposed framework consists of three main steps, pre-processing, event extraction based on the LEM model and post-processing.",
        "The details of our proposed framework are described below.",
        "2.1 Pre-processing Tweets are pre-processed by time expression recognition, named entity recognition, POS tagging and stemming.",
        "Time Expression Recognition.",
        "Twitter users might represent the same date in various forms.",
        "For example, ?tomorrow?, ?next Monday?, ?",
        "August 23th?",
        "in tweets might all refer to the same day, depending on the date that users wrote the tweets.",
        "To resolve the ambiguity of the time ex-pressions, SUTime 1 (Chang and Manning, 2012) is employed, which takes text and a reference date as input and outputs a more accurate date which the time expression refers to.",
        "Named Entity Recognition.",
        "Named entity recognition (NER) is a crucial step since the results would directly impact the final extracted 4-tuple ?y, d, l, k?.",
        "It is not easy to accurately identify named entities in the Twitter data since tweets contain a lot of misspellings and abbreviations.",
        "However, it is often observed that events mentioned in tweets are also reported in news articles in the same period (Petrovic et al., 2013).",
        "Therefore, named entities mentioned in tweets are likely to appear in news articles as well.",
        "We thus perform named entity recognition in the following way.",
        "First, a traditional NER tool such as the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer 2 is used to identify named entities from the news articles crawled from BBC and CNN during the same period that the tweets were published.",
        "The recognised named entities from news are then used to build a dictionary.",
        "Named entities from tweets are extracted by looking up the dictionary through fuzzy matching.",
        "We have also used a named entity tagger trained specifically on the Twitter data 3 (Ritter et al., 2011) to directly extract named entities from tweets.",
        "However, as will be shown in Section 3 that using our constructed dictionary for named entity extraction gives better results.",
        "We distinguish between location entities, denoted as l, and non-location entities such as person or organization, denoted as y.",
        "1 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/ sutime.shtml 2 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/ CRF-NER.shtml 3 http://github.com/aritter/twitter-nlp 701 Finally, we use a POS tagger 4 trained on tweets (Gimpel et al., 2011) to perform POS tagging on the tweets data and apart from the previously recognised named entities, only words tagged with nouns, verbs or adjectives are kept.",
        "These remaining words are subsequently stemmed and words occurred less than 3 times are filtered.",
        "After the pre-processing step, non-location entities y, locations l, dates d and candidate keywords of the tweets are collected as the input to the LEM model for event extraction.",
        "2.2 Event Extraction using the Latent Event Model (LEM) We propose an unsupervised latent variable model, called the Latent Event Model (LEM), to extract events from tweets.",
