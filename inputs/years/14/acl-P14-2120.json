        "We investigate recognizing implied predicate-argument relationships which are not explicitly expressed in syntactic structure.",
        "While prior works addressed such relationships as an extension to semantic role labeling, our work investigates them in the context of textual inference scenarios.",
        "Such scenarios provide prior information, which substantially eases the task.",
        "We provide a large and freely available evaluation dataset for our task setting, and propose methods to cope with it, while obtaining promising results in empirical evaluations.",
        "1 Motivation and Task This paper addresses a typical sub-task in textual inference scenarios, of recognizing implied predicate-argument relationships which are not expressed explicitly through syntactic structure.",
        "Consider the following example: (i) The crucial role Vioxx plays in Merck's portfolio was apparent last week when Merck's shares plunged 27 percent to 33 dollars after the withdrawal announcement.",
        "While a human reader understands that the withdrawal refers to Vioxx, and hence an implied predicate-argument relationship holds between them, this relationship is not expressed in the syntactic structure, and will be missed by syntactic parsers or standard semantic role labelers.",
        "This paper targets such types of implied relationships in textual inference scenarios.",
        "Partic-ularly, we investigate the setting of Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) as a typical scenario of textual inference.",
        "We suggest, however, that the same challenge, as well as the solutions proposed in our work, are applicable, with proper adap-tations, to other textual-inference scenarios, like Question Answering, and Information Extraction (see Section 6).",
        "An RTE problem instance is composed of two text fragments, termed Text and Hypothesis, as input.",
        "The task is to recognize whether a human reading the Text would infer that the Hypothesis is most likely true (Dagan et al., 2006).",
        "For our problem, consider a positive Text Hypothesis pair, where the Text is example (i) above and the Hypothesis is: (ii) Merck withdrew Vioxx.",
        "A common approach for recognizing textual entailment is to verify that all the textual elements of the Hypothesis are covered, or aligned, by elements of the Text.",
        "These elements typically include lexical terms as well as relationships between them.",
        "In our example, the Hypothesis lexical terms (?Merck?, ?withdrew?",
        "and ?Vioxx?)",
        "are indeed covered by the Text.",
        "Yet, the predicate-argument relationships (e.g., ?withdrawal-Vioxx?)",
        "are not expressed in the text explicitly.",
        "In such a case, an RTE system has to verify that the predicate-argument relationships which are explicitly expressed in the Hypothesis, are implied from the Text discourse.",
        "Such cases are quite frequent (?17%) in the settings of our dataset, described in Section 3.",
        "Consequently, we define the task of recognizing implied predicate-argument relationships, with illustrating examples in Table 1, as follows.",
        "The input includes a Text and a Hypothesis.",
        "Two terms in the Hypothesis, predicate and argument, are marked, where a predicate-argument relationship between them is explicit in the Hypothesis syntactic structure.",
        "Two terms in the Text, candidate-predicate and candidate-argument, aligned to the Hypothesis predicate and argument, are marked as well.",
        "However, no predicate-argument relationship between them is expressed syntactically.",

        "argument relationship, as expressed in the Hypoth-esis, holds implicitly also in the Text.",
        "To address this task, we provide a large and freely available annotated dataset, and propose methods for coping with it.",
        "A related task, described in the next section, deals with such implied predicate-argument relationships as an extension to Semantic Role Labeling.",
        "While the results reported so far on that annotation task were relatively low, we suggest that the task itself may be more complicated than what is actually required in textual inference scenarios.",
        "On the other hand, the results obtained for our task, which does fit textual inference scenarios, are promising, and encourage utilizing algorithms for this task in actual inference systems.",
        "2 Prior Work The most notable work targeting implied predicate-argument relationships is the 2010 SemEval task of Linking Events and Their Participants in Discourse (Ruppenhofer et al., 2009).",
        "This task extends Semantic Role Labeling to cases in which a core argument of a predicate is missing in the syntactic structure but a filler for the corresponding semantic role appears elsewhere and can be inferred from discourse.",
        "For example, in the following sentence the semantic role goal is unfilled: (iii) He arrived (0 Goal ) at 8pm.",
        "Yet, we can expect to find an implied filler for goal elsewhere in the document.",
        "The SemEval task, termed henceforth as Implied SRL, involves three major sub-tasks.",
        "First, for each predicate, the unfilled roles, termed Null Instantiations (NI), should be detected.",
        "Second, each NI should be classified as Definite NI (DNI), meaning that the role filler must exist in the dis-course, or Indefinite NI otherwise.",
        "Third, the DNI fillers should be found (DNI linking).",
        "Later works that followed the SemEval challenge include (Silberer and Frank, 2012) and (Roth and Frank, 2013), which proposed auto-740 matic dataset generation methods and features which capture discourse phenomena.",
        "Their highest result was 12% F1-score.",
        "Another work is the probabilistic model of Laparra and Rigau (2012), which is trained by properties captured not only from implicit arguments but also from explicit ones, resulting in 19% F1-score.",
        "Another notable work is (Gerber and Chai, 2012), which was limited to ten carefully selected nominal predicates.",
        "2.1 Annotations vs.",
        "Recognition Comparing to the implied SRL task, our task may better fit the needs of textual inference.",
        "First, some relatively complex steps of the implied SRL task are avoided in our setting, while on the other hand it covers more relevant cases.",
        "More concretely, in textual inference the candidate predicate and argument are typically iden-tified, as they are aligned by the RTE system to a predicate and an argument of the Hypothesis.",
        "Thus, the only remaining challenge is to verify that the sought relationship is implied in the text.",
        "Therefore, the sub-tasks of identifying and classifying DNIs can be avoided.",
        "On the other hand, in some cases the candidate argument is not a DNI, but is still required in textual inference.",
        "One type of such cases are non-core arguments, which cannot be Definite NIs.",
        "However, textual inference deals with non-core arguments as well (see example 3 in Table 1).",
        "Another case is when an implied predicate-argument relationship holds even though the corresponding role is already filled by another argu-ment, hence not an NI.",
        "Consider example 4 of Table 1.",
        "While the object of ?threatened?",
        "is filled (in the Text) by ?southeastern United States?, a human reader also infers the ?threatened-New Or-leans?",
        "relationship.",
        "Such cases might follow a meronymy relation between the filler (?southeast- ern United States?)",
        "and the candidate argument (?New Orleans?",
        "), or certain types of discourse (co- )references (e.g., example 5 in Table 1), or some other linguistic phenomena.",
        "Either way, they are crucial for textual inference, while not being NIs.",
        "3 Dataset This section describes a semi-automatic method for extracting candidate instances of implied predicate-argument relationship from an RTE dataset.",
        "This extraction process directly follows our task formalization.",
        "Given a Text Hypothesis pair, we locate a predicate-argument relationship in the Hypothesis, where both the predicate and the argument appear also in the Text, while the relationship between them is not expressed in its syntactic structure.",
        "This process is performed automatically, based on syntactic parsing (see be-low).",
        "Then, a human reader annotates each instance as ?Yes?",
        "?",
        "meaning that the implied relationship indeed holds in the Text, or ?No?",
        "otherwise.",
        "Example instances, constructed by this pro-cess, are shown in Table 1.",
        "In this work we used lemma-level lexical matching, as well as nominalization matching, to align the Text predicates and arguments to the Hypothesis.",
        "We note that more advanced match-ing, e.g., by utilizing knowledge resources (like WordNet), can be performed as well.",
        "To identify explicit predicate-argument relationships we utilized dependency parsing by the Easy-First parser (Goldberg and Elhadad, 2010).",
        "Nominalization matching (e.g., example 1 of Table 1) was performed with Nomlex (Macleod et al., 1998).",
        "By applying this method on the RTE-6 dataset (Bentivogli et al., 2010), we constructed a dataset of 4022 instances, where 2271 (56%) are annotated as positive instances, and 1751 as negative ones.",
        "This dataset is significantly larger than prior datasets for the implied SRL task.",
        "To calculate inter-annotator agreement, the first author also annotated 185 randomly-selected instances.",

        "We point out that in textual inference scenarios the candidate predicate and argument are given by the Hypothesis, while the challenge is only to verify that a predicate-argument relationship between these candidates is implied from the given Text.",
        "Accordingly, some complex steps necessitated in the SemEval task can be avoided, while additional relevant cases are covered.",
        "Moreover, we have shown that this simpler task is more feasibly solvable, where our 15 features achieved more than 80% accuracy.",
        "While our dataset and algorithm were presented in the context of RTE, the same challenge and methods are applicable to other textual inference tasks as well.",
        "Consider, for example, the Question Answering (QA) task.",
        "Typically QA systems detect a candidate predicate that matches the question's predicate.",
        "Similarly, candidate argu-ments, which match either the expected answer type or other arguments in the question are detected too.",
        "Consequently, our methods which exploit the availability of the candidate predicate and argument can be adapted to this scenario as well.",
        "Similarly, a typical approach for Event Extraction (a sub task of Information Extraction) is to start by applying an entity extractor, which identifies argument candidates.",
        "Accordingly, candidate predicate and arguments are detected in this scenario too, while the remaining challenge is to assess the likelihood that a predicate-argument relationship holds between them.",
        "Following this observation, we propose future work of applying our methods to other tasks.",
        "An additional direction for future work is to further develop new methods for our task, possibly by incorporating SRL resources and/or linguistically oriented rules, in order to improve the results we achieved so far.",
