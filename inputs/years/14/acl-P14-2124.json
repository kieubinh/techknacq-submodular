        "We show that XMEANT, a new cross-lingual version of MEANT (Lo et al., 2012), correlates with human judgment even more closely than MEANT for evaluating MT adequacy via semantic frames, despite discarding the need for expensive human reference translations.",
        "XMEANT is obtained by (1) using simple lexical translation probabilities, instead of the monolingual context vector model used in MEANT for computing the semantic role fillers similarities, and (2) incorporating bracketing ITG constrains for word alignment within the semantic role fillers.",
        "We conjecture that the reason that XMEANT correlates more closely with human adequacy judgement than MEANT is that on the one hand, the semantic structure of the MT output is closer to that of the input sentence than that of the reference translation, and on the other hand, the BITG constraints the word alignment more accurately than the heuristic bag-of-word aggregation used in MEANT.",
        "Our results suggest that MT translation adequacy is more accurately evaluated via the cross-lingual semantic frame similarities of the input and the MT output which may obviate the need for expensive human reference translations.",
        "The MEANT family of metrics (Lo and Wu, 2011a, 2012; Lo et al., 2012) adopt the principle that a good translation is one where a human can successfully understand the central meaning of the foreign sentence as captured by the basic event structure: ?who did what to whom, when, where and why?",
        "(Pradhan et al., 2004).",
        "MEANT measures similarity between the MT output and the reference translations by comparing the similarities between the semantic frame structures of output and reference translations.",
        "It is well established that the MEANT family of metrics correlates better with human adequacy judgments than commonly used MT evaluation metrics (Lo and Wu, 2011a, 2012; Lo et al., 2012; Lo and Wu, 2013b; Mach?a?cek and Bojar, 2013).",
        "In addition, the translation adequacy across different genres (ranging from formal news to informal web forum and public speech) and different languages (English and Chinese) is improved by replacing BLEU or TER with MEANT during parameter tuning (Lo et al., 2013a; Lo and Wu, 2013a; Lo et al., 2013b).",
        "In order to continue driving MT towards better translation adequacy by deeply integrating semantic frame criteria into theMT training pipeline, it is necessary to have a cross-lingual semantic objective function that assesses the semantic frame similarities of input and output sentences.",
        "We therefore propose XMEANT, a cross-lingual MT evaluation metric, that modifies MEANT using (1) simple translation probabilities (in our experiments, 765 from quick IBM-1 training), to replace the monolingual context vector model in MEANT, and (2) constraints from BITGs (bracketing ITGs).",
        "We show that XMEANT assesses MT adequacy more accurately than MEANT (as measured by correlation with human adequacy judgement) without the need for expensive human reference translations in the output language.",
        "2 Related Work 2.1 MT evaluation metrics Surface-form oriented metrics such as BLEU (Pa- pineni et al., 2002), NIST (Doddington, 2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), CDER (Leusch et al., 2006), WER (Nie?en et al., 2000), and TER (Snover et al., 2006) do not correctly reflect the meaning similarities of the input sentence.",
        "In fact, a number of large scale meta-evaluations (Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Koehn and Monz, 2006) report cases where BLEU strongly disagrees with human judgments of translation adequacy.",
        "This has caused a recent surge of work to develop better ways to automatically measure MT adequacy.",
        "Owczarzak et al. (2007a,b) improved correlation with human fluency judgments by using LFG to extend the approach of evaluating syntactic dependency structure similarity proposed by Liu and Gildea (2005), but did not achieve higher correlation with human adequacy judgments than metrics like METEOR.",
        "TINE (Rios et al., 2011) is a recall-oriented metric which aims to preserve the basic event structure but it performs comparably to BLEU and worse than METEOR on correlation with human adequacy judgments.",
        "ULC (Gim?enez and M`arquez, 2007, 2008) incorporates several semantic features and shows improved correlation with human judgement on translation quality (Callison-Burch et al., 2007, 2008) but no work has been done towards tuning an SMT system using a pure form of ULC perhaps due to its expensive run time.",
        "Similarly, SPEDE (Wang and Man-ning, 2012) predicts the edit sequence for matching the MT output to the reference via an integrated probabilistic FSM and PDA model.",
        "Sagan (Castillo and Estrella, 2012) is a semantic textual similarity metric based on a complex textual entailment pipeline.",
        "These aggregated metrics require sophisticated feature extraction steps, contain several dozens of parameters to tune, and employ expensive linguistic resources like WordNet Figure 1: Monolingual MEANT algorithm.",
        "or paraphrase tables; the expensive training, tun-ing, and/or running time makes them hard to incorporate into the MT development cycle.",
        "2.2 The MEANT family of metrics MEANT (Lo et al., 2012), which is the weighted f-score over the matched semantic role labels of the automatically aligned semantic frames and role fillers, that outperforms BLEU, NIST, METEOR, WER, CDER and TER in correlation with human adequacy judgments.",
        "MEANT is easily portable to other languages, requiring only an automatic semantic parser and a large monolingual corpus in the output language for identifying the semantic structures and the lexical similarity between the semantic role fillers of the reference and translation.",
        "Figure 1 shows the algorithm and equations for computing MEANT.",
        "q 0 i,j and q 1 i,j are the argument of type j in frame i in MT and REF respectively.",
        "w 0 i and w 1 i are the weights for frame i in MT/REF respectively.",
        "These weights estimate the degree of contribution of each frame to the overall meaning of the sentence.",
        "w pred and w j are the weights of the lexical similarities of the predicates and role fillers of the arguments of type j of all frame between the reference translations and the MT out-766 Figure 2: Examples of automatic shallow semantic parses.",

        "There is a total of 12 weights for the set of semantic role labels in MEANT as defined in Lo and Wu (2011b).",
        "For MEANT, they are determined using supervised estimation via a simple grid search to optimize the correlation with human adequacy judgments (Lo and Wu, 2011a).",
        "For UMEANT (Lo and Wu, 2012), they are estimated in an unsupervised manner using relative frequency of each semantic role label in the references and thus UMEANT is useful when human judgments on adequacy of the development set are unavailable.",
        "s i,pred and s i,j are the lexical similarities based on a context vector model of the predicates and role fillers of the arguments of type j between the reference translations and the MT output.",
        "Lo et al. (2012) and Tumuluru et al. (2012) described how the lexical and phrasal similarities of the semantic role fillers are computed.",
        "A subsequent variant of the aggregation function inspired by Mihalcea et al. (2006) that normalizes phrasal similarities according to the phrase length more accurately was used in more recent work (Lo et al., 2013a; Lo and Wu, 2013a; Lo et al., 2013b).",
        "In this paper, we employ a newer version of MEANT that uses f-score to aggregate individual token similarities into the composite phrasal similarities of semantic role fillers, as our experiments indicate this is more accurate than the previously used aggregation functions.",
        "Recent studies (Lo et al., 2013a; Lo and Wu, 2013a; Lo et al., 2013b) show that tuning MT systems against MEANT produces more robustly adequate translations than the common practice of tuning against BLEU or TER across different data genres, such as formal newswire text, informal web forum text and informal public speech.",
        "2.3 MT quality estimation Evaluating cross-lingual MT quality is similar to the work of MT quality estimation (QE).",
        "Broadly speaking, there are two different approaches to QE: surface-based and feature-based.",
        "Token-based QE models, such as those in Gan-drabur et al. (2006) and Ueffing and Ney (2005) fail to assess the overall MT quality because translation goodness is not a compositional property.",
        "In contrast, Blatz et al. (2004) introduced a sentence-level QE system where an arbitrary threshold is used to classify the MT output as good or bad.",
        "The fundamental problem of this approach is that it defines QE as a binary classification task rather than attempting to measure the degree of goodness of the MT output.",
        "To address this problem, Quirk (2004) related the sentence-level correctness of the QE model to human judgment and achieved a high correlation with human judgement for a small annotated corpus; however, the proposed model does not scale well to larger data sets.",
        "Feature-based QE models (Xiong et al., 2010; He et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2011; Specia, 2011; Avramidis, 2012; Mehdad et al., 2012; Almaghout and Specia, 2013; Avramidis and Popovi?c, 2013; Shah et al., 2013) throw a wide range of linguistic and non-linguistic features into machine learn-767 Figure 3: Cross-lingual XMEANT algorithm.",
        "ing algorithms for predicting MT quality.",
        "Although the feature-based QE system of Avramidis and Popovi?c (2013) slightly outperformed METEOR on correlation with human adequacy judg-ment, these ?black box?",
        "approaches typically lack representational transparency, require expensive running time, and/or must be discriminatively retrained for each language and text type.",
        "3 XMEANT: a cross-lingual MEANT Like MEANT, XMEANT aims to evaluate how well MT preserves the core semantics, while maintaining full representational transparency.",
        "But whereas MEANT measures lexical similarity using a monolingual context vector model, XMEANT instead substitutes simple cross-lingual lexical translation probabilities.",
        "XMEANT differs only minimally from MEANT, as underlined in figure 3.",
        "The same weights obtained by optimizing MEANT against human adequacy judgement were used for XMEANT.",
        "The weights can also be estimated in unsupervised fashion using the relative frequency of each semantic role label in the foreign input, as in UMEANT.",
        "To aggregate individual lexical translation probabilities into phrasal similarities between cross-lingual semantic role fillers, we compared two natural approaches to generalizing MEANT's method of comparing semantic parses, as described below.",
        "3.1 Applying MEANT's f-score within semantic role fillers The first natural approach is to extend MEANT's f-score based method of aggregating semantic parse accuracy, so as to also apply to aggregating lexical translation probabilities within semantic role filler phrases.",
        "However, since we are missing structure information within the flat role filler phrases, we can no longer assume an injective mapping for aligning the tokens of the role fillers between the foreign input and the MT output.",
        "We therefore relax the assumption and thus for cross-lingual phrasal precision/recall, we align each token of the role fillers in the output/input string to the token of the role fillers in the input/output string that has the maximum lexical translation probability.",
        "The precise definition of the cross-lingual phrasal similarities is as follows: e i,pred ?",
        "the output side of the pred of aligned frame i f i,pred ?",
        "the input side of the pred of aligned frame i e i,j ?",
        "the output side of the ARG j of aligned frame i f i,j ?",

        "prec e,f is the precision and rec e,f is the recall of the phrasal similarities of the role fillers.",
        "s i,pred and s i,j are the f-scores of the phrasal similarities of the predicates and role fillers of the arguments of type j between the input and the MT output.",
        "3.2 Applying MEANT's ITG bias within semantic role fillers The second natural approach is to extend MEANT's ITG bias on compositional reorder-ing, so as to also apply to aggregating lexical translation probabilities within semantic role filler phrases.",
        "Addanki et al. (2012) showed empirically that cross-lingual semantic role reordering of the kind that MEANT is based upon is fully covered within ITG constraints.",
        "In Wu et al. (2014), we extend ITG constraints into aligning the tokens within the semantic role fillers within monolingual MEANT, thus replacing its previous monolingual phrasal aggregation heuristic.",
        "Here we borrow the 768 idea for the cross-lingual case, using the length-normalized inside probability at the root of a BITG biparse (Wu, 1997; Zens and Ney, 2003; Saers and Wu, 2009) as follows: G ?",

        "4 Results Table 1 shows that for human adequacy judgments at the sentence level, the f-score based XMEANT (1) correlates significantly more closely than other commonly used monolingual automatic MT evaluation metrics, and (2) even correlates nearly as well as monolingual MEANT.",
        "This suggests that the semantic structure of the MT output is indeed closer to that of the input sentence than that of the reference translation.",
        "Furthermore, the ITG-based XMEANT (1) significantly outperforms MEANT, and (2) is an automatic metric that is nearly as accurate as the HMEANT human subjective version.",
        "This indicates that BITG constraints indeed provide a more robust token alignment compared to the heuristics previously employed in MEANT.",
        "It is also consistent with results observed while estimating word alignment probabilities, where BITG constraints outperformed alignments from GIZA++ (Saers and Wu, 2009).",

        "This is (1) accomplished by replacing monolingual MEANT's context vector model with simple translation probabilities when computing similarities of semantic role fillers, and (2) further improved by incorporating BITG constraints for aligning the tokens in semantic role fillers.",
