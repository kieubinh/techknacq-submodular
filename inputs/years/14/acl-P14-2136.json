        "Event extraction is an increasingly hot and challenging research topic in the natural language processing (NLP) community (Ahn, 2006; Saun et al. 2006; Zhao et al. 2008).",
        "It aims to automatically extract certain types of events with the arguments to present the texts under a structured form.",
        "In event extraction, there are four primary subtasks, named trigger identification, trigger type determination, argument identification, and argument role determination (Chen and NG, 2012).",
        "As an important technology in information extraction, event extraction could be applied to many fields such as information retrieval, summarization, text mining, and question answering.",
        "Recently, the dominative approach to event extraction is based on supervised learning where a set of labeled samples are exploited to train a model to extract the events.",
        "However, the availa-?",
        "* Corresponding author ble labeled data are rather sparse due to various kinds of event categories.",
        "For example, the event taxonomy in ACE 2005 1 (Automatic Content Extraction) includes 8 types of events, with 33 subtypes, such as ?Marry/Life?",
        "(subtype/type), and ?Transport/Movement?.",
        "Moreover, some subtypes such as ?Nominate/Personnel?",
        "and ?Convict/Justice?",
        "contain less than 10 labeled samples in the English and Chinese corpus respectively.",
        "Apparently, such a small scale of training data is difficult to yield a satisfying performance.",
        "One possible way to alleviate the data sparseness problem in event extraction is to conduct bilingual event extraction with training data from two different languages.",
        "This is motivated by the fact that labeled data from a language is highly possible to convey similar information in another language.",
        "For example, E1 is an event sample from the English corpus and E2 is another one in the Chinese corpus.",
        "Apparently, E1 and the English translation text of E2, share some important clues such as meet and Iraq which highly indicates the event type of ?Meet/Contact?.",
        "E1: Bush arrived in Saint Petersburg on Sat-urday, when he also briefly met German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, whose opposition to the Iraq war had soured his relationship with Wash-ington, at a dinner hosted by Putin.",
        "E2: ?????????????????",
        "????",
        "???????????????",
        "????(U.S.",
        "president George W. Bush will visit Germany in February and meet with Schroeder, Iran and Iraq will be the focus of the talks the two sides.)",
        "In this paper, we address the data sparseness problem in event extraction with a bilingual pro-1http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/ace/2005 842 cessing approach which aims to exploit bilingual training data to enhance the extraction performance in each language.",
        "As a preliminary work, we mainly focus on the subtask of trigger type determination.",
        "Accordingly, our goal is to design a classifier which is trained with labeled data from two different languages and is capable of classifying the test data from both languages.",
        "Generally, this task possesses two main challenges.",
        "The first challenge is text representation, namely, how to eliminate the language gap between the two languages.",
        "To tackle this, we first employ Google Translate2, a state-of-the-art machine translation system, to gain the translation of an event instance, similar to what has been widely done by previous studies in bilingual classification tasks e.g., Wan (2008); Then, we uniformly represent each text with bilingual word features.",
        "That is, we augment each original feature vector into a novel one which contains the translated features.",
        "The second challenge is the translation for some specific features.",
        "It is well-known that some specific features, such as the triggers and their context features, are extremely important for determining the event types.",
        "For example, in E3, both trigger ?left?",
        "and named entity ?Sad- dam?",
        "are important features to tell the event type, i.e., \"Transport/Movement\".",
        "When it is translated to Chinese, it is also required to know trigger ??",
        "??",
        "(left) and named entity ?????",
        "(Saddam) in E4, the Chinese translation of E3.",
        "E3: Saddam's clan is said to have left for a small village in the desert.",
        "E4: Chinese translation: ?",
        "?",
        "?",
        "?",
        "?",
        "(Saddam) ??",

        "?",
        "?",
        "??",
        "?",
        "???",
        "However, it is normally difficult to know which words are the triggers and surrounding entities in the translated sentence.",
        "To tackle this issue, we propose to locate the trigger from both monolingual and bilingual perspectives in the translation text.",
        "Empirical studies demonstrate that adding the translation of these specific features substantially improves the classification performance.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 overviews the related work on event extraction.",

        "Section 4 gives the experimental studies.",
        "In Section 5, we conclude our work and give some future work.",
        "2 Related Work In the NLP community, event extraction has been mainly studied in both English and Chinese.",
        "In English, various supervised learning approaches have been explored recently.",
        "Bethard and Martin (2006) formulate the event identification as a classification problem in a word-chunking paradigm, introducing a variety of linguistically motivated features.",
        "Ahn (2006) proposes a trigger-based method.",
        "It first identifies the trigger in an event, and then uses a multi-classifier to implement trigger type determination.",
        "Ji and Grishman (2008) employ an approach to propagate consistent event arguments across sentences and documents.",
        "Liao and Grishman (2010) apply document level information to improve the performance of event extraction.",
        "Hong et al. (2011) leverage cross-entity information to improve traditional event extrac-tion, regarding entity type consistency as a key feature.",
        "More recently, Li et al. (2013) propose a joint framework based on structured prediction which extracts triggers and arguments together.",
        "In Chinese, relevant studies in event extraction are in a relatively primary stage with focus on more special characteristics and challenges.",
        "Tan et al. (2008) employ local feature selection and explicit discrimination of positive and negative features to ensure the performance of trigger type determination.",
        "Chen and Ji (2009) apply lexical, syntactic and semantic features in trigger labeling and argument labeling to improve the performance.",
        "More recently, Li et al. (2012) and Li et al. (2013) introduce two inference mechanisms to infer unknown triggers and recover trigger mentions respectively with morphological structures.",
        "In comparison with above studies, we focus on bilingual event extraction.",
        "Although bilingual classification has been paid lots of attention in other fields (Wan 2008; Haghighi et al., 2008; Ismail et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2011?Li et al., 2013), there is few related work in event extraction.",
        "The only one related work we find is Ji (2009) which proposes an inductive learning approach to exploit cross-lingual predicate clusters to improve the event extraction task with the main goal to get the event taggers from extra re-sources, i.e., an English and Chinese parallel corpus.",
        "Differently, our goal is to make the la-843 beled data from two languages help each other without any other extra resources, which is original in the study of event extraction.",
        "3 The Proposed Approach Trigger type determination aims to determine the event type of a trigger given the trigger and its context (e.g., a sentence).",
        "Existing approaches to trigger type determination mainly focus on monolingual classification.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the framework for Chinese and English.",
        "In comparison, our approach exploits the corpora from two different languages.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates the framework.",
        "As shown in the figure, we first get the translated corpora of Chinese and English origin corpora through machine translation.",
        "Then, we represent each text with bilingual features, which enables us to merge the training data from both languages so as to make them help each other.",

        "In this approach, the extracted features are the key components to make a successful classifier.",
