        "Understanding relations is important in entity tasks.",
        "In this paper, we illustrate such importance using named entity (NE) translation mining problem.",
        "Early research on NE translation used phonetic similarities, for example, to mine the translation ?Mandelson????????",
        "[ManDeErSen] with similar sounds (Knight and Graehl, 1998; Wan and Verspoor, 1998).",
        "However, not all NE translations are based on transliterations, but they might be based on semantics (e.g., ?WTO????",
        "????",
        "[ShiMaoZuZhi]), or even arbitrary (e.g., ?Jackie Chan??????[ChengLong]).",
        "To address this challenge, current state-of-the-art approaches build an entity graph for each language corpus, and align the two graphs by propagating the seed translation similarities (Figure 1) (Kim et al., 2011; You et al., 2012).",
        "For exam-ple, arbitrary translation pair such as (Jackie Chan, ??)",
        "can be obtained, if he is connected to his film ?DrunkenMaster?",
        "(??)",
        "in both graphs.",
        "That is, we can propagate the seed translation similarity of (Drunken Master,??)",
        "to neighbor entities ?Jackie Chan?",
        "and ????",
        "in each graph.",
        "??",
        "(Drunken Master) ??",
        "(Kung Fu) ??",
        "(Hong Kong) ??",
        "(Jackie Chan) Drunken Master Kung Fu Hong Kong Jackie Chan English Entity Graph Chinese Entity Graph Known translations Propagated translations Figure 1: Entity translation by propagation.",
        "When two graphs are obtained from parallel corpora, graphs are symmetric and ?blind prop-agation?",
        "described above is effective.",
        "In con-trast, Lee and Hwang (2013) propose ?selective propagation?",
        "for asymmetric graphs, of comparing the semantics of relations.",
        "A key contribution of this paper is using relation temporality for determining relation equivalence.",
        "Existing work (Nakashole et al., 2012; Mohamed et al., 2011; Lee and Hwang, 2013) uses only co-occurring entity pairs, or explicit features (EF).",
        "For example, for a relation pay an official visit to, with a statement (Bush, pay an official visit to, China), an entity pair (Bush, China) is in the ?support set?, which is a set of co-occurring entity pairs of pay an official visit to.",
        "When its support set is {(Bush, China), (Mandelson, Moscow), (Rice, Is-rael)}, and that of visit is {(Bush, China), (Rice, Israel), (Medvedev, Cuba)}, we can infer their semantic equivalence based on the set intersection: {(Bush, China), (Rice, Israel)}.",
        "In contrast, we propose to explore corpus latent features (LF), to complement the sparsity problem of EF: Out of 158 randomly chosen correct relation translation pairs we labeled, 64% has only one co-occurring entity pair, which makes EF not very effective to identify these relation translations.",
        "Therefore, we leverage relation temporality, which is both orthogonal and complementary to existing efforts leveraging entity temporality (Kle- 848 mentiev and Roth, 2006; Kim et al., 2012; You et al., 2013).",
        "In particular, we discover three new challenges on using temporality for relation understanding in comparable corpora, which we discuss in detail in Section 3.2.",
        "Based on these challenges, we identify three new features for LF.",
        "We observe the complementary nature of EF and LF, then propose a hybrid approach combining both features.",
        "Our new hybrid approach significantly improves the relation translation (0.16 higher F1-score than EF), and in turn improves the entity translation (0.02 higher F1-score).",
        "2 Preliminary: Entity Translation by Selective Propagation Selective propagation, leveraging the statements extracted from bilingual comparable corpora, can be summarized by several steps.",
        "STEP 1 Initialize entity translation function T (0) N .",
        "STEP 2 Build relation translation function T (t) R using T (t) N .",
        "STEP 3 Update entity translation function to acquire T (t+1) N using T (t) R .",
        "STEP 4 Repeat STEP 2 and STEP 3.",
        "For STEP 1, an existing method for entity translation is adopted.",
        "In our experiments, we use a non-selective (hence not requiring relation trans-lations) propagation approach (You et al., 2012) with (Lam et al., 2007) for a base translation matrix.",
        "The focus of this paper is STEP 2, building the translation score T (t) R (r E , r C ) of English relation r E and Chinese relation r C : We will discuss the detailed procedure of STEP 2 and propose how to improve it in Section 3.",
        "STEP 3 is the stage that selective propagation takes place.",
        "STEP 2 and STEP 3 reinforce each other to improve the final entity translation function.",
        "While STEP 3 is well-defined in (Lee and Hwang, 2013), to propagate entity translation scores when the relation semantics of the edges are equivalent, STEP 2 has been restricted to the explicit feature, i.e., co-occurring entities or shared context.",
        "In clear con-trast, by discovering novel latent features based on temporal properties, we can increase the accuracy of both entity and relation translations.",
        "Note that we omit t for readability in the following sections.",
        "3 Relation Translation In this section, we present our approaches to obtain relations of equivalent semantics across languages (e.g., visit???).",
        "Formally, our goal is to build the relation translation score function T R (r E , r C ) for English relation r E and Chinese relation r C .",
        "3.1 Baseline: Explicit Feature Approach (EF) In this section, we briefly illustrate a baseline method EF (Lee and Hwang, 2013).",
        "As we mentioned in the introduction, traditional approaches leverage common co-occurring entity-pairs.",
        "This observation also holds in the bilingual environment by exploiting seed entity translations.",
        "For example, let us say that we have two extracted statements: (Bruce Willis, star in, The Sixth Sense) and (???????",
        "(Bruce Willis),??",
        "(star in),???",
        "(The Sixth Sense)).",
        "Knowing a few seed entity translations using T N , ?Bruce Willis???????????",
        "and ?The Sixth Sense??????",
        "?, we can find star in and??",
        "are semantically similar.",
        "Specifically, we quantify this similarity based on the number of such common entity pairs that we denote as |H(r E , r C )| for an English relation r E and a Chinese relation r C .",
        "The existing approaches are variations of using |H(r E , r C )|.",
        "Our baseline implementation uses the one by (Lee and Hwang, 2013), and we refer the reader to the paper for formal definitions and processing steps we omitted due to the page limit.",
        "Unfortunately, this approach suffers from sparsity of the common entity pairs due to the incomparability of the corpora and those entities that cannot be translated by T N .",
        "Therefore, we leverage corpus latent features as an additional signal to overcome this problem.",
        "3.2 Latent Feature Approach (LF) Temporal Feature Discovery We exploit the temporal distribution d[x](t) of textual element x during t-th week in statements; we count the occurrences of the element x on a weekly basis, and normalize them to observe ?",

        "and d[?, r, e] to measure the relation translation scores and leverage the average score.",
