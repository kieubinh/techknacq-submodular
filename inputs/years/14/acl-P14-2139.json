        "Mining opinions from text by identifying their positive and negative polarities is an important task and supervised learning methods have been quite successful.",
        "However, supervised methods require labeled samples for modeling and the lack of sufficient training data is the performance bottle-neck in opinion analysis especially for resource scarce languages.",
        "To solve this problem, the transfer leaning method (Arnold et al., 2007) have been used to make use of samples from a resource rich source language to a resource scarce target language, also known as cross language opinion analysis (CLOA).",
        "In transductive transfer learning (TTL) where the source language has labeled data and the target language has only unlabeled data, an algorithm needs to select samples from the unlabeled target language as the training data and assign them with class labels using some estimated confidence.",
        "These labeled samples in the target lan-guage, referred to as the transferred samples, also have a probability of being misclassified.",
        "During training iterations, the misclassification introduces class noise which accumulates, resulting in a so called negative transfer that affects the classification performance.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel method aimed at reducing class noise for TTL in CLOA.",
        "The basic idea is to utilize transferred samples with high quality to identify those negative transfers and remove them as class noise to reduce noise accumulation in future training iterations.",
        "Evaluations on NLP&CC 2013 CLOA evaluation data set show that our algorithm achieves the best result, outperforming the current state-of-the-art systems.",
        "More significantly, our system shows a monotonic increasing trend in performance when more training data are used beating the performance degradation curse of most transfer learning methods when training data reaches certain size.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 introduces related works in transfer learning, cross lingual opinion analysis, and class noise detection technology.",
        "Section 3 presents our algorithm.",
        "Section 4 gives performance evaluation.",
        "Section 5 concludes this paper.",
        "2 Related works TTL has been widely used before the formal concept and definition of TTL was given in (Ar- nold, 2007).",
        "Wan introduced the co-training method into cross-lingual opinion analysis (Wan, 2009; Zhou et al., 2011), and Aue et al. introduced transfer learning into cross domain analysis (Aue, 2005) which solves similar problems.",
        "In this paper, we will use the terms source language and target language to refer to all cross lingual/domain analysis.",
        "Traditionally, transfer learning methods focus on how to estimate the confidence score of transferred samples in the target language or domain (Blitzer et al., 2006, Huang et al., 2007; Sugiya-ma et al., 2008, Chen et al., 2011, Lu et al., 2011).",
        "In some tasks, researchers utilize NLP tools such as alignment to reduce the bias towards that of 860 the source language in transfer learning (Meng et al., 2012).",
        "However, detecting misclassification in transferred samples (referred to as class noise) and reducing negative transfers are still an unresolved problem.",
        "There are two basic methods for class noise detection in machine learning.",
        "The first is the classification based method (Brodley and Friedl, 1999; Zhu et al., 2003; Zhu 2004; Sluban et al., 2010) and the second is the graph based method (Zighed et al., 2002; Muhlenbach et al., 2004; Jiang and Zhou, 2004).",
        "Class noise detection can also be applied to semi-supervised learning because noise can accumulate in iterations too.",
        "Li employed Zighed's cut edge weight statistic method in self-training (Li and Zhou, 2005) and co-training (Li and Zhou, 2011).",
        "Chao used Li's method in tri-training (Chao et al., 2008).",
        "(Fuku- moto et al., 2013) used the support vectors to detect class noise in semi-supervised learning.",
        "In TTL, however, training and testing samples cannot be assumed to have the same distributions.",
        "Thus, noise detection methods used in semi-supervised learning are not directly suited in TTL.",
        "Y. Cheng has tried to use semi-supervised method (Jiang and Zhou, 2004) in transfer learning (Cheng and Li, 2009).",
        "His experiment showed that their approach would work when the source domain and the target domain share similar distributions.",
        "How to reduce negative transfers is still a problem in transfer learning.",
        "3 Our Approach In order to reduce negative transfers, we propose to incorporate class noise detection into TTL.",
        "The basic idea is to first select high quality labeled samples after certain iterations as indicator to detect class noise in transferred samples.",
        "We then remove noisy samples that cause negative transfers from the current accumulated training set to retain an improved set of training data for the remainder of the training phase.",
        "This negative sample reduction process can be repeated several times during transfer learning.",
        "Two questions must be answered in this approach: (1) how to measure the quality of transferred samples, and (2) how to utilize high quality labeled samples to detect class noise in training data.",
        "3.1 Estimating Testing Error To determine the quality of the transferred samples that are added iteratively in the learning process, we cannot use training error to estimate true error because the training data and the testing data have different distributions.",
        "In this work, we employ the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning theory to estimate the error boundary.",
        "According to the PAC learning theory, the least error boundary ?",
        "is determined by the size of the training set m and the class noise rate ?, bound by the following relation: ?",
        "( ) ( ) In TTL, m increases linearly, yet ?",
        "is multiplied in each iteration.",
        "This means the significance of m to performance is higher at the beginning of transfer learning and gradually slows down in later iterations.",
        "On the contrary, the influence of class noise increases.",
        "That is why performance improves initially and gradually falls to negative transfer when noise accumulation outperforms the learned information as shown in Fig.1.",
        "In TTL, transferred samples in both the training data and test data have the same distribution.",
        "This implies that we can apply the PAC theory to analyze the error boundary of the machine learning model using transferred data.",
        "Figure 1 Negative transfer in the learning process According to PAC theorem with an assumed fixed probability ?",
        "(Angluin and Laird, 1988), the least error boundary ?",
        "is given by: ?",
        "( ? )",
        "( ( ) ) ( ) where N is a constant decided by the hypothesis space.",
        "In any iteration during TTL, the hypothesis space is the same and the probability ?",
        "is fixed.",
        "Thus the least error boundary is determined by the size of the transferred sample m and the class noise of transferred samples ?.",
        "According to (2), we apply a manifold assumption based method to estimate ?.",
        "Let T be the number of iterations to serve as one period.",
        "We then estimate the least error boundary before and after each T to measure the quality of transferred samples during each T. If the least error boundary is reduced, it means that transferred samples used in this period are of high quality and can improve the performance.",
        "Otherwise, the transfer learning algorithm should stop.",
        "861 3.2 Estimating Class Noise For formula (2) to work, we need to know the class noise rate ?",
        "to calculate the error boundary.",
        "Obviously, we cannot use conditional probabilities from the training data in the source language to estimate the noise rate ?",
        "of the transferred samples because the distribution of source language is different from that of target language.",
        "Consider a KNN graph on the transferred samples using any similarity metric, for example, cosine similarity, for any two connected vertex ( )and ( ) in the graph from samples to classes, the edge weight is given by: ( ) ( ) Furthermore, a sign function for the two vertices ( )and ( ), is defined as: { ( ) According to the manifold assumption, the conditional probability ( | ) can be approximated by the frequency of ( ) which is equal to ( ).",
        "In opinion annotations, the agreement of two annotators is often no larger than 0.8.",
        "This means that for the best cases ( )=0.2.",
        "Hence follows a Bernoulli distribution with p=0.2 for the best cases in manual annotations.",
        "Let ( ) be the vertices that are connected to the vertex, the statistical magnitude of the vertex can be defined as: ?",

        "Hence we assume the class noise rate of example ( ) is: ( ) We take the general significant level of 0.05 to reject the null hypothesis.",
        "It means that if of ( ) is larger than 0.95, the sample will be considered as a class noisy sample.",

        "In our proposed approach, we establish the quality estimate period T to conduct class noise detection to estimate the class noise rate of transferred samples.",
        "Based on the average class noise we can get the least error boundary so as to tell if an added sample is of high quality.",
        "If the newly added samples are of high quality, they can be used to detect class noise in transferred training data.",
        "Otherwise, transfer learning should stop.",
