        "Human translation is created at document level, suggesting that translation of a particular sentence depends also on the ?discourse structure?.",
        "Re-cently, some MT researchers have started to explore the possibility to incorporate linguistic information outside the sentence boundary for MT, such as topical structure, coreference chains, and lexical coherence.",
        "Among various discourse struc-tures, discourse relations, also known as coherence relations, are meaningful relations connecting text segments and are crucial to the human cognitive processing as well as memory of texts (Sanders and Noordman, 2000).",
        "These relations can be explicitly marked in a text by signaling phrases or implicitly implied.",
        "Even when they are explicit, some markers are ambiguous and do not always signal the same relation.",
        "In ad-dition, strategies to represent discourse relations vary across languages.",
        "It is thus a challenging task to correctly translate discourse relations.",
        "This thesis proposal presents my plan towards building a discourse-relation-aware machine translation system translating from Chinese to English.",
        "In particular, I would like to focus on modeling the translation of implicit discourse re-lations, which has not yet been exploited to date to my knowledge, but is yet a noticeable problem since implicit discourse relations are abundant in Chinese.",
        "According to the statistics of the bilingual discourse annotation in progress, about 1/4 of the Chinese implicit DCs are translated to explicit DCs in English.",
        "A reasonable initial attempt to learn discourse-relation-aware translation rules is a knowledge-based approach based on an annotated corpus.",
        "This proposal describes my ongoing work on annotating and cross-lingually aligning discourse relations in a Chinese-English translation corpus, as well as my plans to incorporate the resulting linguistic markup into an SMT system.",
        "Motivated by the characteristics of long Chinese sentences with multiple discourse segments, a further direction of the research is to translate in units of discourse segments instead of sentences.",
        "Section 2 gives an overview of existing literature.",
        "Section 3 explains the motivations behind my research on discourse relations for MT.",
        "Section 4 describes my ongoing work of bilingual discourse annotation, followed by statistics to date .",
        "Section 5 present my plans for next steps.",
        "Finally, a conclusion is drawn in Section 6.",
        "2 Survey 2.1 English discourse processing There are a number of discourse-annotated English resources, including the ?RST Treebank?",
        "(Carlson et al., 2001) and the ?Discourse Graph-Bank?",
        "(Wolf and Gibson, 2005), which consist 18 of 385 and 135 articles respectively.",
        "Recent discourse research often make use of the large-scaled Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008).",
        "Departed from annotation using predefined discourse relations, such as ?Rhetorical Structure Theory?",
        "(Mann and Thompson, 1988), PDTB introduces a lexically-ground formalism to annotate discourse relations by identifying the discourse connectives (DCs).",
        "An example is shown in the following.",
        "Example 1: Since McDonald's menu prices rose this year, the actual decline may have been more.",
        "(PDTB 1280) ?Since?",
        "is an explicit DC taking the italic segment as the first argument (Arg1), and the bolded segment as the second argument (Arg2), which is syntactically attached to the DC.",
        "Implicit DCs are inserted by annotators between adjacent sentences of the same paragraph to represent inferred discourse relations.",
        "Each DC is annotated with defined senses classified into 3 levels of granularity.",
        "PDTB allows evaluation of English discourse parsing tasks and disambiguation tasks (Pitler and Nenkova, 2009; Lin et al., 2010), which reveal that implicit discourse relations are much harder to learn than explicit discourse relations (Pitler et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2010).",
        "For example, classification of the 4 main relation senses (temporal, con-tingency, comparison, expansion) reaches 94% accuracy for explicit relations (Pitler and Nenkova, 2009), but only range from F-scores of 20% for ?temporal?",
        "to 76% for ?expansion?",
        "relations, possibly due to unbalanced number of training instances (Pitler et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2010).",
        "2.2 Chinese discourse processing Schemes for Chinese discourse annotation have been proposed in the existing literature (Xue, 2005; Zhou and Xue, 2012) but the corresponding resource is not yet available.",
        "Zhou et al. (2012) proposed to project English discourse annotation and classification algorithms to Chinese data, but the transfer was based on automatic word alignment and machine translation results.",
        "Works in Chinese discourse parsing report F-scores of 64% in classification of inter-sentence discourse relations and 71% in 2-way classification of intra-sentence contingency and comparison relations (Huang and Chen, 2011; Huang and Chen, 2012), training on a moderately sized (81 articles) corpus and considering explicit and implicit relations collectively.",
        "Corelation between discourse relation and sentiment was also explored based on annotated data (Huang et al., 2013).",
        "2.3 Discourse relations in SMT Earlier studies of discourse relations in MT includes Marcu et al. (2000), which proposed a discourse transfer model to re-construct the target discourse tree from the source discourse tree, parsed by the (RST).",
        "However, incorporation to an SMT system was not discussed in the work.",
        "Recent works focus on the translation of ambiguous DCs, such as ?since?",
        "in the temporal sense vs. ?since?",
        "in the reason sense.",
        "This is achieved by annotating the DCs in the training data by ?trans- lation spotting?, which is to manually align the DCs of the source text to their translation in the target text, either occurring as DCs or other expressions (Meyer et al., 2011; Popescu-Belis et al., 2012; Meyer et al., 2012; Meyer and Polakova, 2013; Cartoni et al., 2013).",
        "Experiments of these works have been conducted in English-to-French, Czech and German translation and only explicit DCs were considered.",
        "Tu et al. (2013) proposed a framework for Chinese-to-English translation, in which the source text is automatically parsed by an RST parser and translation rules are extracted from the source discourse trees aligned with the target strings.",
        "An improvement of 1.16 BLEU point is reported, considering only intra-sentential explicit relations.",
        "Meyer et al. (2012) found that the translation of DC improves by up to 10% disregarded of BLEU, which stays around the baseline system score.",
        "To detect the improvement, they used a metric known as ACT (Accuracy of Connective Transla-tion) (Hajlaoui and Popescu-Belis, 2012; Hajlaoui and Popescu-Belis, 2013), which relies on bilingual word alignment and a dictionary of DCs.",
        "In the setting, missing/additional DC (i.e. potential implicitation/explicitation of discourse relations) are to be checked manually for the validity.",
        "3 Motivation The motivation behind a discourse-relation-aware translation model for Chinese is two-fold.",
        "First of all, on top of ambiguous discourse connectives as in other languages, Chinese documents contain 19 abundant implicit connectives (Xue, 2005).",
        "In par-ticular, complex sentences often occur in the form of ?running sentences?, in which loose clauses run in a sequence separated by commas yet without explicit connectives.",
        "Such sentence structures are used to represent the temporal or reasoning order or related events, or simply to achieve consistent rhythmic patterns.",
        "In contrast, syntactical constraint is prominent in English and this kind of ?paratactic?",
        "structures only occur as occasional rhetorical measures.",
        "In other cases, relations between clauses within a sentence are marked by coordinating or subordinating conjunctions in order to maintain an intact sentence structure.",
        "Another motivation is that translation in units of sentences is not always preferable in Chinese-English translation.",
        "In fact, each comma-separated segment of a ?running sentence?",
        "can be considered as an elementary discourse units (EDU) (Yang and Xue, 2012; Zhou and Xue, 2012) and aligned across the two languages.",
        "In current SMT models, sentence splitting is the result of the language model or translation rules containing periods or sentence initial markers.",
        "A long Chinese ?running sentence?",
        "is typically translated to one English sentence with ?comma splices?",
        "(ungrammatical commas between complete sentences without connecting by conjunctions).",
        "On the other hand, discourse structure provides clues to split the source sentence.",
        "It is because some DCs only relate EDUs within the same sentences (e.g.",
        "?but?, ?because?)",
        "while some only relate with the previous sentence (e.g.",
        "?however?, -- in addition?",
        ")(Stepanov and Riccardi, 2013).",
        "Example 2 shows two versions of English translation of a Chinese sentence as output by Google Translate.",
        "Note that in the original Chinese sentence, all the DCs are omitted to achieve a quadruplet pattern.",
        "Implicit DCs, represented by glossed words in brackets, can be inserted to each comma-separated clause to signal the discourse relations.",
        "Without explicit DCs, the MT output (MT original) results in a sequence of broken clauses, whereas with inserted DCs (MT w/DC), the clauses are joined by the translated DCs to a complete sentence.",
        "In addition, the dropped pronoun ?you?",
        "is properly generated, potentially due to improvement in syntactical parsing of the source sentence.",
        "Example 2 Source: (??-if)?????????",
        "(?- then)??????(??-but)?????(?",
        "?- furthermore)?????(?-and)?????",
        "MT original: Difficult to pay taxes, may suspend arrears, the new tex is not owed, penalties linked tax free, paid annually.",
        "MTw/DC: If you have difficulty to pay taxes, you can suspend the arrears, but the new tax is not owed and taxes linked to impunity and paid annually.",
        "Ref: Those having difficulty paying taxes can temporarily postponing old debt but not owing on new taxes, and suspending taxes and waiving fines, and paying off year by year.",
        "(adapted from Chinese Tree Bank Art.89) 4 Work in progress: Cross-lingual annotation of discourse relations Towards building a statistical machine translation system that tackles discourse relations specifically, I started manually annotating a Chinese-English translation corpus with discourse relations.",
        "The purpose of annotation is not only to create data but also to understand the problems in Chinese discourse processing and translation.",
        "The completed annotation is planned to be released.",
        "Comparing with representation of discourse relations by analytical definitions, the PDTB-styled association of discourse relations to lexical connectives is more compatible to the procedures of statistical machine translation.",
        "Therefore, the PDTB convention is adopted for the annotation of connectives on both sides of the parallel corpus.",
        "Instead of sense annotation, the DCs are aligned in similar manner as the ?translation spotting?",
        "approach (Meyer et al., 2011; Popescu-Belis et al., 2012; Cartoni et al., 2013).",
        "In other words, the ?senses?",
        "are disambiguated by the translation of the DCs.",
        "The data used is the English Chinese Translation Treebank (Bies et al., 2007), which consists of 325 Chinese news stories translated into 146,300 words of English.",
        "Adaptations made to capture the cross-lingual difference in discourse relations are explained in the following.",
        "4.1 EDU segmented by punctuations In the PDTB, the span of each EDU (Arg1 or Arg2), which can range from a single noun to multiple sentences, are manually annotated.",
        "While 20 each WSJ paragraph 1 contains three sentences on average, the typical ?running sentences?",
        "in Chinese are exceptionally long.",
        "It is hard for annotators to agree on an EDU span, and neither does it have direct effect on the DC translation.",
        "Therefore, I follow previous works (Yang and Xue, 2012; Zhou and Xue, 2012) and consider a segment separated by Chinese punctuations, especially commas, as the span of an EDU.",
        "Nonetheless, there are exceptions since Chinese commas are used arbitrarily to signify ?pauses?",
        "in the sentence.",
        "Three original tags are defined to annotate the exceptions: ?ATTribution?",
        ", ?initialized ADVerbial?, and ?OPTional comma?",
        "(refer to Table 1).",
        "These are designed for training of automatic EDU segmentation.",
        "4.2 Explicit DCs After recognizing a valid EDU on the source text, explicit DC(s) in the EDU are tagged ?EXP?",
        "and aligned to their translation on the target side, which are not necessarily explicit DCs.",
        "In contrast with the defined list of subordinating con-junctions, coordinating conjunctions and adver-bials, DCs are not limited to any syntactical categories in this scheme so as to improve the coverage of cross-lingual annotation.",
        "For example, ?at the same time?",
        "and -- in spite of the fact that?",
        "are annotated as DC instances, since they function as the DCs ?simultaneously?",
        "and ?although?",
        "respectively, independent of context.",
        "In addition, conjunctions between VP construc-tions, which are not annotated in the PDTB, are also annotated as explicit DCs.",
        "It is because subjects are often dropped in Chinese and many EDUs will be ignored if VP constructions are excluded.",
        "4.3 Discourse markers alternative to DCs Discourse relations can be explicitly marked by non-DC expressions that are context dependent.",
        "Following the PDTB scheme, the ?ALTLex?",
        "tag is used to annotate such alternative lexicalization of discourse relations.",
        "However, with a loose definition of DC, few alternative expressions are identified.",
        "Therefore, the ?ALT?",
        "tag is defined only on the English side, which particularly serves to mark non-DC translation of Chinese DCs.",
        "Typi-cally, English prepositions are tagged ?ALT?",
        "and aligned to Chinese DCs that do not correspond with any English DCs.",
        "For example, ?",
        "???",
        "is 1 A paragraph is considered an independent document in the PDTB.",
        "This annotation scheme follows this assumption.",
        "a common DC for the ?method?",
        "relation, yet there is not a DC for this relation in English and thus it is often translated to ?by?",
        "or ?through?.",
        "4.4 Categorization of DCs It is observed that subtly different DCs need not be distinguished for translation, thus they are annotated as variations of a same DC.",
        "For exam-ple, explicit occurrences of -- in addition?, ?addi- tionally?, ?moreover?, ?furthermore?",
        "and ?besides?, all listed as distinct DCs in PDTB, are annotated as instances of -- in addition?, and ???",
        "?, ???",
        "?, ?",
        "??",
        "?, ?",
        "???",
        "as instances of ?",
        "???",
        "(literally ?but?).",
        "An unambiguous DC is used to represent the DC type, such as ?since?",
        "as an instance of ?be- cause?",
        "but not the reverse.",
        "Assigning DCs variations to an unambiguous type can serve as sense annotation without an abstract taxonomy of senses.",
        "External DC lexicon can also be flexibly added by registering new DC entries to existing categories.",
        "On the other hand, DCs that are not interchangeable in the syntactical context, such as ?but?",
        "and ?however?, are treated as distinct DC types in order to deduce discriminative translation rules.",
        "4.5 Implicit DCs In order to produce translation rules for all discourse relations, including the unmarked ones, implicit DCs (IMP) are inserted after all explicit DCs are identified in the Chinese EDU.",
        "A corresponding implicit DC is also inserted, if possible, as translation of a Chinese DC (explicit or implicit) when explicit translation is not identified.",
        "Note that implicit DCs are always annotated by a DC type instead of a variation to avoid ambiguity.",
        "The IMP tag is used to annotate parallel DC structures in Chinese.",
        "Most Chinese discourse relations are marked by ?parallel DCs?, which are similar to English patterns such as ?either...or?, ?if...then?, ?not only...but also?.",
        "However, one or both DCs in the parallel structure can be dropped in Chinese.",
        "The dropped DCs are inserted as IMP and aligned to the English side.",
        "After the first round of the annotation, another annotator is to repeat the annotation with the set of DCs recognized by the first annotator.",
        "Since implicit discourse relations lack lexical signals, the annotator agreement is lower (72% for English (Miltsakaki et al., 2004)).",
        "I plan to include implicit DC annotations of both annotators as multiple readings or coexisting DCs of the implicit re-lations, thus multiplying the training instances.",
        "21 4.6 Redundancy Usually, two EDUs are related by one DC in En-glish, thus only one of the Chinese parallel DCs is translated to explicitly.",
        "To learn this translation rule, the untranslated DC is thus aligned to a?REDundant?",
        "tag attached to the corresponding English EDU.",
        "To mark Chinese DCs that always occur independently rather than in parallel struc-ture, the EDU without a DC is also annotated as ?RED?.",
        "The various types of tags for DC annotation are summarized in Table 1.",
        "Tags for aligned ?DC?",
        "Chinese English EXP EXP explicit DC identified IMP IMP implicit DC insertable ALT expressions alternative to DC RED RED ungrammatical to insert DC Tags for Non-EDU Chinese segments ATT source of attribution ADV adverbial initialized OPT optional comma for a rhythmic pause Table 1: Tags for Chi-Eng DC annotations 4.7 Primary analysis of the annotation To date, 82 articles (about 33000 English words, about 1/3 of the complete dataset) have been an-notated, giving rise to 2050 aligned discourse relations.",
        "In addition, 486 punctuation-separated segments on the Chinese side have been identified as non-EDU segments.",
        "59 DC types for Chinese and 47 for English have been identified.",
        "Chi -/- Eng EXP.",
        "ALT.",
        "IMP.",
        "RED.",
        "Total EXP.",
        "291 68 23 49 431 IMP.",
        "396 144 770 261 1561 RED.",
        "6 0 0 52 58 Total 693 212 783 362 2050 attribute - - - 211 optional - - - 89 adverbial - - - 186 Total - - - 486 Table 2: Distribution of alignment between different ?DC?",
        "types The distribution of alignments between these types is shown in Table 2.",
        "Although the statistics are not directly comparable to other existing data due to difference in definitions, it agrees with previous findings that implicit DCs are abundant in Chinese (Zhou and Xue, 2012).",
        "According to the present data, about 1/4 of the implicit DCs are translated to explicit DCs in English.",
        "However, more than half are not explicitly translated (im- plicit or redundant).",
        "This suggests that implicit DC recovery can be focused on the those that are likely to be translated explicitly.",
        "It is also observable that explicit Chinese DCs are mostly translated to an explicit DC in English, while about 1/6 of them are translated to non-DC expressions.",
        "As mentioned, these are mostly prepositions corresponding to discourse relations that are not defined by any DCs in English.",
        "This suggests that bilingual discourse annotation can recover a larger variation of universal discourse relations than monolingual annotation.",
        "Further exploratory analysis will be conducted to investigate the tendency in discourse relation markedness and alignment, so as to define informative linguistic features for model training.",
        "Currently, I am using the MAE annotation tool(Stubbs, 2011).",
        "The annotation effort can be lightened by developing an interface that assists the multilingual annotation task by, for example, automatic EDU segmentation (to be reviewed by annotators) and automatic identification and pre-alignment of DCs based on a DC dictionary.",
        "5 Future plans The key of this research is to integrate the annotated discourse knowledge into an SMT system.",
        "Integration of document level parse to MT, as described in Marcu et al. (2000) for Japanese-to-English translation, is complicated.",
        "In addi-tion, comparing with Japanese, the word order in Chinese and English are not drastically different.",
        "Therefore, I plan to make use of information from DC-based shallow discourse parse.",
        "My main tasks towards this system include: 1.",
        "Cross-lingual DC annotation 2.",
        "EDU segmentation 3.",
        "Prediction of source implicit DCs 4.",
        "Integration to SMT system 5.",
        "DC-aware MT evaluation A flowchart of these tasks is shown in Figure 1 and explained in the following.",
        "5.1 EDU segmentation Discourse parsing can be divided to the tasks of DC identification and argument identification, 22 Figure 1: Main tasks for proposed DC-aware SMT system.",
        "where the latter can be further divided into argument position and argument span identification.",
        "In Chinese, a punctuation-separated segment is basically considered an EDU, so the span is fixed.",
        "The exceptional cases of commas not segmenting an EDU are annotated in the dataset and can be predicted in a binary classification task using lexical and syntactical features, as in Yang and Xue (2012).",
        "On the other hand, a text segment can contain more than one EDU when there are multiple DCs, thus further segmentation is necessary depending on DC identification.",
        "5.2 Prediction of source implicit DCs One focus of this research is to explicitize implicit Chinese DCs when translating to English.",
        "I plan to construct a model to predict implicit discourse relations in the Chinese source text.",
        "Previous works on Chinese discourse relation recognitions (Yue, 2006; Huang and Chen, 2011) provide insights on the prediction task and the DC annotated corpus provides data for supervised training.",
        "Although state-of-the-art implicit discourse parsing is still of low accuracy, the preciseness can be adjusted to suit the goal of machine translation.",
        "As in other joint tasks with MT, such as Bouamor et al. (2013), features of whether the implicit DC can be translated explicitly, or correctly, can in incorporated to the prediction task, so as to predict translatable implicit DCs in particular.",
        "5.3 Integration to SMT system One way to exploit discourse knowledge into an SMT system is to incorporate the predicted discourse features, such as implicit DC, DC sequence or DC type, into a factored translation model (Koehn and Hoang, 2007).",
        "Another approach is to decorate identified and predicted DCs in a syntactical parsed tree, so as to enrich the tree-to-string rules with DC markedness features.",
        "Moreover, when a source DC is translated to a sentence initial DC, a source sentence is potentially split to multiple target sentences.",
        "A document level decoder (Hardmeier et al., 2012) that searches beyond the sentence boundary is thus preferred.",
        "5.4 DC-aware MT evaluation Comparable evaluation is essential for MT re-search, yet conventional MT metrics, such as BLEU, is not effective in detecting improvement in discourse relation translation (Meyer et al., 2012).",
        "One direction is to extend the ACT metrics (Hajlaoui and Popescu-Belis, 2013) to access also translation of implicit DCs.",
        "Another direction is to define a measure that is not reference-dependent, since implicit relations can be translated in various ways.",
        "Moreover, conventional MT metrics, which compare a candidate with the reference sentence-by-sentence, have to be modified when used to access the overall MT performance of the proposed system, since the output sentences may not align with the reference sentences one-by-one.",
        "6 Conclusion In this thesis proposal, ongoing work and future plans have been presented towards a discourse-relation-aware SMT system.",
        "The research can serve as basis for the goal of a document-level MT system that considers various discourse structures.",
