        "Probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) underlie most of the high-performance parsers (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Zhang and Clark, 2009; Chen and Kit, 2012; Zhang et al., 2013).",
        "However, a naive PCFG which simply takes the empirical rules and probabilities off of a Treebank does not perform well (Klein and Manning, 2003; Levy and Man-ning, 2003; Bansal and Klein, 2012), because its context-freedom assumptions are too strong in some cases (e.g. it assumes that subject and object NPs share the same distribution).",
        "Therefore, a variety of techniques have been developed to enrich PCFG (Klein and Manning, 2005; Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Zhang and Clark, 2011; Shindo et al., 2012).",
        "Hierarchical state-split approach (Petrov et al., 2006; Petrov and Klein, 2007; Petrov and Klein, 2008a; Petrov and Klein, 2008b; Petrov, 2009) refines and generalizes the original grammars in a data-driven manner, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.",
        "Starting from a completely markovized X-Bar grammar, each category is split into two subcategories.",
        "EM is initialized with this starting point and used to climb the highly non-convex objective function of computing the joint likelihood of the observed parse trees.",
        "Then a merging step applies a likelihood ratio test to reverse the least useful half part of the splits.",
        "Learning proceeds by iterating between those two steps for six rounds.",
        "Spectral learning of latent-variable PCFGs (Cohen et al., 2012; Bailly et al., ; Cohen et al., 2013b; Cohen et al., 2013a) is another effective manner of state-split approach that provides accurate and consistent parameter estimates.",
        "However, this two complete data-driven approaches are likely to be hindered by the over-fitting issue.",
        "Incorporating knowledge (Zhang et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2011) to refine the categories in training a parser has been proved to remedy the weaknesses of probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG).",
        "The knowledge contains content words semantic resources base (Fujita et al., 2010; Agirre et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2009), named entity cues (Li et al., 2013) and so on.",

        "In order to constrain the automatic subcategory refinement, we firstly establish the mapping between the automatic clustered subcategories and the predefined subcategories.",
        "Then we employ a knowledge criterion to supervise the hierarchical splitting of these subordinating conjunction subcategories by the automatic state-split approach, which can alleviate over-fitting.",
        "The experiments are carried out on Penn Chinese Treebank and Tsinghua Treebank, which verify that the refined grammars with refined subordinating conjunction categories can improve parsing performance significantly.",

        "The existing resources for computational linguistic, like HowNet (Dong and Dong, 2003) and Cilin (Mei et al., 1983), have classified all subordinating conjunctions as one category, which is too coarse to capture the syntactic implication.",

        "At the beginning, we produce a good starting annotation with the top subcategories in the hierarchical subcategories, which is of great use to constraining the automatic splitting process.",
        "As demonstrated in Figure 4, our parser is trained on the good initialization with the automatic hierarchical state-split process, and gets improvements compared with the original training data.",

        "The top class is only used as the starting annotations of POS tags to reduce the search space for EM in our method.",
        "It is followed by the hierarchical state-split process to further refine the starting annotations based on the hierarchical subcategories.",
        "3.1 Mapping from Automatic Subcategories to Predefined Subcategories With the initialization proposed above, the automatically split-merge approach produces a series of refined categories for each tag.",
        "We restrict each automatically refined subcategory of subordinating conjunctions to correspond to a special node 50 Figure 3: A schematic figure for the hierarchical state-split process of the tag ?CS?.",
        "Each subcategory of this tag has its own word set, and corresponds to one layer at the appropriate level in the hierarchical subcategories.",

        "The hierarchical subcategories are employed in the hierarchical state-split process to impose restrictions on the subcategory refinement.",
        "First of all, it is necessary to establish the mapping from each subcategory in the data-driven hierarchical subcategories to the subcategory in the predefined hierarchical subcategories.",
        "We transfer the method for semantic-related labels (Lin et al., 2009) to our case here.",
        "The mapping is implemented with the word set related to each automatically refined granularity of clustered subordinating conjunctions and the node at the special level in the subcategory knowledge.",
        "The schematic in Figure 3 demonstrates this supervised splitting process for CS.",
        "The left part of this figure is the word sets of automatic clustered subcategories of the CS, which is split hierarchically.",
        "As expressed by the lines, each subcategory corresponds to one node in the right part of this figure, which is our hierarchical subcategory knowledge of subordinating conjunctions.",
        "As it is shown in Figure 3, the original tag ?CS?",
        "treats all the words it produces as its word set.",
        "Upon splitting each coarse category into two more specific subcategories, its word set is also cut into two subsets accordingly, through forcedly dividing each word in the word set into one subcategory which is most probable for this word in the lexical grammar.",
        "And each automatic refinement is mapped to the most specific subcategory (that is to say, the lowest node) that contains the entirely corresponding word set in the human-defined knowledge.",
        "On this basis, the new knowledge-based criterion is introduced to enrich and generalize these subcategories, with the purpose of fitting the refinement to the subcategory knowledge rather than the training data.",
        "3.2 Knowledge-based Criterion for Subordinating Conjunctions Refinement With the mapping between the automatic refined subcategories and the human-defined hierarchical subcategory knowledge, we could supervise the automatic state refinement by the knowledge.",
        "Instead of being merged by likelihood, a knowledge-based criterion is employed, to decide whether or not to go back to the upper layer in the hierarchical subcategories and thus remove the new subcategories of these tags.",
        "The criterion is that, we assume that the bottom layer in the hierarchical subcategories is special enough to express the distinction of the subordinating conjunctions.",
        "If the subcategories of the subordinating conjunctions has gone beyond the bottom layer, then the new split subcategories are deemed to be unnecessary and should be merged back.",
        "That is to say, once the parent layer of this new subcategory is mapped onto the most special subcategory, it should be removed immediately.",
        "As illustrated 51 Treebank Train Dataset Develop Dataset Test Dataset CTB5 Articles 1-270 Articles 400-1151, 301-325 Articles 271-300 TCT 16000 sentences 800 sentences 758 sentences Table 1: Data allocation of our experiment.",
        "in Figure 3, if the node has no hyponym, this subcategory has been specialized enough according to the knowledge, and thus the corresponding subcategory will stop splitting.",
        "By introducing a knowledge-based criterion, the issue is settled whether or not to further split subcategories from the perspective of predefined knowledge.",
        "To investigate the effectiveness of the presented approach, several experiments are conducted on both Penn Chinese Treebank and Tsinghua Treebank.",
        "They reveal that the subcategory knowledge of subordinating conjunctions is effective for parsing.",
