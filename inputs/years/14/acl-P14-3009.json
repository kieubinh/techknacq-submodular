        "Nowadays, the massive amount of information available in the form of digital media over the internet makes us seek effective ways of accessing this information.",
        "Textual documents, audio and video materials are uploaded every second.",
        "For in-stance, the number of Google's indexed web pages has exceeded 30 billion web pages in the last two years.",
        "Extraction of the needed information from a massive information pool is a challenging task.",
        "The task of skimming all the documents in their entirety before deciding which information is relevant is very time consuming.",
        "One of the well known and extensively studied methods for solving this problem is summariza-tion.",
        "Text summarization produces a short version of a document that covers the main topics in it (Mani and Hahn, 2000).",
        "It enables the reader to determine in a timely manner whether a given document satisfies his/her needs or not.",
        "A single document summarization system produces a summary of only one document whereas a multi-document summarization system produces a summary based on multiple documents on the same topic.",
        "Summarization systems can also be categorized as generic or query-based .",
        "A generic summary contains general information about particular documents.",
        "It includes any information supposed to be important and somehow linked to the topics of the document set.",
        "In contrast, a query based summary comprises information relevant to the given query.",
        "In this case, query is a rule according to which a summary is to be generated.",
        "Summarization systems can be also classified as extractive or abstractive.",
        "In extractive systems, a summary is created by selecting important sentences from a document.",
        "Here, only sentences containing information related to the main topics of the document are considered to be important.",
        "These sentences are added to the summary without any modification.",
        "On the other hand, abstractive systems can modify the existing sentences or even generate new sentences to be included in the summary.",
        "Therefore, abstractive summarization is typically more complex than extractive summa-rization.",
        "The main goal in multi-document summarization is redundancy elimination.",
        "Since the documents are related to the same topics, similar text units(passages, sentences etc.)",
        "are encountered frequently in different documents.",
        "Such text units that indicate the importance of the topics discussed within them should be detected in order to reduce the redundancy.",
        "Some of the well-known ap-64 proaches that address this problem are briefly explained in the following section.",
        "Although much work has been done to eliminate the redundancy in multi-document summa-rization, the problem is still actual and addressed in the current work as well.",
        "The current work proposes to integrate the generalized BFOS algorithm (Breiman et al., 1984) adopted by Chou et.al (1989) for pruned tree structured quantizer design with the HAC (Hierarchical Agglomerative Clus-tering) algorithm.",
        "The two main parameters (dis- tortion and rate) in the latter work are adopted to the multi-document summarization task.",
        "Distortion can be succinctly defined as the information loss in the meaning of the sentences due to their representation with other sentences.",
        "More specif-ically, in the current context, distortion contribution of a cluster is taken to be the sum of the distances between the vector representations of the sentences in the cluster and representative sentence of that cluster.",
        "Rate of a summary is defined to be the number of sentences in the sum-mary, but more precise definitions involving word or character counts are also possible.",
        "BFOS based tree pruning algorithm is applied to the tree built with the HAC algorithm.",
        "HAC algorithm is used for clustering purposes since BFOS algorithm gets tree structured data as an input.",
        "It is found that the suggested approach yields better results in terms of the ROUGE-1 Recall measure (Lin et al., 2003) when compared to 400 word extractive summaries(400E) included in DUC-2002 data set.",
        "Also, the results with the proposed method are higher than the ones obtained with the best systems of DUC-2002 in terms of sentence recall and precision(Harabagiu, 2002; Halteren, 2002).",
        "2 Related Works Term frequency (Luhn, 1958), lexical chains (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997), location of the sentences (Edmundson, 1969) and the cue phrases (Teufel et al., 1997) are used to determine the important lexical units.",
        "Goldstein et al. (2000) proposed a measure named Maximal Marginal Relevance which assigns a high priority to the passages relevant to the query and has minimal similarity to the sentences in the summary.",
        "Radev et al. (2001) developed a system called MEAD based on the centroid of the cluster.",
        "The words that are most relevant to the main topics are included in the centroid.",
        "Lin et al. designed a statistic-based summarization system (Summarist) which incorporated NLP(Natural Language Pro-cessing) and IR(Information Retrieval) methods.",
        "LSA(Latent Semantic Analysis) (Landauer et al., 1998) has also been used extensively in recent years for multi-document summarization.",
        "By applying SVD(Singular Value Decomposition) to the term-document matrix, it determines the most important topics and represents the term and documents in the reduced space (Murray et al., 2005; Steinberger and Jezek , 2004; Geiss, 2011).",
        "Rachit Arora et al. (2008) combined LDA(Latent Dirich-let Allocation) and SVD.",
        "In this approach, LDA is used to detect topics and SVD is applied to select the sentences representing these topics.",
        "Clustering of the sentences has also been used to determine the redundant information.",
        "In this approach, the sentences are first clustered.",
        "The sentences in each cluster share common information about the main topics of the documents to be summarized.",
        "Then a sentence is selected (Radev et al., 2004) or generated (McKeown et al., 1999) from each cluster that represents the sentences in the cluster.",
        "Finally, selected sentences are added to the summary until a predetermined length is exceeded (Aliguliyev, 2006; Hatzivassiloglou et al., 1999; Hatzivassiloglou et al., 2001).",
        "3 Background 3.1 Generalized BFOS Algorithm Let us assume that we have a tree T with the set of leaves ?",
        "T .",
        "Also let us denote a sub-tree of T rooted at any node of T as S. The leaves of the sub-trees may happen to be the inner nodes of T .",
        "If the root node of the sub-tree S is not identical to the root node of T and the set of leaves ?",
        "S is a sub-set of ?",
        "T then S is called a branch.",
        "But if the sub-tree S is rooted at the root node of T then S is named a pruned sub-tree of T .",
        "Function defined on the tree T and on any sub-tree S is called a tree functional.",
        "Monotonic tree functional is a class of functional where it increases or decreases depending on the tree size.",
        "In our case, tree size is the number of the nodes of T .",
        "Two main tree functionals(u1 and u2) need to be defined in the generalized BFOS algorithm.",
        "They are adapted to the problem under consideration.",
        "In regression trees, u1 is the number of the leaves and u2 is the mean squared distortion error.",
        "In TSVQ(Tree Structured Vector Quantiza-tion), u1 and u2 are the length of the code and 65 the expected distortion, respectively.",
        "In the current context, distortion(D) and rate(R) defined in the next section are used as the tree functionals u1 and u2.",
        "As shown in Chou et al., the set of distortion and rate points of the pruned sub-trees of T generate a convex hull if distortion is an increasing and rate is a decreasing function.",
        "Also it is stated that if the tree T is pruned off until the root node remains, then it is possible to generate the sub-trees which correspond to the vertices on the lower boundary of the convex hull.",
        "Thus it is sufficient to consider the sub-trees corresponding to the vertices of the boundary to trade off between rate and distortion.",

        "?D ?R may be used to locate the vertices on the lower boundary of the convex hull.",
        "?D and ?R indicate the amount of distortion increase and rate decrease when branch subtree S is pruned off.",
        "It can be shown that a step on the lower boundary can be taken by pruning off at least one branch sub-tree rooted at a particular inner node.",
        "The ?",
        "value of this sub-tree is minimal among all the other branch sub-trees rooted at various inner nodes of T , because it is a slope of the lower boundary.",
        "At each pruning iteration, the algorithm seeks the branch sub-tree rooted at an inner node with the minimal lambda and prunes it off the tree.",
        "After each pruning step, the inner node at which the pruned branch sub-tree is rooted becomes a leaf node.",
        "The pruning iterations continue until the root node remains or the pruned sub-tree meets a certain stopping criterion.",
        "4 The Proposed Summarization System In the current work, BFOS and HAC algorithm were incorporated to the multi-document summarization system.",
        "Generalized version of the BFOS algorithm discussed in the work of Chou et al. (1989) with previous applications to TSVQ, speech recognition etc.",
        "was adapted for the purpose of pruning the large tree designed by the HAC algorithm.",
        "Generalized BFOS algorithm was preferred in the current context because it is believed that the generated optimal trees yield the best trade-off between the semantic distortion and rate (the summary length in terms of number of sentences).",
        "The proposed system consists of the following stages: preprocessing, redundancy detection, redundancy elimination and the summary generation.",
        "In preprocessing stage, the source documents are represented in the vector space.",
        "Towards this end, the sentences are parsed, stemmed and a feature set is created (terms (stems or words, n-grams etc.)",
        "that occur in more than one document are extracted).",
        "The sentences of the document set are then represented by a sentence X term matrix with n columns and m rows, where n is the number of the sentences and m is the number of the terms in the feature set.",
        "TF-IDF is used to determine the values of the matrix elements.",
        "TF-IDF assigns a value according to the importance of the terms in the collection of the sentences.",
        "If the term t occurs frequently in the current document but the opposite is true for other documents then tf-idf value of t is high.",
        "TF ?",
        "IDF = TF ?",
        "log N DF (1) where TF is the term frequency, DF is the document frequency and N is the number of sentences.",
        "Term frequency is the number of the occurrences of the term in the sentence.",
        "Document frequency is the number of the sentences in which the term is found.",
        "Redundancy detection is facilitated by applying the Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering(HAC) algorithm.",
        "Initially, individual sentences are considered to be singletons in the HAC algorithm.",
        "The most similar clusters are then successively merged to form a new cluster that contains the union of the sentences in the merged clusters.",
        "At each step, a new (inner) node is created in the tree as the new cluster appears and contains all the sentences in the union of the merged clusters.",
        "HAC merge operations continue until a single cluster remains.",
        "The tree built after HAC operation is referred to as the HAC tree.",
        "The third stage is the redundancy elimination.",
        "To this end, generalized BFOS algorithm discussed previously is applied to the HAC tree.",
        "In order to adapt the generalized BFOS algorithm to the current context, distortion contribution of each cluster (node) is defined as follows: D = ?",
        "s?cluster d(rs, s) (2) where d is the distance between the representative sentence(rs) and a sentence(s) in the cluster.",
        "By definition, the distortion contribution of each leaf node of the HAC tree is zero.",

        "A branch sub-tree is removed at each pruning step of the generalized BFOS algorithm.",
        "Correspondingly, the sentences at the leaf nodes of the pruned branch subtree are eliminated.",
        "As a result, the rate decreases to the number of leaf nodes remaining after pruning.",
        "The centroid of the cluster can be used as the representative sentence of the cluster.",
        "Centroid can be constituted of the important (with TF-IDF values exceeding a threshold) words of the cluster (Radev et al., 2004) or can be generated using Natural language processing techniques (McKeown et al., 1999).",

        "parameter is used to determine the branch sub-trees that are successively pruned.",
        "In each pruning step, the branch sub-tree with minimum ?",
        "is identified to minimize the increase in total distortion(?D) per discarded sentence(?R).",
        "In accordance with the definition of rate given above, ?R is the change in the number of sentences in the summary before and after the pruning of the branch sub-tree.",
        "It also equals to the number of pruned leaf nodes, because rate equals to the number of the sentences stored in the leaf nodes of the current tree.",
        "For instance, let us assume that the number of sentences before pruning is 10 and a sub-tree A is cut off.",
        "If A has 4 leaf nodes, than 3 of them is eliminated and one is left to represent the cluster of sentences corresponding to the sub-tree A.",
        "Since 3 leaf nodes are removed and each leaf node is matched to the certain sen-tence, the current rate equals to 7.",
        "The increase in total distortion is written as ?D = D post ?D prev (3) where D prev is set equal to the sum of distortions in the leaves of the tree before pruning and D post is set equal to the sum of distortions in the leaves of the tree after pruning.",

        "At the initial step, a representative sentence is selected for each inner node and ?",
        "is determined for each inner node.",
        "At each generic pruning step, the node with the minimum lambda value is identified, the sub-tree rooted at that node is pruned, the root node of the sub-tree is converted to a leaf node.",

        "The proposed method of summarization has a few drawbacks.",
        "The main problem is that the pruning algorithm is highly dependent on the distortion measure.",
        "If the distortion measure is not defined appropriately, the representative sentence can be selected incorrectly.",
        "Another issue is the inclusion of the irrelevant sentences into the summary.",
        "This problem may occur if the sentences remaining after pruning operation are included in the summary without filtering.",

        "The depicted graph (Figure 1) shows that the proposed definitions of distortion and rate are eligible for the multi-document summarization purpose.",
        "The performance evaluation results in terms of ROUGE-1 metric suggest that the proposed system can perform better with additional improvements (combining with LSI).",
