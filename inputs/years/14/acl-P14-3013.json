        "WordNet (Fellbaum, 2010) has been used in numerous natural language processing tasks such as word sense disambiguation and information extraction with considerable success.",
        "Motivated by this success, many projects have been undertaken to build similar lexical databases for other languages.",
        "Among the large-scale projects are EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998) and BalkaNet (Tufis et al., 2004) for European languages and IndoWord-Net (Bhattacharyya, 2010) for Indian languages.",
        "Kurdish belongs to the Indo-European family of languages and is spoken in Kurdistan, a large geographical region spanning the intersections of Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and Syria (as showed in Figure 1).",
        "Kurdish is a less-resourced language for which, among other resources, no wordnet has been built yet.",
        "Despite having a large number (20 to 30 mil-lions) of native speakers (Hassanpour et al., 2012; Haig and Matras, 2002), Kurdish is among the less-resourced languages for which the only linguistic resource available on the Web is raw text (Walther and Sagot, 2010).",
        "In order to address this resource-scarceness problem, the Kurdish language processing project (KLPP 1 ) has been recently launched at University of Kurdistan.",
        "Among the the major linguistic resources that KLPP has been trying to develop is KurdNet, a 1 http://eng.uok.ac.ir/esmaili/research/klpp/en/main.htm Iran Turkey Syria Iraq Ar.",
        "Figure 1: Geographical Distribution of Kurdish Speakers WordNet-like lexical database for the Kurdish language.",
        "Earlier this year, we reported (Aliabadi et al., 2014) on our effort to build the first prototype of KurdNet.",
        "In this paper, we propose a plan to transform this preliminary version into a full-fledged and functional lexical database.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "We first (in Section 2) give a brief overview of the current state of KurdNet.",
        "Then after highlighting the main shortcomings of the current prototype in Section 3, we present our plan to transform this prototype to a full-blown lexical database for the Kurdish language in Section 4.",
        "We conclude the paper in Section 5.",
        "2 KurdNet: State-of-the-Art In our previous work (Aliabadi et al., 2014), we described the steps that we have taken to build the first prototype of KurdNet.",
        "There, we 1. highlighted the main challenges in building a wordnet for the Kurdish language (includ- ing its inherent diversity and morphological complexity), 2. built the first prototype of KurdNet, the Kurdish WordNet (see a summary below), and 94 3. conducted a set of experiments to evaluate the impact of KurdNet on Kurdish information retrieval.",
        "In the following, we first define the scope of our first prototype, then after justifying our choice of construction model, we describe KurdNet's individual elements.",
        "2.1 Scope Kurdish has two main dialects (Esmaili and Salavati, 2013): Sorani and Kurmanji.",
        "In the first prototype of KurdNet we focus only on the Sorani dialect.",
        "This is mainly due to lack of an available and reliable Kurmanji-to-English dictionary.",
        "Moreover, processing Sorani is in general more challenging than Kurmanji (Esmaili et al., 2013a).",
        "2.2 Methodology There are two well-known models for building wordnets for a language (Vossen, 1998): ?",
        "Expand: in this model, the synsets are built in correspondence with the WordNet synsets and the semantic relations are directly imported.",
        "It has been used for Italian in MultiWordNet and for Spanish in EuroWordNet.",
        "?",
        "Merge: in this model, the synsets and relations are first built independently and then they are aligned with WordNet?s.",
        "It has been the dominant model in building BalkaNet and EuroWordNet.",
        "The expand model seems less complex and guarantees the highest degree of compatibility across different wordnets.",
        "But it also has potential drawbacks.",
        "The most serious risk is that of forcing an excessive dependency on the lexical and conceptual structure of one of the languages involved, as pointed out in (Vossen, 1996).",
        "In our project, we follow the Expand model, since it can be partly automated and therefore would be faster.",
        "More precisely, we aim at creating a Kurdish translation/alignment for the Base Concepts (Vossen et al., 1998) which is a set of 5,000 essential concepts (i.e. synsets) that play a major role in the wordnets.",
        "Base Concepts (BC) is available on the Global WordNet Association (GWA)'s Web page 2 .",
        "The Entity-Relationship (ER) model for the data represented in Base Concept is shown in Figure 2.",
        "A sample synset is depicted in Figure 3.",

        "KurdNet's language-specific aspects, on the other hand, have been built using a semi-automatic approach.",
        "Below, we elaborate on the details of construction the remaining three elements.",
        "Synset Alignments: for each synset in BC, its counterpart in KurdNet is defined semi-automatically.",
        "We first use Dictio (a Sorani-English dictionary, see Section 4.2) to translate its literals (words).",
        "Having compiled the translation lists, we combine them in two different ways: (i) a maximal alignment (abbr.",
        "max) which is a superset of all lists, and (ii) a minimal alignment (abbr.",
        "min) which is a subset of non-empty lists.",

        "Usage Examples: we have taken a corpus-assisted approach to speed-up the process of providing usage examples for each aligned synset.",
        "To this end, we: (i) extract all sentences (820,203) of the Pewan corpus (Esmaili and Salavati, 2013), (ii) lemmatize the corpus to extract all the lemmas (278,873), and (iii) construct a lemma-to-sentence inverted index.",
        "In the current version of KurdNet, for each synset we build a pool of sentences by fetching the first 5 sentences of each of its literals from the inverted list.",
        "These pools will later be assessed by lexicographers to filter out non-relevant instances.",
        "In future, more sophisticated approaches can be applied (e.g., exploiting contextual information).",
        "Definitions: due to lack of proper translation tools, this element was aligned manually.",
        "We built a graphical user interface to facilitate the lexicographers?",
        "task.",
        "Table 1 shows a summary of KurdNet's statistical properties along with those of Base Concepts.",
        "The latest snapshot of KurdNet's prototype is freely accessible and can be obtained from (KLPP, 2013).",
        "Noun Verb Adjective Adverb Antonym Antonym Antonym Antonym Hyponym Troponym Similar Derived Hypernym Hypernym Relational Adj Meronym Entailment Also See Holonym Cause Attribute Table 2: WordNet Relational (Beckwith et al., 1993) 3 KurdNet: Shortcomings The current version of KurdNet is quite basic and therefore its applicability is very limited.",
        "In order to expand the usability of KurdNet, the following shortcomings must be overcome: 3.1 Incomplete Coverage of Kurdish Vocabulary KurdNet has been built as an alignment for Base Concepts and since Base Concepts contains only a small subset of English vocabulary, KurdNet's coverage is inevitably small.",
        "Furthermore, as it can be seen in Table 1, due to the limitations of the dictionaries used, not all English words in the Base Concepts (Vossen et al., 1998) have an equivalent in KurdNet.",
        "Hence the current mapping between WordNet and KurdNet is only partial.",
        "Fi-nally, the lexical idiosyncrasies between Kurdish and English should be identified and included in KurdNet.",
        "3.2 Refinement of Automatically-Generated Content Each synset must contain a comprehensive definition and a practical example.",
        "While KurdNet definitions are provided manually and therefore enjoy high quality, the actual words in each synset as well as the usage examples have been produced manually.",
        "In order to increase the reliability and correctness of KurdNets, there need to be mechanisms to refine the existing machine-generated components.",
        "3.3 Limited Support for Semantic Relation Types As shown in Table 2, there are several WordNet semantic relations for each syntactic categories.",
        "Each syntactic categories are organized to component files (Miller et al., 1993).",
        "The most important semantic relation in WordNet is Hyponymy and this relation is the only one support in KurdNet (Aliabadi et al., 2014).",
        "96 3.4 Absence of Kurmanji Synsets Kurdish is considered a bi-standard 3 language (Gautier, 1998; Hassanpour et al., 2012): the Sorani dialect written in an Arabic-based alphabet and the Kurmanji dialect written in a Latin-based alphabet.",
        "The linguistics features distinguishing these two dialects are phonolog-ical, lexical, and morphological.",
        "The important morphological differences that concern the construction of KurdNet are (MacKenzie, 1961; Haig and Matras, 2002): (i) in contrast to Sorani, Kurmanji has retained both gender (feminine v. masculine) and case opposition (absolute v. oblique) for nouns and pronouns, and (ii) while is Kurmanji passive voice is constructed using the helper verb ?hatin?, in Sorani it is created via verb morphology.",
        "As explained in Section 2, the current KurdNet prototype only covers the Sorani dialect and therefore it should be extended to include the Kurmanji dialect as well.",
        "This would require not only using similar resources to those reported in this paper, but also building a mapping system between the Sorani and Kurmanji dialects.",
        "3.5 Dictionary Imperfections Dictio, the dictionary that was used for building KurdNet, is relatively small.",
        "We have recently discovered new linguistics resources that can improve the quality of automatic translation of English words and sentences into Kurdish and vice versa (see Section 4.2).",
        "4 KurdNet: Extension Plan 4.1 Goals and Envisioned Outcomes The main objectives and expected artefacts for this proposals are the following: ?",
        "to refine the current prototype, through use of intelligent algorithms and/or manual assistance.",
        "?",
        "to winden the scope (i.e., including Kurmanji synsets), the coverage (i.e., going beyond Base Concepts) , and richness (supporting additional semantic relations) of the current version.",
        "3 Within KLPP, our focus has been on Sorani and Kurmanji which are the two most widely-spoken and closely-related dialects (Haig and Matras, 2002; Walther and Sagot, 2010).",
        "?",

        "4.3 Methodology As mentioned in Section 2, we have adopted the Expand model to build KurdNet.",
        "According to (Vossen, 1996), the MultiWordNet (MWN 11 ) model (Expand model) seems less complex and guarantees the highest degree of compatibility across different wordnets.",
        "The MWN model also has potential drawbacks.",
        "The most serious risk is that of forcing an excessive dependency on the lexical and conceptual structure of one of the languages involved, as (Vossen, 1996) points out.",
        "This risk can be considerably reduced by allowing the new wordnet to diverge, when necessary, from the PWN.",
        "Another important advantage of the MWN model is that automatic procedures can be devised to speed up both the construction of corresponding synsets and the detection of divergences between PWN and the wordnet being built.",
        "According to the Expand model, the aim is to build, whenever possible, Kurdish synsets which are synonymous (semantically correspondent) with the PWN synsets.",
        "The second strategy is based on Kurdish-to-English translations.",
        "For each sense of a Kurdish word K, we look for a PWN synset S including at least one English translation of K and a link between K and S is established (Pianta et al., 2002).",
        "For the correct alignment of Sorani and Kurmanji synsets, we propose to use three complementary approaches: ?",
        "use of English (here, Base Concepts) synsets as reference points between both dictionary-translated synsets of Sorani and Kurmanji.",

        "development of a transliteration/translation engine between Sorani and Kurmanji, that is capable of matching closely-related words and synstes.",
        "?",
        "For the cases in which, more than one or no mapping has been found, manual filtering or insertion will be used.",
        "4.4 Timing and Logistics Based on our estimates, we plan to carry out the research highlighted in this paper in the course of one-and-an-half to two years.",
        "To this end, a time-line has been prepared (see Figure 5).",
        "We believe that since the preliminary work on KurdNet (e.g., literature review, development of the first proto-type) has already been completed, most of our resources will be dedicated to designing new algorithms and system building.",
