        "Consider the English article in Figure 1.",
        "Based on the English content alone, monolingual KEA may not derive the best keyword set.",

        "Therefore, our goal is to return reasonable-sized set of keyword candidates that, at the same time, must contain essential terms in the article.",
        "We now formally state the problem that we are addressing.",
        "Problem Statement: We are given a bilingual parallel article collection of various topics from social media (e.g., TED), an article ARTe in language e, and its counterpart ARTc in language c. Our goal is to determine a set of words that are likely to contain important words of ARTe.",

        "First, we define strategies for estimating keyword preferences for words under different article topics (Section 3.2).",
        "These strategies rely on a set of article-topic pairs collected from the Web (Section 4.1), and are monolingual, language-dependent estimations.",
        "Finally, we show how BiKEA generates keyword lists for articles leveraging PageRank algorithm with word keyness and cross-lingual information (Section 3.3).",
        "3.2 Topical Keyword Preferences We attempt to estimate keyword preferences with respect to a wide range of article topics.",
        "Basically, the estimation is to calculate word significance in a domain topic.",

        "Figure 2.",
        "Outline of the process used to train BiKEA.",
        "In the first two stages of the learning process, we generate two sets of article and word information.",
        "The input to these stages is a set of articles and their domain topics.",
        "The output is a set of pairs of article ID and word in the article, e.g., (ARTe=1, we=?prosthesis?)",
        "in language e or (ARTc=1, wc=????)",

        "in e and (tpe=?disability?, wc=????)",
        "in c. Note that the topic information is shared between the involved languages, and that we confine the calculation of such word statistics in their specific language to respect language diversities and the language-specific word statistics will later interact in PageRank at run-time (See Section 3.3).",
        "The third stage estimates keyword preferences for words across articles and domain topics using aforementioned (ART,w) and (tp,w) sets.",

        "They are as follows.",

        "Pr(tp?|w)?log(Pr(tp?|w)) where a word's uncertainty in topics is used to estimate its associations with domain topics.",
