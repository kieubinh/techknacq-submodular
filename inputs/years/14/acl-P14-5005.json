        "Writing articles may be a challenging task, as we usually have trouble in finding the suitable words or suffer from lack of ideas.",
        "Thus it may be very helpful if some writing reference information, e.g., words or sentences, can be recommended while we are composing an article.",
        "On the one hand, for non-english users, e.g., Chinese, the Chinese input method is our first tool for interacting with a computer.",
        "Nowadays, the most popular Chinese input methods are Pinyin-based ones, such as Sougou Pinyin1 and Google Pinyin 2 .",
        "These systems only present accurate results of Pinyin-to-Character conversion.",
        "Considering these systems?",
        "lack of suggestions for related words, they hardly provide writers with substantial help in writing.",
        "On the other hand, try to meet the need of writing assistance, more and more systems facilitating Chinese writing have been available to the public, * Corresponding author 1 http://pinyin.sogou.com 2 http://www.google.com/intl/zh-CN/ime/pinyin such as WenXin Super Writing Assistant3 and BigWriter4, and among others.",
        "However, due to their shortcomings of building examples library manually and lack of corpus mining techniques, most of the time the suggestions made by these systems are not creative or contextual.",
        "Thus, in this paper, we present Writing with INtelligent Guidance and Suggestions (WINGS)5, a Chinese input method extended with intelligent writing assistance.",
        "Through WINGS, users can receive intelligent, real-time writing suggestions, including both word level and sentence level.",
        "Different from existing Chinese writing assistants, WINGS mainly attempts to spark users?",
        "writing inspirations from two aspects: providing diverse related words to expand users?",
        "minds and recommending contextual sentences according to their writing intentions.",
        "Based on corpus mining with Natural Language Processing techniques, e.g., word vector representation and LDA model, WINGS aims to facilitate Chinese writing in an effective and creative manner.",

        "Nowadays, Pinyin-based input method is the most popular one.",
        "The main strategy that Pinyin-based input method uses is automatically converting Pinyin to Chinese characters (Chen and Lee, 2000).",
        "In recent years, more and more intelligent strategies have been adopted by different input methods, such as Triivi 6 , an English input method that attempts to increase writing speed by suggesting words and phrases, and PRIME (Komatsu et al., 2005), an English/Japanese input system that utilizes visited documents to predict the user's next word to be input.",
        "In our system the basic process was Pinyin ?",
        "Characters (words) ?",
        "Writing Suggestions (including words and sentences).",
        "We mainly focused on writing suggestions from Characters (words) in this paper.",
        "As the Pinyin-to-Character was the underlining work, we developed our system directly on the open source framework of the IBus (an intelligent input Bus for Linux and Unix OS) and IBus-Pinyin7 input method.",
        "2.2 Writing Assistant As previously mentioned, several systems are available in supporting Chinese writing, such as WenXin Super Writing Assistant and Big Writer.",
        "6 http://baike.baidu.com/view/4849876.htm 7 https://code.google.com/p/ibus These systems are examples of a retrieval-based writing assistant, which is primarily based on a large examples library and provides users with a search function.",
        "In contrast, other writing assistants employ special NLP strategies.",
        "Liu et al. (2011, 2012) proposed two computer writing assistants: one for writing love letters and the other for blog writing.",
        "In these two systems, some special techniques were used, including text generation, synonym substitution, and concept expansion.",
        "PENS (Liu et al., 2000) and FLOW (Chen et al., 2012) are two writing assistants designed for students of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) practicing writing, which are mainly based on Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) strategies.",
        "Compared with the above mentioned systems, WINGS is closer to retrieval-based writing assistants in terms of function.",
        "However, WINGS can provide more intelligent suggestions because of the introduction of NLP techniques, e.g., word vector representation and topic model.",
        "2.3 Word Representations in Vector Space Recently, Mikolov et al. (2013) proposed novel model architectures to compute continuous vector representations of words obtained from very large data sets.",
        "The quality of these representations was assessed through a word similarity task, and according to their report, the word vectors provided state-of-the-art performance for measuring syntactic and semantic word similarities in their test set.",
        "Their research produced the open source tool word2vec8.",
        "In our system, we used word2vec to train the word vectors from a corpus we processed beforehand.",
        "For the Words Recommending Module, these vectors were used to determine the similarity among different words.",
        "8 https://code.google.com/p/word2vec 26 2.4 Latent Dirichlet Allocation The topic model Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a generative probabilistic model of a corpus.",
        "In this model, documents are represented as random mixtures of latent topics, where each topic is characterized by the distribution of words (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "Each document can thus be represented as a distribution of topics.",
        "Gibbs Sampling is a popular and efficient strategy used for LDA parameter estimation and inference.",
        "This technique is used in implementing several open sourcing LDA tools, such as GibbsLDA++9 (Phan and Nguyen, 2007), which was used in this paper.",

        "Finally, a total of 324,302 articles were merged into the large corpus (with a total size of 320 MB).",
        "For words recommending, each of the articles in our large corpus was segmented into words by ICTCLAS 12 with POS tags.",
        "Subsequently, word2vec tool was used on the words sequence (with useless symbols filtered).",
        "Finally, the words, their respective vector representations and 10 http://sourceforge.net/projects/clucene 11 http://www.diyifanwen.com 12 http://ictclas.nlpir.org main POS tags were combined, and we built these data into one binary file.",
        "For sentences recommending, the large corpus was segmented into sentences based on special punctuations.",
        "Sentences that were either too long or too short were discarded.",
        "Finally, 2,567,948 sentences were left, which we called original sentences.",
        "An index was created on these sentences using CLucene.",
        "Moreover, we segmented these original sentences and filtered the punctuations and stop words.",
        "Accordingly, these new sentences were named segmented sentences.",
        "We then ran GibbsLDA++ on the segmented sentences, and the Gibbs sampling result and topic vector of each sentence were thus obtained.",
        "Finally, we built the original sentence and their topic vectors into a binary file.",
