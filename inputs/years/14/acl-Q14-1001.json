        "Graph-based methods have been used to great effect in NLP, on problems such as word sense disambiguation (Mihalcea, 2005), summarization (Erkan and Radev, 2004), and dependency parsing (McDon- ald et al., 2005).",
        "Most previous studies of networks consider networks with only a single type of node, and in some cases using a network with a single type of node can be an oversimplified view if it ignores other types of relationships.",
        "In this paper we will demonstrate heterogeneous networks, networks with multiple different types of nodes and edges, along with several applications of them.",
        "The applications in this paper are not presented so much as robust attempts to out-perform the current state-of-the-art, but rather attempts at being competitive against top methods with little effort beyond the construction of the heterogeneous network.",
        "Throughout this paper, we will use the data from the ACL Anthology Network (AAN) (Bird et al., 2008; Radev et al., 2013), which contains additional metadata relationships not found in the ACL Anthol-ogy, as a typical heterogeneous network.",
        "The results in this paper should be generally applicable to other heterogeneous networks.",
        "1.1 Heterogeneous AAN schema We build a heterogeneous graph G(V,E) from AAN, where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges connecting vertices.",
        "A vertex can be one of five semantic types: {paper, author, venue, institution, term}.",

        "We show the usefulness of this representation in several applications: the measurement of scientific impact (Section 2), name disambiguation (Sec- tion 3), and topic modeling (Section 4).",
        "The heterogeneous network representation provides a simple framework for combining lexical networks (like the term co-occurence network) with metadata relations from a source like AAN and allows us to begin to develop NLP-aware methods for problems like scientometrics and name disambiguation, which are not usually framed in an NLP perspective.",

        "2 Scientific Impact Measurement The study of scientometrics, which attempts to quantify the scientific impact of papers, authors, etc.",
        "has received much attention recently, even within the NLP community.",
        "In the past few years, there have been many proposed measures of scientific impact based on relationships between entities.",
        "Intu-itively, a model that can take into account many different types of relationships between entities should be able to measure scientific impact more accurately than simpler measures like citation counts or h-index.",
        "We propose using Pagerank on the heterogeneous AAN (Page et al., 1999) to measure scientific impact.",
        "Since changes in the network schema can affect the relative rankings between different types of entities, this method is probably not appropriate for comparing entities of two different types against each other.",
        "But between nodes of the same type, this measure is an appropriate (and as we will show, accurate) way to compare impacts.",
        "We see this method as a first logical step in the direction of heterogeneous network-based sciento-metrics.",
        "This method could easily be extended to use a directed schema (Kurland and Lee, 2005) or a schema that is aware of the lexical content of citation sentences, such as sentiment-based signed networks (Hassan et al., 2012).",
        "Determining the intrinsic quality of scientific impact measures can be difficult since there is no way to collect gold standard measurements for real-world entities.",
        "Previous studies have attempted to show that their measures give high scores to a few known high-impact entities, e.g. Nobel prize winners (Hirsch, 2005), or have performed a statistical component analysis to find the most important measures in a group of related statistics (Bollen et al., 2009).",
        "Our approach, instead, is to generate realistic data from synthetic entities whose impacts are known.",
        "We had considered alternative formulations that did not rely on synthetic data, but each of them presented problems.",
        "When we attempted manual prominence annotation for AAN data, the inter-judge agreement (measured by Spearman correla-tion) in our experiments ranged from decent (0.9 in the case of institutions) to poor (0.3 for authors) to nearly random (0.03 for terms), far too low to use in most cases.",
        "We also considered evaluating prominence measures by their ability to predict future citations to an entity.",
        "Citations are often used as a proxy for impact, but our measurements have found that correlation between past citations and future citations is too high for citation prediction to be a meaningful evaluation3.",
        "2.1 Creating a synthetic AAN In network theory, a common technique for testing network algorithms when judgments of real-world data are expensive or impossible to obtain is to test the algorithm on a synthetic network.",
        "To create such a synthetic network, the authors define a simple, but realistic generative process by which the real-world networks of interest may arise.",
        "The properties of the network are measured to ensure that it replicates certain observable behaviors of the real-world network.",
        "They can then test network algorithms to see how well they are able to recover the hidden parameters that generated the synthetic network.",
        "(Pastor- Satorras and Vespignani, 2001; Clauset et al., 2009; Karrer and Newman, 2011) We take a two-step approach to generating this synthetic data, first generating entities with known impacts, and second, linking these entities together according to their latent impacts.",
        "Our heuristic is that high impact entities should be linked to other high impact entities and vice-versa.",
        "As in the network theory literature, we must show that this data reflects important properties observed in the true AAN.",
        "One such property is that the number of citations per paper follows a power law distribution (Redner, 1998).",
        "We observe this behavior in AAN along with several other small-world behaviors, such as a small diameter, a small average shortest path length, and a high clustering coefficient in the coauthorship graph.",
        "We strive to replicate these properties in our synthetic data.",
        "3Most existing impact measurements require access to at least one year's worth of citation information.",
        "The Spearman correlation between the number of citations received after one year and after five years is 0.79 with correlation between successive years as high as 0.99.",
        "Practically this means that the measures that best correlate with citations after five years are exactly those that best correlate with citations after one year.",
        "2 Since scientific impact measures attempt to quantify the true impact of entities, we can use these measures to help understand how the true impact measures are distributed across different entities.",
        "In fact, citation counts, being a good estimate of impact, can be used to generate these latent impact variables for each entity.",
        "For each type of entity (papers, authors, institutions, venues, and terms), we create a latent impact by sampling from the appropriate citation count distribution.",
        "After sampling, all the impacts are normalized to fall in the [0, 1] interval, with the highest-impact entity of each type having a latent impact of 1.",
        "Additive smoothing is used to avoid having an impact of 0.",
        "Once we have created the entities, our method for placing edges is most similar to the Erdo?s-Re?yni method for creating random graphs (Erdo's and Re?nyi, 1960), in which edges are distributed uniformly at random between pairs of vertices.",
        "Instead of distributing links uniformly, links between entities are sampled proportionally to I(a)I(b)(1 ?",
        "(I(a) ?",
        "I(b))2), where I(x) is the latent impact of entity x.",
        "We tried several other formulae that failed to replicate the properties of the real AAN.",
        "The I(a)I(b) part of the formula above reflects a preference for nodes of any type to connect with high-impact entities (e.g., major conferences receive many submissions even though most submissions will be rejected), but the 1 ?",
        "(I(a) ?",
        "I(b))2 part also reflects the reality that entities of similar prominence are most likely to attach to each other (e.g., well-known authors publish in major conferences, while less well-known authors may publish mostly in lesser-known workshops).",
        "Using this distribution, we randomly sample links between papers and authors; authors and institu-tions; papers and venues; and papers and terms.",
        "The only exception to this was paper-to-paper citation links, for which we did not expect this same behavior to apply, as low-impact papers regularly cite high-impact papers, but not vice-versa.",
        "To model ci-tations, we selected citing papers uniformly at random and cited papers in proportion to their impacts.",
        "(Albert and Baraba?si, 2002) Finally, we generated a network equal in size to AAN, that is, with the exact same numbers of pa-pers, authors, etc.",
        "and the exact same number of Relationship True value Synth.",
        "value Paper-citations power law coeff.",
        "1.82 2.12 Diameter 9 8 Avg.",
        "shortest path 4.27 4.05 Collaboration network clustering coeff.",
        "0.34 0.26 Table 1: Network properties of the synthetic AAN compared with the true AAN.",
        "paper-author links, paper-venue links, etc.",
        "Table 1 compares the observed properties of the true AAN with the observed properties of this synthetic version of AAN.",
        "None of the statistics are exact matches, but when building random graphs, it is not uncommon for measures to differ by many orders of magnitude, so a model that has measures that are on the same order of magnitude as the observed data is generally considered to be a decent model (Newman and Park, 2003).",
        "2.2 Measuring impact on the synthetic AAN This random network is, of course, still imperfect in some regards.",
        "First of all, it has no time aspect, so it is not possible for impact to change over time, which means we cannot test against some impact measures that have a time component like CiteR-ank (Maslov and Redner, 2008).",
        "Second, there are some constraints present in the real world that are not enforced here.",
        "Because the edges are randomly selected, some papers have no venues, while others have multiple venues.",
        "There is also nothing to enforce certain consistencies, such as authors publishing many papers from relatively few institutions, or repeatedly collaborating with the same authors.",
        "We had also considered using existing random graph models such as the Baraba?si-Albert model (Baraba?si and Albert, 1999), which are known to produce graphs that exhibit power law behavior.",
        "These models, however, do not provide a way to respect the latent impacts of the entities, as they add links in proportion only to the number of existing links a node has.",
        "We measure the quality of impact measures by comparing ranked lists: the ordering of the entities 3 Paper measure Agreement Heterogeneous network Pagerank 0.773 Citation network Pagerank 0.558 Citation count 0.642 Author measure Agreement Heterogeneous network Pagerank 0.461 Coauthorship network Pagerank 0.244 h-index (Hirsch, 2005) 0.292 Aggregated citation count 0.236 i10-index 0.235 Institution measure Agreement Heterogeneous network Pagerank 0.373 h-index (Mitra, 2006) 0.334 Aggregated citation count 0.327 Venue measure Agreement Heterogeneous network Pagerank 0.449 h-index (Braun et al., 2006) 0.425 Aggregated citation count 0.370 Impact factor 0.092 Venue citation network Pagerank (Bollen et al., 2006) 0.366 Table 2: Agreement of various impact measures with the true latent impact.",
        "by their true (but hidden) impact against their ordering according to the impact measure.",
        "The agreement between these lists is measured by Kendall's Tau.",
        "Table 2 compares several well-known impact measures with our impact measure, Pagerank centrality on the heterogeneous AAN network.",
        "We find that some popular methods, such as h-index (Hirsch, 2005) are too coarse to accurately capture much of the underlying variation.",
        "There is a version of Kendall's Tau that accounts for ties, and while this metric slightly helps the coarser measures, Pagerank on the heterogeneous network is still the clear winner.",
        "When comparing different ordering methods, it is natural to wonder which of entities the orderings disagree on.",
        "In general, non-heterogeneous measures like h-index or collaboration network Pager-ank, which only focus on one type of relationship can suffer when the entity in question has an important relationship of another type.",
        "For example, if an author is highly cited, but mostly works alone, his 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 20 40 60 80 100 120 Re lat ive Pa ge ran k ACL EMNLP COLING NAACL Figure 1: Evolution of conference impacts.",
        "The y-axis measures relative Pagerank, the entity's Pagerank relative to the average Pagerank in that year.",
        "contribution would be undervalued in the collaboration network, but would be more accurate in the heterogeneous network.",
        "The majority of the differences between the impact measures, though, tend to be in how they handle entities of low prominence.",
        "It seems that, for the most part, there is relatively little disagreement in the orderings of high-impact entities between different impact measures.",
        "That is, most highly prominent entities tend to be highly rated by most measures.",
        "But when an author or a paper, for example, only has one or two citations, it can be advantageous to look at more types of relationships than just citations.",
        "The paper may be written by an otherwise prominent author, or published at a well-known venue, and having many types of relations at its disposal can help a method like heterogeneous network Pagerank better distinguish between two low-prominence entities.",
        "2.3 Top-ranked entities according to heterogeneous network PageRank Table 3 shows the papers, authors, institutions, venues, and terms that received the highest Pagerank in the heterogeneous AAN.",
        "It is obvious that the top-ranked entities in this network are not simply the most highly cited entities.",
        "This ranking also does not have any time bias toward the entities that are currently prominent, as some of the top authors were more prolific in previous decades than at the current time.",
        "We also see this effect with COLING, which for many of the early years, is the only venue in the ACL Anthology.",

        "One possible way to address this is to use a narrower time window when creating the graph, such as only including edges from the previous five years.",
        "We apply this technique in the following section.",
        "2.4 Entity impact evolution The heterogeneous graph formalism also provides a natural way to study the evolution of impact over time, as in (Hall et al., 2008), but at a much finer granularity.",
        "Hall et al. measured the year-by-year prominence of statistical topics, but we can measure year-by-year prominence for any entity in the graph.",
        "To measure the evolution of impacts over the years, we iteratively create year-by-year versions of the heterogeneous AAN.",
        "Each of these graphs contains all entities along with all edges occurring in a five year window.",
        "Due to space, we cannot comprehensively exhibit this technique and the data it produces, but as a brief example, in Figure 1, we show how the impacts of some major NLP conferences changes over time.",
        "The graph shows that NAACL and EMNLP have been steadily gaining prominence since their intro-ductions, but also shows that ACL has had to make up a lot of ground since 1990 to surpass COLING.",
        "We also notice that all the major conferences have grown in impact since 2005, and believe that as the field continues to grow, the major conferences will continue to become more and more important.",
        "3 Name Disambiguation We frame network name disambiguation in a link prediction setting (Taskar et al., 2003; Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg, 2007).",
        "The problems of name disambiguation and link prediction share many char-acteristics, and we have found that if two ambiguous name nodes are close enough to be selected by a link-prediction method, then they likely correspond to the same real-world author.",
        "We intend to show that the heterogeneous bibliographic network can be used to better disambiguate author names than the author collaboration network.",
        "The heterogeneous network for this problem contains papers, authors, terms, venues, and institutions.",
        "We compare several well-known network similarity measures from link prediction by transforming the 5 Network Distance Measure Precision Recall F1-score Rand index Purity NMI Heterogeneous Truncated Commute Time 0.59 0.78 0.63 0.63 0.71 0.43 Heterogeneous Shortest Path 0.90 0.79 0.83 0.87 0.94 0.76 Heterogeneous PropFlow 0.89 0.83 0.84 0.87 0.93 0.77 Coauthorship Truncated Commute Time 0.47 0.80 0.54 0.47 0.60 0.18 Coauthorship Shortest Path 0.54 0.73 0.60 0.61 0.67 0.31 Coauthorship PropFlow 0.57 0.76 0.64 0.66 0.71 0.43 Coauthorship GHOST 0.89 0.60 0.69 0.81 0.94 0.63 Table 4: Performance of different networks and distance measures on the author name disambiguation task.",
        "The performance measures are averaged over the sets of two, three, and four authors.",
        "Rand index is from (Rand, 1971) and NMI is an abbreviation for normalized mutual information (Strehl and Ghosh, 2003) similarities to distances and inducing clusters of authors based on these distances.",
        "We compare three distance measures: shortest path, truncated commute time (Sarkar et al., 2008), and PropFlow (Lichtenwalter et al., 2010).",
        "Shortest path distance can be a useful metric for author disambiguation because it is small when two ambiguous nodes are neighbors in the graph or share a neighbor.",
        "Its downside is that it only considers one path between nodes, the shortest, and cannot take advantage of the fact that there may be many short paths between two nodes.",
        "Truncated commute time is a variant of commute time where all paths longer than some threshold are truncated.",
        "The truncation threshold l should be set such that no semantically meaningful path is truncated.",
        "We use a value of ten for l in the heterogeneous graph and three in the coauthorship graph4.",
        "The advantage of truncated commute time over ordinary commute time is simpler calculation, as no paths longer than l need be considered.",
        "The downside of this method is that large branching factors tend to lead to less agreement between commute time and truncated commute time.",
        "PropFlow is a quantity that measures the probability that a non-intersecting random walk starting at node a reaches node b in l steps or fewer, where l is again a threshold.",
        "As before, l should be a bound on the length of semantically meaningful paths, so we use the same values for l as with truncated commute time.",
        "Of course, PropFlow is not a metric, which is 4This is a standard coauthorship graph with the edge weights equal to the number of publications shared between authors.",
        "The heterogeneous network does not have author-to-author links, as authors are linked by paper nodes.",
        "required for some clustering methods.",

        "With each of the distance measures, we apply the same clustering method: partitioning around medoids, with the number of clusters automatically determined using the gap statistic method (Tibshi- rani et al., 2001).",
        "We create the null distribution needed for the gap statistic method by many iterations of randomly sampling distances from the complete distance matrix between all nodes in the graph.",
        "The gap statistic method automatically selects the number of clusters from two, three, or four author clusters.",
        "We compare our methods against GHOST (Fan et al., 2011), a high-performance author disambiguation method based on the coauthorship graph.",
        "3.1 Data To generate name disambiguation data, we use the pseudoword method of (Gale et al., 1992).",
        "Specif-ically, we choose two or more completely random authors and conflate them by giving all instances of both authors the same name.",
        "We let each paper written by this pseudoauthor be an instance to be clustered.",
        "The clusters produced by any author disambiguation method can then be compared against the papers actually written by each of the two authors.",
        "This method, of course, relies on having all of the underlying authors completely disambiguated, which AAN provides.",
        "This method is used to create 100 distambiguation sets with two authors, 100 for three authors, and 100 for four authors.",
        "6 3.2 Results Table 4 shows the performance of author name disambiguation with different networks and distance metrics.",
        "F1-score is the measure that is most often used to compare author disambiguation methods.",
        "Both PropFlow and shortest path similarity on the heterogeneous network perform quite well according this measure, as well as the other reported measures.",
        "While comparable recall can be achieved using only the coauthorship graph, the heterogeneous graph allows for much higher precision.",
        "4 Random walk topic model Here we present a topic model based entirely on graph random walks.",
        "This method is not truly a statistical model as there are no statistical parameters being learned, but rather a topic-discovery and -assignment method, attempting to solve the same problem as statistical topic models such as probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) (Hofmann, 1999) or latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "In the absence of better terminology, we use the name random walk topic model.",
        "While this method does not have the robust mathematical foundation that statistical topic models pos-sess, in its favor it has modularity, simplicity, and interpretability.",
        "This language model is modular as it completely separates the discovery of topics from the association of topics with entities.",
        "It is simple because it requires only a clustering algorithm and random walk algorithms, instead of complex inference algorithms.",
        "The method also does not require any modification if the topology of the network changes, whereas statistical models may need an entirely different inference procedure if, e.g., author topics are desired in addition to paper topics.",
        "Thirdly this method is easily interpretable with topics provided by clustering in the word-relatedness graph and topic association based on random walks from entities to topics.",
        "4.1 Topics from word graph clustering From the set of ACL anthology titles, we create two graphs: (1) a word relatedness graph by creating a weighted link between each pair of words corresponding to the PropFlow (Lichtenwalter et al., 2010) measure between them on the full heterogeneous graph and (2) a word co-occurence graph by creating a weighted link between each pair of words corresponding to the number of titles in which both words occur.",
        "Both of these graphs are then clustered using Graph Factorization Clustering (GFC).",

        "While there are many other tasks, such as citation-based summarization, that could likely be approached using this framework with the appropriate addition of new types of nodes into the heterogeneous AAN network, there are even some potential synergies between the tasks described in this paper that have yet to be explored.",
        "For example, we may consider that the methods of the author disambiguation or topic modeling tasks could be to find the highest-impact papers associated with a term (for survey generation, perhaps) or high-impact authors associated with a workshop's topic (to select good reviewers for it).",
