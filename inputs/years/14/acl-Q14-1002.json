        "In this paper we describe FLORS, a part-of-speech (POS) tagger that is Fast in training and tagging, uses LOcal context only (as opposed to finding the optimal tag sequence for the entire sentence), performs Robustly on target domains (TDs) in unsupervised domain adaptation (DA) and is Simple in architecture and feature representation.",
        "FLORS constructs a robust representation of the local context of the word v that is to be tagged.",
        "This representation consists of distributional fea-tures, suffixes and word shapes of v and its local neighbors.",
        "We show that it has two advantages.",
        "First, since the main predictors used by FLORS are distributional features (not the word's identity), FLORS predicts unseen tags of known words better than prior work on DA for POS.",
        "Second, since FLORS uses representations computed from unlabeled text, representations of unknown words are in principle of the same type as representations of known words; this property of FLORS results in better performance on unknown words compared to prior work.",
        "These two advantages are especially beneficial for TDs that contain high rates of unseen tags of known words and high rates of unknown words.",
        "We show that FLORS achieves excellent DA tagging results on the five domains of the SANCL 2012 shared task (Petrov and McDonald, 2012) and outperforms three state-of-the-art taggers on Blitzer et al.'s (2006) biomedical data.",
        "FLORS is also simpler and faster than other POS DA methods.",
        "It is simple in that the input representation consists of three simple types of features: distributional count features and two types of binary features, suffix and shape features.",
        "Many other word representations that are used for improving generalization (e.g., (Brown et al., 1992; Collobert et al., 2011)) are costly to train or have difficulty handling unknown words.",
        "Our representations are fast to build and can be created on-the-fly for unknown words that occur during testing.",
        "The learning architecture is simple and fast as well.",
        "We train k binary one-vs-all classifiers that use local context only and no sequence information (where k is the number of tags).",
        "Thus, tagging complexity is O(k).",
        "Many other learning se-tups for DA are more complex; e.g., they learn representations (as opposed to just counting), they learn several classifiers for different subclasses of words (e.g., known vs. unknown) or they combine left-to-right and right-to-left taggings.",
        "The next two sections describe experimental data, setup and results.",
        "Results are discussed in Section 4.",
        "We compare FLORS to alternative word representations in Section 5 and to related work in Section 6.",
        "Section 7 presents our conclusions.",

        "The first five TDs (newsgroups, weblogs, reviews, answers, emails) are from the SANCL shared task (Petrov and McDonald, 2012).",
        "Additionally, the SANCL dataset contains sections 22 and 23 of the WSJ for in-domain development and testing, respectively.",
        "Each SANCL TD has an unlabeled training set of 100,000 sentences and development and test sets of about 1000 labeled sentences each.",
        "The sixth TD is BIO, the Penn BioTreebank data set distributed by Blitzer.",
        "It consists of dev and test sets of 500 sentences each and 100,000 unlabeled sentences.",
        "Classification setup.",
        "Similar to SVMTool (Gim?nez and M?rquez, 2004) and Choi and Palmer (2012) (henceforth: C&P), we use local context only for tagging instead of performing sequence classification.",
        "For a word w occurring as token vi in a sen-tence, we build a feature vector for a local window of size 2l + 1 around vi.",
        "The representation of the object to be classified is this feature vector and the target class is the POS tag of vi.",
        "We use the linear L2-regularized L2-loss SVM implementation provided by LIBLINEAR (Fan et al., 2008) to train k one-vs-all classifiers on the training set where k is the number of POS tags in the training set (in our case k = 45).",
        "We train with un-tuned default parameters; in particular, C = 1.",
        "In the special case of linear SVMs, the value of C does not need to be tuned exhaustively as the solution remains constant after C has reached a certain threshold value C?",

        "Normalization also has a beneficial effect on SVM training time because it alleviates numerical problems (Fan et al., 2008).",
        "Distributional features.",
        "We follow a long tradition of older (Finch and Chater, 1992; Schütze, 1993; Schütze, 1995) and newer (Huang and Yates, 2009) work on creating distributional features for POS tagging based on local left and right neighbors.",
        "Specifically, the ith entry xi of f left(w) is the weighted number of times that the indicator word ci occurs immediately to the left of w: xi = tf (freq (bigram(ci, w))) where ci is the word with frequency rank i in the cor-pus, freq (bigram(ci, w)) is the number of times the bigram ?ci w?",

        "tf-weighting has been used by other researchers (Huang and Yates, 2009) and showed good performance in our own previous work.",

        "so the unknown tag rates in Table 4 are probably lower bounds for the error that is due to unknown tags.",
        "Based on these considerations, it is not surprising that tagging accuracy (e.g., of FLORS basic) and unknown tag rate are correlated as we can see in Tables 2, 4 and 6; e.g., we get the highest accuracies in the two domains that do not have unknown tags (weblogs and WSJ) and the lowest accuracy in the domain with the highest rate (BIO).",
        "Since unknown tags cannot be predicted correctly, one could simply report accuracy on known tags.",
        "However, given the negative effect of unknown tags on tagging accuracy of the local context in which they occur, excluding unknown tags does not fully address the problem.",
        "For this reason, it is probably best to keep the common practice of simply reporting accuracy on all tokens, including unknown tags.",
        "But the percentages of unknown tags should also be reported for each dataset as a basis for a more accurate interpretation of results.",
        "Another type of error that cannot be avoided in unsupervised DA is due to differences in annotation guidelines.",

        "Typically, prefixes of Brown clusters (Brown et al., 1992) are added to increase the robustness of POS taggers (e.g., Toutanova et al. (2003)).",
        "Computational costs are high (quadratic in the vocabulary size) although the computation can be parallelized (Uszkoreit and Brants, 2008).",
        "More recently, general word representations (Col- lobert et al., 2011; Turian et al., 2010) have been used for robust POS tagging.",
        "These word representations are typically trained on a large amount of unlabeled text and fine-tuned for specific NLP tasks.",
        "Similar to Brown clusters, they are low-dimensional and can be used as features in many NLP tasks, ei-22 ther alone or in combination with other features.",
        "To compare fdist(w) (our distributional repre-sentations) with Brown clusters, we induced 1000 Brown clusters on the joint corpus data DALL (see Section 2) using the publicly available implementation of Liang (2005).",
        "We padded sentences with ?BOUNDARY?",
        "tokens on each side and used path prefixes of length 4, 6, 10 and 20 as features for each word (cf. Ratinov and Roth (2009), Turian et al. (2010)).",
        "C&W embeddings are provided by Collobert et al. (2011): 50-dimensional vectors for 130,000 words from WSJ, trained on Wikipedia.",
        "Similar to our distributional representations fdist(w), the embeddings also contain a ?BOUNDARY?",
        "token (which they call PADDING).",

        "before we look up a representation during training and testing.",
        "We replaced the distributional features in our basic setup by either Brown cluster features or C&W embeddings.",
        "Table 7 repeats lines 5 and 7 of Table 2 and gives results of the modified FLORS setup.",

        "Also, WSJ was used to tune parameters during development.",
        "As with our previous experiments, OOV results on emails seem slightly more sensitive to parameter choices than on other domains (recall the discussion of this issue in Section 4).",

        "Furthermore, the evidence we have presented suggests that fdist are comparable in performance to C&W embeddings if not better for POS DA.",
