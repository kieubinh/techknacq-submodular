        "Supervised statistical learning methods have enjoyed great popularity in Natural Language Processing (NLP) over the past decade.",
        "The success of supervised methods depends heavily upon the availability of large amounts of annotated training data.",
        "Manual curation of annotated corpora is a costly and time consuming process.",
        "To date, most annotated resources resides within the English language, which hinders the adoption of supervised learning methods in many multilingual environments.",
        "To minimize the need for annotation, significant progress has been made in developing unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches to NLP (Collins and Singer 1999; Klein 2005; Liang 2005; Smith 2006; Goldberg 2010; inter alia) .",
        "More recent paradigms for semi-supervised learning allow mod-elers to directly encode knowledge about the task and the domain as constraints to guide learning (Chang et al., 2007; Mann and McCallum, 2010; Ganchev et al., 2010).",
        "However, in a multilingual setting, coming up with effective constraints require extensive knowledge of the foreign1 language.",
        "Bilingual parallel text (bitext) lends itself as a medium to transfer knowledge from a resource-rich language to a foreign languages.",
        "Yarowsky and Ngai (2001) project labels produced by an English tagger to the foreign side of bitext, then use the projected labels to learn a HMM model.",
        "More recent work applied the projection-based approach to more language-pairs, and further improved performance through the use of type-level constraints from tag dictionary and feature-rich generative or discriminative models (Das and Petrov, 2011; Ta?ckstro?m et al., 2013).",
        "In our work, we propose a new projection-based method that differs in two important ways.",
        "First, we never explicitly project the labels.",
        "Instead, we project expectations over the labels.",
        "This projection 1For experimental purposes, we designate English as the resource-rich language, and other languages of interest as ?for- eign?.",
        "In our experiments, we simulate the resource-poor scenario using Chinese and German, even though in reality these two languages are quite rich in resources.",

        "acts as a soft constraint over the labels, which allows us to transfer more information and uncertainty across language boundaries.",
        "Secondly, we encode the expectations as constraints and train a model by minimizing divergence between model expectations and projected expectations in a Generalized Expectation (GE) Criteria (Mann and McCallum, 2010) framework.",
        "We evaluate our approach on Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks for English-Chinese and English-German language pairs on standard public datasets.",
        "We report results in two settings: a weakly supervised setting where no labeled data or a small amount of labeled data is available, and a semi-supervised settings where labeled data is available, but we can gain predictive power by learning from unlabeled bitext.",
        "2 Related Work Most semi-supervised learning approaches embody the principle of learning from constraints.",
        "There are two broad categories of constraints: multi-view con-straints, and external knowledge constraints.",
        "Examples of methods that explore multi-view constraints include self-training (Yarowsky, 1995; McClosky et al., 2006),2 co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Sindhwani et al., 2005), multi-view learning (Ando and Zhang, 2005; Carlson et al., 2010), and discriminative and generative model combination (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008; Druck and McCallum, 2010).",
        "An early example of using knowledge as constraints in weakly-supervised learning is the work by Collins and Singer (1999).",
        "They showed that the addition of a small set of ?seed?",
        "rules greatly improve a co-training style unsupervised tagger.",
        "Chang et al. (2007) proposed a constraint-driven learning (CODL) framework where constraints are used to guide the selection of best self-labeled examples to be included as additional training data in an iterative EM-style procedure.",
        "The kind of constraints used in applications such as NER are the ones like ?the words CA, Australia, NY are LOCATION?",
        "(Chang et al., 2007).",
        "Notice the similarity of this partic-2A multi-view interpretation of self-training is that the self-tagged additional data offers new views to learners trained on existing labeled data.",
        "ular constraint to the kinds of features one would expect to see in a discriminative MaxEnt model.",
        "The difference is that instead of learning the validity (or weight) of this feature from labeled examples ?",
        "since we do not have them ?",
        "we can constrain the model using our knowledge of the domain.",
        "Druck et al. (2009) also demonstrated that in an active learning setting where annotation budget is lim-ited, it is more efficient to label features than examples.",
        "Other sources of knowledge include lexicons and gazetteers (Druck et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2007).",
        "While it is straight-forward to see how resources such as a list of city names can give a lot of mileage in recognizing locations, we are also exposed to the danger of over-committing to hard constraints.",
        "For example, it becomes problematic with city names that are ambiguous, such as Augusta, Georgia.3 To soften these constraints, Mann and McCallum (2010) proposed the Generalized Expectation (GE) Criteria framework, which encodes constraints as a regularization term over some score function that measures the divergence between the model's expectation and the target expectation.",
        "The connection between GE and CODL is analogous to the relationship between hard (Viterbi) EM and soft EM, as illustrated by Samdani et al. (2012).",
        "Another closely related work is the Posterior Regularization (PR) framework by Ganchev et al. (2010).",
        "In fact, as Bellare et al. (2009) have shown, in a discriminative model these two methods optimize exactly the same objective.",
        "The two differ in optimization details: PR uses a EM algorithm to approximate the gradients which avoids the expensive computation of a covariance matrix between features and constraints, whereas GE directly calculates the gradient.",
        "However, later results (Druck, 2011) have shown that using the Expectation Semiring techniques of Li and Eisner (2009), one can compute the exact gradients of GE in a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) at costs 3This is a city in the state of Georgia in USA, famous for its golf courses.",
        "It is ambiguous since both Augusta and Georgia can also be used as person names.",
        "4The different terminology employed by GE and PR may be confusing to discerning readers, but the ?expectation?",
        "in the context of GE means the same thing as ?marginal posterior?",
        "as in PR.",
        "56 no greater than computing the gradients of ordinary CRF.",
        "And empirically, GE tends to perform more accurately than PR (Bellare et al., 2009; Druck, 2011).",
        "Obtaining appropriate knowledge resources for constructing constraints remain as a bottleneck in applying GE and PR to new languages.",
        "However, a number of past work recognizes parallel bitext as a rich source of linguistic constraints, naturally captured in the translations.",
        "As a result, bitext has been effectively utilized for unsupervised multilingual grammar induction (Alshawi et al., 2000; Snyder et al., 2009), parsing (Burkett and Klein, 2008), and sequence labeling (Naseem et al., 2009).",
        "A number of recent work also explored bilingual constraints in the context of simultaneous bilingual tagging, and showed that enforcing agreements between language pairs give superior results than monolingual tagging (Burkett et al., 2010; Che et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013a).",
        "Burkett et al. (2010) also demonstrated a uptraining (Petrov et al., 2010) setting where tag-induced bitext can be used as additional monolingual training data to improve monolingual taggers.",
        "A major drawback of this approach is that it requires a readily-trained tagging models in each languages, which makes a weakly supervised setting infeasible.",
        "Another intricacy of this approach is that it only works when the two models have comparable strength, since mutual agreements are enforced between them.",
        "Projection-based methods can be very effective in weakly-supervised scenarios, as demonstrated by Yarowsky and Ngai (2001), and Xi and Hwa (2005).",
        "One problem with projected labels is that they are often too noisy to be directly used as training signals.",
        "To mitigate this problem, Das and Petrov (2011) designed a label propagation method to automatically induce a tag lexicon for the foreign language to smooth the projected labels.",
        "Fossum and Abney (2005) filter out projection noise by combining projections from from multiple source languages.",
        "However, this approach is not always viable since it relies on having parallel bitext from multiple source languages.",
        "Li et al. (2012) proposed the use of crowd-sourced Wiktionary as additional resources for inducing tag lexicons.",
        "More recently, Ta?ckstro?m et al. (2013) combined token-level and type-level constraints to constrain legitimate label sequences and and recalibrate the probability distribution in a CRF.",
        "The tag dictionary used for POS tagging are analogous to the gazetteers and name lexicons used for NER by Chang et al. (2007).",
        "Our work is also closely related to Ganchev et al. (2009).",
        "They used a two-step projection method similar to Das and Petrov (2011) for dependency parsing.",
        "Instead of using the projected linguistic structures as ground truth (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001), or as features in a generative model (Das and Petrov, 2011), they used them as constraints in a PR framework.",
        "Our work differs by projecting expectations rather than Viterbi one-best labels.",
        "We also choose the GE framework over PR.",
        "Experiments in Bellare et al. (2009) and Druck (2011) suggest that in a discriminative model (like ours), GE is more accurate than PR.",
        "More recently, Ganchev and Das (2013) further extended this line of work to directly train discriminative sequence models using cross lingual projection with PR.",
        "The types of constraints applied in this new work are similar to the ones in the monolingual PR setting proposed by Ganchev et al. (2010), where the total counts of labels of a particular kind are expected to match some fraction of the projected total counts.",
        "Our work differ in that we enforce expectation constraints at token level, which gives tighter guidance to learning the model.",
        "3 Approach Given bitext between English and a foreign lan-guage, our goal is to learn a CRF model in the foreign language from little or no labeled data.",
        "Our method performs Cross-Lingual Projected Expectation Regularization (CLiPER).",
        "For every aligned sentence pair in the bitext, we first compute the posterior marginal at each word position on the English side using a pre-trained English CRF tagger; then for each aligned English word, we project its posterior marginal as expectations to the aligned word position on the foreign side.",
        "Figure 1 shows a snippet of a sentence from real corpus.",
        "Notice that if we were to directly project the Viterbi best assignment from English to Chinese, all three Chinese words that are named entities would have gotten the wrong tags.",
