        "We propose to use the visual denotations of linguistic expressions (i.e. the set of images they describe) to define novel denotational similarity metrics, which we show to be at least as beneficial as distributional similarities for two tasks that require semantic inference.",
        "To compute these denotational similarities, we construct a denotation graph, i.e. a subsumption hierarchy over constituents and their de-notations, based on a large corpus of 30K images and 150K descriptive captions."

        "The ability to draw inferences from text is a prerequisite for language understanding.",
        "These inferences are what makes it possible for even brief descriptions of everyday scenes to evoke rich mental images.",
        "For example, we would expect an image of people shopping in a supermarket to depict aisles of produce or other goods, and we would expect most of these people to be customers who are either standing or walking around.",
        "But such inferences require a great deal of commonsense world knowledge.",
        "Standard distributional approaches to lexical similarity (Section 2.1) are very effective at identifying which words are related to the same topic, and can provide useful features for systems that perform semantic inferences (Mirkin et al., 2009), but are not suited to capture precise entailments between complex expressions.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the automatic acquisition of denotational similarities between descriptions of everyday situations (Section 2).",
        "We define the (visual) denotation of a linguistic expression as the set of images it describes.",
        "We create a corpus of images of everyday activities (each paired with multiple cap-tions; Section 3) to construct a large scale visual denotation graph which associates image descriptions with their denotations (Section 4).",
        "The algorithm that constructs the denotation graph uses purely syntactic and lexical rules to produce simpler captions (which have a larger denotation).",
        "But since each image is originally associated with several captions, the graph can also capture similarities between syntactically and lexically unrelated descriptions.",
        "We apply these similarities to two different tasks (Sec- tions 6 and 7): an approximate entailment recognition task for our domain, where the goal is to decide whether the hypothesis (a brief image caption) refers to the same image as the premises (four longer cap-tions), and the recently introduced Semantic Textual Similarity task (Agirre et al., 2012), which can be viewed as a graded (rather than binary) version of paraphrase detection.",
        "Both tasks require semantic inference, and our results indicate that denotational similarities are at least as effective as standard approaches to similarity.",
        "Our code and data set, as well as the denotation graph itself and the lexical similarities we define over it are available for research purposes at http://nlp.cs.illinois.edu/ Denotation.html.",

        "This has led to the definition of vector-based distributional similarities, which represent each word w as a vector w derived from counts of w's co-occurrence with other words.",
        "These vectors can be used directly to compute the lexical similarities of words, either via the cosine of the angle between them, or via other, more complex metrics (Lin, 1998).",
        "More recently, asymmetric similarities have been proposed as more suitable for semantic inference tasks such as entailment (Weeds and Weir, 2003; Szpektor and Dagan, 2008; Clarke, 2009; Kotlerman et al., 2010).",
        "Distributional word vectors can also be used to define the compositional similarity of longer strings (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010).",
        "To compute the similarity of two strings, the lexical vectors of the words in each string are first combined into a single vector (e.g. by element-wise addition or multiplication), and then an appropriate vector similarity (e.g. cosine) is applied to the resulting pair of vectors.",
        "2.2 Visual Denotations Our approach is inspired by truth-conditional semantic theories in which the denotation of a declarative sentence is assumed to be the set of all situations or possible worlds in which the sentence is true (Montague, 1974; Dowty et al., 1981; Barwise and Perry, 1980).",
        "Restricting our attention to visually descriptive sentences, i.e. non-negative, episodic (Carlson, 2005) sentences that can be used to describe an image (Figure 1), we propose to instantiate the abstract notions of possible worlds or situations with concrete sets of images.",

        "2.3 Denotation Graphs Denotations induce a partial ordering over descrip-tions: if s (e.g. ?a poodle runs on the beach?)",
        "entails a description s?",
        "(e.g. ?a dog runs?",
        "), its denotation is a subset of the denotation of s?",
        "(JsK ?",
        "Js?K), and we say that s?",

        "dog).",
        "These operations are akin to the atomic edits of MacCartney and Manning (2008)'s NatLog system, and allow us to construct large subsumption hierarchies over image descriptions, which we call denotation graphs.",

        "It contains and extends Hodosh et al. (2013)'s corpus of 8,092 images.",
        "We followed Hodosh et al. (2013)'s approach to collect images.",
        "We also use their annotation guidelines, and use similar quality controls to correct spelling mistakes, eliminate ungrammatical or non-descriptive sentences.",
        "Almost all of the images that we add to those collected by Hodosh et al. (2013) have been made available under a Creative Commons license.",
        "Each image is described independently by five annotators who are not familiar with the specific entities and circumstances depicted in them, resulting in captions such as ?Three people setting up a tent?, rather than the kind of captions people provide for their own images (?Our trip to the Olympic Peninsula?).",
        "Moreover, different annotators use different levels of specificity, from describing the overall situation (performing a musical piece) to specific actions (bowing on a violin).",
        "This variety of descriptions associated with the same image is what allows us to induce denotational similarities between expressions that are not trivially related by syntactic rewrite rules.",
        "4 Constructing the Denotation Graph The construction of the denotation graph consists of the following steps: preprocessing and linguistic analysis of the captions, identification of applicable transformations, and generation of the graph itself.",
        "Preprocessing and Linguistic Analysis We use the Linux spell checker, the OpenNLP tok-enizer, POS tagger and chunker (http://opennlp.",
        "apache.org), and the Malt parser (Nivre et al., 2006) to analyze the captions.",
        "Since the vocabulary of our corpus differs significantly from the data these tools are trained on, we resort to a number of heuristics to improve the analyses they provide.",
        "Since some heuristics require us to identify different entity types, we developed a lexicon of the most common entity types in our domain (people, clothing, bodily appearance (e.g. hair or body parts), containers of liquids, food items and vehicles).",
        "After spell-checking, we normalize certain words and compounds with several spelling variations, e.g. barbecue (barbeque, BBQ), gray (grey), waterski (water ski), brown-haired (brown haired), and tokenize the captions using the OpenNLP tokenizer.",
        "The OpenNLP POS tagger makes a number of systematic errors on our corpus (e.g. mistagging main verbs as nouns).",
        "Since these errors are highly sys-tematic, we are able to correct them automatically by applying deterministic rules (e.g. climbs is never a noun in our corpus, stand is a noun if it is preceded by vegetable but a verb when preceded by a noun that refers to people).",
        "These fixes apply to 27,784 (17% of the 158,915 image captions).",
        "Next, we use the OpenNLP chunker to create a shallow parse.",
        "Fixing its (systematic) errors affects 28,587 captions.",
        "We then analyze the structure of each NP chunk to identify heads, determiners and pre-nominal modifiers.",
        "The head may include more than a single token if WordNet (or our hypernym lexi-con, described below) contains a corresponding entry (e.g. little girl).",
        "Determiners include phrases such as a couple or a few.",
        "Although we use the Malt parser (Nivre et al., 2006) to identify subject-verb-object dependencies, we have found it more accurate to develop deterministic heuristics and lexi-69 cal rules to identify the boundaries of complex (e.g. conjoined) NPs, allowing us to treat ?a man with red shoes and a white hat?",
        "as an NP followed by a single PP, but ?a man with red shoes and a white-haired woman?",
        "as two NPs, and to transform e.g. ?stand- ing by a man and a woman?",
        "into ?standing?",
        "and not ?standing and a woman?",
        "when dropping the PP. Hypernym Lexicon We use our corpus and WordNet to construct a hypernym lexicon that allows us to replace head nouns with more generic terms.",
        "We only consider hypernyms that occur themselves with sufficient frequency in the original captions (replac- ing ?adult?",
        "with ?person?, but not with ?organ- ism?).",
        "Since the language in our corpus is very concrete, each noun tends to have a single sense, allowing us to always replace it with the same hyper-nyms.1 But since WordNet provides us with multiple senses for most nouns, we first have to identify which sense is used in our corpus.",
        "To do this, we use the heuristic cross-caption coreference algorithm of Hodosh et al. (2010) to identify coreferent NP chunks among the original five captions of each image.2 For each ambiguous head noun, we consider every non-singleton coreference chains it appears in, and reduce its synsets to those that stand in a hypernym-hyponym relation with at least one other head noun in the chain.",
        "Finally, we apply a greedy majority voting algorithm to iteratively narrow down each term's senses to a single synset that is compatible with the largest number of coreference chains it occurs in.",
        "Caption Normalization In order to increase the recall of the denotations we capture, we drop all punctuation marks, and lemmatize nouns, verbs, and adjectives that end in ?-ed?",
        "or ?-ing?",
        "before gener-1Descriptions of people that refer to both age and gender (e.g.",
        "?man?)",
        "can have multiple distinct hypernyms (?adult?/??male?).",
        "Because our annotators never describe young children or babies as ?persons?, we only allow terms that are likely to describe adults or teenagers (including occu-pations) to be replaced by the term ?person?.",
        "This means that the term ?girl?",
        "has two senses: a female child (the default) or a younger woman.",
        "We distinguish the two senses in a preprocessing step: if the other captions of the same image do not mention children, but refer to teenaged or adult women, we assign girl the woman-sense.",
        "Some nouns that end in -er (e.g.",
        "?diner?, ?pitcher?",
        "also violate our monosemy assumption.",

        "In order to distinguish between frequently occurring homonyms where the noun is unrelated to the verb, we change all forms of the verb dress to dressed, all forms of the verb stand to standing and all forms of the verb park to parking.",
        "Finally, we drop sentence-initial there/here/this is/are (as in there is a dog splashing in the water), and normalize the expressions in X and dressed (up) in X (where X is an article of clothing or a color) to wear X.",
