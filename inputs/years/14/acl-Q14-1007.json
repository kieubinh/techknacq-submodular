        "Abstract",
        "We present a large scale study of the languages spoken by bilingual workers on Mechanical Turk (MTurk).",
        "We establish a methodology for determining the language skills of anonymous crowd workers that is more robust than simple surveying.",
        "We validate workers?",
        "self-reported language skill claims by measuring their ability to correctly translate words, and by geolocating workers to see if they reside in countries where the languages are likely to be spoken.",
        "Rather than posting a one-off survey, we posted paid tasks consisting of 1,000 assignments to translate a total of 10,000 words in each of 100 languages.",
        "Our study ran for several months, and was highly visible on the MTurk crowdsourcing platform, increasing the chances that bilingual workers would complete it.",
        "Our study was useful both to create bilingual dictionaries and to act as census of the bilingual speakers on MTurk.",
        "We use this data to recommend languages with the largest speaker populations as good candidates for other researchers who want to develop crowdsourced, multilingual technologies.",
        "To further demonstrate the value of creating data via crowdsourcing, we hire workers to create bilingual parallel corpora in six Indian lan-guages, and use them to train statistical machine translation systems.",
        "1 Overview Crowdsourcing is a promising new mechanism for collecting data for natural language processing research.",
        "Access to a fast, cheap, and flexible workforce allows us to collect new types of data, potentially enabling new language technologies.",
        "Because crowdsourcing platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) give researchers access to a worldwide workforce, one obvious application of crowdsourcing is the creation of multilingual technologies.",
        "With an increasing number of active crowd workers located outside of the United States, there is even the potential to reach fluent speakers of lower resource languages.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of hiring language informants on MTurk by conducting the first large-scale demographic study of the languages spoken by workers on the platform.",
        "There are several complicating factors when trying to take a census of workers on MTurk.",
        "The workers?",
        "identities are anonymized, and Amazon provides no information about their countries of origin or their language abilities.",
        "Posting a simple survey to have workers report this information may be inadequate, since (a) many workers may never see the survey, (b) many opt not to do one-off surveys since potential payment is low, and (c) validating the answers of respondents is not straightforward.",
        "Our study establishes a methodology for determining the language demographics of anonymous crowd workers that is more robust than simple surveying.",
        "We ask workers what languages they speak and what country they live in, and validate their claims by measuring their ability to correctly translate words and by recording their geolocation.",
        "To increase the visibility and the desirability of our tasks, we post 1,000 assignments in each of 100 languages.",
        "These tasks each consist of translating 10 foreign words into English.",
        "Two of the 10 words have known translations, allowing us to validate that the workers?",
        "translations are accurate.",
        "We construct bilingual dictionaries with up to 10,000 entries, with the majority of entries being new.",
        "Surveying thousands of workers allows us to ana-lyze current speaker populations for 100 languages.",

        "MTurk allows employers to provide micro-payments in return for workers completing micro-tasks.",
        "The basic units of work on MTurk are called ?Human Intelligence Tasks?",
        "(HITs).",
        "MTurk was designed to accommodate tasks that are difficult for computers, but simple for people.",
        "This facilitates research into human computation, where people can be treated as a function call (von Ahn, 2005; Little et al., 2009; Quinn and Bederson, 2011).",
        "It has application to research areas like human-computer interaction (Bigham et al., 2010; Bernstein et al., 2010), computer vision (Sorokin and Forsyth, 2008; Deng et al., 2010; Rashtchian et al., 2010), speech processing (Marge et al., 2010; Lane et al., 2010; Parent and Eskenazi, 2011; Eskenazi et al., 2013), and natural language processing (Snow et al., 2008; Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010; Laws et al., 2011).",
        "On MTurk, researchers who need work completed are called ?Requesters?, and workers are often referred to as ?Turkers?.",
        "MTurk is a true market, meaning that Turkers are free to choose to complete the HITs which interest them, and Requesters can price their tasks competitively to try to attract workers and have their tasks done quickly (Faridani et al., 2011; Singer and Mittal, 2011).",
        "Turkers remain anonymous to Requesters, and all payment occurs through Amazon.",
        "Requesters are able to accept submitted work or reject work that does not meet their standards.",
        "Turkers are only paid if a Requester accepts their work.",
        "Several reports examine Mechanical Turk as an economic market (Ipeirotis, 2010a; Lehdonvirta and Ernkvist, 2011).",
        "When Amazon introduced MTurk, it first offered payment only in Amazon credits, and later offered direct payment in US dollars.",
        "More re-cently, it has expanded to include one foreign cur-rency, the Indian rupee.",
        "Despite its payments being limited to two currencies or Amazon credits, MTurk claims over half a million workers from 190 countries (Amazon, 2013).",
        "This suggests that its worker population should represent a diverse set of languages.",
        "80 A demographic study by Ipeirotis (2010b) focused on age, gender, martial status, income lev-els, motivation for working on MTurk, and whether workers used it as a primary or supplemental form of income.",

        "Munro and Tily (2011) compiled survey responses of 2,000 Turkers, revealing that four of the six most represented languages come from India (the top six being Hindi, Malayalam, Tamil, Spanish, French, and Telugu).",
        "Irvine and Klementiev (2010) had Turkers evaluate the accuracy of translations that had been automatically inducted from monolingual texts.",
        "They examined translations of 100 words in 42 low-resource languages, and reported geolocated countries for their workers (India, the US, Romania, Pakistan, Macedonia, Latvia, Bangladesh and the Philippines).",
        "Irvine and Klementiev discussed the difficulty of quality control and assessing the plausibility of workers?",
        "language skills for rare languages, which we address in this paper.",
        "Several researchers have investigated using MTurk to build bilingual parallel corpora for machine translation, a task which stands to benefit low cost, high volume translation on demand (Ger- mann, 2001).",
        "Ambati et al. (2010) conducted a pilot study by posting 25 sentences to MTurk for Span-ish, Chinese, Hindi, Telugu, Urdu, and Haitian Creole.",
        "In a study of 2000 Urdu sentences, Zaidan and Callison-Burch (2011) presented methods for achieving professional-level translation quality from Turkers by soliciting multiple English translations of each foreign sentence.",

        "Translation HIT For the translation task, we asked Turkers to translate individual words.",

        "A few languages stand out for having suspiciously strong performance by out of region workers, notably Irish and Swedish, for which out of region workers account for a near equivalent volume and quality of translations to the in region workers.",
        "This is admittedly implausible, considering the relatively small number of Irish speakers worldwide, and the very low number living in the countries in which our Turkers were based (primarily India).",
        "Such results highlight the fact that cheating using online translation resources is a real problem, and despite our best efforts to remove workers using Google Translate, some cheating is still evident.",

        "Since Mechanical Turk provides financial incentives for participation, many workers attempt to complete tasks even if they do not have the language skills necessary to do so.",

        "As a result naive data collection on MTurk may result in noisy data.",
        "A variety of techniques should be incorporated into crowdsourcing pipelines to ensure high quality data.",
        "As a best practice, we suggest: (1) restricting workers to countries that plausibly speak the foreign language of interest, (2) embedding gold standard controls or administering language pretests, rather than relying solely on self-reported language skills, and (3) excluding workers whose translations have high overlap with online machine translation systems like Google translate.",
        "If cheating using external resources is likely, then also consider (4) recording information like time spent on a HIT (cumulative and on individual items), patterns in keystroke logs, tab/window focus, etc.",
        "Although our study targeted bilingual workers on Mechanical Turk, and neglected monolingual work-ers, we believe our results reliably represent the current speaker populations, since the vast majority of the work available on the crowdsourced platform is currently English-only.",
        "We therefore assume the number of non-English speakers is small.",
        "In the fu-ture, it may be desirable to recruit monolingual foreign workers.",
