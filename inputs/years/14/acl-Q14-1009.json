        "instance, state of the art systems obtain tagging accuracies over 97% for part-of-speech (POS) tagging on the English Penn Treebank.",
        "However, learning accurate taggers without labeled data remains a challenge.",
        "The accuracies quickly drop when faced with data from a different domain, language, or when there is very little labeled information available for training (Banko and Moore, 2004).",
        "Recently, there has been an increasing amount of research tackling this problem using unsupervised methods.",
        "A popular approach is to learn from POS-tag dictionaries (Merialdo, 1994), where we are given a raw word sequence and a dictionary of legal tags for each word type.",
        "Learning from POS-tag dictionaries is still challenging.",
        "Complete word-tag dictionaries may not always be available for use and in every setting.",
        "When they are available, the dictionaries are often noisy, resulting in high tagging ambiguity.",
        "Furthermore, when applying taggers in new domains or different datasets, we may encounter new words that are missing from the dictionary.",
        "There have been some efforts to learn POS taggers from incomplete dictionaries by extending the dictionary to include these words using some heuristics (Toutanova and Johnson, 2008) or using other methods such as type-supervision (Garrette and Baldridge, 2012).",
        "In this work, we tackle the problem of unsupervised sequence labeling using tag dictionaries.",
        "The first reported work on this problem was on POS tagging from Merialdo (1994).",

        "More recent methods have yielded better performance than EM (see (Ravi and Knight, 2009) for an overview).",
        "One interesting line of research introduced by Ravi and Knight (2009) explores the idea of performing model minimization followed by EM training to learn taggers.",
        "Their idea is closely related to the classic Minimum Description Length principle for model selection (Barron et al., 1998).",
        "They (1) formulate an objective function to find the smallest model that explains the text (model minimization step), and then, (2) fit the minimized model to the data (EM step).",
        "For POS tagging, this method (Ravi and Knight, 2009) yields the best performance to date; 91.6% tagging accuracy on a standard test dataset from the English Penn Treebank.",
        "The original work from (Ravi and Knight, 2009) uses an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation to find minimal models, an approach which does not scale to large datasets.",
        "Ravi et al. (2010b) introduced a two-step greedy approximation to the original objective function (called the MIN-GREEDY algo-rithm) that runs much faster while maintaining the high tagging performance.",
        "Garrette and Baldridge (2012) showed how to use several heuristics to further improve this algorithm (for instance, better choice of tag bigrams when breaking ties) and stack other techniques on top, such as careful initialization of HMM emission models which results in further performance gains.",
        "Their method also works under incomplete dictionary scenarios and can be applied to certain low-resource scenarios (Garrette and Baldridge, 2013) by combining model minimization with supervised training.",
        "In this work, we propose a new scalable algorithm for performing model minimization for this task.",
        "By making an assumption on the structure of the solu-tion, we prove that a variant of the greedy set cover algorithm always finds an approximately optimal label set.",
        "This is in contrast to previous methods that employ heuristic approaches with no guarantee on the quality of the solution.",
        "In addition, we do not have to rely on ad hoc tie-breaking procedures or careful initializations for unknown words.",
        "Finally, not only is the proposed method approximately op-timal, it is also easy to distribute, allowing it to easily scale to very large datasets.",

        "We show that our method easily scales to both large data and grammar sizes, and does not require the corpus or label set to fit into memory.",

        "We demonstrate the power of the new method by evaluating under several different scenarios?POS tagging for multiple languages (including low-resource languages), with complete and incomplete dictionaries, as well as a complex sequence labeling task of su-pertagging.",
        "Our results show that for all these settings, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance yielding high quality taggings.",
        "2 Related Work Recently, there has been an increasing amount of research tackling this problem from multiple directions.",
        "Some efforts have focused on inducing POS tag clusters without any tags (Christodoulopou- los et al., 2010; Reichart et al., 2010; Moon et al., 2010), but evaluating such systems proves difficult since it is not straightforward to map the cluster labels onto gold standard tags.",
        "A more popular approach is to learn from POS-tag dictionaries (Merialdo, 1994; Ravi and Knight, 2009), incomplete dictionaries (Hasan and Ng, 2009; Garrette and Baldridge, 2012) and human-constructed dictionaries (Goldberg et al., 2008).",
        "106 Another direction that has been explored in the past includes bootstrapping taggers for a new language based on information acquired from other languages (Das and Petrov, 2011) or limited annotation resources (Garrette and Baldridge, 2013).",
        "Additional work focused on building supervised taggers for noisy domains such as Twitter (Gimpel et al., 2011).",
        "While most of the relevant work in this area centers on POS tagging, there has been some work done for building taggers for more complex sequence labeling tasks such as supertagging (Ravi et al., 2010a).",
        "Other related work include alternative methods for learning sparse models via priors in Bayesian inference (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007) and posterior regularization (Ganchev et al., 2010).",
        "But these methods only encourage sparsity and do not explicitly seek to minimize the model size, which is the objective function used in this work.",
        "Moreover, taggers learned using model minimization have been shown to produce state-of-the-art results for the problems discussed here.",
        "3 Model Following Ravi and Knight (2009), we formulate the problem as that of label selection on the sentence graph.",

        "The problem is closely related to the classical Set Cover problem and is also NP-complete.",

        "For example, if we label a word pair (wi,j?1, wij) as (NN, VP), then the label for the next word pair (wij , wi,j+1) has to be of the form (VP, *), i.e., it has to start with VP.",
        "Previous work (Ravi et al., 2010a; Ravi et al., 2010b) recognized this challenge and employed two phase heuristic approaches.",
        "Eschewing heuristics, we will show that with one natural assumption, even with this extra set of constraints, the standard greedy algorithm for this problem results in a solution with a provable approximation ratio of O(logm).",
        "In practice, however, the algorithm performs far better than the worst case ratio, and similar to the work of (Gomes et al., 2006), we find that the greedy approach selects a cover approximately 11% worse than the optimum solution.",
        "4.2 MLC Algorithm We present in Algorithm 1 our MINIMUM LABEL COVER algorithm to approximately solve the minimum label cover problem.",
        "The algorithm is simple, efficient, and easy to distribute.",
        "The algorithm chooses labels one at a time, selecting a label that covers as many words as possible in 108 every iteration.",
        "For this, it generates and maintains a multi-set of all possible labels M (Step 3).",
        "The multi-set contains an occurrence of each valid label, for example, if wi,j?1 has two possible valid tags NN and VP, and wij has one possible valid tag VP, then M will contain two labels, namely (NN, VP) and (VP, VP).",
        "Since M is a multi-set it will contain duplicates, e.g. the label (NN, VP) will appear for each adjacent pair of words that have NN and VP as valid tags, respectively.",
        "In each iteration, the algorithm picks a label with the most number of occurrences inM and adds it to the set of chosen labels (Step 6).",
        "Intuitively, this is a greedy step to select a label that covers the most number of word pairs.",
        "Once the algorithm picks a label (t?, t), it tries to assign as many words to tags t or t?",
        "as possible (Step 7).",
        "A word can be assigned t?",
        "if t?",
        "is a valid tag for it, and t a valid tag for the next word in sequence.",
        "Similarly, a word can be assigned t, if t is a valid tag for it, and t?",
        "a valid tag for the previous word.",
        "Some words can get both assignments, in which case we choose one tentatively at random (Step 8).",
        "If a word's tentative random tag, say t, is consistent with the choices of its adjacent words (say t?",
        "from the previous word), then the tentative choice is fixed as a permanent one.",
        "Whenever a tag is selected, the set of valid tags Tij for the word is reduced to a singleton {t}.",
        "Once the set of valid tags Tij changes, the multi-setM of all possible labels also changes, as seen from Eq 1.",
        "The multi-set is then recomputed (Step 9) and the iterations repeated until all of words have been tagged.",
        "We can show that under a natural assumption this simple algorithm is approximately optimal.",
        "Assumption 1 (c-feasibility).",
        "Let c ?",
        "1 be any num-ber, and k be the size of the optimal solution to the original problem.",
        "In each iteration, the MLC algorithm fixes the tags for some words.",
        "We say that the algorithm is c-feasible, if after each iteration there exists some solution to the remaining problem, consistent with the chosen tags, with size at most ck .",
        "The assumption encodes the fact that a single bad greedy choice is not going to destroy the overall structure of the solution, and a nearly optimal solution remains.",
        "We note that this assumption of c-feasibility is not only sufficient, as we will formally show, but is also necessary.",
        "Indeed, without any as-sumptions, once the algorithm fixes the tag for some words, an optimal label may no longer be consistent with the chosen tags, and it is not hard to find contrived examples where the size of the optimal solution doubles after each iteration of MLC.",
        "Since the underlying problem is NP-complete, it is computationally hard to give direct evidence verifying the assumption on natural language inputs.",
        "However, on small examples we are able to show that the greedy algorithm is within a small constant factor of the optimum, specifically it is within 11% of the optimum model size for the POS tagging problem using the standard 24k dataset (Ravi and Knight, 2009).",
        "Combined with the fact that the final method outperforms state of the art approaches, this leads us to conclude that the structural assumption is well justified.",

        "Our one step approach ensures consistency at each step of the algorithm, while the c-feasibility assumption means that the solution does not diverge too much from the optimal in each iteration.",
        "In addition to proving approximation guarantees for the new algorithm, we show that it is paralleliz-able, allowing us to easily scale to larger datasets than previously explored.",
        "Our results show that the algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods on several different tasks (both POS tagging and supertagging) and works well even with incomplete dictionaries and extremely low-resource languages like Malagasy.",
        "For future work, it would be interesting to apply a weighted version of the DMLC algorithm where labels (i.e., tag pairs) can have different weight distributions instead of uniform weights.",
        "Our algorithm can be extended to allow an input weight distribution to be specified for minimization.",
        "In order to initialize the weights we could use existing strategies such as grammar-informed initialization (Ravi et al., 2010a) or output distributions learnt via other methods such as label propagation (Garrette and Baldridge, 2013).",
