        "Sentiment-oriented relation extraction (Choi et al., 2006) is concerned with recognizing sentiment polarities and comparative relations between entities from natural language text.",
        "Identifying such relations often requires syntactic and semantic analysis at both sentence and phrase level.",
        "Most prior work on sentiment analysis consider either i) subjective sentence detection (Yu and K?bler, 2011), ii) polarity classification (Johansson and Moschitti, 2011; Wilson et al., 2005), or iii) comparative relation identification (Jindal and Liu, 2006; Ganapathibhotla and Liu, 2008).",
        "In practice, however, different types of sentiment-oriented relations frequently coexist in documents.",
        "In particular, we found that more than 38% of the sentences in our test corpus contain more than one type of relations.",
        "The isolated analysis approach is inappropriate because i) it sacrifices acuracy by ignoring the intricate interplay among different types of relations; ii) it could lead to conflicting predictions such as estimating a relation candidate as both negative and comparative.",
        "There-fore, in this paper, we identify instances of both sentiment polarities and comparative relations for entities of interest simultaneously.",
        "We assume that all the mentions of entities and attributes are given, and entities are disambiguated.",
        "It is a widely used assumption when evaluating a module in a pipeline system that the outputs of preceding modules are error-free.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, the only existing system capable of extracting both comparisons and sentiment polarities is a rule-based system proposed by Ding et al. (2009).",
        "We argue that it is better to tackle the task by using a unified model with structured outputs.",
        "It allows us to consider a set of correlated relation instances jointly and characterize their interaction through a set of soft and hard constraints.",
        "For example, we can encode constraints to discourage an attribute to participate in a polarity relation and a comparative relation at the same time.",
        "As a result, the system extracts a set of correlated instances of sentiment-oriented relations from a given sentence.",
        "For example, with the sentence about the camera Canon 7D, ?The sensor is great, but the price is higher than Nikon D7000.?",
        "the expected output is positive(Canon 7D, sensor) 155 Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2 (2014) 155?168.",
        "Action Editor: Janyce Wiebe.",
        "Submitted 6/2013; Revised 11/2013; Published 4/2014.",
        "c?2014 Association for Computational Linguistics.",
        "and preferred(Nikon D7000, Canon 7D, textit-price).",
        "However, constructing a fully annotated training corpus for this task is labor-intensive and requires strong linguistic background.",
        "We minimize this overhead by applying a simplified annotation scheme, in which annotators mark mentions of entities and attributes, disambiguate the entities, and label instances of relations for each sentence.",
        "Based on the new scheme, we have created a small Sentiment Relation Graph (SRG) corpus for the domains of cameras and movies, which significantly differs from the corpora used in prior work (Wei and Gulla, 2010; Kessler et al., 2010; Toprak et al., 2010; Wiebe et al., 2005; Hu and Liu, 2004) in the following ways: i) both sentiment polarities and comparative relations are annotated; ii) all mentioned entities are disambiguated; and iii) no subjective expressions are annotated, unless they are part of entity mentions.",
        "The new annotation scheme raises a new challenge for learning algorithms in that they need to automatically find textual evidences for each annotated relation during training.",
        "For example, with the sentence ?I like the Rebel a little better, but that is another price jump?, simply assigning a sentiment-bearing expression to the nearest relation candidate is insufficient, especially when the sentiment is not explicitly expressed.",
        "In this paper, we propose SENTI-LSSVM, a latent structural SVM based model for sentiment-oriented relation extraction.",
        "SENTI-LSSVM is applied to find the most likely set of the relation instances expressed in a given sentence, where the latent variables are used to assign the most appropriate textual evidences to the respective instances.",
        "In summary, the contributions of this paper are the following: ?",
        "We propose SENTI-LSSVM: the first unified statistical model with the capability of extracting instances of both binary and ternary sentiment-oriented relations.",
        "?",
        "We design a task-specific integer linear programming (ILP) formulation for inference.",
        "?",
        "We construct a new SRG corpus as a valuable asset for the evaluation of sentiment relation extraction.",
        "?",
        "We conduct extensive experiments with online reviews and forum posts, showing that SENTI-LSSVM model can effectively learn from a training corpus without explicitly annotated subjective expressions and that its performance significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems.",
        "2 Related Work There are ample works on analyzing sentiment polarities and entity comparisons, but the majority of them studied the two tasks in isolation.",
        "Most prior approaches for fine-grained sentiment analysis focus on polarity classification.",
        "Supervised approaches on expression-level analysis require the annotation of sentiment-bearing expressions as training data (Jin et al., 2009; Choi and Cardie, 2010; Johansson and Moschitti, 2011; Yessenalina and Cardie, 2011; Wei and Gulla, 2010).",
        "However, the corresponding annotation process is time-consuming.",
        "Although sentence-level annotations are easier to obtain, the analysis at this level cannot cope with sentences conveying relations of multiple types (McDonald et al., 2007; T?ckstr?m and McDonald, 2011; Socher et al., 2012).",
        "Lexicon-based approaches require no training data (Ku et al., 2006; Kim and Hovy, 2006; Godbole et al., 2007; Ding et al., 2008; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Liu et al., 2005) but suffer from inferior performance (Wil- son et al., 2005; Qu et al., 2012).",
        "In contrast, our method requires no annotation of sentiment-bearing expressions for training and can predict both sentiment polarities and comparative relations.",
        "Sentiment-oriented comparative relations have been studied in the context of user-generated discourse (Jindal and Liu, 2006; Ganapathibhotla and Liu, 2008).",
        "Approaches rely on linguistically motivated rules and assume the existence of independent keywords in sentences which indicate comparative relations.",
        "Therefore, these methods fall short of extracting comparative relations based on domain dependent information.",
        "Both Johansson and Moschitti (2011) and Wu et al. (2011) formulate fine-grained sentiment analysis as a learning problem with structured outputs.",
        "However, they focus only on polarity classification 156 of expressions and require annotation of sentiment-bearing expressions for training as well.",
        "While ILP has been previously applied for inference in sentiment analysis (Choi and Cardie, 2009; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009; Wu et al., 2011), our task requires a complete ILP reformulation due to 1) the absence of annotated sentiment expressions and 2) the constraints imposed by the joint extraction of both sentiment polarity and comparative relations.",
        "3 System Overview This section gives an overview of the whole system for extracting sentiment-oriented relation instances.",
        "Prior to presenting the system architecture, we introduce the essential concepts and the definitions of two kinds of directed hypergraphs as the representation of correlated relation instances extracted from sentences.",
        "3.1 Concepts and Definitions Entity.",
        "An entity is an abstract or concrete thing, which needs not be of material existence.",
        "An entity in this paper refers to either a product or a brand.",
        "Attribute.",
        "An attribute is an object closely associated with or belonging to an entity, such as the lens of digital camera.",
        "Sentiment-Oriented Relation.",
        "A sentiment-oriented relation is either a sentiment polarity or a comparative relation, defined on tuples of entities and attributes.",
        "A sentiment polarity relation conveys either a positive or a negative attitude towards entities or their attributes, whereas a comparative relation indicates the preference of one entity over the other entity w.r.t.",
        "an attribute.",
        "Relation Instance.",
        "An instance of sentiment polarity takes the form r(entity, attribute) with r ?",
        "{pos- itive, negative}, such as positive(Canon 7D, sen-sor).",
        "The polarity instances expressed in the form of unary relations, such as ?Nikon D7000 is excellent.",
        "?, are denoted as binary relations r(entity, whole), where the attribute whole indicates the entity as a whole.",
        "In contrast, an instance of comparative relation is in the form of preferred{entity, en-tity, attribute}, e.g. preferred(Canon 7D, Nikon D7000, price).",
        "For brevity, we refer to an instance set of sentiment-oriented relations extracted from a sentence as an sSoR.",
        "To represent the instances of the remaining relations, we represent them as other{entity, attribute}, such as textitpartOf{wheel, car}.",
        "These relations include objective relations and the subjective relations other than sentiment-oriented relations.",
        "Mention-Based Relation Instances.",
        "A mention-based relation instance refers to a tuple of entity mentions with a certain relation.",
        "This concept is introduced as the representation of instances in a sentence by replacing entities with the corresponding entity mentions, such as positive(?Canon SD880i?, ?wide angle view?).",
        "Figure 1: An example of MRG.",
        "Mention-Based Relation Graph.",
        "A mention-based relation graph (or MRG ) represents a collection of mention-based relation instances expressed in a sentence.",
        "As illustrated in Figure 1, an MRG is a directed hypergraph G = ?M,E?",
        "with a vertex set M and an edge set E. A vertex mi ?",
        "M denotes a mention of an entity or an attribute occurring either within the sentence or in its context.",
        "We say that a mention is from the context if it is mentioned in the previous sentence or is an attribute implied in the current sentence.",
        "An instance of a binary relation in an MRG takes the form of a binary edge el = (mi,ma), where mi and ma denote an entity mention and an attribute mention respectively, and the type l ?",
        "{positive, negative, other}.",
        "A ternary edge el indicating comparative relation is represented as el = (mi,mj ,ma), where two entity mentions mi and mj are compared with respect to the attribute mention ma.",
        "We define the type l ?",
        "{better,worse} to indicate two possible directions of the relation and assume mi occurs before mj .",
        "As a result, we have a set L of five relation types: positive, negative, better, worse or other.",
        "According to these definitions, the annotations in the SRG corpus are actually MRGs and disambiguated entities.",
        "If there are multiple mentions referring to the same entity, annotators are asked to choose the 157 most obvious one because it saves annotation time and is less demanding for the entity recognition and diambiguation modules.",
        "Figure 2: An example of eMRG.",
        "The textual evidences are wrapped by green dashed boxes.",
        "Evidentiary Mention-Based Relation Graph.",
        "An evidentiary mention-based relation graph, coined eMRG , extends an MRG by associating each edge with a textual evidence to support the corresponding relation assertions (see Figure 2).",
        "Consequently, an edge in an eMRG is denoted by a pair (a, c), where a represents a mention-based relation instance and c is the associated textual evidence.",
        "It is also referred to as an evidentiary edge.",
        "represented as el = (mi,mj ,ma), an MRG as an evidentiary MRG (eMRG) and the edges of eMRGs as evidentiary edges, as shown in Figure 2.",
        "3.2 System Architecture Figure 3: System architecture.",
        "As illustrated by Figure 3, at the core of our system is the SENTI-LSSVM model, which extracts sets of mention-based relationships in the form of eMRGs from sentences.",
        "For a given sentence with known entity mentions, we select all possible mention sets as relation candidates, where each set includes at least one entity mention.",
        "Then we associate each relation candidate with a set of constituents or the whole sentence as the textual evidence candidates (cf.",
        "Section 6.1).",
        "Subsequently, the inference component aims to find the most likely eMRG from all possible combinations of mention-based relation instances and their textual evidences (cf.",
        "Section 6.2).",
        "The representation eMRG is chosen because it characterizes exactly the model outputs by letting each edge correspond to an instance of mention-based relation and the associated textual evidence.",
        "Finally, the model parameters of this model are learned by an online algorithm (cf.",
        "Section 7).",
        "Since instance sets of sentiment-oriented relations (sSoRs) are the expected outputs, we can obtain sSoRs from MRGs by using a simple rule-based algorithm.",
        "The algorithm essentially maps the mentions from an MRG into entities and attributes in an sSoR and label the corresponding tuples with the relation types of the edges from an MRG.",
        "For instances of comparative relation, the label better or worse is mapped to the relation type preferred.",
        "4 SENTI-LSSVM Model The task of sentiment-oriented relation extraction is to determine the most likely sSoR in a sentence.",
        "Since sSoRs are derived from the corresponding MRGs as described in Section 3, the task is reduced to find the most likely MRG for each sentence.",
        "Since an MRG is created by assigning relation types to a subset of all relation candidates, which are possible tuples of mentions with unknown relation types, the number of MRGs can be extremely high.",
        "To tackle the task, one solution is to employ an edge-factored linear model in the framework of structural SVM (Martins et al., 2009; Tsochantaridis et al., 2004).",
        "The model suggests that a bag of features should be specified for each relation candidate, and then the model predicts the most likely candidate sets along with their relation types to form the optimal MRGs.",
        "As we observed, for a relation can-didate, the most informative features are the words near its entity mentions in the original text.",
        "How-158 ever, if we represent a candidate by all these words, it is very likely that the instances of different relation types share overly similar features, because a mention is often involved in more than one relation can-didate, as shown in Figure 2.",
        "As a consequence, the instances of different relations represented by overly similar features can easily confuse the learning algorithm.",
        "Thus, it is critical to select proper constituents or sentences as textual evidences for each relation candidate in both training and testing.",
        "Consequently, we divide the task of sentiment-oriented relation extraction into two subtasks : i) identifying the most likely MRGs; ii) assigning proper textual evidences to each edge of MRGs to support their relation assertions.",
        "It is desirable to carry out the two subtasks jointly as these two subtasks could enhance each other.",
        "First, the identification of relation types requires proper textual ev-idences; second, the soft and hard constraints imposed by the correlated relation instances facilitate the recognition of the corresponding textual evidences.",
        "Since the eMRGs are created by attaching every MRG with a set of textual evidences, tackling the two subtasks simultaneously is equivalent to selecting the most likely eMRG from a set of eMRG candidates.",
        "It is challenging because our SRG corpus does not contain any annotation of textual evidences.",
        "Formally, let X denote the set of all available sen-tences, and we define y ?",
        "Y(x)(x ?",
        "X ) as the set of labeled edges of an MRG and Y = ?x?XY(x).",

        "The output of the first predictor is an integer value, while the output of the second predictor is a sentiment relation, such as ?positive?, 159 ?negative?, ?better?",
