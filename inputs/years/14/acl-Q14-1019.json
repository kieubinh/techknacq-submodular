        "Abstract",
        "Entity Linking (EL) and Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) both address the lexical ambiguity of language.",
        "But while the two tasks are pretty similar, they differ in a fundamental respect: in EL the textual mention can be linked to a named entity which may or may not contain the exact mention, while in WSD there is a perfect match between the word form (bet- ter, its lemma) and a suitable word sense.",
        "In this paper we present Babelfy, a unified graph-based approach to EL and WSD based on a loose identification of candidate meanings coupled with a densest subgraph heuristic which selects high-coherence semantic interpretations.",
        "Our experiments show state-of-the-art performances on both tasks on 6 different datasets, including a multilingual setting.",
        "Babelfy is online at http://babelfy.org 1 Introduction The automatic understanding of the meaning of text has been a major goal of research in computational linguistics and related areas for several decades, with ambitious challenges, such as Machine Reading (Etzioni et al., 2006) and the quest for knowledge (Schubert, 2006).",
        "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) (Navigli, 2009; Navigli, 2012) is a historical task aimed at assigning meanings to single-word and multi-word occurrences within text, a task which is more alive than ever in the research community.",
        "Recently, the collaborative creation of large semi-structured resources, such as Wikipedia, and knowledge resources built from them (Hovy et al., 2013), such as BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012a), DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007) and YAGO2 (Hoffart et al., 2013), has favoured the emergence of new tasks, such as Entity Linking (EL) (Rao et al., 2013), and opened up new possibilities for tasks such as Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) and Wikifi-cation.",
        "The aim of EL is to discover mentions of entities within a text and to link them to the most suitable entry in a reference knowledge base.",
        "How-ever, in contrast to WSD, a mention may be partial while still being unambiguous thanks to the context.",
        "For instance, consider the following sentence: (1) Thomas and Mario are strikers playing in Munich.",
        "This example makes it clear how intertwined the two tasks of WSD and EL are.",
        "In fact, on the one hand, striker and play are polysemous words which can be disambiguated by selecting the game/soccer playing senses of the two words in a dictionary; on the other hand, Thomas and Mario are partial mentions which have to be linked to the appropriate entries of a knowledge base, that is, Thomas Mu?ller and Mario Gomez, two well-known soccer players.",
        "The two main differences between WSD and EL lie, on the one hand, in the kind of inventory used, i.e., dictionary vs. encyclopedia, and, on the other hand, in the assumption that the mention is complete or potentially partial.",
        "Notwithstanding these differ-ences, the tasks are similar in nature, in that they both involve the disambiguation of textual fragments according to a reference inventory.",
        "However, the research community has so far tackled the two tasks separately, often duplicating efforts and solutions.",
        "In contrast to this trend, research in knowledge acquisition is now heading towards the seamless in-231 Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2 (2014) 231?244.",
        "Action Editor: Noah Smith.",

        "tegration of encyclopedic and lexicographic knowledge into structured language resources (Hovy et al., 2013), and the main representative of this new direction is undoubtedly BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012a).",
        "Given such structured language resources it seems natural to suppose that they might provide a common ground for the two tasks of WSD and EL.",
        "More precisely, in this paper we explore the hypothesis that the lexicographic knowledge used in WSD is also useful for tackling the EL task, and, vice versa, that the encyclopedic information utilized in EL helps disambiguate nominal mentions in a WSD setting.",
        "We propose Babelfy, a novel, unified graph-based approach to WSD and EL, which performs two main steps: i) it exploits random walks with restart, and triangles as a support for reweight-ing the edges of a large semantic network; ii) it uses a densest subgraph heuristic on the available semantic interpretations of the input text to perform a joint disambiguation with both concepts and named entities.",
        "Our experiments show the benefits of our synergistic approach on six gold-standard datasets.",
        "2 Related Work 2.1 Word Sense Disambiguation Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the task of choosing the right sense for a word within a given context.",
        "Typical approaches for this task can be classified as i) supervised, ii) knowledge-based, and iii) unsupervised.",
        "However, supervised approaches require huge amounts of annotated data (Zhong and Ng, 2010; Shen et al., 2013; Pilehvar and Navigli, 2014), an effort which cannot easily be repeated for new domains and languages, while unsupervised ones suffer from data sparsity and an intrinsic difficulty in their evaluation (Agirre et al., 2006; Brody and Lapata, 2009; Manandhar et al., 2010; Van de Cruys and Apidianaki, 2011; Di Marco and Nav-igli, 2013).",
        "On the other hand, knowledge-based approaches are able to obtain good performance using readily-available structured knowledge (Agirre et al., 2010; Guo and Diab, 2010; Ponzetto and Nav-igli, 2010; Miller et al., 2012; Agirre et al., 2014).",
        "Some of these approaches marginally take into account the structural properties of the knowledge base (Mihalcea, 2005).",
        "Other approaches, instead, leverage the structural properties of the knowledge base by exploiting centrality and connectivity measures (Sinha and Mihalcea, 2007; Tsatsaronis et al., 2007; Agirre and Soroa, 2009; Navigli and Lapata, 2010).",
        "One of the key steps of many knowledge-based WSD algorithms is the creation of a graph representing the semantic interpretations of the input text.",
        "Two main strategies to build this graph have been proposed: i) exploiting the direct connections, i.e., edges, between the considered sense candidates; ii) populating the graph according to (shortest) paths between them.",
        "In our approach we manage to unify these two strategies by automatically creating edges between sense candidates performing Random Walk with Restart (Tong et al., 2006).",
        "The recent upsurge of interest in multilinguality has led to the development of cross-lingual and multilingual approaches to WSD (Lefever and Hoste, 2010; Lefever and Hoste, 2013; Navigli et al., 2013).",
        "Multilinguality has been exploited in different ways, e.g., by using parallel corpora to build multilingual contexts (Guo and Diab, 2010; Banea and Mihalcea, 2011; Lefever et al., 2011) or by means of ensemble methods which exploit complementary sense evidence from translations in different languages (Nav- igli and Ponzetto, 2012b).",
        "In this work, we present a novel exploitation of the structural properties of a multilingual semantic network.",
        "2.2 Entity Linking Entity Linking (Erbs et al., 2011; Rao et al., 2013; Cornolti et al., 2013) encompasses a set of similar tasks, which include Named Entity Disambiguation (NED), that is the task of linking entity mentions in a text to a knowledge base (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006; Cucerzan, 2007), and Wikification, i.e., the automatic annotation of text by linking its relevant fragments of text to the appropriate Wikipedia articles.",
        "Mihalcea and Csomai (2007) were the first to tackle the Wikification task.",
        "In their approach they disambiguate each word in a sentence independently by exploiting the context in which it occurs.",
        "How-ever, this approach is local in that it lacks a collective notion of coherence between the selected Wikipedia pages.",
        "To overcome this problem, Cucerzan (2007) introduced a global approach based on the simultaneous disambiguation of all the terms in a text and the use of lexical context to disambiguate the mentions.",
        "To maximize the semantic agreement Milne 232 and Witten (2008) introduced the analysis of the semantic relations between the candidate senses and the unambiguous context, i.e., words with a single sense candidate.",
        "However, the performance of this algorithm depends heavily on the number of links incident to the target senses and on the availability of unambiguous words within the input text.",
        "To overcome this issue a novel class of approaches have been proposed (Kulkarni et al., 2009; Ratinov et al., 2011; Hoffart et al., 2011) that exploit global and local features.",
        "However, these systems either rely on a difficult NP-hard formalization of the problem which is infeasible for long text, or exploit popularity measures which are domain-dependent.",
        "In con-trast, we show that the semantic network structure can be leveraged to obtain state-of-the-art performance by synergistically disambiguating both word senses and named entities at the same time.",
        "Recently, the explosion of on-line social networking services, such as Twitter and Facebook, have contributed to the development of new methods for the efficient disambiguation of short texts (Ferrag- ina and Scaiella, 2010; Hoffart et al., 2012; Bo?hm et al., 2012).",
        "Thanks to a loose candidate identification technique coupled with a densest subgraph heuristic, we show that our approach is particularly suited for short and highly ambiguous text disambiguation.",
        "2.3 The Best of Two Worlds Our main goal is to bring together the two worlds of WSD and EL.",
        "On the one hand, this implies relaxing the constraint of a perfect association between mentions and meanings, which is, instead, assumed in WSD.",
        "On the other hand, this relaxation leads to the inherent difficulty of encoding a full-fledged sense inventory for EL.",
        "Our solution to this problem is to keep the set of candidate meanings for a given mention as open as possible (see Section 6), so as to enable high recall in linking partial mentions, while providing an effective method for handling this high ambiguity (see Section 7).",
        "A key assumption of our work is that the lexicographic knowledge used in WSD is also useful for tackling the EL task, and vice versa the encyclopedic information utilized in EL helps disambiguate nominal mentions in a WSD setting.",
        "We enable the joint treatment of concepts and named entities by enforcing high coherence in our semantic interpretations.",
        "3 WSD and Entity Linking Together Task.",
        "Our task is to disambiguate and link all nominal and named entity mentions occurring within a text.",
        "The linking task is performed by associating each mention with the most suitable entry of a given knowledge base.1 We point out that our definition is unconstrained in terms of what to link, i.e., unlike Wikification and WSD, we can link overlapping fragments of text.",
        "For instance, given the text fragment Major League Soccer, we identify and disambiguate several different nominal and entity mentions: Major League Soccer, major league, league and soccer.",
        "In contrast to EL, we link not only named entity mentions, such as Major League Soccer, but also nominal mentions, e.g., major league, to their corresponding meanings in the knowledge base.",
        "Babelfy.",
        "We provide a unified approach to WSD and entity linking in three steps: 1.",
        "Given a lexicalized semantic network, we associate with each vertex, i.e., either concept or named entity, a semantic signature, that is, a set of related vertices (Section 5).",
        "This is a preliminary step which needs to be performed only once, independently of the input text.",
        "2.",
        "Given a text, we extract all the linkable fragments from this text and, for each of them, list the possible meanings according to the semantic network (Section 6).",
        "3.",
        "We create a graph-based semantic interpretation of the whole text by linking the candidate meanings of the extracted fragments using the previously-computed semantic signatures.",
        "We then extract a dense subgraph of this representation and select the best candidate meaning for each fragment (Section 7).",
        "4 Semantic Network Our approach requires the availability of a wide-coverage semantic network which encodes structural and lexical information both of an encyclopedic and of a lexicographic kind.",
        "Although in principle any semantic network with these properties 1Mentions which are not contained in the reference knowledge base are not taken into account.",
        "233 could be utilized, in our work we used the Babel-Net2 1.1.1 semantic network (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012a) since it is the largest multilingual knowledge base, obtained from the automatic seamless integration of Wikipedia3 and WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "We consider BabelNet as a directed multi-graph which contains both concepts and named entities as its vertices and a multiset of semantic relations as its edges.",
        "We leverage the multilingual lexicalizations of the vertices of BabelNet to identify mentions in the input text.",
        "For example, the entity FC Bayern Munich can be lexicalized in different languages, e.g., F.C.",
        "Bayern de Mu?nich in Spanish, Die Roten in English and Bayern Mu?nchen in Ger-man, among others.",
        "As regards semantic relations, the only information we use is that of the end points, i.e., vertices, that these relations connect, while neglecting the relation type.",
        "5 Building Semantic Signatures One of the major issues affecting both manually-curated and automatically constructed semantic networks is data sparsity.",
        "For instance, we calculated that the average number of incident edges is roughly 10 in WordNet, 50 in BabelNet and 80 in YAGO2, to mention a few.",
        "Although automatically-built resources typically provide larger amounts of edges, two issues have to be taken into account: concepts which should be related might not be directly connected despite being structurally close within the network, and, vice versa, weakly-related or even unrelated concepts can be erroneously connected by an edge.",
        "For instance, in BabelNet we do not have an edge between playmaker and Thomas Mu?ller, while we have an incorrect edge connecting FC Bayern Munich and Yellow Submarine (song).",
        "However, this crisp notion of relatedness can be overcome by exploiting the global structure of the semantic net-work, thereby obtaining a more precise and higher-coverage measure of relatedness.",
        "We address this issue in two steps: first, we provide a structural weighting of the network's edges; second, for each vertex we create a set of related vertices using random walks with restart.",
        "2http://babelnet.org 3http://www.wikipedia.org Structural weighting.",
        "Our first objective is to assign higher weights to edges which are involved in more densely connected areas of the directed network.",
        "To this end, inspired by the local clustering coefficient measure (Watts and Strogatz, 1998) and its recent success in Word Sense Induction (Di Marco and Navigli, 2013), we use directed tri-angles, i.e., directed cycles of length 3, and weight each edge (v, v?)",
        "by the number of directed triangles it occurs in: weight(v, v?)",
        ":= |{(v, v?, v??)",
        ": (v, v?",
        "), (1) (v?, v??",
        "), (v?",
        "?, v) ?",
        "E}|+ 1 We add one to each weight to ensure the highest degree of reachability in the network.",
        "Random Walk with Restart.",
        "Our goal is to create a semantic signature (i.e., a set of highly related vertices) for each concept and named entity of the semantic network.",
        "To do this, we perform a Random Walk with Restart (RWR) (Tong et al., 2006), that is, a stochastic process that starts from an initial vertex of the graph4 and then, for a fixed number n of steps or until convergence, explores the graph by choosing the next vertex within the current neighborhood or by restarting from the initial vertex with a given, fixed restart probability ?.",
        "For each edge (v, v?)",
        "in the network, we model the conditional probability P (v?|v) as the normalized weight of the edge: P (v?|v) = weight(v, v ?)?",
        "v??",
        "?V weight(v, v??)",
        "where V is the set of vertices of the semantic network and weight(v, v?)",
        "is the function defined in Equation 1.",
        "We then run the RWR from each vertex v of the semantic network for a fixed number n of steps (we show in Algorithm 1 our RWR pseu-docode).",
        "We keep track of the encountered vertices using the map counts, i.e., we increase the counter associated with vertex v?",
        "in counts every time we hit v?",
        "during a RWR started from v (see line 11).",
        "As a result, we obtain a frequency distribution over the whole set of concepts and entities.",
        "To eliminate weakly-related vertices we keep only those items that were hit at least ?",
        "times (see lines 16?18).",
        "Finally, we save the remaining vertices in the set semSignv which is the semantic signature of v (see line 19).",
        "4RWR can be used with an initial set of vertices, however in this paper we use a single initial vertex.",
        "234 Algorithm 1 Random walk with restart.",

        "from counts.keys() 19: return semSignv = counts.keys() The creation of our set of semantic signatures, one for each vertex in the semantic network, is a preliminary step carried out once only before starting processing any input text.",
        "We now turn to the candidate identification and disambiguation steps.",
        "6 Candidate Identification Given a text as input, we apply part-of-speech tagging and identify the set F of all the textual frag-ments, i.e., all the sequences of words of maximum length five, which contain at least one noun and that are substrings of lexicalizations in BabelNet, i.e., those fragments that can potentially be linked to an entry in BabelNet.",
        "For each textual fragment f ?",
        "F , i.e., a single-or multi-word expression of the input text, we look up the semantic network for candidate meanings, i.e., vertices that contain f or, only for named entities, a superstring of f as their lexical-ization.",
        "For instance, for sentence (1) in the intro-duction, we identify the following textual fragments: Thomas, Mario, strikers, Munich.",
        "This output is obtained thanks to our loose candidate identification routine, i.e., based on superstring matching instead of exact matching, which, for instance, enables us to recognize the right candidate Mario Gomez for the mention Mario even if this named entity does not have Mario as one of its lexicalizations (for an analysis of the impact of this routine against the exact matching approach see the discussion in Section 9).",
        "Moreover, as we stated in Section 3, we allow overlapping fragments, e.g., for major league we recognize league and major league.",
        "We denote with cand(f) the set of all the candidate meanings of fragment f .",
        "For instance, for the noun league we have that cand(league) contains among others the sport word sense and the TV series named entity.",
        "7 Candidate Disambiguation Semantic interpretation graph.",
        "After the identification of fragments (F ) and their candidate meanings (cand(?",
        ")), we create a directed graph GI = (VI , EI) of the semantic interpretations of the input text.",
        "We show the pseudocode in Algorithm 2.",
        "VI contains all the candidate meanings of all fragments, that is, VI := {(v, f) : v ?",
        "cand(f), f ?",
        "F}, where f is a fragment of the input text and v is a candidate Babel synset that has a lexicalization which is equal to or is a superstring of f (see lines 4?8).",
        "The set of edges EI connects related meanings and is populated as follows: we add an edge from (v, f) to (v?, f ?)",

        "?",
        "semSignv (see lines 9?11).",
        "In other words, we connect two candidate meanings of different fragments if one is in the semantic signature of the other.",
        "For instance, we add an edge between (Mario Gomez, Mario) and (Thomas Mu?ller, Thomas), while we do not add one between (Mario Gomez, Mario) and (Mario Basler, Mario) since these are two candidate meanings of the same fragment, i.e., Mario.",
        "In Figure 1, we show an excerpt of our graph for sentence (1).",
        "At this point we have a graph-based representation of all the possible interpretations of the input text.",
        "In order to drastically reduce the degree of ambiguity while keeping the interpretation coherence as high as possible, we apply a novel densest subgraph heuristic (see line 12), whose description we defer to the next paragraph.",
        "The result is a subgraph which contains those semantic interpretations that are most coherent to each other.",
        "However, this subgraph might still contain multiple interpretations for the same fragment, and even unambiguous fragments which are not correct.",

        "This shows the need for our novel unified approach to EL and WSD.",
        "At the core of our approach lies the effective treatment of the high degree of ambiguity of partial textual mentions by means of a 2-approximation algorithm for the densest subgraph problem, which enables us to output a semantic interpretation of the input text with drastically reduced ambiguity, as was previously done with SSI (Navigli, 2008).",
        "Our experiments on six gold-standard datasets show the state-of-the-art performance of our ap-proach, as well as its robustness across languages.",
        "Our evaluation also demonstrates that our approach fares well both on long texts, such as those of the WSD tasks, and short and highly-ambiguous sen-tences, such as the ones in KORE50.",
        "Finally, ablation tests and further analysis demonstrate that each component of our system is needed to contribute state-of-the-art performances on both EL and WSD.",
        "As future work, we plan to use Babelfy for information extraction, where semantics is taking the lead (Moro and Navigli, 2013), and for the validation of semantic annotations (Vannella et al., 2014).",
