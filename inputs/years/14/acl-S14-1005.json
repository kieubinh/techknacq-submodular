        "Inspired by the Sudoku puz-zle, it significantly improves the precision and recall of disambiguation.",
        "We describe how conventional subgraph-based WSD treats the two steps of (1) subgraph construction and (2) disambiguation via graph centrality measures as ordered and atomic.",
        "Consequently, researchers tend to focus on improving either of these two steps indi-vidually, overlooking the fact that these steps can complement each other if they are allowed to interact in an iterative manner.",
        "We tested our iterative approach against the conventional approach for a range of well-known graph centrality measures and subgraph types, at the sentence and document level.",
        "The results demonstrated that an average performing WSD system which embraces the iterative ap-proach, can easily compete with state-of-the-art.",
        "This alone warrants further investigation."

        "As Pedersen (2007) rightly states, supervised systems are bound by their training data, and therefore are limited in portability and flexibility in the face of new domains, changing applications, or different languages.",
        "This knowledge acquisition bottleneck, coined by Gale et al. (1992), can be alleviated by unsupervised systems that exploit the portability and flexibility of Lexical Knowledge Bases (LKBs).",
        "As of 2007, SENSEVAL became SEMEVAL, offering a more diverse range of semantic tasks.",
        "Unsupervised knowledge-based WSD has since had its performance evaluated in terms of granularity (Navigli et al., 2007), domain (Agirre et al., 2010), and cross/multi-linguality (Lefever and Hoste, 2010; Lefever and Hoste, 2013; Navigli et al., 2013).",
        "Results from these tasks have demonstrated unsupervised systems are now a competitive and robust alternative to supervised systems, especially given the ever changing task-orientated settings WSD is evaluated in.",
        "One such class of unsupervised knowledge-based WSD systems that we seek to improve in this paper constructs semantic subgraphs from LKBs, and then runs graph-based centrality measures such as PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) over them to finally select the senses (as nodes) ranked as the most relevant.",
        "This class is known as subgraph-based WSD, characterised over the last decade by performing the two key steps of (1) subgraph construction and (2) disambiguation via graph centrality measures, in an ordered atomic sequence.",
        "We refer to this characteristic as the conventional approach to subgraph-based WSD.",
