        "Word space models such as LSA (Landauer and Dumais, 1997) and HAL (Lund et al., 1995) have been shown to identify semantic relations from corpus data quite effectively.",
        "However, the performance of such models depends on the parameters used to construct the word space.",
        "In the case of HAL, parameters such as the size of the context window can have a significant impact on the ability of the model to identify semantic relations and on the types of relations (e.g. paradigmatic or syntagmatic) captured.",
        "In this paper, we describe a method of encoding cooccurrence information which employs a three-way tensor instead of a matrix.",
        "Because the tensor explicitly encodes the distance between a target word and the context words that co-occur with it, it allows us to extract matrices corresponding to HAL models with different context windows without repeatedly processing the whole corpus, but it also allows us to experiment with different kinds of word spaces.",
        "We describe one method whereby features are selected in different slices of the tensor corresponding to different distances between the target and context words, and another which uses SVD for dimensionality reduction.",
        "Models ",
        "Licence details: http: //creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ are evaluated and compared on reference data extracted from a specialized dictionary of the environment domain, as our target application is the identification of lexico-semantic relations in specialized corpora.",
        "Preliminary results suggest the tensor-based methods are more robust than the basic HAL model in some respects.",
        "2 Related Work The tensor encoding method we describe is based on the Hyperspace Analogue to Language, or HAL, model (Lund et al., 1995; Lund and Burgess, 1996), which has been shown to be particularly effective at modeling paradigmatic relations such as synonymy.",
        "In the HAL model, word order is taken into account insofar as the word vectors it produces contain information about both the cooccurrents that precede a word and those that follow it.",
        "In recent years, there have been several proposals that aim to add word order information to models that rely mainly on word context information (Jones and Mewhort, 2007; Sahlgren et al., 2008), including models based on multi-way tensors.",
        "Symonds et al. (2011) proposed an efficient tensor encoding method which builds on unstructured word space models (i.e. models based on simple cooccurrence rather than syntactic struc-ture) by adding order information.",
        "The method we describe differs in that it explicitly encodes the distance between a target word and its cooccurrents.",
        "Multi-way tensors have been used to construct different kinds of word space models in recent years.",
        "Turney (2007) used a word-word-pattern tensor to model semantic similarity, Van de Cruys (2009) used a tensor containing corpus-derived subject-verb-object triples to model selectional preferences, and Baroni and Lenci (2010) proposed a general, tensor-based framework for structured word space models.",
        "The tensor encoding method we describe differs in that it is based on an unstructured word space model, HAL.",
        "57 3 HAL The HAL model employs a sliding context window to compute a word-word cooccurrence ma-trix, which we will note A, in which value a ij is based on the number of times context word w j appears within the context window of target word w i .",
        "Thus, words that share cooccurrents will be closer in word space.",
        "If equal weight is given to all context words in the window, regardless of distance, we call the context window rectangular.",
        "In the original HAL model, the values added to A are inversely proportional to the distance between the target word and context word in a given context.",
        "In this case, the context window is triangular.",
        "In the HAL model, the cooccurrence matrix is computed by considering only the context words that occur before the target word.",
        "Once the matrix has been computed, row vector a i: contains cooccurrence information about words preceding w i , and column vector a :i contains information about those that follow it.",
        "The row vector and column vector of each target word are concate-nated, such that the resulting word vectors contain information about both left-cooccurrents and right-cooccurrents.",
        "We call this type of context window directional, following (Sahlgren, 2006), as opposed to a symetric context window, in which cooccurrence counts in the left and right contexts are summed.",
        "In our experiment, we only use one type of context window (directional and rectangu-lar), but models corresponding to different types of context windows can be derived from the cooccurrence tensor we describe in section 4.",
        "Once the values in A have been computed, they can be weighted using schemes such as TF-ITF (Lavelli et al., 2004) and Positive Pointwise Mutual Information (PPMI), which we use here as it has been shown to be particularly effective by Bullinaria and Levy (2007).",
        "Finally, a distance or similarity measure is used to compare word vectors.",
        "Lund and Burgess (1996) use Minkowski distances.",
        "We will use the cosine similarity, as did Sch?utze (1992) in a model similar to HAL and which directly influenced its development.",
        "4 The Cooccurrence Tensor In the following description of the cooccurrence tensor, we follow the notational guidelines of (Kolda, 2006), as in (Turney, 2007; Baroni and Lenci, 2010).",
        "Let W be the vocabulary 1 , which we index by i to refer to a target word and by j for context words.",
        "Furthermore, let P , indexed by k, be a set of positions, relative to a target word w i , in which a context word w j can co-occur with w i .",
        "In other words, this is the signed distance between w j and w i , in number of words.",
        "For instance, in the sentence ?a dog bit the mailman?, we would say that ?dog?",
        "co-occurs with ?bit?",
        "in position?1.",
        "If we only consider the words directly adjacent to a target word, then P = {?1,+1}.",
        "If the tensor encoding method is used to generate HAL-style cooccurrence matrices corresponding to different context windows, then P would include all positions in the largest window under consideration.",
        "In a cooccurrence matrix A, a ij contains the frequency at which word w j co-occurs with word w i in a fixed context window.",
        "Rather than computing matrices using fixed-size context windows, we can construct a cooccurrence tensor X, a labeled three-way tensor in which values x ijk indicate the frequency at which word w j co-occurs with word w i in position p k .",
        "Table 1 illustrates a cooccurrence tensor for the sentence ?dogs bite mailmen?",
        "using a context window of 1 (P = {?1,+1}), in the form of a nested table.",
        "In tensor X, x i:k denotes the row vector of w i at position p k , x :jk denotes the column vector of word w j at position p k and x ij: denotes the tube vector indicating the frequency at which w j co-occurs with w i in each of the positions in P .",
        "HAL-style cooccurrence matrices corresponding to different context windows can be extracted from the tensor by summing and concatenating various slices of the tensor.",
        "A frontal slice X ::k represents a I ?",
        "J cooccurrence matrix for position p k .",
        "A cooccurrence matrix corresponding to a symetric context window of size n can be extracted by summing the slices X ::k for p k ?",
        "{?n,?n + 1, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", n}.",
        "For a directional window, we first sum the slices for p k ?",
        "{?n, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ",?1}, then sum the slices for p k ?",
        "{1, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", n}, then concatenate the 2 resulting matrices horizontally.",
        "Thus, summing and concatenating slices allows us to extract HAL-style cooccurrence matrices.",
        "A different kind of model can also be obtained by concatenating slices of the tensor.",
        "For instance, if we concatenate X ::k for p k ?",
        "{?2,?1,+1,+2} horizontally, we obtain a matrix containing a vec-1 We assume that the target and context words are the same set, but this need not be the case.",
        "58 j=1:dog j=2:bite j=3:mailman k=1:?1 k=2:+1 k=1:?1 k=2:+1 k=1:?1 k=2:+1 i=1:dog 0 0 0 1 0 0 i=2:bite 1 0 0 0 0 1 i=3:mailman 0 0 1 0 0 0 Table 1: A 3?",

        "2 cooccurrence tensor.",
        "tor of length 4J (instead of the 2J-length vectors of the HAL model) for each target word, which encodes cooccurrence information about 4 specific positions relative to that word.",
        "We will refer to this method as the tensor slicing method.",
        "Note that if P = {?1, 1} the resulting matrix is identical to a HAL model with context size 1 As the size of the resulting vectors is KJ , this method can result in very high-dimensional word vectors.",
        "In the original HAL model, Lund et al. (1995) reduced the dimensionality of the vectors through feature selection, by keeping only the features that have the highest variance.",
        "Sch?utze (1992), on the other hand, used truncated SVD for this purpose.",
        "Both techniques can be used with the tensor slicing method.",
        "In our experiment, SVD was applied to the matrices obtained by concatenating tensor slices horizontally 2 .",
        "As for feature selection, a fixed number of features (those with the highest variance) were selected from each slice of the tensor, and these reduced slices were then concatenated.",
        "It must be acknowledged that this tensor encoding method is not efficient in terms of memory.",
        "However, this was not a major issue in our experimental setting, as the size of the vocabulary was small (5K words), and we limited the number of positions in P to 10.",
        "Also, a sparse tensor was used to reduce memory consumption.",
        "5 Experiment 5.1 Corpus and Preprocessing In this experiment, we used the PANACEA Environment English monolingual corpus, which is 2 We also tried concatenating slices vertically (thus obtaining a matrix where rows correspond to <target word, position> tuples and columns correspond to context words) before applying SVD, then concatenating all row vectors corresponding to the same target word, but we will not report the results here for lack of space.",
        "Concatenating slices horizontally performed better and seems more intuitive, and the size of the resulting vectors is not dependent on the number of positions in P .",
        "freely distributed by ELDA for research purposes 3 (Catalog Reference ELRA-W0063).",
        "This corpus contains 28071 documents (?50 million tokens) dealing with different aspects of the environment domain, harvested from web sites using a focused crawler.",
        "The corpus was converted from XML to raw text, various string normalization operations were then applied, and the corpus was lemmatized using TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994).",
        "The vocabulary (W ) was selected based on word frequency: we used the 5000 most frequent words in the cor-pus, excluding stop words and strings containing non-alphabetic characters.",
        "During computation of the cooccurrence tensor, OOV words were ignored (rather than deleted), and the context window was allowed to span sentence boundaries.",
        "5.2 Evaluation Data Models were evaluated using reference data extracted from DiCoEnviro 4 , a specialized dictionary of the environment.",
        "This dictionary describes the meaning and behaviour of terms of the environment domain as well as the lexico-semantic relations between these terms.",
        "Of the various relations encoded in the dictionary, we focused on a subset of three paradigmatic rela-tions: near-synonyms (terms that have similar meanings), antonyms (opposite meanings), and hyponyms (kinds of).",
        "446 pairs containing a headword and a related term were extracted from the dictionary.",
        "We then filtered out the pairs that contained at least one OOV term, and were left with 374 pairs containing two paradigmatically-related, single-word terms.",
        "About two thirds (246) of these examples were used for parameter selection, and the rest were set aside for a final comparison of the highest-scoring models.",
        "3 http://catalog.elra.info/product_ info.php?products_id=1184 4 http://olst.ling.umontreal.ca/ cgi-bin/dicoenviro/search_enviro.cgi (under construction).",
        "59 5.3 Automatic Evaluation Each model was automatically evaluated on the reference data as follows.",
        "For each <headword, related term> pair in the training set, we computed the cosine similarity between the headword and all other words in the vocabulary, then observed the rank of the related term in the sorted list of neighbours.",
        "The score used to compare models is recall at k (R@k), which is the percentage of cases where the related term is among the k nearest neighbours of the headword.",
        "It should be noted that a score of 100% is not always possible in this setting (depending on the value of k), as some headwords have more than 1 related term in the reference data.",
        "Nonetheless, since most (?70%) have 1 or 2 related terms, R@k for some small value of k (we use k = 10) should be a good indicator of accuracy.",
        "A measure that explicitly accounts for the fact that different terms have different numbers of related terms (e.g. R-precision) would be a good alternative.",
        "5.4 Models Tested We compared HAL and the tensor slicing method using either feature selection or SVD 5 , as explained in section 4.",
        "We will refer to each of these models as HAL SEL , TNSR SEL , HAL SVD and TNSR SVD .",
        "Context sizes ranged from 1 to 5 words.",
        "For feature selection, the number of features could take values in {1000, 2000, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", 10000}, 10000 being the maximum number of features in a HAL model using a vocabulary of 5000 words.",
        "In the case of TNSR SEL , to determine the number of features selected per slice, we took each value in {1000, 2000, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", 10000}, divided it by K (the number of positions in P ), and rounded down.",
        "This way, once the slices are concatenated, the total number of features is equal to (or slightly less than) that of one of the HAL SEL mod-els, allowing for a straightforward comparison.",
        "When SVD was used instead of feature selection, the number of components could take values in {100, 200, ..., 1000}.",
        "In all cases, word vectors were weighted using PPMI and normalized 6 .",
        "5 We used the SVD implementation (ARPACK solver) provided in the scikit-learn toolkit (Pedregosa et al., 2011).",
        "6 For HAL SEL and TNSR SEL , we apply PPMI weighting after feature selection.",
        "In the case of TNSR SEL , we wanted to avoid weighting each slice of the tensor separately.",
        "We decided to apply weighting after feature selection in the case of HAL SEL as well in order to enable a more straightforward comparison.",
        "We should also note that, in our experiments absorb extreme precipitation emit severe rainfall sequester intense snowfall convert harsh temperature produce catastrophic rain accumulate unusual evaporation store seasonal runoff radiate mild moisture consume cold snow remove dramatic weather reflect increase deposition Table 2: 10 nearest neighbours of 3 environmental terms using the HAL SEL model.",
        "6 Results Table 2 illustrates the kinds of relations identified by the basic HAL SEL model.",
        "It shows the 10 nearest neighbours of the verb absorb, the adjective extreme and the noun precipitation.",
        "If we compare these results with the paradigmatic relations encoded in DiCoEnviro, we see that, in the case of absorb, 3 of its neighbours are encoded in the dictionary, and all 3 are antonyms or terms having opposite meanings: emit, radiate, and reflect.",
        "As for extreme, the top 2 neighbours are both encoded in the dictionary as near-synonyms.",
        "Finally, rain and snow are both encoded as kinds of precipitation.",
        "Most of the other neighbours shown here are also paradigmatically related to the query terms.",
        "Thus, HAL seems quite capable of identifying the three types of paradigmatic relations we hoped to identify.",
        "Table 3 shows the best R@10 achieved by each model on the training set, which was used to tune the context size and number of features or compo-nents, and their scores on the test set, which was only used to compare the best models.",
        "In the case of HAL SEL , the best model has a context window size of 1 and uses 9K out of 10K available features.",
        "As for TNSR SEL , the best model had a context size of 2 (P = {?2,?1,+1,+2}) and 10000 features (2500 per slice).",
        "It performed only slightly better on the training set, however it beat the HAL model with a wider margin on the test set.",
        "using HAL, PPMI weighting performed better when applied after feature selection, especially for low numbers of features.",

        "R@10 is plotted against number of components.",
        "Models are identical when context size is 1.",
        "(a) HAL SVD (b) TNSR SVD Model Train Test HAL SEL 60.57 57.03 TNSR SEL 60.98 60.94 HAL SVD 59.76 56.25 TNSR SVD 60.57 60.16 Table 3: R@10 (%) of best models.",
        "The best HAL SVD model used a 1-word window and 1000 components, whereas the best TNSR SVD model had a context size of 2 and 800 components.",
        "Again, the tensor-based model slightly edged out the HAL model on the training set, but performed considerably better on the test set.",
        "Further analysis of the results indeed suggests that the tensor slicing method is more robust in some respects than the basic HAL model.",
        "Figure 1 compares the performance of HAL SVD and TNSR SVD on the training set, taking into account context size and number of components.",
        "It shows that the HAL model is quite sensitive to context size, narrower context performing better in this task.",
        "The tensor-based method reduces this gap in performance between context sizes, the gain being greater for larger context sizes.",
        "Furthermore, using the tensor-based method with a slightly wider context (2) raises R@10 for most values of the number of components.",
        "Results obtained with HAL SEL and TNSR SEL follow the same trend, the tensor-based method being more robust with respect to context size.",
        "For lack of space, we only show the plot comparing HAL SVD and TNSR SVD .",
        "7 Concluding Remarks The work presented in this paper is still in its exploratory phase.",
        "The tensor slicing method we described has only been evaluated on one corpus and one set of reference data.",
        "Experiments would need to be carried out on common word space evaluation tasks in order to compare its performance to that of HAL and other word space models.",
        "However, our results suggest that the tensor-based methods are more robust than the basic HAL model to a certain extent, and can improve accuracy.",
        "This could prove especially useful in settings where no reference data are available for parameter tuning.",
        "Various possibilities offered by the cooccurrence tensor remain to be explored, such as weighting the number of features selected per slice using some function of the distance between words, extracting matrices from the tensor by applying various functions to the tube vectors corresponding to each word pair, and applying weighting functions that have been generalized to higher-order tensors (Van de Cruys, 2011) or tensor decomposition methods such as those described in (Turney, 2007).",
