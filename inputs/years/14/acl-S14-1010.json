        "In the present age of digital revolution with proliferating numbers of internet-connected devices, we are facing an exponential rise in the volume of available information.",
        "Users are constantly facing the problem of deciding what to read and what to skip.",
        "Text summarization provides a practical solution to this problem, causing a resurgence in research in this field.",
        "Given a topic of interest, a standard search often yields a large number of documents.",
        "Many of them are not of the user's interest.",
        "Rather than going through the entire result-set, the reader may read a gist of a document, produced via summarization tools, and then decide whether to fully read the document or not, thus saving a substantial amount of time.",
        "According to Jones (2007), a summary can be defined as ?a reductive transformation of source text to summary text through content reduction by selection and/or generalization on what is important in the source?.",
        "Summarization based on content reduction by selection is referred to as extraction (identifying and including the important sentences in the final summary), whereas a summary involving content reduction by generalization is called abstraction (reproduc- ing the most informative content in a new way).",
        "The present paper focuses on extraction-based single-document summarization.",
        "We formulate the task as a graph-based optimization problem, where vertices represent the sentences and edges the connections between sentences.",
        "Textual entailment (Giampiccolo et al., 2007) is employed to estimate the degree of connectivity between sen-tences, and subsequently to assign a weight to each vertex of the graph.",
        "Then, the Weighted Minimum Vertex Cover, a classical graph algorithm, is used to find the minimal set of vertices (that is ?",
        "sentences) that forms a cover.",
        "The idea is that such cover of well-connected vertices would correspond to a cover of the salient content of the document.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we discuss related work and describe the WMVC algorithm.",
        "In Section 3, we propose a novel summarization method, and in Section 4, experiments and results are presented.",
        "Finally, in Section 5, we conclude and outline future research directions.",
        "2 Background Extractive text summarization is the task of identifying those text segments which provide important information about the gist of the document ?",
        "the salient units of the text.",
        "In (Marcu, 2008), salient units are determined as the ones that contain frequently-used words, contain words that are within titles and headings, are located at the beginning or at the end of sections, contain key phrases and are the most highly connected to other parts 75 of the text.",
        "In this work we focus on the last of the above criteria, connectivity, to find highly connected sentences in a document.",
        "Such sentences often contain information that is found in other sentences, and are therefore natural candidates to be included in the summary.",
        "2.1 Related Work The connectivity between sentences has been previously exploited for extraction-based summariza-tion.",
        "Salton et al. (1997) generate intra-document links between passages of a document using automatic hypertext link generation algorithms.",
        "Mani and Bloedorn (1997) use the number of shared words, phrases and co-references to measure connectedness among sentences.",
        "In (Barzilay and El-hadad, 1999), lexical chains are constructed based on words relatedness.",
        "Textual entailment (TE) was exploited recently for text summarization in order to find the highly connected sentences in the document.",
        "Textual entailment is an asymmetric relation between two text fragments specifying whether one fragment can be inferred from the other.",
        "Tatar et al. (2008) have proposed a method called Logic Text Tiling (LTT), which uses TE for sentence scoring that is equal to the number of entailed sentences and to form text segments comprising of highly connected sentences.",
        "Another method called Ana-log Textual Entailment and Spectral Clustering (ATESC), suggested in (Gupta et al., 2012), also uses TE for sentence scoring, using analog scores.",
        "We use a graph-based algorithm to produce the summary.",
        "Graph-based ranking algorithms have been employed for text summarization in the past, with similar representation to ours.",
        "Vertices represent text units (words, phrases or sentences) and an edge between two vertices represent any kind of relationship between two text units.",
        "Scores are assigned to the vertices using some relevant criteria to select the vertices with the highest scores.",
        "In (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), content overlap between sentences is used to add edges between two vertices and Page Rank (Page et al., 1999) is used for scoring the vertices.",
        "Erkan and Radev (2004) use inter-sentence cosine similarity based on word overlap and tf-idf weighting to identify relations between sentences.",
        "In our paper, we use TE to compute connectivity between nodes of the graph and apply the weighted minimum vertex cover (WMVC) algorithm on the graph to select the sentences for the summary.",
        "2.2 Weighted MVC WMVC is a combinatorial optimization problem listed within the classical NP-complete problems (Garey and Johnson, 1979; Cormen et al., 2001).",
        "Over the years, it has caught the attention of many researchers, due to its NP-completeness, and also because its formulation complies with many real world problems.",
