        "In this paper, we describe a computational model for motion events in natural language that maps from linguistic expres-sions, through a dynamic event interpreta-tion, into three-dimensional temporal simulations in a model.",
        "Starting with the model from (Pustejovsky and Moszkow-icz, 2011), we analyze motion events using temporally-traced Labelled Transition Systems.",
        "We model the distinction between path- and manner-motion in an operational semantics, and further distinguish different types of manner-of-motion verbs in terms of the mereo-topological relations that hold throughout the process of movement.",
        "From these representations, we generate minimal models, which are realized as three-dimensional simulations in software developed with the game en-gine, Unity.",
        "The generated simulations act as a conceptual ?debugger?",
        "for the semantics of different motion verbs: that is, by testing for consistency and informativeness in the model, simulations expose the presuppositions associated with linguistic expressions and their compositions.",
        "Because the model generation component is still incomplete, this paper focuses on an implementation which maps directly from linguistic interpretations into the Unity code snippets that create the simulations."

        "Semantic interpretation requires access to both knowledge about words and how they compose.",
        "As the linguistic phenomena associated with lexical semantics have become better understood, several assumptions have emerged across most models of word meaning.",
        "These include the following: (1) a. Lexical meaning involves some sort of ?componential analysis?, either through predicative primitives or a system of types.",
        "b. The selectional properties of predicators can be explained in terms of these com-ponents; c. An understanding of event semantics and the different role of event participants seems crucial for modeling linguistic utterances.",
        "As a starting point in lexical semantic analysis, a standard methodology in both theoretical and computational linguistics is to identify features in a corpus that differentiate the data in meaningful ways; meaningful in terms of prior theoretical assumptions or in terms of observably differentiated behaviors.",
        "Combining these strategies we might, for instance, take a theoretical constraint that we hope to justify through behavioral distinctions in the data.",
        "An example of this is the theoretical claim that motion verbs can be meaningfully divided into two classes: manner- and path-oriented predicates (Talmy, 1985; Jackendoff, 1983; Talmy, 2000).",
        "These constructions can be viewed as encoding two aspects of meaning: how the movement is happening and where it is happening.",
        "The former strategy is illustrated in (2a) and the latter in (2b) (where m indicates a manner verb, and p indicates a path verb).",
        "(2) a.",
        "The ball rolled m .",
        "b. The ball crossed p the room.",
        "With both of the verb types, adjunction can make reference to the missing aspect of motion, by introducing a path (as in (3a)) or the manner of movement (in (3b)).",
        "(3) a.",
        "The ball rolled m across the room.",
        "b. The ball crossed p the room rolling.",
        "Differences in syntactic distribution and grammatical behavior in large datasets, in fact, correlate 99 fairly closely with the theoretical claims made by linguists using small introspective datasets.",
        "The path-manner classification is a case where there are data-derived distinctions that correlate nicely with theoretically inspired predictions.",
        "More often than not, however, lexical semantic distinctions are formal stipulations in a linguistic model, that often have no observable correlations to data.",
        "For example, an examination of the manner of movement class from Levin (1993) illustrates this point.",
        "The verbs below are all Levin-class manner of motion verbs: (4) MANNER OF MOTION VERBS: drive, walk, run, crawl, fly, swim, drag, slide, hop, roll Assuming the two-way distinction between path and manner predication of motion mentioned above, these verbs do, in fact, tend to pattern according to the latter class in the corpus.",
        "Given that they are all manner of motion verbs, however, any data-derived distinctions that emerge within this class will have to be made in terms of additional syntactic or semantic dimensions.",
        "While it is most likely possible to differentiate, for exam-ple, the verbs slide from roll, or walk from hop in the corpus, given enough data, it is important to realize that conceptual and theoretical modeling is often necessary to reveal the factors that semantically distinguish such linguistic expressions, in the first place.",
        "We argue that this problem can be approached with the use of minimal model generation.",
        "As Blackburn and Bos (2008) point out, theorem proving (essentially type satisfaction of a verb in one class as opposed to another) provides a ?nega- tive handle?",
        "on the problem of determining consistency and informativeness for an utterance, while model building provides a ?positive handle?",
        "on both.",
        "For our concerns, simulation construction provides a positive handle on whether two manner of motion processes are distinguished in the model.",
        "Further, the simulation must specify how they are distinguished, the analogue to informativeness.",
        "In this paper, we argue that traditional lexical modeling can benefit greatly from examining how semantic interpretations are contextually and conceptually grounded.",
        "We explore a dynamic interpretation of the lexical semantic model developed in Generative Lexicon Theory (Pustejovsky, 1995; Pustejovsky et al., 2014).",
        "Specifically, we are interested in using model building (Blackburn and Bos, 2008; Konrad, 2004; Gardent and Kon-rad, 2000) and simulation generation (Coyne and Sproat, 2001; Siskind, 2011) to reveal the conceptual presuppositions inherent in natural language expressions.",
        "In this paper, we focus our attention on motion verbs, in order to distinguish between manner and path motion verbs, as well as to model mereotopological distinctions within the manner class.",
        "2 Situating Motion in Space and Time The interpretation of motion in language has been one of the most researched areas in linguistics and Artificial Intelligence (Kuipers, 2000; Freksa, 1992; Galton, 2000; Levinson, 2003; Mani and Pustejovsky, 2012).",
        "Because of their grammatical and semantic import, linguistic interest in identifying where events happen has focused largely on motion verbs and the role played by paths.",
        "Jackendoff (1983), for example, elaborates a semantics for motion verbs incorporating explicit reference to the path traversed by the mover, from source to destination (goal) locations.",
        "Talmy (1983) develops a similar conceptual template, where the path followed by the figure is integral to the conceptualization of the motion against a ground.",
        "Hence, the path can be identified as the central element in defining the location of the event (Talmy, 2000).",
        "Related to this idea, both Zwarts (2005) and Pustejovsky and Moszkowicz (2011) develop mechanisms for dynamically creating the path traversed by a mover in a manner of motion predicate, such as run or drive.",
        "Starting with this approach, the localization of a motion event, therefore, is at least minimally associated with the path created by virtue of the activity.",
        "In addition to capturing the spatial trace of the object in motion, several researchers have pointed out that identifying the shape of the path during motion is also critical for fully interpreting the semantics of movement.",
        "Eschenbach et al. (1999) discusses the orientation associated with the trajectory, something they refer to as oriented curves.",
        "Motivated more by linguistic considera-tions, Zwarts (2006) introduces the notion of an event shape, which is the trajectory associated with an event in space represented by a path.",
        "He defines a shape function, which is a partial function assigning unique paths to those events involving motion or extension in physical space.",
        "This work suggests that the localization of an event 100 makes reference to orientational as well as config-urational factors, a view that is pursued in Pustejovsky (2013b).",
        "This forces us to look at the various spatio-temporal regions associated with the event participants, and the interactions between them.",
        "These issues are relevant to our present con-cerns, because in order to construct a simulation, a motion event must be embedded within an appropriate minimal embedding space.",
        "This must sufficiently enclose the event localization, while optionally including room enough for a frame of reference visualization of the event (the viewer's per-spective).",
        "We return to this issue later in the paper when constructing our simulation from the semantic interpretation associated with motion events.",
        "3 Modeling Motion in Language 3.1 Theoretical Assumptions The advantage of adopting a dynamic interpretation of motion is that we can directly distinguish path predication from manner of motion predication in an operational semantics (Miller and Charles, 1991; Miller and Johnson-Laird, 1976) that maps nicely to a simulation environment.",
        "Models of processes using updating typically make reference to the notion of a state transition (van Benthem, 1991; Harel, 1984).",
        "This is done by distinguishing between formulae, ?, and programs, pi.",
        "A formula is interpreted as a classical propositional expression, with assignment of a truth value in a specific model.",
        "We will interpret specific models by reference to specific states.",
        "A state is a set of propositions with assignments to variables at a specific index.",
        "Atomic programs are input/output relations ( [[pi]] ?",
        "S ?",
        "S), and compound programs are constructed from atomic ones following rules of dynamic logic (Harel et al., 2000).",
        "For the present discussion, we represent the dynamics of actions in terms of Labeled Transition Systems (LTSs) (van Benthem, 1991).",
        "1 An LTS consists of a triple, ?S,Act,?",
        "?, where: S is the set of states; Act is a set of actions; and?",
        "is a total transition relation:??",
        "S?Act?S.",
        "An action, ?",
        "?",
        "Act, provides the labeling on an arrow, making it explicit what brings about a state-to-state 1 This is consistent with the approach developed in (Fer- nando, 2009; Fernando, 2013).",

        "While suggestive, these distinctions are only partially useful towards actually teasing apart the semantic dimensions along which we identify the contributing factors of manner.",
        "Mani and Pustejovsky (2012) suggest a different strategy involving the identification of semantic parameters that clearly differentiate verb senses from each other within this class.",
        "One parameter exploited quite extensively within the motion class involves the mereotopological contraints that inhere throughout the movement of the object (Ran- dell et al., 1992; Asher and Vieu, 1995; Gal-ton, 2000).",
        "Using this parameter, we are able to distinguish several of Levin's classes of manner 3 Cf. (Pustejovsky, 2013a) and (Krifka, 1992).",
        "as well as some novel ones, as described in (9), where a class is defined by the constraints that hold throughout the event (where EC is ?externally con-nected?, and DC is ?disconnected?).",

        "When the latter are employed in induced (directed) motion constructions (Levin, 1993; Jackendoff, 1996), they take on the meaning of manner of motion verbs.",
        "Distinguishing between a sliding and hopping motion involves inspecting the next-state content in the motion n-gram: namely, there is a continuous satisfaction of EC(F,G) throughout the motion for slide and a toggling effect (on-off) for the predicates bounce and hop, as shown in (10).",

        "The idea of constructing simulations from linguistic utterances is, of course, not new.",
        "There are two groups of researchers who have developed related ideas quite extensively: simulation theo-rists, working in the philosophy of mind, such as Alvin Goldman and Robert Gordon; and cognitive scientists and linguists, such as Jerry Feldman, Ron Langacker, and Ben Bergen.",
        "According to Goldman (1989), simulation provides a process-driven theory of mind and mental attribution, differing from the theory-driven models proposed by Churchland and others (Churchland, 1991).",
        "From the cognitive linguistics tradition, simulation semantics has come to denote the mental instantiation of an interpretation of any linguistic utterance (Feldman, 2006; Bergen et al., 2007; Bergen, 2012).",
        "While these communities do not seem to reference each other, it is clear from our perspec-tive, that they are both pursuing similar programs, where distinct linguistic utterances correspond to generated models that have differentiated structures and behaviors (Narayanan, 1999; Siskind, 2011; Goldman, 2006).",

        "If there exists a behavior corresponding to the predicate (by name) on an entity bearing the name of the predicate's first (subject) argument, the transformation encoded in that behavior is performed over the entity until an end condition specific to the behavior is met.",

        "In figure 5, the bounds of Floor completely surround the bounds of Ball2 (IN(Ball2,Floor) in RCC8).",
        "This configuration makes it possible for the simulation to compute a motion moving the Ball2 object from one side of the Floor to the other.",

        "Our strategy has been to use minimal simulation generation as a conceptual Figure 5: Roll and slide motions in progress (top), and cross motion in progress (bottom).",
        "debugging tool, in order to tease out the semantic differences between linguistic expressions; specifically those between verbs that are members of conventionally homogeneous classes, according to linguistic analysis.",
        "It should be pointed out that our goal is different from WordsEye (Coyne and Sproat, 2001).",
        "While we are interested in using simulation generation to differentiate semantic distinctions in both lexical classes and compositional constructions, the goal behind WordsEye is to provide an enhanced interface to allow non-specialists create 3D scenes without being familiar with special software models for everyday objects and relations.",
        "There are obvious synergies between these two goals that can be pursued.",
        "The simulations we create provide an interpretation of the given motion predicate over the given entity, but not the only interpretation.",
        "Just as Coyne et al. (2010) does for static objects in the WordsEye system, we must apply some implicit constraints to our motion predicates to allow them to be visually simulated.",
        "For instance, in the roll and slide examples given in Figure 5, both objects are moving in the same direction?parallel to the back wall of the room object.",
        "Had the objects been moving perpendicular to the back wall or in any other direction, as long as they remained in con-106 tact with the floor at all times, the simulated motion would still be considered a ?roll?",
        "(if rotating around an axis parallel to the floor), or a ?slide?",
        "(if not), regardless of what the precise direction of motion is.",
        "Minimal pairs in a model have to be compared and contrasted in a discriminative way, and thus in modeling a slide predicate versus a roll predicate, knowing that the distinction is one of rotation parallel to the surface is enough to distinguish the two predicates in a model.",
        "In a simulation, the discriminative process requires that the two contrasting behaviors look dif-ferent, and as such, the simulation software must be able to completely render a scene for each frame from behavior start to behavior finish, and so every variable for every object being rendered must have an assigned value, including the position of the object from frame to frame.",
        "If these values are left unspecified, the software either fails to compile or throws an exception.",
        "Thus, we are forced to arbitrarily choose a direction of motion (as well as direction of rotation, speed of rota-tion, speed of motion, etc.).",
        "As long as all non-changing variables are kept consistent between a minimal pair of behaviors, we can evaluate the quantitative and qualitative differences between the values that do change.",
        "As simulations require values to be assigned to variables that can be left unspecified in an ordinary modeling process, simulations expose presuppositions about the semantics of motion verbs and of compositions that would not be necessary in a model alone.",
        "In order to evaluate the appropriateness of a given simulation, we are currently experimenting with a strategy often used in classification and annotation tasks, namely pairwise similarity judg-ments (Rumshisky et al., 2012; Pustejovsky and Rumshisky, 2014).",
        "This involves presenting a user with a simple discrimination task that has a reduced cognitive load, comparing the similarity of the example to the target instances.",
        "In the present context, a subject is shown a specific simulation resulting from the translation from textual input, through DITL, to the visualization.",
        "A set of activity or event descriptions is given, and the subject is then asked to select which best describes the simulation shown; e.g., ?Is this a sliding?",
        "?, ?Is this a rolling??.",
        "The results of this experiment are presently being evaluated.",
        "The system is currently in the prototype stage and needs to be expanded in three main areas: object library, parsing pipeline, and predicate handling.",
        "Our object and behavior libraries are currently limited to geometric primitives and the motions that can be applied over them.",
        "While roll, slide, and cross behaviors can be scripted for spheres and cubes and shapes derived from them, a predicate like walk cannot be supported on the current infrastructure.",
        "Thus, we intend to expand the object library to include more complex inanimate objects (tables, chairs, or other household objects) as well as animate objects.",
        "Having an object library containing forms capable of executing greater numbers of predicates will allow us to implement those predicates.",
        "The parsing pipeline described in Section 4 is only partially implemented, with the only completed parts being the latter stages, relating a formulas to a scripted behavior and its arguments.",
        "We intend to expand the parsing pipeline to include all the steps described in this paper: taking input as a simple natural language sentence, tagging and parsing it to extract the constituent parts of a pred-icate/argument representation, and using that output to prompt a behavior in software as a dynamic event structure.",
        "More robust parsing will afford us the opportunity to expand the diversity of predicates that the software can handle as well (Mc- Donald and Pustejovsky, 2014).",
        "While currently limited to unary and binary predicates, we need to extend the capability to ternary predicates and predicates of greater arity, including the use of adjunct phrases and indirect objects.",
        "We are in the process of developing an implementation that uses Boxer (Curran et al., 2007) so that we can create first-order models from the dynamic expressions used here.",
