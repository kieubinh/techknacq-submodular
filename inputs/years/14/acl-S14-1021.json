        "Sometimes modifiers have a strong effect on core aspects of the meaning of the nouns they are attached to: A parrot is a desirable pet, but a dead parrot is, at the very least, a rather unusual household companion.",
        "In order to stimulate computational research into the impact of modification on phrase meaning, we collected and made available a large dataset containing subject ratings for a variety of noun phrases and the categories they might belong to.",
        "We propose to use compositional distributional semantics to model these data, experimenting with numerous distributional semantic spaces, phrase composition methods and asymmetric similarity measures.",
        "Our models capture a statistically significant portion of the data, although much work is still needed before we achieve a full computational account of modification effects."

        "Not all modifiers are created equal.",
        "Green parrots have all essential qualities of parrots, but dead parrots don't.",
        "For example, as vocally argued by the disgruntled costumer in Monty Python's famous Dead Parrot Sketch, 1 dead parrots make rather poor pet birds.",
        "In modifier-head constructions (that, for the purpose of this article, we restrict to right-headed adjective-noun and noun-noun con-structions), modifiers are not simply picking a subset of the denotation of the head they modify, but they are often distorting the properties of the head in a radical manner.",
        "These modifier effects on phrase meaning have been studied extensively by theoretical linguists, 1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_ Parrot_sketch who have focused primarily on the extreme case of intensional modifiers such as fake, alleged and toy, where the phrase denotes something that is no longer (or is not necessarily) a head (a toy gun is not a gun).",
        "See McNally (2013) for a recent review of the linguistic literature.",
        "Cognitive scientists have looked at modification phenomena within the general study of conceptual combination (see Chapter 12 of Murphy (2002) for an extensive review).",
        "The cognitive tradition has focused on how modification affects prototypicality: a guppy is the prototypical pet fish, but it is neither a typical pet nor a typical fish (Smith and Osher-son, 1984).",
        "This line of research has highlighted how strong modification effects might be the rule, rather than the exception: Wisniewski (1997) reports that, when subjects were asked to provide the meaning for more than 200 novel modifier-head constructions, ?70% [of the answers] involved the construal of a noun's referent as something other than the typical category named by the noun [head].?",
        "Indeed, recent research suggests that even the most stereotypical modifiers affect prototypicality, so that subjects are less willing to attribute to quacking ducks such obvious duck properties as having webbed feet (Connolly et al., 2007).",
        "The impact of modification on phrase meaning is not only very interesting from a linguistic and cognitive perspective, but also important from a practical point of view, as it might affect expected entailment patterns: If parrot entails pet, then lively parrot also entails pet.",
        "However, as we saw above, dead parrot doesn't necessarily entail pet (at least not from the point of view of a disgruntled costumer who was just sold the corpse).",
        "Being able to track the impact that modifiers have on heads should thus have a positive effect on important tasks such as recognizing textual entail-ment, paraphrasing and anaphora resolution (An- droutsopoulos and Malakasiotis, 2010; Dagan et 171 al., 2009; Poesio et al., 2010).",
        "Despite their theoretical and practical import, modification effects have been largely overlooked in computational linguistics, with the notable exception of Boleda et al. (2012; 2013), who only focused on the extreme case of intensional adjec-tives, studied a limited number of modifiers, and did not attempt to capture the graded nature of modification (a dead parrot is not a prototypical animal, but a toy parrot is not an animal at all).",
        "This paper aims to stimulate computational research into modifier effects on phrase meaning in two ways.",
        "First, we introduce a new, large, publicly available data set of modifier-head phrases annotated with four kinds of modification-related subject ratings: whether the concept denoted by the phrase is an instance of the concept denoted by its head (is a dead parrot still a parrot?",
        "), to what extent it is a member of one of the larger categories the head belongs to (is it still a pet?",
        "), and typicality ratings for the same questions (how typical is a dead parrot as a parrot?",
        "and as a pet?).",
        "Second, we present a first attempt to model the collected judgments computationally.",
        "We choose distributional semantics (Erk, 2012) as our frame of reference, as it produces continuous similarity scores, in line with the graded nature of the modification effects we are investigating.",
        "In partic-ular, we look at the compositional extension of distributional semantics (Baroni, 2013), because we need representations not only for words, but also phrases, and we adopt the asymmetric similarity measures developed in the literature on lexical entailment (Kotlerman et al., 2010; Lenci and Benotto, 2012), because we are interested in an asymmetric relation (to what extent the concept denoted by the phrase is a good instance of the target class, and not vice versa).",
        "As far as we know, this is the first time these asymmetric measures are applied to composed representations (Baroni et al. (2012) experimented with entailment measures applied to phrase representations directly harvested from corpora, and not derived composi-tionally).",
        "We are thus also providing a novel evaluation of compositional models and asymmetric measures on a challenging task where they could potentially be very useful.",
        "2 2 Connell and Ramscar (2001) showed good correlation of similarity scores produced by the LSA distributional semantic model with human category typicality judgments, however they did not consider phrases nor adopted an asymmetric measure to take directionality into account.",
        "2 The Norwegian Blue Parrot data set We introduce Norwegian Blue Parrot (NBP), 3 a new, large data set to explore modification effects.",
        "Given a head noun h and a modifier adjective or noun m, NBP contains average membership and typicality ratings for the phrase mh both as an instance of h and as an instance of c (a broader category h belongs to).",
        "As a control, we also present ratings for unmodified h as an instance of c (we will use them below to test similarity measures on their ability to capture the direction of the membership relation, and to zero in on the effect of modification vs. more general member-ship/typicality effects).",
        "We include, and indeed focus on, relations with broader categories because they are more prone to modification effects: In-tuitively, a dead parrot is still a parrot, but it is, at the very least, an atypical pet.",
        "The statistics in Table 1, discussed below, confirm our intuition that subjects are more likely to assign lower scores with respect to a broader category than to the head category itself (although this is, no doubt, in part by construction, since we started constructing the dataset by mining examples where mh is atypical of c, not h).",
        "We collect both membership and typicality ratings because we expect them to have different implications for sound entailment.",
        "If x is not a member of class y, then x obviously does not entail y.",
        "However, if x is an atypical y, entailment still holds, but some typical properties of y might not carry over (e.g., in an anaphora resolution setting, we might still consider co-indexing dead parrot with animal, but not with breathing creature, despite the fact that breathing is a highly characteristic property of animals).",
        "In order to make sure that NBP would contain a fair number of examples affected by strong modification effects, we first came up with a set of ?m,h, c?",
        "tuples where, according to our own in-tuition, m makes h fairly atypical as an instance of c. For example, a bottle is a piece of drinkware.",
        "If we add the modifier perfume, we expect that, while subjects might still agree that a perfume bottle is a bottle, they should generally disagree on the statement that a perfume bottle belongs to the drinkware category.",
        "We refer to tuples of this sort (e.g., ?perfume, bottle, drinkware?)",
        "as distorted tuples in what follows.",
        "4 3 Available from http://clic.cimec.unitn.it/ composes/ 4 When creating the tuples, we also used some adjectives 172 We then constructed a number of tuples that should not display a strong modification effect.",
        "In particular, in order to insure that any atypical rating we obtained on the distorted tuples could not be explained away by characteristics of m or h alone (rather than by their combination), for each distorted tuple we constructed a few more tuples with the same h and c but a different m, that we did not expect to be strongly distorting (e.g., ?plastic, bottle, drinkware?).",
        "Similarly, for each distorted tuple we generated a few more with the same m, but combined with (the same or differ-ent) h and c on which the m should not exert a strong effect (?perfume, bottle, container?).",
        "In total, NBP is based on 489 distorted tuples and 1938 more matching tuples.",
        "We constructed NBP to insure that it would contain many tuples displaying strong modification effects, and highly comparable tuples that do not feature such effects.",
        "An alternative approach would have been to rate phrases that were randomly selected from a corpus.",
        "This would have led to a dataset reflecting a more realistic distribution of modification effects, but it would not have guaranteed, for the same number of pairs, a fair amount of distorted tuples and comparable controls.",
        "We leave the study of the natural distribution of modification strength in text to further work.",
        "To find inspiration for the tuples, we looked into various databases containing concepts organized by category, namely BLESS (Baroni and Lenci, 2011), ConceptNet (Speer and Havasi, 2013) and WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "We insured that all words in our tuples occurred at least 200 times in the large corpus we describe below (phrases were not filtered by frequency, due to data sparseness).",
        "Finally, when looking for tuples matching the distorted ones, we made sure that the mh phrases in the new tuples have similar Pointwise Mutual Information to the corresponding phrases in the distorted tuple (or, where the latter were not attested in the corpus, similar m and h frequencies).",
        "Finding meaningful combinations among unattested or infrequent phrases was not an easy task and there was not always a perfect candidate.",
        "However, the phrases selected in this way yielded challenging items for which there is little or no direct corpus evidence, so that compositional models are required to account for them.",
        "that have been traditionally labeled as intensional by seman-ticists: artificial, toy, former.",
        "From each source tuple (e.g., ?plastic, bottle, drinkware?",
        "), we generated 3 instance-class combinations to be rated: mh ?",
        "c (plastic bottle ?",
        "drinkware), mh ?",
        "h (plastic bottle?",
        "bottle), h?",
        "c (bottle?",
        "drinkware), for a total of 5,849 pairs, that constitute the final NBP data set (2,417 mh ?",
        "c pairs, 2,115 mh ?",
        "h pairs and 1,317 h?",
        "c pairs).",
        "5 For each of these pairs, we collected both membership and typicality ratings through two surveys on the CrowdFlower platform.",
        "6 Subjects came exclusively from English speaking countries and no special qualifications were required from them.",
        "Membership ratings were collected by asking subjects whether the instance is a member of the class (formulated as a yes/no question).",
        "In a separate study, we asked subjects to rate how typical the instance is as member of the class on a 7-point scale.",
        "For both questions, we collected 10 judgments per pair and report their averages in NBP.",
        "For both sur-veys, we added 48 control pairs with an expected answer (yes/no for membership, high/low range for typicality), that the subjects had to provide in order for their ratings to be included in the final set (?gold standard?",
        "items in crowd-sourcing par-lance).",
        "These controls included highly prototypical pairs (dog?",
        "animal), possibly with stereotypical modifiers (beautiful rose?",
        "flower), and unrelated pairs (biology?",
        "dance), also possibly under modification (popular magazine?",
        "animal).",
        "We asked for binary rather than graded membership judgments because these are more in line with commonsense intuitions about category membership (we might naturally speak of sparrows being more typical birds than penguins, but it is strange to say that they are ?more birds?).",
        "The standard view in the psychology of concepts (Hampton, 1991) is that membership judgments are the product of a hard threshold we impose on the typicality scale (x is not y if the typicality of x as y is below a certain, subject-dependent threshold), although under certain experimental conditions subjects can also conceptualize membership as a graded property (Kalish, 1995).",
        "Membership and typicality ratings, especially in borderline cases such as those we constructed, are the output of complex cognitive processes where large inter-subject differences are expected, 5 There is a larger number of mh ?",

        "Membership values range from 0 to 1, typicality values from 1 to 7. so it doesn't make sense to worry about ?inter- annotator agreement?",
        "in this context.",
        "Still, several sanity checks indicate that, overall, our subjects understood our questions as we meant them, and behaved in a reasonably coherent manner.",

        "Moreover, for membership, in 86% of the cases at least 8 over 10 subjects gave the same response.",
        "For typicality, the observed average rating standard deviation across pairs (1.2) is significantly below what expected by chance (p < 0.05), based on a simulated random rating distribution.",
        "Membership and typicality ratings are highly cor-related, but not identical (r = 0.76) Table 1 reports mean membership and typicality scores in NBP.",
        "Both ratings are negatively skewed, that is, subjects had the tendency to respond assertively to the membership question and to give high typicality scores.",
        "This is not surprising: Because of the way NBP was constructed, there are about 4 tuples with no expected strong modification effect for each distorted tuple.",

        "Some examples in Table 2 illustrate an important design choice we made in constructing NBP, namely, to ignore the issue of whether potential modification effects are actually due to the modifier and the category pertaining to different word senses of the head term.",
        "One might argue, for example, that egg has a food sense and a reproductive vessel sense.",
        "The human modifier picks the second sense, and so, obviously, human eggs are judged as bad instances of food.",
        "While we see the point of this objection, we think it's impossible to draw a clear-cut distinction between discrete word senses (even in the rather extreme egg case, the eggs we eat are reproductive vessels from a chicken point of view!).",
        "This has been long recognized in the linguistic and cognitive literature (Kilgarriff, 1997; Murphy, 2002), 174 and even by the computational word sense disambiguation community, that is currently addressing the continuous nature of polysemy by shifting to the lexical-substitution-in-context task (McCarthy and Navigli, 2009).",
        "Context provides fundamental cues to disambiguating polysemous words, and noun modifiers typically act as important disambiguating contexts for the nouns.",
        "Thus, we think that it is more productive for computational systems to handle modifier-triggered disambiguation as a special case of the more general class of modification effects, than to engage in the quixotic pursuit to determine, a priori, what's the boundary between a word-sense and a ?pure?",
        "modification effect.",
        "Note in Table 2 that grilled trout was unanimously rated by subjects as an instance of the creature category, despite the fact that the cooking-related grilled modifier cues a classic shift from an animal (and thus creature) sense to food (Copestake and Briscoe, 1995).",
        "Examples like this suggest that our agnosticism is warranted.",
        "3 Methods 3.1 Composition models We experiment with many ways to derive a phrase vector by combining the vectors of its constituents.",

        "Given vectors ~a and ~ b, the weighted additive model (wadd) returns their weighted sum: ~p = w 1 ~a + w 2 ~ b. In the dilation model (dil), the output vector is obtained by decomposing one of the input vectors, say ~ b, into a vector parallel to ~a and its orthogonal counter-part, and then dilating only the parallel vector by a factor ?",
        "before re-combining.",
        "The corresponding formula is: (~a ?~a) ~ b + (?",
        "?",
        "1)(~a ?",
        "~ b)~a.",
        "In our ex-periments, we stretch the head vector in the direction of the modifier (i.e., ~a is the modifier, ~ b is the head).",
        "In the multiplicative model (mult), vectors are combined by component-wise multiplication, such that each phrase component p i is given by: p i = a i b i .",
        "Guevara (2010) and Zanzotto et al. (2010) propose a full form of the additive model (fulladd), where the two constituent vectors are multiplied by weight matrices before being added, so that each phrase component is a weighted sum of all constituent components: ~p = W 1 ~a+W 2 ~ b. Finally, the lexical function (lexfunc) model of Baroni and Zamparelli (2010) and Coecke et al. (2010) takes inspiration from formal semantics to characterize composition as function application.",
        "In particular, in modifier-head phrases, the modifier is treated as a linear function operating on the head vector.",
        "Given that linear functions can be expressed by matrices and their application by matrix-by-vector multiplication, the modifier is represented by a matrix A to be multiplied with the modifier vector ~ b, so that: ~p = A ~ b. We use the DISSECT toolkit 7 to estimate the parameters of the composition methods and derive phrase vectors.",
        "In particular, DISSECT finds optimal parameter settings by learning to approximate corpus-extracted phrase vector examples with least-squares methods (Dinu et al., 2013).",
        "We use as training examples all the modifier-head phrases that contain a modifier of interest and occur at least 50 times in our source corpus (see Section 3.3 below).",
        "3.2 Asymmetric similarity measures Several measures to identify word pairs that stand in an instance-class relationship by comparing their vectors have been proposed in the recent distributional semantics literature (Kotlerman et al., 2010; Lenci and Benotto, 2012; Weeds et al., 2004).",
        "8 While the task of deciding if u is in class v is typically framed (also by distributional semanti-cists) in binary, yes-or-no terms, all proposed measures return a continuous numerical score.",
        "9 Con-sequently, we conjecture that they might be well-suited to capture the graded notions of class membership and typicality we recorded in NBP.",
        "10 In what follows, we use w x (f) to denote the weight (value) of feature (dimension) f in the distributional vector of term x. F x denotes the set of features (dimensions) in the vector of x such that w x (f) > t, where t is a predefined threshold to decide whether a feature is active.",
        "11 Importantly, 7 http://clic.cimec.unitn.it/composes/ toolkit/ 8 We speak of ?instance-class relations?",
        "in a very broad and loose sense, to encompass classic relations such as hy-ponymy but also the fuzzier notion of lexical entailment.",

        "In the interaction between compositional models and directional similarity measures, we have observed that simpler models yield better results.",
        "Specifically, mult and wadd are economical composition models than can be applied on full-rank spaces, which in turn work best with our similarity measures.",
        "Psychologists studying modification effects in concept combination have proposed models that are usually quite complex, relying on hand-crafted feature definitions and making very strong assumptions about the combination process (see for example Cohen and Murphy (1984), Smith et al. (1988)).",
        "Some of these assumptions have led other researchers to argue that prototypes do not compose at all (Connolly et al., 2007).",
        "In contrast, the approach we borrow from distributional se-mantics, while only mildly successful for now, has the advantage of being very simple both in its construction and application, and in the assumptions that it makes.",
        "Also notable is that we are putting under the same umbrella tasks that have been traditionally tackled separately.",
        "For example, among the effects present in the dataset, we can find both word sense disambiguation (see discussion at the end of Section 2) and what Murphy (2002) calls ?knowl- edge effects?",
        "(e.g., a plane makes a very good ma-chine, but a paper plane doesn't).",
        "Moreover, these effects can also interact (people know that a human egg is actually a single, small cell, and hence not even cannibals would consider it satisfactory food).",
        "We can thus explore the empirical question of whether all these related phenomena can be tackled together, with a single model accounting for all of them.",
        "In conclusion, the challenge that we introduced brings together concept combination and non-subsective modification phenomena studied in psychology and theoretical linguistics, and tries to handle them with the standard machinery of computational linguistics.",
        "This challenge has proved quite difficult for current tools, but this is exactly what we expected in the first place.",
        "Our goal, from the outset, was to create a task that could help us delimiting the boundaries of computational methods for characterizing human con-cepts, while delimiting, at the same time, the notion of human concepts itself.",
