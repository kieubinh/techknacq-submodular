        "This paper introduces a new SemEval task on Cross-Level Semantic Similarity (CLSS), which measures the degree to which the meaning of a larger linguistic item, such as a paragraph, is captured by a smaller item, such as a sentence.",

        "Nineteen teams submitted 38 systems.",
        "Most systems surpassed the baseline performance, with several attaining high performance for multiple comparison types.",
        "Further, our results show that comparisons of semantic representation increase performance beyond what is possible with text alone."

        "Given two linguistic items, semantic similarity measures the degree to which the two items have the same meaning.",
        "Semantic similarity is an essential component of many applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and similarity measurements between all types of text as well as between word senses lend themselves to a variety of NLP tasks such as information retrieval (Hliaoutakis et al., 2006) or paraphrasing (Glick- man and Dagan, 2003).",
        "Semantic similarity evaluations have largely focused on comparing similar types of lexical items.",
        "Most recently, tasks in SemEval (Agirre et al., 2012) and *SEM (Agirre et al., 2013) have introduced benchmarks for measuring Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) between similar-sized sentences and phrases.",
        "Other data sets such as that This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "License details: http: //creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ of Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965) measure similarity between word pairs, while the data sets of Navigli (2006) and Kilgarriff (2001) offer a binary similar-dissimilar distinction between senses.",
        "Notably, all of these evaluations have focused on comparisons between a single type, in contrast to application-based evaluations such as summarization and compositionality which incorporate textual items of different sizes, e.g., measuring the quality of a paragraph's sentence summarization.",
        "Task 3 introduces a new evaluation where similarity is measured between items of different types: paragraphs, sentences, phrases, words and senses.",
        "Given an item of the lexically-larger type, a system measures the degree to which the meaning of the larger item is captured in the smaller type, e.g., comparing a paragraph to a sentence.",
        "We refer to this task as Cross-Level Semantic Similarity (CLSS).",
        "A major motivation of this task is to produce semantic similarity systems that are able to compare all types of text, thereby freeing downstream NLP applications from needing to consider the type of text being compared.",
        "Task 3 enables assessing the extent to which the meaning of the sentence ?do u know where i can watch free older movies online without download??",
        "is captured in the phrase ?streaming vintage movies for free?, or how similar is ?circumscribe?",
        "to the phrase ?beating around the bush.?",
        "Furthermore, by incorporating comparisons of a variety of item sizes, Task 3 unifies in a single task multiple objectives from different areas of NLP such as para-phrasing, summarization, and compositionality.",
        "Because CLSS generalizes STS to items of different types, successful CLSS systems can directly be applied to all STS-based applications.",
        "Fur-thermore, CLSS systems can be used in other similarity-based applications such as text simplification (Specia et al., 2012), keyphrase identification (Kim et al., 2010), lexical substitution (McCarthy and Navigli, 2009), summariza-17 tion (Sp?arck Jones, 2007), gloss-to-sense mapping (Pilehvar and Navigli, 2014b), and modeling the semantics of multi-word expressions (Marelli et al., 2014) or polysemous words (Pilehvar and Nav-igli, 2014a).",
        "Task 3 was designed with three main objectives.",
        "First, the task should include multiple types of comparison in order to assess each type's difficulty and whether specialized resources are needed for each.",
        "Second, the task should incorporate text from multiple domains and writing styles to ensure that system performance is robust across text types.",
        "Third, the similarity methods should be able to operate at the sense level, thereby potentially uniting text- and sense-based similarity methods within a single framework.",
        "2 Task Description 2.1 Objective Task 3 is intended to serve as an initial task for evaluating the capabilities of systems at measuring all types of semantic similarity, independently of the size of the text.",
        "To accomplish this objective, systems were presented with items from four comparison types: (1) paragraph to sentence, (2) sentence to phrase, (3) phrase to word, and (4) word to sense.",
        "Given a pair of items, a system must assess the degree to which the meaning of the larger item is captured in the smaller item.",
        "WordNet 3.0 was chosen as the sense inventory (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "2.2 Rating Scale Following previous SemEval tasks (Agirre et al., 2012; Jurgens et al., 2012), Task 3 recognizes that two items?",
        "similarity may fall within a range of similarity values, rather than having a binary notion of similar or dissimilar.",
        "Initially a six-point (0?5) scale similar to that used in the STS tasks was considered (Agirre et al., 2012); however, annotators found difficulty in deciding between the lower-similarity options.",
        "After multiple revisions and feedback from a group of initial annotators, we developed a five-point Likert scale for rating a pair's similarity, shown in Table 1.",
        "1 The scale was designed to systematically order a broad range of semantic relations: synonymy, similarity, relatedness, topical association, and un-relatedness.",
        "Because items are of different sizes, the highest rating is defined as very similar rather 1 Annotation materials along with all training and test data are available on the task website http://alt.qcri.",
        "org/semeval2014/task3/.",
        "than identical to allow for some small loss in the overall meaning.",
        "Furthermore, although the scale is designed as a Likert scale, annotators were given flexibility when rating items to use values between the defined points in the scale, indicating a blend of two relations.",
        "Table 2 provides examples of pairs for each scale rating for all four comparison type.",
        "3 Task Data Though several data sets exist for STS and comparing words and senses, no standard data set exists for CLSS.",
        "Therefore, we created a pilot data set designed to test the capabilities of systems in a variety of settings.",
        "The task data for all comparisons but word-to-sense was created using a three-phase process.",
        "First, items of all sizes were selected from publicly-available data sets.",
        "Second, the selected items were used to produce a second item of the next-smaller level (e.g., a sentence inspires a phrase).",
        "Third, the pairs of items were annotated for their similarity.",
        "Because of the expertise required for working with word senses, the word-to-sense data set was constructed by the organizers using a separate but similar process.",
        "In the training and test data, each comparison type had 500 annotated examples, for a total of 2000 pairs each for training and test.",
        "We first describe the corpora used by Task 3 followed by the annotation process.",
        "We then describe the construction of the word-to-sense data set.",
        "3.1 Corpora Test and training data were constructed by drawing from multiple publicly-available corpora and then manually generating a paired item for comparison.",
        "To achieve our second objective for the task, the data sets used to create item pairs included texts from specific domains, social media, and text with idiomatic or slang language.",
        "Table 3 summarizes the corpora and their distribution across the test and training sets for each comparison type, with a high-level description of the genre of the data.",
        "We briefly describe the corpora next.",

        "In addition, we included a new type of challenge genre with Fa-bles; unlike other domains, the sentences paired with the fable paragraphs were potentially semantic interpretations of the intent of the fable, i.e., the moral of the story.",
        "These interpretations often have little textual overlap with the fable itself and require a deeper interpretation of the paragraph's meaning in order to make the correct similarity judgment.",

        "Therefore, we strongly encouraged participating teams to submit systems that were capable of generating similarity judgments for multiple comparison types.",
        "However, to further the analysis, participants were also permitted to submit systems specialized to a single domain.",
        "Teams were allowed at most three system submissions, regardless of the number of comparison types supported.",
        "Scoring Systems were required to provide similarity values for all items within a comparison type.",
        "Following prior STS evaluations, systems were scored for each comparison type using Pearson correlation.",
        "Additionally, we include a second score using Spearman's rank correlation, which is only affected by differences in the ranking of items by similarity, rather than differences in the similarity values.",
        "Pearson correlation was chosen as the official evaluation metric since the goal of the task is to produce similar scores.",
        "However, Spearman's rank correlation provides an important metric for assessing systems whose scores do not match human scores but whose rankings might, e.g., string-similarity measures.",
        "Ultimately, a global ranking was produced by ordering systems by the sum of their Pearson correlation values for each of the four comparison levels.",
        "Baselines The official baseline system was based on the Longest Common Substring (LCS), normalized by the length of items using the method of Clough and Stevenson (2011).",
        "Given a pair, the similarity is reported as the normalized length of the LCS.",
        "In the case of word-to-sense, the LCS for a word-sense pair is measured between the sense's definition in WordNet and the definitions of each sense of the pair's word, reporting the maximal LCS.",
        "Because OOV and slang words are not in WordNet, the baseline reports the average similarity value of non-OOV items.",
        "Baseline scores were made public after the evaluation period ended.",
        "Because LCS is a simple procedure, a second baseline based on Greedy String Tiling (GST) (Wise, 1996) was added after the evaluation period concluded.",
        "Unlike LCS, GST better handles the transpositions of tokens across the two texts and can still report high similarity when encountering reordered text.",
        "The minimum match length for GST was set to 6.",

        "content becomes smaller, e.g., a word or phrase, the textual similarity does not necessarily provide a meaningful indication of the semantic similarity between the two.",
        "This performance discrepancy suggests that, in order to perform well, CLSS systems must rely on comparisons between semantic representations rather than textual representations.",
        "The two top-performing systems on these smaller levels, Meerkat Mafia and SimCompass, used additional resources beyond WordNet to expand a word or sense to its definition or to represent words with distributional representations.",

        "An interesting observation is that a system's official rank does not always match the rank from aggregating its correlations for each genre individually.",
        "This difference suggests that some systems provided good similarity judgments on individual genres, but their range of similarity values was not consistent between genres leading to lower overall Pearson correlation.",
        "For instance, in the phrase-to-word comparison type, the aggregated per-genre performance of Duluth-1 and Duluth-3 are among the best whereas their overall Pearson performance puts these systems among the worst-performing ones in the comparison type.",
        "Among the genres, CQA, SLANG, and IDIOMATIC prove to be the more difficult for systems to interpret and judge.",
        "These genres included misspelled, colloquial, or slang language which required converting the text into semantic form in order to meaningfully compare it.",
        "Fur-thermore, as expected, the METAPHORIC genre was the most difficult, with no system performing well; we view the METAPHORIC genre as an open challenge for future systems to address when interpreting larger text.",
        "On the other hand, SCI-ENTIFIC, TRAVEL, and NEWSWIRE tend to be the easiest genres for paragraph-to-sentence and sentence-to-phrase.",
        "All three genres tend to include many named entities or highly-specific lan-guage, which are likely to be more preserved in the more-similar paired items.",
        "Similarly, DESCRIPTIVE and SEARCH genres were easiest in phrase-to-word, which also often featured specific words that were preserved in highly-similar pairs.",
        "In the case of word-to-sense, REGULAR proves to be the least difficult genre.",
        "Interestingly, in word-to-sense, most systems attained moderate performance for comparisons with words not in WordNet (i.e., OOV) but had poor performance for slang words, which were also OOV.",
        "This difference suggests that systems could be improved with additional semantic resources for slang.",
        "Spearman Rank Analysis Although the goal of Task 3 is to have systems produce similarity judg-ments, some applications may benefit from simply having a ranking of pairs, e.g., ranking summa-rizations by goodness.",

        "Both systems were unsupervised and produced similarity values that did not correlate well with those of humans.",
        "However, their Spearman ranks demonstrate the systems ability to correctly identify relative similarity and suggests that such unsupervised systems could improve their Pearson correlation by using the training data to tune the range of similarity values to match those of humans.",

        "Using a multi-phase annotation proce-dure, we have produced a high-quality data set of 4000 items comprising of various genres, evenly-split between training and test with four types of comparison: paragraph-to-sentence, sentence-to-phrase, phrase-to-word, and word-to-sense.",
        "Nineteen teams submitted 38 systems, with most teams surpassing the baseline system and several systems achieving high performance in multiple types of comparison.",
        "However, a clear performance trend emerged where systems perform well only when the text itself is similar, rather than its underlying meaning.",
        "Nevertheless, the results of Task 3 are highly encouraging and point to clear future objectives for developing CLSS systems that operate on more semantic representations rather than text.",
        "In future work on CLSS evaluation, we first intend to develop scalable annotation methods to increase the data sets.",
        "Second, we plan to add new evaluations where systems are tested according to their performance in an application related to each comparison-type, such as measuring the quality of a paraphrase or summary.",
