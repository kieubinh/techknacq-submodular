        "In this paper we describe a system participating in the SemEval2014 Task-6 on Supervised Semantic Parsing of Robotic Spatial Commands.",
        "It produces a semantic parse of natural language commands addressed to a robot arm designed to move objects on a grid surface.",
        "Each command directs a robot to change position of an object given a current configuration.",
        "A command uniquely identifies an object and its destination, for example ?Move the turquoise pyramid above the yellow cube?.",
        "System output is a Robot Control Language (RCL) parse (see Figure 1) which is processed by the robot arm simulator.",
        "The Robot Spatial Commands dataset (Dukes, 2013) is used for training and testing.",
        "Our system uses a Tag&Parse approach which separates semantic tagging and semantic parsing stages.",
        "It has four components: 1) semantic tag-ging, 2) parsing, 3) reference resolution, and 4) spatial validation.",
        "The first three are trained using LLAMA (Haffner, 2006), a supervised machine learning toolkit, on the RCL-parsed sentences.",
        "Licence details: http: //creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ For semantic tagging, we train a maximum entropy sequence tagger for assigning a semantic label and value to each word in a sentence, such as type cube or color blue.",
        "For parsing, we train a constituency parser on non-lexical RCL semantic trees.",
        "For reference resolution, we train a maximum entropy model that identifies entities for reference tags found by previous components.",
        "All of these components can generate multiple hypotheses.",
        "Spatial validation re-ranks these hypotheses by validating them against the input spatial configuration.",
        "The top hypothesis after re-ranking is returned by the system.",
        "Separating tagging and parsing stages has several advantages.",
        "A tagging stage allows the system flexibility to abstract from possible grammatical or spelling errors in a command.",
        "It assigns a semantic category to each word in a sentence.",
        "Words not contributing to the semantic meaning are assigned ?O?",
        "label by the tagger and are ignored in the further processing.",
        "Words that are misspelled can potentially receive a correct tag when a word similarity feature is used in building a tagging model.",
        "This will be especially important when processing output of spoken commands that may contain recognition errors.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized thusly.",
        "In Section 2 we describe each of the components used in our system.",
        "In Section 3 we describe the results reported for SemEval2014 and evaluation of each system component.",
        "We summarize our findings and present future work in Section 4.",
        "2 System 2.1 Sequence Tagging A sequence tagging approach is used for conditional inference of tags given a word sequence.",
        "It is used for many natural language tasks, such as part of speech (POS) and named entity tagging (Toutanova and others, 2003; Carreras et al., 2003).",
        "We train a sequence tagger for assign-109 Figure 1: RCL tree for a sentence Move the turquoise pyramid above the yellow cube.",
        "Word index tag label Move 1 action move the 2 O turquoise 3 color cyan pyramid 4 type prism above 5 relation above the 6 O yellow 7 color yellow cube 8 type cube Table 1: Tagging labels for a sentence Move the turquoise pyramid above the yellow cube.",
        "ing a combined semantic tag and label (such as type cube) to each word in a command.",
        "The tags used for training are extracted from the leaf-level nodes of the RCL trees.",
        "Table 2 shows tags and labels for a sample sentence ?Move the turquoise pyramid above the yellow cube?",
        "extracted from the RCL parse tree (see Figure 1).",
        "In some cases, a label is the same as a word (yellow, cube) while in other cases, it differs (turquoise - cyan, pyramid - prism).",
        "We train a sequence tagger using LLAMA maximum entropy (maxent) classification (Haffner, 2006) to predict the combined semantic tag and label of each word.",
        "Neighboring words, immediately neighboring semantic tags, and POS tags are used as features, where the POS tagger is another sequence tagging model trained on the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "We also experimented with a tagger that assigns tags and labels in separate sequence tagging models, but it performed poorly.",
        "2.2 Parsing We use a constituency parser for building RCL trees.",
        "The input to the parser is a sequence of tags assigned by a sequence tagger, such as ?ac- tion color type relation color type?",
        "for the example in Figure 1.",
        "The parser generates multiple RCL parse tree hypotheses sorted in the order of their likelihood.",
        "The likelihood of a tree T given a sequence of tags T is determined using a probabilistic context free grammar (PCFG) G: P (T |S) = ?",
        "r?T P G (r) (1) The n-best parses are obtained using the CKY algorithm, recording the n-best hyperedge back-pointers per constituent along the lines of (Huang and Chiang, 2005).",
        "G was obtained and P G was estimated from a corpus of non-lexical RCL trees generated by removing all nodes descendant from the tag nodes (action, color, etc.).",
        "Parses may contain empty nodes not corresponding to any tag in the input sequence.",
        "These are hypothesized by the parser at positions in between input tags and inserted as edges according to the PCFG, which has probabilistic rules for generating empty nodes.",
        "2.3 Reference Resolution Reference resolution identifies the most probable antecedent for each anaphor within a text (Hirschman and Chinchor, 1997).",
        "It applies when multiple candidates antecedents are present.",
        "For example, in a sentence ?Pick up the red cube standing on a grey cube and place it on top of the yellow one?, the anaphor it has two candidate antecedents corresponding to entity segments the red cube and a grey cube.",
        "In our system, anaphor and antecedents are represented by reference tags occurring in one sentence.",
        "A reference tag is either assigned by a sequence tagger to one of the words (e.g. to a pronoun) or is inserted into a tree by the parser (e.g. ellipsis).",
        "We train a binary maxent model for this task using LLAMA.",
        "The input is a pair consisting of an anaphor and a candidate antecedent, along with their features.",
        "110 Features that are used include the preceding and following words as well as the tags/labels of both the anaphor and candidate antecedent.",
        "The reference resolution component selects the antecedent for which the model returns the highest score.",
        "2.4 Spatial Validation SemEval2014 Task6 provided a spatial planner which takes an RCL command as an input and determines if that command is executable in the given spatial context.",
        "At each step described in 2.1?2.3, due to the statistical nature of our ap-proach, multiple hypotheses can be easily computed with different confidence values.",
        "We used the spatial planner to validate the final output RCL commands from the three steps by checking if the RCLs are executable or not.",
        "We generate multiple tagger output hypotheses.",
        "For each tagger output hypothesis, we generate multiple parser output hypotheses.",
        "For each parser output hypothe-sis, we generate multiple reference resolution output hypotheses.",
        "The resulting output hypotheses are ranked in the order of confidence scores with the highest tagging output scores ranked first, followed by the parsing output scores, and, finally, reference resolution output scores.",
        "The system returns the result of the top scored command that is valid according to the spatial validator.",
        "In many applications, there can be a tool or method to validate tag/parse/reference outputs fully or partially.",
        "Note that in our system the validation is performed after all output is generated.",
        "Tightly coupled validation, such as checking validity of a tagged entity or a parse constituent, could help in computing hypotheses at each step (e.g., feature values based on possible entities or actions) and it remains as future work.",
        "3 Results In this section, we present evaluation results on the three subsets of the data summarized in Table 3.",
        "In the TEST2500 data set, the models are trained on the initial 2500 sentences of the Robot Commands Treebank and evaluated on the last 909 sentences (this corresponds to the data split of the SemEval task).",

        "Tagging accuracy on TEST2500 using 1-best is 86.0%.",
        "Considering max-5 best tagging sequences, the accuracy is 95.2%.",
        "On the TEST500 data set tagging accuracy is 67.9% and 83.8% on 1-best and max-5 best sequences respectively, approximately 8% points lower than on TEST2500 data set.",
        "On the DEV2500 data set tagging accuracy is 90.8% and 98.0% on 1-best and max-5 best sequences, 4.8% and 2.8% points higher than on the TEST2500 data set.",
        "The higher performance on DEV2500 in comparison to the TEST2500 can be explained by the higher complexity of the test sentences in comparison to the training sentences in the TEST2500 data set.",
        "3.2 RCL Parsing Parsing was evaluated using the EVALB scoring metric (Collins, 1997).",
        "Its 1-best F-measure accuracy on gold standard TEST2500 and DEV2500 semantic tag sequences was 96.17% and 95.20%, respectively.",
        "On TEST500, its accuracy remained 95.20%.",
        "On TEST2500 with system provided input sequences, its accuracy was 94.79% for 869 out of 909 sentences that were tagged correctly.",

        "because relation specification in (Dukes, 2013) doesn't have ?front?",
        "even though annotations included cases with ?front?",

        "Reference resolution is applied to the resulting parse trees.",
        "We compare the results of the models trained on the data sets of size 500 (TEST500) and 2500 (TEST2500) sentences.",
        "We observe that sequence tagging model degrades significantly on a smaller data set.",
        "Parsing and reference resolution models, on the other hand, perform nearly as well on both training sizes.",
        "We compare the results of the models trained on more (DEV2500) and less (TEST2500) homogeneous training/testing data sets.",
        "We observe that a semantic tagging model is more sensitive to the difference between training and test set than parsing model degrading significantly a less homogeneous data set.",
        "Our results show that 1) both tagging and parsing models will benefit from an improved re-ranking, and 2) our parsing model is robust to a data size reduction while tagging model requires a larger training data set.",
        "In future work we plan to explore how Tag&Parse approach will generalize in other domains.",
        "In particular, we are interested in using a combination of domain-specific tagging models and generic semantic parsing (Das et al., 2010) for processing spoken commands in a dialogue system.",
