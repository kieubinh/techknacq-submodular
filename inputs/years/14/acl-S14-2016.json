        "Grammar induction is the task of inducing high-level rules for application of grammars in spoken dialogue systems.",
        "In practice, we can extract relevant rules and the task of grammar induction reduces to finding similar rules between two strings.",
        "As these strings are not necessarily similar in surface form, what we really wish to calculate is the semantic similarity between these strings.",
        "As such, we could think of applying a semantic analysis method.",
        "As such we attempt to apply topic modelling, that is methods such as Latent Dirich-let Allocation (Blei et al., 2003), Latent Semantic Analysis (Deerwester et al., 1990) or Explicit Semantic Analysis (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007).",
        "In particular we build on the recent work to unify latent and explicit methods by means of orthonormal explicit topics.",
        "In topic modelling the key choice is the document space that will act as the corpus and hence topic space.",
        "The standard choice is to regard all articles from a background document collection ?",
        "Wikipedia articles are a typical choice ?",
        "as the ",
        "topic space.",
        "However, it is crucial to ensure that these topics cover the semantic space evenly and completely.",
        "Following McCrae et al. (McCrae et al., 2013) we remap the semantic space defined by the topics in such a manner that it is orthonormal.",
        "In this way, each document is mapped to a topic that is distinct from all other topics.",
        "The structure of the paper is as follows: we describe our method in three parts, first the method in section 2, followed by approximation method in section 3, the normalization methods in section 4 and finally the application to grammar induction in section 5, we finish with some conclusions in section 6.",
        "2 Orthonormal explicit topic analysis ONETA (McCrae et al., 2013, Orthonormal explicit topic analysis) follows Explicit Semantic Analysis in the sense that it assumes the availability of a background document collection B = {b 1 , b 2 , ..., b N } consisting of textual representations.",

        "A simple minimal criterion for a good background document collection is that each document in this collection should be maximally similar to itself and less similar to any other document: ?i 6= j 1 = sim(b j , b j ) > sim(b i , b j ) ?",

        "That is if we have a rule of the form LEAVING FROM <CITY> We would replace the instance of <CITY> with a known terminal for this rule, e.g., leaving from Berlin This reduces the task to that of string similarity which can be processed by means of any string similarity function, for example such as the ONETA function described above.",

        "Ground each candidate matching rule to an English string d i 3.",
        "Calculate for each d i , the similarity sim ONETA (d, d i ) 4.",
        "Add the rule to the grammar class with the highest similarity This approach has the obvious drawback that it removes all information about the valence of the rule, however the effect of this loss of information remains unclear.",
        "For application, we used 20,000 Wikipedia ar-ticles, filtered to contain only those of over 100 words, giving us a corpus of 15.6 million tokens.",
        "We applied ONETA using document normalization but no term normalization and the valueN 1 = 5000.",
        "These parameters were chosen based on the best results in previous experiments.",
        "6 Conclusions The results show that such a naive approach is not directly applicable to the case of grammar in-duction, however we believe that it is possible that the subtle semantic similarities captured by topic modelling may yet prove useful for grammar induction.",
        "However it is clear from the presented results that the use of a topic model alone does not suffice to solve this task.",
        "We notice that from the data many of the distinctions rely on antonyms and stop words, especially distinctions such as ?to?/?from?, which are not captured by a topic model as topic models generally ignore stop words, and generally consider antonyms to be in the same topic, as they frequently occur together in text.",
        "The question of when semantic similarity such as provided by topic modelling is applicable remains an open question.",
