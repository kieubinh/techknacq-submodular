        "The task of broad coverage semantic dependency parsing aims to provide a shallow semantic analysis of text not limited to a specific domain.",
        "As distinct from deeper semantic analysis (e.g., parsing to a full lambda-calculus logical form), shallow semantic parsing captures relationships between pairs of words or concepts in a sentence, and has wide application for information extraction, knowledge base population, and question answering (among others).",
        "We present here two systems that produce semantic dependency parses in the three formalisms of the SemEval 2014 Shared Task 8 on Broad-Coverage Semantic Dependency Parsing (Oepen et al., 2014).",
        "These systems generate parses by extracting features for each potential dependency arc and learning a statistical model to discriminate between good arcs and bad; the first treats each labeled edge decision as an independent multiclass logistic regression (?3.2.1), while the second predicts arcs as part of a graph-based structured support vector machine (?3.2.2).",
        "Common to both models is a rich set of features on arcs, described in ?3.2.3.",
        "We include a discussion of features found to have no discernable effect, or negative effect, during development (?4).",

        "We present our results in ?5.",
        "2 Formalisms The Shared Task 8 dataset consists of annotations of the WSJ Corpus in three different semantic dependency formalisms.",
        "DM is derived from LinGO English Resource Grammar (ERG) annotations in DeepBank (Flickinger et al., 2012).",
        "PAS is derived from the Enju HPSG treebank using the conversion rules of Miyao et al. (2004).",
        "PCEDT is derived from the tectogrammatical layer of the Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank (Haji?c, 1998).",
        "See Figure 1 for an example.",
        "The three formalisms come from very different linguistic theories, but all are represented as labeled directed graphs, with words as vertices, and all have ?top?",
        "annotations, corresponding roughly to the semantic focus of the sentence.",
        "(A ?top?",
        "need not be a root of the graph.)",
        "This allows us to use the same machinery (?3) for training and testing statistical models for the three formalisms.",
        "3 Models We treat the problem as a three-stage pipeline.",
        "The first stage prunes words by predicting whether they have any incoming or outgoing edges at all (?3.1); if a word does not, then it is not considered for any attachments in later stages.",
        "The second stage 176 predicts where edges are present, and their labels (?3.2).",
        "The third stage predicts whether a predicate word is a top or not (?3.3).",
        "Formalisms sometimes annotate more than one ?top?",
        "per sentence, but we found that we achieve the best performance on all formalisms by predicting only the one best-scoring ?top?",
        "under the model.",
        "3.1 Singleton Classification For each formalism, we train a classifier to recognize singletons, nodes that have no parents or children.",
        "(For example, punctuation tokens are often singletons.)",
        "This makes the system faster without affecting accuracy.",
        "For singleton prediction, we use a token-level logistic regression classifier, with features including the word, its lemma, and its part-of-speech tag.",
        "If the classifier predicts a probability of 99% or higher the token is pruned; this removes around 10% of tokens.",
        "(The classifier performs differently on different formalisms; on PAS it has perfect accuracy, while on DM and PCEDT accuracy is in the mid-90?s.)",
        "3.2 Edge Prediction In the second stage of the pipeline, we predict the set of labeled directed edges in the graph.",
        "We use the same set of edge-factored features (?3.2.3) in two alternative models: an edge-independent multiclass logistic regression model (LOGISTICEDGE, ?3.2.1); and a structured SVM (Taskar et al., 2003; Tsochantaridis et al., 2004) that enforces a determinism constraint for certain labels, which allows each word to have at most one outgoing edge with that label (SVMEDGE, ?3.2.2).",
        "For each formalism, we trained both models with varying features enabled and hyperparameter settings and submitted the configuration that produced the best labeled F 1 on the development set.",
        "For DM and PCEDT, this was LOGISTICEDGE; for PAS, this was SVMEDGE.",
        "We report results only for the submitted configu-rations, with different features enabled.",
        "Due to time constraints, full hyperparameter sweeps and comparable feature sweeps were not possible.",

        "This seemed to optimize faster than L-BFGS (Liu and Nocedal, 1989), at least for earlier iterations, though we did no systematic comparison.",
        "Stochastic gradient steps are applied one at a time from individual examples, and a gradient step for the regularizer is applied once per epoch.",
        "The output labels have a class imbalance; in all three formalisms, there are many more NOEDGE examples than true edge examples.",
