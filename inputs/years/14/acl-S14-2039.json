        "Semantic textual similarity (STS), in the context of short text fragments, has drawn considerable attention in recent times.",
        "Its application spans a multitude of areas, including natural language pro-cessing, information retrieval and digital learning.",
        "Examples of tasks that benefit from STS include text summarization, machine translation, question answering, short answer scoring, and so on.",
        "The annual series of SemEval STS tasks (Agirre et al., 2012; Agirre et al., 2013; Agirre et al., 2014) is an important platform where STS systems are evaluated on common data and evaluation criteria.",
        "In this article, we describe an STS system which participated and outperformed all other systems at SemEval 2014.",
        "The algorithm is a straightforward application of the monolingual word aligner presented in (Sul- ",
        "tan et al., 2014).",
        "This aligner aligns related words in two sentences based on the following properties of the words: 1.",
        "They are semantically similar.",
        "2.",
        "They occur in similar semantic contexts in the respective sentences.",
        "The output of the word aligner for a sentence pair can be used to predict the pair's semantic similarity by taking the proportion of their aligned content words.",
        "Intuitively, the more semantic components in the sentences we can meaningfully align, the higher their semantic similarity should be.",
        "In experiments on STS 2013 data reported by Sultan et al. (2014), this approach was found highly effective.",
        "We also adopt this hypothesis of semantic compositionality for STS 2014.",
        "We implement an STS algorithm that is only slightly different from the algorithm in (Sultan et al., 2014).",
        "The approach remains equally successful on STS 2014 data.",
        "2 Background We focus on two relevant topics in this section: the state of the art of STS research, and the word aligner presented in (Sultan et al., 2014).",
        "2.1 Semantic Textual Similarity Since the inception of textual similarity research for short text, perhaps with the studies reported by Mihalcea et al. (2006) and Li et al. (2006), the topic has spawned significant research interest.",
        "The majority of systems have been reported as part of the SemEval 2012 and *SEM 2013 STS tasks (Agirre et al., 2012; Agirre et al., 2013).",
        "Here we confine our discussion to systems that participated in these tasks.",
        "With designated training data for several test sets, supervised systems were the most successful in STS 2012 (B?ar et al., 2012; ?",
        "Sari?c et al., 2012; 241 Jimenez et al., 2012).",
        "Such systems typically apply a regression algorithm on a large number of STS features (e.g., string similarity, syntactic similarity and word or phrase-level semantic similar-ity) to generate a final similarity score.",
        "This approach continued to do well in 2013 (Han et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2013; Shareghi and Bergler, 2013) even without domain-specific training data, but the best results were demonstrated by an unsupervised system (Han et al., 2013).",
        "This has important implications for STS since extraction of each feature adds to the latency of a supervised system.",
        "STS systems are typically important in the context of a larger system rather than on their own, so high latency is an obvious drawback for such systems.",
        "We present an STS system that has simplicity, high accuracy and speed as its design goals, can be deployed without any supervision, operates in a linguistically principled manner with purely semantic sentence properties, and was the top system at SemEval STS 2014.",
        "2.2 The Sultan et al. (2014) Aligner The word aligner presented in (Sultan et al., 2014) has been used unchanged in this work and plays a central role in our STS algorithm.",
        "We give only an overview here; for the full details, see the original article.",
        "We will denote the sentences being aligned (and are subsequently input to the STS algorithm) as S (1) and S (2) .",
        "We describe only content word alignment here; stop words are not used in our STS computation.",
        "The aligner first identifies word pairs w (1) i ?",
        "S (1) and w (2) j ?",
        "S (2) such that: 1. w (1) i and w (2) j have non-zero semantic simi-larity, sim Wij .",
        "The calculation of sim Wij is described in Section 2.2.1.",
        "2.",
        "The semantic contexts of w (1) i and w (2) j have some similarity, sim Cij .",
        "We define the semantic context of a word w in a sentence S as a set of words in S, and the semantic context of the word pair (w (1) i , w (2) j ), denoted by context ij , as the Cartesian product of the context of w (1) i in S (1) and the context of w (2) j in S (2) .",
        "We define several types of context (i.e., several selections of words) and describe the corresponding calculations of sim Cij in Section 2.2.2.",
        "3.",
        "There are no competing pairs scoring higher Align identical word sequences Align named entities Align content words using dependencies Align content words using surrounding words Figure 1: The alignment pipeline.",
        "than (w (1) i , w (2) j ) under f(sim W , sim C ) = 0.9 ?",
        "sim W + 0.1 ?",
        "sim C .",
        "That is, there are no pairs (w (1) k , w (2) j ) such that f(sim Wkj , sim Ckj ) > f(sim Wij , sim Cij ), and there are no pairs (w (1) i , w (2) l ) such that f(sim Wil , sim Cil ) > f(sim Wij , sim Cij ).",
        "The weights 0.9 and 0.1 were derived empirically via a grid search in the range [0, 1] (with a step size of 0.1) to maximize alignment performance on the training set of the (Brockett, 2007) alignment corpus.",
        "This set contains 800 human-aligned sentence pairs collected from a textual entailment corpus (Bar-Haim et al., 2006).",
        "The aligner then performs one-to-one word alignments in decreasing order of the f value.",
        "This alignment process is applied in four steps as shown in Figure 1; each step applies the above process to a particular type of context: identical words, dependencies and surrounding content words.",
        "Additionally, named entities are aligned in a separate step (details in Section 2.2.2).",
        "Words that are aligned by an earlier module of the pipeline are not allowed to be re-aligned by downstream modules.",
        "2.2.1 Word Similarity Word similarity (sim W ) is computed as follows: 1.",
        "If the two words or their lemmas are identi-cal, then sim W = 1.",
        "2.",
        "If the two words are present as a pair in the lexical XXXL corpus of the Paraphrase Database 1 (PPDB) (Ganitkevitch et al., 2013), then sim W = 0.9.",
        "2 For this step, PPDB was augmented with lemmatized forms of the already existing word pairs.",
        "3 1 PPDB is a large database of lexical, phrasal and syntactic paraphrases.",
        "2 Again, the value 0.9 was derived empirically via a grid search in [0, 1] (step size = 0.1) to maximize alignment performance on the (Brockett, 2007) training data.",
        "3 The Python NLTK WordNetLemmatizer was used to lemmatize the original PPDB words.",
        "242 3.",
        "For any other word pair, sim W = 0.",
        "2.2.2 Contextual Similarity Contextual similarity (sim C ) for a word pair (w (1) i , w (2) j ) is computed as the sum of the word similarities for each pair of words in the context of (w (1) i , w (2) j ).",

        "Identical Word Sequences.",
        "Contextual similarity for identical word sequences (a word sequence W which is present in both S (1) and S (2) and contains at least one content word) defines the context by pairing up each word in the instance of W in S (1) with its occurrence in the instance of W in S (2) .",
        "All such sequences with length ?",
        "2 are aligned; longer sequences are aligned before shorter ones.",
        "This simple step was found to be of very high precision in (Sultan et al., 2014) and reduces the overall computational cost of alignment.",
        "Named Entities.",
        "Named entities are a special case in the alignment pipeline.",
        "Even though the context for a named entity is defined in the same way as it is defined for any other content word (as described below), named entities are aligned in a separate step before other content words because they have special properties such as corefer-ring mentions of different lengths (e.g. Smith and John Smith, BBC and British Broadcasting Cor-poration).",

        "and w (1) 4 = w (2) 4 = ?book?",
        "in this pair.",
        "Now, each of the two following typed dependencies: dobj(w (1) 2 , w (1) 4 ) in S (1) and rc-mod(w (2) 4 , w (2) 6 ) in S (2) , represents the relation ?thing that was written?",
        "between the verb ?wrote?",
        "and its argument ?book?.",
        "Thus, to summarize, an instance of contextual evidence for a possible alignment between the pair (w (1) 2 , w (2) 6 ) (?wrote?)",
        "lies in the pair (w (1) 4 , w (2) 4 ) (?book?)",

        "If there are no word pairs with identical or equivalent dependencies as defined above, i.e. if sim Cij = 0, then w (1) i and w (2) j will not be aligned by this module.",
        "Surrounding Content Words.",
        "Surrounding-word-based contextual similarity defines the context of a word in a sentence as a fixed window of 3 words to its left and 3 words to its right.",
        "Only content words in the window are considered.",
        "(As explained in the beginning of this section, the context of the pair (w (1) i , w (2) j ) is then the Cartesian product of the context of w (1) i in S (1) and w (2) j in S (2) .)",
        "Note that w (1) i and w (2) j can be of different lexical categories here.",
        "A content word can often be surrounded by stop words which provide almost no information about its semantic context.",

        "But further experiments are necessary to determine the best span in the context of alignment.",
        "Unlike dependency-based alignment, even if there are no similar words in the context, i.e. if sim Cij = 0, w (1) i may still be aligned to w (2) j if sim Wij > 0 and no alignments for w (1) i or w (2) j have been found by earlier stages of the pipeline.",
        "2.2.3 The Alignment Sequence The rationale behind the specific sequence of alignment steps (Figure 1) was explained in (Sul- tan et al., 2014): (1) Identical word sequence alignment was found to be the step with the highest precision in experiments on the (Brock- ett, 2007) training data, (2) It is convenient to align named entities before other content words to enable alignment of entity mentions of different lengths, (3) Dependency-based evidence was observed to be more reliable (i.e. of higher preci-sion) than textual evidence on the (Brockett, 2007) training data.",
        "3 Method Our STS score is a function of the proportions of aligned content words in the two input sentences.",
        "The proportion of content words in S (1) that are aligned to some word in S (2) is: prop (1) Al = |{i : [?j : (i, j) ?",
        "Al] and w (1) i ?",

        "C}| where C is the set of all content words in English and Al are the predicted word alignments.",

        "The proportion of aligned content words in S (2) , prop (2) Al , can be computed in a similar way.",

        "The drop in correlation with human annotations is a consequence of this role reversal.",
        "This result again shows the importance of a proper selection of stop words for STS and also points to the challenges associated with making such a selection.",
