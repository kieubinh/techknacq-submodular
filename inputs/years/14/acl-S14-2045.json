        "Abstract",
        "This paper describes the system used in Task-7 (Analysis of Clinical Text) of SemEval-2014 for detecting disorder mentions and associating them with their related CUI of UMLS 1 .",
        "For Task-A, a CRF based sequencing algorithm was used to find different medical entities and a binary SVM classifier was used to find relationship between entities.",
        "For Task-B, a dictionary look-up algorithm on a customized UMLS-2012 dictionary was used to find relative CUI for a given disorder mention.",
        "The system achieved F-score of 0.714 for Task A & accuracy of 0.599 for Task B when trained only on training data set, and it achieved F-score of 0.755 for Task A & accuracy of 0.646 for Task B when trained on both training as well as development data set.",
        "Our system was placed 3rd for both task A and B. 1 Introduction A clinical document contains plethora of information regarding patient's medical condition in unstructured format.",
        "So a sophisticated NLP system built specifically for clinical domain can be very useful in many different clinical applications.",
        "In recent years, clinical NLP has gained a lot of significance in research community because it contains challenging tasks such as medical entity recognition, abbreviation disambiguation, inter-conceptual relationship detection, anaphora res-olution, and text summarization.",
        "Clinical NLP has also gained a significant attraction among the 1 http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/ This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",

        "Task-7 of SemEval-2014 was in continuation of the 2013 ShaRe/CLEF Task-1 (Sameer Prad-han, et al., 2013).",
        "This task was about finding disorder mentions from the clinical text and associating them with their related CUIs (concept unique identifiers) as given in the UMLS (Unified Medical Language System).",
        "UMLS is the largest available medical knowledge resource.",
        "It contains 2,885,877 different CUIs having 6,497,937 different medical terms from over 100 different medical vocabularies.",
        "Finding accurate CUIs from free clinical text can be very helpful in many healthcare applications.",
        "Our aim for participating in this task was to explore new techniques of finding CUIs from clinical document.",
        "Over the last few years many different Clinical NLP systems like cTAKES (Savova, Guer-gana K., et al., 2010), MetaMap (A. Aronson, 2001), MedLEE (C. Friedman et al., 1994) have been developed to extract medical concepts from a clinical document.",
        "Most of these systems focus on rule based, medical knowledge driven dictionary look-up approaches.",
        "In very recent past, a few attempts have been made to use supervised or semi-supervised learning models.",
        "In 2009, Yefang Wang (Wang et al., 2009) used cascading classifiers on manually annotated data which fetched F-score of 0.832.",
        "In 2010, i2b2 shared task challenge focused on finding test, treatment and problem mentions from clinical document.",
        "In 2013, ShARe/CLEF task focused on finding disorder mentions from clinical document and assigning relevant CUI code to it.",
        "In both i2b2 task and ShaRe/CLEF task most of the systems used either supervised or semi-supervised learning ap-278 proaches.",
        "In this paper we have proposed a hybrid supervised learning approach based on CRF and SVM to find out disorder mentions from clinical documents and a dictionary look-up approach on a customized UMLS meta-thesaurus to find corresponding CUI.",
        "2 Data The SemEval-2014 corpus comprises of de-identified plain text from MIMIC 2 version 2.5 database.",
        "A disorder mention was defined as any span of text which can be mapped to a concept in UMLS and which belongs to the Disorder semantic group.",
        "There were 431 notes extracted from intensive care unit having various clinical report types (like radiology, discharge summary, echocardiogram and ECG), out of which 99 notes were used in development data set, 199 notes were used in training data set and 133 notes were used in testing data set.",
        "Preliminary analysis on this data showed that number of sentences in training documents were comparatively smaller than the development or test data set (Table 1).",
        "Number of disorder mentions were also significantly lower in training data set than in development data set (Table 1).",

        "3 System Design Analysis of Task-A showed that disorder mentions also contain other UMLS semantic types like findings, anatomical sites and modifiers (Table 2).",
        "So we divided the task of finding disorder mention in to two subtasks.",
        "First a CRF based sequencing model was used to find different disorder mentions, modifiers, anatomical sites and findings.",
        "2 http://mimic.physionet.org/database/ releases/70-version-25.html Then a binary SVM classifier was used to check if relationship exists between a disorder and other types of entities or not.",

        "A preliminary analysis of UMLS entities in general show that a single disorder mention may consist of various types of linguistic phrases.",
        "It is not necesarry that the system to detect these entities as a single phrase.",
        "The entities and their relations may also occur in disjoint phrases as well.",
        "Our analysis of the disorder entities inside UMLS reveals that out of a total 278,859 disorders (based on SNOMED-CT library), 96,069 are such that can be broken down into more than one phrase, which is roughly 1/3 of total number of disorders in the UMLS.",
        "3.1 System Workflow The Work-flow of the system is as follow: 279 Figure 1: System Workflow 3.1.1 Pre-processing All the clinical documents used in this task were de-identified.",
        "So information related to hospital name, patient demographics, physician names/signatures, dates, places, and certain lab-data were converted into predefined patterns.",
        "These patterns were hindering the flow of natural language.",
        "As a result of it, we were unable to get accurate results for PoS tagging and chunking of the sentences.",
        "So we replaced all of these de-identified patterns with some text that appear more as natural language.",
        "There were also some headers and footers associated with all the documents, which were actually irrelevant to this task.",
        "Therefore all headers and footers were also removed at the pre-processing level.",
        "3.1.2 openNLP We have used openNLP 3 to perform basic NLP tasks like sentence detection, tokenizing, PoS tag-ging, chunking, parsing and stemming.",
        "3.1.3 Dictionary Lookup UMLS 2012AA dictionary with Lexical Variant Generator (LVG) 4 was used to perform dictionary lookup task.",
        "Even though the task was only about finding disorder mentions, we also identified entities like procedures, finding, lab data, medicine, anatomical site and medical devices to be used as features in our CRF model.",
        "This was helpful in decreasing the number of false positive.",
        "UMLS TUI (Type Unique Identifier) used for different entity type is described in Table 3.",

        "1) Clinical Features i) Section Headers: A clinical note is often divided into relevant segments called Section Headers.",
        "These section headers provide very useful information at the discourse level.",
        "Same section header can have multiple variants.",
        "For example History of Present Illness can also be written as HPI, HPIS, Brief History etc.",
        "We have created a dictionary of more than 550 different section headers and classified them into more than 40 hierarchical categories.",
        "But using only section header dictionary for classification can fetch many false 3 https://opennlp.apache.org/ 4 http://lexsrv2.nlm.nih.gov/ 280 positives.",
        "Section header always appears in a predefined similar sequences.",
        "So to remove these false positives, we have used a Hidden Markov Model(HMM) (Parth Pathak, et al., 2013).",
        "For this task, we have used unigram section header id as a feature for all the tokens in CRF.",
        "ii) Dictionary Lookup: A binary feature was used for all the different entity types detected from UMLS dictionary from last pipeline.",
        "iii) Abbreviations: Abbreviations Disambiguation is one of the most challenging tasks in clinical NLP.",
        "The primary reason for the same is a lack of dictionary which contains most of the valid list of abbreviations.",
        "For this task, we have used LRABR as base dictionary to find out all the possible abbreviations and on top of that, a binary SVM classifier was used to check if the given abbreviation has medical sense or not.",
        "2) Textual Feature: Snowball stemmer 5 was used to find out stem value of all the word tokens.",
        "Prefix and suffix of length 2 to 5 were also used as features.",
        "Different orthographic features like whole word capital, first char capital, numeric values, dates, words containing hyphen or slash, medical units (mg/gram/ltr etc.)",
        "were used as features.",
        "3) Syntactic Features: Different linguistic features like PoS tags and chunks for each token were used.",
        "We have also used head of the noun phrase as one of the feature which can be very helpful in detecting the type of an entity.",
        "3.1.5 CRF toolkit All the annotated data was converted into BIO sequencing format.",
        "CRF++ 6 toolkit was used to train and predict the model.",
        "3.1.6 SVM SVM was used to check whether a relationship exists between two entities or not.",
        "For this purpose all the tokens between these two entities, their part of speech tags and chunks were used as features.",
        "Rules based on output of a syntactic parser were also used as a binary feature.",
        "Some orthographic features like all letter capital, contains colon (:), contains semi colon (;), were also used as features.",

        "3.1.7 Dictionary Look-up for CUI detection For a better mapping of the entities detected by NLP inside the given input text, we found it to be a better approach to divide the UMLS entities into various phrases.",
        "This was done semi-automatically by splitting the strings based on function words such as prepositions, particles and non-nominal word classes such as verbs, adjectives and adverbs.",
        "While most of the disorder entities in UMLS can be contained into a single noun phrase (NP) there are also quite a few that contain multiple NPs related with prepositional phrases (PPs), verb phrases (VPs) and adjectival phrases (ADJPs).",
        "This task gave us a modified version of the UMLS disorder entities along with their CUIs.",
        "The following table (Table 4) gives a snapshot of what this customized UMLS dictionary looked like.",

        "Strict Accuracy = Total correct CUIs Total annotation in gold standard Relaxed Accuracy = Total correct CUIs Total span detected by system 4.2 System Accuracy The system results were calculated on two different runs.",
        "For the first evaluation, only training data was used for the training purpose while for the second evaluation, both the training as well as the development data sets were used for training purpose.",
        "The results for Task A and B are as follows: Precision Recall F-Meas Strict (T) 0.750 0.682 0.714 Relaxed (T) 0.915 0.827 0.869 Strict (T+D) 0.770 0.740 0.755 Relaxed (T+D) 0.911 0.887 0.899 Table 5: Task-A Results where T= Training Data set D= Development Data set 4.3 Error Analysis Error Analysis on training data revealed that for Task-A our system got poor results in detecting non-contiguous disjoint entities.",
        "Our system also performed very poorly in identifying abbreviations and misspelled entities.",

        "For Task-B, we got many false positives.",
        "Many CUIs which we identified from the UMLS were not actually annotated.",
        "5 Conclusion In this paper we have proposed a CRF and SVM based hybrid approach to find Disorder mentions from a given clinical text and a novel dictionary look-up approach for discovering CUIs from UMLS meta-thesaurus.",
        "Our system did produce competitive results and was third best among the participants of this task.",
        "In future, we would like to explore semi-supervised learning approaches to take advantage of large amount of available un-annotated free clinical text.",
