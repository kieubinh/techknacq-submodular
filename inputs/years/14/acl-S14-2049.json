        "Our analysis shows that, under the same condi-tions, the fully CDSM system is still far from being competitive with more complete methods.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the full-fledged recognizing textual entailment system that is used for comparison.",
        "Section 3 introduces a novel compositional distributional semantic model, namely, the distributed smoothed tree kernels, and the way this model is applied to the task of RTE.",
        "Section 4 describes the results in the challenge and it draws some preliminary conclusions.",
        "2 A Standard full-fledged Machine Learning Approach for RTE For now on, the task of recognizing textual entailment (RTE) is defined as the task to decide if a pair p = (a, b) like: (?Two children are lying in the snow and are making snow angels?, ?Two angels are making snow on the lying children?)",
        "is in entailment, in contradiction, or neutral.",
        "As in the tradition of applied machine learn-300 ing models, the task is framed as a multi-classification problem.",
        "The difficulty is to determine the best feature space on which to train the classifier.",
        "A full-fledged RTE systems based on machine learning that has to deal with natural occurring text is generally based on: ?",
        "some within-pair features that model the similarity between the sentence a and the sentence b ?",
        "some features representing more complex information of the pair (a, b) such as rules with variables that fire (Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006) In the following, we describe the within-pair feature and the syntactic rules with variable features used in the full-fledged RTE system.",
        "As the second space of features is generally huge, the full feature space is generally used in kernel machines where the final kernel between two instances p 1 = (a 1 , b 1 ) and p 2 = (a 2 , b 2 ) is: K(p 1 , p 2 ) = FR(p 1 , p 2 ) + + (WTS(a 1 , b 1 ) ?WTS(a 2 , b 2 ) + 1) 2 where FR counts how many rules are in common between p 1 and p 2 and WTS computes a lexical similarity between a and b. In the following sections we describe the nature ofWTS and of FR 2.1 Weighted Token Similarity (WTS) This similarity model was first defined bt Cor-ley and Mihalcea (2005) and since then has been used by many RTE systems.",
        "The model extends a classical bag-of-word model to a Weighted-Bag-of-Word (wbow) by measuring similarity between the two sentences of the pair at the semantic level, instead of the lexical level.",
        "For example, consider the pair: ?Os- cars forgot Farrah Fawcett?, ?Farrah Fawcett snubbed at Academy Awards?.",
        "This pair is redundant, and, hence, should be assigned a very high similarity.",
        "Yet, a bag-of-word model would assign a low score, since many words are not shared across the two sentences.",
        "wbow fixes this problem by matching ?Oscar?-?Academy Awards?",
        "and ?forgot?- ?snubbed?",
        "at the semantic level.",
        "To provide these matches, wbow relies on specific word similarity measures over WordNet (Miller, 1995), that allow synonymy and hyperonymy matches: in our experiments we specifically use Jiang&Conrath similarity (Jiang and Con-rath, 1997).",
        "2.2 Rules with Variables as Features The above model alone is not sufficient to capture all interesting entailment features as the relation of entailment is not only related to the notion of similarity between a and b. In the tradition of RTE, an interesting feature space is the one where each feature represents a rule with variables, i.e. a first order rule that is activated by the pairs if the variables are unified.",
        "This feature space has been introduced in (Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006) and shown to improve over the one above.",
        "Each feature ?fr 1 , fr 2 ?",
        "is a pair of syntactic tree fragments augmented with variables.",
        "The feature is active for a pair (t 1 , t 2 ) if the syntactic interpretations of t 1 and t 2 can be unified with < fr 1 , fr 2 >.",
        "For example, consider the following feature: ?",
        "S P P P \u0010 \u0010 \u0010 NP X VP H H \b \b VBP bought NP Y , S P P \u0010 \u0010 NP X VP H H \b \b VBP owns NP Y ?",
        "This feature is active for the pair (?GM bought Opel?,?GM owns Opel?",
        "), with the variable unification X = ?GM ?",
        "and Y = ?Opel?.",
        "On the contrary, this feature is not active for the pair (?GM bought Opel?,?Opel owns GM ?)",
        "as there is no possibility of unifying the two variables.",
        "FR(p 1 , p 2 ) is a kernel function that counts the number of common rules with variables between p 1 and p 2 .",
        "Efficient algorithms for the computation of the related kernel functions can be found in (Moschitti and Zanzotto, 2007; Zanzotto and Dell?Arciprete, 2009; Zanzotto et al., 2011).",

        "We here propose a model that can be considered a compositional distributional semantic model as it transforms sentences into matrices that are then used by the learner as feature vectors.",
        "Our model is called Distributed Smoothed Tree Kernel (Ferrone and Zanzotto, 2014) as it mixes the distributed trees (Zan- zotto and Dell?Arciprete, 2012) representing syntactic information with distributional semantic vectors representing semantic information.",

        "N(t) has a label l n composed of two parts l n = (s n , w n ): s n is the syntactic label, while w n is the semantic headword of the tree headed by n, along with its part-of-speech tag.",
        "Terminal nodes of trees are treated differently, these nodes represent only words w n without any additional information, and their labels thus only consist of the word itself (see Fig. 2).",
        "The structure of a DST is represented as fol-lows: Given a tree t, h(t) is its root node and s(t) is the tree formed from t but considering only the syntactic structure (that is, only the s n part of the labels), c i (n) denotes i-th child of a node n. As usual for constituency-based parse trees, pre-terminal nodes are nodes that have a single terminal node as child.",

        "In line with tree kernels over structures (Collins and Duffy, 2002), we introduce the set S(t) of the subtrees t i of a given lexicalized tree t. A subtree t i is in the set S(t) if s(t i ) is a subtree of s(t) and, if n is a node in t i , all the siblings of n in t are in t i .",
