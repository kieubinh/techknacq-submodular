        "Abstract",
        "In this paper we briefly describe our supervised machine learning approach for disorder mention detection system that we submitted as part of our participation in the SemEval-2014 Shared task.",
        "The main goal of this task is to build a system that automatically identifies mentions of clinical conditions from the clinical texts.",
        "The main challenge lies due in the fact that the same mention of concept may be represented in many surface forms.",
        "We develop the system based on the supervised machine learning algorithms, namely Conditional Random Field and Support Vector Machine.",
        "One appealing characteristics of our system is that most of the features for learning are extracted automatically from the given training or test datasets without using deep domain specific resources and/or tools.",
        "We submitted three runs, and best performing system is based on Conditional Random Field.",
        "For task A, it shows the precision, recall and F-measure values of 50.00%, 47.90% and 48.90%, respectively under the strict matching criterion.",
        "When the matching criterion is relaxed, it shows the precision, recall and F-measure of 81.50%, 79.70% and 80.60%, respectively.",
        "For task B, we obtain the accuracies of 33.30% and 69.60% for the relaxed and strict matches, respectively."

        "The SemEval-2014 Shared Task 7 is concerned with the analysis of clinical texts, particularly for disorder mention detection and disambiguation.",
        "The purpose of this task is to enhance current research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods used in the clinical domain.",
        "The task is a continuation of the CLEF/eHealth ShARe 2013 Shared Task.",
        "In particular there were two specific tasks, viz. (i).",
        "Task A: To identify disorder mentions from biomedicine domain and (ii) Task B: To classify each mention with respect to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Concept Unique Identifier (CUI).",
        "The task is challenging in the sense that the same mention of concept may be represented in many surface forms and mention may appear in the different parts of texts.",
        "Some systems (Cogley et al., 2013; Zuccon et al., 2013; Tang et al., 2013; Cogley et al., 2013) are available for disorder mention detection.",
        "Looking at the challenges and resources available at our hand we planned to adapt our existing system (Sikdar et al., 2013) for disorder mention detection.",
        "The original architecture was conceptualized as part of our participation in the BioCreative-IV Track-2 Shared Task on Chemical Compound and Drug Name Recognition.",
        "Although our submitted system for SemEval-14 shared task is in line with BioCreative-IV 1 , it has many different features and characteristics.",
        "We develop three systems (e.g. Model-1: sikdar.run-0, Model-2: sikdar.run-1 and Model-3: sikdar.run-2) based on the popular supervised machine learning algorithms, namely Conditional Random Field (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Cortes and Vap-nik, 1995; Joachims, 1999).",
        "The models were developed by varying the features and feature templates.",
        "A baseline model is constructed by using the UMLS MetaMap 2 tool.",
        "During testing we merge the development set with the training set.",
        "Evaluation results on test data with the benchmark set up show the F-measure values of 1 www.biocreative.org/tasks/biocreative-iv/chemdner/ 2 http://mmtx.nlm.nih.gov/ 314 48.90%, 46.50% and 46.50%, respectively under the strict criterion.",
        "Under relaxed matching criterion the models show the F-measure values of 80.60%, 78.20% and 79.60%, respectively.",
        "Our submission for Task-B is simple in nature where we consider only those mentions that are also predicted in the baseline model, i.e. only the common CUIs are considered.",
        "It shows the accuracies of 33.30%, 31.90% and 33.20%, respectively under strict matching criterion; and 69.60%, 69.60% and 69.10%, respectively under the relaxed matching criterion.",
        "2 Method Our method for disorder mention detection from clinical text is based on the supervised machine learning algorithms, namely CRF and SVM.",
        "The key focus was to develop a system that could be easily adapted to other domains and applications.",
        "We submitted three runs defined as below: Model-1:sikdar.run-0: This is based on CRF, and makes use of the features as mentioned below.",
        "Model-2:sikdar.run-1: This model is built by training a SVM classifier with the same set of features as CRF.",
        "Model-3:sikdar.run-2: This model is constructed by defining a heuristics that looks at the outputs of both the models.",
        "For given instance, if one of the models predicts it to belong to the category of candidate disorder mention then this is given more priority in assigning the class.",
        "We observed performance improvement on the development set with this heuristic.",
        "We identify and implement different features, mostly without using any deep domain knowledge or domain-specific external resources and/or tools.",
        "The features that are used to train the classifiers are briefly described below: ?",
        "Context words: Surrounding words carry effective information to identify disorder mention.",
        "In our case we consider the previous three and next three words as the features.",
        "?",
        "MetaMapmatch: MetaMap is a widely used tool that maps biomedical mention to the UMLS CUI 3 .",
        "In UMLS, there are 11 semantic types denoting disorders.",
        "These are Congenital Abnormality, Acquired Abnormality, Injury or Poisoning, Pathologic Function, 3 http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/ Disease or Syndrome, Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction, Cell or Molecular Dysfunction, Experimental Model of Disease, Anatomical Abnormality, Neoplastic Process and Signs and Symptoms.",
        "The training set is passed through the MetaMap, and then we prepare a list of mentions that belong to the UMLS semantic types.",
        "A feature is thereafter defined that takes a value of 1 if the current token appears in the list; otherwise the value becomes 0. ?",
        "Part-of-Speech (PoS) Information: In this work, we use PoS information of the current token as the feature.",
        "PoS information was extracted from the GENIA tagger 4 V2.0.2, which is a freely available resource.",
        "?",
        "Root words: Stems or root words, which are extracted form GENIA tagger V2.0.2, are used as the feature.",
        "?",

        "Each capitalized character of the word is replaced by ?A?, small characters are replaced by ?a?",

        "For the training set this has been set randomly.",
        "?",
        "Word length: If the length of a token is more than a predefined threshold (here 5) then it is most likely a disorder mention.",
        "This feature is defined with the observation that very short words are most probably not disorder mentions.",
