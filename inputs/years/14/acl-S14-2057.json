        "In current era microblogging is an efficient way of communication where people can communicate without physical presence of receiver(s).",
        "Twitter is the medium where people post real time messages to discuss on the different topics, and express their sentiments.",
        "The texts used in twitter are generally informal and unstructured in nature.",
        "Tweets and SMS messages are very short in length, usually a sentence or a headline rather than a document.",
        "These texts are very informal in nature and contains creative spellings and punctuation symbols.",
        "Text also contains lots of mis-spellings, slang, out-of-vocabulary words, URLs, ",
        "and genre-specific terminology and abbreviations, e.g., RT for re-Tweet and #hashtags.",
        "Such kinds of structures introduce difficulties in building various lexical and syntactic resources and/or tools, which are required for efficient processing of texts.",
        "Finding relevant information from these posts poses big challenges to the researchers compared to the traditional text genres such as newswire.",
        "In recent times, there has been a huge interest to mine and understand the opinions and sentiments that people are communicating in social media (Barbosa and Feng, 2010; Bifet et al., ; Pak and Paroubek, 2010; Kouloumpis et al., 2011).",
        "There is a tremendous interest in sentiment analysis of Tweets across a variety of domains such as commerce (Jansen et al., 2009), health (Chew and Eysenbach, 2010; Salathe and Khan-delwal, 2011) and disaster management (Verma et al., 2011; Mandel et al., 2012).",
        "Agarwal et al.(Agarwal et al., 2011) used tree kernel decision tree that made use of the features such as Part-of-Speech (PoS) information, lexicon-based features and several other features.",
        "They acquired 11,875 manually annotated Twitter data (Tweets) from a commercial source, and reported an accuracy of 75.39%.",
        "Semantics has also been used as the feature to improve the performance of sentiment analysis (Saif et al., 2012).",
        "For each extracted entity (e.g. iPhone) from Tweets, they added its semantic concept (e.g. Apple product) as an additional feature.",
        "Thereafter they devised a method to measure the correlation of the representative concept with negative/positive senti-ment, and applied this approach to predict sentiment for three different Twitter datasets.",
        "They showed that semantic features produce better recall and F-score when classifying negative senti-ment, and better precision with lower recall and F-score in positive sentiment classification.",
        "The benchmark corpus were made available with the SemEval-2013 shared task (Nakov et al., 2013) on 341 sentiment analysis in twitter.",
        "The datasets used are from the domains of Tweets and SMS messages.",
        "The datasets were labelled with contextual phrase-level polarity and overall message-level polarity.",
        "Among the 44 submissions, the support vector machine based system proposed in (Mohammad et al., 2013) achieved the highest F-scores of 69.02% for Task A, i.e. the message-level polarity and and 88.93% for Task B, i.e. term-level polarity.",
        "The issues addressed in SemEval-13 are further extended in SemEval-14 shared task 1 .",
        "The same two tasks, viz. Subtask A and Subtask B denoting contextual polarity disambiguation and message polarity classification.",
        "The goal of Subtask A is to determine, for a given message containing a marked instance of a word or phrase, whether that instance is positive, negative or neutral in that context.",
        "Given a message, the task is to classify it with its entirety whether it is positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.",
        "For messages that convey both positive and negative sentiments, the stronger one should be chosen.",
        "In this paper we report on our submitted systems for both the tasks.",
        "Our evaluation for the first task shows the F-scores of 77.99%, 75.99%, 76.54%, 76.43% and 71.43% for LiveJournal2014, SMS2013, Twitter2013, Twitter2014 and Twitter2014Sarcasm, respectively for Subtask A.",
        "For Subtask B we obtain the F-scores of 60.39%, 51.96%, 52.58%, 57.25%, 41.33% for five different test sets, respectively.",
        "2 Methods In this section we describe preprocessing steps, features and our methods for sentiment classification 2.1 Preprocessing of Data The data has to be pre-processed before being used for actual machine learning training.",
        "Each Tweet is processed to extract only those relevant parts that are useful for sentiment classification.",
        "For example, stop words are removed; symbols and punctuation markers are filtered out; URLs are replaced by the word URL etc.",
        "Each Tweet is then passed through the ARK tagger developed by CMU 2 for tokenization and Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging.",
        "1 http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task9/ 2 http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/TweetNLP/ 2.2 Approach Our approach is based on supervised machine learning.",
        "We explored different models such as naive Bayes, decision tree and support vector machine.",
        "Based on the results obtained on the development sets we finally select SVM for both the tasks.",
        "We also carried out a number of experiments with the various feature combinations.",
        "Once the model is fixed with certain feature com-binations, these are finally used for blind evaluation on the test sets for both the tasks.",
        "We submit two runs, one for each task.",
        "Both of our submissions were constrained in nature, i.e. we did not make use of any additional resources and/or tools to build our systems.",
        "We adapt a supervised machine learning algorithm, namely Support Vector Machine (Joachims, 1999; Vapnik, 1995).",
        "We use its sequential minimal optimization version for faster training 3 .",
        "We use the same set of features for both the tasks.",
        "Development sets are used to identify the best feature combinations for both the tasks.",
        "Default parameters as implemented inWeka are used for the SVM experiments.",
        "2.3 Features Like any other classification algorithm, features play an important role for sentiment classification.",
        "For the very first time we participated in this kind of task, and therefore had to spend quite long time in conceptualization and implementation of the features.",
        "We focused on implementing the features without using any domain-dependent resources and/or tools.",
        "Brief descriptions of the features that we use are presented below: ?",
        "Bag-of-words: Bag-of-words in the expression or in the entire Tweet is used as the fea-ture(s).",
        "?",
        "SentiWordNet feature: This feature is defined based on the scores assigned to each word of a Tweet using the SentiWordNet 4 .",
        "A feature vector of length three is defined.",
        "The scores of all words of the phrase or Tweet is summed over and normalized in the scale of 3.",
        "We define the following three thresholds: if the score is less than 0.5 then it is treated to be a negative polarity; for the score above 0.8, it is assumed to contain positive sentiment; 3 http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/jplatt/smo-book.pdf 4 sentiwordnet.isti.cnr.it/ 342 and the polarity is considered to be neutral for all the other words.",
        "Depending upon the score the corresponding bit of the feature vector is set.",
        "?",
        "Stop word: If a Tweet/phrase is having more number of stop words then it most likely contains neutral sentiment.",
        "We obtain the stop words from the Wikipedia 5 .",
        "We assume that a particular Tweet or phrase most likely bears a neutral sentiment if 20% of its words belong to the category of stop words.",
        "?",
        "All Cap Words: This feature is defined to count the number of capitalized words in an entire Tweet/phrase.",
        "More the number of capitalized words, more the chances of being positive or negative sentiment bearing units.",
        "While counting, the words preceded by # are not considered.",
        "We include this with the assumption that the texts written in capitalized letters express the sentiment strongly.",
        "?",
        "Init Cap: The words starting with capitalized letter contribute more towards classifying it.",
        "?",
        "Percent Cap: This feature is based on the percentage of capitalized characters in a Tweet/phrase.",
        "If this is more than 75%, then most likely it is not of neutral type.",
