        "After our participation at SemEval 2013 with LIPN-CORE (Buscaldi et al., 2013) we found that geography has an important role in discriminating the semantic similarity of sentences (especially in the case of newswire).",
        "If two events happened in a different location, their semantic relatedness is usually low, no matter if the events are the same.",
        "Therefore, we worked on a similarity measure able to capture the similarity between the geographic contexts of two sentences.",
        "We tried also to reinforce the semantic similarity features by introducing a new measure that calculates word similarities on co-occurrence distributions extracted from Google Books bigrams.",
        "This measure was introduced only for the Spanish runs, due to time constraints.",
        "The regression model used to integrate the features was the ?-Support Vector Regression ",
        "Licence de-tails:http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ model (?-SVR) (Sch?olkopf et al., 1999) implementation provided by LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011), with a radial basis function kernel with the standard parameters (?",
        "= 0.5).",
        "We describe all the measures in Section 2; the results obtained by the system are detailed in Section 3.",
        "2 Similarity Measures In this section we describe the measures used as features in our system.",
        "The description of measures already used in our 2013 participation is less detailed than the description of the new ones.",
        "Additional details on the measures may be found in (Buscaldi et al., 2013).",
        "When POS tagging and NE recognition were required, we used the Stanford CoreNLP 1 for English and FreeLing 2 3.1 for Spanish.",
        "2.1 WordNet-based Conceptual Similarity This measure has been introduced in order to measure similarities between concepts with respect to an ontology.",
        "The similarity is calculated as fol-lows: first of all, words in sentences p and q are lemmatised and mapped to the related WordNet synsets.",
        "All noun synsets are put into the set of synsets associated to the sentence, C p and C q , respectively.",
        "If the synsets are in one of the other POS categories (verb, adjective, adverb) we look for their derivationally related forms in order to find a related noun synset: if there exists one, we put this synset in C p (or C q ).",
        "No disambiguation process is carried out, so we take all possible meanings into account.",
        "Given C p and C q as the sets of concepts contained in sentences p and q, respectively, with 1 http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml 2 http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling/ 400 |C p | ?",

        "c 1 ?C p max c 2 ?C q s(c 1 , c 2 ) |C p | where s(c 1 , c 2 ) is a conceptual similarity measure.",
        "Concept similarity can be calculated in different ways.",
        "We used a variation of the Wu-Palmer formula (Wu and Palmer, 1994) named ?Proxi- Genea3?, introduced by (Dudognon et al., 2010), which is inspired by the analogy between a family tree and the concept hierarchy in WordNet.",
        "The ProxiGenea3 measure is defined as: s(c 1 , c 2 ) = 1 1 + d(c 1 ) + d(c 2 )?",
        "2 ?",
        "d(c 0 ) where c 0 is the most specific concept that is present both in the synset path of c 1 and c 2 (that is, the Least Common Subsumer or LCS).",
        "The function returning the depth of a concept is noted with d. 2.2 IC-based Similarity This measure has been proposed by (Mihalcea et al., 2006) as a corpus-based measure which uses Resnik's Information Content (IC) and the Jiang-Conrath (Jiang and Conrath, 1997) similarity metric.",
        "This measure is more precise than the one introduced in the previous subsection because it takes into account also the importance of concepts and not only their relative position in the hierarchy.",
        "We refer to (Buscaldi et al., 2013) and (Mihalcea et al., 2006) for a detailed description of the measure.",
        "The idf weights for the words were calculated using the Google Web 1T (Brants and Franz, 2006) frequency counts, while the IC values used are those calculated by Ted Pedersen (Pedersen et al., 2004) on the British National Corpus 3 .",
        "2.3 Syntactic Dependencies This measure tries to capture the syntactic similarity between two sentences using dependencies.",
        "Previous experiments showed that converting constituents to dependencies still achieved best results on out-of-domain texts (Le Roux et al., 2012), so we decided to use a 2-step architecture to obtain syntactic dependencies.",
        "First we parsed pairs of sentences with the LORG parser 4 .",
        "Second we con-3 http://www.d.umn.edu/ tpederse/similarity.html 4 https://github.com/CNGLdlab/LORG-Release verted the resulting parse trees to Stanford dependencies 5 .",
        "Given the sets of parsed dependencies D p and D q , for sentence p and q, a dependency d ?",
        "D x is a triple (l, h, t) where l is the dependency label (for instance, dobj or prep), h the governor and t the dependant.",
        "The similarity measure between two syntactic dependencies d 1 = (l 1 , h 1 , t 1 ) and d 2 = (l 2 , h 2 , t 2 ) is the levenshtein distance between the labels l 1 and l 2 multiplied by the average of idf h ?",

        "NOTE: This measure was used only in the English sub-task.",
        "2.4 Information Retrieval-based Similarity Let us consider two texts p and q, an IR system S and a document collection D indexed by S. This measure is based on the assumption that p and q are similar if the documents retrieved by S for the two texts, used as input queries, are ranked similarly.",

        "The K value was set to 70 after a study detailed in (Buscaldi, 2013).",
        "2.5 N-gram Based Similarity This measure tries to capture the fact that similar sentences have similar n-grams, even if they are not placed in the same positions.",
        "The measure is based on the Clustered Keywords Positional Distance (CKPD) model proposed in (Buscaldi et al., 2009) for the passage retrieval task.",

        "?x?Q h(x, P ) ?",
        "n i=1 w i d(x, x max ) Where P is the set of the heaviest n-grams in p where all terms are also contained in q; Q is the set of all the possible n-grams in q, and n is the total number of terms in the longest sentence.",

        "P 0 otherwise The function d(x, x max ) determines the minimum distance between a n-gram x and the heaviest one x max as the number of words between them.",
        "2.6 Geographical Context Similarity We observed that in many sentences, especially those extracted from news corpora, the compatibility of the geographic context between the sentences is an important clue to determine if the sentences are related or not.",
        "This measure tries to measure if the two sentences refer to events that took place in the same geographical area.",
        "We built a database of geographically-related entities, using geo-WordNet (Buscaldi and Rosso, 2008) and expanding it with all the synsets that are related to a geographically grounded synset.",

        "is associated to ?Afghanistan?, ?Sovietize?",
        "to ?Soviet Union?, etc.",

        "All words in sentence p are compared to the words of sentence q using this similarity value.",
        "The words that are semantically closer are paired; if a word cannot be paired (average distance with any of the words in the other sentence > 10), then it is left unpaired.",
        "The value used as the final feature is the averaged sum of all distance scores.",
        "2.8 Other Measures In addition to the above text similarity measures, we used also the following common measures: Cosine Cosine distance calculated between p = (w p 1 , .",

        ", w q n ), the vectors of tf.idf weights associated to sentences p and q, with idf values calculated on Google Web 1T.",
        "Edit Distance This similarity measure is calculated using the Levenshtein distance on characters between the two sentences.",
        "Named Entity Overlap This is a per-class overlap measure (in this way, ?France?",

        "The definitions were randomly extracted and paired at different similarity levels (taking into 11 http://www.rae.es/ account the Dice coefficient calculated on the definitions bag-of-words).",

        "In Figure 1 we show the results obtained by taking into account each individual feature as a measure of similarity between texts.",
        "These results show that the combination was always better than the single features (as expected), and the feature best able to capture semantic similarity alone was the cosine distance.",
        "In Table 2 we show the results of the ablation test, which shows that the features that most contributed to improve the results were the IR-based similarity for the news dataset and the cosine distance for the Wikipedia dataset.",
