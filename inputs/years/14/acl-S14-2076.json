        "; improving customer relation models; and detecting happiness and well-being.",
        "In many applications, it is important to associate sentiment with a particular entity or an aspect of an entity.",
        "For example, in reviews, customers might express different sentiment towards various aspects of a product or service they have availed.",
        "Consider: The lasagna was great, but the service was a bit slow.",
        "The review is for a restaurant, and we can gather from it that the customer has a positive sentiment towards the lasagna they serve, but a negative sentiment towards the service.",
        "The SemEval-2014 Task 4 (Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis) is a shared task where given a customer review, automatic systems are to determine aspect terms, aspect categories, and sentiment towards these aspect terms and categories.",
        "An aspect term is defined to be an explicit mention of a feature or component of the target product or service.",
        "The example sentence above has Restaurants Laptops Term T-Sent.",
        "Cat.",
        "C-Sent.",

        "Similar aspect terms can be grouped into aspect categories.",
        "For example, lasagna and other food items can be grouped into the aspect category of ?food?.",
        "In Task 4, customer reviews are provided for two domains: restaurants and laptops.",
        "A fixed set of five aspect categories is defined for the restaurant domain: food, ser-vice, price, ambiance, and anecdotes.",
        "Automatic systems are to determine if any of those aspect categories are described in a review.",
        "The example sentence above describes the aspect categories of food (positive sentiment) and service (negative sentiment).",
        "For the laptop reviews, there is no aspect category detection subtask.",
        "Further details of the task and data can be found in the task description paper (Pontiki et al., 2014).",
        "We present an in-house sequence tagger to detect aspect terms and supervised classifiers to detect aspect categories, sentiment towards aspect terms, and sentiment towards aspect categories.",
        "A summary of the ranks obtained by our submissions to the shared task is provided in Table 1.",
        "2 Lexical Resources 2.1 Unlabeled Reviews Corpora Apart from the training data provided for Task 4, we compiled large corpora of reviews for restaurants and laptops that were not labeled for aspect terms, aspect categories, or sentiment.",
        "We generated lexicons from these corpora and used them as a source of additional features in our machine learning systems.",
        "437 Yelp restaurant reviews corpus: The Yelp Phoenix Academic Dataset 1 contains customer reviews posted on the Yelp website.",
        "The businesses for which the reviews are posted are classified into over 500 categories.",
        "Further, many of the businesses are assigned multiple business categories.",
        "We identified all food-related business categories (58 categories) that were grouped along with the category ?restaurant?",
        "and extracted all customer reviews for these categories.",
        "We will refer to this corpus of 183,935 reviews as the Yelp restaurant reviews corpus.",
        "Amazon laptop reviews corpus: McAuley and Leskovec (2013) collected reviews posted on Amazon.com from June 1995 to March 2013.",
        "A subset of this corpus is marked as reviews for electronic products.",
        "We extracted from this subset all reviews that mention either laptop or notebook.",
        "We will refer to this collection of 124,712 reviews as the Amazon laptop reviews corpus.",
        "Both the Yelp and the Amazon reviews have one to five star ratings associated with each review.",
        "We treated the one- and two-star reviews as negative reviews, and the four- and five-star reviews as positive reviews.",
        "2.2 Lexicons Sentiment Lexicons: From the Yelp restaurant reviews corpus, we automatically created an in-domain sentiment lexicon for restaurants.",
        "Following Turney and Littman (2003) and Mohammad et al. (2013), we calculated a sentiment score for each term w in the corpus: score (w) = PMI (w , pos)?PMI (w ,neg) (1) where pos denotes positive reviews and neg denotes negative reviews.",
        "PMI stands for pointwise mutual information: PMI (w , pos) = log 2 freq (w , pos) ?N freq (w) ?",
        "freq (pos) (2) where freq (w, pos) is the number of times a term w occurs in positive reviews, freq (w) is the total frequency of term w in the corpus, freq (pos) is the total number of tokens in positive reviews, and N is the total number of tokens in the corpus.",
        "PMI (w ,neg) was calculated in a similar way.",
        "Since PMI is known to be a poor estimator of association for low-frequency events, we ignored terms that occurred less than five times in each (positive and negative) groups of reviews.",
        "1 http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge A positive sentiment score indicates a greater overall association with positive sentiment, whereas a negative score indicates a greater association with negative sentiment.",
        "The magnitude is indicative of the degree of association.",
        "Negation words (e.g., not, never) can significantly affect the sentiment of an expression (Zhu et al., 2014).",
        "Therefore, when generating the sentiment lexicons we distinguished terms appearing in negated contexts (defined as text spans between a negation word and a punctuation mark) and affirmative (non-negated) contexts.",
        "The sentiment scores were then calculated separately for the two types of contexts.",
        "For example, the term good in affirmative contexts has a sentiment score of 1.2 whereas the same term in negated contexts has a score of -1.4.",
        "We built two lexicons, Yelp Restaurant Sentiment AffLex and Yelp Restaurant Sentiment NegLex, as described in (Kiritchenko et al., 2014).",
        "Similarly, we generated in-domain sentiment lexicons from the Amazon laptop reviews corpus.",
        "In addition, we employed existing out-of-domain sentiment lexicons: (1) large-coverage automatic tweet sentiment lexicons, Hashtag Sentiment lexicons and Sentiment140 lexicons (Kir- itchenko et al., 2014), and (2) three manually created sentiment lexicons, NRC Emotion Lexicon (Mohammad and Turney, 2010), Bing Liu's Lexicon (Hu and Liu, 2004), and the MPQA Subjectivity Lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005).",
        "Yelp Restaurant Word?Aspect Association Lexicon: The Yelp restaurant reviews corpus was also used to generate a lexicon of terms associated with the aspect categories of food, price, service, ambiance, and anecdotes.",
        "Each sentence of the corpus was labeled with zero, one, or more of the five aspect categories by our aspect category classification system (described in Section 5).",
        "Then, for each term w and each category c an association score was calculated as follows: score (w , c) = PMI (w , c)?",
        "PMI (w ,?c) (3) 2.3 Word Clusters Word clusters can provide an alternative representation of text, significantly reducing the sparsity of the token space.",
        "Using Brown clustering algorithm (Brown et al., 1992), we generated 1,000 word clusters from the Yelp restaurant reviews corpus.",
        "Additionally, we used publicly available 438 word clusters generated from 56 million English-language tweets (Owoputi et al., 2013).",
        "3 Subtask 1: Aspect Term Extraction The objective of this subtask is to detect aspect terms in sentences.",
        "We approached this problem using in-house entity-recognition software, very similar to the system used by de Bruijn et al. (2011) to detect medical concepts.",
        "First, sentences were tokenized to split away punctuation, and then the token sequence was tagged using a semi-Markov tagger (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004).",
        "The tagger had two possible tags: O for outside, and T for aspect term, where an aspect term could tag a phrase of up to 5 consecutive tokens.",
        "The tagger was trained using the structured Passive-Aggressive (PA) algorithm with a maximum step-size of C = 1 (Crammer et al., 2006).",
        "Our features can be divided into two categories: emission and transition features.",
        "Emission features couple the tag sequence y to the input w. Most of these work on the token level, and conjoin features of each token with the tag covering that token.",
        "If a token is the first or last token covered by a tag, then we produce a second copy of each of its features to indicate its special position.",
        "Let w i be the token being tagged; its token feature templates are: token-identity within a window (w i?2 .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "w i+2 ), lower-cased token-identity within a window (lc(w i?2 ) .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "lc(w i+2 )), and prefixes and suffixes of w i (up to 3 characters in length).",
        "There are only two phrase-level emission feature templates: the cased and uncased identity of the entire phrase covered by a tag, which allow the system to memorize complete terms such as, ?getting a table?",
        "or ?fish and chips.?",
        "Transition features couple tags with tags.",
        "Let the current tag be y j .",
        "Its transition feature templates are short n-grams of tag identities: y j ; y j , y j?1 ; and y j , y j?1 , y j?2 .",
        "During development, we experimented with the training algorithm, trying both PA and the simpler structured perceptron (Collins, 2002).",
        "We also added the lowercased back-off features.",
        "In Table 2, we re-test these design decisions on the test set, revealing that lower-cased back-off features made a strong contribution, while PA training was perhaps not as important.",
        "Our complete system achieved an F1-score of 80.19 on the restaurant domain and 68.57 on the laptop domain, ranking third among 24 teams in both.",

        "For example, in sentence ?The asian salad is barely eatable.?",
        "the aspect term asian salad is referred to with negative sentiment.",
        "There were defined four categories of sentiment: positive, negative, neutral, or conflict.",
        "The conflict category is assigned to cases where an aspect term is mentioned with both positive and negative sentiment.",
        "To address this multi-class classification prob-lem, we trained a linear SVM classifier using the LibSVM software (Chang and Lin, 2011).",
        "Sentences were first tokenized and parsed with the Stanford CoreNLP toolkits 2 to obtain part-of-speech (POS) tags and (collapsed) typed dependency parse trees (de Marneffe et al., 2006).",
        "Then, features were extracted from (1) the target term it-self; (2) its surface context, i.e., a window of n words surrounding the term; (3) the parse context, i.e., the nodes in the parse tree that are connected to the target term by at most three edges.",
        "Surface features: (1) unigrams (single words) and bigrams (2-word sequences) extracted from a term and its surface context; (2) context-target bigrams (i.e., bigrams formed by a word from the surface context and a word from the term itself).",

        "The idea behind the use of the parse features is that sometimes an aspect term is separated from its modifying sentiment phrase and the surface context is insufficient or even misleading for detecting sentiment expressed towards the aspect.",
        "For example, in sentence ?The food, though different from what we had last time, is actually great?",
        "the word great is much closer to the word food in the parse tree than in the surface form.",
