        "The Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) shared task aims at providing a unified framework for evaluating textual semantic similarity, ranging from exact semantic equivalence to completely unrelated texts.",
        "This is represented by the prediction of a similarity score between two sentences, drawn from a particular category of text, which ranges from 0 (different topics) to 5 (exactly equivalent) through six grades of semantic similarity (Agirre et al., 2013).",
        "This paper describes the NTNU submission to the SemEval 2014 STS shared task (Task 10).",
        "The approach is based on the lexical and distributional features of the baseline TakeLab system from the 2012 shared task ( ?",
        "Sari?c et al., 2012), but improves on it in three ways: by adding two new categories of features and by using a bagging regression model to predict similarity scores.",
        "The new feature categories added are based on soft cardinality and character n-grams, described ",
        "Licence de-tails:http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ in Section 2.",
        "The parameters of the two categories are optimised over several corpora and the features are combined through support vector regression (Section 3) to create the actual systems (Section 4).",
        "As Section 5 shows, the new measures give the baseline system a substantial boost, leading to very competitive results in the shared task evaluation.",
        "2 Feature Generation Methods The methods used for creating new features utilise soft cardinality and character n-grams.",
        "Soft cardinality (Jimenez et al., 2010) was used successfully for the STS task in previous SemEval editions (Jimenez et al., 2012a; Jimenez et al., 2013a).",
        "The NTNU systems utilise an ensemble of such 18 measures, based only on surface text information, which were extracted using soft cardinality with different similarity functions, as further described in Section 2.1.",
        "Section 2.2 then introduces the similarity measures based on character n-gram feature represen-tations, which proved themselves as the strongest features in the STS 2013 task (Marsi et al., 2013).",
        "The measures used here replace character n-gram features with cluster frequencies or vector values based on the n-gram collocational structure learned in an unsupervised manner from text data.",
        "A variety of n-gram feature representations were trained on subsets of Wikipedia and the best performing ones were used for the new measures, which are based on cosine similarity between the document vectors derived from each sentence in a given pair.",
        "2.1 Soft Cardinality Measures Soft cardinality resembles classical set cardinality as it is a method for counting the number of elements in a set, but differs from it in that similarities among elements are being considered for the ?soft counting?.",
        "The soft cardinality of a set of words 448 A = {a 1 , a 2 , .., a |A| } (a sentence) is defined by: |A| sim = |A| ?",
        "i=1 w a i ?",
        "|A| j=1 sim(a i , a j ) p (1) Where p is a parameter that controls the cardinal-ity's softness (p's default value is 1) and w a i are weights for each word, obtained through inverse document frequency (idf ) weighting.",
        "sim(a i , a j ) is a similarity function that compares two words a i and a j using the symmetrized Tversky's index (Tversky, 1977; Jimenez et al., 2013a) representing them as sets of 3-grams of characters.",
        "That is, a i = {a i,1 , a i,2 , ..., a i,|a i | } where a i,n is the n th character trigram in the word a i in A.",
        "Thus, the proposed word-to-word similarity is given by: sim(a i , a j )= |c| ?",

        "= 0.5, ?",
        "= 1 and bias = 0.",
        "The soft cardinalities of any pair of sentencesA, B andA?B can be obtained using Eq. 1.",
        "The soft cardinality of the intersection is approximated by |A?B| sim = |A| sim +|B| sim ?|A?B| sim .",
        "These four basic soft cardinalities are algebraically recombined to produce an extended set of 18 features as shown in Table 1.",
        "The featureSTS sim is a parameterized similarity function built by reusing at word level the symmetrized Tversky's index (Eq. 2), whose parameters are tuned from training data (as further described in Subsection 3.2).",
        "Although this method is based purely on string matching, the soft cardinality has been shown to be a very strong baseline for semantic textual comparison.",
        "The word-to-word similarity sim in Eq. 1 could be replaced by other similarity functions based on semantic networks or any distributional representation making this method able to capture more complex semantic relations among words.",
        "2.2 Sublexical Feature Representations We have created a set of similarity measures based on induced representations of character n-grams.",
        "The measures are based on similarity between STS sim (|A|?|A?B|) /|A| |A| (|A|?|A?B|) /|A?B| |B| |B| /|A?B| |A ?B| (|B|?|A?B|) /|B| |A ?B| (|B|?|A?B|) /|A?B| |A| ?",

        "The vector representations are induced in an unsupervised manner from large unannotated corpora using word clustering, topic learning and word representation learning methods.",
        "In this paper, three different methods have been used for creating the character n-gram feature representations: Brown Clusters (Brown et al., 1992), Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) topics (Deerwester et al., 1990), and log linear skip-gram models (Mikolov et al., 2013).",
        "The Brown clusters were trained using the implementation by Liang (2005), while the LSI topic vectors and log linear skip-gram representations were trained using the Gensim topic modelling framework ( ?",
        "Reh?u?rek and Sojka, 2010).",
        "In addition, tf-idf (Term-Frequency Inverse Document Frequency) weighting was used when training LSI topic models.",
        "We used a cosine distance measure between document vectors consisting of the centroid of the term representation vectors.",
        "For Brown clusters, the normalized term frequency vectors were used with the cluster IDs instead of the terms themselves.",
        "For LSI topic rep-resentations, the tf-idf weighted topic mixture for each term was used as the term representation.",
        "For the log linear skip-grams, the word representations were extracted from the model weight matrix.",
        "3 Feature and Parameter Optimisation The extracted features and the parameters for the two methods described in the previous section were optimised over several sets of training data.",

        "First, however, the training data had to be preprocessed.",
        "Thus, before extracting the idf weights and the soft cardinality features, all the texts shown in Table 2 were passed through the following four pre-processing steps: (i) tokenization and stop-word removal (pro- vided by NLTK, Bird et al.

        "Second, these seven parameters were set to their default values and the scores obtained from this function for each pair of sentences were compared to the gold standards in the training data using Pearson's correlation.",
        "The parameter search space was then explored iteratively using hill-climbing until reaching optimal Pearson's correlation.",
        "The criterion for assignment of training-test set pairs was by closeness of average character length.",
        "The optimal training parameters are shown in Table 3.",
        "3.3 Parameters for N-gram Feature Training The character n-gram feature representation vectors were trained while varying the parameters of n-gram size, cluster size, and term frequency cut-offs for all models.",
        "For the log linear skip-gram models, our intuition is that a larger skip-gram context is needed than the 5 or 10 wide skip-grams used to train word-based representations due to the smaller term vocabulary and dependency between adjacent n-grams, so instead we trained models using skip-gram widths of 25 or 50 terms.",
        "Term frequency cut-offs were set to limit the model size, but also potentially serve as a regularization on the resulting measure.",
        "In detail, the following sublexical representation measures are used: ?",
        "Log linear skip-gram representations of character 3- and 4-grams of size 1000 and 2000, respectively.",

        "3.4 Similarity Score Regression The final sentence pair similarity score is predicted by a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model with a Radial Basis (RBF) kernel (Vapnik et al., 1997).",
        "The model is trained on all the test data for the 2013 STS shared task combined with all the trial and test data of the 2012 STS shared task.",
        "The combined dataset hence consists of about 7,500 sentence pairs from nine different text cat-egories: five sets from the annotated data supplied to STS 2012, based on Microsoft Research Paraphrase and Video description corpora (MSR- par and MSvid), statistical machine translation system output (SMTeuroparl and SMTnews), and sense mappings between OntoNotes and WordNet (OnWN); and four sets from the STS 2013 test data: headlines (news headlines), SMT, OnWN, and FNWM (mappings of sense definitions from FrameNet and WordNet).",
        "The SVR model was trained as a bagged classi-fier, that is, for each run, 100 regression models were trained with 80% of the samples and features of the original training set drawn with replacement.",
        "The outputs of all models were then averaged into a final prediction.",
        "This bagged training procedure adds extra regularization, which can reduce the instability of prediction accuracy between different test data categories.",
        "The prediction pipeline was implemented with the Scikit-learn software framework (Pedregosa et al., 2011), and the SVR models were trained with the implementation's default parameters: cost penalty (C) 1.0, margin (\u000f) 0.1, and RBF precision (?)",
        "1/|featurecount|.",
        "We were unable to improve the performance over these defaults by cross validation parameter search unless the models were trained for specific text categories.",
        "Consequently no parameter optimization was performed during training of the final systems.",
        "4 Submitted Systems The three submitted systems consist of one using only the soft cardinality features described in Section 3.2 (NTNU-run1), one system using a baseline set of lexical measures and WordNet augmented similarity in addition to the new sublexical representation measures (NTNU-run2), and one (NTNU-run3) which combines the output from the other two systems by taking the mean of the two sets of predictions.",
