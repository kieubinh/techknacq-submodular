        "This paper describes our submission to Se-mEval2014 Task 9: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter.",
        "Our model is primarily a lexicon based one, augmented by some pre-processing, including detection of Multi-Word Expressions, negation propagation and hashtag expansion and by the use of pairwise semantic similarity at the tweet level.",
        "Feature extraction is repeated for sub-strings and contrasting sub-string features are used to better capture complex phenomena like sarcasm.",
        "The resulting supervised system, using a Naive Bayes model, achieved high performance in classifying entire tweets, ranking 7th on the main set and 2nd when applied to sarcastic tweets."

        "The analysis of the emotional content of text is relevant to numerous natural language processing (NLP), web and multi-modal dialogue applications.",
        "In recent years the increased popularity of social media and increased availability of relevant data has led to a focus of scientific efforts on the emotion expressed through social media, with Twitter being the most common subject.",
        "Sentiment analysis in Twitter is usually performed by combining techniques used for related tasks, like word-level (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004) and sentence-level (Turney and Littman, 2002; Turney and Littman, 2003) emotion extraction.",
        "Twitter however does present specific challenges: the breadth of possible content is virtually unlimited, the writing style is informal, the use of orthography and ",
        "grammar can be ?unconventional?",
        "and there are unique artifacts like hashtags.",
        "Computation sys-tems, like those submitted to SemEval 2013 task 2 (Nakov et al., 2013) mostly use bag-of-words models with specific features added to model emotion indicators like hashtags and emoticons (Davi- dov et al., 2010).",
        "This paper describes our submissions to SemEval 2014 task 9 (Rosenthal et al., 2014), which deals with sentiment analysis in twitter.",
        "The system is an expansion of our submission to the same task in 2013 (Malandrakis et al., 2013a), which used only token rating statistics as features.",
        "We expanded the system by using multiple lexica and more statistics, added steps to the pre-processing stage (including negation and multi-word expression handling), incorporated pairwise tweet-level semantic similarities as features and finally performed feature extraction on substrings and used the partial features as indicators of irony, sarcasm or humor.",
        "2 Model Description 2.1 Preprocessing POS-tagging / Tokenization was performed using the ARK NLP tweeter tagger (Owoputi et al., 2013), a Twitter-specific tagger.",
        "Negations were detected using the list from Christopher Potts?",
        "tutorial.",
        "All tokens up to the next punctuation were marked as negated.",
        "Hashtag expansion into word strings was performed using a combination of a word insertion Finite State Machine and a language model.",
        "A normalized perplexity threshold was used to detect if the output was a ?proper?",
        "English string and expansion was not performed if it was not.",
        "Multi-word Expressions (MWEs) were detected using the MIT jMWE library (Kulkarni and Finlayson, 2011).",
        "MWEs are non-compositional expressions (Sag et al., 2002), which should be 512 handled as a single token instead of attempting to reconstruct their meaning from their parts.",
        "2.2 Lexicon-based features The core of the system was formed by the lexicon-based features.",
        "We used a total of four lexica and some derivatives.",
        "2.2.1 Third party lexica We used three third party affective lexica.",
        "SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) provides continuous positive, negative and neutral ratings for each sense of every word in WordNet.",
        "We created two versions of SentiWordNet: one where ratings are averaged over all senses of a word (e.g., one ratings for ?good?)",
        "and one where ratings are averaged over lexeme-pos pairs (e.g., one rating for the adjective ?good?",
        "and one for the noun ?good?).",
        "NRC Hashtag (Mohammad et al., 2013) Sentiment Lexicon provides continuous polarity ratings for tokens, generated from a collection of tweets that had a positive or a negative word hashtag.",
        "Sentiment140 (Mohammad et al., 2013) Lexicon provides continuous polarity ratings for to-kens, generated from the sentiment140 corpus of 1.6 million tweets, with emoticons used as positive and negative labels.",
        "2.2.2 Emotiword: expansion and adaptation To create our own lexicon we used an automated algorithm of affective lexicon expansion based on the one presented in (Malandrakis et al., 2011; Malandrakis et al., 2013b), which in turn is an expansion of (Turney and Littman, 2002).",
        "We assume that the continuous (in [?1, 1]) va-lence, arousal and dominance ratings of any term t j can be represented as a linear combination of its semantic similarities d ij to a set of seed words w i and the known affective ratings of these words v(w i ), as follows: v?",
        "(t j ) = a 0 + N ?",
        "i=1 a i v(w i ) d ij , (1) where a i is the weight corresponding to seed word w i (that is estimated as described next).",
        "For the purposes of this work, d ij is the cosine similarity between context vectors computed over a corpus of 116 million web snippets (up to 1000 for each word in the Aspell spellchecker) collected using the Yahoo!",
        "search engine.",
        "Given the starting, manually annotated, lexicon Affective Norms for English Words (Bradley and Lang, 1999) we selected 600 out of the 1034 words contained in it to serve as seed words and all 1034 words to act as the training set and used Least Squares Estimation to estimate the weights a i .",
        "Seed word selection was performed by a simple heuristic: we want seed words to have extreme affective ratings (high absolute value) and the set to be close to balanced (sum of seed ratings equal to zero).",
        "The equation learned was used to generate ratings for any new terms.",
        "The lexicon created by this method is task-independent, since both the starting lexicon and the raw text corpus are task-independent.",
        "To create task-specific lexica we used corpus filtering on the 116 million sentences to select ones that match our domain, using either a normalized perplexity threshold (using a maximum likelihood trigram model created from the training set tweets) or a combination of pragmatic constraints (keywords with high mutual information with the task) and perplexity threshold (Malandrakis et al., 2014).",
        "Then we re-calculated semantic similarities on the filtered corpora.",
        "In total we created three lexica: a task-independent (base) version and two adapted versions (filtered by perplexity alone and filtered by combining pragmatics and perplexity), all containing valence, arousal and dominance token ratings.",
        "2.2.3 Statistics extraction The lexica provide up to 17 ratings for each token.",
        "To extract tweet-level features we used simple statistics and selection criteria.",
        "First, all token unigrams and bigrams contained in a tweet were collected.",
        "Some of these n-grams were selected based on a criterion: POS tags, whether a token is (part of) a MWE, is negated or was expanded from a hashtag.",
        "The criteria were applied separately to token unigrams and token bigrams (POS tags only applied to unigrams).",
        "Then ratings statistics were extracted from the selected n-grams: length (cardinality), min, max, max amplitude, sum, av-erage, range (max minus min), standard deviation and variance.",
        "We also created normalized versions by dividing by the same statistics calculated over all tokens, e.g., the maximum of adjectives over the maximum of all unigrams.",
        "The results of this process are features like ?maximum of Emotiword valence over unigram adjectives?",
        "and ?average of SentiWordNet objectivity among MWE bigrams?.",
        "513 2.3 Tweet-level similarity ratings Our lexicon was formed under the assumption that semantic similarity implies affective similar-ity, which should apply to larger lexical units like entire tweets.",
        "To estimate semantic similarity scores between tweets we used the publicly available TakeLab semantic similarity toolkit ( ?",
        "Sari?c et al., 2012) which is based on a submission to SemEval 2012 task 6 (Agirre et al., 2012).",
        "We used the data of SemEval 2012 task 6 to train three semantic similarity models corresponding to the three datasets of that task, plus an overall model.",
        "Using these models we created four similarity ratings between each tweet of interest and each tweet in the training set.",
        "These similarity ratings were used as features of the final model.",
        "2.4 Character features Capitalization features are frequencies and relative frequencies at the word and letter level, extracted from all words that either start with a capital letter, have a capital letter in them (but the first letter is non-capital) or are in all capital letters.",
        "Punctuation features are frequencies, relative frequencies and punctuation unigrams.",
        "Character repetition features are frequencies, relative frequencies and longest string statistics of words containing a repetition of the same letter.",
        "Emoticon features are frequencies, relative fre-quencies, and emoticon unigrams.",
        "2.5 Contrast features Cognitive Dissonance is an important phenomenon associated with complex linguistic cases like sarcasm, irony and humor (Reyes et al., 2012).",
        "To estimate it we used a simple approach, inspired by one-liner joke detection: we assumed that the final few tokens of each tweet (the ?suffix?)",
        "contrast the rest of the tweet (the ?prefix?)",
        "and created split versions of the tweet where the last N tokens are the suffix and all other tokens are the prefix, for N = 2 and N = 3.",
        "We repeated the feature extraction process for all features mentioned above (except for the semantic similarity features) for the prefix and suffix, nearly tripling the total number of features.",
        "2.6 Feature selection and Training The extraction process lead to tens of thousands of candidate features, so we performed forward stepwise feature selection using a correlation crite-Table 1: Performance and rank achieved by our submission for all datasets of subtasks A and B. task dataset avg.",

        "The model chosen is a Naive Bayes tree, a tree with Naive Bayes classifiers on each leaf.",
        "The motivation comes from considering this a two stage problem: subjectivity detection and polarity classification, making a hierarchical model a natural choice.",
