        "A general system for semantic similarity aiming at being applicable in such a broad scope has to be able to adapt to the use case at hand, because different use cases might, for example, require different similarity scales: For one application, two texts dealing roughly with the same topic should get a high similarity score, whereas for another application being able to distinguish between subtle differences in meaning might be important.",
        "The three SemEval-2014 shared tasks focussing on semantic similarity (cf.",
        "Sections 3, 4 and 5 for more detailed task descriptions) provide a rich testbed for such a general system, as the individual tasks and subtasks have slightly different objectives.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, we describe SemantiKLUE, a general system for measuring semantic similarity between texts that we built based on our experience from participating in the *SEM 2013 shared task on ?Semantic Textual Similarity?",
        "(Greiner et al., 2013).",
        "2 System Description SemantiKLUE operates in two stages.",
        "In the first, unsupervised stage, a number of similarity measures are computed.",
        "Those measures are the same for all tasks and range from simple heuristics to distributional approaches to resource-heavy methods based on WordNet and dependency structures.",
        "The idea is to have a variety of similarity measures that can capture small differences in meaning as well as broad thematical similarities.",
        "In the second, supervised stage, all similarity measures obtained in this way are passed to a support vector regression learner that is trained on the available gold standard data in order to obtain a final semantic similarity score.",
        "This way, the proper similarity scale for a given task can be learned.",
        "The few remaining outliers in the predictions for new text pairs are cut 532 off to fit the interval required by the task definition ([0,4] or [0,5]).",
        "Our submissions for the individual tasks were created using incomplete versions from different developmental stages of the system.",
        "In the following sections we describe the current version of the complete system for which we also report comparable results for all tasks (cf.",
        "Sections 3?",
        "5).",
        "The whole system is implemented in Python.",
        "2.1 Preprocessing We use Stanford CoreNLP 1 for part-of-speech tag-ging, lemmatizing and parsing the input texts.",
        "We utilize the CCprocessed variant of the Stanford Dependencies (collapsed dependencies with propagation of conjunct dependencies; de Marneffe and Manning (2008, 13?15)) to create a graph representation of the texts using the NetworkX 2 (Hagberg et al., 2008) module.",
        "All the similarity measures described below are computed on the basis of that graph representation.",
        "It is important to keep in mind that by basing all computations on the Stanford Dependencies model we effectively ignore most of the prepositions when using measures that work on tokens.",
        "3 For some tasks, we perform some additional task-specific preprocessing steps prior to parsing, cf. task descriptions below.",
        "2.2 Simple Measures We use four simple heuristic similarity measures that need very little preprocessing.",
        "The first two are word form overlap and lemma overlap between the two texts.",
        "We take the sets of word form to-kens/lemmatized tokens in text A and text B and calculate the Jaccard coefficient: overlap = |A?B| |A?B| .",
        "The third is a heuristic for the difference in text length that was used by Gale and Church (1993) as a similarity measure for aligning sentences: z i = d i ?",
        "d , where d i = b i ?",
        "?",
        "N j=1 b j ?",
        "N j=1 a j a i .",
        "For each of the N text pairs we calculate the difference d i between the observed length of text B and 1http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.",

        "By dividing that difference d i by the standard deviation of all those differences, we obtain our heuristic z i .",
        "The fourth is a binary feature expressing whether the two texts differ in their use of negation.",
        "We check if one of the texts contains any of the lemmata no, not or none and the other doesn't.",
        "That feature is motivated by the comparatively large number of sentences in the SICK dataset (Marelli et al., 2014b) that mainly differ in their use of nega-tion, e. g. sentence pair 42 in the training data that has a gold similarity score of 3.4: ?",
        "Two people are kickboxing and spectators are watching ?",
        "Two people are kickboxing and spectators are not watching 2.3 Measures Based on Distributional Document Similarity We obtain document similarity scores from two large-vocabulary distributional semantic models (DSMs).",
        "The first model is based on a 10-billion word Web corpus consisting of Wackypedia and ukWaC (Baroni et al., 2009), UMBC WebBase (Han et al., 2013), and UKCOW 2012 (Sch?fer and Bild-hauer, 2012).",
        "Target terms and feature terms are POS-disambiguated lemmata.",
        "4 We use parameters suggested by recent evaluation experiments: co-occurrence counts in a symmetric 4-word win-dow, the most frequent 30,000 lexical words as features, log-likelihood scores with an additional log-transformation, and SVD dimensionality reduction of L2-normalized vectors to 1000 latent dimensions.",
        "This model provides distributional representations for 150,000 POS-disambiguated lemmata as target terms.",
        "The second model was derived from the second release of the Google Books N-Grams database (Lin et al., 2012), using the dependency pairs provided in this version.",
        "Target and feature terms are case-folded word forms; co-occurrence ounts are based on direct syntactic relations.",
        "Here, the most frequent 50,000 word forms were used as features.",
        "All other parameters are identical to the first DSM.",
        "This model provides distributional representations for 250,000 word forms.",
        "We compute bag-of-words centroid vectors for each text as suggested by (Sch√ºtze, 1998).",
        "For each 4 e.g. can_N for the noun can 533 text pair and DSM, we calculate the cosine similarity between the two centroid vectors as a measure of their semantic similarity.",
        "We also determine the number of unknown words in both texts according to both DSMs as additional features.",
        "2.4 Alignment-based Measures We also use features based on word-level similarity.",
        "We separately compute similarities between words using state-of-the-art WordNet similarity measures and the two distributional semantic models described above.",
        "The words from both texts are then aligned using those similarity scores to maximize the similarity total.",
        "We use two types of alignment: One-to-one alignment where some words in the longer text remain unaligned and one-to-many alignment where all words are aligned.",
        "The one-to-many alignment is based on the one-to-one alignment and aligns each previously unaligned word in the longer text to the most similar word in the shorter text.",
        "The discussion of the alignment algorithm is based on the former case.",
        "2.4.1 Alignment via Maximum Weight Matching We opt for a graphical solution to the alignment problem.",
        "The similarities between the words from both texts can be modelled as a bipartite graph in which every word from text A is a vertice on the left-hand side of the graph and every word from text B a vertex on the right-hand side.",
        "Weighted edges connect every word from text A to every word from text B. The weight of an edge corresponds to the similarity between the two words it connects.",
        "In order to obtain an optimal one-to-one alignment we have to select edges in such a way that no two edges share a common vertice and that the sum of the edge weights is maximized.",
        "That corresponds to the problem of finding the maximum weight matching in the graph.",
        "SemantiKLUE utilizes the NetworkX implementation of Galil's (1986) algorithms for finding that maximum weight matching.",
        "Figure 1 visualizes the one-to-one alignment between two sentences.",
        "For the one-to-many align-ment, the previously unaligned words are aligned as indicated by the dashed lines.",
        "2.4.2 Measures Based on Distributional Word Similarities For each of the two DSMs described in Section 2.3 we compute the best one-to-one and the best one-A woman is using a machine made for sewing A woman is sewing with a machine Figure 1: Alignment between a sentence pair from the SICK data set.",
        "to-many alignment using the cosine similarity between two words as edge weight.",
        "For each of those two alignments we compute the following two similarity measures: I) the arithmetic mean of the cosines between all the aligned words from text A and text B and II) the arithmetic mean ignoring identical word pairs.",
        "In addition to those eight measures, we use the lemma-based DSM for computing the distribution of cosines between lemma pairs.",
        "For both align-ments, we categorize the cosines between aligned lemma pairs into five heuristically determined intervals ([0.2,0.35), [0.35,0.5), [0.5,0.7), [0.7,0.999), [0.999,1.0]) 5 and use the proportions as features.",
        "Intuitively, the top bins correspond to links between identical words, paradigmatically related words and topically related words.",
        "All in all, we use a total of 18 features computed from the DSM-based alignments.",
        "2.4.3 Measures Based on WordNet We utilize two state-of-the-art (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006) WordNet similarity measures for creating alignments: Leacock and Chodorow's (1998) normalized path length and Lin's (1998) universal similarity measure.",
        "For both of those similarity measures we compute the best one-to-one and the best one-to-many alignment.",
        "For each alignment we compute the following two similarity measures: I) the arithmetic mean of the similarities between the aligned words from text A and text B and II) the arithmetic mean ignoring identical word pairs.",
        "5 Values in the interval [0.0,0.2) are discarded as they would be collinear with the other features.",
        "534 We also include the number of unknown words in both texts according to WordNet as additional features.",
        "2.5 Measures Using the Dependency Structure We expect that the information encoded in the dependency structure of the texts can be beneficial in determining the semantic similarity between them.",
        "Therefore, we use three heuristics for measuring similarity on the level of syntactic dependencies.",
        "The first simply measures the overlap of dependency relation labels between the two texts (cf. Section 2.2).",
        "The second utilizes the fact that the Stanford Dependencies are organized in a hierarchy (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008, 11?12) to compute Leacock and Chodorow's normalized path lengths between individual dependency relations.",
        "That measure for the similarity between dependency relations is then used to determine the best one-to-one alignment between dependency relations from text A and text B and to compute the arithmetic mean of the similarities between the aligned dependency relations.",
        "The third heuristic gives an indication of the quality of the one-to-one alignment and can be used to distinguish texts that contain the same words in different syntactic structures.",
        "It uses the one-to-one alignment created with similarity scores from the lemma-based DSM (cf.",
        "Section 2.4.2) to compute the average overlap of neighbors for all aligned word pairs.",
        "The overlap of neighbors is determined by computing the Jaccard coefficient of sets N A and N B .",
        "Set N A contains all words from text B that are aligned to words from text A that are connected to the target word via a single dependency relation.",
        "N B contains all words from text B that are connected to the word aligned to the target word in text A via a single dependency relation.",
        "2.6 Experimental Features As an experiment, we included features from a commercial text clustering software that is currently being developed by our team (Greiner and Evert, in preparation).",
        "We used this tool ?",
        "which combines ideas from Latent Semantic Indexing and distributional semantics with multiple clustering steps ?",
        "as a black box.",
        "We loaded all training, development and test items for a given task into the system and applied the clustering algorithm.",
        "However, we did not make use of the resulting topic clusters.",
        "Instead, we computed cosine similarities for each pair (s 1 ,s 2 ) of sentences (or other textual units) based on the internal representation.",
        "In addition, we computed the average neighbour rank of the two sentences, based on the rank of s 2 among the nearest neighbours of s 1 and vice versa.",
        "Since these features are generated from the task data themselves, they should adapt automatically to the range of meaning differences present in a given data set.",
        "2.7 Machine Learning Using all the features described above, we have a total of 39 individual features that measure semantic similarity between two texts (cf.",
        "Sections 2.2 to 2.5) and two experimental features (cf.",
        "Section 2.6).",
        "In order to obtain a single similarity score, we use the scikit-learn 6 (Pedregosa et al., 2011) implementation of support vector regression.",
        "In our cross-validation experiments we got the best results with an RBF kernel of degree 2 and a penaltyC= 0.7, so those are the parameters we use in our experiments.",
        "The SemEval-2014 Task 1 also includes a classification subtask for which we use the same 39+2 features for training a support vector classifier.",
        "Cross-validation suggests that the best parameter setting is a polynomial kernel of degree 2 and a penalty C = 2.5.",
        "3 SemEval-2014 Task 1 3.1 Task Description The focus of the shared task on ?Evaluation of compositional distributional semantic models on full sentences through semantic relatedness and textual entailment?",
        "(Marelli et al., 2014a) lies on the compositional nature of sentence semantics.",
        "By using a specially created data set (Marelli et al., 2014b) that tries to avoid multiword expressions and other idiomatic features of language outside the scope of compositional semantics, it provides a testbed for systems implementing compositional variants of distributional semantics.",
        "There is also an additional subtask for detecting the entailment relation (entail- ment, neutral, contradiction) between to sentences.",
        "Although SemantiKLUE lacks a truly sophisticated component for dealing with compositional semantics (besides trying to incorporate the dependency structure of the texts), the system takes the seventh place in the official ranking by Pearson correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.780 6http://scikit-learn.org/ 535 (best of 17 systems: 0.828).",

        "As the individual data sets are not very similar to each other, we tried to come up with a good subset of the available training data for each data set.",
        "In doing so, we were moderately successful as the results in Table 3 show.",

        "If we stick to using the same training data for all test data sets and optimize the subset of the training data we use, we achieve a slightly better result than our submitted run (the optimal subset consists of the FNWN, headlines, MSRpar, MSRvid and OnWN data sets).",
