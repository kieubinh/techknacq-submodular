        "This document describes the senti.ue system and how it was used for participation in SemEval-2014 Task 9 challenge.",
        "Our system is an evolution of our prior work, also used in last year's edition of Sentiment Analysis in Twitter.",
        "This system maintains a supervised machine learning approach to classify the tweet overall sentiment, but with a change in the used features and the algorithm.",
        "We use a restricted set of 47 features in subtask B and 31 features in subtask A.",
        "In the constrained mode, and for the five data sources, senti.ue achieved a score between 78,72 and 84,05 in subtask A, and a score between 55,31 and 71,39 in subtask B. For the unconstrained mode, our score was slightly below, except for one case in subtask A."

        "Evora's Computer Science Department in SemEval-2014 Task 9: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter (Rosenthal et al., 2014).",
        "SemEval-2014 Task 9 has an expression-level (subtask A) and a message-level (subtask B) polarity classification challenges.",
        "The first subtask aims to determine whether a word (or phrase) is posi-tive, negative or neutral, within the textual context in which it appears.",
        "The second subtask concerns the classification of the overall text polarity, which corresponds to automatically detecting the sentiment expressed in a Twitter message.",
        "In both sub-tasks, systems can operate in constrained or unconstrained mode.",
        "Constrained means that learn-This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "License details: http: //creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ ing is based only on provided training texts, with the possible aid of static resources such as lexicons.",
        "Extra tweets or additional annotated documents for training are permitted only in unconstrained mode.",
        "The system we used to respond to this challenge is called senti.ue, and follows on from our previous work on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Sentiment Analysis (SA).",
        "We developed work in automatic reputation assessment, using a Machine Learning (ML) based classifier for comments with impact on a particular target entity (Saias, 2013).",
        "We also participated in the previous edition of SemEval SA task, where we have implemented the basis for the current system.",
        "In last year's solution (Saias and Fernandes, 2013), we treated both subtasks using the same method (except the training set).",
        "We have updated the method for subtask A, now considering also the text around the area to classify, by dedicating new features to those preceding and following tweet parts.",
        "Text overall sentiment classification is the core objective of our system, and is performed, as before, with a supervised machine learning technique.",
        "For subtask B, we fixed some implementation issues in the previous version, and we went from 22 to 53 features, explained in Section 3.",
        "2 Related Work The popularity of social networks and microblog-ging facilitated the sharing of opinions.",
        "To know whether people are satisfied or not with a particular brand or product is of great interest to marketing companies.",
        "Much work has appeared in SA, trying to capture valuable information in expressions of contentment or discontentment.",
        "Important international scientific events, NLP re-lated, include SA challenges and workshops.",
        "This was the case in SemEval-2013, whose task 2 (Wil- son et al., 2013) required sentiment analysis of Twitter and SMS text messages.",
        "Being the pre-546 decessor task of the challenge for which this work was developed, it is similar to this year's Task 9.",
        "The participating systems achieved better results in contextual polarity subtask (A) than those obtained for the overall message polarity subtask (B).",
        "In that edition, the best results were obtained by systems in constrained mode.",
        "The most common method was supervised ML with features that can be related to text words, syntactic function, discourse elements relation, internet slang and sym-bols, or clues from sentiment lexicons.",
        "In that task, the NRC-Canada system (Mohammad et al., 2013) obtained the best performance, achieving an F1 of 88.9% in subtask A and 69% in subtask B. That system used one SVM classifier for each subtask, together with text surface based fea-tures, features associated with manually created and automatically generated sentiment lexicons, and n-gram features.",
        "Other systems with good results in that task were GU-MLT-LT (G?unther and Furrer, 2013) and AVAYA (Becker et al., 2013).",
        "The first was implemented in the Python language.",
        "It includes features for: text tokens after normalization, stems, word clusters, and two values for the accumulated positive and accumulated negative SentiWordNet (Baccianella et al., 2010) scores, considering negation.",
        "Its machine learning classifier is based on linear models with stochastic gradient descent.",
        "The approach taken in the AVAYA system centers on training high-dimensional, linear classifiers with a combination of lexical and syntactic features.",
        "This system uses Bag-of-Words features, with negation represented in word suffix, and including not only the raw word forms but also combinations with lemmas and PoS tags.",
        "Then, word polarity features are added, using the MPQA lexicon (Wiebe et al., 2005), as well as syntactic dependency and PoS tag features.",
        "Other features consider emoticons, capitalization, character repetition, and emphasis characters, such as asterisks and dashes.",
        "The resulting model was trained with the LIBLINEAR (Fan et al., 2008) classification library.",
        "Another NLP task very close to SA is polarity classification on the reputation of an entity.",
        "Here, instead the sentiment in the perspective of the opinion holder, the goal is to detect the impact of this particular opinion on some entity's reputation.",
        "The diue system (Saias, 2013) uses a supervised ML approach for reputation polarity classification, including Bag-of-Words and a limited set of features based on sentiment lexicons and superficial text analysis.",
        "3 Method This work follows on from our previous participation in SemEval-2013 SA task, where we have devoted greater effort to subtask B. We start by explaining our current approach for this subtask, and then we describe how such classifier is also used in subtask A.",
        "3.1 Message Polarity Classification The senti.ue system maintains a supervised machine learning approach to perform the overall sentiment classification.",
        "As before, Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK 1 ) are used for text processing and ML feature extraction.",
        "The first step was to obtain the tweet content and forming the instances of the training set.",
        "During the download phase, several tweets were not found.",
        "In constrained mode, we got only 7352 instances available for training.",
        "Tweet preprocessing includes tokenization, which is punctuation and white space based, negation de-tection, and lemmatization, through NLTK class WordNetLemmatizer.",
        "After that, the system runs the ML component.",
        "Instead of the solution we used in 2013, with two differently configured classifiers in a pipeline, we chose to use a single classifier, which this year is based on SciKit-Learn 2 , and to increase the number of features that are extracted to represent each instance.",
        "The classification algorithm was Support Vector Machines (SVM), using SVC 3 class, with a linear kernel and 10 ?5 tolerance for stopping criterion.",
        "SVC class implementation is based on libsvm (Chang and Lin, 2011), and uses one-against-one approach for multi-class classification.",
        "From each instance, the system extracts the 47 features in Figure 1.",
        "The first two features represent the index of the first polarized token.",
        "The following represent the repeated occurrence of a question mark, and the existence of a token with negation (not, never).",
        "Then there are two features that indicate whether there is negation before positive or negative words.",
        "The following 8 fea-1 Python based platform with resources and programming libraries suitable for linguistic processing (Bird, 2006).",
        "2 Open source tool for Machine Learning in Python - http://scikit-learn.org/ 3 http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#svm-classification 547 tures indicate whether there are positive or negative terms, just after, or near, a question mark or an exclamation mark.",
        "We build a table with words or phrases marked as positive or negative in subtask A data.",
        "Using this resource, 4 features test the presence and the count of word n-grams marked as positive or negative.",
        "Then the TA.alike features represent the same, but after lemmatization and synonym verification.",
        "To find the synonyms of a term, we used the WordNet (Princeton Univer-sity, 2010) resource.",
        "The probability of each word belonging to a class was calculated.",
        "There are 3 features avgProbWordOn, one per class, that represent the average of this probability for each instance words.",
        "Next 3 features represent the same, but focusing only on the last 5 words of each text.",
        "Then we have 6 ProbLog2Prob features, representing the average of P ?",
        "log 2 (P ), for all words, or only the latest 5 words, for all classes.",
        "P is the probability of the word belonging to one class.",
        "One feature cumulates the token polarity values, according to SentiWordNet.",
        "The final 12 features are based on sentiment lexicons: AFINN (Nielsen, 2011), Bing Liu (Liu et al., 2005), MPQA, and a custom polarity table with some manually entered entries.",
        "For each resource, we count the instance tokens with negative and positive polarity, and create a feature direction, having the value 1 if countTokens.pos>countTokens.neg, -1 if count-Tokens.pos<countTokens.neg, or 0.",
        "For the unconstrained mode, the only difference is the use of more instances for the training set, with 3296 short texts obtained from SemEval-2014 Task 4 data 4 , about laptops and restaurants.",
        "3.2 Contextual Polarity Disambiguation In this subtask, the download phase fetched only 6506 tweets.",
        "These instances have boundaries marking the substring to classify.",
        "Our system starts by splitting the document into text segments: fullText, leftText, rightText, sentenceText, chosenText.",
        "The first corresponds to the entire tweet.",
        "The following represent the text before and the text after the chosen text.",
        "Then we have the sentence where the chosen text is, and finally the text segment that systems must classify.",
        "The preprocessing described before is then applied to each of these text segments.",
        "For each instance, the system generates the 31 features listed in Figure 2.",

        "Without a deep linguistic anal-ysis, our system achieved a reasonable result in subtask B. The evaluation of our solution, in both subtasks, shows an appreciable improvement, by 10% or more, when compared to our results in 2013.",
        "We believe that the additional training instances used in unconstrained mode and subtask B, about laptops and restaurants, have a writing style different from most of the test set documents.",
        "And perhaps this is the cause for lower score in the unconstrained mode, something that happened also with many systems in the past edition (Wilson et al., 2013).",
        "This time, we implemented the contextual polarity solution based on the subtask B classifier.",
        "Given the results, we intend to do, in the near future, a 549 new iteration of our system where the overall classifier will depend on (or receive features from) the current subtask A classifier.",
        "It seems to us that senti.ue feature engineering can be improved, maintaining this line of development.",
        "Once stabilized, the introduction of named entity recognition and a richer linguistic analysis will help to identify the sentiment target entities, as the ultimate goal for this system.",
