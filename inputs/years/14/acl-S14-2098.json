        "Using a meta-learning framework, we experiment with traditional knowledge-based metrics, as well as novel corpus-based measures based on deep learning paradigms, paired with varying degrees of context expansion.",

        "Semantic textual similarity is one of the key components behind a multitude of natural language processing applications, such as information retrieval (Salton and Lesk, 1971), relevance feedback and text classification (Rocchio, 1971), word sense disambiguation (Lesk, 1986; Sch√ºtze, 1998), summarization (Salton et al., 1997; Lin and Hovy, 2003), automatic evaluation of machine translation (Papineni et al., 2002), plagiarism detection (Nawab et al., 2011), and more.",
        "To date, semantic similarity research has primarily focused on comparing text snippets of similar length (see the semantic textual similarity tasks organized during *Sem 2013 (Agirre et al., 2013) and SemEval 2012 (Agirre et al., 2012)).",
        "Yet, as new challenges emerge, such as augmenting a knowledge-base with textual evidence, assessing similarity across different context granularities is gaining traction.",
        "The SemEval Cross-level semantic similarity task is aimed at this latter scenario, and is described in more details in the task paper (Jurgens et al., 2014).",
        "?",
        "2 Related Work Over the past years, the research community has focused on computing semantic relatedness using methods that are either knowledge-based or corpus-based.",
        "Knowledge-based methods derive a measure of relatedness by utilizing lexical resources and ontologies such as WordNet (Miller, 1995) or Roget (Rog, 1995) to measure definitional overlap, term distance within a graphical taxonomy, or term depth in the taxonomy as a measure of specificity.",
        "There are many knowledge-based measures that were proposed in the past, e.g., (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998; Lesk, 1986; Resnik, 1995; Jiang and Conrath, 1997; Lin, 1998; Jarmasz and Szpakowicz, 2003; Hughes and Ramage, 2007).",
        "On the other side, corpus-based measures such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007), Salient Semantic Analysis (SSA) (Hassan and Mihalcea, 2011), Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) (Church and Hanks, 1990), PMI-IR (Turney, 2001), Second Order PMI (Islam and Inkpen, 2006), Hyperspace Analogues to Language (Burgess et al., 1998) and distributional similarity (Lin, 1998) employ probabilistic approaches to decode the semantics of words.",
        "They consist of unsupervised methods that utilize the contextual information and patterns observed in raw text to build semantic profiles of words.",
        "Unlike knowledge-based methods, which suffer from limited coverage, corpus-based measures are able to induce the similarity between any two words, as long as they appear in the corpus used for training.",
        "3 System Description 3.1 Generic Features Our system employs both knowledge and corpus-based measures as detailed below.",
        "560 Knowledge-based features Knowledge-based metrics were shown to provide high correlation scores with the goldstandard in text similarity tasks (Agirre et al., 2012; Agirre et al., 2013).",
        "We used three WordNet-based similarity measures that employ information content.",
        "We chose these metrics because they are able to incorporate external information derived from a large corpus: Resnik (Resnik, 1995) (RES), Lin (Lin, 1998) (LIN ), and Jiang & Conrath (Jiang and Conrath, 1997) (JCN ).",
        "Corpus based features Our corpus based features are derived from a deep learning vector space model that is able to ?understand?",
        "word meaning without human input.",
        "Distributed word embeddings are learned using a skip-gram recurrent neural net architecture running over a large raw corpus (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Mikolov et al., 2013a).",
        "A primary advantage of such a model is that, by breaking away from the typical n-gram model that sees individual units with no relationship to each other, it is able to generalize and produce word vectors that are similar for related words, thus encoding linguistic regularities and patterns (Mikolov et al., 2013b).",
        "For example, vec(Madrid)-vec(Spain)+vec(France) is closer to vec(Paris) than any other word vector (Mikolov et al., 2013a).",
        "We used the pre-trained Google News word2vec model (WTV ) built over a 100 billion words corpus, and containing 3 million 300-dimension vectors for words and phrases.",
        "The model is distributed with the word2vec toolkit.",
        "1 Since the methods outlined above provide similarity scores at the sense or word level, we derive text level metrics by employing two methods.",
        "VectorSum.",
        "We add the vectors corresponding to the non-stopwords tokens in bag of words (BOW) A and B, resulting in vectors V A and V B , respectively.",
        "The assumption is that these vectors are able to capture the semantic meaning associated with the contexts, enabling us to gauge their relatedness using cosine similarity.",
        "Align.",
        "Given two BOW A and B as input, we compare them using a word-alignment-based similarity measure (Mihalcea et al., 2006).",
        "We calculate the pairwise similarity between the words in A and B, and match each word in A with its most similar counterpart in B. For corpus-based fea-1 https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/ tures, the similarity measure represents the average over these scores, while for knowledge-based measures, we consider the top 40% ranking pairs.",
        "We use the DKPro Similarity package (B?ar et al., 2013) to compute knowledge-based metrics, and the word2vec implementation from the Gen-sim toolkit (Rehurek and Sojka, 2010).",
        "3.2 Feature Variations Since our system participated in all four lexical levels evaluations, we describe below the modifications pertaining to each.",
        "word2sense.",
        "At the word2sense level, we employ both knowledge and corpus-based features.",
        "Since the information available in each pair is extremely limited (only a word and a sense key) we infuse contextual information by drawing on WordNet (Miller, 1995).",
        "In WordNet, the sense of each word is encapsulated in a uniquely identifiable synset, consisting of the definition (gloss), usage examples and its synonyms.",
        "We can derive three variations (where the word and sense components are represented by BOW A and B, respec-tively): a) no expansion (A={word}, B={sense}), b) expand right (R) (A={word}, B={sense gloss & example}), c) expand left (L) & right (R) (A={word glosses & examples}, B={sense gloss & example}).",
        "After applying the Align method, we obtain measures JNC, LIN , RES and WTV 1; VectorSum results in WTV 2. phrase2word.",
        "As this lexical level also suffers from low context, we adapt the above vari-ations, where the phrase and word components are represented by BOW A and BOW B, respectively.",
        "Thus, we have: a) no expansion (A={phrase}, B={word}), b) expand R (A={phrase}, B={word glosses and examples}), c) expand L & R (A={phrase glosses & exam-ples}, B={word glosses and examples}).",
        "We extract the same measures as for word2sense.",
        "sentence2phrase.",
        "For this variation, we use only corpus based measures; BOW A represents the sentence component, B, the phrase.",
        "Since there is sufficient context available, we follow the no expansion variation, and obtain metrics WTV 1 (by applying Align) and WTV 2 (using VectorSum).",
        "paragraph2sentence.",
        "At this level, due to the long context that entails one-to-many mappings between the words in the sentence and those in the paragraph, we use a text clustering technique prior to calculating the features?",
        "weights.",
        "561 a) no clustering.",
        "We use only corpus based mea-sures, where the paragraph represents BOW A, and the sentence represents BOW B. Then we apply Align and VectorSum, resulting in WTV 1 and WTV 2, respectively.",
        "b) paragraph centroids extraction.",
        "Since the longer text contains more information compared to the shorter one, we extract k topic vectors after K-means clustering the left context.",
        "2 These centroids are able to model topics permeating across sentences, and by comparing them with the word vectors pertaining to the short text, we seek to capture how much of the information is covered in the shorter text.",
        "Each word is paired with the centroid that it is closest to, and the average is computed over these scores, resulting in WTV 3. c) sentence centroids extraction.",
        "Under a different scenario, assuming that one sentence covers only a few strongly expressed topics, unlike a paragraph that may digress and introduce unrelated noise, we apply clustering on the short text.",
        "The centroids thus obtained are able to capture the essence of the sentence, so when compared to every word in the paragraph, we can gauge how much of the short text is reflected in the longer one.",
        "Each centroid is paired with the word that it is most similar to, and we average these scores, thus obtaining WTV 4.",
        "In a way, methods b) and c) provide a macro, respectively micro view of how the topics are reflected across the two spans of text.",
        "3.3 Meta-learning The measures of similarity described above provide a single score per each long text short text pair in the training and test data.",
        "These scores then become features for a meta-learner, which is able to optimize their impact on the prediction process.",
        "We experimented with multiple regression algorithms by conducting 10 fold cross-validation on the training data.",
        "The strongest performer across all lexical levels was Gaussian processes with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel.",
        "Gaussian processes regression is an efficient probabilistic prediction framework that assumes a Gaussian process prior on the unobservable (latent) functions and a likelihood function that accounts for noise.",
        "An individual classifier 3 was trained for each lexical level and applied to the test data sets.",
        "2 Implementation provided in the Scikit library (Pedregosa et al., 2011), where k is set to 3.",
        "3 Implementation available in the WEKA machine learning software (Hall et al., 2009) using the default parameters.",
        "4 Evaluations & Discussion Our system participated in all cross-level subtasks under the name SimCompass, competing with 37 other systems developed by 20 teams.",
        "Figure 1 highlights the Pearson correlations at the four lexical levels between the gold standard and each similarity measure introduced in Section 3, as well as the predictions ensuing as a result of meta-learning.",
        "The left and right histograms in each subfigure present the scores obtained on the train and test data, respectively.",
        "In the case of word2sense train data, we notice that expanding the context provides additional information and improves the correlation results.",
        "For corpus-based measures, the correlations are stronger when the expansion involves only the right side of the tuple, namely the sense.",
        "We notice an increase of 0.04 correlation points for WTV1 and 0.09 for WTV2.",
        "As soon as the word is expanded as well, the context incorporates too much noise, and the correlation levels drop.",
        "In the case of knowledge-based measures, expanding the context does not seem to impact the results.",
        "However, these trends do not carry out to the test data, where the corpus-based features without expansion reach a correlation higher than 0.3, while the knowledge-based features score significantly lower (by 0.16).",
        "Once all these measures are used as features in a meta learner (All) using Gaussian processes regression (GP), the correlation increases over the level attained by the best performing individual feature, reaching 0.45 on the train data and 0.36 on the test data.",
        "SimCompass ranks second in this subtask's evaluations, falling short of the leading system by 0.025 correlation points.",
        "Turning now to the phrase2word subfigure, we notice that the context already carries sufficient information, and expanding it causes the performance to drop (the more extensive the expan-sion, the steeper the drop).",
        "Unlike the scenario encountered for word2sense, the trend observed here on the training data also gets mirrored in the test data.",
        "Same as before, knowledge-based measures have a significantly lower performance, but deep learning-based features based on word2vec (WTV) only show a correlation variation by at most 0.05, proving their robustness.",
        "Leveraging all the features in a meta-learning framework enables the system to predict stronger scores for both the train and the test data (0.48 and 0.42, respec-tively).",
        "Actually, for this variation, SimCompass 562 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 w o rd 2s en se Train Test 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 BL JNC LIN RES W TV 1 W TV 2 G P JN C LIN RES W TV 1 W TV 2 G P ph ra se 2w or d No expansion Expansion R Expansion L&R All 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 s e n te n ce 2p hr as e Train Test BL WTV 1 W TV 2 W TV 3 W TV 4 G P W TV 1 W TV 2 W TV 3 W TV 4 G P 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 pa ra gr ap h2 se nt en ce Figure 1: Pearson correlation of individual measures on the train and test data sets.",
        "As these measures become features in a regression algorithm (GP), prediction correlations are included as well.",
        "BL represents the baseline computed by the organizers.",
        "obtains the highest score among all competing sys-tems, surpassing the second best by 0.10.",
        "Noticing that expansion is not helpful when sufficient context is available, for the next variations we use the original tuples.",
        "Also, due to the reduced impact of knowledge-based features on the training outcome, we only focus on deep learning features (WTV1, WTV2, WTV3, WTV4).",
        "Shifting to sentence2phrase, WTV2 (con- structed using VectorSum) is the top performing feature, surpassing the baseline by 0.19, and attaining 0.69 and 0.73 on the train and test sets, respectively.",
        "Despite also considering a lower performing feature (WTV1), the meta-learner maintains high scores, surpassing the correlation achieved on the train data by 0.04 (from 0.70 to 0.74).",
        "In this variation, our system ranks fifth, at 0.035 from the top system.",
        "For the paragraph2sentence variation, due to the availability of longer contexts, we introduce WTV3 and WTV4 that are based on clustering the left and the right sides of the tuple, respectively.",
        "WTV2 fares slightly better than WTV3 and WTV4.",
        "WTV1 surpasses the baseline this time, leaving its mark on the decision process.",
        "When training the GP learner on all features, we obtain 0.78 correlation on the train data, and 0.81 on test data, 0.10 higher than those attained by the individual features alone.",
        "SimCompass ranks seventh in performance on this subtask, at 0.026 from the first.",
        "Considering the overall system performance, SimCompass is remarkably versatile, ranking among the top at each lexical level, and taking the first place in the SemEval Task 3 overall evaluation with respect to both Pearson (0.58 average correlation) and Spearman correlations.",
        "5 Conclusion We described SimCompass, the system we participated with at SemEval-2014 Task 3.",
        "Our experiments suggest that traditional knowledge-based features are cornered by novel corpus-based word meaning representations, such as word2vec, which emerge as efficient and strong performers under a variety of scenarios.",
        "We also explored whether context expansion is beneficial to the cross-level similarity task, and remarked that only when the context is particularly short, this enrichment is viable.",
        "However, in a meta-learning framework, the information permeating from a set of similarity measures exposed to varying context expansions can attain a higher performance than possible with individual signals.",
        "Overall, our system ranked first among 21 teams and 38 systems.",
