        "Cross level semantic similarity measures the similarity between different levels of text unit, for ex-ample, between a document and a paragraph, or between a phrase and a word.",
        "Paragraph and sentence are the natural language units to convey opinions or state events in daily life.",
        "We can see posts on forums, questions and answers in Q&A communities and customer reviews on E-commerce websites, are mainly organised in these two units.",
        "Better similarity measurement across them will be helpful in clustering similar answers or reviews.",
        "The paragraph-to-sentence semantic similarity subtask in SemEval2014 task3 (Jurgens et al., 2014) is the first semantic similarity competition across these two language levels.",
        "The special difficulty of this task is the length disparity between the compared pair: a paragraph contains This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "License details: http: //creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ 3.67 times the words of a sentence on average in the training set.",
        "Semantic similarity on different levels, for ex-ample, on word level (Mikolov et al., 2013), sentences level (B?ar et al., 2012), document level (Turney and Pantel, 2010), have been well studied, yet methods on one level can hardly be applied to a different level, let alone be applied for the cross-level tasks.",
        "The work of Pilehvar et al.(2013) was an exception.",
        "They proposed a unified method for semantic comparison at multi-levels all the way from comparing word senses to comparing text documents Our work is inspired by automatic machine translation(MT) evaluation, in which different metrics are designed to compare the adequacy and fluency of a MT system's output, called hypothe-sis, against a gold standard translation, called reference.",
        "As MT evaluation metrics measure sentence pair similarity, it is a natural idea to generalize them for paragraph-sentence pair.",
        "In this paper, we follow the motivations of several MT evaluation metrics yet made adaption to cope with the length disparity difficulty of this task, and combine these features in a regression model.",
        "Our system SSMT (Semantic Similarity in view of Machine Translation evaluation) involves no extensive resource or strenuous computation, yet gives promising result with just a few simple features.",
        "2 Regression Framework In our experiment, we use features adapted from some MT evaluation metrics and combine them in a regression model for the semantic similarity measurement.",
        "We exploit the following two simple models: A linear regression model is presented as: y = w 1 x i + w 2 x i ..+ w n x n + ?",
        "585 A log-linear model is presented as: y = x w 1 1 ?",
        "x w 2 2 .. ?",
        "x w n n ?",
        "e ?",
        "Where y is the similarity score, {x 1 , x 2 .., x n } are the feature values.",
        "We can see that in a log-linear model, if any feature x i get a value of 0, the output y will suck in 0 forever no matter what the values other features get.",
        "In our experiment we resort to smoothing to avoid this ?0-trap?",
        "for some features (Section 4.3).",
        "3 Features MT evaluation metrics vary from lexical level to syntactic level to semantic level.",
        "We consider only lexical ones to avoid complicated steps like parsing or semantic role labelling, which are computational expensive and may bring extra noise.",
        "But instead of directly using the MT evaluation metrics, we use the factors in them as features, the idea is that the overall score of the original metric is highly related to the length of both of the compared pair, but its factors are often related to the length of just one side yet still carry useful similarity information.",
        "3.1 BLEU-Derived Features As the most wildly used MT evaluation metric, BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) uses the geometric mean of n-gram precisions to measure the hypotheses against references.",
        "It is a corpus-based and precision-based metric, and uses ?brevity penalty?",
        "as a replacement for recall.",
        "Yet this penalty is meaningless on sentence level.",
        "Therefore we considers only the precision factors in BLEU: P n BLEU = Ngram ref ?Ngram hyo Ngram ref We use the modified n-gram precision here and regard ?paragraph?",
        "as ?reference?, and ?sentence?",
        "as the ?hypothesis?.",
        "N= 1,2,3,4.",
        "We call these four features BLEU-derived features.",
        "3.2 ROUGE-L-Derived Features ROUGE-L (Lin and Och, 2004) measures the largest common subsequence(LCS) between a compared pair.",
        "BLEU implies the n-gram to be consecutive, yet ROUGE-L allows for gaps between them.",
        "By considering only in-sequence words, ROUGE-L captures sentence level structure in a natural way, then: R lcs = LCS(ref, hyo) length(hyo) P lcs = LCS(ref, hyo) length(ref) F lcs = (1 + ?",
        "2 )R lcs P lcs ) R lcs + ?",
        "2 P lcs Where LCS(ref, hoy) is the length of LCS of the compared pair.",
        "We set ?",
        "= 1, which means we don't want to make much distinction between the ?reference?",
        "and ?hypothesis?",
        "here.",
        "We call these three features ROUGE-L-derived features.",
        "3.3 ROUGE-S-Derived Features ROUGE-S (Lin and Och, 2004) uses skip-bigram co-occurrence statistics for similarity measurement.",
        "One advantage of skip-bigram over BLEU is that it does not require consecutive matches but is still sensitive to word order.",
        "Given the reference of length n, and hypothesis of length m, then: P skip2 = skip2(ref, hyo) C(m, 2) R skip2 = skip2(ref, hyo) C(n, 2) F skip2 = (1 + ?",
        "2 )P skip2 R skip2 R skip2 + ?",

        "3.4 METEOR-Derived Features METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) evaluates a hypothesis by aligning it to a reference translation and gives sentence-level similarity scores.",
        "It uses a generalized concept of unigram mapping that matches words in the following types: exact match on words surface forms , stem match on words stems, synonym match according to the synonym sets in WordNet, and paraphrase match (Denkowski and Lavie, 2010).",
        "METEOR also makes distinction between content words and function words.",

        "Run2 is a linear-regression model with the same features as Run1.",

        "5 Conclusion MT evaluation metrics have been directly used as features in paraphrase (Finch et al., 2005) detection and sentence pair semantic comparison (Souza et al., 2012).",
        "But paragraph-to-sentence pair faces significant length disparity, we try a way out to alleviate this impact yet still follow the motivations underlying these metrics.",
        "By factorizing down the original metrics, the linear model can flexibly pick out factors that are not sensitive to the length disparity problem.",
        "We derive features from BLEU, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-S and METEOR, and show that METEOR-derived features make the most significant contributions here.",
        "Being easy and light, our submitted SSMT achieves 0.789 in Pearson and 0.777 in Spearman correlation, and ranks 11 out of the 34 systems in this subtask.",
