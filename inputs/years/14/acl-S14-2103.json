        "We trained an SVM classifier with a linear kernel using a variety of features.",
        "We used publicly available resources only, and thus our results should be easily replicable.",
        "Overall, our system is ranked 20th out of 50 submissions (by 44 teams) based on the average of the three 2014 evaluation data scores, with an F1-score of 63.62 on general tweets, 48.37 on sarcastic tweets, and 68.24 on LiveJournal messages."

        "Then, we discuss our experiments, results and analysis in Section 3.",
        "Finally, we conclude with possible directions for future work in Section 4.",
        "2 Method Our approach is inspired by the highest scoring team in 2013, NRC Canada (Mohammad et al., 2013).",
        "We reused many of their resources.",
        "1 Our system consists of two main submodules, (i) feature extraction in the framework of GATE (Cunningham et al., 2011), and (ii) machine learning using SVM with linear kernels as implemented in LIBLINEAR 2 (Fan et al., 2008).",
        "1 http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/ ?",

        "cjlin/ liblinear/ 590 2.1 Preprocessing We integrated a pipeline of various resources for tweet analysis that are already available in GATE (Bontcheva et al., 2013) such as a Twitter tok-enizer, a sentence splitter, a hashtag tokenizer, a Twitter POS tagger, a morphological analyzer, and the Snowball 3 stemmer.",
        "We further implemented in GATE some shallow text processing components in order to handle negation contexts, emoticons, elongated words, all-caps words and punctuation.",
        "We also added components to find words and phrases contained in sentiment lexicons, as well as to annotate words with word cluster IDs using the lexicon built at CMU, 4 which uses the Brown clusters (Brown et al., 1992) as implemented 5 by (Liang, 2005).",
        "2.2 Features 2.2.1 Sentiment lexicon features We used several preexisting lexicons, both manually designed and automatically generated: ?",
        "Minqing Hu and Bing Liu opinion lexicon (Hu and Liu, 2004): 4,783 positive and 2,006 negative terms; ?",
        "MPQA Subjectivity Cues Lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005): 8,222 terms; ?",
        "Macquarie Semantic Orientation Lexicon (MSOL) (Mohammad et al., 2009): 30,458 positive and 45,942 negative terms; ?",
        "NRC Emotion Lexicon (Mohammad et al., 2013): 14,181 terms with specified emotion.",
        "For each lexicon, we find in the tweet the terms that are listed in it, and then we calculate the following features: ?",
        "Negative terms count; ?",
        "Positive terms count; ?",
        "Positive negated terms count; ?",
        "Positive/negative terms count ratio; ?",
        "Sentiment of the last token; ?",
        "Overall sentiment terms count.",
        "3 http://snowball.tartarus.org/ 4 http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/TweetNLP/ cluster_viewer.html 5 http://github.com/percyliang/ brown-cluster We further used the following lexicons: ?",
        "NRC Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon: list of words and their associations with positive and negative sentiment (Mohammad et al., 2013): 54,129 unigrams, 316,531 bigrams, 480,010 pairs, and 78 high-quality positive and negative hashtag terms; ?",
        "Sentiment140 Lexicon: list of words with associations to positive and negative sentiments (Mohammad et al., 2013): 62,468 unigrams, 677,698 bigrams, 480,010 pairs; ?",
        "Stanford Sentiment Treebank: contains 239,231 evaluated words and phrases.",
        "If a word or a phrase was found in the tweet, we took the given sentiment label.",
        "For the NRC Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon and the Sentiment140 Lexicon, we calculated the following features for unigrams, bigrams and pairs: ?",
        "Sum of positive terms?",
        "sentiment; ?",
        "Sum of negative terms?",
        "sentiment; ?",

        "Max positive sentiment; ?",
        "Min negative sentiment; ?",
        "Max sentiment of a term.",
        "We used different features for the two lexicon groups because their contents differ.",
        "The first four lexicons provide a discrete sentiment value for each word.",
        "In contrast, the following two lexicons offer numeric sentiment scores, which allows for different feature types such as sums and min/max scores.",
        "Finally, we manually built a new lexicon with all emoticons we could find, where we assigned to each emoticon a positive or a negative label.",
        "We then calculated four features: number of positive and negative emoticons in the tweet, and whether the last token is a positive or a negative emoticon.",
        "591 2.2.2 Tweet-level features We use the following tweet-level features: ?",
        "All caps: the number of words with all characters in upper case; ?",
        "Hashtags: the number ot hashtags in the tweet; ?",
        "Elongated words: the number of words with character repetitions.",
        "2.2.3 Term-level features We used the following term-level features: ?",
        "Word n-grams: presence or absence of 1- grams, 2-grams, 3-grams, 4-grams, and 5- grams.",
        "We add an NGRAM prefix to each n-gram.",
        "Unfortunately, the n-grams increase the feature space greatly and contribute to higher sparseness.",
        "They also slow down training dramatically.",
        "That is why our final submission only includes 1-grams.",
        "?",
        "Character n-grams: presence or absence of one, two, three, four and five-character prefixes and suffixes of all words.",
        "We add a PRE or SUF prefix to each character n-gram.",
        "?",
        "Negations: the number of negated contexts.",
        "We define a negated context as a segment of a tweet that starts with a negation word (e.g., no, shouldnt) from our custom gazetteer and ends with one of the punctuation marks: ,, ., :, ;, !, ?.",
        "A negated context affects the n-gram and the lexicon features: we add a NEG suffix to each word following the negation word, e.g., perfect becomes perfect NEG.",
        "?",
        "Punctuation: the number of contiguous sequences of exclamation marks, of question marks, of either exclamation or question marks, and of both exclamation and question marks.",
        "Also, whether the last token contains an exclamation or a question mark (excluding URLs).",
        "?",
        "Stemmer: the stem of each word, excluding URLs.",
        "We add a STEM prefix to each stem.",
        "?",
        "Lemmatizer: the lemma of each word, excluding URLs.",
        "We add a LEMMA prefix to each lemma.",
        "We use the built-in GATE Morphological analyser as our lemmatizer.",
        "?",
        "Word and word bigram clusters: word clusters have been shown to improve the performance of supervised NLP models (Turian et al., 2010).",
        "We use the word clusters built by CMU's NLP toolkit, which were produced over a collection of 56 million English tweets (Owoputi et al., 2012) and built using the Percy Liang's HMM-based implementation 6 of Brown clustering (Liang, 2005; Brown et al., 1992), which group the words into 1,000 hierarchical clusters.",
        "We use two features based on these clusters: ?",
        "presence/absence of a word in a word cluster; ?",
        "presence/absence of a bigram in a bigram cluster.",
        "?",
        "POS tagging: Social media are generally hard to process using standard NLP tools, which are typically developed with newswire text in mind.",
        "Such standard tools are not a good fit for Twitter messages, which are too brief, contain typos and special word-forms.",
        "Thus, we used a specialized POS tagger, TwitIE, which is available in GATE (Bontcheva et al., 2013), and which we integrated in our pipeline.",
        "It provides (i) a tokenizer specifically trained to handle smi-lies, user names, URLs, etc., (ii) a normalizer to correct slang and misspellings, and (iii) a POS tagger that uses the Penn Treebank tagset, but is optimized for tweets.",
        "Using the TwitIE toolkit, we performed POS tagging and we extracted all POS tag types that we can find in the tweet together with their frequencies as features.",
        "2.3 Classifier For classification, we used the above features and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier as implemented in LIBLINEAR.",
        "This is a very scalable implementation of SVM that does not support kernels, and is suitable for classification on large datasets with a large number of features.",
        "This is particularly useful for text classification, where the number of features is very large, which means that the data is likely to be linearly separable, and thus using kernels is not really necessary.",
        "We scaled the SVM input and we used L2-regularization during training.",
        "6 https://github.com/percyliang/ brown-cluster 592 3 Experiments, Results, Analysis 3.1 Experimental setup At development time, we trained on train-2013, tuned the C value of SVM on dev-2013, and evaluated on test-2013 (Nakov et al., 2013).",
        "For our submission, we trained on train-2013+dev-2013, and we evaluated on the 2014 test dataset provided by the organizers.",
        "This dataset contains two parts and a total of five datasets: (a) progress test (the Twitter and SMS test datasets for 2013), and (b) new test datasets (from Twitter, from Twitter with sarcasm, and from LiveJournal).",
        "We used C=0.012, which was best on development.",
        "3.2 Official results Due to our very late entering in the competition, we have only managed to perform a small number of experiments, and we only participated in subtask B. We were ranked 20th out of 50 sub-missions; our official results are shown in Table 1.",
        "The numbers after our score are the delta to the best solution.",
        "We have also included a ranking among 2014 participant systems on the 2013 data sets, released by the organizers.",

        "They show the F1-scores and the loss when a feature or a group of features is removed; we show the impact on all test datasets, both from 2013 and from 2014.",
        "The exception here is the all + ngrams row, which contains our scores if we had used the n-grams feature group.",
        "The features are sorted by their impact on the Twitter2014 test set.",
        "We can see that the three most important feature groups are POS tags, word/bigram clusters, and lexicons.",
        "We can further see that although the overall lexicon feature group is beneficial, some of the lexicons actually hurt the 2014 score and we would have been better off without them.",
        "These are the Sentiment140 lexicon, the Stanford Sentiment Treebank and the NRC Emotion lexicon.",
        "The highest gain we get is from the lexicons of Minqing Hu and Bing Liu.",
        "It must be noted that using lexicons with good results apparently depends on the context, e.g., the Sentiment140 lexicon seems to be helping a lot with the LiveJournal test dataset, but it hurts the Sarcasm score by a sizeable margin.",
        "Another interesting observation is that even though including the n-gram feature group is performing notably better on the Twitter2013 test dataset, it actually worsens performance on all 2014 test sets.",
        "Had we included it in our results, we would have scored lower.",
        "The negation context feature brings little in regards to regular tweets or LiveJournal text, but it heavily improves our score on the Sarcasm tweets.",
        "It is unclear why our results differ so much from those of the NRC-Canada team in 2013 since our features are quite similar.",
        "We attribute the difference to the fact that some of the lexicons we use actually hurt our score as we mentioned above.",
        "Another difference could be that last year's NRC system uses n-grams, which we have disabled as they lowered our scores.",
        "Last but not least, there could be bugs lurking in our feature representation that additionally lower our results.",
        "3.4 Post-submission improvements First, we did more extensive experiments to validate our classifier's C value.",
        "We found that the best value for C is actually 0.08 instead of our original proposal 0.012.",
        "Then, we experimented further with our lexicon features and we removed the following ones, which resulted in significant improvement over our submitted version: ?",
        "Sentiment of the last token for NRC Emotion, MSOL, MPQA, and Bing Liu lexicons; ?",
        "Max term positive, negative and sentiment scores for unigrams of Sentiment140 and NRC Sentiment lexicons; ?",
