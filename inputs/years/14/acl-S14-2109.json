        "Semantic relatedness between texts have been dealt with in multiple situations earlier.",
        "But it is not usual to measure the semantic relatedness of texts of varying lengths such as Paragraph to Sentence (P2S) and Sentence to Phrase (S2P).",
        "This task will be useful in natural language processing applications such as paraphrasing and summa-rization.",
        "The working principle of information retrieval system is the motivation for this task, where the queries are not of equal lengths compared to the documents in the index.",
        "We attempted two ways to measure the semantic similarity for P2S and S2P in a scale of 0 to 4, 4 meaning both texts are similar and 0 being dissimilar.",
        "The first one is Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and second, a bag-of-vecors (BV) approach.",
        "An example of target similarity ratings for comparison type S2P is provided in table 1.",

        "In the training data for P2S, newswire text constituted 36% of the data, while reviews constituted 10% of the data and rest of the three genres shared 54% of the data.",

        "The first representation was created with bi-gram co-occurance count as mentioned in section 3.2.1 and experiments were carried out as mentioned in section 3.2.2.",
        "This produced negative Pearson correlation scores for P2S and S2P.",
        "Then we created another representation by getting co-occurance count in a window of 6 words in a sentence, on evaluation produced correlation scores of 0.094 for P2S and 0.145 for S2P.",
        "As BV showed strong negative results, we did not continue using the method for evaluating the test data.",
        "But we strongly believe that the BV approach can produce better results if we could compare the sentence to the paragraph rather than the paragraph to the sentence as mentioned in section 3.2.2.",
        "During similarity calcula-tion, when comparing sentence to the paragraph, for each word in the sentence, we look for the best semantic match from the paragraph, which would increase the mean value by reducing the number of divisions representing the number of words in the sentence.",
        "In the current setting, it is believed that while computing the similarity for the paragraph to sentence, the words in the paragraph (longer text) will consider a few words in the sentence to be similar multiple times.",
        "This could not be right when we compare the texts of varying lengths.",
        "5 Conclusion and Discussion On manual verification, it was identified that the dataset used to build the representation did not have documents related to the genres Metaphoric, CQA and Travel.",
        "The original dataset mostly had documents from Newswire text and blogs which included reviews as well.",
        "Further, it can be identified from tables 2 and 3, the word-document representation with added documents from the training set improved Pearson scores.",
        "This allowed to assume that the dataset did not have completely relevant set of documents to evaluate the training set which included data from different genres.",
        "For evaluation of the model on test data, we submitted two runs and best of them reported Pearson score of 0.607 and 0.552 on P2S and S2P respectively.",
        "In the future work, we should be able to experiment with more relevant data to build the model using LSI and also use statistically strong unsupervised classifier pLSI (Hofmann T, 2001) for the same task.",
        "Further to this, as discussed in 4.2 we would be able to experiment with the BV approach by comparing the sentence to the paragraph, which we believe will yield promising results to compare the texts of varying lengths.",
