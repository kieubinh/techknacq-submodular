        "Research in exploiting social media for measuring public opinion, evaluating popularity of products and brands, anticipating stock-market trends, or predicting elections showed promising results (O?Connor et al., 2010; Mitchell et al., 2013).",
        "However, this type of content poses a particularly challenging problem for text analysis systems.",
        "Typical messages show heavy use of Internet slang, emoticons and other abbreviations and discourse conventions.",
        "The lexical variation introduced by this creative use of language, together with the unconventional spelling and occasional typos, leads to very large vocabularies.",
        "On the other hand, messages are very short, and therefore word feature representations tend to become very sparse, degrading the performance of machine learned classifiers.",
        "The growing interest in this problem motivated the creation of a shared task for Twitter Sentiment Analysis in the 2013 edition of SemEval.",
        "The Message Polarity Classification task was formalized as follows: Given a message, decide whether the message is of positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.",
        "For messages conveying both a positive ",
        "Licence details: http: //creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Positive Neutral Negative Train 2014 3230 4109 1265 Tweets 2013 1572 1640 601 Tweets 2014 982 669 202 SMS 2013 492 1207 394 Tweets Sarcasm 2014 33 13 40 LiveJournal 2014 427 411 304 Table 1: Number of examples per class in each SemEval dataset.",
        "The first row represents all training data; the other rows are sets used for testing.",
        "and negative sentiment, whichever is the stronger sentiment should be chosen (Nakov et al., 2013).",
        "We describe our participation on the 2014 edition of this task, for which a set of manually labelled messages was created.",
        "Complying with the Twitter policies for data access, the corpus was distributed as a list of message IDs and each participant was responsible for downloading the actual tweets.",
        "Using the provided script, we collected a training set with 8604 tweets.",
        "After sub-mission, the 2014 test sets were also made available.",
        "Along with the Tweets 2014 test set, evaluation was also performed on a set of tweets with sarcasm, on a set of LiveJournal blog entries, and on sets of tweets and SMS messages from the 2013 edition of the task.",
        "Table 1 shows the class distribution for each of these datasets.",
        "In the 2013 edition (task 2B), the NRC-Canada system (Mohammad et al., 2013) earned first place by scoring 69.02% on the Official SemEval metric (see Section 4) with a significant margin with respect to the other systems: the second (G?unther and Furrer, 2013) and third (Reckman et al., 2013) best systems scored 65.27% and 64.86%, respectively.",
        "The main novelty in the NRC-Canada system was the use of sentiment lexicons, specific for the Twitter domain, generated from unlabeled tweets using emoticons and hashtags as indicators of sentiment.",
        "They found that these lexicons had a strong impact on the results ?",
        "more than word and 673 character n-grams.",
        "The automatically induced lexicons are a way to use information from unlabeled data to aid in the classification task.",
        "In our approach, we take this reasoning further, and focus on the impact of various ways to incorporate knowledge from unlabeled data.",
        "This allows us to mimic many real-world scenarios where labelled data is scarce but unlabeled data is plentiful.",
        "2 Word Representations In text classification it is common to represent documents as bags-of-words, i.e., as unordered collections of words.",
        "However, in the case of very short social media texts, these representations become less effective, as they lead to increased data sparseness.",
        "We focused our experiments in comparing and complementing these approaches with denser representations, which we now describe.",
        "2.1 Bag-Of-Words and ?BM25 In a representation based on bags-of-words, each message is represented as a vector m = {w 1 , w 2 , ..., w n } ?",
        "R V , where V is the size of the vocabulary.",
        "In order to have weights that reflect how relevant a word is to each of the classes, we weighted the individual terms according to the ?BM25 heuristic (Paltoglou and Thelwall, 2010): ?BM25(w i ) = tf i ?",
        "log ( (N p ?df i,p +s)?df i,n +s (N n ?df i,n +s)?df i,p +s ) , (1) where tf i represents the frequency of term i in the message, N a is the size of corpus a, df i,a is the document frequency of term i in the corpus a (i.e., in one of two subsets for the training data, corresponding to either positive or negative messages), and s is a smoothing constant, which we set to 0.5.",
        "This term weighting function was previously shown to be effective for sentiment analysis.",
        "2.2 Brown Clusters Brown et al. (1992) proposed a greedy agglomerative hierarchical clustering procedure that groups words to maximize the mutual information of bi-grams.",
        "Clusters are initialized as consisting of a single word each, and are then greedily merged according to a mutual information criterion, to form a lower-dimensional representation of a vocabulary.",
        "The hierarchical nature of the clustering allows words to be represented at different levels in the hierarchy.",
        "This approach provides a denser representation of the messages, mitigating the feature sparseness problem.",
        "We used a publicly available 1 set of 1000 Brown clusters induced from a corpus of 56 million Twitter messages.",
        "We leveraged the word clusters by mapping each word to the corresponding cluster, and we then represented each message as a bag-of-clusters vector in R K , where K = 1000 is the number of clusters.",
        "These word cluster features were also weighted with the ?BM25 scheme.",
        "2.3 Concise Semantic Analysis Concise Semantic Analysis is a form of term and document representation that assigns, to each term, its weight on each of the classes (Li et al., 2011).",
        "These weights, computed from the frequencies of the term on the training data, reflect how associated the term is to each class.",
        "The weight of term j in class c is given by (Lopez- Monroy et al., 2013): w cj = ?",

To prevent labels with a higher number of examples, or terms with higher frequencies, to have stronger weights, an additional normalization step is performed to obtain nw cj , the normalized weight of term j in class c: nw cj = w cj ?",

        "j?m tf j len(m) ?",
        "t j .",
        "(4) In the formula, tf j is the frequency of term j in m. 2.4 Dense Word Vectors Efficient approaches have recently been introduced to train neural networks capable of producing continuous representations of words (Mikolov 1 http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/TweetNLP/ 674 Lexicon #1-grams #2-grams #pairs Bing Liu 6789 - MPQA 8222 - SentiStrength 2546 - NRC EmoLex 14177 - Sentiment140 62468 677698 480010 NRC HashSent 54129 316531 308808 Table 2: Number of unigrams, bigrams, and collocation pairs, in the lexicons used in our system.",
        "et al., 2013).",
        "These approaches allow fast training of projections from a representation based on bags-of-words, where vectors have very high dimension (of the order of 10 4 ), but are also very sparse and integer-valued, to vectors of much lower dimensions (of the order of 10 2 ), with full density and continuous values.",
        "To induce word embeddings, a corpus of 17 million Twitter messages was collected with the Twitter crawler of Boanjak et al. (2012).",
        "Then, using word2vec 2 , we induced representations for the word tokens occurring in the messages.",
        "All the tokens were represented as vectors w j ?",
        "R n , with n = 100.",
        "A message was modeled as the sum of the vector representations of the individual words: m vec = ?",
        "j?m w j .",
        "(5) We also created a polarity class vector p c for each class c, defined as: p c = 1 N c ?",
        "m?c m vec , (6) where m is a message of class c and N c is the total number of instances in class c. These vectors can be interpreted as prototypes of their classes, and are used in the classVec features described below.",
        "3 The TUGAS System We now describe the TUGAS approach, detailing the considered features and our modeling choices.",
        "3.1 Word Features To reduce the feature space of the model, messages were lower-cased, Twitter user mentions (@username) were replaced with the token <USER> and URLs were replaced with the <URL> token.",
        "We also normalized words to include at most 3 repeated characters (e.g., 2 https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/ ?helloooooo!?",
        "to ?hellooo!?).",
        "Following Pang et al. (2002), negation was directly integrated into the word representations.",
        "All the tokens occurring between a negation word and the next punctuation mark, were suffixed with the NEG annotation.",
        "We used the following groups of features: ?",
        "bow-uni: vector of word unigrams ?",
        "bow-bc: vector of Brown word clusters ?",
        "csa: Concise Semantic Analysis vector m csa ?",
        "wordVec: word2vec message vector m vec ?",
        "classVec: Euclidean distance between message vector m vec and each class vector p c 3.2 Lexicon Features The document model was enriched with features that take into account the presence of words with a known prior polarity, such as happy or sad.",
        "We included words from manually annotated sentiment lexicons: Bing Liu Opinion Lexicon (Hu and Liu, 2004), MPQA (Wilson et al., 2005) and the NRC Emotion Lexicon (Mohammad and Turney, 2013).",
        "We also used the two automatically generated lexicons from Mohammad et al. (2013): the NRC Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon and the Sentiment140 Lexicon.",
        "Table 2 summarizes the number of terms of each lexicon.",
        "As Mohammad et al. (2013), we added the following set of lexicon features, for each lexicon, and for each combination of negated/non-negated words and positive/negative polarity.",
        "?",
        "The sum of the sentiment scores of all (negated/non-negated) terms with (posi- tive/negative) sentiment ?",
        "The largest of those scores ?",
        "The sentiment score of the last word in the message that is also present in the lexicon ?",
        "The number of terms within the lexicon Notice that terms can be unigrams, bigrams, and collocations pairs.",
        "A group of these features was computed for each of the sentiment lexicons.",
        "3.3 Syntactic Features We extracted syntactic features aimed at the Twitter domain, such as the use of heavy punctuation, emoticons and character repetition.",
        "Concretely, the following features were computed from the original Twitter messages: ?",
