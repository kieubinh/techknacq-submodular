        "Its main purpose is to automatically assign the correct polarity for the aspect term in a phrase.",
        "It is a probabilistic automata where each state consists of all the nouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs found in an annotated corpora.",
        "Each one of them contains the number of occurrences in the annotated corpora for the four required polarities (i.e. positive, negative, neutral and conflict).",
        "Also, the transitions between states have been taken into account.",
        "These values were used to assign the predicted polarity when a pattern was found in a sentence; if a pattern cannot be applied, the probabilities of the polarities between states were computed in order to predict the right polarity.",
        "The system achieved results around 66% and 57% of recall for the restaurant and laptop domain respectively."

        "?Texts can provide factual information, such as: descriptions, lists of characteristics, or even instructions to opinion-based information, which would include reviews, emotions, or feelings.",
        "These facts have motivated dealing with the identification and extraction of opinions and sentiments in texts that require special attention.?",
        "(Guti?rrez, et al., 2014).",
        "Sentiment Analysis or ?Subjectivity Analysis?",
        "in (Liu, 2010) is defined as the computational treatment of opinions, sentiments and emotions expressed in a text.",
        "In order to automatically treat the subjectivity, we need lexical resources that allow the detection and evaluation of the affective/ subjective charges in texts, its polarity and intensity.",
        "Regarding research carried out for linguistic patterns identification and its polarity in texts, it is worth mentioning works on: adjectives (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) (Wiebe, 2000); adjectives and verbs (Turney, 2002) (Wilson, et al., 2005) (Takamura, et al., 2007); and also verbs and names (Esuli and Sebastini, 2006).",
        "WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) has also been used for the collection of opinion adjectives and verbs (Kim and Hovy, 2005) to determine the semantic orientation of the terms depending on their notes (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005), for the adjective extraction (Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006) or opinion mining (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2007).",
        "Inspired on Hidden Markov models (Baum and Petrie, 1966) and following the idea that words combinations are finite in an evaluation text, we decided to create a finite automata in graph form to represent all these relations extracted from a training corpus.",
        "For the creation of this automata we utilised different resources, such as WordNet and OpinionFinder Subjectivity Lexicon.",
        "Also, different extracted patterns based on (Cazab?n, 1973) were applied.",
        "This paper is structured as follows: In section 1.1 is described the task 4 of SemEval2014 (Pontiki, et al., 2014) where this system was presented.",
        "Section 2 presents the description of the automata and how it was built.",
        "The polarity assignation method using the trained automata is _________________________ ",

        "1.1 Task Description The SemEval2014 task 4 (Pontiki, et al., 2014) was divided into four subtasks: 4.1 Aspect term extraction; 4.2 Aspect term polarity; 4.3 Aspect category detection; and 4.4 Aspect category polarity.",
        "This paper is focused on subtask 4.2 which is described as follows: Given one or more Aspect Terms within a sentence, it is necessary to determine whether the polarity of each Aspect Term is positive, negative, neutral or conflict (i.e., both positive and negative).",
        "For example: ?I loved their fajitas?",

        "First, we verify whether the Aspect Term is part of a phrase which was matched to a pattern but no polarity was found as explained in section 3.2, if so we get the subjectivity clues of the phrase and for each subjectivity clue we calculate ??",

        "After performing these steps we apply our selection criteria to assign the polarity to the Aspect Term in question.",

        "Otherwise, if a pattern is not encountered we need to analyse the words that are closer to the Aspect Term determining the polarity according to the context.",

        "2 http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task4/data/semeval14-absa-base-eval-valid.zip 5 Conclusions and future works This work introduces a new approach for aspect based sentiment analysis.",
        "For that, a probabilistic automata was created where the states are formed by the nouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs found in the annotated corpora, based on their occurrence.",
        "The transitions between states are also taken into account.",
        "A set of patterns were defined in order to extract the words that influence on an Aspect Term, also known as subjectivity clues, and then we predicted their polarity using the automata's probabilities.",
        "A system was developed following this approach to participate on SemEval2014 competition, obtaining an accuracy of 66% for restaurant reviews and 57% for laptop reviews.",
        "As future works we plan to deal with the fact that this automata only involves states represented by the words lack extracted from the training data.",
        "So, the previously unseen aspect terms which do not correspond to any state in the automata, are not recognised in many cases as far as the polarity is concerned.",
        "To address this issue we plan to 725 expand the aspect term dictionary using Wikipedia definitions.",
        "On the other hand, we plan to use a disambiguation method to select the exact WordNet synset and then to reduce the polysemy of the automata's words.",
        "Finally, to smooth the probabilities it would be interesting to study different balances in order to get new improvements for the system.",
