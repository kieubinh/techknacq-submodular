        "M is then approximated by M k = U k S k V T k , where only the first k columns of U and V are used, corresponding to the first k greatest singular values.",
        "This approximation supplies a way to project a generic wordw i into the k-dimensional space using W = U k S 1/2 k , where each row corresponds to the representation vector ~w i .",
        "The result is that every word is projected in the reduced Word Space and a sentence is represented by applying an additive model as an unbiased linear combination.",
        "We adopted these vector representations using a linear kernel, as in (Cristianini et al., 2002), i.e. lin WS and a Radial Basis Function Kernel rbf WS .",
        "In Aspect Category Detection, and more generally in topic classification tasks, some specific words can be an effective indicator of the underlying topic.",

        "A category is assigned if the SVM classifiers provides a positive prediction.",
        "The anecdotes/miscellaneous acceptance threshold has been set to 0.3 (it has been estimated over a development set) due to its poor precision observed during the tuning phase.",
        "Moreover, considering each sentence is always associated to at least one category, if no label has been assigned, then the sentence is labelled with the category associated to the highest prediction.",
        "In the unconstrained case, each class has been tackled using an ensemble of a two binary SVM-based classifiers.",
        "The first classifier is a multi-kernel SVM operating on a linear combination of rbf WS and poly 2 BoW .",
        "The second classifier is a SVM equipped with a rbf WSTO .",
        "A sentence is labelled with a category if at least one of the two corresponding classifiers predicts that label.",
        "The first classifier assigns a label if the corresponding prediction is positive.",
        "A more conservative strategy is applied to the second classifier, and a category is selected if its corresponding prediction is higher than 0.3; again this threshold has been estimated over a development set.",
        "As in the constrained ver-sion, we observed a poor precision in the anec-dotes/miscellaneous category, so we increased the first classifier acceptance threshold to 0.3, while the second classifier output is completely ignored.",
        "Finally, if no label has been assigned, the sentence is labelled with the category associated to the highest prediction of the first classifier.",

        "Considering the simplicity of the proposed approach, the results are impressive.",
        "The ensemble schema, adopted in the unconstrained version, is very useful in improving the recall and allows the system to achieve the second position in the competition.",
        "4.4 Aspect Category Polarity The Aspect Category Polarity subtask has been modeled as a multi-class classification problem: given a set of pre-identified aspect categories for a sentence, it aims at determining the polarity (pos- itive, negative, neutral or conflict) of each category.",
        "It has been tackled using multi-kernel SVMs in a One-vs-All Schema.",
        "In the constrained set-ting, the linear combination of the following kernel functions has been used: ptk GRCT , poly 2 BoW that consider all the lemmatized terms in the sen-tence, a poly 2 BoW that considers only verbs, nouns adjective and adverbs in the sentence, lin LB derived from the MPQA sentiment lexicon.",
        "In the unconstrained case the sptk GRCT replaces the ptk counterpart and the rbf WS is added by linearly combining Word Space vectors for verbs, nouns adjective and adverbs.",
        "Again, results shown in Table 6 suggest the positive contribution of the lexical generalization provided by the Word Space (in the sptk GRCT and rbf WS ) allows to achieve a good rank, i.e. the 4 th position with the unconstrained system in the restaurant domain.",
        "The error analysis underlines that the proposed features do not capture irony.",
