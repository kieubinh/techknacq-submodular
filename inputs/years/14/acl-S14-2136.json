        "A domain is broadly defined as a set of documents demonstrating a similar distribution of words and linguistic patterns.",
        "Task 9 of SemEval treats Twitter as a single domain with respect to sentiment analysis.",
        "However previous research has argued for the topic-specific treatment of sentiment given domain-specific nuances and the over-generality of current sentiment analysis systems with respect to applications in the social sciences (Thelwall and Buckley, 2013).",
        "Thelwal's method manually extending a sentiment lexicon for a particular topic or domain highlights that expression of sentiment varies from one domain to another.",
        "Rather than relying on the manual extension of lexica, we developed an approach to Twitter sentiment classification that is domain sensitive.",
        "To this effect we gathered tweets from three primary domains financial news, political opinion, technology companies and their products and trained our system on one domain while adapting to the other.",
        "Using this methodology we obtained both intrinsic as well as extrinsic evaluation of the system on real world applications with promising results.",
        "As our approach to sentiment analysis has been influenced by the task description of SemEval 2013 we ",

        "Table 1: The distribution of sentiment classes between SemEval and our corpus at word and tweet level.",
        "decided to also evaluate the system on SemEval's data, since it provides a well established benchmark.",
        "In the following we briefly describe our system and corpus and discuss our approach for the SemEval submission.",
        "2 A Corpus of Three Domains: Source of Unconstrained Data Our goal in developing SentiAdaptron was domain adaptive tweet-level classification.",
        "We decided to follow SemEval 2013 and collect both word-level as well as message level annotations.",
        "We prepared a corpus of 4000 tweets with a balanced coverage of financial, political and technology related tweets.",
        "Tweets were collected using keywords from domain-specific websites: the final list was chosen after evaluating each candidate keyword's popularity using a third-party service 1 .",
        "Each tweet is tagged with multiple candidate domains, based on a hierarchy of terms generated from the original keyword list and tweets are filtered using a clustering methodology based on the DBSCAN clustering algorithm to remove robotic and repetitive tweets.",
        "We performed domain disambiguation for annotation through keyword filtering and also by picking a number of synsets from WordNet and computing the tweet's mean semantic distance using the NLTK toolkit.",
        "Tweets which didn't contain 1 http://topsy.com 768 any words associated with a score of less than 0.3 in SentiWordNet were removed, in a manner similar to Nakov et al (2013).",
        "After further manual relevance checks, the remaining tweets were submitted to Amazon's Mechanical Turk service for message and phrase-level annotation.",
        "We initially used the form demonstrated by Nakov et al., although we later redesigned it with a dramatic improvement in annotator performance and annotation quality.",
        "Each tweet was annotated by four workers and annotation sparsity at the phrase level was addressed by taking the majority of annotations following the precedence neutral > pos > neg > other.",
        "This is in contrast to the approach used by Nakov et al. for SemEval which intersects annotations.",
        "Annotations at the tweet level were aggregated using a majority vote.",
        "We found that using the proportion of positive, negative and neutral words in a tweet is a surprisingly robust feature for cross-domain classification, and boosted our performance when using bigrams.",
        "3 Subjectivity Detection and Contextual Polarity Disambiguation (Subtask A) Sentiment lexicons such as SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006), the NRC emotions lexicon (Mohammad and Turney, 2010), the MPQA lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005) and the Bing Liu Lexicon (Hu and Liu, 2004) have been used for determining whether a phrase should be labelled as positive, negative or neutral within a tweet or sentence (contextual polarity).",
        "However, lexical resources are by nature non-contextual and may not have good coverage over a given domain.",
        "We instead considered how to infer contextual polarity purely from the data available.",
        "To address the problem of class imbalance in the tweets, we break the problem of contextual polarity detection into two stages: (i) we first determine whether a given word should be assigned a positive, negative or neutral annotation (subjectiv- ity detection) and (ii) distinguish subjective tweets into positive, negative neutral.",
        "3.1 Contextual Subjectivity Detection Task A asks participants to predict the contextual subjectivity annotation of a text span at a given offset: our extrinsic applications don't have this fundamental structure, so we considered whether it was possible to automatically separate the content of input documents into those regions which should be assigned an annotation and those which should not.",
        "We considered a unigram and a bigram baseline using a naive Bayes classifier, which gave an F1 score of 0.640 and 0.520 respectively on our in domain data (under 10-fold cross-validation).",
        "We followed a number of approaches to subjectivity detection to try and improve on the baseline including sequential modelling using linear-chain Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) with CRF-suite (Okazaki, 2007) and lexical inference using semantically disambiguated WordNet (Miller, 1995) synsets in conjunction with their occurrence in a subjective context.",
        "We found that the observed subjective proportion of a given word alongside its successor and predecessor 2 was a viable feature engineering scheme, which we call neighbouring subjectivity proportions.",
        "This gave the best subjectivity performance on our in-domain data when fed to a voted perceptron (Freund and Schapire, 1999), an ensemble approach which assigns particularly predictive iterations of an incrementally trained perceptron a greater weight when deciding the final classification, and offers wide-margin classification akin to support vector machines whilst also requiring less parameter exploration.",
        "We used the implementation provided by the WEKA machine-learning environment (Hall et al., 2009), which achieved an F1-score of 0.740 (again under 10- fold cross validation) for our in-domain data, but performance dropped to an F1-score of 0.323 on the SemEval 2013 training and development data.",
        "Table 1 indicates that the proportion of objective features in SemEval is much greater than that seen within our own corpus, likely due to the differences in the way we processed annotations (out- lined in Section 2).",
        "3.2 Contextual Polarity We considered a naive Bayes unigram baseline, (similar approaches have proven popular with SemEval 2013 participants for Task A) and achieved an F1-measure of 0.662 when training using Se-mEval's 2014 training and development data and evaluating on SemEval's 2013 gold-standard annotations.",
        "However we could not detect the neutral class, and the test did not consider the objective class.",
        "2 As an example, if we observe 14 total occurrences of the word ?heartbreaking?, and 13 of them appear with a positive, negative or neutral label, the subjective proportion computed would be 13/14.",

        "We improved on this baseline by combining un-igrams with information from the wider context of the tweet.",
        "The algorithm first runs subjectivity detection on the entire document and then, for each word we need to classify (or otherwise each word detected as subjective), effectively generates two bags of words consisting of the subjective words before and after that word (we also included any adverbs as annotated by the Gimpel tagger (2011) in this bag to improve robustness).",
        "We output the word itself as a further feature, and use a random forest classifier (10 trees, log 2 N + 1 features) to generate the annotation.",
        "We found this approach outperformed the other approaches we tried (in- cluding Naive Bayes and OneR) and also gave us better F1-scores on the neutral class.",
        "Results from this approach for our in-domain data and the SemEval 2014 data can be seen in Table 2a.",
        "The drop in performance from our in-domain data to SemEval 2014 can be explained by the different class distribution observed in SemEval (Table 1).",
        "Subjectivity detection was used to generate features for subtask B, but not subtask A, where the target subjective phrases are already given.",
        "4 Message Polarity Classification (Subtask B) We tried various different combinations of features to discover the best intra-domain classification approach for our corpus and found that the proportion of positive, negative and neutral words within a tweet boosted performance using bigram binary features (Table 3).",
        "This involves first running the contextual polarity detection component as described in Section 3 and feeding in the results as features (together with bigrams) into a naive Bayes classifier for tweet level sentiment detection.",
        "However, one of our hypotheses was that domain adaptation could help improve performance when moving from one domain to another, effectively allowing us to port our classifier from our own corpus to SemEval.",
        "4.1 Cross-Domain Adaptation Our research in domain adaptation uses and extends the technique described by Blitzer and Pereira (2007) called Structural Correspondence Learning (SCL), which derives a relationship (or correspondence) between features from two different domains.",
        "This is done via pivot features selected from the intersection of features from both domains which have been ranked according to mutual information.",
        "The technique then uses N pivot features from both the seen and unseen domains to learn a set of binary problems corresponding to whether a given pivot exists in a target document.",
        "A perceptron is then used to train each of the binary problems, giving a matrix of weights (where a weight represents covariance of non pivot features with pivot features).",
        "We extended Blitzer's technique to encompass the neutral class and gave a wider notion of domain than previously found in the literature.",

        "We found that the amount of mutual information in our three domains was very low and was practically zero for the three class version of our problem.",
        "The results for the binary version of the classifier generated poorer results (Table 4) than those produced by our back-up classifier (based on the naive Bayes bigrams and subjective phrase proportions from the source domain, see Table 5, last three rows).",
        "Therefore we generated our submission to SemEval 2014 based on bigrams and subjective proportions rather than SCL, since we found that the proportion of pos/neg/neutral phrases is a robust feature across domains (as long as it can be reliably predicted during the contextual polarity prediction stage, which was the case for our data).",
        "Our results for SemEval task B using the subjective phrase proportions can be found in Table 2b.",
        "Our unconstrained performance indicates that whilst this classifier provides reasonable cross domain performance for our own data (Table 5), it is very sensitive to the performance of subjectivity and contextual polarity detection, which is lower for SemEval than it is for our own corpus.",
        "Presumably the reason for this is the different assumptions in annotations in the two cases and the differences in the class distributions between SemEval and our own data.",
        "This meant that our performance was lower than systems that had specifically trained on the SemEval data.",
        "5 Conclusions Our goal was to demonstrate the potential of domain sensitivity and domain adaptability for sentiment analysis in tweets a task which brings challenges defying the use of fixed lexica.",
        "We found that the proportions of positive, negative and neutral tweets are quite robust cross-domain features, although we do think that domain adaptation techniques such as Structural Correspondence Learning merit further investigation in the context of sentiment analysis for Twitter.",
