        "Finally, the polarity of the feature, in a given review, is determined from the positive and negative scores of each word related to it.",

        "Hundreds of millions of people and thousands of companies around the world, actively use Social Media 2 .",
        "Every day are more amazing websites and applications (Facebook, Twitter, MyS-pace, Amazon, etc.)",
        "that allow the easy sharing of information in near real time.",
        "For this rea-son, at present, the Web is flooded with subjec-tive, personal and affective data.",
        "Mining this huge ",
        "1 http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/parser/ 2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social media volume of information offer both interesting challenges and useful intelligent applications such as recommendation systems (Dong et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2009) and customer's reviews summarization (Bafna and Toshniwal, 2013; Balahur and Montoyo, 2008).",
        "Nowadays, companies have redirected their marketing strategies toward the Web.",
        "Each one of them advertises that their products are the best, amazing, easy to use, long lasting and cheap.",
        "But are these advertisements really true?",
        "Obviously, not everything is true.",
        "The companies usually exaggerate the product's quality and in many cases tend not to advertise the limitations of their products.",
        "Therefore, taking a rational decision about which product is the best among the variety of existing options can be very stressful.",
        "To avoid this situation, frequently we trust in the experiences gained by others who have purchased the product of our interest, or one similar.",
        "The existence of websites like Ciao 3 , Epinions 4 and Cnet 5 make possible to the customers to interchange their experiences about a specific product, and to future clients avoid products advertising However, the existence of a large volume of reviews entails that it is impossible to conduct an effective exploration before making a final decision.",
        "The most important benefit of having that amount of user-generated content on hand, specifically product's reviews, is that, these data can be explored by a computer system to obtain information about products and their features.",
        "The task of aspect-based sentiment analysis (Liu, 2012) is a fine-grained level of Sentiment Analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "This aim to identify the aspects (e.g., battery, screen, food, ser-vice, size, weight, time-life) of given target entities 3 www.ciao.com 4 www.epinions.com 5 www.cnet.com 773 (e.g., laptops, restaurants, camera) and the sentiment expressed towards each aspect (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).",
        "This are composed by two basic phases: feature extraction and feature polarity classification.",

        "In this approach we only focus on the polarity classification problem.",
        "For this, we induce a domain-dependent sentiment lexicon applying Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) on product reviews corpus, gathered from Ciao.",
        "The classification phase is carried out as follow: the opinion words related with the product aspect are draw out using the dependency relations provided by Stanford Parser, then the polarity of the extracted words are combined to obtain overall aspect polarity.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes our approach.",

        "Finally, section 4 provides concluding remarks.",
        "2 UO UA System One of major challenge in sentiment analysis into product reviews, is dealing with a quite domain dependence.",
        "For instance, the word ?unpredictable?",
        "can be considered as positive in Movie domain, however it is very negative in Airplane domain.",
        "For this reason, we propose to create a specific sentiment lexicon for addressing aspect based sentiment analysis in reviews.",
        "Our proposal is divided in two main phases.",
        "The first one aims to build a domain-dependent sentiment resource for Laptop domain applying LSA.",
        "The second phase obtains the words related by means of some dependency relation with the as-pect, and later, the polarity of these words are obtained from induced polarity lexicon and combined for computing overall aspect polarity.",
        "2.1 Domain-Dependent Polarity Lexicon The use of sentiment resource has been proven to be useful to build, train, and evaluate systems for sentiment analysis (Guti?errez et al., 2013; Bal-ahur, 2011).",
        "In order to build sentiment resource, several approach has been presented.",
        "In one of the first works, presented by (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997), was proposed to take into account if adjectives are linked by adversative or copulative conjunctions for detecting its polarity.",
        "In (Turney and Littman, 2003) the authors exposed a method for inferring the semantic orientation of a word from its statistical association with a set of positive and negative paradigm words, measured by point-wise mutual information (PMI).",
        "In (2004), Hu and Liu suggested a technique to expand the lexicon using the relations of synonymy and antonym provided by WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "In (2009), Cruz et al., created a sentiment resource based on a graph, constructed from conjunctive expressions between pairs of adjectives, observed in a review corpus.",
        "PageRank algorithm (Page et al., 1999) was adapted to be used on graphs with positive and negative edges, in order to obtain the semantic orientation of words.",
        "Despite the wide range of existing proposals for resources construction, the results achieved with them are far from expected.",
        "As we have already seen, in aspect based sentiment analy-sis, the polarity of a word is heavily dependent on the domain; and general propose sentiment resource such as General Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966), WordNet-Affect(Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004), SentiWordNet(Baccianella et al., 2010) or HowNet (Dong et al., 2010) do not capture this dependency.",
        "On the other hand, the human annotators can not create specific sentiment resources for each new product launched to market.",
        "There-fore, propose methods to create these resources is a challenging task.",
        "In this paper we address this task, presenting a framework for building domain-dependent sentiment resource.",
        "Our proposal is compounded of four phases.",
        "(See figure 1).",
        "Firstly, review pages about the product of interest can be retrieved from different websites, for instance, Ciao, Epinions and Cnet (in this work we only use reviews from Ciao).",
        "This reviews are parsed and cleaned (this time we use Python XML Parser 6 ).",
        "For each page we extract: pros, cons, title, full review and rating.",
        "In this work we have only focus on the pros and cons attributes because they are usually very brief, consist of short phrases or sentence segments and give a positive and negative evaluation about the product aspects.",
        "Each pros and cons in remainder paper will be considered as positive and negative samples, respectively.",
        "6 https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.html 774 Figure 1: Building domain-dependent sentiment resource.",
        "Subsequently, the samples are preprocessed, applying a POS-Tagging tool (Padr?o and Stanilovsky, 2012) to convert all words in lemmas.",
        "After that, the stopwords are removed from text.",
        "Afterward each sample is represented using the classic vector space model (Salton et al., 1975).",
        "Intending to measure the association between term and class we add a special term to the vectors.",
        "In positive samples the term t pos is added whereas in the negative samples the term t neg is aggregated.",
        "Later, we apply a Latent Semantic Analysis (this time we use, Gensim python package) to calculate the strength of the semantic association between words and classes.",
        "LSA uses the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to analyze the statistical relationships among words in a corpus.",
        "The first step is construct a matrix M n?m , in which the row vectors v i represent lemmas and the column vectors s i the positive and negative sample (pros and cons).",
        "In each cell t ij , we have the TF score (Term Frequency) of the i th lemma in j th sample.",
        "The next step is apply Singular Value Decomposition to matrix M n?m to decompose it into a product of three matrices U?V T , then, we select the k largest singular values, and their corresponding singular vectors from U and V , obtained an approximation ?",
        "M = U k ?",
        "k V T k of rank k to original matrix M n?m .",
        "After LSA is performed, we use the new matrix ?",
        "M to measure the association between lemmas l i and l j computing the cosine measure between vectors v i and v j , with the equation 1.",

        "?",
        "?",
        "v j ?",
        "(1) Finally, the polarity lexicon contains lemmas l i and its positive and negative scores.",
        "This values are computed using LSA score (l i , t pos ) and LSA score (l i , t neg ) respectively.",
        "The table 1 show some top positive and negative words computed with this strategy.",

        "With aim to do our contribution to SemEval-2014, Task 4: Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (Pontiki et al., 2014), Subtask 2: Aspect Term Po-larity, we gathered 3010 Laptop Reviews, from Ciao and create a corpus with 6020 samples, 3010 positives (Pros) and 3010 negatives (Cons).",
        "This corpus was used as input in the developed framework (See figure 1).",
        "In this time we utilize Freel-ing 7 as POS-Tagging tool and Gensim Python Packages 8 to perform LSA (only the most 100 most significant eigenvalue are used).",
        "After that, a domain-dependent sentiment resource (DLSR) with 4482 term was created for Laptop reviews.",
        "2.2 Aspect Polarity Classification In order to exploit our domain-dependent sentiment resource building for Laptop domain, we develop an unsupervised method based on language rule to classify the product aspect.",
        "The basic rules are used to find dependency relation between aspect and their attributes.",

        "Following that, we extract a set of tuples W , each tuple is represented as a pair (Att,Mod) where Att is a word related with the aspect P feature through some dependency relations shown in Table 2, and Mod is a integer value indicating if Att is modified by a valence shifter (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2004), (we only consider negation words, e.g., never, no, not, don't, nothing, etc.)",
