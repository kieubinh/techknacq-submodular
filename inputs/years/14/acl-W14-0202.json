        "Dialog state tracking methods need to cope with such error-prone automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spoken language understanding (SLU) outputs.",
        "Traditional dialog systems use hand-crafted rules to select from the SLU outputs based on their confidence scores.",

        "It is assumed that the goal is fixed through the dialog, unless the user is informed that the requested goal does not exist.",
        "In DSTC the user's goal consist of nine slots: route, from.desc, from.neighborhood, from.monument, to.desc, to.neighborhood, to.monument, date, time.",
        "The dialog datasets in the DSTC are partitioned into five training sets and four test sets.",
        "Details and differences of the datasets are summarized in Table 1 and 2.",
        "The datasets come from dialog systems deployed by three teams denoted as A, B and C. All the training datasets were transcribed but only three of them were annotated on the level of dialog acts.",
        "The SLU confidence scores from system B are relatively well calibrated, meaning that confidences can be directly interpreted as probabilities of observing the SLU hypothesis.",
        "Confidence scores from the system A are not well calibrated as noted by several DSTC participants (Lee and Eskenazi, 2013; Kim et al., 2013).",
        "The evaluation protocol is briefly described in Section 6.",
        "Its detailed description can be found in (Williams et al., 2012), its evaluation in (Williams et al., 2013).",
        "In 2013, nine teams with 27 trackers participated in the challenge.",
        "The results of the best trackers will be discussed together with the results of our tracker later in Section 6.",
        "3 Related Work This section shortly reviews current approaches to dialog state tracking.",
        "We divide the trackers into two broad families of generative and discriminative methods.",
        "3.1 Generative Methods The HIS model (Young et al., 2010) introduces an approximative method of solving the belief tracking as an inference in a dynamic Bayesian network with SLU hypotheses and machine actions as observed variables and the estimate of the user's goal as a hidden variable.",
        "The HIS model was implemented several times (Williams, 2010; Ga?si?c, 2011).",
        "Recent criticism of generative methods for belief tracking brought more attention to the discriminative methods (Williams, 2012b).",
        "In the DSTC only few generative system participated.",
        "Kim et al. (2013) implemented the HIS model with additional discriminative rescoring, Wang and Lemon (2013) introduced a very simple model based on hand-crafted rules.",
        "Both of them scored between the second and the fourth place in the challenge.",
        "3.2 Discriminative Methods As was previously mentioned, the discriminative methods received more attention recently.",
        "The overall winner of the DSTC (Lee and Es-kenazi, 2013) used a maximum entropy model, which they claim to be outperformed by bringing more structure to the model by using the Conditional Random Fields (Lee, 2013).",
        "The same type of model is used also by Ren et al. (2013).",
        "Usage of Deep Neural Networks was tested by Henderson et al. (2013).",
        "?",
        "Zilka et al. (2013) compare a discriminative maximum entropy model and a generative method based on approximate inference in a Bayesian net-11 work, with the discriminative model preforming better.",
        "4 Model Our model is an implementation of the HIS model (Young et al., 2010).",
        "In HIS the belief state is viewed as a probability distribution over all possible user's goals.",
        "The belief state is represented by a set of so-called partitions, which are sets of user's goals that are indistinguishable based on actions the system observes.",
        "It means the probability mass assigned to a partition spreads to the user's goals in the partition proportionally to their's prior probabilities.",
        "The belief update is performed in two steps.",
        "Belief refinement ensures that for each user action on the SLU n-best list and each partition all goals in the partition are either consistent with the user action or not.",
        "This step does not change the belief state, it only enables the actual belief update to be computed using the update equation (Eq. 1).",
        "The partitions are organized in a tree structure for which it holds that a child and a parent partition are identical in some slots and complementary in the remaining ones.",
        "This is ensured by the belief refinement procedure.",
        "For each observed user action and each partition it first checks whether all of the hypotheses in the partition are either consistent with the action or not.",
        "If they are not, it splits the partition into two partitions with the parent-child relationship.",
        "The inconsistent hypotheses remain in the parent partition and the consistent ones are moved to the child.",
        "The belief of the original partition is distributed between the new ones in the ratio of their priors.",
        "To prevent an exponential increase in the number of partitions during the dialog, a partition recombination strategy can be used that removes the less probable partition and moves their hypotheses to different partitions.",
        "We perform partition recombination at the end of each turn (Henderson and Lemon, 2008), during the recombination low probability partitions are merged with their parents exactly as suggested by Williams (2010).",
        "For the actual belief update the following standard update equation is used: P t+1 (p) = k ?",

        "supports all partitions, not only those not supported by any observed action.",
        "The key property of the update equations formulated in this way is that the probability of a partition representing a hypothesis that a user's goal was not mentioned in any of the SLU lists up to the time t does not outweigh probability of observed goals even though the prior probability of unobserved hypothesis is usually orders of magnitude higher than the probability of all observed hypotheses.",
        "However, when two goals are indistinguishable based on the SLU input then the ratio of their probabilities will be exactly the ratio of their priors.",

        "We estimated prior probabilities as a mixture of the uniform probability and empirical distribution estimated on the training data.",
        "In the first experiment the empirical probabilities were estimated using the annotation that was available in the training data.",
        "We tracked the slots independently because the empirical joint distribution would be too sparse to generalize on the test data.",
        "We used one prior distribution to guide the selection of route hypotheses Pr route and one shared distribution for possible destination names Pr desc .",
        "This distribution is trained on data from both from and to destinations thus gaining a more robust estimate compared to using two separate distributions for from.desc and to.desc.",
        "This tracker will be denoted as IBM indep train-to-test .",
        "In the second experiment we used the test data without the ground truth labels to estimate the empirical prior.",
        "We first ran the tracker with the uniform prior on the testing set and we used the output hypotheses as a basis for the empirical distribution.",
        "The prior of a hypothesis is proportional to a sum of all tracker output scores for the hypothesis.",
        "This scheme is called unsupervised prior adaptation by Lee and Eskenazi (2013).",

        "Schedule 3 evaluates belief at the end of the dialog, i.e. at the moment when the queried information is presented to the user.",
        "We report accuracy, which is the ratio of dialogs where the user goal was correctly estimated, and 15 the L2 score, which is the Euclidean distance of the vector of the resulting belief from a vector having 1 for the correct hypothesis and 0s for the others.",
        "For both of these the average values over all tracked slot is reported as well as the value for the joint hypotheses.",
        "The accuracy informs us how often the correct query to the database will be made.",

        "Here both basic variants of the tracker IBM indep uniform and IBM jointly uniform perform almost identically.",
        "This is because test 3 uses fixed dialog flow as discussed in Section 2, minor differences in performance between IBM indep uniform and IBM jointly uniform are caused only by numerical issues.",
        "The trackers are around the third place in accuracy.",
        "In joint L2 metrics they outperform the best tracker in DSTC submitted by Team 6 (Lee and Eskenazi, 2013).",
        "Tracker utilizing database IBM jointly db does not show any significant improvement over the same tracker without database-based prior IBM jointly uniform .",
        "We hypothesize that this is because of the fact that people frequently asked for non-existing combinations of routes and stops, which were penalized for not being in the database, as discussed in Sec.",

        "Interesting results were achieved by IBM indep unsup that performed even better than the IBM indep train-to-test .",
        "It uses a prior trained on the test set by running the tracker with a uniform prior.",
        "The tracker was run for three iterations each time using output of the previous iteration as a new prior.",
        "After running the experiments with the top 5 SLU hypotheses, we performed an experiment that investigated influence of n-best list length on the tracker's accuracy.",
        "We evaluated five system variants that received 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 best SLU hypotheses.",
        "The overall trend was that initially performance increased as more SLU hypotheses were provided however then performance started decreasing.",
        "The 3-best variant achieved about 1.5% increase in joint accuracy compared to the 1-best.",
        "However, when using more than 3 best hypothe-ses, the performance slightly decreased.",
        "For in-stance, IBM indep uniform using 1-best hypothesis performed comparable to the 5-best configuration.",
        "Similar behavior of generative systems assuming observation independence has already been observed in different domains (Vail et al., 2007).",
        "Based on these results we deduce two conclusions.",
        "First, strong performance of IBM indep uniform 1-best system compared to the 1-best baseline system suggests that the main added value of our tracker in this domain is in the aggregation of observations from multiple time steps, not in tracking multiple hypotheses from one turn.",
        "Sec-ond, we attribute the effect of decreasing accuracy to the correlation of ASR errors from consecutive dialog turns.",
        "As noted by Williams (2012b), correlated ASR errors violate the assumption of observation independence that is assumed by HIS.",
        "Extending the user model with an auto-regressive component, that is with dependence on observations from the previous time step (i.e. P(u t |u t?1 , p, a)), might help to tackle this problem in generative models (Wellekens, 1987).",
        "To summarize the results on test set 3, even without any prior adaptation on the data our tracker is competitive with the best submissions to DSTC.",
        "After incorporating prior knowledge it outperforms all submitted trackers.",
        "On test set 1 and test set 2 (see Tables 5 and 6) the trackers perform second in accuracy.",
        "In L2 metrics the trackers are competitive with the best tracker in DSTC submitted by Team 6 and they outperform it in one out of four cases.",
        "It is interesting that our basic strategy that ignores live SLU scores performed that strong.",
        "However, on test 1 and test 2, which make it possible to input multiple slots in one user utter-ance, IBM jointly uniform outperforms IBM indep uniform , both in accuracy and L2.",
        "We hypothesize that this is because of effect of tracking joint distributions described in Section 5.1.",
        "Qualitative Comparison to DSTC Trackers.",
        "Compared to another HIS-based system (Kim et al., 2013) participating in the DSTC, our implementation does not suffer from the problem of assigning high probability to the hypothesis that the user goal was not observed so far.",
        "This might be due to our modified user model.",
        "Therefore our implementation does not need a final transformation of belief scores as reported by Kim et al. (2013).",
        "Additionally, our implementation does not exhibit the forgetting behavior as experienced by ?",
        "Zilka et al. (2013).",
        "Forgetting is undesirable given the validity of assumption that the user's goal remains fixed in the whole dialog, which is the case of DSTC bus schedule domains.",
        "7 Conclusion Although the use of generative trackers was recently criticized by Williams (2012a), our results show that at least in some metrics (e.g. L2 metrics on dataset 3) a generative tracker can outperform the best state-of-the-art discriminative tracker (Lee and Eskenazi, 2013).",
        "Even though we agree that the discriminative approach might be more promising, it seems that in general there are conditions where generative models learn faster than discriminative models (Ng and Jordan, 2001).",
        "Thus it might be beneficial to use a generative tracker for a newly deployed dialog system with only a few training dialogs available and switch to a discriminative model once enough training data from an already running system is collected.",
        "Ensemble trackers incorporating both generative and discriminative models as used by Lee and Eskenazi (2013) might also be an interesting direction for future research.",
