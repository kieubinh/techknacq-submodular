        "Currently the Machine Translation (MT) research community attempts to seamlessly integrate both humans and MT-instances in the workflow of textual translation.",
        "Efforts towards this integration focus, for instance, on automating a posteriori processes such as post-editing (Simard et al., 2007), or other format coherence maintenance (e.g. date, spelling).",
        "Our contribution addresses cases when a post-editor has to start a segment from scratch, because the MT raw output turns out to be a hindrance rather than an aid, and the corresponding evaluation time between editing and manually re-translating a sequence is wasted a posteriori.",
        "Reasons for unusable MT output in this context could potentially be a combination of the following or more factors, with reference to the target segment: ?",
        "the word order, or grammar, are such that the sentence structure is unintelligible ?",
        "the lexical semantics of the words do not convey the meaning of the source segment These lexical or structural factors can be present to various extents and their threshold of identification can be subjective for each post-editor, but hypothetically any intervention on the latter points is quantifiable in terms of post-editing time, being this the most observable aspect of post-editing effort (Krings, 2001).",
        "This paper proposes a supervised learning approach to discriminate typed grammar relation instances that compose a human-written sentence from any other form, in order to identify segments that can potentially lead to time loss on the basis of its incorrect grammar or word adjacency and delete them before post-editing.",
        "The remainder presents the project's assumptions and the nature of the adopted learning features (Section 2), the high-level algorithmic approach and the theory behind the adopted prediction models (Section 3).",
        "We then provide our implementation outline and the evaluation approaches (Section 4).",
        "In conclusion we present current limitations (Section 5), related and future work (Section 6), and the conclusions (Section 7).",
        "2 Concept We will now provide some background and a series of assertions as regards creating a classification method to estimate MT output grammar correctness, which mainly aims to support the post-editor in assessing which segments will take longer to post-edit than to translate from scratch.",
        "We assume the following post-editing behavioral phases: 1.",
        "Read source and/or target to various extents, in order to: ?",
        "check grammatical consistency of target ?",
        "check whether semantics have been conveyed between source and target 2.",
        "Insert or delete text accordingly 16 Given the lack of robust adequacy understanding methods (i.e. verifying meaning conveyance), we will perform analysis at a grammar and word order level, and for this we will seek a grammar-related formalism that is informative, scalable and robust to multiple, potentially unseen grammar instance variants.",
        "We therefore exploit typed dependencies (De Marneffe and Manning, 2008), a la-beled, directed grammar relationship among pairs of words, which provides information on the order of arguments and their relationship type.",

        "3 Algorithm Having discussed our aim and the required infor-mativeness, we present a pipeline for both training a hypothesis model and the prediction itself (Figure 2).",
        "The process comprises a typed dependency extraction module (M1) that, given a set of sentences from a test or training text, provides instances of grammar relationships in the form of two word arguments (arg1, arg2) and a type label (deptype), which we will adopt as features.",
        "In the training phase, a training module (M2) labels the feature data obtained from {trainHuman} instances as 1, and from {trainHuman \\ trainMT} as 0, where \\ is the set difference operator.",
        "We therefore consider any typed dependency instance that does not appear in the human reference text as ?bad?.",

        "More precisely, NB-based methods maximize likelihood conditioned only over the class label C, and not over the set of all other remaining features, and as a result its effectiveness is often outperformed by discriminative classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Crammer and Singer, 2002; Puurula, 2012).",
        "However, given its high efficiency and scalability, we will use NB as our primary model and compare it with an algorithm that has deeper modeling assumptions, but exploits inference approximation to reduce complexity, namely SVM with Stochastic Gradient Descent for parameter finding.",

        "4 Implementation & Evaluation As a proof-of-concept and means of evaluation, we constructed a Java prototype that implements the pipeline in Figure 2, by making use of the Moses process (Koehn et al., 2007) for machine translation, the Stanford Parser (De Marneffe and Manning, 2008) for typed dependency extraction, the API of the general-purpose machine learning analysis platform Weka (Hall et al., 2009) for training and prediction, and ad-hoc implementations of the remaining specified modules.",

        "Our Naive Bayes algorithm (using word frequencies, no pruning) required 1.08 seconds to formulate a hypothesis model, versus the 28613.64 seconds required for the construction of a Stochastic Gradient Descent model (hinge loss function for SVM, step length 0.01, 500 steps, no pruning).",
        "A 10-fold cross validation on the training set provided a correct instance classification of 67.0168% for NB model, versus the 66.0118% of the SGD model.",
