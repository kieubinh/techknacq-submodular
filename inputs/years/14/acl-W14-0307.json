        "Statistical machine translation (SMT) has made considerable progress over the past two decades.",
        "Numerous recent studies have shown productivity increases with post-editing of MT output over traditional work practices in human translation (e.g., Guerberof, 2009; Plitt and Masselot, 2010; Garcia, 2011; Pouliquen et al., 2011; Skadin?",
        "'s et al., 2011; den Bogaert and Sutter, 2013; Vazquez et al., 2013; Green et al., 2013; L?aubli et al., 2013).",
        "The advances in statistical machine translation over the past years have been driven to a large extent by frequent (friendly) competitive MT evaluation campaigns, such as the shared tasks at the ACL WMT workshop series (Bojar et al., 2013) and IWSLT (Cettolo et al., 2013), and the NIST Open MT Evaluation.",
        "1 These evaluations usually apply a mix of automatic evaluation metrics, most prominently the BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2001), and more subjective human evaluation criteria such as correctness, accuracy, and fluency.",
        "How the quality increases measured by automatic metrics and subjective evaluation criteria relate to actual increases in the productivity of post-editors is still an open research question.",
        "It is also not clear yet if some machine translation approaches ?",
        "say, syntax-based models ?",
        "are better suited for post-editing than others.",
        "These relationships may very well also depend on the lan-1 http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/openmt.cfm guage pair in question and the coarse level of MT quality, from barely good enough for post-editing to almost perfect.",
        "The pilot study presented in this paper investigates the influence of the underlying SMT system on post-editing effort and efficiency.",
        "The study focuses on translation of general news text from English into German, with translations created by non-professional post-editors working on output from four different translation systems.",
        "The data generated by this study is available for download.",
        "2 We find that the better systems lead to a productivity gain of roughly 20% and carry out in-depth analysis of editing behavior.",
        "A significant finding is the high variance in work styles between the different post-editors, compared to the impact of machine translation systems.",
        "2 Related Work Koponen (2012) examined the relationship between human assessment of post-editing efforts and objective measures such as post-editing time and number of edit operations.",
        "She found that segments that require a lot of reordering are perceived as being more difficult, and that long sentences are considered harder, even if only few words changed.",
        "She also reports larger variance between translators in post-editing time than in post-editing operations ?",
        "a finding that we confirm here as well.",
        "From a detailed analysis of the types of edits performed in sentences with long versus short post-edit times, Koponen et al. (2012) conclude that the observed differences in edit times can be explained at least in part also by the types of necessary edits and the associated cognitive effort.",
        "Deleting superfluous function words, for exam-ple, appears to be cognitively simple and takes little time, whereas inserting translations for untranslated words requires more cognitive effort 2 http://www.casmacat.eu/index.php?n=Main.Downloads 38 Table 1: News stories used in the study (size is given in number of sentences) Source Size Title BBC 49 Norway's rakfisk: Is this the world's smelliest fish?",

        "They also compare post-editing styles of different post-editors working on identical post-editing tasks.",
        "Another study by Koponen (2013) showed that inter-translator variance is lower in a controlled language setting when translators are given the choice of output from three different machine translation systems.",
        "In the realm of machine translation research, there has been an increasing interest in the use of MT technology by post-editors.",
        "A major push are the two EU-funded research projects MATE-CAT 3 and CASMACAT 4 , which are developing an open source translation and post-editing workbench (Federico et al., 2012; Alabau et al., 2013).",
        "At this point, we are not aware of any study that compares directly the impact of different machine translation systems on post-editor productivity and behaviour.",
        "3 Experimental Design We thus carried out an experiment on an English?",
        "German news translation task, using output from four different SMT systems, post-edited by fluent bilingual native speakers of German with no prior experience in professional translation.",
        "3.1 The Translation Task The Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (Bojar et al., 2013) organises an annual evaluation campaign for machine translation systems.",
        "The subject matter is translation of news stories from sources such as the New York Times or the BBC.",
        "We decided to use output from systems submitted to this evaluation campaign, not only because 3 http://www.matecat.com/ 4 http://www.casmacat.eu/ their output is freely available, 5 but also because it comes with automatic metric scores and human judgements of the translation quality.",
        "The translation direction we chose was English?German, partly due to convenience (the authors of this study are fluent in both languages), but also because this language pair poses special challenges to current machine translation technol-ogy, due to the syntactic divergence of the two languages.",
        "We selected data from the most recent evaluation campaign.",
        "The subset chosen for our post-editing task comprises 9 different news stories, originally written in English, with a total of 500 sentences.",
        "Details are shown in Table 1.",
        "3.2 Machine Translation Systems A total of 15 different machine translation systems participated in the evaluation campaign.",
        "We selected four different systems that differ in their architecture and use of training data: ?",
        "an anonymized popular online translation system built by a large Internet company (ONLINE-B) ?",
        "the syntax-based translation system of the University of Edinburgh (UEDIN-SYNTAX; Nadejde et al., 2013) ?",
        "the phrase-based translation system of the University of Edinburgh (UEDIN-PHRASE; Durrani et al., 2013) ?",
        "the machine translation system of the University of Uppsala (UU; Stymne et al., 2013) In the 2013 WMT evaluation campaign, the systems translated a total of 3000 sentences, and their 5 http://www.statmt.org/wmt13/results.html 39 Table 2: Machine translation systems used in the study, with quality scores in the WMT 2013 evaluation campaign.",
        "System BLEU SUBJECTIVE ONLINE-B 20.7 0.637 UEDIN-SYNTAX 19.4 0.614 UEDIN-PHRASE 20.1 0.571 UU 16.1 0.361 output was judged with the BLEU score against a professional reference translation and by subjective ranking.",
        "The scores obtained for the different systems on the full test set are shown in Table 2.",
        "The first three systems are fairly close in quality (although the differences in subjective human judgement scores are statistically significant), whereas the fourth system (UU) clearly lags behind.",
        "The best system ONLINE-B was ranked first according to human judgement and thus can be considered state of the art.",
        "From casual observation, the syntax-based system UEDIN-SYNTAX succeeds more frequently in producing grammatically correct translations.",
        "The phrase-based system UEDIN-PHRASE, even though trained on the same parallel data, has higher coverage since it does not have the requirement that translation rules have to match syntactic constituents in the target language, which we presume is the main cause behind the lower BLEU score.",
        "The two systems use the same language model.",
        "System UU is also a phrase based system, with a decoder that is able to consider the document level context.",
        "It was trained on smaller corpora for both the translation model and the language model.",
        "We do not have any insight into the system ONLINE-B, but we conjecture that it is a phrase-based system with syntactic pre-reordering trained on much larger data sets, but not optimised towards the news domain.",
        "Notice the inconsistency between BLEU score and subjective score for the two systems from the University of Edinburgh.",
        "Results from other evaluations have also shown (Callison-Burch et al., 2012) that current automatic evaluation metrics do not as much as human judges appreciate the strengths of the syntax-based system, which builds syntactic structures in the target language during translation.",
        "Hence, we were particularly interested how the syntax-based system fares with post-editors.",
        "As mentioned above, the nine documents chosen for the post-editing task analysed in this paper (cf. Table 1) were part of the WMT 2013 evaluation data set.",
        "All nine documents had English as the original source language.",
        "3.3 Post-Editors We recruited four English-German bilingual, native German post-editors.",
        "Three were students, staff, or faculty at the University of Edinburgh; the fourth had been previously employed on a contractual basis for linguistic annotation work.",
        "6 The post-editors had no professional experience with translation, and differed in language skills.",
        "3.4 Assignment of MT Output The goal of this study was to investigate how post-editors?",
        "behaviour and productivity are influenced by the quality of the underlying machine translation system.",
        "Ideally, we would want to present output from different systems to the same post-editor and see how their observable behaviour changes.",
        "However, a post-editor who has seen the output from one MT system for a sentence will be at an advantage when post-editing the output from a second system, by having already spent significant time understanding the source sentence and considering the best translation choices.",
        "Hence we used 4 different post-editors, each to post-edit the output in equal amounts from each of the 4 machine translation systems under investiga-tion, so that each post-editor worked on each sentence once and the entire output from all systems was post-edited once by one of the 4 post-editors.",
        "A concern in this setup is that we never know if we measure differences in post-editors or differences in machine translations systems when comparing the behaviour for any given sentence.",
        "Therefore, each post-editor was assigned a translation for each sentence randomly from any of the machine translation systems.",
        "This random assignment allows us to marginalise out the dependence on the post-editor when assessing statistics for the different systems.",
        "6 The ordering here does not reflect the order of post-editors in the discussion later in this paper.",
        "40 Table 3: Post-editing speed by editor and system.",
        "System seconds / word words / hour 1 2 3 4 mean 1 2 3 4 mean ONLINE-B 2.95 4.69 9.16 4.98 5.46 1,220 768 393 723 659 UEDIN-PHRASE 3.04 5.01 9.22 4.70 5.45 1,184 719 390 766 661 UEDIN-SYNTAX 3.03 4.41 9.20 4.97 5.38 1,188 816 391 724 669 UU 3.11 5.01 11.59 5.58 6.35 1,158 719 311 645 567 mean per editor 3.03 4.78 9.79 5.05 1,188 753 368 713 4 Productivity The primary argument for post-editing machine translation output as opposed to more traditional approaches is the potential gain in productivity.",
        "If translation professionals can work faster with machine translation, then this has real economic benefits.",
        "There are also other considerations, for example that post-editing might be done by professionals that are less skilled in the source language (Koehn, 2010).",
        "We measure productivity by time spent on each sentence.",
        "This is not a perfect measure.",
        "When working on a news story, post-editors tend to speed up when moving down the story since they have already solved some reoccurring translation problems and get more familiar with the context.",
        "4.1 Productivity by MT System Our main interests is the average translation speed, broken down by machine translation system.",
        "The columns labelled ?mean?",
        "in Table 3 show the results.",
        "While the differences are not big for the top three systems, the syntax-based system comes out on top.",
        "We used bootstrap resampling to test the speed differences for statistical significance.",
        "Only system UU is significantly worse than the others (at p-level < 0.01), with about 20% lower productivity.",
        "4.2 Productivity by Post-Editor Post-editing speed is very strongly influenced by the post-editor's skill and effort.",
        "Our post-editors were very diverse, showing large differences in translation speed.",
        "See the columns labelled 1 to 4 in Table 3 for details.",
        "In particular, post-editor 3 took more than three times as much time as the fastest (PE 1).",
        "According to a post-study interview with Post-Editor 3, there were two reasons for this.",
        "First, the post-editor was feeling a bit ?under the weather?",
        "during the study and found it hard to focus.",
        "Second, (s)he found the texts very difficult to translate and struggled with idiomatic expressions and cultural references that (s)he did not understand immediately.",
        "4.3 Productivity by System and Post-Editor While the large differences between the post-editors are unfortunate when the goal is consistency in results, they provide some data on how post-editors of different skill levels are influenced by the quality of the machine translation systems.",
        "Table 3 breaks down translation speed by machine translation system and post-editor.",
        "Interest-ingly, machine translation quality has hardly any effect on the fast Post-Editor 1, and the lower MT performance of system UU affects only Post-Editors 3 and 4.",
        "Post-Editor 2 is noticeably faster with UEDIN-SYNTAX ?",
        "an effect that cannot be observed for the other post-editors.",
        "The differences between the other systems are not large for any of the post-editors.",
        "Statistically significant ?",
        "as determined by bootstrap resampling ?",
        "are only the differences in post-editing speed for Post-Editor 3 with system UU versus ONLINE-B and UEDIN-PHRASE at p-level < 0.01, and against UEDIN-SYNTAX at p-level <0.02, and for Post-Editor 4 for UU versus UEDIN-PHRASE at p-level < 0.05.",
        "Note that the absence of statistical significance in our data has much to do with the small sample size; more extensive experiments may be necessary to ensure more solid findings.",
        "5 Translation Edit Rate Given the inherent difficulties in obtaining timing information, we can also measure the impact of machine translation system quality on post-editing effort in terms of how much the post-editors change the machine translation output, as done, for example in Cettolo et al. (2013).",

        "One way is to compare the final translation with the original machine translation output.",
        "This is what we will do in this section.",
        "In Section 6, we will consider which parts of the final translation were actually changed by the post-editor and discuss the difference.",
        "5.1 HTER as Quality Measure The edit distance between machine translation output and human reference translation can be measured in the number of insertions, deletions, substitutions and (phrasal) moves.",
        "A metric that simply counts the minimal number of such edit operations and divides it by the length of the human reference translation is the translation edit rate, short TER (Snover et al., 2006).",
        "If the human reference translation is created from the machine translation output to minimise the number of edit operations needed for an acceptable translation, this variant is called human-mediated TER, or HTER.",
        "Note that in our experiment the post-editors are not strictly trying to minimise the number of edit operations ?",
        "they may be inclined to make additional changes due to arbitrary considerations of style or perform edits that are faster rather than minimise the number of operations (e.g., deleting whole passages and rewriting them).",
        "5.2 Edits by MT System Table 4 shows the HTER scores ?",
        "keep in mind our desiderata above ?",
        "for the four systems.",
        "The scores are similar to the productivity number, with the three leading systems close together and the trailing system UU well behind.",
        "Notably, we draw more statistically significant distinctions here.",
        "While as above, UU is significantly worse than all other systems (p-level < 0.01), we also find that ONLINE-B is better than UEDIN-PHRASE (p-level < 0.01).",
        "Hence, HTER is a more sensitive metric than translation speed.",
        "This may be due to the fact that the time measurements are noisier than the count of edit operations.",
        "But it may also because HTER and productivity (i.e., time) do not measure the exactly the same thing.",
        "For instance, edits that require only a few keystrokes may be cognitively demanding (e.g., terminological choices), and thus take more time.",
        "We cannot make any strong claim based on our numbers, but it is worth pointing out that post-editing UEDIN-SYNTAX was slightly faster than ONLINE-B (by 0.08 seconds/word), while the HTER score is lower (by 1 point).",
        "A closer look at the edit operations reveals that the post-edit of UEDIN-SYNTAX output required slightly fewer short and long shifts (movements of phrases), but more substitutions.",
        "Intuitively, moving a phrase around is a more time-consuming task than replacing a word.",
        "The benefit of a syntax-based system that aims to produce correct syntactic structure (including word order), may have real benefits in terms of post-editing time.",
        "5.3 Edits by Post-Editor Table 5 displays the edit rate broken down by post-editor.",
        "There is little correlation between edit rate and post-editor speed.",
        "While the fastest Post-Editor 1 produces translations with the smallest edit rate, the difference to two of the others (in- cluded the slowest Post-Editor 3) is not large.",

        "Table 7 shows the numbers for each machine translation system.",
        "The suspicion from the HTER score that the syntax-based system UEDIN-SYNTAX requires less movement is not confirmed by these numbers.",

        "In general, cutting and pasting is not as common as the HTER score would suggest: the two types of shifts moved 10.3% and 10.2% of phrases, respectively.",
        "It seems that most words that could be moved are rather deleted and typed again.",
        "6.3 Behaviour By Post-Editor The post-editors differ significantly in their be-haviour, as the numbers in Table 8 illustrate.",
        "Post-Editor 1, who is the fastest, leaves the most characters unchanged (72.9% vs. 57.7?64.4% for the others).",

        "end pause: the pause at the end of the trans-lation, if it exists ?",
        "short pause of length 2?6 seconds ?",
        "medium pauses of length 6?60 seconds ?",
        "big pauses longer than 60 seconds ?",
        "various working activities (in our case just typing and mouse actions) When we break up the time spent on each activity and normalise it by the number of words in the original machine translation output, we get the numbers in Table 9, per machine translation system and post-editor.",
        "The worse quality of the UU system causes mainly more work activity, big medium pauses.",
        "Each contributes roughly 0.3 seconds per word.",
        "The syntax-based system UEDIN-SYNTAX may pose fewer hard translation problems (showing up in initial and big pauses) than the HTER-preferred ONLINE-B system, but the effect is not strong.",
        "We noted that ONLINE-B has a statistically significant better HTER score than UEDIN-PHRASE.",
        "While this is reflected in the additional working activity for the latter (2.41 sec./word vs. 2.26 sec./word), time is made up in the pauses.",
        "Our data is not sufficiently conclusive to gain any deeper insight here ?",
        "it is certainly a question that we want to explore in the future.",
        "The difference in post-editors mirrors some of the earlier findings: The number of characters and words changed leads to longer working activity, but the slow Post-Editor 3 is mainly slowed down by initial, big and medium pauses, indicating difficulties with solving translation problems, and not slow cutting and pasting actions.",
        "The faster Post-Editor 1 rarely pauses long and is quick with typing and mouse movements.",

        "The latter allowed us to draw more statistically significant conclusions, but may measure something distinct.",
        "Productivity is the main concern of commercial use of post-editing machine translation, and we find that better machine translation leads to less time spent on editing, but more importantly, less time spent of figuring out harder translation problems (indicated by pauses of more than six sec-onds).",
        "Finally, an important finding is that the differences between post-editors is much larger than the difference between machine translation systems.",
