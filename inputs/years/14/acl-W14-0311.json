        "This paper describes the end-to-end machine translation post-editing setup provided by cdec Realtime and TransCenter.",
        "As the quality of MT systems continues to improve, the idea of using automatic translation as a primary technology in assisting human translators has become increasingly attractive.",
        "Recent work has explored the possibilities of integrating MT into human translation workflows by providing MT-generated translations as a starting point for translators to cor-rect, as opposed to translating source sentences from scratch.",
        "The motivation for this process is to dramatically reduce human translation effort while improving translator productivity and consistency.",
        "This computer-aided approach is directly applicable to the wealth of scenarios that still require precise human-quality translation that MT is currently unable to deliver, including an ever-increasing number of government, commercial, and community-driven projects.",
        "The software described in the following sections enables users to translate documents with the assistance of an adaptive MT system using a web-based interface.",
        "The system learns from user feedback, improving translation quality as users work.",
        "All user interaction is logged, allowing post-editing sessions to be replayed and analyzed.",
        "All software is freely available under an open source license, allowing anyone to easily build, deploy, and evaluate MT systems specifically for post-editing.",
        "We first describe the underlying adaptive MT paradigm (?2) and the Realtime implementation (?3).",
        "We then describe TransCenter (?4) and the results of an end-to-end post-editing experiment with human translators (?5).",
        "All data collected as part of this validation experiment is also publicly available.",
        "2 Adaptive Machine Translation Traditional machine translation systems operate in batch mode: statistical translation models are estimated from large volumes of sentence-parallel bilingual text and then used to translate new text.",
        "Incorporating new data requires a full system re-build, an expensive operation taking up to days of time.",
        "As such, MT systems in production scenarios typically remain static for large periods of time (months or even indefinitely).",
        "Recently, an adaptive MT paradigm has been introduced specifically for post-editing (Denkowski et al., 2014).",
        "Three major MT system components are extended to support online updates, allowing human post-editor feedback to be immediately incorporated: ?",
        "An online translation model is updated to include new translations extracted from post-editing data.",
        "?",
        "A dynamic language model is updated to include post-edited target language text.",
        "?",
        "An online update is made to the system's feature weights after each sentence is post-edited.",
        "72 These extensions allow the MT system to generate improved translations that require significantly less effort to correct for later sentences in the document.",
        "This paradigm is now implemented in the freely available cdec (Dyer et al., 2010) machine translation toolkit as Realtime, part of the pycdec (Chahuneau et al., 2012) Python API.",
        "Standard MT systems use aggregate statistics from all training text to learn a single large translation grammar (in the case of cdec's hierarchical phrase-based model (Chiang, 2007), a synchronous context-free grammar) consisting of rules annotated with feature scores.",
        "As an alter-native, the bitext can be indexed using a suffix array (Lopez, 2008), a data structure allowing fast source-side lookups.",
        "When a new sentence is to be translated, training sentences that share spans of text with the input sentence are sampled from the suffix array.",
        "Statistics from the sample are used to learn a small, sentence-specific grammar on-the-fly.",
        "The adaptive paradigm extends this approach to support online updates by also indexing the new bilingual sentences generated as a post-editor works.",
        "When a new sentence is translated, matching sentences are sampled from the post-editing data as well as the suffix array.",
        "All feature scores that can be computed on a suffix array sample can be identically computed on the combined sample, allowing uniform handling of all data.",
        "An additional ?post-edit support?",
        "feature is included that indicates whether a grammar rule was extracted from the post-editing data.",
        "This allows an optimizer to learn to prefer translations that originate from human feedback.",
        "This adaptation approach also serves as a platform for exploring expanded post-editing-aware feature sets; any feature that can be computed from standard text can be added to the model and will automatically include post-editing data.",
        "Implementationally, feature scoring is broken out into a single Python source file containing a single function for each feature score.",
        "New feature functions can be added easily.",
        "The adaptive paradigm uses two language models.",
        "A standard (static) n-gram language model estimated on large monolingual text allows the system to prefer translations more similar to human-generated text in the target language.",
        "A (dy- namic) Bayesian n-gram language model (Teh, 2006) can be updated with observations of the post-edited output in a straightforward way.",
        "This smaller model exactly covers the training bitext and all post-editing data, letting the system up-weight translations with newly learned vocabulary and phrasing absent in the large monolingual text.",
        "Finally, the margin-infused relaxed algorithm (MIRA) (Crammer et al., 2006; Eidelman, 2012) is used to make an online parameter update after each sentence is post-edited, minimizing model error.",
        "This allows the system to continuously rescale weights for translation and language model features that adapt over time.",
        "Since true post-editing data is infeasible to collect during system development and internal test-ing, as standard MT pipelines require tens of thousands of sentences to be translated with low la-tency, a simulated post-editing paradigm (Hardt and Elming, 2010) can be used, wherein pre-generated reference translations act as a stand-in for actual post-editing.",
        "This approximation is effective for tuning and internal evaluation when real post-editing data is unavailable.",
        "In simulated post-editing tasks, decoding (for both the test corpus and each pass over the development corpus during optimization) begins with baseline models trained on standard bilingual and monolingual text.",
        "After each sentence is translated, the following take place in order: First, MIRA uses the new source?reference pair to update weights for the current models.",
        "Second, the source is aligned to the reference using word-alignment models learned from the initial data and used to update the translation grammar.",
        "Third, the reference is added to the Bayesian language model.",
        "As sentences are translated, the models gain valuable context infor-mation, allowing them to adapt to the specific target document and translator.",
        "Context is reset at the start of each development or test corpus.",
        "Systems optimized with simulated post-editing can then be deployed to serve real human translators without further modification.",
        "3 cdec Realtime Now included as part of the free, open source cdec machine translation toolkit (Dyer et al., 2010), Realtime 1 provides an efficient implementation of the adaptive MT paradigm that can serve an arbitrary number of unique post-editors concurrently.",

        "2 Building an adaptive system begins with the usual MT pipeline steps: word alignment, bitext indexing (for suffix array grammar extrac-tion), and standard n-gram language model estimation.",
        "Additionally, the cpyp 3 package, also freely available, is used to estimate a Bayesian n-gram language model on the target side of the bitext.",
        "The cdec grammar extractor and dynamic language model implementations both include support for efficient inclusion of incremental data, allowing optimization with simulated post-editing to be parallelized.",
        "The resulting system, optimized for post-editing, is then ready for deployment with Realtime.",
        "At runtime, a Realtime system operates as follows.",
        "A single instance of the indexed bitext is loaded into memory for grammar extraction.",
        "Single instances of the directional word alignment models are loaded into memory for force-aligning post-edited data.",
        "When a new user requests a translation, a new context is started.",
        "The following are loaded into memory: a table of all post-edited data from the user, a user-specific dynamic language model, and a user-specific decoder (in this case an instance of MIRA that has a user-specific decoder and set of weights).",
        "Each user also requires an instance of the large static language model, though all users effectively share a single instance through the memory mapped implementation of KenLM (Heafield, 2011).",

        "The sentence is then decoded using the user and time-specific grammar, current weights, and current dynamic language model.",
        "When a post-edited sentence is available as feedback, the following happen in order: (1) the source-reference pair is used to update feature weights with MIRA, (2) the source-reference pair is force-aligned and added to the indexed post-editing data, and (3) the dynamic language model is updated with the reference.",
        "User state (current weights and indexed post-edited data for grammars and the language model) can be saved and loaded, allowing models to be loaded and freed from memory as translators start and stop their work.",
        "Figure 1 shows a minimal example of the above using the Realtime package.",
        "While this paper describes integration with TransCenter, a tool primarily targeting data collection and analysis, the Realtime Python API allows straightforward integration with other computer-assisted translation tools such as full-featured translation workbench environments.",

        "Translators use a web browser to access a familiar two-column editing environment (shown in Figure 2) from any computer with an Internet connection.",
        "The left column displays the source sentences, while the right col-umn, initially empty, is incrementally populated with translations from the Realtime system as the user works.",
        "For each sentence, the translator edits the MT output to be grammatically correct and convey the same information as the source sentence.",
        "During editing, all user actions (key presses and mouse clicks) are logged so that the full editing process can be replayed and analyzed.",
        "After editing, the final translation is reported to the Realtime system for learning and the next translation is generated.",
        "The user is additionally asked to rate the amount of work required to post-edit each sentence immediately after completing it, yielding maximally accurate feedback.",
        "The rating scale ranges from 5 (no post-editing required) to 1 (requires total re-translation).",
        "TransCenter also records the number of seconds each sentence is focused, allowing for exact timing measurements.",
        "A pause button is available if the translator needs to take breaks.",
        "TransCenter can generate reports 4 https://github.com/mjdenkowski/ transcenter-live of translator effort as measured by (1) keystroke, (2) exact timing, and (3) actual translator post-assessment.",

        "Millisecond-level timing of all user actions further facilitates time sequence analysis of user actions and pauses.",
        "Figure 3 shows an example summary report generated by TransCenter showing a user's activity on each sentence in a document.",
        "This information is also output in a simple comma-separated value format for maximum interoperability with other standards-compliant tools.",
        "TransCenter automatically handles resource management with Realtime.",
        "When a TransCenter server is started, it loads a Realtime system with zero contexts into memory.",
        "As users log in to work on documents, new contexts are created to deliver on-demand translations.",
        "As users finish working or take extended breaks, contexts automatically time out and resources are freed.",
        "Translator and document-specific state is automatically saved when contexts time out and reloaded when translators resume work with built-in safeguards against missing or duplicating any post-editing data due to timeouts or Internet connectivity issues.",
        "This allows any number of translators to work on translation tasks at their convenience.",

        "Translations are provided by either the static or fully adaptive system.",
        "Tasks are divided such that each user translates 2 excerpts with the static system and 2 with the adaptive system and each excerpt is post-edited either 2 or 3 times with each system.",
        "Users do not know which system is providing the translations.",
