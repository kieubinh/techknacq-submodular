        "Abstract",
        "A hot task in the Computer Assisted Translation scenario is the integration of Machine Translation (MT) systems that adapt sentence after sentence to the post-edits made by the translators.",
        "A main role in the MT online adaptation process is played by the information extracted from source and post-edited sentences, which in turn depends on the quality of the word alignment between them.",
        "In fact, this step is particularly crucial when the user corrects the MT output with words for which the system has no prior information.",
        "In this paper, we first discuss the application of popular state-of-the-art word aligners to this scenario and reveal their poor performance in aligning unknown words.",
        "Then, we propose a fast procedure to refine their outputs and to get more reliable and accurate alignments for unknown words.",
        "We evaluate our enhanced word-aligner on three language pairs, namely English-Italian, English-French, and English-Spanish, showing a consistent improvement in aligning unknown words up to 10% absolute F-measure."

        "In the adaptive MT the goal is to let the MT system take as soon and as much as possible advantage of user feedback, in order to learn from corrections and to hence avoid repeating the same mistakes in future sentences.",
        "A typical application scenario is the usage by a professional translator of a Computer Assisted Translation (CAT) tool enhanced with a SMT system.",
        "For each input sentence, first the translator receives one or more translation suggestions from either a Translation Memory or a SMT system, then (s)he chooses which suggestion is more use-ful, and finally (s)he creates an approved translation by post-editing.",
        "The pair of input sentence and post-edit is a valuable feedback to improve the quality of next suggestions.",
        "While the sentence pair is trivially added to the Translation Memory, how to exploit it for improving the SMT system is far to be a solved problem, but rather is a hot and quite recent topic in the MT community.",
        "In online MT adaptation specific issues have to be addressed, which distinguish it from the more standard and investigated task of domain adaptation.",
        "First of all, the SMT system should adapt very quickly, because the time between two consecutive requests are usually short, and very pre-cisely, because the translator is annoyed by correcting the same error several time.",
        "Then, a crucial point is which and how information is extracted from the feedback, and how it is exploited to update the SMT system.",
        "Finally, model updating relies on a little feedback consisting of just one sentence pair.",
        "In this work we focus on the word alignment task which is the first and most important step in extracting information from the given source and its corresponding post-edit.",
        "In particular, we are interested in the cases where the given sentence pairs contain new words, for which no prior information is available.",
        "This is an important and challenging problem in the online scenario, in which the user interacts with the system and expects that it learns from the previous corrections and does not repeat the same errors again and again.",
        "Unfortunately, state-of-the-art word-aligners show poor generalization capability and are prone to errors when infrequent or new words occur in the sentence pair.",
        "Word alignment errors at this stage could cause the extraction of wrong phrase pairs, i.e. wrong translation alternatives, which can lead in producing wrong translations for those 84 words, if they appear in the following sentences.",
        "Our investigation focuses on how to quickly build a highly precise word alignment from a source sentence and its translation.",
        "Moreover, we are interested in improving the word alignment of unknown terms, i.e. not present in the training data, because they are one of the most important source of errors in model updating.",
        "Although we are working in the online MT adaptation framework, our proposal is worthwhile per se; indeed, having an improved and fast word aligner can be useful for other interesting tasks, like for instance terminology extraction, translation error detection, and pivot translation.",
        "In Section 2 we report on some recent approaches aiming at improving word alignment.",
        "In Section 3, we describe three widely used toolk-its, highlight their pros and cons in the online MT adaptation scenario, and compare their performance in aligning unknown terms.",
        "In Section 4 we propose a standalone module which refines the word alignment of unknown words; moreover, we present an enhanced faster implementation of the best performing word aligner, to make it usable in the online scenario.",
        "In Section 5 we show experimental results of this module on three different languages.",
        "Finally, we draw some final comments in Section 6.",
        "2 Related works Hardt et al. (2010) presented an incremental retraining method which simulates the procedure of learning from post-edited MT outputs (refer- ences), in a real time fashion.",
        "By dividing the learning task into word alignment and phrase extraction tasks, and replacing the standard word-alignment module, which is a variation of EM algorithm (Och and Ney, 2003), with a greedy search algorithm, they attempt to find a quick approximation of the word alignments of the newly translated sentence.",
        "They also use some heuristics to improve the obtained alignments, without supporting it with some proofs or even providing some experimental results.",
        "Furthermore, the running time of this approach is not discussed, and it is not clear how effective this approach is in online scenarios.",
        "Blain et al. (2012) have recently studied the problem of incremental learning from post-editing data, with minimum computational complexity and acceptable quality.",
        "They use the MT output (hypothesis) as a pivot to find the word alignments between the source sentence and its corresponding reference.",
        "Similarly to (Hardt and Elm-ing, 2010), once the word alignment between the source and post-edit sentence pair is generated, they use the standard phrase extraction method to extract the parallel phrase pairs.",
        "This work is based on an implicit assumption that MT output is reliable enough to make a bridge between source and reference.",
        "However, in the real world this is not always true.",
        "The post-editor sometimes makes a lot of changes in the MT output, or even translates the entire sentence from scratch, which makes the post-edit very different from the automatic translation.",
        "Moreover, in the presence of new words in the source sentence, the MT system either does not produce any translation for the new word, or directly copies it in the output.",
        "Due to the above two reasons, there will be missing alignments between the automatic translation and post-edit, which ultimately results in incomplete paths from source to post-edit.",
        "But, the goal here is to accurately align the known words, as well as learning the alignments of the new words, which is not feasible by this approach.",
        "In order to improve the quality of the word alignments McCarley et al. (2011) proposed a trainable correction model which given a sentence pair and their corresponding automatically produced word alignment, it tries to fix the wrong alignment links.",
        "Similar to the hill-climbing approach used in IBM models 3-5 (Brown et al., 1993), this approach iteratively performs small modifications in each step, based on the changes of the previous step.",
        "However, the use of additional sources of knowledge, such as POS tags of the words and their neighbours, helps the system to take more accurate decisions.",
        "But, requiring manual word alignments for learning the alignment moves makes this approach only applicable for a limited number of language pairs for which manual aligned gold references are available.",
        "Tomeh et al. (2010) introduced a supervised discriminative word alignment model for producing higher quality word alignments, which is trained on a manually aligned training corpus.",
        "To reduce the search space of the word aligner, they propose to provide the system with a set of automatic word alignments and consider the union of these alignments as the possible search space.",
        "This transforms the word alignment process into 85 the alignment refinement task in which given a set of automatic word alignments, the system tries to find the best word alignment points.",
        "Similar to (McCarley et al., 2011), this approach relies on the manually annotated training corpora which is not available for most of the language pairs.",
        "3 Word Alignment Word alignment is the task of finding the correspondence among the words of a sentence pair (Figure 1).",
        "From a mathematical point of view, it is a relation among the words, because any word in a sentence can be mapped into zero, one or more words of the other, and vice-versa; in other words, any kind of link is allowed, namely one-to-one, many-to-one, many-to-many, as well as leaving words unaligned.",
        "So called IBM models 1-5 (Brown et al., 1993) as well as the HMM-based alignment models (Vogel et al., 1996), and their variations are extensively studied and widely used for this task.",
        "They are directional alignment mod-els, because permit only many-to-one links; but often the alignments in the two opposite directions are combined in a so-called symmetrized align-ment, which is obtained by intersection, union or other smart combination.",
        "Nowadays, word-aligners are mostly employed in an intermediate step of the training procedure of a SMT system; In this step, the training corpus is word aligned as a side effect of the estimation of the alignment models by means of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm.",
        "For this task, they perform sufficiently well, because the training data are often very large, and the limited amount of alignment errors do not have strong impact on the estimation of the translation model.",
        "Instead, the already trained word-aligners are rarely applied for aligning new sentence pairs.",
        "In this task their performance are often not satisfac-tory, due to their poor generalization capability; they are especially prone to errors when infrequent or new words occur in the sentence pair.",
        "This is the actual task to be accomplished in the online adaptive scenario: as soon as a new source and post-edited sentence pair is available, it has to be word aligned quickly and precisely.",
        "In this scenario, the sentence pair likely does not belong to the training corpus, hence might contain infrequent or new words, for which the aligner has little or no prior information.",
        "3.1 Evaluation Measures A word aligner is usually evaluated in terms of Precision, Recall, and F-measure (or shortly F ), which are defined as follows (Fraser and Marcu, 2007): Precision = |A ?",
        "P | |A| , Recall = |A ?",
        "S| |S| F ?measure = 1 ?",
        "Precision + 1??",
        "Recall where A is the set of automatically computed alignments, and S and P refer to the sure (un- ambiguous) and possible (ambiguous) manual alignments; note that S ?",
        "P .",
        "In this paper, ?",
        "is set to 0.5 for all the experiments, in order to have a balance between Precision and Recall.",
        "In this paper we are mainly interested how the word-aligner performs on the unknown words; hence, we define a version of Precision, Recall, and F metrics focused on the oov-alignment only, i.e. the alignments for which either the source or the target word is not included in the training corpus.",
        "The subscript all identifies the standard met-rics; the subscript oov identifies their oov-based versions.",
        "In Figure 1 we show manual and automatic word alignments between an English-Italian sentence pair.",
        "A sure alignment, like are-sono, is represented by a solid line, and a possible alignment, like than-ai, by a dash line.",
        "An oov-alignment, like that linking the unknown English word deployable to the Italian word attivabili, is identified by a dotted line.",
        "According to this example, Precision and Recall will be about 0.85 (=11/13) and 0.91 (=10/11), respectively, and the corresponding F is hence about 0.88.",
        "Focusing on the oov-alignment only, Precision oov is 1.00 (=1/1), Recall oov is 0.50 (=1/2), and F oov is 0.67.",
        "3.2 Evaluation Benchmark In this paper, we compare word-alignment performance of three word-aligners introduced in Section 3.3 on three distinct tasks, namely English-Italian, English-French, and English-Spanish; the training corpora, common to all word-aligners, are subset of the JRC-legal corpus 1 (Steinberger et al., ), of the Europarl corpus V7.0 (Koehn, 2005), and of the Hansard parallel corpus 2 , respectively.",

        "For selecting the words to be replaced by artificially created strings, we do not differentiate between the known and unknown words; hence the actual oov-rate in the test corpus, used in the plots, might be slightly larger.",
        "To further make sure that the random selection of the words does not affect the systems, for each oov-noise we created 10 different test corpora and reported the averaged results.",
        "One might think of other approaches for introducing oov-noise, such as replacing singletons or low-frequency words which have more potential to be unknown, instead of randomly selection of the words.",
        "But in this paper we decided to follow the random selection of the words.",

        "We analyze their performance in aligning an held-out test corpora; in particular, we compare their capability in handling the unknown words.",
        "For a fair comparison, all aligners are trained on the same training corpora described in Section 3.2. berkeley aligner (Liang et al., 2006) applies the co-training approach for training the IBM model 1 and HMM.",
        "We trained berkeley aligner using 5 iterations of model 1 followed by 5 iterations of HMM.",
        "When applied to new sentence pairs, the system produces bi-directional symmetrized alignment.",
        "fast-align is a recently developed unsupervised word aligner that uses a log-linear re-parametrization of IBM model 2 for training the word alignment models (Dyer et al., 2013).",
        "We exploited the default configuration with 5 iterations for training.",
        "As the system is directional, we trained two systems (source-to-target and target-to-source).",
        "When applied to new sentence pairs, we first produced the two directional alignments, and then combined them into a symmetrized alignment by using the grow-diag-final-and heuristic (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "mgiza++ (Gao and Vogel, 2008) and its an-cestors, i.e. giza, and giza++, implement all the IBM models and HMM based alignment models.",
        "mgiza++ is a multithreaded version of giza++, which enables an efficient use of multi-core platforms.",
        "We trained the system using the following configuration for model iterations: 1 5 h 5 3 3 4 3 .",
        "mgiza++ also produces directional alignment; hence, we followed the same protocol to create a symmetrize alignment of sentence pairs as we did for fast-align.",
        "Differently from berkeley and fast-align, mgiza++ somehow adapts its models when applied to new sentence pairs.",
        "According to the so-called ?forced alignment?, it essentially proceeds with the training procedure on these new data starting from pre-trained and pre-loaded models, and produces the alignment as a by-product.",
        "In preliminary experiments, we observed that performing 3 iterations of model 4 is the best configuration for mgiza++ to align the new sentence pairs.",
        "These word aligners are designed to work in offline mode; they load the models and align the whole set of available input data in one shot.",
        "How-ever, in the online scenario where a single sentence pair is provided at a time, they need to reload the models every time which is very expensive in terms of I/O operations.",

        "The new set of symmetrized alignments can be used in different ways: (i) as a replacement of the initial word alignments as in (Espl?a-Gomis et al., 2012), or (ii) as additional alignment points to be added to the initial set.",
        "According to a preliminary investigation, we choose the latter option: only a subset of the new word alignments is used for updating the initial alignments.",
        "More specifi-cally, we add only the alignments of the new words which are not already aligned.",
        "Moreover, our approach differs from that proposed by Espl?a-Gomis et al. (2012) in the procedure to collect the original set of phrase pairs from the source and target sentence pair.",
        "They rely on the external sources of information such as online machine translation systems (e.g. Google Trans-late, and Microsoft Translator).",
        "Communicating with external MT systems imposes some delays to the pipeline, which is not desired for the online scenario.",
        "Furthermore, the words that are not known by the machine translation systems are not covered by any phrase-pair, hence the refinement module is not able to align them.",
        "We instead employ the phrase-extract software 5 provided by the Moses toolkit, which relies on the alignment information of the given sentence pair, and allows the inclusion of un-aligned unknown words in the extracted phrase pairs; hence, the refinement module has the potential to find the correct alignment for those words.",
        "Note that there is no constraint on the word alignment and phrase extraction modules used in the first step, hence, any word aligner and phrase extractor can be used for computing the initial alignments and extracting the parallel phrase pairs from the given sentence pairs.",
        "But, since the outputs of the first aligner make the ground for obtaining the alignments of the second level, they need to be highly accurate and precise.",

        "4.2 onlineMgiza++ The experiments to compare state-of-the-art word aligners, reported and discussed in Section 3, are carried out offline.",
        "This is because the aforementioned word aligners are not designed to work on-line, and need to load the models every time receives a new sentence pair.",
        "Loading the models is very time consuming, and depending on the size of the models might take several minutes, which is not desired for the online scenario.",
        "To overcome this problem, we decided to implement an online version of mgiza++ which provides the best performance as shown in Section 3.3.",
        "This new version, called onlineM-giza++, works in client-server mode.",
        "It consists of two main modules mgizaServer and mgiza-Client.",
        "mgizaServer is responsible for computing the alignment of the given sentence pairs.",
        "To avoid unnecessary I/O operations, mgizaServer loads all the required models once at the beginning of the alignment session, and releases them at the end.",
        "mgizaClient communicates with the client applications through the standard I/O channel.",
        "In our final experiments we observed some unexpected differences between the results of mgiza++ and onlineMgiza++.",
        "Therefore, we do not present the results of onlineMgiza++ in this paper.",
        "However, we expect the two systems produce the same results.",
        "5 Experimental Results In this section we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed refinement module.",
        "Each considered word aligner was equipped by our refinement module, and compared to its corresponding baseline.",
        "Figure 3 shows the oov-based F-measure achieved by the baseline and enhanced word aligners on all test sets and all tasks.",
        "We observe that the refinement module consistently improves the F-measure of all aligners on all language pairs; The improvement for mgiza++ are big (up to 10%) for very low oov-rates and decreases when the oov-rate increases; the same but smaller behavior is observed for fast-align.",
        "This is due to the fact that by inserting more oov words into the test sets the systems are able to produce less accurate alignment points, which leads in lower contextual information (i.e. smaller number of overlapping phrase-pairs) for aligning the unknown words.",

        "The quality of three state-of-the-art word aligners, namely berkeley, mgiza++, and fast-align, were evaluated on this task in terms of Precision, Recall, and F-measure.",
        "For this purpose we created a benchmark in which an increasing amount of the words of the test corpus are randomly replaced by new words in order to augment the oov-rate.",
        "The results show that the quality of the aligners on new words is quite low, and suggest that new models are required to effectively address this task.",
        "As a first step, we proposed a fast and language independent procedure for aligning the unknown words which refines any given automatic word alignment.",
        "The results show that the proposed approach significantly increases the word alignment quality of the new words.",
        "In future we plan to evaluate our approach in an end-to-end evaluation to measure its effect on the final translation.",
        "We also plan to investigate the exploitation of additional features such as linguistic and syntactic information in order to further improve the quality of the word alignment models as well as the proposed refinement procedure.",
        "However, this requires other policies of introducing new words, rather than just randomly selecting the words and replacing them by artificial strings.",
