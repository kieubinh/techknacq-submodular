        "We present an application of a phonological-prosodic algorithm which converts Brazilian Portuguese graphemes to phonological symbols.",
        "For a better understanding, a brief report about the origin of the algorithm, altogether with some theoretical comments are presented, before the case study of the phonological processes found in the speech samples of a child.",
        "Sessions were recorded, until the complete acquisition of all Portuguese phonemes by the child, which occurred in the fifth session.",
        "In 2008, we created the first version of a phonological-prosodic algorithm for Brazilian Portuguese.",
        "Actually, it is the functional algorithm of the grapheme to phoneme converter Nhenh?m (Vasil?vski, 2008, 2012a, 2012b).",
        "It has all written Portuguese spelling rules, and also the entire Portuguese prosodic system.",
        "When that algorithm was built, we kept in mind its usefulness to different fields deeply related to phonology, such as speech therapy, allowing the study of children phonological disorders, and language acquisition.",
        "We focus here on its application to language acquisition, allowing the study of children phonological acquisition processes.",
        "Hence, our objective is to show the phonological-prosodic algorithm usefulness to language survey, from a practical point of view, by showing the process involved in the last stages of the acquisition of Portuguese phonology.",
        "For a better understanding of the application and of the case study, the paper starts with some theory on phonological acquisition, then, some aspects of Brazilian Portuguese acquisition are presented.",
        "2 Phonological Development Studies of first language acquisition tend to support the view that the ability for language is innate in healthy human beings, and that its appearance can be predicted as part of the normal development of any child, given the right environment (Beaken, 1971).",
        "The greatest expansion of the phonological system is observed from 1 year and six months old up to 4 years old, when there is an increase of the phonetic inventory of most complex syllable structures and, therefore, a period characterized by the occurrence of omissions, substitutions, as well as other phonological processes (Wertzner, 2004).",
        "A phonological process is a mental operation that applies in speech to substitute, for a class of sounds or sound sequences presenting a specific common difficulty to the speech capacity of the individual, an alternative class identical but lacking the difficult property (Stampe, 1973).",
        "It is worth remembering that, at the richest stage of normal language development (1 year and a half to 4 years old, as said), inappropriate sound gestures are expected phonological processes that relate to children's adaptations, until they automate the adult speech patterns.",
        "Thus, the phonological processes ?",
        "that are natural and inborn ?",
        "guide the facilitation of complex vocal 3 gestures and their planning, until children reach the adult performance.",
        "Moreover, the early-acquired competence is filtered through an increasing number of phonological transformations to produce, finally, a mature performance.",
        "Although the mature phonemic system is acquired at an early stage, articulation may not be completely mature until after 7 years.",
        "Even though most children can be said to have mastered the complete set of potential phonemic oppositions of adult language by the age of 4 years ?",
        "in other words, their phonological competence is established ?",
        "yet, in adult terms, their performance falls short of their competence, in that they are unable to produce many of the gestures of mature articulation of the phonemes.",
        "Development after this stage takes place in the maturing of articulation, and in the acquisition of the complex transformations which operate on the basic acquired competence, to produce forms of speech similar to those heard from mature speakers (Beaken, 1971).",
        "2.1 Some Aspects of Brazilian Portuguese Phonological Acquisition Regarding phonemes, Brazilian Portuguese has 21 consonants (/p/, /b/, /f/, /v/, /m/, /n/, /t/, /d/, /s/, /z/, /l/, /?/, /r/, /?/, /?/, /?/, /?/, /k/, /g/, and the ar-chiphonemes |R|, |S|), and 14 vowels (/a/, /e/, /?/, /i/, /o/, /?/, /u/, /j/, /w/, /?/, /?/, /?/, /?/, /?/) (Scliar- Cabral, 2003a; C?mara Jr., 1986, 1977; Va-sil?vski, 2012a).",
        "Lateral liquid phonemes /l/ and /?/ and non-lateral liquid /r/ and /?/ are the latest to be acquired in Brazilian Portuguese.",
        "Furthermore, such acquisition is marked by intense use of diversified phonological processes.",
        "What perhaps justifies this late acquisition, in Brazilian Portuguese as well as in other systems, is that this class is very complex, both in articulation and phonological aspects (Lamprecht, 2004).",
        "Within this group of sounds, lateral phonemes are acquired before the non-lateral ones.",
        "The first lateral phoneme to be stabilized by children is /l/, which is subdued before the emergence of the first non-lateral liquid phoneme /?/.",
        "This occurs with the phonemes /?/ ?",
        "graphically lh ?",
        "and /r/, being the first acquired before the second (Her- nandorena and Lamprecht, 1997).",
        "In Portuguese, the phoneme /r/ occurs: 1) forming a syllable with an oral or nasal vowel (simple onset); 2) in second position of inseparable consonant clus-ters, preceding oral or nasal vowel (complex on-set); and 3) in syllable ending (coda, when it is the archiphoneme |R|).",
        "See Tab.1 for examples.",
        "In most cases, the acquisition of the phoneme /r/ happens initially in the position of simple onset (by 4 years old) and then in the position of complex onset (by 5 years old), the acquisition of the phoneme /r/ in coda position (that is, |R|) occurs by 4 years old (Lamprecht, 2004) either.",
        "Another linguistic phenomenon to be taken into account is diphthongization.",
        "It happens when one vowel breaks into two segments, where the first one matches the original vowel and the second (/j/ or /w/) is harmonic with the nature of the triggering vowel.",
        "In Brazilian Por-tuguese, one of the conditions when diphthongization occurs, and that matters here, is thus de-fined: a stressed vowel, followed by a devoiced alveolar fricative [s], in the ending syllable of a word, becomes diphthongized by the addition of a second segment, an [i] (Cagliari, 2002).",
        "Since diphthongization is a strengthening process, it occurs preferentially with strong vowels, and, in Romance languages, /a/ is the strongest vowel, and /i/, the weakest (Foley, 1977).",
        "The semivow-els of stressed syllables can be either produced or not in speech, both options belonging to Portuguese language system (Vasil?vski, 2012a).",
        "From the linguistic point of view, diphthongization is strongly related to the geographical dialectal variation (Leiria, 2000).",
        "3 A Program for Helping Language Acquisition Research By using Nhenh?m phonological-prosodic algo-rithm, we built Nhenh?m Fonoaud ?",
        "NhFonoaud ?, an application for assisting speech therapy, and so language acquisition.",
        "We began covering just one phonological process, called ?unvoiced- ness?",
        ": a substitution of a voiced sound for an unvoiced one (e.g. /b/ ?",
        "/p/) (Blasi and Va-sil?vski, 2011).",
        "Soon, we realized that the phonological-prosodic algorithm could cover much more.",
        "One of the motivations for creating such a system is that many Brazilian language acquisition researchers record their collected data using orthographic representation.",
        "As a result, those transcriptions are idiosyncratic and cannot be properly generalized, since they lack patterns.",
        "Data must be recorded in a phonologic-phonetic format, essential for these studies, since they address phonological processes.",
        "According to researchers and speech thera-pists, there is no similar work in Brazilian Portuguese.",
        "Probably, there are similar initiatives for 4 other languages, and we expect to make comparisons soon.",
        "3.1 The decoder Nhenh?m Phonological-prosodic Algorithm Nhenh?m (/??.???",
        "?/) is a computational program that decodes Brazilian's official writing system into phonological symbols and marks prosody (Vasil?vski, 2008, 2012a).",
        "In 2010, we augmented its main algorithm, so the system became able of providing the phonological syllabic division and the spelling syllabic division, with at least 99% of accuracy (see Vasil?vski, 2012a, 2012b for more details).",
        "Then we developed an automatic syllable parsing (Vasil?vski, 2010).",
        "In 2012, we made some adjustments regarding morphology, and solved the unpredictable situations brought, for example, by the prefix ?trans-?",
        "that can be either decoded as /tr?z/ or /tr?s/, in consequence of resyllabification (see Vasil?vski, 2012a).",
        "NhFonoaud benefits of all improvements obtained by the basic algorithm.",
        "3.2 Nhenh?m Fonoaud The application of Nhenh?m phonological-prosodic algorithm to language acquisition and speech therapy has been presented (Blasi and Vasil?vski, 2011, Vasil?vski, 2012a, 2012b), but this is the first time that a case study is discussed.",
        "The first major challenge of working with phonemic transcription is the consistency of data.",
        "Different research questions require different levels of representation (Albert et al., 2013).",
        "In this regard, relying on an orthographic representation of speech, when dealing with language acquisition, does not make sense.",
        "The program supports the analysis of processes that occur in the child's phonological sys-tem, through the automatic phonological transcription simultaneously to samples of the child speech recording.",
        "Thus, data relies on a phonemic representation of speech, automatically done by the algorithm, through Nhenh?m Fonoaud.",
        "NhFonoaud is designed for dealing with phonological tests, using words wittingly grouped to analyze specific aspects of speech and phenomena involved in its development.",
        "One of the tools of the program was the tests battery called Reception and Production of Spoken Language Assessment (Scliar-Cabral, 2003b).",
        "These tests were elaborated for assessing overt symptoms of spoken language reception and production problems.",
        "The first step is assessing phonetic features perception, namely, the ability of distinguishing minimal pairs, what means distinguishing Brazilian Portuguese words.",
        "The battery is composed by 81 pictures that represent specific words in Portuguese.",
        "The pictures are grouped into cards of six elements each.",
        "There are 15 cards, and some pictures appear in more than one.",
        "Each card is assembled to address the perception and production of one specific phonetic feature: 1) /v/-/f/, /p/-/b/, /t/-/d/; 2) /k/- /g/, /?/-/?/, /s/-/z/; 3) /m/-/n/, /t/-/d/, /s/-/f/; 4) /b/- /g/, /f/-/r/, /k/-/p/; 5) /t/-/k/, |R|-/s/, /l/-/?/; 6) /t/- /s/, /k/-|R|, /p/-/f/; 7) /d/-/t/, /t/-/r/, /d/-/s/; 8) /m/- /b/, /n/-/r/, /z/-/n/; 9) /?/-/?/, /d/-/n/, /n/-/l/; 10) /r/- /l/ (in three different contexts); 11) /?/-/?/, /i/-/u/, /e/-/o/; 12) /i/-/e/, /?/-/?/, /u/-/o/; 13) /e(j)/-/?/, /o/- /?/, /?/-/o(w)/; 14) /?/-/a/, /m/-/b/ (in two different contexts)/; 15) /?/-/e/, /o/-/?/, /a/-/?/.",
        "In the reception battery, the speech therapist, behind the child, says the word and the child must point to one of the six pictures in each card.",
        "In the production battery, the speech therapist points to one of the six pictures in each card and the child must label it.",
        "While the child labels the picture, the researcher can edit the canonical transcription provided by the program to match the child's production.",
        "For example, writing the lateral pho-neme, when the child produces it, instead of the vibrating one.",
        "In principle, four situations may happen during the assessment (Fig.1): the child does not recognize the picture (NR); the child gives the Figure 1.",
        "A register screen of Nhenh?m Fonoaud Picture: Beauty and the Beast.",
        "Disney?.",
        "5 expected response (Correspondeu); the child gives an unexpected response (deviation ?",
        "Des-vio); the child translates the word into his/her sociolinguistic variety (not deviation ?",
        "S?cio).",
        "NhFonoaud stores the records and compares them with the transcription expected, for generating reports.",
        "Hence, it is possible to build a cor-pus, to retrieve it, grouping it according to date, situation, child's age, type of card (test); then it is possible the conversion into numbers, using different formats, comparing the phonological transcription and the correspondent audio, and the recorded sessions.",
        "Therefore, it facilitates child's progress monitoring.",
        "In spite of working with words, NhFonoaud can be adjusted to work with bigger texts, formed by many sentences.",
        "For the purpose of assessing the child phonemic system, using minimal pairs and small sentences is enough.",
        "3.3 Testing Nhenh?m Fonoaud The data analysis that we now present refers to a child in a clear process of language acquisition.",
        "It is based on oral emissions of a girl that we will call In?s.",
        "The 15 cards (Scliar-Cabral, 2003b) were applied, covering all the Brazilian Portuguese phonemes.",
        "Five sessions were recorded, starting when In's was 2 years, 11 months, and 8 days; until she was 3 years, 8 months and 29 days.",
        "In's was born in Curitiba, Brazil, of Brazilian parents.",
        "She was not considered to have significant hearing loss.",
        "The child had developed some computer skills.",
        "Data was collected by her par-ents, by showing her the cards at the computer, during a daily conversation.",
        "In's had already contact with the pictures, and had learned some names that were not part of her daily life.",
        "The sessions were recorded by using the audio resources of the same computer, and the records were clear enough to be used in this study.",
        "3.3.1 Testing results The results reveal the phonological processes used by In?s.",
        "Four were observed in her emis-sions: two of substitution, one of deletion, and one of adding.",
        "From the reports generated by Nhenh?m Fonoaud, we created Tab 1.",
        "So, at the age of 2y11m8d, three phonological processes relate to a single phoneme of her mother tongue, the non-lateral, vibrating /r/, and another one to diphthongization.",
        "Thus, In's is only unable to produce the most complex Portuguese phoneme, in anyone of the three cases in which it occurs.",
        "The first session reveals that the child is able to produce all the vowels (14) of her mother tongue and 20 consonantal phonemes among the 21 of Brazilian Portuguese.",
