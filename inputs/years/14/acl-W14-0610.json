        "Big data makes it possible to observe in vivo the dynamics of a large number of different domains.",
        "It is particularly the case in the scientific field, where researchers produce a prolific literature but also other kinds of data like numbers, figures, images and so on.",
        "For a number of domains, large scientific archives are now available over several decades.",
        "This is for example the case for computational linguistics.",
        "The ACL Anthology contains more than 24,500 papers, for the most part in PDF format.",
        "The oldest ones date back to 1965 (first edition of the COLING conference) but it is mostly after 1980 that data are available in large volumes so that they can be exploited in evolution studies.",
        "The volume of data increases over time, which means there is a wide diversity in the number of papers available depending on the given period of time.",
        "There are similar archives for different domains like, e.g. physics (the APS database provided by the American Physical Society) or the bio-medical domain (with Medline).",
        "These scientific archives have already given birth to a large number of different pieces of work.",
        "Collaboration networks have for example been automatically extracted so as to study the topology of the domain (Girvan and Newman, 2002) or its morphogenesis (Guimera et al., 2005).",
        "Referencing has also been the subject of numerous studies on inter-citation (Garfield, 1972) and co-citation (Small, 1973).",
        "Other variables can be taken into account like the nationality of the au-thors, the projects they are involved in or the research institutions they belong to, but it is the analysis of the textual content (mostly titles, abstracts and keywords provided with the papers) that have attracted the most part of the research in the area since the seminal work of Callon (Callon et al., 1986; Callon et al., 1991).",
        "In this paper, our goal is to investigate the evolution of the field of computational linguistics, which means that text will play a crucial role.",
        "Textual analysis is then mixed with the study of individual trajectories in the semantic space: our goal is to propose possible avenues for the study of the dynamics of innovation in the computational lin-71 guistics domain.",
        "The ACL Anthology has been the subject of several studies in 2012, for the 50 years of the ACL.",
        "More specifically, a workshop called ?Re- discovering 50 Years of Discoveries?",
        "was organized to examine 50 years of research in NLP (but, for the reasons given above, the workshop mostly focused on the evolution of the domain since 1980).",
        "This workshop was also an opportunity to study a large scientific collection with recent NLP techniques and see how these techniques can be applied to study the dynamics of a scientific domain.",
        "The analysis of this kind of data is generally based on the extraction of key information (au- thors, keywords) and the discovery of their relationships.",
        "The data can be represented as a graph, therefore graph algorithmics can be used to study the topology and the evolution of the graph of collaborations or the graph of linked authors.",
        "It is thus possible to observe the evolution of the do-main, check some hypotheses or common assumptions about this evolution and provide a strong empirical basis to epistemology studies.",
        "The paper ?Towards a computational History of the ACL: 1980-2008?",
        "is very relevant from this point of view (Anderson et al., 2012).",
        "The authors try to determine the evolution of the main sub-domains of research within NLP since 1980 and they obtain very interesting results.",
        "For ex-ample, they show the influence of the American evaluation campaigns on the domain: when a US agency sponsored a sub-domain of NLP, one can observe a quick concentration effect since a wide number of research groups suddenly concentrated their efforts on the topic; when no evaluation campaign was organized, research was much more widespread across the different sub-domains of NLP.",
        "Even if this is partially predictable, it was not obvious to be able to show this in a collection of papers as large as the ACL Anthology.",
        "Our study has been profoundly influenced by the study by Anderson et al.",
        "However, our goal here is to characterize automatically the keywords based on the information they carry.",
        "We will thus combine keyword extraction with text zoning so as to categorize the keywords depending on their context of use.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "We first present an analysis of the structure of abstracts so as to better characterize their content by mixing keyword extraction with text zoning.",
        "We show how these techniques can be applied to the ACL Anthology in order to examine specific facts, more specifically concerning the evolution of the techniques used in the computational linguistics domain.",
        "2 A Text Zoning Analysis of the ACL Anthology The study of the evolution of topics in large corpora is usually done through keyword extraction.",
        "This is also our goal, but we would like to be able to better characterize these keywords and make a difference, for example, between keywords referring to concepts and keywords referring to methods.",
        "Hence, the context of these keywords seems highly important.",
        "Consequently, we propose to use Text Zoning that can provide an accurate characterization of the argumentative goal of each sentence in a scientific abstract.",
        "2.1 Previous work The first important contributions in text zoning are probably the experiments by S. Teufel who proposed to categorize sentences in scientific papers (and more specifically, in the NLP domain) according to different categories (Teufel, 1999) like BKG: General scientific background, AIM: Statements of the particular aim of the current paper or CTR: Contrastive or comparative statements about other work.",
        "This task is called Rhetorical zoning or Argumentative zoning since the goal is to identify the rhetoric or argumentative role of each sentence of the text.",
        "The initial work of Teufel was based on the manual annotation of 80 papers representing the different areas of NLP (the corpus was made of papers published within the ACL conferences or Computational Linguistics).",
        "A classifier was then trained on this manually annotated corpus.",
        "The author reported interesting results despite ?a 20% diference between [the] system and human perfor-mance?",
        "(Teufel and Moens, 2002).",
        "The learning method used a Naive Bayesian model since more sophisticated methods tested by the author did not obtain better results.",
        "Teufel in subsequent publications showed that the technique can be used to produce high quality summaries (Teufel and Moens, 2002) or precisely characterize the different citations in a paper (Ritchie et al., 2008).",
        "The seminal work of Teufel has since then given 72 rise to different kinds of works, on the one hand to refine the annotation method, and on the other hand to check its applicability to different scientific domains.",
        "Concerning the first point, research has focused on the identification of relevant features for classification, on the evaluation of different learning algorithms for the task and more importantly on the reduction of the volume of text to be annotated.",
        "Concerning the second point, it is mostly the biological and bio-medical domains that have attracted attention, since scientists in these domains often have to access the literature ?vertically?",
        "(i.e. experts may need to have access to all the methods and protocols that have been used in a specific domain) (Mizuta et al., 2006; Tbahriti et al., 2006).",
        "Guo has since developed a similar trend of research to extend the initial work of Teufel (Guo et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2013): she has tested a large list of features to analyze the zones, evaluated different learning algorithms for the task and proposed new methods to decrease the number of texts to be annotated.",
        "The features used for learning are of three categories: i) positional (location of the sentence inside the paper), ii) lexical (words, classes of words, bigrams, etc.",
        "are taken into con-sideration) and iii) syntactic (the different syntactic relations as well as the class of words appearing in subject or object positions are taken into ac-count).",
        "The analysis is thus based on more features than in Teufel's initial work and requires a parser.",
        "2.2 Application to the ACL Anthology corpus In our experiment, we only used the abstracts of the papers.",
        "Our hypothesis is that abstracts contain enough information and are redundant enough to study the evolution of the domain.",
        "Taking into consideration the full text would probably give too many details and thus introduce noise in the analysis.",
        "The annotation scheme includes five different categories, which are the following: OBJECTIVE (objectives of the paper), METHOD (meth- ods used in the paper), RESULTS (main results), CONCLUSION (conclusion of the paper), BACKGROUND (general context), as in (Reichart and Korhonen, 2012).",
        "These categories are also close to those of (Mizuta et al., 2006; Guo et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2013) and have been adapted to abstracts (as opposed to full text 1 ).",
        "It seems relevant to take into consideration an annotation scheme that has already been used by various authors so that the results are easy to compare to others.",
        "Around one hundred abstracts from the ACL Anthology have then been manually annotated using this scheme (?500 sentences; ACL abstracts are generally quite short since most of them are related to conference papers).",
        "The selection of the abstracts has been done using stratified sampling over time and journals, so as to obtain a representative corpus (papers must be related to different periods of time and different sub-areas of the do-main).",
        "The annotation has been done according to the annotation guideline defined by Y. Guo, especially for long sentences when more than one category could be applied (preferences are defined to solve complex cases 2 ).",
        "The algorithm defined by (Guo et al., 2011) is then adapted to our corpus.",
        "The analysis is based on positional, lexical and syntactic features, as explained above.",
        "No domain specific information was added, which makes the whole process easy to reproduce.",
        "As for parsing, we used the C&C parser (James Curran and Stephen Clark and Johan Bos, 2007).",
        "All the implementation details can be found in (Guo et al., 2011), especially concerning annotation and the learning algorithm.",
        "As a result, each sentence is associated with a tag corresponding to one of the zones defined in the annotation scheme.",
        "2.3 Results and Discussion In order to evaluate the text zoning task, a number of abstracts were chosen randomly (?300 sentences that do not overlap with the training set).",
        "CONCLUSION represented less than 3% of the sentences and was then dropped for the rest of the analysis.",
        "The four remaining zones are un-equaly represented: 18.05 % of the sentences refer to BACKGROUND, 14.35% to OBJECTIVE, 14.81 % to RESULT and 52.77 % to METHOD.",
        "Just by looking at these numbers, one can see how 1 The categories used in (Teufel, 1999) were not relevant since this model focused on full text papers, with a special emphasis on the novelty of the author's work and the attitude towards other people's work, which is not the case here.",
        "2 The task is to assign the sentence only a single category.",
        "The choice of the category should be made according to the following priority list: Conclusion > Objective > Result > Method> Background.",
        "The only exception is that when 75% or more of the sentence belongs to a less preferred category, then that category will be assigned to the sentence.",
        "73 Table 1: Result of the text zoning analysis (preci- sion) Category Precision Objective 83,87 % Background 81,25 % Method 71,05 % Results 82,05 % Figure 1: An abstract annotated with text zoning information.",
        "Categories are indicated in bold face.",
        "Most of errors in Korean morphological analysis and POS ( Part-of-Speech ) tagging are caused by unknown morphemes .",
        "BACKGROUND This paper presents a generalized unknown morpheme handling method with POSTAG(POStech TAGger ) which is a statistical/rule based hybrid POS tagging system .",
        "OBJECTIVE The generalized unknown morpheme guessing is based on a combination of a morpheme pattern dictionary which encodes general lexical patterns of Korean morphemes with a posteriori syllable tri-gram estimation .",
        "METHOD The syllable tri-grams help to calculate lexical probabilities of the unknown morphemes and are utilized to search the best tagging result .",
        "METHOD In our scheme , we can guess the POS's of unknown morphemes regardless of their numbers and positions in an eojeol , which was not possible before in Korean tagging systems .",
        "RESULTS In a series of experiments using three different domain corpora , we can achieve 97% tagging accuracy regardless of many unknown morphemes in test corpora .",
        "RESULTS methodological issues are important for the domain.",
        "We then calculate for each of the categories, the percentage of sentences that received the right la-bel, which allows us to calculate precision.",
        "The results are given in table 1.",
        "These results are similar to the state of the art (Guo et al., 2011), which is positive taking into consideration the small number of sentences annotated for training.",
        "The diversity of the features used makes it easy to transfer the technique from one domain to the other without any heavy annotation phase.",
        "Results are slightly worse for the METHOD category, probably because this category is more diverse and thus more difficult to recognize.",
        "The fact that NLP terms can refer either to objectives or to methods also contributes rendering the recognition of this category more difficult.",
        "Figure 1 shows an abstract annotated by the text zoning module (the paper is (Lee et al., 2002): it has been chosen randomly between those containing the different types of zones).",
        "One category is associated with each sentence but this is sometimes problematic: for example the fact that a hybrid method is used is mentioned in a sentence that is globally tagged as OBJECTIVE by the system.",
        "However, sentences tagged as METHOD contain relevant keywords like lexical pattern or tri-gram estimation, which makes it possible to infer that the approach is hybrid.",
        "One can also spot some problems with digitization, which are typical of this corpus: the ACL Anthology contains automatically converted files to PDF, which means texts are not perfect and may contain some digitization errors.",
        "3 Contribution to the Study of the Evolution ACL Anthology As said above, we are largely inspired by (Ander- son et al., 2012).",
        "We think the ACL Anthology is typical since it contains papers spanning over more than 30 years: it is thus interesting to use it as a way to study the main evolutions of the computational linguistics domain.",
        "The method can of course also be applied to other scientific corpora.",
        "3.1 Keyword extraction and characterization The first step consists in identifying the main keywords of the domain.",
        "We then want to more precisely categorize these keywords so as to identify the ones specifically referring to methods for example.",
        "From this perspective, keywords appearing in the METHOD sections are thus particularly interesting for us.",
        "However, one major problem is that there is no clear-cut difference between goals and methods in NLP since most systems are made of different layers and require various NLP techniques.",
        "For example, a semantic analyzer may use a part-of-speech tagger and a parser, which means NLP tools can appear as part of the method.",
        "Keyword extraction aims at automatically extracting relevant keywords from a collection of texts.",
        "A popular approach consists in first extracting typical sequences of tags that are then filtered according to specific criteria (these criteria can include the use of external resources but they are more generally based on scores mixing frequency and specificity (Bourigault and Jacquemin, 1999; Frantzi and Ananiadou, 2000)).",
        "In this study, we voluntarily used a minimal approach for keyword extraction and filtering since we want to keep most 74 Table 2: Most specific keywords found in the METHOD sections.",

        "We thus used NLTK for part-of-speech tagging and from this result extracted the most common noun phrases.",

        "possibly connected to other such patterns through propositions to form longer phrases (e.g. ?series of experiments?).",
        "Only the noun phrases appearing in more than 10 papers are kept for subsequent processing.",
        "Candidate keywords are then ranked per zone, according to their specificity (the zone they are the most specific of) .",
        "Specificity corresponds to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test that quantifies a distance between the empirical distribution functions of two samples.",
        "The test is calculated as follows: D = max x |S N 1 (x)?",
        "S N 2 (x)| (1) where S N 1 (x) et S N 2 (x) are the empirical distribution function of the two samples (that correspond in our case to the number of occurrences of the keyword in a given zone, and to the total number of occurrences of all the keywords in the same zone, respectively) (Press et al., 2007).",
        "A high value of D for a given keyword means that it is highly specific of the considered zone.",
        "At the opposite, a low value means that the keyword is spread over the different zones and not really specific of any zone.",
