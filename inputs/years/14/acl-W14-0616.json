        "In this paper we have investigated the syllabic structures found in Aromanian a Romance language spoken in the Balkans across multiple countries with important communities which spread from Greece to Romania.",
        "We have created a dictionary of syllabified words and analyzed a few general quantitative and phonological aspects of the dictionary.",
        "Furthermore, we have approached the syllabic complex-ities, the sonority patterns present in the syllable's constituents and the degree in which the Sonority Sequencing Principle (SSP) holds for this language.",
        "Based on all the information gathered we have devised an automatic syllabification algorithm which has a 99% accuracy on the words in the dictionary.",
        "In this way we hope to extend the existing phonological studies on Eastern Romance and to spread and preserve meta-linguistic information on this endangered language."

        "Aromanian, according to linguists (Papahagi, 1974) or (Saramandu, 1984) is part of a larger family of Eastern Romance languages consisting from Daco-Romanian (standard Romanian), Aro-manian, Megleno-Romanian and Istro-Romanian.",
        "We underline this characteristic because some of the linguistic properties that are present in Aromanian are also present, more or less, in the other three languages largely due to the common historical and linguistic context in which they formed and evolved.",
        "Unfortunately, Istro-Romanian and Megleno-Romanian are labeled by the UNESCO Red Book (2010) as ?severely endangered?",
        "languages with approximately 300 (Filipi, 2002) and respectively 5000 speakers (Atanasov, 2002).",
        "Aromanian is not in a better situation carrying the label of ?definitely endangered?",
        "with approximately 500,000 speakers (Atanasov, 2002).",
        "Cur-rently, the language has no accepted standard, being written in various forms depending on social and political factors of the regions in which it is spoken (Kahl, 2006).",
        "This is why we believe that a study on Aromanian can only be done empiri-cally, on corpus data or dictionaries or by adopting a multi-valued dialectal approach justified by field work.",
        "2 Previous work Although Capidan (1932) offers an exhaustive study on Aromanian with valuable comments on previous research, very few modern linguistic studies target this language and there are no computational linguistic studies as far as we are aware at this point.",
        "Caragiu-Mariot?ean (1968) offered one of the first modern studies with respect to the phonology and structural morphology of the lan-guage; her work represents our linguistic baseline.",
        "Since Aromanian is spoken in various re-gions, there are expected geographical particularities.",
        "Caragiu-Mariot?eanu (1997) classifies the Aromanian sub-dialects into two types: type F the variants that resemble the Farsherot, predominant in Albania and some parts of Greece and type A all the other variants.",
        "She argues that type F sub-dialects are spoken by smaller communities which have been influenced by type A.",
        "Type F sub-dialects have certain phonetic features: the closed-central vowel [1] does not exist, the groups of consonants [rl], [rn] are transformed into a sound that could be classified as a velar [r] (Capidan, 1932) and the diphthongs [e ?",
        "a] and [o ?",

        "Our dictionary uses the same alphabet to store the syllabified words.",
        "3 Dictionary of syllables The dictionary used in our study is compiled by Cunia (2010) from the dictionaries of Papahagi (1974) and the one of Dalametra (1906).",
        "The main advantage of this resource is its lexical rich-ness, including specific variants of words known by the author.",
        "Moreover, for most of the words, the syllabification is reproduced from a different dictionary compiled by Papahagi (1974).",
        "The later is considered a valuable and reliable linguistic resource for this language.",
        "The final size of the dictionary has approximately 69.000 syllabified words.",
        "Among the disadvantages, we could count a significant amount of misspelled words (that we have manually corrected), and words syllabified incorrectly.",
        "Also, the dictionary is written with the orthography proposed by Cunia (1997) using an alphabet that has only one diacritic.",
        "The purpose of the alphabet is to be more practical in the digital era, departing from other related phonemically spelled languages like Italian or Spanish.",
        "One of the main drawbacks of this alphabet is the compression of two different sounds (the mid-central vowel [@] and the closed-central vowel [1]) into the letter ?",
        "?a?, leaving the reader to decide which phoneme is actually used.",
        "The motivation behind the compression comes from the two vowels being geographical allophones for Aromanian (depend- ing on type F or type A sub-dialect).",
        "In this case we should be cautious when analyzing vowels as phonological units.",
        "This is not the only case where orthography can influence our study.",
        "Aromanian, together with Romanian (Chi- toran, 2001), contrasts diphthongs [e ?",
        "a], [o ?",
        "a] from semivowel (glide) to vowel sequences [ja] and [wa] (written here as [i ?",
        "a] and [u ?",
        "a]).",
        "This means that the phonological representation of diphthongs is the one proposed by Chitoran (2002): both elements of the diphthong are represented as sharing a syllable nucleus.",
        "According to this representa-tion, diphthongs are predicted to function as a single unit and a single segment.",
        "The orthography of our dictionary restricts us to partially operate with these distinctions.",
        "Similar to Romanian (Chitoran, 2001), the glide-vowel sequence [u ?",
        "a] is less frequent in our dictionary with less than 100 occurrences compared to the larger number of occurrences for the diphthong [o ?",
        "a].",
        "However, other dictionaries like the one of Caragiu-Mariot?eanu (1997), which is complete only to the letter ?D?, uses a different orthography and the actual contrasts might differ from resource to resource.",
        "Since this doesn't guarantee consistent results we represent internally all the above pairs as single units in the nucleus.",
        "In the current state, the exact phonetic value of the letter ??a?",
        "is ambiguous and the disambiguation is a non-trivial task unless parallel resources are available.",
        "To overcome the difficulty of using a specific alphabet, we have decided to convert the entire set of consonants from Latin script into IPA (Interna- tional Phonetic Alphabet).",
        "The consonant inventory of Aromanian is detailed in Table 1, the same alphabet is used internally to store the syllabified words.",
        "Our representation does not have the same amount of detail as a phonetic transcription would, instead, it offers a general unified format which could be used by linguists in future studies.",

        "While Aromanian has a slightly larger length of syllables, close to 4.5 but the length of the words does not exceed 7 syllables in average.",
        "Moreover, Romanian is a highly developed language containing a vast set of neologisms and loans that can affect the word length.",
        "While Aromanian is more an archaic language spoken in small communities usually used between family members lacking the lexical richness of a general-use language.",
        "On one hand, Aromanian has a smaller average length of words than its developed relative, on the other hand, at the phonological level, even though the decay is similar (overlapping most of the times), Aromanian presents a slightly larger length of syllables (in phonemes).",
        "This suggests that Aromanian is slightly more complex in terms of syllable phonotactics than Romanian.",
        "4.3 The structure of the syllable In order to investigate the complexity and diversity of the syllables in Aromanian, we have chosen to examine the constituents of the syllables in terms of sonority sequences.",
        "Phonetically, the spoken chain consists in waves of sonority or sound intensity (Lehmann, 2005).",

        "Liquids ?",
        "Glides?",
        "Vowels.",
        "On the other side, the scale can be represented by the articulatory resistance (Anderson and Ewen, 1987) of the phonemes as in Figure 3.",
        "Figure 3: Scale of articulatory resistance The Sonority Sequence Principle states that the syllable's peak is a group of segments of high 113 sonority while the syllable's boundaries consists of phonemes of low sonority.",
        "In almost every natural language there are exceptions to this principle and investigating it can be valuable in speech recognition and in automatic syllabification based on phonotactic rules (Frampton, 2011).",
        "If the exceptions are accounted then the number of sonority peaks in a word is correlated with the number of syllables.",
        "In the same manner, the number of syllable boundaries is correlated with the number of low sonority phonemes.",
        "As previously mentioned, the ?cv?",
        "structure is universal in every language, thus the syllable may have two basic constituents (Fudge 1969, 1987): an onset (governed by the consonant) and a rhyme (governed by the vowel).",
        "The rhyme is further divided into a nucleus (forming the syllable's sonority peak) and a coda (consonants of descending sonority), the following schema exemplifying the word ?tram?",
        "is relevant to the definition: ?",

        "This creates a peak of sonority inside the structure of the coda, thus a sonority reversal right at the end of the syllable.",

        "is a particular feature of Aromanian.",
        "Table 3 contains the percentages regarding the sonority of the codas.",
        "Because of the final glides, a large number of codas (41%) will break the SSP by having a sonority reversal (a sequence of phonemes in ascending sonority inside the coda).",

        "The key is whether we want to cut the syllable before or after the minimum point and this fact is determined by phonotactic constraints.",
        "The initial semisyllables, although they respect the SSP, are merged within the next syllable and the word final codas may end in glides.",
        "We have compared the output of this algorithm with the actual data already in our dictionary.",
        "Almost one percent of the words were incorrectly syllabified because they were exceptions to the above rules and the overall precision was 99%.",
        "This algorithm can easily be extended to other Eastern Romance languages by verifying the seven rules provided.",

        "It is not an easy task to execute a study on a language that lacks an institutionalized standard.",
        "Our approach is empirical, corpus based and the quality of the results is strictly dependent on the quality of the corpus.",
        "This is why we have focused on investigating general phonological properties of the language in the limits afforded by the corpus at our disposal.",
        "Comparisons with existing studies on Romanian reaffirm the tight relation between the two languages and offer confidence that the results obtained are in accordance with existing facts about them.",
        "Moreover, based on phonotactic investigations, we have constructed an algorithm for automatic syllabification in Aromanian that has a 99% accuracy.",
        "Future studies involve developing this resource to disambiguate the letter ??a?",
        "and adding more detail in the phonetic representation by recording native speakers.",
        "The current phonological study will help us to further develop rule-based resources on morphology considering existing theoretical studies (Caragiu-Mariot?eanu, 1968) and may help us to better understand the evolution of the Eastern Romance languages and the relations between them.",
        "Last but not least, we hope that developing these linguistic and computational resources will encourage a widespread use of Aromanian.",
