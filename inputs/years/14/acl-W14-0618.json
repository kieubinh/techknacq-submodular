        "Wayang shows rely heavily on the knowledge and creativity of the puppeteer (dalang).",
        "Often, the story and knowledge about the shadow puppets is known only to the puppeteer and not set forth in writing.",
        "Such a lack of knowledge transfer process results in a lot of knowledge that is known only by the puppeteer cannot be shared to others, which leads to the loss of cultural richness.",
        "The knowledge held by the puppeteer ought to be propagated to future generations in order to be learned and developed.",
        "Information about the shadow puppets can be represented as textual data describing hundreds of characters.",
        "Constructing an ontology manually from such a large data source is time consuming and labor intensive.",
        "Work on relation extraction has already been conducted in the past.",
        "Initially, supervised learning approaches were used, for example feature-based supervised learning (Kambhatla, 2004; Zhao and Grishman, 2005).",
        "Some features that are generally used are words that lie among the entities, the entity type, the number of words between two entities, and the number of entities between two entities.",
        "In addition, there are several studies that use kernel-based approach.",
        "The kernel K(x, y) defines the similarity between objects x and y in the high-dimensional objects.",
        "There are various elements used to construct kernels such as word subsequence (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005) and parse trees (Zelenko et al., 2003; Culotta et al., 2004).",
        "In addition, several studies use semi-supervised learning.",
        "DIPRE (Brin, 1998) tries to find the relationship between the author interest and the book he/she had written.",

        "Unfortunately these are not readily available for Indonesian, the language our wayang data is in.",

        "In this study, we explore methods to automatically construct an ontology using a corpus of wayang character descriptions using relation extraction and clustering.",
        "This method requires a gazetteer which contains a list of entities from the text.",
        "The entity types that are contained in the gazetteer are the name of the puppet characters, their kingdoms of origin, and their various artefacts such as weapons or spells.",
        "We realize our method does not yet fully constitute the development of a complete ontology, but provides an important step towards that direction, namely the identification of relations to be found within the ontology.",

        "The information or knowledge that is contained within the text is extracted by employing relation extraction.",

        "2.1 Automatic Ontology Construction During this stage, the system attempts to find all possible relationships that occur between any two entities.",

        "Every word contained in the gazetteer will be tagged in accordance to its entity type.",
        "The number of entities in the gazetteer is still general.",
        "Thus, the entities are subdivided into more specific groups.",
        "The entity group is based on Pitoyo Amrih (Amrih, 2011) which consists of 29 groups.",
        "In this study we used two tagging methods, i.e. by using a wayang entity that has not been detailed and by using detailed entities (based on the type of wayang entity).",
        "Different tagging treatment was conducted to examine whether this affects the ontology result or not.",
        "The example of tagged text using wayang entity that has not been detailed and detailed entities can be seen in Figures 3 and 4.",
        "Subsequently, pronoun resolution is employed to resolve the entity reference of a pronoun.",
        "The system will then perform relation extraction by analyzing the words occurring between tagged entities.",
        "This process will generate candidate relationship patterns between entities (X, r, Y), where X and Y are entities and r is the textual pattern that defines the relationship between the two entities.",
        "The patterns that are obtained from the previous process are passed on to the next step that is the process of eliminating irrelevant information, so that only valid are used in the next process.",

        "This corpus consists of 363 wayang characters; where there are 187 puppet characters that have annotations and 176 puppet characters that do not have annotations.",
        "The Wikipedia corpus has substances of wayang character annotation from the Mahabaratha and the Ramayana book and it also contains the description of particular characters in Indonesian culture.",
        "The Wikipedia corpus consists of 180 puppet characters, which all have their respective annotations.",
        "The last corpus is a combination of ki-demang and Wikipedia corpus.",
        "Merging data from both corpora is expected to enrich the annotation of wayang characters.",
        "Combining these data led to two perspectives in wayang character annotation, which is based on Mahabaratha/Ramayana book and based on the Javanese culture community.",

        "For the first experiment we want to evaluate the corpus variation.",
        "The objective of this experiment is to find the most representative corpus used in ontology construction.",
        "Based on the experiment, when the system is employing entity type pairs in feature extraction, ki-demang corpus has a high CP (76.54%) rate and a lower IK (11.49%) and RC (44.8%) rate.",
        "When the CP rate is high, it means that the pattern variation in particular cluster is modest and tends to be a singleton (only one pattern in a cluster).",
        "It is the impact of the information homogeneity of ki-demang corpus compared to the other corpora.",
        "The IK and RC rate of Wikipedia corpus and consolidated corpus is better than ki-demang corpus.",
        "The Wikipedia corpus has better information content compared to the ki-demang corpus, thus the consolidated corpus has a better RC and IK rate compared to individual corpora.",

        "It means that the consolidated corpus has richer information than ki-demang or Wikipedia corpus.",
        "The second experiment was conducted to evaluate the threshold value in clustering process.",
        "The objective of this experiment is to find the best threshold value for relation clustering.",
