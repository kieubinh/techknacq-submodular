        "Ubiquitously present in human thinking, causality is encoded in language in various ways.",
        "Computational approaches to causality are mostly concerned with automatic extraction of causal schemata (Michotte, 1963; Tversky and Kahne-man, 1982; Gilovich et al., 1985) from spontaneously produced texts based on linguistic encoding.",
        "A key to success in this endeavour is understanding how human language encodes causality.",
        "Linguistic expressions of causality, such as causative conjunctions, verbs, morphemes, and constructions, are highly ambiguous, encoding not only the real-world causality, but also the structure of discourse, as well as speakers?",
        "attitudes (Moeschler, 2011; Zufferey, 2012).",
        "Causality judgements are hard to elicit in an annotation project.",
        "This results in a low inter-annotator agreement and makes the evaluation of automatic systems difficult (Bethard, 2007; Grivaz, 2012).",
        "Our study addresses the relationship between world-knowledge about causality and the grammar of language, focusing on the causal structure of events expressed by verbs.",
        "In current analyses, the meaning of verbs is decomposed into multiple predicates which can be in a temporal and causal relation (Pustejovsky, 1995; Talmy, 2000; Levin and Rappaport Hovav, 2005; Ramchand, 2008).",
        "(1) a. Causative: Adam broke the laptop.",
        "b. Anticausative: The laptop broke.",
        "We propose a computational approach to the causative alternation, illustrated in (1), in which an event (breaking the laptop in (1)) can be dissociated from its immediate causer (Adam in (1a)).",
        "The causative alternation has been attested in almost all languages (Schafer, 2009), but it is realised with considerable cross-linguistic variation in the sets of alternating verbs and in the grammatical encoding (Alexiadou et al., 2006; Alexiadou, 2010).",
        "Since the causative alternation involves most verbs, identifying the properties of verbs which allow them to alternate is important for developing representations of the meaning of verbs in general.",
        "Analysing the structural components of the meaning of verbs proves important for tasks such as word sense disambiguation (Lapata and Brew, 2004), semantic role labelling (M`arquez et al., 2008), cross-linguistic transfer of semantic annotation (Pad√≥ and Lapata, 2009; Fung et al., 2007; van der Plas et al., 2011).",
        "The knowledge about the likelihood of external causation might be helpful in the task of detecting implicit arguments of verbs and, especially deverbal nouns (Gerber and Chai, 2012; Roth and Frank, 2012).",
        "Knowing, for example, that a verb expresses an externally caused event increases the probability of an implicit causer if an explicit causer is not detected in a particular instance of the verb.",
        "Our study should 40 contribute to the development of formal and extensive representations of grammatically relevant semantic properties of verbs, such as Verb Net (Kip- per Schuler, 2005) and PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005).",
        "2 External Causation and the Grammar of Language The distinction between external and internal causation in events described by verbs is introduced by Levin and Rappaport Hovav (1994) to account for the fact that the alternation is blocked in some verbs such as bloom in (2).",
        "In Levin and Rappaport Hovav's account, verbs which describe externally caused events alternate (1), while verbs which describe internally caused events do not (2).",
        "(2) a.",
        "The flowers suddenly bloomed.",
        "b. * The summer bloomed the flowers.",
        "The main objection to this proposed generalisation is that it does not account for the cross-linguistic variation.",
        "Since the distinction concerns the meaning of verbs, one could expect that the verbs which are translations of each other alternate in all languages.",
        "This is, however, often not true.",
        "There are many verbs that do alternate in some languages, while their counterparts in other languages do not (Alexiadou et al., 2006; Schafer, 2009; Alexiadou, 2010).",
        "For example, appear and arrive do not alternate in English, but their equivalents in Japanese or in the Salish languages do.",
        "To account for the variation in cross-linguistic data Alexiadou (2010) introduces the notion of cause-unspecified events, a category between externally caused and internally caused events.",
        "Introducing gradience into the classification allows Alexiadou to propose generalisations which apply across languages: cause-unspecified verbs alternate in all languages, while only some languages allow the alternation if the event is either externally or internally caused.",
        "To allow the alternation in the latter cases, languages need a special grammatical mechanism.",
        "In English, for example, this mechanism is not available, which is why only cause-unspecified verbs alternate.",
        "The alternation is thus blocked in both verbs describing externally caused and internally caused events.",
        "Alexiadou's account is based not only on the observations about the availability of the alterna-tion, but also about morphological encoding of the alternation across languages.",
        "Unlike English, which does not mark the alternation morphologically (note that the two versions of English verbs in (1-3) are morphologically identical), other languages encode the alternation in different ways, as shown in (3).",
        "(3) Causative Anticausative Mongolian xajl-uul-ax xajl-ax ?melt?",
        "?melt?",
        "Russian rasplavit rasplavit-sja ?melt?",
        "?melt?",
        "Japanese atum-eru atum-aru ?gather?",
        "?gather?",
        "An analysis of the distribution of morphological marking across languages leads Haspelmath (1993) to introduce the notion of likelihood into his account of the meaning of the alternating verbs.",
        "In a study of 31 verbs in 21 languages from all over the world, Haspelmath notices that certain verbs tend to get the same kind of marking across languages.",
        "For each verb, he calculates the ratio between the number of languages which mark the anticausative version and the number of languages which mark the causative version of the verb.",
        "He interprets this ratio as a quantitative measure of how spontaneous events described by the verbs are.",
        "As each verb is assigned a different score, ranking the verbs according to the score results in a ?scale of increasing likelihood of spontaneous occurrence?.",
        "Events with a low anti-causative/causative ratio (e.g. boil, dry, melt) are likely to occur spontaneously, while events with a high ratio (e.g. break, close, split) are likely to be caused by an external causer.",
        "3 The Model Our study pursues the quantitative assessment of the likelihood of external causation in the events described the alternating verbs.",
        "We estimate the likelihood by means of a Bayesian model which divides events into classes based on the distribution of causative and anticausative uses of verbs in a corpus.",
        "By varying the settings of the model, we address two questions discussed in the linguistic literature: 1) Is the distinction between externally caused and internally caused events binary,, as argued by Levin and Rappaport Hovav (1994), or are there are intermediate classes, as argued by Alexiadou (2010)?",
        "and 2) Do we obtain better estimation of the likelihood from cross-linguistic than from monolingual data?",
        "41 We design a probabilistic model which estimates the likelihood of external causation and generates a probability distribution over a given number of event classes for each verb in a given set of verbs.",
        "The model formalises the intuition that an externally caused event tends to be expressed by a verb in its causative realisation.",
        "In other words, if the likelihood of external causation of the event is encoded in the use of the verb which describes the event, then the causer is expected to appear frequently in the realisations of the verb.",
        "The opposite is expected for internally caused events.",
        "Cause-unspecified events are expected to appear with and without the causer equally.",
        "To take into account the two questions discussed in the theoretical approaches, namely the number of classes and the role of cross-linguistic data in the classification of events, we design four versions of the model, varying the input data and the number of classes in the output: a) monolingual input and two classes; b) cross-linguistic input and two classes; c) monolingual input and three classes; d) cross-linguistic input and three classes.",
        "The current cross-linguistic versions of the model include only two languages, English and German, because we test the models in a minimal cross-linguistic setting.",
        "In principle, the approach can be easily extended to include any number of languages.",
        "As it can be seen in its graphical representation in Figure 1, the model consists of three variables in the monolingual version and of four variables in the cross-linguistic version.",
        "V Caus En V Caus En Ge Figure 1: Two version of the Bayesian net model for estimating external causation.",
        "The first variable in both versions is the set of verbs V .",
        "This can be any given set of verbs.",
        "The second variable is the event class of the verb, for which we use the symbol Caus.",
        "The values of this variable depend on the assumed classification.",
        "In the two-class version, the values are causative, representing externally caused events, and anticausative, representing internally caused events.",
        "In the three-class version, the variable can take one more value, unspecified, representing cause-unspecified events.",
        "The third (En) and the fourth (Ge) (in the cross-linguistic version) variables are the surface realisations of the verbs in parallel instances.",
        "These variables take three values: causative for active transitive use, anticausative for intransitive use, and passive for passive use in the languages in question.",
        "We represent the relations between the variables as a Bayesian network.",
        "The variable that represents the event class of verbs (Caus) is unobserved.",
        "The values for the other three variables are observed in the data source.",
        "Note that the input to the model does not contain the information about the event class at any point.",
        "The dependence between En and Ge in the bilingual version of the model represents the fact that the two instances of a verb are translations of each other, but does not represent the direction of translation in the actual data.",
        "The form of the instance in one language depends on the form of the parallel instance because they express the same meaning in the same context, regardless of the direction of translation.",
        "Assuming that the variables are related as in Figure 1, En and Ge are conditionally independent of V given Caus, so we can calculate the probability of the model as in (4) for the monolingual version and as in (6) for the cross-linguistic version.",
        "(4) P (v, caus, en) = P (v) ?",
        "P (caus|v) ?",
        "P (en|caus) (5) P (caus|v, en) = P (v)?P (caus|v)?P (en|caus)?",
        "caus P (v)?P (caus|v)?P (en|caus) We estimate the conditional probability of the event class given the verb (P (caus|v)) by querying the model, as shown in (5) for the monolingual version and in (7) for the bilingual version.. 42 (6) P (v, caus, en, ge) = P (v) ?",
        "P (caus|v) ?",
        "P (en|caus) ?",
        "P (ge|caus, en) (7) P (caus|v, en, ge) = P (v)?P (caus|v)?P (en|caus)?P (ge|caus,en)?",
        "caus P (v)?P (caus|v)?P (en|caus)?P (ge|caus,en) We assign to each verb the event class that is most probable given the verb, as in (8).",
        "(8) caus class(verb) = argmax caus P (caus|v) All the variables in the model are defined so that the parameters can be estimated on the basis of frequencies of instances of verbs automatically extracted from parsed corpora.",
        "4 Experiments The accuracy of the predictions of the model is evaluated in experiments.",
        "4.1 Materials and Methods The verbs for which we estimate the likelihood are the 354 verbs that participate in the causative alternation in English, as listed by Levin (1993), and the 26 verbs listed as alternating in a typological study (Haspelmath, 1993).",
        "We estimate the parameters of the model by implementing the expectation-maximisation algorithm.",
        "The algorithm is initialised by assigning different arbitrary values to the parameters of the model.",
        "The classification reported in the paper is obtained after 100 iterations.",
        "We train the classifier using the data automatically extracted from an English-German parallel corpus (Europarl (Koehn, 2005)).",
        "Both monolingual and bilingual input data are extracted from the parallel corpus.",
        "All German verbs which are word-aligned with the alternating English verbs listed in the literature are regarded as German equivalents.",
        "By extracting cross-linguistic equivalents automatically from a parallel corpus, we avoid manual translation into German of the lists of English verbs discussed in the literature.",
        "In this way, we eliminate the judgements which would be involved in the process of translation.",
        "The corpus is syntactically parsed (using the MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2007)) and word-aligned (using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003)).",
        "For both the syntactic parses and word alignments, we reuse the data provided by Bouma et al. (2010).",
        "We extract only the instances of verbs where both the object (if there is one) and the subject are realised in the same clause, excluding the instances involving syntactic movements and coreference.",
        "Transitive instances are considered causative realisations, intransitive anticausative.",
        "We count passive instances separately because they are formally transitive, but they usually do not express the causer.",
        "German equivalents of English alternating verbs are extracted in two steps.",
        "First, all verbs occurring as transitive, intransitive, and passive were extracted from the German sentences that are sentence-aligned with the English sentences containing the instances of alternating verbs.",
        "These instances were considered candidate translations.",
        "The instances that are the translations of the English instances were then selected on the basis of word alignments.",
        "Instances where at least one element (the verb, the head of its object, or the head of its subject) is aligned with at least one element in the English instance were considered aligned.",
        "Only the instances of English verbs that are translated with a corresponding finite verbal form in German are extracted, excluding the cases where English verbs are translated into a corresponding non-finite form such as infinitive, nomi-nalization, or participle in German.",
        "4.2 Evaluation We evaluate the performance of the models against the scale of spontaneous occurrence proposed by Haspelmath (1993), shown in (9).",
        "We expect the verbs classified as internally caused by our models to correspond to the verbs with a low morphological anticausative/causative ratio (those on the left side of the scale).",
        "The opposite is expected for externally caused verbs.",
        "Cause-unspecified verbs are expected to be in the middle of Haspelmath's scale.",
        "(9) boil, dry, wake up, sink, learn-teach, melt, stop, turn, dissolve, burn, fill, finish, begin, spread, roll, develop, rise-raise, improve, rock, connect, change, gather, open, break, close, split To evaluate the output of our models against the scale, we discretise the scale so that the agreement 43 is maximised for each version of the model.",
        "For example, the threshold which divides the verbs into anticausative and causative in the two-way classification is set after the verb turn.",
        "By evaluating the performance of our models against a typology-based measure, we avoid eliciting human judgements, which is a known problem in computational approaches to causality.",
        "The downside of this approach is that such evaluation is currently possible for a relatively small number of verbs.",
        "5 Results and Discussion Table 1 shows all the confusion matrices of the classifications performed automatically in comparison with the classifications based on the typology rankings.",
        "1 In the two-way classification, the two versions of the model, with monolingual and with bilingual input, result in identical classifications.",
        "The agreement of the models with the typological ranking can be considered very good (85%).",
        "The optimal threshold divides the verbs into two asymmetric classes: eight verbs in the internally caused class and eighteen in the externally caused class.",
        "The agreement is better for the internally caused class.",
        "In the three way-classification, the performance of both versions of the model drops.",
        "In this set-ting, the output of the two versions differs: there are two verbs which are classified as externally caused by the monolingual version and as cause-unspecified by the bilingual version, which results in a slightly better performance of the bilingual version.",
        "Given the small number of evaluated verbs, however, this tendency cannot be considered significant.",
        "The three-way classification is more difficult than the two-way classification, but the difficulty is not only due to the number of classes, but also to the fact that two of the classes are not well-distinguished in the data.",
        "While the class of internally caused events is relatively easily distinguished (small number of errors in all classifica-tions), the classes of externally caused and cause-unspecified verbs are hard to distinguish.",
        "This finding supports the two-way classification argued for in the literature.",
        "The classification performed by the bilingual 1 The table contains 26 instead of 31 verbs because corpus data could not be reliably extracted for some phrasal verbs listed by Haspelmath.",
        "model indicates that the distinction between externally caused and cause-unspecified verbs might still exist.",
        "Compared to the monolingual clas-sification, more verbs are classified as cause-unspecified, and they are grouped in the middle of the typological scale.",
        "Since the model takes into account cross-linguistic variation in the realisations of the alternating verbs, the observed difference in the performance could be interpreted as a sign that the distinction between cause-unspecified and externally caused events does emerge in cross-linguistic contexts.",
        "While supporting the two-way classification of events, our experiments do not provide a definite answer to the question of whether there are more than two classes of events.",
        "To obtain significant results, more verbs need to be evaluated.",
        "However, the typological data used in our experiments (Haspelmath, 1993) are not easily available.",
        "This kind of data are currently not included in the typological resources (such as the WALS database (Dryer and Haspelmath, 2013)), but they can, in principle, be collected from other electronic sources of language documentation, which are increasingly available for many different languages.",
        "6 Related Work The proposed distinction between externally and internally caused events is addressed by McKoon and Macfarland (2000).",
        "They study twenty-one verbs defined in the linguistic literature as describing internally caused events and fourteen verbs describing externally caused events.",
        "Their corpus study shows that the appearance of these verbs as causative (transitive) and anticausative (intransi- tive) cannot be used as a diagnostic for the kind of meaning that has been attributed to them.",
        "Since internally caused verbs do not enter the alternation, they were expected to be found in intransitive clauses only.",
        "This, however, was not the case.",
        "The probability for some of these verbs to occur in a transitive clause is actually quite high (0.63 for the verb corrode, for example).",
        "More importantly, no difference was found in the probability of the verbs denoting internally caused and externally caused events to occur as transitive or as intransitive.",
        "This means that the acceptability judgements used in the qualitative analysis do not apply to all the verbs in question, and, also, not to all the instances of these verbs.",
