        "Since, the task of automatic recognition of causality is quite challenging, researchers have addressed this problem by considering specific constructions.",
        "For example, various models have been proposed to identify causation between verbs (Bethard and Martin, 2008; Beamer and Girju, 2009; Riaz and Girju, 2010; Do et al., 2011; Riaz and Girju, 2013) and between nouns (Girju and Moldovan, 2002; Girju, 2003).",
        "Do et al. (2011) have worked with verb-noun pairs for causality detection but they focused only on a small list of predefined nouns representing events.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the task of identifying causality encoded by verb-noun pairs (ex- ample 3).",
        "We propose a novel model which first predicts cause or non-cause relations using a supervised classifier and then incorporates additional types of knowledge to reduce errors in predictions.",
        "Using a supervised classifier, our model identifies causation by employing shallow linguistic features (e.g., lemmas of verb and noun, words between verb and noun).",
        "Such features have been used successfully for various NLP tasks (e.g., part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, etc.)",
        "but confinement to such features does not help much to achieve performance for identifying causation (Riaz and Girju, 2013).",
        "Therefore, in our model we plug in additional types of knowledge to obtain better predictions for the current task.",

        "?",
        "Verbs are the important components of language for expressing events of various types.",
        "For example, Pustejovsky et al. (2003) have classified events into eight semantic classes: OCCURRENCE, PERCEPTION, RE-PORTING, ASPECTUAL, STATE, I STATE, I ACTION and MODAL.",
        "We argue that there are some semantic classes in this list with high tendency to encode cause or non-cause relations.",
        "For example, reporting events represented by verbs say, tell, etc., have high tendency to just report other events instead of encoding causality with them.",

        "Each causal relation is characterized by two roles i.e., cause and its effect.",
        "In example 3 above, the noun ?hurricane?",

        "2 Related Work In computational linguistics, researchers have always shown interest in the task of automatic recognition of causal relations because success on this task is critical for various natural language applications (Girju, 2003; Chklovski and Pantel, 2004; Radinsky and Horvitz, 2013).",
        "Following the successful employment of linguistic features for various tasks (e.g., part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, etc.",
        "), initially NLP researchers proposed approaches relying mainly on such features to identify causality (Girju, 2003; Bethard and Martin, 2008; Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008; Pitler and Nenkova, 2009; Pitler et al., 2009).",
        "However, researchers have recently shifted their attention from these features and tried to consider other sources of knowledge for extracting causal relations (Beamer and Girju, 2009; Riaz and Girju, 2010; Do et al., 2011; Riaz and Girju, 2013).",
        "For example, Riaz and Girju (2010) and Do et al. (2011) have proposed unsupervised metrics for learning causal dependencies between two events.",
        "Do et al. (2011) have also incorporated minimal supervision with unsupervised metrics.",
        "For a pair of events (a, b), their model makes the decision of cause or non-cause relation based on unsupervised co-occurrence counts and then improves this decision by using minimal supervision from the causal and non-causal discourse markers (e.g., because, although, etc.).",
        "In search of novel and effective types of knowledge to identify causation between two verbal events, Riaz and Girju (2013) have proposed a model to learn a Knowledge Base (KB c ) of verb-verb pairs.",
        "In this knowledge base, the English language verb-verb pairs are automatically classified into three categories: (1) Strongly Causal, (2) Ambiguous and (2) Strongly Non-Causal.",
        "The Strongly Causal and Strongly Non-Causal categories contain verb-verb pairs with highest and least tendency to encode causality, respectively and rest of the verb-verb pairs are considered ambiguous with tendency to encode both types of relations.",
        "They claim that this knowledge base of verb-verb pairs is a rich source of causal associations.",
        "The incorporation of this resource into a causality detection model can help identifying causality with better performance.",
        "In this research, we also try to go beyond the scope of shallow linguistic features and identify additional 49 interesting types of knowledge for the current task.",
        "3 Computational Model for Identifying Causality In this section, we introduce our model for identifying causality encoded by verb-noun pairs.",
        "Specifically, we extract all main verbs and noun phrases from a sentence and predict cause or non-cause relation on verb-noun phrase (v-np) pairs.",
        "In order to make task easier, we consider only those v-np pairs where v (verb) is grammatically connected to np (noun phrase).",
        "We assume that a v and np are grammatically connected if there exists a dependency relation between them in the dependency tree.",
        "We apply a dependency parser (Marn- effe et al., 2006) to identify such dependencies.",
        "Our model first employs a supervised classifier relying on linguistic features to make binary predictions (i.e., does a verb-noun phrase pair encode a cause or non-cause relation?).",
        "We then incorporate additional types of knowledge on top of these binary predictions to improve performance.",
        "3.1 Supervised Classifier In this section, we propose a basic supervised classifier to identify causation encoded by v-np pairs.",
        "To set up this supervised classifier, we need a training corpus of instances of v-np pairs encoding cause and non-cause relations.",
        "For this purpose, we employ the annotations of FrameNet project (Baker et al., 1998) provided for verbs.",
        "For example, consider the following annotation from FrameNet for the verb ?dying?",
        "with argument ?solvent abuse?",
        "where the pair ?dying- solvent abuse?",
        "encodes causality.",
        "A campaign has started to try to cut the rising number of children dying [ cause from solvent abuse].",
        "To generate a training corpus, we collect annotations of verbs from FrameNet s.t.",
        "the annotated element (aka.",
        "frame element) is a noun phrase.",
        "For example, we get a causal training instance of ?dying-solvent abuse?",
        "pair from the above annotation.",
        "We assume that if a FrameNet's annotated element contains a verb in it then this may not represent a training instance of v-np pair.",
        "For exam-ple, we do not consider the following annotation in our training corpus where causality is encoded between two verbs i.e., ?died-fell?.",
        "A fitness fanatic died [ cause when 26 stone of weights fell on him as he ex-ercised].",
        "After extracting training instances from FrameNet, we assign them cause (c) and non-cause (?",
        "c) labels.",
        "We manually examined the inventory of labels of FrameNet and use the following scheme to assign the c or ?c to each training instance.",
        "All the annotations of FrameNet with following labels are considered as causal training instances and rest of the annotations are considered as non-causal training instances.",
        "Purpose, Internal cause, Result, External cause, Cause, Reason, Explanation, Required situation, Purpose of Event, Negative consequences, resulting ac-tion, Effect, Cause of shine, Purpose of Goods, Response action, Enabled situa-tion, Grinding cause, Trigger For this work, we have acquired 2, 158 (65, 777) cause (non-cause) training instances from FrameNet.",
        "Since, the non-cause instances are very large in number, our supervised model tends to assign non-cause labels to almost all instances.",
        "Therefore, we employ equal number of cause and non-cause instances for training.",
        "In fu-ture, we plan to extract more annotations from the FrameNet and employ more than one human annotators to assign the labels of cause and non-cause relations to the full inventory of labels of FrameNet.",

Otherwise assign non-cause label.",

        "The addition of novel types of knowledge introduced in section 3 (i.e., the model Basic+SCN M +SCV+IVN) brings 14.74% (29.57%) improvements in F-score (accuracy), respectively.",

        "We noticed that the direct objects of the verbs are mostly part of the event represented by the verbs and therefore encodes non-causation with the verbs.",
        "For example, consider following instances: 6.",
        "The hurricane surge protection failures prompted a lawsuit.",
        "7.",
        "They provided weather forecasts.",
        "In example 6, ?lawsuit?",
        "is the direct object of the verb ?prompted?",

        "Therefore, following this observation we employed the training corpus of cause and non-cause relations (see section 3.1) and learned the structure of verb-noun phrase pairs encoding non-cause relations most of the time.",
        "We considered only those training instances where the subject and/or object of the verb was available.",
        "For the current purpose, we picked up following four features (1) sub in np, (2) !sub in np, (3) obj in np and (4) !obj in np.",
        "Just to remind the reader, the feature sub in np (!sub in np) is set to 1 if the subject of the verb is (not) contained in the noun phrase np, respectively.",
        "For each of the above four features, the percentage of cause and entropy of relations with that feature are as follows: ?",
        "sub in np (%c = 34.72, Entropy = 0.931) ?",

        "!obj in np (%c = 55.30, Entropy = 0.991).",
        "There are two important observations from above scores: (1) verbs mostly encode non-cause relations with their objects and subjects (i.e., high %?c with obj in np and sub in np), (2) among obj in np and sub in np features, obj in np yields least entropy i.e., there are least chances of encoding causality of a verb with its object.",
        "Considering the above statistics, we enforce the constraint on each verb-noun phrase pair that if the object of the verb is contained in the noun phrase of the above pair then assigns non-cause relation to that pair.",
        "Using this constraint, we obtain 46.61% (80.74%) F-score (accuracy), respectively.",
        "This confirms our observation that the object of a verb is normally part of an event represented by the verb and thus it encodes non-cause relation with the verb.",
        "In this research, we have utilized novel types of knowledge to improve the performance of our model.",
        "In future, we need to consider more additional information (e.g., predictions from metonymy resolver) to achieve further progress.",
        "5 Conclusion In this paper, we have proposed a model for identifying causality in verb-noun pairs by employing the knowledge of semantic classes of nouns and verbs and the knowledge of indistinguishable noun and verb of an instance along with shallow linguistic features.",
        "Our empirical evaluation of model has revealed that such novel types of knowledge are critical to achieve a better performance on the current task.",
        "Following the encouraging results achieved by our model, we invite researchers to investigate more interesting types of knowledge in future to make further progress on the task of recognizing causality.",
