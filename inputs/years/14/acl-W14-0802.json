        "Multiword Expressions (MWEs) are an important research topic in the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP).",
        "Efficient and effective extraction and interpretation of MWEs is crucial in most NLP tasks.",
        "They exist in many types of text and cause major problems in all kinds of natural language processing applications (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "However, identifying and lexicalizing these important but hard to identify structures need to be improved in most major computational lexicons (Calzolari et al., 2002).",
        "Jackendoff (1997) estimates that the number of MWEs is equal to the number of single words in a speaker's lexicon, while Sag et al. (2002) believe that the number is even greater than this.",
        "Moreover, as a language evolves, the number of MWEs consistently increases.",
        "MWEs are a powerful way of extending languages?",
        "lexicons.",
        "Their role in language evolution is so important that according to Baldwin and Kim (2010), ?It is highly doubtful that any language would evolve without MWEs of some de-scription?.",
        "The efficient identification and extraction of MWEs can positively influence many other NLP tasks, e.g., part of speech tagging, parsing, syntactic disambiguation, semantic tagging, machine translation, and natural language generation.",
        "MWEs also have important applications outside NLP.",
        "For instance in document indexing, information retrieval (Acosta et al., 2011), and cross lingual information retrieval (Hull and Grefenstette, 1996).",
        "In this paper we present a method of extracting MWEs which is relatively different from most of the state of the art approaches.",
        "We characterize MWEs based on the statistical properties of the immediate context they occur in.",
        "For each possible MWE candidate we define a set of contextual features (e.g., prefixes, suffixes, etc.).",
        "The contextual feature vector is then enriched with a few MWE-specific features such as the frequency of its components, type frequency of the candidate MWE, and the association between these two (which is learned by a supervised model).",
        "Subsequently the MWEhood of the extracted candidates is predicted based on this feature representation, using a Support Vector Machine (SVM).",
        "The system reaches a relatively high accuracy of predicting MWEs on unseen data.",
        "1.1 Previous Work Attempts to extract MWEs are of different types.",
        "The most common techniques are primarily focused on collocations.",
        "Some of these techniques are rule-based and symbolic e.g., (Seretan, 2011; Goldman et al., 2001; Nerima et al., 2003; Bald-win, 2005; Piao et al., 2003; McCarthy et al., 2003; Jacquemin et al., 1997).",
        "Some rely on lexicons (Michiels and Dufour, 1998; Li et al., 2003) and (Pearce, 2001) that uses WordNet to evaluate the candidate MWE based on anti-collocations.",
        "Other approaches are hybrid in the sense that they benefit from both statistical and linguistic information.",
        "For instance (Seretan and Wehrli, 2006; Baldwin and Villavicencio, 2002; Piao and McEnery, 2001; Dias, 2003).",
        "There are also fully statistical approaches.",
        "For instance (Pecina, 2010; Evert, 2005; Lapata and 10 Lascarides, 2003; Smadja et al., 1996), or the early work Xtract (Smadja, 1993).",
        "Other approaches consider all types of MWEs (Zhang et al., 2006).",
        "Some of these approaches build upon generic properties of MWEs, for instance semantic non-compositionality (Van de Cruys and Moir?on, 2007).",
        "A different approach is presented in (Widdows and Dorow, 2005).",
        "The authors present a graph-based model to capture and assess fixed expressions in form of Noun and/or Noun.",
        "There are also bilingual models which are mostly based on the assumption that a translation of the MWE in a source language exists in a target language.",
        "For instance (de Medeiros Caseli et al., 2010; Ren et al., 2009), and (Moir?on and Tiedemann, 2006) which measures MWEs candi-dates?",
        "idiomaticity based on translational entropy.",
        "Another example is (Duan et al., 2009) which is a hybrid model that aims at extracting bilingual (English-Chinese) MWEs .",
        "It combines Multiple Sequence Alignment Model with some filtering based on hard rules to obtain an improved extraction.",
        "A more generic model is presented in (Ramisch, 2012) where the author develops a flexible platform that can accept different types of criteria (from statistical to deep linguistic) in order to extract and filter MWEs.",
        "However, in this work, as the author claims, the quality of the extracted MWEs is highly dependent on the level of deep linguistic analysis, and thereby, the role of statistical criterion is less significant.",
        "1.2 Motivation We propose an original method to extract multi-word expressions based on statistical contextual features, e.g., a set of immediate prefixes, suffixes, circumfixes, infixes to circumfixes, etc., (see Sec.",
        "2).",
        "These features are used to form a feature repre-sentation, which together with a set of annotations train a supervised model in order to predict and extract MWEs from a large corpus.",
        "We observed some discriminant behavior in contextual features (such as prefixes, suffixes, cir-cumfixes, etc.)",
        "of a set of manually selected MWEs.",
        "A supervised model is then applied to learn MWEhood based on these features.",
        "In general, modeling lexical and syntactic (and not semantic) characteristics of continuous MWEs is the focus of this paper.",
        "In order for the MWE decomposability condition to hold, we consider bigrams and above (up to size 4).",
        "Idiomaticity at some level is a necessary prerequisite of MWEs.",
        "Hereby, we consider idiomaticity at lexical, syntactic and statistical levels, and leave the semantic idiomaticity to the future work.",
        "Relatively similar models have been previously applied to problems similar to MWEs, for instance named entity recognition (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007; Ratinov and Roth, 2009).",
        "The focus on contextual features allows some degree of generalization, i.e., we can apply this model to a family of languages.",
        "1 However, this work focuses only on English MWEs.",
        "2 Proposed System We prepared a corpus that comprises 100K Wikipedia documents for each of the mentioned languages.",
        "1 After cleaning and segmenting the corpus, we extracted all possible n-grams (up to size 7) and their token and type frequencies.",
        "Then two basic statistical filters were applied in order to systematically decrease the size of our immense n-gram set: (i) Frequency filter, where we filter an n-gram if its frequency is less than the ratio between tokens and types, where for a given size of n-grams, the total number of n-grams and the number of distinct n-grams of that size, are considered tokens and types, respectively.",
        "(ii) Redundancy filter where we consider an n-gram to be redundant if it is subsumed by any other n ?",
        "-gram, where n ?",
        "> n. This gives us a pruned set of n-grams which we refer to as the statistically significant set.",
        "Table 1 presents a count-wise description of the filtering results on the English corpus.",
        "raw frq flt rdund flt 1-grams 1782993 64204 64204 2-grams 14573453 1117784 1085787 3-grams 38749315 3797456 3394414 4-grams 53023415 5409794 3850944 5-grams 53191941 2812650 2324912 6-grams 47249534 1384821 568645 7-grams 39991254 757606 757606 1 We are adapting our model so that it can handle clusters of similar languages.",
        "So far we have processed the following 9 widely-spoken languages: English, German, Dutch, Span-ish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, and Russian.",
        "How-ever, to study the efficiency of the presented model applied to languages other than English, remains a future work.",
        "11 Table 1: Number of extracted n-grams for EN.",
        "First column indicates raw data, second and third columns indicate the number of n-grams after frequency and redundancy filters respectively.",
        "For the set of significant n-grams a set of statistical features are extracted which will be described shortly.",
        "Fig. 1 illustrates the workflow of the system.",
        "removing tags, cleaning, segmentation Language Model 100K Wikipedia docs Corpus cleaning; extraction n-grams freq & redundancy Filters statistically significant n-grams indexing Index (MWE candidate , {|f1|,|f2|,...) feature extraction This%set%is%used%in% annotation%and%generation% of%test/training%data% Figure 1: Schematic of pre-processing, n-gram extraction and filtering.",
        "Blended and plain nodes represent resources, and operations respectively.",
        "While studying the English corpus and different MWEs therein, it was observed that often, MWEs (as well as some other types of syntactic units) are followed, preceded or surrounded by a limited number of high frequency significant n-gram types.",
        "Moreover, our manual evaluation and constituency tests reveal that generally when a frequent significant prefix co-occurs with a frequent significant suffix, they form a circumfix whose significant infixes are (i) many, (ii) can mostly be considered syntactic unit, specifically when it comes to bi/trigrams.",
        "Table 2 illustrates a randomly selected sample of infixes of such circumfix (the..of).",
        "Remarkably, the majority of them are idiomatic at least at one level.",

        "We believe it suggests the presence of a discriminant attribute that we model with features 5-8 (see Table 3) and learn using a supervised model.",
        "Nevertheless, the fact that MWEs share these features with other types of syntactic units encourages introducing more MWE-specific features (namely, MWE's frequency, the frequency of its components, and their associations), then enforcing the learning model to recognize a MWE based on the combination of these two types of features.",
        "Note that the association between the type frequency of a MWE, and the frequency of its components is implicitly learned by the supervised model throughout the learning phase.",
        "A candidate MWE can be represented as: y = (x 1 , ..., x m , x m+1 , ..., x n ) ?",
        "N 0 (1) Where x 1 , ..., x m are contextual, and x m+1 , ..., x n are specific features (m = 8, and n = 11).",

        "A suffix of y is the longest n-gram immediately after y, if any or the boundary marker #, otherwise.",
        "A circumfix (c i ?",
        "C) of y is the pair (p, s) where p and s are respectively the prefix and the suffix of a given occurrence of y.",
        "An Infix of c i is an n-gram that occurs between p and s. Components to generate candidate MWEs, filter them and extract their relevant features were very memory and CPU intensive.",
        "To address the performance issues we implemented parallel programs and ran them on a high performance cluster.",
        "3 Experimental Results A set of ?",
        "10K negative and positive English MWE examples were annotated.",
        "This set does not particularly belong in any specific genre, as the examples were chosen randomly from across a general-purpose corpus.",
        "This set comprises an equal number of positive and negative annotations.",
        "Part of it was annotated manually at UNDL foun-dation, 2 and part of it was acquired from the manually examined MWE lexicon presented in (Ner- ima et al., 2003).",
        "The set of positive and negative annotated n-grams is detailed in Table 4.",
