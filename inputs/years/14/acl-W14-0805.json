        "Abstract",
        "We report on the first, still on-going effort to integrate verb MWEs in an LFG grammar of Modern Greek (MG).",
        "Text is lemmatized and tagged with the ILSP FBT Tagger and is fed to a MWE filter that marks Words_With_Spaces in MWEs.",
        "The output is then formatted to feed an LFG/XLE grammar that has been developed independently.",
        "So far we have identified and classified about 2500 MWEs, and have processed 40% of them by manipulating only the lexicon and not the rules of the grammar.",
        "Research on MG MWEs (indicatively, Anastasiadi-Simeonidi, 1986; Fotopoulou, 1993; Mini et al., 2011) has developed collections of MWEs and discussed classification, syntax and semantics issues.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to obtain deep parses of a wide range of types of MG verb MWEs with rich syntactic structure.",
        "1 The parsing system We take advantage of the mature ILSP FBT Tagger (Papageorgiou et al., 2000) that is an adaptation of the Brill tagger trained on MG text.",
        "It uses a PAROLE compatible tagset of 584 tags.",
        "The tagger works on the output of a sentence detection and tokenisation tool and assigns a lemma and a set of tags corresponding to an exhaustive morphological analysis of tokens (Fig. 1).",
        "The tagger is a black box for our system and allows for no preprocessing of MWEs, as it would be possible if the XFST/XLE component was used (Attia, 2006).",
        "We have been working on a system that aims to move as much as possible of the parsing burden from the LFG/XLE component to a MWE recognizer (the ?filter?)",
        "at the same time allowing for ?natural?",
        "LFG analyses.",
        "Oflazer et al. (2004) discuss a similar preprocessing step but they focus on the retrieval and not on the deep parsing of verb MWEs.",
        "Our filter, implemented in Perl, scans the output of the tagger for strings containing verb MWEs and feeds a script (?formatter?)",
        "that yields a format readable by an LFG/XLE grammar.",
        "1.1 The filter lexicon The filter consults the ?filter lexicon?",
        "where each verb MWE entry is specified for the following: 1.",
        "Compositionality.",
        "Certain verb MWEs can take a compositional interpretation.",
        "For instance, the free subject, flexible (Sag et al., 2001) verbal 33 MWE ????",
        "?????",
        "?????",
        "??",
        "??",
        "??",
        "(9) has no compositional interpretation while the semi-fixed MWE ???_??????",
        "(2) ?to be beaten up?, can take the compositional interpretation ?grab/steal them-FEM?.",
        "The filter lexicon specifies which MWEs will be eventually assigned both MWE and compositional XLE parses.",
        "2.",
        "The lemmatized form of Words_With_Spaces (WWS) whether they are independent fixed MWEs or substrings of a MWE.",
        "For instance, the lemmatised WWS ??????_????",
        "would be stored for WWS ?????",
        "?????",
        "of the MWE (9).",
        "3.",
        "PoS of the WWS.",
        "For instance, we have classified the WWS ????-???-?????????",
        "?penniless and calm?",
        "(6) as adjective; however, only the second conjunct (?????????",
        "?calm?)",
        "is an adjective while the first conjunct ????",
        "is an indeclinable non-Greek word that occurs with this type of MWE only.",
        "Regarding distribution, the conjunction behaves as an adjective.",
        "In general, we have relied on distribution criteria in order to assign PoS to WWSs.",
        "4.",
        "Morphological constraints on the lemmatized constituents of a WWS that uniquely identify fixed or semi-fixed MWE substrings.",
        "For instance, for the adjective ?????",
        "in the WWS ?????",
        "?????",
        "(9) the lemma of the adjective ??????",
        "is stored together with the tags adjective-plural-accusative-neutral-basic.",
        "5.",
        "Multiple WWSs if different word orders of the same WWS occur, for instance ?????",
        "[??",
        "????",
        "???",
        "???????",
        "]WWS [gloss: drink the blood of people] and ?????",
        "[???",
        "???????",
        "??",
        "????",
        "]WWS ?takes a lot of money from people by applying force?.",
        "1.2 The filter The filter, implemented in Perl, reads the tagged sentence from an xml file (the output of the tagger), checks it for MWEs and feeds it to the formatter if no MWE or a MWE that can take a compositional interpretation is found.",
        "Strings containing MWEs are preprocessed by the filter: their fixed parts are replaced with the corresponding WWS and morphological constraints and the resulting new string is sent to the formatter.",
        "The filter can identify all word permutations available to a listed MWE.",
        "2 An outline of the LFG analysis The output of the formatter is parsed with an LFG grammar of MG.",
        "The grammar includes sublexical rules that parse the output of the tagger and ensure information flow from the tagger to XLE.",
        "The sub-lexical trees can be seen in the c-structure of Fig. 1.",
        "MG MWEs are rich in syntactic structure despite any simplifications that might result from the usage of WWSs.",
        "In agreement with Gross (1998a; 1998b) and Mini et al. (2011) who argue that MWEs and compositional structures can be treated with more or less the same grammar, we have so far manipulated only the lexicon but not the grammar rules.",
        "Identification of phrasal constituents within the MWEs relies on possible permutations and the ability of XPs to intervene between two words, thus indicating the border between two constituents.",
        "Grammatical functions are identified with diagnostics that apply to compositional expressions such as morphological marking and WH questions.",
        "The types of syntactic structure we have treated thus far are: 1.",

        "MG (indicatively, see discussion of (8)).",
        "In the immediate future, we will use the same methodology to parse the remaining types of MWE in our collection and will draw on the accumulated evidence to study the linguistic phenomena observed in verb MWEs against more general semasio-syntactic properties of MG, for instance the role of control constructions and of animacy in this language.",
        "We will consider a more sophisticated design of the filter.",
