        "Substantial research in linguistics has been devoted to the analysis and classification of MWEs from different perspectives (Fraser, 1970; Chomsky, 1980; M. Gross 1982, 1988; Ruwet, 1983; der Linden, 1992; Nunberg et al., 1994; Howarth, 1996; Jackendoff, 1997; Moon, 1998; Fellbaum, 2007).",
        "Moreover, cognitive and psycholinguistic approaches to MWEs (Lakoff, 1993; Gibbs, 1998; Glucksberg, 1993; Diakogiorgi&Fotopoulou, 2012) have accounted for their interpretation.",
        "Within the NLP community, there is a growing interest in the identification of MWEs and their robust treatment, as this seems to improve parsing accuracy (Nivre and Nilsson, 2004; Arun and Keller, 2005).",
        "In this respect, the development of large-scale, robust language resources that may be integrated in parsing systems is of paramount importance.",
        "Representation, however, of MWEs in lexica poses a number of challenges.",
        "2 Basic Notions Typically, fixed MWEs are identified and classified on the basis of semantic, lexical and morphosyntactic criteria.",
        "(M. Gross, 1982, 1987; Lamiroy, 2003), namely: ?",
        "non-compositionality: i.e., the meaning of the expression cannot be computed from the meanings of its constituents and the rules used to combine them.",
        "Nevertheless, according to (Nunberg et al., 1994), compositionality refers to the fact that the constituents of some idioms ?carry identifiable parts of the idiomatic meaning?.",
        "Variability has been further emphasised in (Hamblin and Gibbs 1999) and (Nunberg et al. 1994): fixed expressions appear in a continuum of compositionality, which ranges from expressions that are very analysable to others that are partially analysable or ultimately non-analysable.",
        "?",
        "non-substitutability: at least one of the expression constituents does not enter in alternations at the paradigmatic axis ?",
        "non-modifiability: MWEs are syntactically rigid structures, in that there are constraints concerning modification, transformations, etc.",
        "These criteria, however, do not apply in all cases in a uniform way.",
        "The variability attested brings about the notion ?degree of fixedness?",
        "(G. Gross 1996).",
        "The kind and degree of fixedness result in the classification of these expressions as fixed, semi-fixed, syntactically flexible or collocations (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "It is crucial for a satisfactory MWEs representation in a computational lexicon to provide an accurate and functional formal modelling of fixedness, variability and compositionality.",
        "In this paper, we will discuss the classification and encoding of compounds and fixed MWEs in a conceptually organised lexicon of MG. 3 The conceptual lexicon The conceptually organised lexicon that is under development (Markantonatou & Fotopoulou, 2007) capitalises on two basic notions: (a) the notion of lexical fields, along with (b) the Saussurian notion of sign and its two inseparable facets, namely, the SIGNIFIER and the SIGNIFIED as the building blocks (main classes) of the underlying ontology.",
        "43 In this sense, the intended language resource is a linguistic ontology in which words are instances in the SIGNIFIER class.",
        "At this level, morphological, syntactic and functional information about lemmas is encoded.",
        "Similarly, word meanings are instances in the SIGNIFIED class.",
        "Each instance in the SIGNIFIER class is mapped onto a concept, the latter represented as an instance in the SIGNIFIED class.",
        "The Instances of the class SIGNIFIER are specified for (a) features pertaining to lexical semantic relations (i.e, synonymy, antonymy); (b) lexical relations such as word families, allomorphs, syntactic variants etc.",
        "; and (c) morphosyntactic properties (PoS, gender, declension, argument structure, word specific information etc.).",
        "Values for these features are assigned to both single- and multi-word entries in the lexicon.",
        "MWEs are further coupled with rich linguistic information pertaining to the lexical, syntactic and semantic levels.",
        "4 Encoding MWEs in the lexicon MWEs are encoded as instances in the SIGNIFIER class of our ontology and are also mapped onto the corresponding concepts or word meanings (instances in the SIGNIFIED class).",
        "In the remaining, we focus on the encoding of MWEs as instances in the SIGNIFIER class.",
        "We cater for sub-classes corresponding to grammatical categories (verb, noun, adjective, adverb, preposition, etc) under the class SIGNIFIER in our schema.",
        "The class MWEs (as opposed to the class Simple Lexical Units) has been defined further under the verb, noun, adjective and adverb sub-classes.",
        "Syntactic configurations pertaining to each class are also represented as distinct sub-classes hierarchically organised under the verb, noun, adjective and adverb classes.",
        "Morphosyntactic properties, selectional preferences, and semantic interpretation patterns are provided for each MWE depending on the grammatical category it pertains to; encoding is based on a set of parameters represented as feature-value pairs.",
        "More precisely, a typology of Greek verbal MWEs has been defined in (Fotopoulou, 1993, Mini, 2009) (NP V NP1 NP2?)",
        "and of nominal MWEs in (Anastasiadis, 1986) (Adj N, NN?)",
        "on the basis of the lexical and syntactic configurations involved.",
        "This typology has been mapped onto a hierarchy under classes verb and noun).",
        "In our approach, the main distinction between collocations and fixed MWEs is made explicit.",
        "The degree and type of fixedness are then encoded as features.",
        "Further morphosyntactic information is also encoded depending on the grammatical category of the MWE (i.e., declension of one or more constituents, only_singular or only_plural for nouns, etc.).",
        "In this way, information that may be useful for the automatic identification and interpretation of the MWEs may be retained.",
        "Moreover, the standard set of features inherited from the class SIGNIFIER is also retained (PoS, Gender, Number, Tense, synonyms, antonyms, etc.).",
        "4.1.The encoding schema We have so far implemented an encoding schema for nominal and verbal MWEs.",
        "We aimed at encoding rich linguistic knowledge in a formal way that would be exploitable in computer applications.",
        "The two types of fixedness (collocations and fixed) are encoded as features: (a) Lexical_variance, and (b) Is_actually.",
        "The feature Lexical_variance1 has as possible values (yes or no).",
        "Collocations (assigned a yes value) are further specified with respect to alternative lemmas; these lemmas are encoded in the appropriate feature Variants.",
        "For instance, in example (1) the two alternative lemmas are ???????????",
        "and ???????????",
        ": (1) ????????",
        "(???????????",
        "/ ???????????)",
        "(=emergency (situations / circumstances)) The feature Is_actually (with possible values yes or no) encodes information about the interpretation pattern: a value yes signifies a compositional or partially compositional meaning; on the contrary, a value no denotes a non-compositional interpretation (fixed meaning).",
        "Collocations are by default assigned feature values corresponding to a compositional meaning.",
        "In these cases, the feature maintains_meaning further specifies the constituent(s) that contribute to the non-fixed interpretation of the expression.",
        "For example, the meaning of the compound in (2) is retained from the meaning of the first noun ??????",
        "(=trip), which, in turn, is the value assigned to the maintains_meaning feature: 1In our MWE classification scheme, a lexical unit is considered ?fixed?",
        "at the lemma level.",
        "This is because MG is a heavily inflected language.",
        "44 (2) ??????",
        "???????",
        "(trip lightning (=very sudden and short trip) <maintains_meaning = ??????",
        "/> Finally, the feature has_meta_meaning signifies further the constituent(s) ?",
        "if any ?",
        "bearing a figurative meaning.",
        "For example, the compound ??????",
        "???????",
        "in (2) assumes the figurative meaning of the second noun ???????",
        "(=very sudden and short-term).",
        "On the contrary, verbal and nominal expressions with a non-compositional meaning are assigned a negative value (no) for the Is_actually feature since their constituents do not contribute to a compositional meaning; therefore, the features maintains_meaning and has_meta_meaning are left empty as non-applicable.",
        "This is exemplified in (3) below; the constituents ???????",
        "(=kids?)",
        "and ????",
        "(=joy) of the expression ???????",
        "????",

        "????",

        "Information on inflected constituents if any ?",
        "is provided in the declension feature; values for only_singular and only_plural provide further morphological/usage information; when used in combination with other features (i.e, is_actually) this type of information is evidence of fixedness.",
        "Frequent co-occurrence patterns with verbs are provided in the verb_combined feature; finally, alternative nominalised forms are listed as values of the feature nominalization.",
        "The schema is presented in the table below: only singular Boolean (yes, no) only plural: Boolean (yes, no) N_declension ?1, ?2, ?1_?2, Adj_N verb_combined string Nominalization string Table 2 The encoding schema for nouns 4.3.Verbal MWEs In the typology adopted for the verbal idiomatic expressions, fixedness can be limited to only certain constituents of the sentence; a combination of fixed and non-fixed constituents in Subject or Object position is permitted.",
        "For example, in sentences (4) and (5) below, fixedness relies on the relation among the verbs and the nouns that function as Objects (direct and indirect) and as Subject respectively: (4) ????",
        "???",
        "?NP-acc, Obj ????",
        "???",

        "??",
        "????????",
        "??",
        "?NP-nom, Subj my lights are switched on (=to become very angry) Moreover, the typology allows for a restricted alternation of fixed elements of the expression.",

        "Moreover, selectional restrictions applied to the arguments (such as +/- human) are also added.",
        "The encoding schema that applies to verbal MWEs specifically is presented in Table 3.",
        "In this schema, N signifies a non-fixed noun, whereas C denotes a fixed one; number 0 (in N0 and C0) is used to represent a noun (either fixed or non-fixed in Subject position), and 1, 2, 3, etc.",

        "Discussion As it has been shown above, in our lexicon we have opted for an approach to MWE representation that builds on rich linguistic knowledge.",
        "The linguistic classifications adopted deal with morphology, syntax, and semantics interface aspects.",
        "Thus, a lexicon ?",
        "grammar representation of MWEs has been constructed by encoding key morphosyntactic and semantic information.The typology of verbal MWEs shares common characteristics with similar efforts for other languages (i.e, DuELME, Gregoire, 2010 Morphosyntactic properties and selectional preferences account better for a number of phenomena, inherent in the Greek language, as for example word order and gaps attested in running text.",
        "More specifically, Greek is a language with a relatively free word order, and idiomatic expressions often occur in texts in various configurations.",
        "The encoding of fixed and non-fixed constituents provides, therefore, extra information for the identification of expressions in texts.",
        "Moreover, the identification of MWEs as collocations entails a relatively loose fixedness, allowing, thus, for gaps and discontinuities as shown in (7): (7) ??",

        "We have so far treated nominal and verbal MWEs (~1000 entries).",
        "Future work involves the population of the lexicon with new expressions also pertaining to the grammatical categories adjective and adverb and the definition of a fine-grained typology for the latter.",
        "Moreover, a more granular representation of fixedness will be attempted.",
        "Compatibility of the resource with diverse syntactic approaches will also be investigated.",
