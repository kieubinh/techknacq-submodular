        "In contemporary linguistics the definition of those entities which are referred to as multiword expressions (MWEs) remain controversial.",
        "It is intuitively clear that some words, when appearing together, have some ?special bond?",
        "in terms of meaning (e.g. black hole, mountain chain), or lexical choice (e.g. strong tea, to fill a form), contrary to free combinations.",
        "Nevertheless, the great variety of features and anomalous behaviours that these expressions exhibit makes it difficult to organize them into categories and gave rise to a great amount of different and sometimes overlapping terminology.",
        "1 In fact, MWEs can show non-grammatical constructions, syntactic fixed-ness, morphological frozeness, semantic restric-tions, non-compositionality, strong pragmatic con-notation, etc.",
        "These features are not necessary and sufficient conditions for each expression, but represent only possible behaviours that can be exhibited together or individually and to a different extent.",
        "1 See Bartsch (2004) or Masini (2007) for an overview on the historical development of MWE terminology.",
        "Traditionally MWEs are seen as entities lying on a continuum between two poles that go from a maximum of semantic opacity (green thumb) to compositional expressions that show only lexical restrictions (to catch a cold).",
        "However the ?com- positional criterion?",
        "is a problematic concept in semantics, since it has been shown how difficult it is, in language, to define component parts, rules or functions involved in compositionality (Casadei, 1996) and, above all, that it is impossible to give words an absolute meaning independently from their context (Firth, 1957; Hanks, 2013).",
        "Because of this, the problem of subcategorizing the heterogeneous set of MWEs must be based on more reliable and testable criteria.",
        "This work presents a study conducted on the Italian language that aims at dividing MWEs in subcategories on the basis of empirical syntactic and semantic criteria different from composition-ality.",
        "We show how these features are able to separate two poles of entities which approximately correspond to what is intuitively known as multiword units (polirematiche in the Italian lexicographic tradition) 2 as opposed to (lexical) collocations.",
        "2 The need to go beyond statistics In recent years, the fact that MWE components tend to cooccur more frequently than expected led to the development of several statistical association measures 3 (AMs) in order to identify and automatically extract MWEs.",
        "However, as pointed out in Evert (2008), it is important not to confuse the empirical concept of recurrent or statistically relevant word combination in a corpus (empirical collocation) with the theoretical concept of MWE (which assumes phraseological implications), although the two sets overlap.",
        "In fact, it is common 2 cf. De Mauro (2007).",
        "3 See Evert (2004) for a general overview.",
        "77 that AMs can extract expressions such as leggere un libro ?to read a book?",
        "or storcere il naso ?to stick up [one?s] nose?",
        "just because the components tend to cooccur often in corpora.",
        "However, while the first one seems not to need its own categorical status (Bosque, 2004), the latter is usually denoted as a metaphoric MWE or idiom.",
        "AMs are not able to distinguish between the two or even differentiate subtypes of true MWEs on the basis of phraseological relevance (e.g. AMs are not able to assign a higher score to more opaque MWEs in opposition to lexical collocations).",
        "It is pos-sible, however, to integrate statistical information with the results of syntactic and semantic tests performed on corpora in order to identify subgroups of MWEs.",
        "4 3 Methodology As a first approach, in this work only Italian nominal MWE of the form [noun + adjective] 5 are chosen.",
        "The corpus used in our study is PAIS ` A 6 , a freely available large Italian corpus, composed of ca. 250 million tokens and morpho-syntactically annotated.",
        "By means of mwetoolkit (Ramisch et al., 2010) the 400 most frequent [noun + adjec-tive] bigrams are extracted from the corpus and assigned the pointwise mutual information (PMI) association score (Church and Hanks, 1990).",
        "Then the bigrams are ordered according to PMI and only the first 300 are retained.",
        "7 The number of occurrences of the expressions contained in this set varies between 20.748 and 641.",
        "Then, we implemented a computational tool that performs empirical tests on modifiability.",
        "We chose to study three features, which are a) inter-ruptibility, b) inflection and c) substitutability 8 and for each of them an index is calculated.",
        "4 The idea is not new, since already Fazly and Stevenson (2007) showed how lexical and syntactic fixedness is relevant in subcategorizing MWEs.",
        "However, their work focused only on a set of English verbal MWEs and subclasses were determined initially and not at the end of the analysis.",
        "5 This is the unmarked Italian noun phrase.",
        "6 www.corpusitaliano.it 7 The first frequency threshold is necessary since PMI tends to overestimate expressions with very low numbers of occurrences (Evert, 2008).",
        "Then, considering only the 300 best candidates increases the chances to have a majority of MWEs.",
        "In a later stage of our analysis also the top-300 candidates extracted by the log-likelihood (LL) AM (Dunning, 1993) have been considered, in order to check if the initial choice of PMI could affect somehow our results.",
        "The LL set was 66% coincident with the PMI set.",
        "However, the new expressions seem to show the same tendencies of distributions (cf.",
        "Section 4) as those in the PMI set.",
        "8 In fact, in Italian: a) some nominal MWEs do not allow Given the expression, the index of interruptibility (I i ) compares the occurrences of the sequence in its basic form [noun + adjective] (n bf ), with the occurrences of the same sequence with one word occurring between the two components (n i ).",
        "The queries are made over lemmas and its value is given by the ratio: I i = n i /(n bf + n i ).",
        "The index of inflection (I f ) compares the number of occurrences of the prevalent (most frequent) inflected form (n pf ) with those of the basic lem-matized form 9 (n bf ) and its value is given by the ratio: I f = (n bf ?",
        "n pf )/n bf .",
        "Finally, the index of substitutability (I s ) compares the number of occurrences of the basic form (n bf ), regardless of inflection, with the occurrences n s of all the sequences in which one of the two components is replaced by one of its synonyms (if present).",
        "If n s 1 ,i is the number of occurrences of the i-th synonym of the first component word and n s 2 ,i is an analogous quantity for the second component word, then n s = ?",
        "i n s 1 ,i + ?",
        "i n s 2 ,i and I s = n s /(n bf + n s ).",
        "In order to calculate I s the tool needs an external synonym list; we chose the GNU-OpenOffice Italian Thesaurus 10 because of its immediate availability, open-source nature and ease of management.",
        "11 Then the three indices are calculated for each of the 300 MWEs of the candidate list.",
        "4 Results Figure 1 shows the distribution of the expressions in the planes defined by I i , I f ,I s .",
        "It is evident that there is a tendency for the expressions to gather more along the axes rather than in the planes, i.e. where one of the indices has low values.",
        "for the insertion of other words between the components (e.g. carro armato ?tank?",
        "; cfr.",
        "*carro grande armato) while others do (e.g. punto debole ?weak point?",
        "; cf. punto pi`u debole); b) some nominal MWEs exhibit inflection frozeness (e.g. diritti umani ?human rights?",
        "; cf. *diritto umano), while others can be freely inflected (e.g. cartone animato ?cartoon?",
        "; cfr.",
        "car-toni animati); c) some nominal MWEs do not allow for the substitution of one of their components with a synonym (e.g. colonna sonora ?soundtrack?",
        "; cf. *pilastro sonoro) while others do (e.g. guerra mondiale ?world war?",
        "; cf. conflitto mon-diale).",
        "9 Although Nissim and Zaninello (2011) show how Italian nominal MWEs can exhibit several distinct morphological variations, we chose to consider only the proportion between the prevalent form and the total number of expressions since our pattern generally admits only singular and plural forms, with noun and adjective coherently coupled.",
        "10 http://linguistico.sourceforge.net/pages/thesaurus italiano.html 11 However, other more specific and complete resources could be attached instead in the future, in order to improve the quality of the results.",

        "The upper right cell is empty since all the expressions in the group I + f I + s have I i 0.1. lowing features: they can be metaphoric (catena montuosa ?mountain chain?",
        "), completely crystallized (quartier generale ?headquarter?",
        "), terminological (amministratore delegato ?managing direc-tor?",
        "), they can present an unpredictable semantic addition (gas naturale, ?natural gas?, meaning the gas provided in houses for domestic uses), or one of the components assumes a specific and unusual meaning (casa automobilistica ?car company?, lit.",
        "?car house?).",
        "Despite their variability, the entities in this group are all perceived as ?units?",
        "of meaning because the lack of one of the components makes the expressions lose their overall meaning.",
        "Finally, lexical collocations represent here those entities that are generally perceived as fully com-positional, being ?not fixed but recognizable phraseological units?",
        "(Tiberii, 2012).",
        "They exhibit the following possible features: one of the component is used only in combination with the other one (acqua potabile ?drinking water?, where potabile only refers to water), or although other synonymous words are available and could give the expression the same meaning, just one specific component word is preferred (sito ufficiale ?offi- cial site?",
        "; cf. *sito autorizzato).",
        "6 Further considerations and limits Although not reported here, expressions with values for I f , I s ?",
        "[0.1, 0.33] show continuity between the categories of Table 1.",
        "13 Moreover, since our thesaurus does not deal with sense disam-biguation, a manual check on concordances was performed.",
        "For very few metaphorical expres-sions, I s produced non-reliable values, since it can happen that, once a synonym of one component has been substituted for the original word, the new 13 E.g. intervento chirurgico ?surgery?",
        "has I f = 0.27, I s = 0.22 and I i = 0 and moves between multiword unit and lexical collocation; stile barocco ?baroque style?, with I f = 0.005, I s = 0.20 and I i = 0.07, moves between lexical collocation and free combination.",
        "expression is still highly attested in the corpus, although it has lost the original metaphorical meaning.",
        "14 In order to correct this bias in the future, the criterion of substitutability should check, for example, not only the number of attested replaced expressions, but also if they share the same context words of the basic expression.",
        "7 Conclusion and future work Our analysis shows that the intuitive distinction between two main subcategories of MWEs (multi- word units vs. lexical collocations) can be empirically reproduced by testing the syntactic and semantic behaviour of the expressions on corpora.",
        "In this way we provide an empirical criterion, related to the intuitive and hardly definable notion of com-positionality, able to attest how expressions exhibit different restrictions depending on their subcategory.",
        "Multiword units are characterized by low values of interruptibility and low values of substitutability.",
        "Lexical collocations can be more easily interrupted if they have low values of substitutabil-ity, while they do not allow for interruptibility if they have high substitutability.",
        "Since also a subgroup of free combinations is identified when intersecting the values of the indices, our methodology can be useful as well for automatic removal of false positives from MWE candidate lists.",
        "15 Future work must include the extension of the analysis to other forms of nominal MWEs as well as other grammatical categories by the development of tools which can deal with verbal or adverbial MWEs, as well as tests on different corpora.",
        "14 This is the case of braccio destro ?right-hand man?, lit.",
        "?right arm?, that could be substituted by ala destra (right wing) since both braccio and ala can refer to a part of a building.",
        "15 This consideration relates our work to that of Baldwin et al. (2003), Bannard (2007), Weller and Fritzinger (2010), Cap et al. (2013), whose goal is to implement the identification of true positive candidates by using both syntactic or semantic features and AMs.",
