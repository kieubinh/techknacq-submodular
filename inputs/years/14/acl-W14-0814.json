        "Abstract",
        "This contribution presents the newest version of our ?Wortverbindungsfelder?",
        "(fields of multi-word expressions), an experimental lexicographic resource that focusses on aspects of MWEs that are rarely addressed in traditional descriptions: Con-texts, patterns and interrelations.",
        "The MWE fields use data from a very large corpus of written German (over 6 billion word forms) and are created in a strictly corpus-based way.",
        "In addition to traditional lexicographic descriptions, they include quantitative corpus data which is structured in new ways in order to show the usage specifics.",
        "This way of looking at MWEs gives insight in the structure of language and is especially interesting for foreign language learners.",
        "1 Our concept of MWEs We study MWEs from a linguistic perspective and are mainly interested in two questions: What can we learn about the nature of MWEs and their status in language by studying large corpora?",
        "And how can we present MWEs in novel lexicographic ways that reflect our findings?",
        "The MWE field presented in this contribution is a prototype that reflects our current ideas regarding these questions.",
        "It can be explored online free of charge at http://wvonline.ids-mannheim.",
        "de/wvfelder-v3/index.html.",
        "Our approach is based on the concept ?Usuelle Wortverbindungen?",
        "(UWV, Steyer 2000; Steyer 2004; Steyer 2013), which defines MWEs as conventionalized patterns of language use that manifest themselves in recurrent syntagmatic structures.",
        "This includes not only idioms and idiosyncratic structures, but all multi-word units which have acquired a distinct function in communication.",
        "Our focus is on real-life usage, pragmatics and context.",
        "We work bottom-up in detecting and describing MWE units in a strongly corpus-driven way (Sinclair 1991; Tognini-Bonelli 2001; Hanks 2013), taking iterative steps to arrive at conclusions about language use.",
        "Methologi-cally, our approach bears some similarities to Stefanowitsch/Gries?",
        "?collostructions?",
        "(Stefanow- itsch/Gries 2003) though we are less interested in syntactic and grammatical structures as it is common in construction grammar approaches but see MWEs primarily as parts of the lexicon and feel closer to phraseology.",
        "The basis of our research is DeReKo (Deutsches Referenzkorpus, Institut f?r Deutsche Sprache 2012), the largest collection of written German available today which has over six billion word tokens and is located at the Institute for the German Language (IDS).",
        "In the current stage of our work, which is mainly explorative, we use DeReKo as it is.",
        "This means our text basis is dominated by newspaper texts from the last 10-15 years.",
        "Though this is surely not a ?balanced?",
        "corpus, we argue that it still reflects much of contemporary written language use, as newspaper texts are a medium that is widely disseminated.",
        "Though the interpretation and main analysis is done manually, automatic methods form an important basis to our work.",
        "We use a sophisticated method of collocation analysis developed at the IDS (Belica 1995) to get indications which word combinations constitute MWEs and to explore contexts in which an MWE is commonly used.",
        "In addition to that, we use a pattern matching tool developed in our project to explore and structure corpus evidence and gain further insight into the behavior and variations of MWE candidates.",
        "Our special interest lies in the fact that MWEs are not as fixed as is often assumed, but often behave as patterns and show multiple interrelations.",
        "Therefore, we also describe MWE patterns a 82 Figure 1: Part of the MWE field centered around Grund and preposition aus.",
        "more abstract form of MWEs which are only partially fixed.",
        "An example for a fixed MWE is Pi mal Daumen (pi times thumb - ?approximately?",
        "), a multi-word expression that is always used in exactly this form.",
        "MWE patterns on the other hand consist of fixed lexical components as well as slots that can be filled in different ways.",
        "In spite of this variability, the whole pattern has a holistic meaning and function.",
        "An example is the expression wie NOUN in jemandes Ohren klingen (to sound like NOUN in someone's ears - ?to be perceived in a certain way?",
        "(specified by NOUN)).",
        "The NOUN slot can be filled with different words in order to specify the general meaning of the pattern.",
        "In section 2.3 we will go into further detail about how a slot in an MWE pattern can be filled.",
        "The MWE field presented in this contribution centers around the word Grund (rea- son/basis/foundation) combined with several prepositions.",
        "It is the newest of several versions of MWE fields which have been described elsewhere (cf. Brunner/Steyer 2009; Brunner/ Steyer 2010) and are available at our website http://wvonline.ids-mannheim.de as well.",
        "This newest version focusses more on hierarchies of MWEs and MWE patterns and incorporates additional resources like collocation analyses in its descriptive texts.",
        "In the following, we will highlight some features of the MWE field which illustrate our focus on interrelations, contexts and patterns.",
        "2 MWE field Grund 2.1 Interrelations Figure 1 shows a part of the MWE field, centered on the word Grund and preposition aus.",
        "Each node is linked to a lexicographic description.",
        "Figure 2 presents a screenshot of one of those articles.",
        "In addition to narrative descriptions and manually selected usage examples from our corpus, the articles also include components that are derived from quantitative corpus data.",
        "Specifically, these are collocation analyses as well as filler tables for MWE patterns.",
        "The function of these components will be explained in more detail in sections 2.2 and 2.3.",
        "In Figure 1, you can observe the relations between MWEs (thick border) and MWE patterns (regular border).",
        "The nodes with the dashed border represent repeating surface structures which themselves have no common holistic meaning but show the lexical interconnectedness between the MWEs and MWE patterns.",
        "All nodes enclosed in the square field contain the elements Grund and auf.",
        "The nodes on the far right are extensions which do not belong to the core of the MWE field as it was defined, but are connected lexically and functionally to MWEs that do.",
        "We decided to include those ?external nodes?",
        "to give a glimpse of how the building blocks of language connect even beyond the artificial borders that where necessary when defining the MWE field.",
        "83 Figure 2: MWE article Aus welchen Gr?nden auch immer from the MWE field Grund.",
        "The article parts are ?Frequency in the Corpus?, ?General description?, ?Context Analysis?, ?Contrast Analysis?",
        "and ?Su- perordinated Nodes?.",
        "The part ?Context Analysis?",
        "contains links to a filler table and to the corresponding KWIC lines.",
        "In this example the core field contains the MWEs aus welchem Grund auch immer and aus welchen Gr?nden auch immer ( -- for whatever rea-son/s?).",
        "However, the lexical components auch immer are part of more general patterns as well.",
        "The word form Grund can be substituted by different nouns in the MWE pattern aus welch-SUB-G auch immer (e.g. Motiv (motive), Richtung (di- rection)).",
        "In the MWE pattern PRON auch immer the place is taken by an interrogative pronoun (e.g. was (what), wo (where), wer (who), warum (why)).",
        "One of those pronoun fillers, wie (how), is much more frequent than the others, which justifies the definition of a separate MWE wie auch immer, which can be translated as ?howsoever?",
        "or ?to whatever extent?",
        "(see section 2.3 for more de-tails).",
        "The basic structure of the MWE field thus highlights the different degrees of abstraction of MWEs and the functional use of lexical clusters like auch immer.",
        "The lexicographic descriptions linked to the nodes explain the interrelations and the differences in usage and meaning.",
        "2.2 Contexts Another important aspect of our approach to MWEs is that we pay close attention to the contexts in which they are commonly used.",
        "A good tool to explore this empirically is collocation analysis.",
        "In addition to narrative descriptions and manually selected corpus examples we therefore include the results of collocation analysis in our articles.",
        "One interesting aspect is the difference between 84 Figure 3: Highest ranking results of the collocation analysis for eigentlich (scope: 5 words in front).",
        "MWEs and their single-lexeme quasi-synonyms.",
        "For example the meaning of the MWE im Grunde is very close to the lexeme eigentlich (actually).",
        "Figures 3 and 4 show the highest ranking results of a collocation analysis that focusses on a window of five words in front of the units eigentlich and im Grunde respectively and calculates the log likelihood ratio.",
        "1 When comparing the results for these two units you can see that there are some contexts that are strongly preferred by eigentlich but are not highly ranked for im Grunde.",
        "Notable are the combination schade eigentlich (sad actually) as well as combinations with interrogative adverbs like wie (how), was (what), warum (why).",
        "The MWE im Grunde, on the other hand, has strong collocation partners that are capitalized conjunctions like aber (but) or denn (because).",
        "This indicates a clear tendency to appear near the beginning of a sentence in contexts where an argument is made, which is not prominent for eigentlich.",
        "So even if a quasi-synonymous single lexeme exists, the MWE shows differences in usage which become apparent when studying large quantities of data.",
        "1 For details on the collocation analysis used here see Perkuhn/Belica 2004.",
        "The settings were: Korpus: W-gesamt alle Korpora des Archivs W (mit Neuakquisitionen); Archiv-Release: Deutsches Referenzkorpus (DeReKo-2013- II); Analyse-Kontext : 5.",
        "Wort links bis 0.",
        "Wort rechts; Gran-ularit?t: grob; Zuverl?ssigkeit: analytisch; Clusterzuord-nung: mehrfach; Auf 1 Satz beschr?nkt: ja; Lemmatisierung: nein; Funktionsw?rter: zugelassen; Autofokus: aus 2.3 Patterns As mentioned before, MWE patterns are of special interest to us.",
        "When exploring MWEs, we use a pattern matching tool that allows us to search large quantities of keyword in context lines (KWICs) for combinations of fixed strings and slots.",
        "The lexical fillers of these slots can also be counted and presented in the form of frequency tables.",
        "This allows us to explore which kinds of variations are possible and typical for an MWE.",
        "The filler tables can show quite different ?profiles?",
        "for a slot.",
        "In the following, we will give some examples.",
        "For the MWE aus welchen Gr?nden auch immer (for whatever reasons) we checked whether the element Gr?nden can be modified by searching for the pattern aus welchen # * Gr?nden auch immer (# * stands for a slot that can be filled by any number of words).",
        "Table 1 shows the absolute and relative frequencies that where calculated from KWIC lines of our corpus.",
        "In the vast majority of cases, the slot is empty, which means that the MWE is used exactly in the form cited above: aus welchen Gr?nden auch immer.",
        "It is thus very stable, though not completely inflexible, as there is also evidence of adjectives that are used to further specify the reasons in question, e.g. per-s?nlichen Gr?nden (personal reasons).",
        "A different example of filler behavior can be observed when studying the pattern # auch immer (# marks a slot that has to be filled with exactly one word).",
        "Table 2 shows that this slot 85 Figure 4: Highest ranking results of the collocation analysis for im Grunde (scope: 5 words in front).",

        "You can see that filler tables are very useful for different purposes: To confirm the fixedness of an MWE and explore occasional variations, to conceptualize lexical units in order to build up hierar-chies, and to further describe and understand the behavior of MWE patterns.",
