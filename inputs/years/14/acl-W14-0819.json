        "We introduce a simple and effective cross-lingual approach to identifying collocations.",
        "This approach is based on the observation that true collocations, which cannot be translated word for word, will exhibit very different association scores before and after literal translation.",
        "Our experiments in Japanese demonstrate that our cross-lingual association measure can successfully exploit the combination of bilingual dictionary and large monolingual cor-pora, outperforming monolingual association measures."

        "Collocations are part of the wide range of linguistic phenomena such as idioms (kick the bucket), compounds (single-mind) and fixed phrases (by and large) defined as Multiword Expressions (MWEs).",
        "MWEs, and collocations, in particu-lar, are very pervasive not only in English, but in other languages as well.",
        "Although handling MWEs properly is crucial in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, manually annotating them is a very costly and time consuming task.",
        "The main goal of this work-in-progress is, therefore, to evaluate the effectiveness of a simple cross-lingual approach that allows us to automatically identify collocations in a corpus and subsequently distinguish them according to one of their intrinsic properties: the meaning of the expression cannot be predicted from the meaning of the parts, i.e. they are characterized by limited compositionality (Manning and Sch?utze, 1999).",
        "Given an ex-pression, we predict whether the expression(s) resulted from the word by word translation is also commonly used in another language.",
        "If not, that might be evidence that the original expression is a collocation (or an idiom).",
        "This can be captured by the ratio of association scores, assigned by association measures, in the target vs. source language.",
        "The results indicate that our method improves the precision comparing with standard methods of MWE identification through monolingual association measures.",
        "2 Related Work Most previous works on MWEs and, more specifi-cally, collocation identification (Evert, 2008; Sere-tan, 2011; Pecina, 2010; Ramisch, 2012) employ a standard methodology consisting of two steps: 1) candidate extraction, where candidates are extracted based on n-grams or morphosyntactic patterns and 2) candidate filtering, where association measures are applied to rank the candidates based on association scores and consequently remove noise.",
        "One drawback of such method is that association measures might not be able to perform a clear-cut distinction between collocation and non-collocations, since they only assign scores based on statistical evidence, such as co-occurrence frequency in the corpus.",
        "Our cross-lingual association measure ameliorates this problem by exploiting both corpora in two languages, one of which may be large.",
        "A few studies have attempted to identify non-compositional MWE's using parallel corpora and dictionaries.",
        "Melamed (1997) investigates how non-compositional compounds can be detected from parallel corpus by identifying translation divergences in the component words.",
        "Pichotta and DeNero (2013) analyses the frequency statistics of an expression and its component words, using many bilingual corpora to identifying phrasal verbs in English.",
        "The disadvantage of such approach is that large-scale parallel corpora is available for only a few language pairs.",
        "On the other hand, monolingual data is largely and freely available for many languages.",
        "Our approach requires only a bilingual dictionary and non-parallel monolingual corpora in both languages.",
        "109 Salehi and Cook (2013) predict the degree of compositionality using the string distance between the automatic translation into multiple languages of an expression and the individual translation of its components.",
        "They use an online database called Panlex (Baldwin et al., 2010), that can translate words and expressions from English into many languages.",
        "Tsvetkov and Wintner (2013) is probably the closest work to ours.",
        "They trained a Bayesian Network for identfying MWE's and one of the features used is a binary feature that assumes value is 1 if the literal translation of the MWE candidate occurs more than 5 times in a large English corpus.",
        "3 Identifying Collocations In this research, we predict whether the expres-sion(s) resulted from the translation of the components of a Japanese collocation candidate is/are also commonly used in English.",
        "For instance, if we translate the Japanese collocation ????",
        "?",
        "mendou-wo-miru ?to care for someone?",
        "(care- ?-see)1 into English word by word, we obtain ?see care?, which sounds awkward and may not appear in an English corpus very often.",
        "On the other hand, the word to word translation of the free combination ?????",
        "eiga-wo-miru ?to see a movie?",
        "(movie-?-see) is more prone to appear in an English corpus, since it corresponds to the translation of the expression as well.",
        "In our work, we focus on noun-verb expressions in Japanese.",
        "Our proposed method consists of three steps: 1) Candidate Extraction: We focus on noun-verb constructions in Japanese.",
        "We work with three construction types: object-verb, subject-verb and dative-verb constructions, represented respectively as ?noun wo verb (noun-?-verb)?, ?noun ga verb (noun-?-verb)?",
        "and ?noun ni verb (noun-?- verb)?, respectively.",
        "The candidates are extracted from a Japanese corpus using a dependency parser (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002) and ranked by frequency.",
        "2) Translation of the component words: for each noun-verb candidate, we automatically obtain all the possible English literal translations of the noun and the verb using a Japanese/English dictionary.",
        "Using that information, all the possible verb-noun combinations in English are then generated.",
        "For instance, for the candidate ??",
        "1 In Japanese,?",
        "is a case marker that indicates the object-verb dependency relation.",
        "??",
        "hon-wo-kau ?to buy a book?",
        "(buy-?-book), we take the noun ?",
        "hon and the verb ??",
        "kau and check their translation given in the dictionary.",
        "?",
        "has translations like ?book?, ?main?",
        "and ?head?",
        "and ??",
        "is translated as ?buy?.",
        "Based on that, possible combinations are ?buy book?",
        "or ?buy main?",
        "(we filter out determiners, pronouns, etc.).",
        "3) Ranking of original and derived word to word translated expression: we compare the association score of the original expression in Japanese (calculated using a Japanese corpus) and its corresponding derived word to word translated expressions.",
        "If the original expression has a much higher score than its literal translations, it might be a good evidence that we are dealing with a collo-cation, instead of a free combination.",
        "There is no defined criteria in choosing one particular association measure when applying it in a specific task, since different measures highlight different aspects of collocativity (Evert, 2008).",
        "A state-of-the-art, language independent framework that employs the standard methodology to identify MWEs is mwetoolkit (Ramisch, 2012).",
        "It ranks the extracted candidates using four different association measures: log-likelihood-ratio, Dice co-efficient, pointwise mutual information and Stu-dent's t-score.",
        "We previously conducted experiments with these four measures for Japanese (results are ommited), and Dice coefficient performed best.",
        "Using Dice coefficient, we calculate the ratio between the score of the original expression and the average score of its literal translations.",
        "Finally, the candidates are ranked by the ratio value.",
        "Those that have a high value are expected to be collocations, while those with a low value are expected to be free combinations.",
        "4 Experiment Setup 4.1 Data Set The following resources were used in our experi-ments: Japanese/English dictionary: we used Edict (Breen, 1995), a freely available Japanese/English Dictionary in machine-readable form, containing 110,424 entries.",
        "This dictionary was used to find all the possible translations of each Japanese word involved in the candidate (noun and verb).",
        "For our test set, all the words were covered by the dictionary.",
        "We obtained an average of 4.5 translations per word.",
        "All the translations that contains more 110 than three words are filtered out.",

        "In the future work, we are interested in increasing the size of the corpus and test set used (for instance, include mid to low frequent MWE?s), as well as applying our method to other collo-cational patterns like Noun-Adjective, Adjective-Noun, Adverb-Verb, in order to verify our approach.",
        "We also believe that our approach can be used for other languages as well.",
        "We intend to conduct a further investigation on how we can differentiate collocations from idioms.",
