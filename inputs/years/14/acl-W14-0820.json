        "Arabic Modal Multiword Expressions (AM- MWEs) are complex constructions that convey modality senses.",
        "We define seven modality senses, based on Palmer's (2001) cross-lingual typology, which are (un)certainty, evidentiality, obligation, permission, commitment, ability and volition.",
        "AM-MWEs range from completely fixed, idiomatic and sometimes semantically-opaque expressions, to morphologically, syntactically and/or lexical productive constructions.",
        "As a result, the identification and extraction of AM-MWEs have to rely on both a lexicon and a repository of their variation patterns.",
        "To-date and to the best of our knowledge, neither resource is available.",
        "Furthermore, AM-MWEs are quite understudied despite the extensive research on general-purpose Arabic MWEs.",
        "To build both the lexicon and the repository, we design a four-stage unsupervised method.",
        "Stage 1, we use Log-Likelihood Ratio and a root-based procedure to extract candidate AM-MWEs from large Arabic corpora.",
        "Stage 2, we use token level features with k-means clustering to construct two clusters.",
        "Stage 3, from the clustering output we extract patterns that describe the morphological, syntactic and semantic variations of AM-MWEs, and store 1 Both resources are available at http://www.rania-alsabbagh.com/am-mwe.html them in the pattern repository.",
        "Stage 4, we use the most frequent variation patterns to bootstrap low-frequency and new AM-MWEs.",
        "The final lexicon and repository are manually inspected.",
        "Both resources are made publicly available.",
        "The contributions of this paper are: (1) we address the lack of lexica and annotated resources for Arabic linguistic modality; and hence, we support NLP applications and domains that use modality to identify (un)certainty (Diab et al. 2009), detect power relations (Prabhakaran and Rambow 2013), retrieve politeness markers (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. 2013), extract and reconstruct storylines (Pareti et al. 2013) and classify request-based emails (Lampert et al. 2010); (2) we provide both a lexicon and a repository of variation patterns to help increase recall while keeping precision high for the automatic identification and extraction of productive AM-MWEs; and (3) we explore the morphological, syntactic and lexical properties of the understudied AM-MWEs.",
        "For the rest of this paper, Section 2 defines AM-MWEs.",
        "Section 3 outlines related work.",
        "Sections 4 describes our unsupervised method.",
        "Section 5 describes manual verification and the final resulting resources.",

        "In the literature of modality, it is referred to as quasi-modals (i.e. modals that subcategorize for prepositions).",
        "Type 3 comprises lexically productive expressions whose meanings rely on the head noun, adjective or verb.",
        "If the head word is replaced by another of the same grammatical category but a different meaning, the meaning of the entire expression changes.",

        "Type 4 comprises syntactically productive expressions.",
        "It is similar to Type 3 except that the head words are modifiable and their arguments, especially indirect objects, can be included within the boundaries of the MWE.",
        "Thus, the same expression from Type 3 can be modified as in ??",
        "???",
        "??",
        "???????",
        "mn AlDrwry jdA An (it is very necessary to).",

        "ldy nyp An (I have an intention to).",
        "Despite the semantic transparency and the morpho-syntactic and lexical productivity of the expressions in Types 3-5, we have three reasons to consider them as AM-MWEs: First, although the head words in those expressions are transparent and productive, the other components, including prepositions, relative adverbials and verbs, are fixed and conventionalized.",
        "In ??",
        "???????",

        "ydfEny (pushes/drives me).",
        "Second, each of those expressions has a strictly fixed word order.",
        "Even for expressions that allow the insertion of modifiers and verb/noun arguments, the inserted elements hold fixed places within the boundaries of the expression.",
        "Complex constructions that adhere to strict constraints on word order but undergo lexical variation are classified by Sag et al. (2002) as semi-fixed MWEs.",
        "Finally, each expression of those types is lexically perceived as a one linguistic unit that can be replaced in many contexts by a unigram synonym as illustrated in Table 1.",
        "According to Stubbs (2007) and Escart?n et al. (2013), the perception of complex constructions as single linguistic units is characteristic of MWEs.",

        "Yet, no prior work has focused on AM-MWEs.",

        "Similar to our research, their motivation to represent the productivity of Romance MWEs through variation patterns is to boost their automatic identification and extraction.",
        "Another similarity is that we define variation patterns as part-of-speech sequences.",
        "The difference between their research and ours is that our variation patterns have a wider scope because we cover both the morpho-syntactic and lexical variations of AM-MWEs, whereas their variation patterns deal with morphological variation only.",

        "The extraction of candidate AM-MWEs is conducted in three steps: Step 1: we use root-based information to identify the words that can be possible derivations of modality roots.",
        "For modality roots, we use the Arabic Modality Lexicon from Al-Sabbagh et al. (2013).",
        "In order to identify possible derivations of modality roots, we use RegExps.",
        "For instance, we use the RegExp (\\w*)m(\\w*)k(\\w*)n(\\w*) to identify words such as ??????",
        "Almmkn (the possible), ?????",
        "Atmkn (I manage) and ???????",
        "bAmkAny (I can) which convey modality.",

        "Yet, the procedure still filters out many irrelevant words that have nothing to do with the modality roots.",
        "Step 2: for the resulting words from Step 1, we extract bigrams, trigrams and quadrigrams given the frequency thresholds of 20, 15 and 10, respectively.",
        "116 In previous literature on MWEs with corpora of 6-8M words, thresholds were set to 5, 8 and 10 for MWEs of different sizes.",
        "Given the large size of our corpus, we decide to use higher thresholds.",
        "Step 3: for the extracted ngrams we use the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) to measure the significance of association between the ngram words.",
        "LLR measures the deviation between the observed data and what would be expected if the words within the ngram were independent.",
        "Its results are easily interpretable: the higher the score, the less evidence there is in favor of concluding that the words are independent.",
        "LLR is computed as in Eq. 1 where Oij and Eij are the observed and expected frequencies, respectively3.",
        "LLR is not, however, the only measure used in the literature of MWEs.",
        "Experimenting with more association measures is left for future work.",
        "Eq. 1: LLR = 2 ?",
        "O log Table 3 shows the unique type counts of the extracted ngrams.",
        "The extracted ngrams include both modal and non-modal MWEs.",
        "For instance, both ??",
        "??????",
        "???",
        "??",
        "mn Almmkn lnA An (it is possible for us to) and ??",

        "Both are frequent enough to meet the frequency threshold.",
        "The words within each quadrigram are found to be significantly associated according to LLR.",
        "Nevertheless, mn Almmkn lnA An is an AM-MWE according to our definition in Section 2, but fy Aqrb wqt mmkn is not.",
        "This is because the former conveys the modality sense of possibility; whereas the latter does not.",
        "Therefore, we need the second clustering stage in our unsupervised method to distinguish modal from non-modal MWEs.",

        "4.2 Clustering AM-MWEs Clustering is the second stage of our unsupervised method to build the lexicon of the AM-MWEs and the repository of their variation patterns.",
        "This stage takes as input the extracted ngrams from the first extraction stage; and aims to distinguish between the ngrams that convey modality senses and the ngrams that do not.",
        "4.2.1 Clustering Set-up The clustering feature set includes token level morphological, syntactic, lexical and positional features.",
        "It also has a mixture of nominal and continuous-valued features as we explain in the subsequent sections.",
        "4.2.1.1 Morphological Features Roots used to guide the extraction of candidate AM-MWEs in Section 4.1.2 are used as clustering morphological features.",

        "Consequently, to inform the clustering algorithm that a given ngram was extracted based on the root D-r-r indicates that it is more likely to be an AM-MWE.",
        "4.2.1.2 Syntactic Features In theoretical linguistics, linguists claim that Arabic modality triggers (i.e. words and phrases that convey modality senses) subcategorize for clauses, verb phrases, to-infinitives and deverbal nouns.",
        "For details, we refer the reader to Mitchell and Al-Hassan (1994), Brustad (2000), Badawi et al. (2004) and Moshref (2012).",
        "These subcategorization frames can be partially captured at the token level.",
        "For example, clauses can be marked by complementizers, subject and demonstrative pronouns and verbs.",
        "To-infinitives in Arabic are typically marked by ??",
        "An (to).",
        "Even deverbal nouns can be detected with some POS tagsets such as Buckwalter's (2002) that labels them as NOUN.VN.",
        "Based on this, we use the POS information around the extracted ngrams as contextual syntactic features for clustering.",
        "We limit the 117 window size of the contextual syntactic features to ?1 words.",
        "Furthermore, as we mentioned in Section 2, we define AM-MWEs as expressions with fixed word order.",
        "That is, the sequence of the POS tags that represent the internal structure of the extracted ngrams can be used as syntactic features to distinguish modal from non-modal MWEs.",
        "4.2.1.3 Lexical Features As we mentioned in Section 2, except for the head words of the AM-MWEs, other components are usually fixed and conventionalized.",
        "Therefore, the actual lexical words of the extracted ngrams can be distinguishing features for AM-MWEs.",
        "4.2.1.4 Positional Features AM-MWEs, especially trigrams and quadrigrams that scope over entire clauses, are expected to come in sentence-initial positions.",
        "Thus we use @beg (i.e. at beginning) to mark whether the extracted ngrams occur at sentence-initial positions.",
        "4.2.1.5 Continuous Features Except for nominal morphological and lexical features, other features are continuous.",
        "They are not extracted per ngram instance, but are defined as weighted features across all the instances of a target ngram.",
        "Thus, @beg for ngrami is the probability of ngrami to occur in a sentence-initial position.",
        "It is computed as the frequency of ngrami occurring at a sentence-initial position normalized by the total number n of ngrami in the corpus.",
        "Similarly, POS features are continuous.",
        "For instance, the probability that ngrami is followed by a deverbal noun is the frequency of its POS+1 tagged as a deverbal noun normalized by the total number n of ngrami in the corpus.",
        "4.2.2 Clustering Resources As we mentioned earlier, the extracted ngrams from the extraction stage are the input for this clustering stage.",
        "The root features are the same roots used for extraction.",
        "The POS features are extracted based on the output of MADAMIRA (Pasha et al. 2014) that is used to preprocess the corpus Section 4.1.1.",
        "The positional features are determined based on the availability of punctuation markers for sentence boundaries.",
        "We implement k-means clustering with k set to two and the distance metric set to the Euclidean distance4.",
        "The intuition for using k-means clustering is that we want to identify AM-MWEs against all other types of MWEs based on their morpho-syntactic, lexical and positional features.",
        "Thus the results of k-means clustering with k set to two will be easily interpretable.",
