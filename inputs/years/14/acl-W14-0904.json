        "Abstract",
        "The representation of temporal information in text represents a significant computational challenge.",
        "The problem is particularly acute in the case of literary texts, which tend to be massively underspeci-fied, often relying on a network of semantic relations to establish times and timings.",
        "This paper shows how a model based on threaded directed acyclic graphs makes it possible to capture a range of subtle temporal information in this type of text and argues for an onomasiological approach which places meaning before form.",
        "1 Time and Text This paper deals with the representation of temporal phenomena in literary texts.",
        "As a result, it builds on work from a number of fields.",
        "1 Thus, it takes as given the longstanding observation from philosophy that time is not a simple issue of days, months and years, but reflects issues of perception and culture (Ricoeur, 1983).",
        "At the same time, it assumes that the study of temporal phenomena will be enhanced by use of a formal representation (Allen, 1984).",
        "It further assumes the traditional narratological distinction between the information which underlies a text, variously known as the fab-ula or histoire and which we will henceforth call the story and some particular instantiation of this in text, often called the sjuzhet or r?ecit, which we will henceforth call the narrative (Genette, 1972).",
        "Mani (2010), based on earlier work, suggests that the temporal relations BEFORE, DURING, IMMEDIATELY BEFORE, BEGINS, ENDS, SIMULTANEOUS AND OVERLAPS are adequate for representing time in human languages.",
        "This raises the interesting empirical question of how 1 In what follows, for lack of space, we restrict ourselves to citing some typical examples from a vast literature.",
        "well this model applies to literary texts, given their complex but typically underspecified nature.",
        "In fact, in the case of time, a literary text often gives no explicit indication of temporal phenomena, but relies on encyclopedic knowledge available to the reader.",
        "In addition, we might ask how different temporal relations are distributed across literary texts, as compared with what is found in expository or other types of texts, or simpler narratives.",
        "At the same time, as Lascarides and Asher (1991) point out, it is important to see temporal relations as a subset of a broader range of relations including Narration, Explanation, Background, and Re-sult, all of which have temporal implications.",
        "There does exist a growing body of analyses of narrative texts, but most of these are based on relatively simple third person narratives such as fables.",
        "Such texts tend to be event-driven (one thing follows another) and they tend to lack more complex literary phenomena such as first person narra-tive, where all information is not known, multiple, sometimes competing, perspectives, and significant temporal shifts.",
        "It will be important to analyse literary texts in their full complexity before we are capable of pronouncing on the use of time.",
        "This will no doubt be aided by research on narrative generation, such as (Callaway and Lester, 2002), (Riedl and Young, 2012), and (Montfort, 2007), where temporal representations at the abstract level are made use of, but this must be complemented by empirical work on actual texts.",
        "The empirical study of temporal relations in complex literary texts will be complicated by the fact that, despite recent progress (for example, Kolomiyets et al. (2012)), parsers still do not match the performance of humans in assigning temporal points and relations.",
        "As a result, building a detailed corpus of literary texts will still take some time and much human effort.",
        "When it is undertaken, one of the fundamental decisions to be faced will be what is to be represented.",
        "Most 25 work to date takes texts themselves as the object of tagging, and schemes such as TimeML (Puste- jovsky et al., 2003) are designed to allow quite precise temporal information to be added to texts in the form of markup.",
        "As a result, they focus on phenomena in the narrative rather than in the story.",
        "To put this another way, they adopt a semasiological perspective (from form to meaning), rather than an onomasiological one (from meaning to form) (Baldinger, 1964).",
        "However, it is reasonable to ask whether the appropriate level of representation should in fact be one level up, at the level of the story.",
        "We argue here that this is the case.",
        "Elson (2012) takes a first step in this direction by mapping the textual layer to a propositional layer; however, most of the texts he deals with are relatively simple.",
        "We will show below how, in some complex examples, representing temporal phenomena at the story level requires at the least additional ?machinery?",
        "based on multiple points of view, temporal shifts including prolepsis, and encyclopedic knowledge, but that it also offers insights into narrative structure not apparent at the textual level.",
        "2 DAGs and Threading The story which underlies a literary text may be represented by means of a directed acyclic graph, henceforth DAG, composed of nodes connected by unidirectional edges.",
        "The acyclicity requires that no sequence of edges may return to an earlier node.",
        "The nodes carry segments of meaning represented by semantic expressions.",
        "These are functional representations, described in (Levison et al., 2012).",
        "Each semantic expression is composed of elements drawn from a semantic lexicon.",
        "A simple example might be stab(brutus, caesar), where the two entities brutus and caesar denote certain human beings, and stab is a function which takes two entities and returns a completion 2 having the obvious meaning.",
        "On the basis of functions such as these, it is possible to construct the DAG shown in Fig. 1.",
        "3 The unidirectional edges between the various 2 A completion may be thought of as the semantic equivalent of an utterance, an entity as the semantic equivalent of a noun, and an action as the semantic equivalent of a verb.",
        "3 The DAGs shown here were constructed with yEd (http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_ about.html), which generates a GraphML representation for each graph.",
        "For simplicity, we have ignored representation of tense and aspect in these examples, although the formalism permits this.",
        "Figure 1: A DAG for the various states of Caesar nodes represent semantic dependency, that is, the fact that subsequent nodes depend upon information contained in previous nodes, and by transitive closure, parents of previous nodes.",
        "So, in Fig. 1, the expression stab(brutus, caesar) depends on the fact that Caesar is at the Senate, while Caesar being dead depends on the stabbing.",
        "The relation carried by edges may be one of order (one node occurs before another), or of some sort of causality, whereby a subsequent node is made possible by a previous node.",
        "In addition, nodes which convey a coarse level of meaning may themselves be refined into DAGs at a finer level.",
        "And so on, recursively.",
        "Since a DAG exists prior to any text which represents it, a text may begin at the start of the DAG and follow the nodes, as in Caesar arrived at the Senate, then Brutus stabbed him, then he died, or alternatively at the end, as in Caesar died because Brutus stabbed him after his arrival at the Senate, in the middle, as in Brutus stabbed Caesar after he arrived at the Senate, and then he died, or even in a zigzag order, as in Caesar arrived at the Senate and then died because Brutus stabbed him.",
        "4 Each of these narrations may be represented by a sequence of nodes, in other words, a thread, showing the order in which the meaning carried by the nodes is presented to the reader.",
        "Note that the thread passes through some or all of the nodes, but need not follow the edges of the DAG.",
        "Nor is it constrained to be acyclic: it may visit the same node more than once.",
        "An example of this is provided by a narration in which the same event is recounted twice.",
        "To take an extreme case, in the movie Groundhog Day (http://www.imdb.",
        "com/title/tt0107048/), the character Phil relives the same day and its events many times.",
        "In our DAGs, we represent threads by a dot-4 For more examples, see (Mani, 2012).",
        "26 ted line to distinguish them from the edges of the DAG.",
        "By threading coarse or refined DAGs, the narration can be at different levels of detail.",
        "In ad-dition, a single DAG may be traversed by multiple threads representing, among other things, different points of view.",
        "So, for example, suppose that a third party, say Livia, finds Caesar's dead body, observes the stab wounds, and concludes that a previously living Caesar has been killed.",
        "From the point of view of the Livia thread, the ?Caesar is dead?",
        "node is traversed before the stabbing node (although from Livia's point of view, it may not be clear who has done the stabbing).",
        "Alternatively, a fourth character may observe a stabbing in the distance, then on approach note that the stabbee is Caesar, assumed alive until that point, and finally learn that Caesar is dead.",
        "3 Relative and Absolute Timestamps Within the DAG model, the simple chronological ordering of events or activities requires no extra features except perhaps ?colouring?",
        "certain edges to distinguish between those which denote chronological dependence and those whose dependence is based on other reasons.",
        "Figure 1 above illustrates this.",
        "However, more complex temporal relationships such as ?while?",
        "can be signified by nodes indicating relative or absolute times, as in: reltime(7) {relative time} exacttime(0900, 5, Mar, 2013) {exact time} Consider, for example, the DAG shown in Fig. 2.",
        "Here, both event1 and event2 take place after reltime(7) and before reltime(8).",
        "5 If no other activities take place in the same context, we might conclude that while event1 was taking place, event2 was happening elsewhere.",
        "Both events conclude before event4.",
        "In addition, event3 occurs after event1, but it may have started before or after reltime(8); and there is no information about its relation to event4.",
        "Additional arguments can be added to specify whether an event is durative or punctual, because nothing says that event1 actually began at reltime(7) and ended at reltime(8).",
        "The function exacttime() allows us to anchor parts of the DAG at, or more precisely after, specific moments.",
        "5 The parameters to reltime, by the way, are irrelevant; they are included only for the purposes of this commentary.",
        "Figure 2: A DAG showing relative times and events 4 Some Empirical Tests of the Formalism To empirically test the model proposed here, we will examine several actual texts.",
        "Of course, these represent only a small selection of a vast range of temporal phenomena.",
        "Our object is simply to show how the proposed model may be applied.",
        "4.1 Prolepsis As noted earlier, a literary text may bring into play a variety of perspectives.",
        "One of these is pro-lepsis, or foreknowledge of a future event.",
        "Consider the following example from Homer's Iliad.",
        "6 Achilles asks Zeus for success in a battle and that Patroclus survive the battle.",
        "Zeus grants the first wish, but not the second.",
        "7 As a result, he (Zeus) and by extension, we, as readers, know that Patroclus will die.",
        "However Patroclus himself is unaware of this.",
        "We may represent this part of the story by means of the DAG shown in Fig. 3, which contains two sets of dependencies, one which links Zeus to the decision that Patroclus will die, and the other which links Patroclus to his fighting and dying.",
        "We may then capture the temporality of the narrative by threading this DAG.",
        "8 An example like this may seem arcane, but cases of multiple points of view, or multiple threading, are found in a variety of textual models.",
        "Thus, in a murder mystery, the detective comes to understand the ordering of particular events, including the murder, and may subsequently explain 6 This instance of prolepsis is discussed in Grethlein (2010).",

        "We may represent the interplay between what is given by the text and the information available to the reader (which, importantly, is also representable by a DAG) as shown in Fig. 5, where we see that the node exist(troops...), represented in the text, depends on the node command(hamilcar...) also represented in the text.",
