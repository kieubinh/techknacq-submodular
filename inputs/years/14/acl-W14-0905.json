        "In recent years, the interest for quantitative methods of literary analysis has grown significantly.",
        "Humanities scholars and researchers are increasingly aware of the potential of data-driven approaches in a field that has traditionally been studied from a ?close reading?",
        "perspective.",
        "Large repositories of literary text together with the development of promising techniques from fields such as text mining or information extraction offer advantages that open new possibilities to the field of literature studies.",
        "So far, most quantitative studies of literature have focused mainly on form and content.",
        "Structure and plot, considered key dimensions in a novel, have often been ignored due to the complexity in quantifying them.",
        "In this study, we explore the contribution of features that are directly related to them.",
        "With this goal, we represent a novel as a social network of characters (a technique that is not novel in the field of quantitative literary analysis), from which to extract features that can be used to perform document clustering.",
        "The outcome of the clustering will be a grouping of novels according to their structural similarity.",
        "This is an exploratory study to determine to what degree the structure and plot of a novel are representative of the genre to which it belongs and characteristic of the style of its author.",
        "Two hypotheses are made on the basis of this premise.",
        "The first is that the structure and plot of the novel represented as a static and dynamic social network is key to predict the literary genre to which a novel belongs.",
        "The second is that the inner structure of the society depicted by the author in a novel is representative of this author.",
        "This approach introduces the use of automatically extracted static and dynamic networks to perform large-scale analyses of novels, by representing them as vectors of features that can then be used to compare the novels in terms of genre and authorship.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we present the related work.",
        "Section 3 describes the method employed in turning a novel into the vector of features chosen to characterize it.",
        "The experiments conducted are discussed in Section 4 and the results and analysis of them in Section 5.",
        "We discuss the results in Section 6 and conclude in Section 7.",
        "2 Related Work 2.1 Unsupervised Document Classification Unsupervised document classification (or ?docu- ment clustering?)",
        "consists in automatically grouping a set of documents based on the similarities among them.",
        "Unlike its supervised counterpart, it does not require neither labeled training data nor prior knowledge of the classes into which the texts are to be categorized.",
        "Instead, documents?",
        "represented as vectors of features?that are similar are grouped together, yielding a clustering that is dependent on the features chosen to characterize the document.",
        "Due to the lack of supervision, it is not guaranteed that the resulting clustering corresponds to the classes in which we are interested (Zhang, 2013).",
        "Unsupervised authorship analysis from docu-31 ments is the task of automatically grouping texts that share the same author, by determining the set of features that distinguish one author from any other.",
        "The first approaches focused mainly on sty-lometrics (Ledger and Merriam (1994), Holmes and Forsyth (1995), Baayen et al. (1996), and Aaronson (2001)).",

        "The lexicon of the author is in this work represented as semantic fields (the au-thor's idiolect) on which Singular Value Decomposition is applied.",
        "Much less effort has been devoted to the task of clustering documents by the genre in which they fall.",
        "Examples of this are Gupta et al. (2005), Poudat and Cleuziou (2003), and Bekkerman et al. (2007).",
        "The work of Allison et al. (2011) uses stylometric features to cluster 36 novels according to genre.",

        "However, a novel should not be reduced to the dimensions of punctuation, morphology, syntax and semantics.",
        "This literary form has a depth, a complex structure of plot, characters and narration.",
        "The plot of a novel is defined in the Russian structuralism school by the collection of its characters and the actions they carry out (Bakhtin (1941), Propp (1968)).",

        "1 Moretti (2011), concerned about how plot can be quantified, explores extensively the impact characters have on it.",
        "To this end, Moretti represents the characters of William Shakespeare's Hamlet as a social network.",
        "Several experiments (removing the protagonist, iso-lates, or a connecting character from the network) show how the plot changes accordingly to the alteration in the structure of characters.",
        "Sack (2012) 1 This is particularly evident in William M. Thackeray's novel Vanity Fair through the ironic and mocking voice of the narrator, making the reader aware of his describing much more than just the adventures and missfortunes of a collection of invented characters.",
        "proposes using social networks of characters as a mechanism for generating plots artificially.",
        "One of the first attempts of combining social networks and literature was in Alberich et al. (2002).",
        "They built a social network from the Marvel comics in which characters are the nodes, linked by their co-occurrence in the same book.",
        "The authors note that the resulting network was very similar to a real social network.",
        "In Newman and Girvan (2003), the authors used a hand-built social network with the main characters of Victor Hugo's Les Mis?erables to detect communities of characters that were densely connected.",
        "These communities, in the words of the authors, ?clearly reflect[ed] the subplot structure of the book?.",
        "Elson et al. (2010) introduced an interesting idea: so far, two characters had always been linked by an edge if they occurred in the same text-window.",
        "In their approach, characters are linked if they converse.",

        "The actors in a novel are its characters, and thus extracting person names from the raw text is necessarily the first step 32 to construct a social network from a novel.",

        "With the assumption that a novel is a small universe in which one proper name is likely to refer to the same entity throughout the novel, we eliminate these inconsistencies by re-tagging the file, so that each entity recognized during the filtering is tagged as person throughout the file.",
        "Each proper name that has been tagged as a person more times than as a location is also re-tagged consistently as person.",

        "A conversational network is well-suited to represent plays, where social interaction is almost only represented by means of dialogue.",
        "However, much of the interaction in novels is done off-dialogue through the description of the narrator or indirect interactions.",
        "Thus, using a conversational network might not suffice to capture all interactions, and it would definitely have severe limitations in novels with unmarked dialogue, little dialogue or none.",
        "11 The networks built in this approach are static and dynamic co-occurrence networks.",
        "12 A static network allows better visualization of the novel as a whole, and the features extracted from it correspond to a time agnostic analysis of the novel's plot.",

        "The graph is undirected (the direction of the interaction is ignored) and weighted (the weight is the number of interactions between the two linked nodes).",
        "In 1 st person novels, the off-dialogue occurrences of pronoun ?I?",

        "The author experiment has a total of 27 features, while the genre experiment has 55 22 .",
        "The baseline we propose is based on content: for each novel a vector with a raw Bag-of-words representation is generated.",

        "The task of evaluating the results of a clustering is not trivial, since one cannot know with certainty which labels correspond to which clusters.",
        "In this approach, the labelling of the classes relies on Weka's 23 (Hall et al., 2009) Classes to clusters evaluation function-ality, which assigns a label to the cluster which contains most of the elements of the labeled class, as long as the class is not defining another cluster.",
        "The evaluation is based on three popular metrics: purity, entropy and F 1 measure.",
        "In the clustering experiments by genre, if one novel is classified as at least one of the correct classes, we consider it to be correct.",

        "The reason why the 19Corpus performs significantly better than the rest of the collections is probably to be found in the fact that all other collections contain documents from very different ages (up to five centuries of difference) and countries of origin.",
        "Since novels usually depict the society of the moment, it is not surprising that the more local the collection of texts, the higher the performance of the approach is.",

        "It is the case, for example, of the categories Bildungsroman and picaresque.",
        "Some novels that should have been labeled Bildungsroman are instead considered picaresque, or vice versa.",
        "Indeed, one can easily find certain characteristics that are shared in both genres, such as a strong protagonist and a whole constellation of minor characters around him or her.",
        "What distinguishes them from being the same genre is that the focus and goal in a Bildungsroman is on the development of the main character.",
        "Picaresque novels, on the contrary, usually have no designed goal for the protagonist, and consist of a sequence of adventures, most of them unrelated and inconsequential to each other.",
        "The same kind of strong relationship exists, in a lesser extent, between historical, social and satirical genres.",
        "These three genres are somewhat intertwined.",
        "Social criticism might be carried out through a satirical novel, which might be set to take place in the past, making it a historical novel.",
        "Our method classifies these three genres indistinctly together, and this might well be because of their very similar structural characteristics.",
        "We consider this experiment a first step in the task of novel clustering by genre.",
        "The method that 37 we have presented is far from being perfected.",
        "We have used all the features that we have designed in an unweighted way and without optimizing them.",
        "However, it is assumed that some features will have a bigger impact than others at determining genres.",
        "A blunt analysis of the role of the features informs that the relevance of the protagonist node is key, for example, to identify genres such as Bildungsroman and picaresque.",
        "A high proportion of minor or isolate nodes is, for example, a very good indicator of satirical, social, and historical genres.",
        "An unknown narrator is a good indicator that we are in front of a science fiction novel, while a mixed point of view is usually kept for either science fiction, gothic, or mystery novels.",
        "6.2 Clustering by Author The clustering by author is much clearer than the clustering by genre, and very interesting patterns can be found when looked in detail.",
        "One can learn, for instance, that the structure of Jane Austen novels are in the antipodes of the structure of William M. Thackeray's works (as could be inferred from Figures 1 and 2).",
        "These two authors are, alongside Rowling, the easiest authors to identify.",
        "In fact, a clustering of only the novels by these three authors result in a perfectly clear-cut grouping with no misclassifications.",
        "Dickens and Eliot are on the other hand the most difficult authors to identify, partly because their structures are more varied.",
        "An in-depth study of the role of each feature in the clustering provides a very interesting view of the literary work of each author.",
        "We can see in our sample that female writers (in particular Austen and Gaskell) have a much higher proportion of female characters than male writers (in particular Dickens, Turgenev, and Dostoyevsky), with Thackeray and Rowling depicting a more equal society.",
        "Examples of behaviors that can be read from the clustering are many.",
        "The very low graph density of Thackeray's novels contrasts with the high density of the novels by Austen and Tur-genev, whereas all of Gaskell's novels have a strikingly similar graph density.",
        "In the case of the Harry Potter books, the first ones are significantly denser than the last ones.",
        "The role of the protagonist also varies depending on the author.",
        "It is very important in the works by Austen, Gaskell, and Rowling, in which the presence of the protagonist is constant throughout the novel.",
        "Turgenev's protagonists are also very strong, even though their presence varies along the chapters.",
        "Thackeray, on the other hand, is by far the author that gives more weight to minor characters and isolates.",
        "Turgenev has a high proportion of isolate nodes, while they are almost null in works by Rowling and Austen.",
        "The dynamic features show the different distributions of characters over the time of the novel.",
        "They allow us see very clearly in which stages coincide the maximum number of characters (the falling action in the case of Austen, the d?enouement in the case of Eliot, the rising action in the case of Rowling).",
        "They allow us to see also how a very high proportion of characters in Thackeray's novels appear in only one stage in the novel, to then disappear.",
        "In the other side of the spectrum are Austen and Dostoyevsky, whose characters arrive in the novel to stay.",
        "These are only some of the most evident conclusions that can be drawn from the author-clustering experiment.",
        "A more in-depth analysis could be useful, for example, to identify changes in the work of one same author.",
        "7 Conclusion This work is a contribution to the field of quantitative literary analysis.",
        "We have presented a method to build static and dynamic social networks from novels as a way of representing structure and plot.",
        "Our goal was two-fold: to learn which role the structure of a novel plays in identifying a novelistic genre, and to understand to what extent the structure of the novel is a fingerprint of the style of the author.",
        "We have designed two experiments shaped as unsupervised document classification tasks.",
        "The first experiment, clustering by genre resulted in a negative clustering but, if analyzed qualitatively, shows that the approach is promis-ing, even if it must be polished.",
        "The second ex-periment, clustering by author, outperformed the baseline and obtained good enough positive results.",
        "Authorship attribution is mostly used for either forensic purposes or plagiarism identification.",
        "However, we have shown that an analysis of the features and yielded clustering can also be used to explore structural inter- and intra-similarities among different authors.",
