        "Comparable corpora have recently attracted huge interest in natural language processing research.",
        "Comparable corpora are now considered as a rich resource for acquiring parallel resources such as parallel corpus or parallel text fragments,.",
        "Parallel text extracted from comparable corpora can take an important role in improving the quality of machine translation (MT) (Smith et al. 2010).",
        "Parallel text extracted from comparable corpora are typically added with the training corpus as additional training material which is expected to facilitate better performance of SMT systems specifically for low density language pairs.",
        "In the present work, we try to extract English?Bengali parallel fragments of text from comparable corpora.",
        "We have collected document aligned corpus of English?Bengali document pairs from Wikipedia which provides a huge collection of documents in many different languages.",
        "For automatic alignment of parallel fragments we have used two-way textual entailment (TE) system and a baseline SMT system.",
        "Textual entailment (TE), introduced by (Dagan and Glickman, 2004), is defined as a directional relationship between pairs of text expressions, denoted by the entailing text (T) and the entailed hypothesis (H).",
        "T entails H if the meaning of H can be inferred from the meaning of T. Textual Entailment has many applications in NLP tasks, such as summarization, information extraction, question answering, 48 information retrieval, machine translation, etc.",
        "In machine translation, textual entailment can be applied to MT evaluation (Padó et al., 2009).",
        "A number of research works have been carried out on cross-lingual Textual entailment using MT (Mehdad et al.,2010; Negri et al., 2010; Neogi et al., 2012).",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge, the work presented here is the first attempt towards employing textual entailment for the purpose of extracting parallel text fragments from comparable corpora which in turn are used to improve MT system.",
        "Munteanu and Marcu (2006) suggested that comparable corpora tend to have parallel data at sub-sentential level.",
        "Hence, instead of finding sentence level parallel resource from comparable corpora, in the present work we mainly focus on finding parallel fragments of text.",
        "We carried out the task of automatic alignment of parallel fragments using three steps: (i) mining comparable corpora form Wikipedia, (ii) sentence level alignment using two-way TE and a baseline Bengali?English SMT system, and finally (iii) clustering the parallel sentence aligned comparable corpora using textual entailment and then aligning parallel fragments of text by textual entailment and a baseline Bengali?English SMT system.",
        "Although, we have collected document aligned comparable corpora, the documents in the corpus do not belong to any particular domain.",
        "Even with such a corpus we have been able to improve the performance of an existing machine translation system which was built on tourism domain data.",
        "This also signifies the contribution of this work towards domain adaptation of MT systems.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the related work.",
        "Section 3 describes the mining process of the comparable corpora.",
        "The two-way TE system architecture is described in section 4.",
        "Section 5 describes the automatic alignment technique of parallel fragment of texts.",
        "Section 6 describes the tools and resources used for this work.",
        "The experiments and evaluation results are presented in section 7.",
        "Section 8 concludes and presents avenues for future work.",
        "2 Related Work Comparable corpora have been used in many research areas in NLP, especially in machine translation.",
        "Several earlier works have studied the use of comparable corpora in machine translation.",
        "However, most of these approaches (Fung and McKeown, 1997; Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002; Dejean et al., 2002; Kaji, 2005; Otero, 2007; Saralegui et al., 2008; Gupta et al., 2013) are specifically focused on extracting word translations from comparable corpora.",
        "Most of the strategies follow a standard method based on the context vector similarity measure such as finding the target words that have the most similar distributions with a given source word.",
        "In most of the cases, a starting list contains the ?seed expressions?",
        "and this list is required to build the context vectors of the words in both the languages.",
        "A bilingual dictionary can be used as a starting list.",
        "The bilingual list can also be prepared form parallel corpus using bilingual correlation method (Otero, 2007).",
        "Instead of a bilingual list, multilingual thesaurus could also be used for this purpose (Dejean, 2002).",
        "Wikipedia is a multilingual encyclopedia available in different languages and it can be used as a source of comparable corpora.",
        "Otero et al. (2010) stored the entire Wikipedia for any two languages and transformed it into a new collection: CorpusPedia.",
        "Our work shows that only a small ad-hoc corpus containing Wikipedia articles could prove to be beneficial for existing MT systems.",
        "In the NIST shared task on Recognizing Textual Entailment Challenge (RTE), several methods have been proposed to tackle the textual entailment problem.",
        "Most of these systems use some form of lexical matching, e.g., n-gram, word similarity, etc.",
        "and even simple word overlap.",
        "A number of systems represent the texts as parse trees (e.g., syntactic or dependency trees) 49 before the actual task.",
        "Some of the systems use semantic features (e.g., logical inference, Semantic Role Labelling) for solving the text and hypothesis entailment problem.",
        "MacCartney et al. (2006) proposed a new architecture for textual inference in which finding a good alignment is separated from evaluating entailment.",
        "Agichtein et al. (2008) presented a supervised machine learning approach to train a classifier over a variety of lexical, syntactic, and semantic metrics.",
        "Malakasiotis (2009) used string similarity measures applied to shallow abstractions of the input sentences and a Maximum Entropy classifier to learn how to combine the resulting features.",
        "In the present work, we used the textual entailment system of Pakray et al. (2011) which performed well on various RTE tasks and datasets, as well as other NLP tasks like question answering, summarization, etc.",
        "We integrated a new module to by using reVerb 1 tool and optimized all the features produced by different modules.",
        "The main objective of the present work is to investigate whether textual entailment can be used to establish alignments between text fragments in comparable corpora and whether the parallel text fragments extracted thus can improve MT system performance.",
        "3 Mining Comparable Corpora We collected comparable corpora from Wikipedia online collaborative encyclopedia available in a wide variety of languages.",
        "English Wikipedia contains largest volume of data such as millions of articles; there are many language editions with at least 100,000 articles.",
        "Wikipedia links articles on the same topic in different languages using ?interwiki?",
        "linking facility.",
        "Wikipedia is an enormously useful re-source for extracting parallel resources as the documents in different languages are already aligned.",
        "We first collect an English document from Wikipedia and then find the same document in Bengali if there 1 http://reverb.cs.washington.edu/ exists any inter-language link.",
        "Extracted English?Bengali document pairs from Wikipedia are already comparable since they are written about the same entity.",
        "Although each English?Bengali document pairs are comparable and they discuss about the same topic, most of the times they are not exact translation of each other; as a result parallel fragments of text are rarely found in these document pairs.",
        "The bigger the size of the fragment may result less probable parallel version will be found in the target side.",
        "Nevertheless, there is always chance of getting parallel phrase, tokens or even sentences in comparable documents.",
        "We designed a crawler to collect comparable corpora for English?Bengali document pairs.",
        "Based on an initial seed keyword list, the crawler first visits each English page of Wikipedia, saves the raw text (in HTML format), and then follows the cross-lingual link for each English page and collects the corresponding Bengali document.",
        "In this way, we collect English?Bengali comparable documents in the tourism domain.",
        "We retain only the textual information and all the other details are discarded.",
        "We extract English and Bengali sentences from each document.",
        "The extracted sentences from each English document are not parallel with the corresponding Bengali document.",
        "Moreover, Bengali documents are contained limited information compare to the English document.",
        "We align sentences of English?Bengali from these comparable corpora through a baseline PB-SMT system.",
        "A Bengali-English baseline PB-SMT system has been developed which was trained on English?Bengali tourism domain corpus.",
        "We translated Bengali sentences into English.",
        "The translated sentence is then examined for entailment in the English comparable document by using two-way TE system proposed in section 4.",
        "If it is more than 50% entailed with the target document then the target sentence is directly fetched form the comparable English document and the source-target sentence pair are saved in a list.",
        "In this way, we extract parallel sentences from comparable corpora.",
        "These parallel sentences except those are 100% entailed may 50 not be completely parallel but they are comparable.",
        "So, we created a parallel fragment list which is proposed in section 5.",
        "4 Two-way Textual Entailment System A two-way automatic textual entailment (TE) recognition system that uses lexical, syntactic and semantic features has been described in this section.",
        "The system architecture has been shown in Figure 1.",
        "The TE system has used the Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique that uses thirty-one features for training purpose.",
        "In lexical module there are eighteen features and eleven features from syntactic module, one feature by using reVerb and one feature from semantic module.",
        "Fig.1 Two way TE architecture 4.1 Lexical Module In this module six lexical comparisons and seventeen lexical distance comparisons between text and hypothesis has used.",
        "Six lexical comparisons are WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) based unigram match, bigram match, longest common sub-sequence, skip-gram, stemming and named entity matching.",
        "We have calculated weight from each of these six comparisons in equation (1).",
        "weight = number of common tokens between text and - hypothesis?",
        "number of tokens in - hypothesis?",
        "(1) The API for WordNet Searching (JAWS) 2 provides Java applications with the ability to retrieve data from the WordNet 2.1 database.",
        "For Named entity detection we have used Text Tokenization Toolkit (LT-TTT2)3 (Grover et.",
        "al., 1999).",
        "The LT-TTT2 named entity component has been used.",
        "For lexical distance measure, we have used features of Vector Space Measures (Euclidean distance, Block distance, Minkowsky distance, Cosine similarity, Matching Coefficient), Set-based Similarities (Dice, Jaccard, Overlap, Harmonic), Edit Distance Measures (Levenshtein distance, Smith-Waterman distance, Jaro Distance).",
        "Lexical distance measurement has used the libraries SimMetrics 4 , SimPack 5 and SecondString6.",
        "SimMetrics is a Similarity Metric Library, e.g., from edit distance (Levenshtein, Gotoh, Jaro etc) to other metrics, (e.g Soundex, Chapman).",

        "The system extracts syntactic structures from the text-hypothesis pairs using Combinatory Categorial Grammar (C&C CCG) Parser 7 and Stanford Parser 8 and compares the corresponding structures to determine if the entailment relation is established.",
        "Two different systems have been implemented one system used Stanford Parser output and another system used C&C CCG Parser.",
        "The system accepts pairs of text snippets (text and hypothesis) at the input and gives score for each comparison.",

        "The process of representing natural language sentences in UNL graphs is called En-converting and the process of generating natural language sentences out of UNL graphs is called De-converting.",
        "An En-Converter is a language independent parser, which provides a framework for morphological, syntactic, and semantic analysis synchronously.",
        "The En-Converter is based on a word dictionary and a set of enconversion grammar rules.",

        "We intersect between the both English and Bengali sentences which are belonging to the same clusters.",
        "We try to align the English and Bengali fragments extracted from a parallel sentence aligned comparable resource list.",
        "If both sides contain only one fragment then the alignment is trivial, and we add such fragment pairs to seed another parallel fragment corpus that contains examples having only one token in both side.",
        "Otherwise, we establish alignments between the English and Bengali fragments using translation.",
        "If both the English and Bengali side contains n number of fragments, and the alignments of n-1 fragments can be established through translation 11 http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/ or by means of already existing alignments, then the nth alignment is trivial.",

        "Experiments were carried out with different n-gram settings for the language model and the maximum phrase length and it was found that a 4-gram language model and a maximum phrase length of 7 produce the optimum baseline result on both the development and the test set.",
        "We carried out the rest of the experiments using these settings.",
        "The collected comparable corpus consisted of 5582 English?Bengali document pairs.",

        "When the Bengali fragments of texts were passed to the Bengali?English translation module some of them could not be translated into English and also, some of them could be translated only partially.",
        "Therefore, some of the tokens were translated while some were not.",
        "Some of those partially translated text fragments were aligned through textual entailment; however, most of them were discarded.",
        "As can be seen from Table 4, 9,117 sentences were entailed in the English side, of which the system was able to establish cross-lingual entailment for 2,361 English?Bengali sentence pairs.",

        "Finally, the textual entailment based alignment procedure was able to align 3937 parallel fragments as reported in Table 4.",
        "Manual inspection of the parallel list revealed that most of the aligned texts were of good quality.",
        "We carried out evaluation of the MT quality using four automatic MT evaluation metrics: BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), NIST (Doddington, 2002) and TER (Snover et al., 2006).",
        "Table 5 shows the performance of the PB-SMT systems built on the initial training corpus and the larger training corpus containing parallel text fragments extracted from the comparable corpora.",
        "Treating the parallel text fragments extracted from the comparable corpora as additional training material results in significant improvement in terms of BLEU (1.73 points, 15.84% relative) over the baseline system.",
        "Similar improvements are also obtained for the other metrics.",
        "The low evaluation scores could be attributed to the fact that Bengali is a morphologically rich language and has a relatively free phrase order; besides there were only one set of reference translations for the testset.",

        "The parallel text fragments extracted thus were able to bring significant improvements in the performance of an existing machine translation system.",
        "For low density language pairs, this approach can help to improve the state-of-art machine translation quality.",
        "A manual inspection on a subset of the output revealed that the additional training material 54 extracted from comparable corpora effectively resulted in better lexical choice and less OOV words than the baseline output.",
        "As the collected parallel text does not belong to any particular domain, this work also signifies that out of domain data is also useful to enhance the performance of a domain specific MT system.",
