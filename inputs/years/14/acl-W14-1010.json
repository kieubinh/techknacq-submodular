        "The automatic acquisition of translation equivalents from parallel texts has been extensively studied since the 1990s.",
        "At the beginning, the acquired bilingual lexicons had much poorer quality as compared to the human-built translation dictionaries.",
        "The limited size of available parallel corpora often resulted in small coverage and the imperfections of alignment methods introduced a considerable amount of noisy translations.",
        "However, the automatimacally acquired lexicons served as internal resources for statistical machine translation (SMT) (Brown et al., 1993), information retrieval (IR) (McEvan et al., 2002; Velupillai, 2008), or computer-assisted lexicography (Atkins, 1994; Hartmann, 1994).",
        "The current progress in search of web-based parallel documents (Resnik, 2003; Smith, 2013) makes it possible to automatically construct large-scale bilingual lexicons.",
        "These lexicons can already compare in coverage to the traditional translation dictionaries.",
        "Hence a new interesting possibility arises to produce automatically acquired human-oriented translation dictionaries, that have a practical application.",
        "A machine translation system can output an automatically generated dictionary entry in response to the short queries.",
        "The percentage of short queries can be quite large, and the system benefits from showing several possible translations instead of a single result of machine translation (Figure 1).",
        "Figure 1: Examples of dictionary entries in two online statistical machine translation systems.",
        "The initial translation equivalents for a bilingual lexicon can be extracted with the help of the techniques and tools developed for the phrase-table construction in SMT.",
        "The widely used word alignment and phrase extraction algorithms are described in Brown et.al (1993) and Och (2004).",
        "Though an SMT phrase-table actually consists of translation equivalents, it may differ substantially from a traditional dictionary (Table 1).",
        "58 Human-oriented dictionary SMT phrase-table Lemmatized entries are preferred.",
        "Words and phrases in all forms are acceptable.",
        "Only linguistically motivated phrases are acceptable.",
        "Any multiword phrase is acceptable.",
        "Precision is important.",
        "Any noise is undesirable.",
        "Having lots of low-probability noise is acceptable, since it is generally overridden by better translations.",
        "Table 1: Differences between a human-oriented dictionary and an SMT phrase-table.",
        "While the problems of lemmatization and selection of linguistically motivated phrases can be addressed by applying appropriate morphological and syntactic tools, the problem of noise reduction is essential for the dictionary quality.",
        "The current progress in the automatic acquisition of similar Web documents in different languages (Resnik, 2003; Smith, 2013) allows to collect large-scale corpora.",
        "But the automatically found documents can be non-parallel, or contain spam, machine translation, language recognition mistakes, badly parsed HTML-markup.",
        "The noisy parallel sentences can be the source of lots of noisy translations ?",
        "unrelated, misspelled, or belonging to a different language.",
        "For example, non-parallel sentences The apartment is at a height of 36 floors!",
        "(English) La plage est `a 1 minute en voiture.",
        "(French: The beach is 1 minute by car.)",
        "may produce a wrong translation ?apartment - plage?.",
        "Or, automatically translated sentences The figures in the foreground and background play off each other well.",
        "(En- glish) Les chiffres du premier plan et jouer hors de l?autre bien.",
        "(French: The digits of the foreground and play out of the other well.)",
        "may produce a wrong phrase translation ?figures in the foreground chiffres du premier plan?.",
        "An intuitive approach would be to apply noise filtering to the corpus, not to the lexicon.",
        "One could discard those sentences that deviate too much from the expected behavior.",
        "For example, sentences that have many unknown words and few symmetrically aligned words are unlikely to be really parallel.",
        "However, natural language demonstrates a great variability.",
        "A single sentence pair can deviate strongly from the expected behavior, and still contain some good translations.",
        "On the other hand, many noisy translations can still penetrate the lexicon, and further noise detection is necessary.",
        "In a bilingual lexicon we want not just to lower the probabilities of noisy translations, but to remove them completely.",
        "This can be regarded as a binary classification task ?",
        "the phrase pairs are to be classified into good and noisy ones.",
        "Different types of information can be combined in a feature vector.",
        "We take advantage of the phrase-level features, such as co-occurrence counts or translation probabilities, and also propose a number of sentence-level context features.",
        "To calculate the sentence-level features for a given phrase-pair, we average the characteristics of all the sentences where it occurs.",
        "We test the proposed algorithm experimentally, by constructing the bilingual lexicons for nine language pairs.",
        "The manually annotated samples of phrase pairs serve as the data for training supervised classifiers.",
        "The experiment shows that the use of the sentence-level features increases the classification accuracy, compared to a baseline which uses only phrase frequencies and translation probabilities.",
        "We compare the accuracy of different classifiers and evaluate the importance of different features.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we outline the related work.",
        "Section 3 describes our approach to the noise reduction in a bilingual lexicon and discusses the proposed features.",
        "We describe our experiments on training classifiers in Section 4.",
        "Section 5 concludes the paper.",
        "2 Previous work The methods of extracting a bilingual lexicon from parallel texts as a part of the alignment process are discussed in Brown (1993), Melamed (1996), Tufis?",
        "and Barbu (2001).",
        "Melamed (1996) proposes a method of noise reduction that allows 59 to re-estimate and filter out indirect word associations.",
        "However, he works with a carefully prepared Hansards parallel corpus and the noise comes only from the imperfections of statistical modeling.",
        "Sahlgren (2004) proposes a co-occurrence-based approach, representing words as high-dimensional random index vectors.",
        "The vectors of translation equivalents are expected to have high correlation.",
        "Yet, he notes that low-frequency words do not produce reliable statistics for this method.",
        "The methods of bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable texts (Rapp, 1995; Fung, 1998; Otero, 2007) also deal with the problem of noise reduction.",
        "However, the precision/recall ratio of a lexicon extracted from comparable corpus is generally lower.",
        "For the purpose of building a human-oriented dictionary, the parallel texts may provide the larger coverage and better quality of the translation equivalents.",
        "The noise reduction task is addressed by some of the SMT phrase-table pruning techniques.",
        "The most straightforward approach is thresholding on the translation probability (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "Moore (2004) proposes the log-likelihood ratio and Fisher's exact test to re-estimate word association strength.",
        "Johnson et al. (2007) applies Fisher's exact test to dramatically reduce the number of phrase pairs in the phrase-table.",
        "They get rid of phrases that appear as alignment artifacts or are unlikely to occur again.",
        "The implementation of their algorithm requires a special index of all parallel corpus in order to enable a quick look-up for a given phrase pair.",
        "Eck et al. (2007) assesses the phrase pairs based on the actual usage statistics when translating a large amount of text.",
        "Entropy-based criteria are proposed in Ling et al. (2012), Zens et al. (2012).",
        "Automatically acquired bilingual lexicons are capable to reflect many word meanings and translation patterns, which are often not obvious even to the professional lexicographers (Sharoff, 2004).",
        "Their content can also be updated regularly to incorporate more parallel texts and capture the translations of new words and expressions.",
        "Thus, the methods allowing to improve the quality of automatic bilingual lexicons are of practical importance.",
        "3 Noise detection features We treat the noise recognition task as a binary classification problem.",
        "A set of nonlexical context features is designed to be sensitive to different types of noise in the parallel corpus.",
        "We expect that the combination of these features with the phrase-level features based on co-occurrence statistics can improve the accuracy of the classification and the overall quality of a bilingual lexicon.",
        "3.1 Context feature extraction algorithm The procedure of getting the context features is outlined in Algorithm 1.",
        "Unlike Johnson et al. (2007) we do not rely on any pre-constructed index of the parallel sentences, because it requires a lot of RAM on large corpora.",
        "Instead we rerun the phrase extraction algorithm of the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007) and update the context features at the moment when a phrase pair t is found.",
        "Algorithm 1 Calculate context features for all lexicon entries Require: Parallel corpus ?",
        "C; {word-aligned sentences} Require: Bilingual lexicon ?",
        "D; {this is a phrase-table, derived from C and modified as descibed in 4.1} Ensure: V = {v?",

        "(d)/(1 + n(d)); {average, +1 smoothing} return V 3.2 Sentence-level features The phrase extraction algorithms do not preserve the information about the sentences in which a given phrase pair occurred, assuming that all the sentences are equally good.",
        "As a result, the 60 phrase-level statistics is insufficient in case of a noisy corpus.",
        "The sentence-level features are designed to partly restore the information which is lost during the phrase extraction process.",
        "We try to estimate the general characteristics of the whole set of parallel sentences where a given phrase pair occurred.",
        "The proposed sentence-level features rely on the different sources of information, which are discussed in 3.2.1, 3.2.2 and 3.2.3.",
        "Table 2 provides illustrating examples of noisy phrase pairs and sample sentences.",
        "3.2.1 Word-alignment annotation We use the intersection of direct and reverse Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2004) alignments as a heuristic rule to find words reliably aligned to each other.",
        "The alignment information gives rise to several sentence-level features: ?",

        "UnsafeJump average distance between the translations of subsequent input words.",
        "?",
        "UnsafeDigAlign percentage of unequal digits among the symmetrically aligned words.",
        "The UnsafeAlign and UnsafeJump values can vary in different sentences.",
        "However, their being too large on the whole set of sentences where a given phrase pair occurred possibly indicates some systematic noise.",
        "The translations of digits are not included to the dictionary by themselves.",
        "But if a pair of digits is wrongly aligned, then its nearest context may also be aligned wrongly.",
