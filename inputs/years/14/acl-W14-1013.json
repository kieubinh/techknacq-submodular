        "It is well known that source-context information plays a significant role in human-based language translation (Padilla and Bajo, 1998).",
        "A similar claim can be supported for the case of Machine Translation on the grounds of the Distributional Hypothesis (Firth, 1957).",
        "According to the Distributional Hypothesis, much of the meaning of a given word is implied by its context rather than by the word itself.",
        "In this work, we first focus our attention on the fact that the classical formulation of the statistical machine translation framework, implicitly disregards the role of source-context information within the translation generation process.",
        "Based on this, we propose a principled reformulation that allows for introducing context-awareness into the statistical machine translation framework.",
        "Then, a specific computational implementation for the newly proposed model is derived and described, along with its main properties and limitations.",
        "The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "First, in section 2, the theoretical background and motivation for this work are presented.",
        "Then, in section 3, the proposed model derivation is described.",
        "In section 4, a specific computational implementation for the model is provided.",
        "And, finally in section 5, main conclusions and future research work are presented.",
        "2 Theoretical Background According to the original formulation of the translation problem within the statistical frame-work, the decoding process is implemented by means of a probability maximization mechanism: ??",

        "is provided by the hypothesis ?",
        "that maximizes the conditional probability of ?",
        "given ?.",

        "is referred to as the language model.",
        "Notice from the resulting formulation in (2) that, as the maximization runs over the translation hypothesis space {?",

        "This particular consequence of the mathematical representation in (2) is counterintuitive to the notion of source-context information being useful for selecting appropriate translations.",
        "This problem becomes more relevant when the probability models in (2) are decomposed into sub-sentence level probabilities for operational purposes.",

        "In addition, the maximum entropy framework also allows for tuning the weights in the log-linear combinations of models by means of discriminative training.",

        "While this information might be not too relevant when estimating probabilities at the sentence level, it certainly becomes a very useful evidence support at the sub-sentence level.",

        "can be either a paragraph or a full document; if ?",
        "is a sub-sentence unit, ?",
        "can be a sentence; and so on.",
        "From the theoretical point of view, the formulation in (6) is supported by the assumptions of the Distributional Hypothesis, which states that meaning is mainly derived from context rather than from individual language units.",
        "According to this, the formulation in (6) allows for incorporating context information into the translation generation process, in a similar way humans take source-context information into account when producing a translation.",

        "Accordingly, and in order to be relevant, the span of the context information to be used must be larger than the one implicitly accounted for by the phrases.",
        "Typically, phrases span vary from one to several words, but most of the time they remain within the sub-sentence level.",
        "Then, a context definition at the sentence-level should be appropriate for the purpose of estimating context-awareness probabilities at the phrase-level.",
        "In this way, we can consider the context evidence ?",

        "Second, different from the lexical models and relative frequencies that can be computed on both directions (source-to-target and target-to-source), a symmetric version of the context-awareness model cannot be implemented for decoding.",
        "This is basically because estimating probabilities of the form ?(?|?",
        "?, ??)",

        "The proposed approach reformulates the posterior probability of a translation hypothesis given the source input by incorporating the source-context information as and additional conditioning variable.",
        "As a result, a new probability model component, the context-awareness model, has been introduced into the noisy channel approach formulation.",
        "We also presented a specific computational implementation of the context-awareness model, in which likelihoods are estimated for the context evidence at the phrase-level based on the use of fractional counts, which can be computed by means of a similarity metric.",
