        "The task of identifying word translations from comparable text has received considerable attention.",
        "Some early papers include Fung (1995) and Rapp (1995).",
        "Fung (1995) utilized a context heterogeneity measure, thereby assuming that words with productive context in one language translate to words with productive context in another lan-guage, and words with rigid context translate into words with rigid context.",
        "In contrast, the underlying assumption in Rapp (1995) was that words which are translations of each other show similar co-occurrence patterns across languages.",
        "This assumption is effectively an extension of Harris' (1954) distributional hypotheses to the multilingual case.",
        "This work was further elaborated in some by now classical papers, such as Fung & Yee (1998) and Rapp (1999).",
        "Based on these papers, the standard approach is to start from a dictionary of seed words, and to assume that the words occurring in the context of a source language word have similar meanings as the words occurring in the context of its target language translation.",
        "There have been suggestions to eliminate the need for the seed dictionary.",
        "However, most at-tempts, such as Rapp (1995), Diab & Finch (2000) and Haghighi et al. (2008) did not work to an extent that the results would be useful for practical purposes.",
        "Only recently a more promising approach has been investigated: Schafer & Yarowsky (2002), Hassan & Mihalcea (2009), Prochasson & Fung (2011) and Rapp et al. (2012) look at aligned comparable documents and deal with them in analogy to the treatment of aligned parallel sentences, i.e. effectively doing a word alignment in a very noisy environment.",
        "This approach has been rather successful and it was possible to improve on previous results.",
        "This is therefore the approach which we will pursue in the current paper.",
        "However, in contrast to the above mentioned papers the focus of our work is on multiword expressions, and we will compare the performance of our algorithm when applied to multiword expressions and when applied to single words.",
        "There has been some previous work on identifying the translations of multiword units using comparable corpora, such as Robitaille et al. (2006), Babych et al. (2007), Daille & Morin (2012); Delpech et al. (2012).",
        "However, none of this work utilizes aligned comparable documents, and the underlying assumption is that the translation of a multiword unit can be determined by looking at its components individually, and by merging the results.",
        "In contrast, we try to explore whether the translation of a multiword unit can be determined solely by looking at its contextual behavior, i.e. whether it is possible to also apply the standard approach as successfully used for single words.",
        "The underlying fundamental question is whether the meaning of a multiword unit is determined by 87 the contextual behavior of the full unit, or by the contextual behavior of its components (or by a mix of both).",
        "But multiword expressions are of complex nature, as expressed e.g. by Moon (1998): \"there is no unified phenomenon to describe but rather a complex of features that interact in various, often untidy, ways and represent a broad continuum between non-compositional (or idiomatic) and compositional groups of words.\"",
        "The current paper is an attempt to systematically approach one aspect of this complexity.",
        "2 Approach Our approach is based on the usual assumption that there is a correlation between the patterns of word-co-occurrence across languages.",
        "However, instead of presupposing a bilingual dictionary it only requires pre-aligned comparable documents, i.e. small or medium sized documents aligned across languages which are known to deal with similar topics.",
        "This could be, for example, newspaper articles, scientific papers, contributions to discussion groups, or encyclopaedic articles.",
        "As Wikipedia is a large resource and readily available for many languages, we decided to base our study on this encyclopaedia.",
        "The Wikipedias have the so-called interlanguage links which are manually inserted by the authors and connect articles referring to the same headword in different languages.",
        "Given that each Wikipedia community contributes in its own language, only occasionally an article connected in this way will be an exact translation of a foreign language article, and in most cases the contents will be rather different.",
        "On the positive side, the link structure of the interlanguage links tends to be quite dense.",
        "For example, of the 1,114,696 German Wikipedia articles, 603,437 have a link to the corresponding English Wikipedia article.",
        "2.1 Pre-processing and MWE extraction We used the same versions of Wikipedia as in Rapp et al. (2012) and used the same processing.",
        "After download, each Wikipedia was minimally processed to extract the plain text contents of the articles.",
        "In this process all templates, e.g. 'infoboxes', as well as tables were removed, and we kept only the webpages with more than 500 characters of running text (including white space).",
        "Linguistic processing steps included to-kenisation, tagging and lemmatisation using the default UTF-8 versions of the respective Tree-Tagger resources (Schmid, 1994).",
        "From the pre-processed English and German Wikipedia, we extracted the multiword expressions using two simple principles, a negative POS filter and a containment filter.",
        "The negative POS filter operates in a rule-based fashion on the complete list of n-grams by removing the unlikely candidates according to a set of con-straints, such as the presence of determiners or prepositions at the edges of expressions, see a similar method used by (Justeson & Katz, 1995).",
        "With some further extensions this was also used to produce the multiword lists for the dictionary of translation equivalents (Babych et al., 2007).",
        "We did not use positive shallow filters.",
        "These would need to capture the relatively complex structure of the noun, verb and prepositional phrases, while avoiding noise.",
        "This can often lead to a lack of recall when more complex constructions cannot be captured.",
        "In contrast, negative shallow filters simply avoid obvious noise, while passing other multiword expressions (MWEs) through, which are very often legitimate syntactic constructions in a language in question.",
        "For example, the following English filters1 rejected personal pronouns (PP) and conjunctions (CC) at the edges of expressions (using the Penn Treebank tagset as implemented by Treetagger): ^[^ ]+~~PP |~~PP$ ^[^ ]+~~CC |~~CC$ Similarly, any MWE candidates including proper nouns (NP) and numerals (CD) were discarded: ~~NP ~~CD In the end, this helps in improving the recall rate while using a relatively small number of pat-terns: 18 patterns were used for English, 11 for German.",
        "The containment filter further rejects MWEs by removing those that regularly occur as a part of a longer acceptable MWE.",
        "For example, graphical user is an acceptable expression passing through the POS filter, but it is rejected by the containment filter since the overwhelming majority of its uses are in the containing MWE graphical user interface (1507 vs 1304 uses in Wikipedia, since MWEs are still possible, e.g., graphical user environment).",
        "1 We use here the standard notation for regular expressions as implemented in Perl (Friedl, 2002).",
        "For example, '^' means 'beginning of line' and '$' means 'end of line'.",

        "2.2 Keyterm extraction As the aligned English and German Wikipedia documents are typically not translations of each other, we cannot apply the usual procedures and tools as available for parallel texts (e.g. the Gale & Church sentence aligner and the Giza++ word alignment tool).",
        "Instead we conduct a two step procedure: 1.",
        "We first extract salient terms (single word or multiword) from each of the documents.",
        "2.",
        "We then align these terms across languages using an approach inspired by a connectionist (Rumelhart & McClelland, 1987) Winner-Takes-It-All Network.",
        "The respective algorithm is called WINTIAN and is described in Rapp et al. (2012) and in Rapp (1996).",
        "For term extraction, the occurrence frequency of a term in a particular document is compared to its average occurrence frequency in all Wikipedia documents, whereby a high discrepancy indicates a strong keyness.",
        "Following Rayson & Garside (2000), we use the log-likelihood score to measure keyness, since it has been shown to be robust to small numbers of instances.",
        "This robustness is important as many Wikipedia articles are rather short.",
        "This procedure leads to multiword keyterms as exemplified in Table 1 for the Wikipedia entry Airbus A320 family.",
        "Because of compounding in German, many single-word German expressions are translated into multiword expressions in English.",
        "So we chose to include single-word expressions into the German candidate list for alignment with English multiwords.",
        "One of the problems in obtaining multiword keyterms from the Wikipedia articles is relative data sparseness.",
        "Usually, the frequency of an individual multiword expression within a Wikipedia article is between 2 and 4.",
        "Therefore we had to use a less conservative threshold of 6.63 (1% significance level) rather than the more standard 15.13 (0.01% significance level) for the log-likelihood score (see Rayson & Garside, 2000, and http://ucrel.",
        "lancs.ac.uk/llwizard.html).",
        "2.3 Term alignment The WINTIAN algorithm is used for establishing term alignments across languages.",
        "As a more detailed technical description is given in Rapp et al. (2012) and in Rapp (1996), we only briefly describe this algorithm here, thereby focusing on the neural network analogy.",
        "The algorithm can be considered as an artificial neural network where the nodes are all English and German 89 terms occurring in the keyterm lists.",
        "Each English term has connections to all German terms.",
        "The connections are all initialized with values of one when the algorithm is started, but will serve as a measure of the translation probabilities after the completion of the algorithm.",
        "One after the other, the network is fed with the pairs of corresponding keyterm lists.",
        "Each German term activates the corresponding German node with an activity of one.",
        "This activity is then propagated to all English terms occurring in the corresponding list of keyterms.",
        "The distribution of the activity is not equal, but in proportion to the connecting weights.",
        "This unequal distribution has no effect at the beginning when all weights are one, but later on leads to rapid activity increases for pairs of terms which often occur in corresponding keyterm lists.",
        "The assumption is that these are translations of each other.",
        "Using Hebbian learning (Rumelhart & McClelland, 1987) the activity changes are stored in the connections.",
        "We use a heuristic to avoid the effect that frequent keyterms dominate the network: When more than 50 of the connections to a particular English node have weights higher than one, the weakest 20 of them are reset to one.",
        "This way only translations which are frequently confirmed can build up high weights.",
        "It turned out that the algorithm shows a robust behaviour in practice, which is important as the corresponding keyterm lists tend to be very noisy and, especially for multiword expressions, in many cases may contain hardly any terms that are actually translations of each other.",
        "Reasons are that corresponding Wikipedia articles are often written from different perspectives, that the variation in length can be considerable across languages, and that multiword expressions tend to show more variability with regard to their translations than single words.",
        "3 Results and evaluation 3.1 Results for single words In this subsection we report on our previous results for single words (Rapp et al., 2012) as these serve as a baseline for our new results concerning multiword units.",
        "The WINTIAN algorithm requires as input vocabularies of the source and the target language.",
        "For both English and German, we constructed these as follows: Based on the keyword lists for the respective Wikipedia, we counted the number of occurrences of each keyword, and then applied a threshold of five, i.e. all keywords with a lower frequency were eliminated.",
        "The reasoning behind this is that rare keywords are of not much use due to data sparseness.",
        "This resulted in a vocabulary size of 133,806 for Eng-lish, and of 144,251 for German.",
        "Using the WINTIAN algorithm, the English translations for all 144,251 words occurring in the German vocabulary were computed.",
        "Table 2 shows the results for the German word Stra?e (which means street).",
        "For a quantitative evaluation we used the ML1000 test set comprising 1000 English-German translations (see Rapp et al., 2012).",
        "We verified in how many cases our algorithm had assigned the expected translation (as provided by the gold standard) the top rank among all 133,806 translation candidates.",
        "(Candidates are all words occurring in the English vocabulary.)",
        "This was the case for 381 of the 1000 items, which gives us an accuracy of 38.1%.",
        "Let us mention that this result refers to exact matches with the word equations in the gold standard.",
        "As in reality due to word ambiguity other translations might also be acceptable (e.g. for Stra?e not only street but also road would be accept-able), these figures are conservative and can be seen as a lower bound of the actual performance.",
        "GIVEN GERMAN WORD Stra?e EXPECTED TRANSLATION street LL-SCORE TRANSLATION 1 215.3 road 2 148.2 street 3 66.0 traffic 4 46.0 Road 5 42.6 route 6 34.6 building Table 2.",
        "Computed translations for Stra?e.",
        "3.2 Results for multiword expressions In analogy to the procedure for single words, for the WINTIAN algorithm we also needed to define English and German vocabularies of multiword terms.",
        "For English, we selected all multiword terms which occurred at least three times in the lists of English key terms, and for German those which occurred at least four times in the lists of German key terms.",
        "This resulted in similar sized vocabularies of 114,796 terms for Eng-lish, and 131,170 for German.",
        "Note that the threshold for German had to be selected higher not because German has more inflectional variants (which does not matter as we are working 90 with lemmatized data), but because other than the English the German vocabulary also includes unigrams.",
        "The reason for this is that German is highly compositional, so that English multiword units are often translated by German unigrams.",
        "Using the WINTIAN algorithm, the English translations for all 131,170 words occurring in the German multiword vocabulary were com-puted, and in another run the German translations for all 114,796 English words.",
        "Table 3 shows some sample results.",
        "For a quantitative evaluation, we did not have a gold standard at hand.",
        "As multiword expressions show a high degree of variability with regard to their translations, so that it is hard to come up with all possibilities, we first decided not to construct a gold standard, but instead did a manual evaluation.",
        "For this purpose, we randomly selected 100 of the German multiword expressions with an occurrence frequency above nine, and verified their computed translations (i.e. the top ranked item for each) manually.",
        "We distinguished three categories: 1) Acceptable translation; 2) Associatively related to an acceptable translation; 3) Unrelated to an acceptable translation.",

        "Such data we had readily at hand from a previous project called COMTRANS.",
        "During this project we had constructed a large bilingual dictionary of bigrams, i.e. of pairs of adjacent words in the source language.",
        "For constructing the dic-tionary, we word-aligned the English and German parts of the Europarl corpus.",
        "For this pur-pose, using Moses default settings, we combined two symmetric runs of Giza++, which considerably improves alignment quality.",

        "Discontinuities of one or several word positions were allowed and were indicated by the wildcard ?*?.",
        "As the above method for word alignment produces many unjustified empty assignments (i.e. assignments where a source language word pair is erroneously assumed to have no equivalent in the target language sentence), so that the majority of these is incorrect, all empty assignments were removed from the dictionary.",
        "In the dictionary, for each source language word pair its absolute frequency and the absolute and relative frequencies of its translation(s) are given.",
        "To filter out spurious assignments, thresholds of 2 for the absolute and 10% for the relative frequency of a translation were used.",

        "This is why, after some preliminary experiments with various thresholds, we finally decided to disable the log-likelihood threshold.",
        "In-stead, on the English side, all keyterms from the gold standard were used if they occurred at least once in the respective Wikipedia document.",
        "On the German side, as here we had many unigram compounds which tend to be more stable and therefore more repetitive than MWEs, we used the keyterms if the occurred at least twice.",
        "This way for most documents we obtained at least a few keyterms.",
        "When running the WINTIAN algorithm on the parallel keyword lists, in some cases reasonable results were obtained.",
        "For example, for the direction English to German, the system translates information society with Informationsgesell-schaft, and education policy with Bildungs-politik.",
        "As WINTIAN is symmetric and can likewise produce a dictionary in the opposite di-rection, we also generated the results for German to English.",
        "Here, among the good examples, are Telekommunikationsmarkt, which is translated as telecommunications market, and Werbekam-pagne, which is translated as advertising campaign.",
        "However, these are selected examples showing that the algorithm works in principle.",
        "Of more interest is the quantitative evaluation which is based on thousands of test words and uses the gold standard dictionary.",
        "For English to German we obtained an accuracy of 0.77% if only the top ranked word is taken into account, i.e. if this word matches the expected translation.",
        "This improves to 1.6% if it suffices that the expected translation is ranked among the top ten words.",
        "The respective figures for German to English are 1.41% and 2.04%.",
        "The finding that German to English performs better can be explained by the fact that other than English German is a highly inflectional language.",
        "That is, when generating translations it is more likely for German that an inflectional variant not matching the gold standard translation is ranked first, thus adversely affecting performance.",
        "A question more difficult to answer is why the results based on the gold standard are considerably worse than the ones reported in section 3.2 which were based on human judgment.",
        "We see the following reasons: ?",
        "The evaluation in section 3.2 used only a small sample so might be not very reliable.",
        "Also, other than here, it considered only source language words with frequencies above nine.",
        "?",
        "Unlike the candidate expressions, the gold standard data is not lemmatized on the target language side.",
        "?",
        "The hard string matching used for the gold-standard-based evaluation does not allow for inflectional variants.",
        "?",
        "The gold-standard-based evaluation used terms resulting from the intersection of term lists based on Wikipedia and Europarl.",
        "It is clear that this led to a reduction of average term frequency (if measured on the basis of Wikipedia), thus increasing the problem of data sparseness.",
        "?",
        "As for the same reason the log-likelihood threshold had to be abandoned, on average less salient terms had to be used.",
        "This is likely to additionally reduce accuracy.",
        "?",
        "For many terms the gold standard lists several possible translations.",
        "In the current implementation of the evaluation algorithm only one of them is counted as correct.",
        "3 However, in the human evaluation any reasonable translation was accepted.",
        "?",
        "Some reasonable MWE candidates extracted from Wikipedia are not present in the gold standard, for example credible evidence, credible source, and credible witness are not frequent enough in Europarl to be selected for alignment.",
        "We should perhaps mention that it would be possible to come up with better looking accuracies by presenting results for selected subsets of the source language terms.",
        "For example, one could concentrate on terms with particularly good cov-3 This can be justified because an optimal algorithm should provide all possible translations of a term.",
        "If only some translations are provided, only partial credit should be given.",
        "But this is likely to average out over large numbers, so the simple version seems acceptable.",
        "93 erage.",
        "Another possibility would be to consider MWEs consisting of nouns only.",
        "This we actually did by limiting source and target language vocabulary (of MWEs) to compound nouns.",
        "The results were as follows: English to German (top 1): 1.81% English to German (top 10): 3.75% German to English (top 1): 2.03% German to English (top 10): 3.16% As can be seen, these results look somewhat better.",
        "But this is only for the reason that translating compound nouns appears to be a comparatively easier task on average.",
        "4 Conclusions and future work We have presented a method for identifying term translations using aligned comparable documents.",
        "Although it is based on a knowledge poor approach and does not presuppose a seed lexi-con, it delivers competitive results for single words.",
        "A disadvantage of our method is that it presupposes that the alignments of the comparable documents are known.",
        "On the other hand, there are methods for finding such alignments automatically not only in special cases such as Wikipedia and newspaper texts, but also in the case of unstructured texts (although these methods may require a seed lexicon).",
        "Concerning the question from the introduc-tion, namely whether the translation (and consequently also the meaning) of a multiword unit is determined compositionally or contextually, our answer is as follows: For the type of multiword units we were investigating, namely automatically extracted collocations, our results indicate that looking at their contextual behavior usually does not suffice.",
        "The reasons seem to be that their contextual behavior shows a high degree of variability, that their translations tend to be less salient than those of single words, and that the problem of data sparseness is considerably more severe.",
        "It must be seen, however, that there are many types of multiword expressions, such as idioms, metaphorical expressions, named entities, fixed phrases, noun compounds, compound verbs, compound adjectives, and so on, so that our results are not automatically applicable to all of them.",
        "Therefore, in future work we intend to compare the behavior of different types of multiword expressions (e.g. multiword named entities and short phrases such as those used in phrase-based machine translations) and to quantify in how far their behavior is compositional or contextual.",
