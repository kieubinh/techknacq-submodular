        "Discourse analysis is one of the most challenging tasks in Natural Language Processing that has applications in many language technology areas such as opinion mining, summarization, information extraction, etc.",
        "(see (Webber et al., 2011) and (Taboada and Mann, 2006) for detailed re-view).",
        "The release of the large discourse relation annotated corpora, such as Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008), marked the development of statistical discourse parsers (Lin et al., 2012; Ghosh et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2012; Stepanov and Riccardi, 2013).",
        "Recently, PDTB-style discourse annotation was applied to biomedical domain and Biomedical Discourse Relation Bank (BioDRB) (Prasad et al., 2011) was released.",
        "This milestone marks the beginning of the research on cross-domain evaluation and domain adaptation of PDTB-style discourse parsers.",
        "In this paper we address the question of how well PDTB-trained discourse parser (news-wire domain) can extract argument spans of explicit discourse relations in BioDRB (biomedical domain).",
        "The use cases of discourse parsing in biomedical domain are discussed in detail in (Prasad et al., 2011).",
        "Here, on the other hand, we provide very general connection between the two.",
        "The goal of Biomedical Text Mining (BioNLP) is to retrieve and organize biomedical knowledge from scientific publications; and detecting discourse relations such as contrast and causality is an important step towards this goal (Prasad et al., 2011).",
        "To illustrate this point consider a quote from (Brunner and Wirth, 2006), given below.",
        "The addition of an anti-Oct2 antibody did not interfere with complex formation (Figure 3, lane 6), since HeLa cells do not express Oct2.",
        "(Cause:Reason) In the example, the discourse connective since signals a causal relation between the clauses it connects.",
        "That is, the reason why ?the addition of an anti-Oct2 antibody did not interfere with complex formation?",
        "is ?HeLa cells?",
        "not expressing Oct2?.",
        "PDTB adopts non-hierarchical binary view on discourse relations: Argument 1 (Arg1) (in italics in the example) and Argument 2 (Arg2), which is syntactically attached to a discourse connective (in bold).",
        "Thus, a discourse relation is a triplet of a connective and its two arguments.",
        "In the literature (Lin et al., 2012; Stepanov and Riccardi, 2013) PDTB-style discourse parsing is partitioned into discourse relation detection, argument position classification, argument span extraction, and relation sense classification.",
        "For the explicit discourse relations (i.e. signaled by a connective), discourse relation detection is cast as classification of connectives as discourse and non-discourse.",
        "Argument position classification, on the other hand, involves detection of the location of Arg1 with re-30 Discourse Connective Detection Argument Position Classif.",
        "SS Arg2 Extraction SS Arg1 Extraction PS Arg1 Candidate Heuristic PS Arg2 Extraction PS Arg1 Extraction SS PS Figure 1: Discourse Parser Architecture.",
        "(CRF Argument Span Extraction models are in bold.)",
        "spect to Arg2, that is to detect whether a relation is inter-or intra-sentential.",
        "Argument span extraction is the extraction (labeling) of text segments that belong to each of the arguments.",
        "Finally, relation sense classification is the annotation of relations with the senses from the sense hierarchy (PDTB or BioDRB).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, the only subtasks that were addressed cross-domain are the detection of explicit discourse connectives (Ramesh and Yu, 2010; Ramesh et al., 2012; Faiz and Mercer, 2013) and relation sense classification (Prasad et al., 2011).",
        "While the discourse parser of Faiz and Mercer (2013) 1 provides models for both domains and does identification of argument head words in the style of Wellner and Pustejovsky (2007); there is no decision made on arguments spans.",
        "More-over, there is no cross-domain evaluation available for each of the models.",
        "In this paper we address the task of cross-domain argument span extraction of explicit discourse relations.",
        "Additionally, we provide evaluation for cross-domain argument position classification as far as the data allows, since BioDRB lacks manual sentence segmentation.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we present the comparative analysis of PDTB and BioDRB corpora and the relevant works on cross-domain discourse parsing.",
        "In Section 3 we describe the PDTB discourse parser used for cross-domain experiments.",
        "In Section 4 we present the evaluation methodology and the experimental results.",
        "Section 5 provides concluding remarks.",
        "2 PDTB vs. BioDRB Corpora Analysis and Related Cross-Domain Works The two corpora used in our experiments are Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008) 1 Made available on https://code.google.com/ p/discourse-parser/ and Biomedical Discourse Relation Bank (Bio- DRB) (Prasad et al., 2011).",
        "Both corpora follow the same discourse relation annotation style over different domain corpora: PDTB is annotated on top of Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus (financial news-wire domain); and it is aligned with Penn Treebank (PTB) syntactic tree annotation; Bio-DRB, on the other hand, is a corpus annotated over 24 open access full-text articles from the GENIA corpus (Kim et al., 2003) (biomedical domain), and, unlike PDTB, there is no reference tokenization or syntactic parse trees.",
        "The detailed comparison of the corpora is out of the scope of this paper, and it is available in (Prasad et al., 2011).",
        "Similarly, the review of PDTB-style discourse parsing literature is not in its scope.",
        "Here, on the other hand, we focus on the corpus differences relevant for discourse parsing tasks and cross-domain application of discourse parsing subtasks.",
        "Discourse relations in both corpora are binary: Arg1 and Arg2, where Arg2 is an argument syntactically attached to a discourse connective.",
        "With respect to Arg2, Arg1 can appear in the same sentence (SS case), one or several of the preceding (PS case) or following (FS case) sentences.",
        "A discourse connective is a member of a well defined list of connectives and a relation expressed via such connective is an Explicit relation.",
        "There are other types of discourse and non-discourse relations annotated in the corpora; however, they are out of the scope of this paper.",
        "Discourse relations are annotated using a hierarchy of senses: even though the organization of senses and the number of levels are different between corpora, the most general top level senses are mapped to the PDTB top level senses: Comparison, Contingency, Ex-pansion, and Temporal (Prasad et al., 2011).",
        "The difference between the two corpora with respect to discourse connectives is that in case of PDTB the annotated connectives belong to one of the three syntactic classes: subordinating conjunctions (e.g. because), coordinating conjunctions (e.g. but), and discourse adverbials (e.g. how-ever), while BioDRB is also annotated for a forth syntactic class ?",
        "subordinators (e.g. by).",
        "There are 100 unique connective types in PDTB (after connectives like 1 year after are stemmed to after) in 18,459 explicit discourse relations.",
        "Whereas in BioDRB there are 123 unique connective types in 2,636 relations.",
        "According to 31 the discourse connective analysis in (Ramesh et al., 2012), the subordinators comprise 33% of all connective types in BioDRB.",
        "Additionally, 11% of connective types in common syntactic classes that occur in BioDRB do not occur in PDTB; e.g.",
        "In summary, as a consequence.",
        "Thus, only 56% of connective types of BioDRB are common to both corpora.",
        "While in-domain discourse connective detection has good performance (Ramesh and Yu, 2010), this difference makes the cross-domain identification of discourse connectives a hard task, which is exemplified by experiments in (Ramesh and Yu, 2010) (F 1 = 0.55).",
        "With respect to relation sense classification, the connective surface provides already high baselines (Prasad et al., 2011).",
        "However, cross-domain sense classification experiments indicate that there are significant differences in the semantic usage of connectives between two domains, since the performance of the classifier trained on PDTB does not generalize well to BioDRB (F 1 = 0.57).",
        "To sum up, the corpora differences with respect to discourse connective usage affect the cross-domain generalization of connective detection and sense classification tasks negatively.",
        "The experiments in this paper are intended to evaluate the generalization of argument span extraction, assuming that the connective is already identified.",
        "In the following section, we present the PDTB-trained discourse parser optimized for in-domain performance.",
        "3 PDTB-Style Discourse Parser The discourse parser (see Figure 1) is a combination of argument position classification model for classifying discourse connectives as inter-or intra-sentential, and specific Conditional Random Fields argument extraction models for each of the arguments in these configurations.",
        "In the following subsections we provide descriptions for each of the components.",
        "3.1 Argument Position Classification Discourse connectives have a very strong preference on the location of the Arg1 with respect to their syntactic category (Subordinating Conjunc-tion, Coordinating Conjunction, and Discourse Adverbial) and position in the sentence (sentence initial or sentence medial); thus, classification of discourse connectives into inter-sentential or intra-sentential is an easy task yielding high supervised machine learning performance (Stepanov and Ric-cardi, 2013; Lin et al., 2012).",
        "With respect to the decision made in this step a specific argument span extraction model is applied.",
        "For Argument Position Classification the un-igram BoosTexter (Schapire and Singer, 2000) model with 100 iterations is trained on PDTB sections 02-22 and tested on sections 23-24.",
        "Similar to the previously published results, it has a high performace: F1 = 98.12.",
        "The features are connective surface string, POS-tags, and IOB-chains.",
        "The results obtained with automatic sentence splitting, tokenization, and syntactic parsing using Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) are also high F1 = 97.81.",
        "Since, unlike PTB for PDTB, for BioDRB there is no manual sentence splitting, tokenization, and syntactic tree annotation; the precise cross-domain evaluation of Argument Span Extraction step is not possible.",
        "However, in Section 4 we estimate the performance using automatic sentence splitting.",
        "3.2 Argument Span Extraction Argument span extraction is cast as token-level sequence labeling using Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "Previously, it was observed that in PDTB for inter-sentential discourse relations Arg1 precedes Arg2 in most of the cases.",
        "Thus, the CRF models are trained for the configurations where both of the arguments are in the same sentence (SS), and for Arg1 in one of the previous sentences (PS); the following sentence Arg1 case (FS) is ignored due to too few training instances being available (in PDTB 8 / 18,459).",
        "Consequently, there are 4 CRF models SS Arg1 and Arg2, and PS Arg1 and Arg2.",
        "Same sentence case models are applied in a cas-cade, such that output of Arg2 model is used as a feature for Arg1 span extraction.",
        "For the case of Arg1 in the previous sentences; based on the observation that in PDTB Arg2 span is fully located in the sentence containing the connective in 98.5% of instances; and Arg1 span is fully located in the sentence immediately preceding Arg2 in 71.7% of instances; the sentences in these positions are selected and CRF models are trained to label the spans.",
        "The features used for training the models are presented in Table 1.",
        "The feature sets are optimized for each of the arguments in (Ghosh et al., 2011) (see the Table columns Arg1 and Arg2).",
        "Be-32 sides the features commonly used in NLP tasks such that token, lemma, inflectional affixes, and part-of-speech tag, the rest of the features are: ?",
        "IOB-Chain (IOB) is the path string of the syntactic tree nodes from the root node to the to-ken, prefixed with the information whether a token is at the beginning (B-) or inside (I-) the constituent.",
        "The chunklink tool (Buch- holz, 2000) is used to extract this feature from syntactic trees.",
        "?",
        "PDTB Level 1 Connective sense (CONN) is the most general sense of a connective in PDTB sense hierarchy.",
        "It's general purpose is to label the discourse connective tokens, i.e. the value of the feature is ?NULL?",
        "for all tokens except the discourse connective.",
        "?",
        "Boolean Main Verb (BMV) is a boolean feature that indicates whether a token is a main verb of a sentence or not (Yamada and Mat-sumoto, 2003).",
        "?",
        "Arg2 Label (ARG2) is an output of Arg2 span extraction model, that is used as a feature for Arg1 span extraction.",
        "Arg2 span is easier to identify (Ghosh et al., 2011; Stepanov and Riccardi, 2013) since it is syntactically attached to the discourse connective.",
        "Thus, this feature serves to constrain the Arg1 search space for intra-sentential argument span extraction.",
        "The value of the feature is either ARG2 suffixed for whether a token is Inside (I), Begin (B), or End (E) of the span, or ?O?",
        "if it does not belong to the Arg2 span.",
        "These features are expanded during training with n-grams (feature of CRF++ 2 ): tokens with 2-grams in the window of ?1 tokens, and the rest of the features with 2 & 3-grams in the window of ?2 tokens.",
        "The in-domain performance of argument span extraction models is provided in the following section, after the description of the evaluation methodology.",
        "4 Experiments and Results In this Section we first describe the evaluation methodology and then the experiments on cross-domain evaluation of argument position classification and argument span extraction models.",
        "2 https://code.google.com/p/crfpp/ Feature ABBR Arg2 Arg1 Token TOK Y Y POS-Tag POS Lemma LEM Y Y Inflection INFL Y Y IOB-Chain IOB Y Y Connective Sense CONN Y Y Boolean Main Verb BMV Y Arg2 Label ARG2 Y Table 1: Feature sets for Arg2 and Arg1 argument span extraction.",
        "The experimental settings for PDTB are the fol-lowing: Sections 02-22 are used for training and Sections 23-24 for testing.",
        "For BioDRB, on the other hand, 12 fold cross-validation is used (2 documents in each fold, since in BioDRB there are 24 documents).",
        "4.1 Evaluation Methodology The performance of Argument Span Extraction is evaluated in terms of precision (p), recall (r), and F-measure (F 1 ) using the equations 1 ?",
        "3.",
        "An argument span is considered to be correct, if it exactly matches the reference string.",
        "Following (Ghosh et al., 2011) and (Lin et al., 2012), argument initial and final punctuation marks are removed .",
        "p = Exact Match Exact Match + No Match (1) r = Exact Match References in Gold (2) F 1 = 2 ?",
        "p ?",
        "r p + r (3) In the equations, Exact Match is the count of correctly tagged argument spans; No Match is the count of argument spans that do not match the reference string exactly, i.e. even a single token difference is counted as an error; and References in Gold is the total number of arguments in the reference.",
        "Since argument span extraction is applied after argument position classification, the classification error is propagated.",
        "Thus, for the evaluation of argument span extraction, misclassified instances are reflected in the counts of Exact Matches and No Matches.",
        "For example, misclassified same sentence relation results in that both its arguments are 33 Arg2 Arg1 P R F1 P R F1 Gold SS 90.36 87.49 88.90 70.27 66.67 68.42 PS 79.01 77.10 78.04 46.23 36.61 40.86 ALL 85.93 83.45 84.67 61.94 54.98 58.25 Auto SS 86.83 85.14 85.98 64.26 63.01 63.63 PS 75.00 73.67 74.33 37.66 37.00 37.33 ALL 82.24 80.69 81.46 53.93 52.92 53.42 Table 2: In-domain performance of the PDTB-trained argument span extraction models on the test set with ?Gold?",

        "considered as not recalled for the SS, and for the PS they are considered as No Match.",
        "However, we do not propagate error in cross-domain evaluation on BioDRB, since there is no reference information.",
        "Additionally, while Arg1 span extraction models are trained on Gold Arg2 features, for testing they are always automatic.",
        "4.2 Cross-Domain Argument Position Classification As it was mentioned above, there is no manual sentence splitting for BioDRB; thus, there is no references for whether a discourse relation has its Arg1 in the same or different sentences.",
        "In order to evaluate cross-domain argument position classification we evaluate classifier decisions against automatic sentence splitting using Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) on whole of BioDRB.",
        "The BoosTexter model described in Section 3.1 has a high in-domain performance of 97.81.",
        "On BioDRB its performance is 95.26, which is still high.",
        "Thus, we can conclude that argument position classification generalizes well cross-domain, and that it is little affected by the presence of ?sub- ordinators?",
        "that were not annotated in PDTB.",
        "4.3 In-Domain Argument Span Extraction: PDTB The in-domain performance of the argument span extraction models trained on PDTB sections 02-22 and tested on sections 23-24 is given on Table 2.",
        "The results are for 2 settings: ?Gold?",
        "and ?Auto?.",
        "In the ?Gold?",
        "settings the sentence splitting, tokenization and syntactic features are extracted from PTB, and in the ?Auto?",
        "they are extracted from automatic parse trees obtained using Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003).",
        "The general trend in the literature, is that the argument span extraction for Arg1 has lower performance than for Arg2, which is expected since Arg2 position is signaled by a discourse connective.",
        "Ad-ditionally, Previous Sentence Arg1 model performance is much lower than that of the other models due to the fact that it only considers immediately previous sentence; which, as was mentioned ear-lier, covers only 71.7% of the inter-sentential relations.",
        "In the next subsections, these models are evaluated on biomedical domain.",
        "4.4 In-Domain Argument Span Extraction: BioDRB In order to evaluate PDTB-BioDRB cross-domain performance we first evaluate the in-domain BioDRB argument span extraction.",
        "Since there is no gold sentence splitting, tokenization and syntactic parse trees, the models are trained using the features extracted from automatic parse trees.",
        "We use exactly the same feature sets as for PDTB models, which are optimized for PDTB.",
        "An important aspect is that in BioDRB the connective senses are different: there are 16 top level senses that are mapped to 4 top level PDTB senses.",
        "For the in-domain BioDRB models, the 16 senses were kept as is.",
        "Since we do not have gold argument position information, we do not train in-domain argument classification model.",
        "Thus, the reported results are without error propagation.",
        "Later, this will allow us to assess cross-domain argument span extraction performance better.",
        "The results reported in Table 3 are average precision, recall and f-measure of 12-fold cross-validation.",
        "With respect to automatic sentence splitting, there are 717 inter-sentential and 1,919 intra-sentential relations (27% to 73%).",
        "Thus, BioDRB is less affected by PS Arg1 performance than PDTB models, where the ratio is 619 to 976 (39% to 61%).",
        "Additionally, BioDRB PS Arg1 performance is generally higher than that of PDTB.",

        "The cross-domain performance of the models described in Section 4.3 is given in the Table 4 under the ?Gold?.",
        "To make the cross-domain evaluation settings closer to the BioDRB in-domain evaluation, we additionally train PDTB models on the automatic features, i.e. features extracted from PDTB with automatic sentence split-ting, tokenization and syntactic parsing.",
        "Similar to the in-domain BioDRB evaluation, results are reported without error propagation from argument position classification step.",
