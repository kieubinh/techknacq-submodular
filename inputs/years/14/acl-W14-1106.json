        "SNOMED Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) (IHTSDO, 2014) is considered the most com-prehensive, multilingual clinical healthcare terminology in the world.",
        "The use of a standard clinical terminology improves the quality and health care by enabling consistent representation of meaning in an electronic health record 1 .",
        "Osakidetza, the Basque Sanitary System ought to provide its service in the two co-official languages of the Basque Autonomous Community, in Spanish and in Basque.",
        "However, and being Basque a minority language in front of the powerful Spanish language, the use of Basque in the documentation services (for example in the Electronic Medical Records (EMR)) of Osakidetza, is almost zero.",
        "One of our goals in this work is to offer a medical terminology in Basque to the bio-medical personnel to try to enforce the use of Basque in the bio-sanitary area and in this way protect the 1 http://www.ihtsdo.org/snomed-ct/whysnomedct/ snomedfeatures/ linguistic rights of patients and doctors.",
        "Another objective in this work is to be able to access multilingual medical resources in Basque language.",
        "To try to reach the mentioned objectives, we want to semi-automatically translate the terminology content of SNOMED CT focusing in some of its main hierarchies.",
        "To achieve our translation goal, we have defined an algorithm that is based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and that is composed of four phases.",
        "In this paper we show the systems and results obtained when developing the first two phases of the algorithm that, in this case, translates English terms into Basque.",
        "The first phase of the algorithm is based on the use of multilingual lexical resources, while the second one uses a finite-state approach to obtain Basque equivalent terms using medical affixes and also transcription rules.",
        "In this paper we will leave aside explanations about i) the translation application, ii) the knowledge management and iii) the knowledge repre-sentation, and we will focus on term generation.",
        "The application framework that manages the terms has been already developed and it is in use.",
        "The knowledge representation schema has been designed and implemented and it is also being used (Perez-de-Vin?aspre and Oronoz, 2013).",
        "In the rest of the paper after motivating the work and connecting it to other SNOMED CT translations (sections 2 and 3), the algorithm and the material that are needed to implement the first two phases of the translation-algorithm are described (section 4).",
        "After that, results are shown and discussed (sections 5 and 6).",
        "Finally, some conclusions and future work are listed in the last section (section 7).",
        "2 Background and significance ?Basque is the ancestral language of the Basque people, who inhabit the Basque Country, a region 38 spanning an area in northeastern Spain and south-western France.",
        "It is spoken by 27% of Basques in all territories (714,136 out of 2,648,998).",
        "Of these, 663,035 live in the Spanish part of the Basque country (Basque Country and Navarre) and the remaining 51,100 live in the French part (Pyre?ne?es- Atlantiques) 2 ?.",
        "Basque is a minority language in its standardization process and persists between two powerful languages, Spanish and French.",
        "Although today Basque holds co-official language status in the Basque Autonomous Community, during centuries Basque was not an official lan-guage; it was out of educational systems, out of media, and out of industrial environments.",
        "Due to this features, the use of the Basque Language in the bio-sanitary system is low.",
        "One of the reasons for translating SNOMED CT is to try to increase the use of the Basque language in this area.",
        "SNOMED CT is a multilingual resource as its concepts are linked to terms in different languages by means of a concept identifier.",
        "Thus, terms in our language will be linked to terms in all the languages in which SNOMED CT is released.",
        "Be-sides, as SNOMED CT is part of the Metathe-saurus of UMLS (Unified Medical Language System (Bodenreider, 2004)), Basque speakers will have the possibility of accessing other lexical medical resources (RxNorm, MeSH) containing the concepts of SNOMED CT. SNOMED CT has been already translated to other languages using different techniques.",
        "These translations were done either manually (this is the case of the Danish language (Petersen, 2011)), combining automatic translation with manual work (in Chinese, for example (Zhu et al., 2012)), or using exclusively an automatic translation helping system (that is the case of French (Abdoune et al., 2011)).",
        "In the design of the translation task, we have followed the guidelines for the translation of SNOMED CT (H?y, 2010) published by the IHTSDO as it is recommended.",
        "3 SNOMED CT SNOMED CT provides the core terminology for electronic health records and contains more than 296,000 active concepts with their descriptions organized into hierarchies.",
        "(Humphreys et al., 1997) shows that SNOMED CT has an acceptable coverage of the terminology needed to record patient 2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque language (January 23, 2014) conditions.",
        "Concepts are defined by means of description logic axioms and are used also to group terms with the same meaning.",
        "Those descriptions are more generally considered as terms.",
        "There are three types of descriptions in SNOMEDCT: Fully Specified Names (FSN), Preferred Terms (PT) and Synonyms.",
        "Fully Specified Names are the descriptions used to identify the concepts and they usually have a semantic tag in parenthesis that indicates its semantic type and, consequently, its hierarchy.",
        "Regarding what we sometimes refer to as ?terms?",
        "we can distinguish between PTs and Synonyms.",
        "There are 19 hierarchies to organize the content of SNOMED CT (plus 1 hierarchy for meta-data).",
        "The concepts of SNOMED CT are grouped into hierarchies as Clinical finding/disorder, Or-ganism, and so on.",
        "For translation purposes it is important to deeply analyze these hierarchies as some of them need to translate all the terms while others as Organism only admit the translation of the synonyms (the preferred term should be the taxonomic one).",
        "The guidelines for the translation of the hierarchies are given in (H?y, 2010).",
        "We want to remark that only the terms classified as PTs and synonyms in SNOMED CT have been taken into consideration for the translation pur-poses, as the structure (relationships, for example) is the ontological core of SNOMED CT.",
        "Considering the lexical resources available in the bio-sanitary domain for Basque and the SNOMED CT language versions released, two source languages can be used for our translation task: English and Spanish.",
        "Basque is classified as a language isolate, and in consequence it is not related to English or Spanish and its linguistic characteristics are far away from both of them.",
        "For that reason, no English nor Spanish offers any advantage as translation source.",
        "Thus, we deeply analyzed both of them to choose the best option.",
        "Our starting point was the Release Format 2 (RF2), Snapshot distributions and the versions dated the 31-07-2012 for English and the 30-10-2012 for Spanish.",
        "It must be taken into consideration that the Spanish version of SNOMED CT is a manual translation of the English version.",
        "To choose the source version of SNOMED CT that will be translated, we analyzed aspects as i) general numbers of FSNs, PTs and Synonyms, ii) length of the terms in each language and, ii) the lack of elements in each version.",
        "These data help 39 us to come to a decision: 1.",
        "The number of active concepts in both languages is the same (296,433) as the Spanish version uses the English concept file.",
        "Nev-ertheless, the number of terms in Spanish is significantly smaller.",
        "In Spanish 15,715 concepts lack of PTs and Synonyms.",
        "2.",
        "Regarding the length of the PTs and syn-onyms, we counted the terms containing one token, two tokens, three tokens, four tokens and those with more than four tokens.",
        "In the English version the 6.76% of the terms has one token, the 23.28% two and the 20.70% three tokens.",
        "That is, quite simple terms compose the half of the synonyms in the lexicon.",
        "In the Spanish version, nevertheless, only the 33.79% of the synonyms has three tokens or less, and there are 66.21% synonyms with four tokens or more.",
        "Considering these data, we can conclude that i) the English version is more complete and consistent than the Spanish one, and that ii) the terms in the English version are shorter in length and, in consequence, simpler to translate than the ones in the Spanish version.",
        "Thus, we decided to use the English version of SNOMEDCT as the translation source as starting point.",
        "We fix the priority between hierarchies for the translation taking into account the number of terms in each hierarchy.",
        "The most populated hierarchies are Clinical finding/disorder (139,643 concepts) and Procedure (75,078 concepts).",
        "The next most populated hierarchies are Organism (35,870 concepts) and Body Structure (26,960).",
        "The translation guidelines indicate that the PTs of the organisms should not be translated.",
        "For this reason and being conscious of our limitation to translate this huge terminology, we decided to prioritize the translation of the Clinical find-ing/disorder, the Procedure and the Body Structure hierarchies.",
        "4 Translation Algorithm We have defined a general algorithm that tries to achieve the translation with an incremental approach.",
        "Although the design is general and the algorithm could be used for any language pair, some linguistic resources for the source and objective languages are necessary.",
        "In our implementation, the algorithm takes a term in English as input and obtains one or more equivalent terms in Basque.",
        "The mapping of SNOMED CT with ICD-10 works at concept level.",
        "Thus, before executing the implementation of the algorithm the mapping between them should be done (see section 5).",
        "The algorithm is composed of four main phases.",
        "The first two phases are already developed and results regarding quantities are given in section 5.",
        "The last two phases will be undertaken in the very near future.",
        "We want to remark that all the processes finish in the step numbered as 4 in the algorithm (see Figure 1).",
        "The Basque equivalents with their original English terms, and relative information (for instance, the SNOMED CT concept identi-fier) are stored in an XML document that follows the TermBase eXchange (TBX) (Melby, 2012) international standard (ISO 30042) as exposed in (Perez-de-Vin?aspre and Oronoz, 2013).",
        "All the lexical resources are stored in another simpler TBX document called ItzulDB (see number 1 in Figure 1).",
        "This document is initialized with all the lexical resources available, such as specialized dictionaries and it is enriched with the new translation pairs generated that overcome a confidence threshold with the intention of using them to translate new terms.",
        "In this way we achieve feedback.",
        "Let us describe the main phases: 1.",
        "Lexical knowledge.",
        "In this phase of the algorithm (see numbers 1-2-4 in Figure 1), some specialized dictionaries and the En-glish, Spanish and Basque versions of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health in its 10th version (ICD-10) are used.",
        "ItzulDB is initialized with all the translation pairs (English- Basque) extracted from different dictionaries of the bio-medical domain and the pairs extracted from the ICD-10.",
        "For example the input term ?abortus?",
        "will be stored with all its Basque equivalents ?abortu?, ?abortatze?",
        "and ?hilaurtze?.",
        "This XML database is enriched with the new elements that are generated when the algorithm is applied (number 4 in Figure 1).",
        "Figure 2 shows an example of some translations obtained using ItzulDB.",
        "2.",
        "Morphosemantics.",
        "When a simple term (term with a unique token) is not found in ItzulDB (number 3 in Figure 1) it is analyzed at word-level, and some generation-rules are used to 40 Figure 1: Schema of the Algorithm.",
        "Input term: Deoxyribonuclic acid Steps in Figure 1 number: 1,2,4 Translation: Azido desoxirribonukleiko, ADN, DNA Figure 2: Terms obtained from ItzulDB.",
        "create the translation.",
        "We apply medical suffix and prefix equivalences and morphotactic rules, as well as some transcription rules, for this purpose.",
        "This is the case in Figure 3.",
        "Input term: Photodermatitis Steps in Figure 1 number: 3,5,7,6,4 Applied rules: Identified parts: photo+dermat+itis Translated parts: foto+dermat+itis Translation: Fotodermatitis Figure 3: Terms obtained using generation-rules.",
        "3.",
        "Shallow Syntax.",
        "In the case that the input term does not appear in ItzulDB and it can not be generated by word-level rules (number 8 in the algorithm), chunk-level generation rules are used.",
        "Our hypothesis is that some chunks of the term will appear in ItzulDB with their translation.",
        "The application should generate the entire term using the translated components (see example in Figure 4).",
        "Input term: Deoxyribonucleic acid sample Steps in Figure 1 number: 8, 9, 10, 6, 4 Chunks in ItzulDB: 1st chunk: Deoxyribonucleic acid Basque: azido desoxirribonukleiko, ADN, DNA 2nd chunk: sample Basque: lagin Translation: Azido desoxirribonukleikoaren lagin, ADN lagin, DNA lagin Figure 4: Terms obtained using chunk-level generation rules.",
        "4.",
        "Machine Translation.",
        "In the last phase, our aim is to use a rule-based automatic translation system called Matxin (Mayor et al., 2011) that we want to adapt to the medical domain.",
        "Figure 5 shows an attempt of translation with the non adapted translator.",
        "For ex-ample, Matxin translates ?colon?",
        "as the punctuation mark (?bi puntu?",
        "or ?:?)",
        "because it lacks the anatomical meaning.",
        "Input term: Partial excision of oesophagus and interposition of colon Steps in Figure 1 number: 12, 4 Translation: Esofagoaren zati baten exci-siona eta interpositiona bi puntua Figure 5: Terms obtained using Matxin.",
        "The IHTSDO organization releases a semi-automatic mapping between SNOMED CT and the ICD-10.",
        "By identifying the sense of a concept in SNOMED CT, the best semantic space in the ICD-10 for this concept is searched obtaining linked codes.",
        "In this way we can obtain the corresponding Basque term for some of the SNOMED CT concepts through ICD-10.",
        "Considering that the structures of SNOMED CT and the ICD-10 are quite different, and that the mapping sometimes has ?mapping conditions?, the use of this 41 resource has been complex, but fruitful for very specialised terms.",
        "Although as we said this mapping is the unique source for obtaining very specialised terms, it should be used carefully as the objectives of SNOMED CT and ICD-10 are different.",
        "ICD-10 has classification purposes while SNOMED CT has representation purposes.",
        "A brief description of the first two phases of the algorithm is done in the next subsections (subsec- tions 4.1 and 4.2): 4.1 Phase 1: Lexical Resources The multilingual specialized dictionaries with English and Basque equivalences that have been used to enrich ItzulDB in the first phase of the algorithm are: ?",

        "?",
        "ICD-10 5 : This classification of diseases was translated into Basque in 1996.",
        "It is also available in English and in Spanish.",
        "The mapping between the different language editions conforming a little dictionary, allowed us to obtain 7,061 equivalences between English and Basque.",
        "?",

        "This general dictionary will help i) in the translation of not domain terms and ii) also in the translation of the chunks in Phase 3, and thus, on the generation of new terms in Basque.",
        "4.2 Phase 2: Finite State Transducers and Biomedical Affixes A first approach to this work is presented in (Perez-de-Vin?aspre et al., 2013).",
        "In that work, finite state transducers described in Foma (Hulden, 2009) are used to automatically identify the affixes in English Medical terms and by means of affix translation pairs, to generate the equivalent terms in Basque.",
        "We observed that the behavior of the roots in this type of words is similar to prefixes, so, we will not make distinction between them and we will name them prefixes.",
        "A list of 826 prefixes and 143 suffixes with medical meanings was manually translated.",
        "An evaluation of the system was performed in a Gold Standard of 885 English-Basque pairs.",
        "The Gold Standard was composed of the simple terms that were previously translated in the first phase of the algorithm.",
        "A precision of 93% and a recall of 41% were obtained.",
        "In that occasion, only SNOMED CT terms for which all the prefixes and suffixes were identified were translated.",
        "For example, terms with the pref-fix ?phat?",
        "were not translated as this affix does not appear in the prefixes and suffixes list.",
        "For instance, the ?hypophosphatemia?",
        "term was not translated even though the ?hypo?, ?phos?",
        "and ?emia?",
        "affixes were identified.",
        "We have improved this work by increasing the number of affixes and implementing transcription rules from English/Latin/Greek to Basque.",
        "Figure 6 will help us to get a wider view of the work exposed.",
        "The input term ?symphys- iolysis?",
        "is split into the possible affix combination in the first step (?sym+physio+lysis?",
