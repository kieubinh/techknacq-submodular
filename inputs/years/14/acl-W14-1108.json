        "Since the start of Human Genome Project in 1990, over 40 kinds of organism genome have been sequenced.",
        "Biological databases expand rapidly with the exponential growth of biological data.",
        "For instance, until now, over 260,000 named organisms have their nucleotide sequences in the GenBank (Benson et al. 2008) which integrates data from the major DNA and protein sequence.",
        "However, data is not information.",
        "Compared with situations before 2003, the key problem today has turned to methods of knowledge extraction.",
        "Understanding the role of genetics in diseases is one of the major goals of the post-genome era.",
        "The expanding rate of knowledge in gene?disease associations can hardly match up with the growth of biological data.",
        "It takes time before new discoveries are included in the databases such as Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), and most of the information represented in these databases is manually collected from literature.",
        "To address this challenge, we proposed an automatic gene-disease association extraction approach based on text mining and network analysis.",
        "We combine information filtering, grammar parsing and network analysis.",
        "We started by calculating main topics of each sentences in the corpus based on supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (sLDA) model (Blei and McAuliffe 2007).",
        "The most probable topics derived from sLDA model for each sentence are used as features for training maximum entropy (MaxEnt) (Manning and Schütze, 1999) classifier, which extracts sentences potentially containing information about gene-diseases interactions.",
        "After that, Probabilistic Context?",
        "Free Grammars (PCFGs) (Klein and Christopher 2003) is applied for sentence grammar parsing.",
        "Based on the syntactic tree of each sentence, we extract paths between specific entities such as diseases or genes.",
        "The network of all candidate genes and the disease is constituted by the interactions extracted from the sentences in the corpus.",
        "Our main hypothesis in network analysis is that the most important and the most central genes in an interaction network are most likely to be related to the disease.",
        "Last, network centrality metrics are used for calculating the importance of each gene.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 surveys related work.",
        "In Section 3, we introduce the proposed approach of extracting interactions from literature.",
        "Section 4 presents gene-disease interaction network analysis.",
        "And 54 then Section 5 presents and discusses the experimental results.",
        "Lastly we conclude this paper and discuss future work in Section 6.",
        "2 Related Work Much effort is currently spent on extracting gene?disease associations (?zg?r et al. 2008; Chun et al. 2006).",
        "Biomedical relation extraction techniques basically include two branches: interaction database based methods and text mining methods.",
        "Interaction database based methods rely on the availability of interaction databases, such as OMIM, MINT (Zanzoni et al. 2002), IntAct (Kerrien et al. 2012), BIND (Bader et al. 2003), which predict interactions between entities using sequence, structural, or evolutionary information (Krallinger, Leitner, and Valencia 2010).",
        "Although these databases host a large collection of manually extracted interactions from the literature, manually curated databases require considerable effort and time with the rapid increasing of biomedical literature.",
        "Since most biological facts are available in the free text of biomedical articles, the wealth of interaction information provided in biomedical articles motivated the implementation of text mining approaches to automatically extract biomedical relations.",
        "Text mining approaches to gene?disease association extraction have shown an evolution from simple systems that rely solely on co-occurrence statistics (Adamic et al. 2002; Al-Mubaid and Singh 2005) to complex systems utilizing natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms (Freudenberg and Propping 2002; Glenisson et al. 2004; ?zg?r et al. 2008).",
        "Well-known tools for discovering gene?disease associations include DAVID (Huang et al. 2009), GSEA (Subramanian et al. 2005), GOToolBox (Martin et al. 2004), rcNet (Huang et al. 2011) and many others.",
        "However, in many cases, since the existing annotations of disease-causative genes is far from complete (McKusick 2007), and a gene set might only contain a short list of poorly annotated genes, existing approaches often fail to reveal the associations between gene sets and disease phenotypes (Huang et al. 2011).",
        "Network-based approaches (Wuchty, Oltvai, and Barab?si, 2003; Schwikowski et al. 2000; Chen et al. 2006) is performed by assessing how much genes interact together and are close to known disease genes in protein networks.",
        "Relation extraction among genes is the fundamental step for gene-interaction network creation.",
        "Recently, syntactic analysis has been considered for relation extraction, and different parsing grammars have been applied.",
        "Temkin and Gilder (2003) used a full parser with a lexical analyzer and a context free grammar (CFG) to extract protein-protein interactions.",
        "In Yakushiji et al. (2005)'s work, they proposed a protein-protein interaction extraction system based on head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG).",
        "Although the pattern generation is complicated, the performance is not satisfactory.",
        "In addition, dependency grammar is used frequently in this domain.",
        "Erkan et al. (2007) proposed a semi-supervised classification for extracting protein interaction sentences using dependency parsing.",
        "Katrin et al. (2007) defined some rules based on dependency parse tree for relation extraction.",
        "The problem of those systems using dependency parse is that they cannot treat non-local dependencies, and thus rules acquired from the constructions are partial (Yakushiji et al. 2005).",
        "Differently, in this work, we apply sentence filtering based on topics and phrase structure parsing for relation extraction.",
        "The extracted sentences potentially contain information about gene-diseases interactions.",
        "Phrase structure grammars are based on the constituency relation, as opposed to the dependency relation associated with dependency grammars.",
        "Phrase structure parsing is full parsing, which takes into account the full sentence structure.",
        "In addition, many researches (Aerts et al. 2005; Chen et al. 2009; Ma et al. 2007; Hutz et al. 2008; Morrison et al. 2005; ?zg?r et al. 2008) used an initial list of seed genes to build a disease-specific gene-interaction network, and thus they are biased in favor of the seed genes, consequently the results also depend on the pickup seed genes.",
        "3 Extracting interactions from literature 3.1 The Corpus We used 44,064 articles from PubMed Central (PMC) Open Access which is a free full-text archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature.",
        "All articles were extracted by querying the keyword of ?breast cancer?.",

        "3.2.2 Topic model based on Gibbs Sampling Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was applied based on Gibbs Sampling method in our system.",
        "Compared with algorithm obtaining approximate maximum-likelihood estimates for topics-words distribution and the hyperparameters of the prior on documents-topics distribution given by Blei, Ng and Jordan (2002), Gibbs Sampling method doesn't need to explicitly represent the model parameters which effect on the final results (Griffiths, 2002).",
