        "Information retrieval (IR) aims at retrieving and ranking documents relative to a textual query expressing the information need of a user (Manning et al., 2008).",
        "IR has become a crucial technology for many organisations that deal with vast amounts of partly structured and unstructured (free text) data stored in electronic format, including hospitals and other health care providers.",
        "IR is an essential part of the clinical practice; e.g., on-line IR systems are associated with substantial improvements in clinicians decision-making concerning clinical problems (Westbrook et al., 2005).",
        "The different stages of the clinical care of a patient are documented in clinical care notes, consisting mainly of free text.",
        "A care episode consists of a sequence of individual clinical care notes, concluded by a discharge summary, as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Care episodes are stored in electronic format in electronic health record (EHR) systems.",
        "These systems are used throughout the health care sector by patients, administrators and professionals from different areas, primarily for clinical purposes, but also for secondary purposes such as decision support and research (H?ayrinen et al., 2008).",
        "IR from EHR in general is therefore a common and important task.",
        "This paper focuses on the particular task of retrieving those care episodes that are most similar to the sequence of clinical notes for a given pa-tient, which we will call care episode retrieval.",
        "In conventional IR, the query typically consists of several keywords or a short phrase, while the retrievable units are typically documents.",
        "In con-trast, in care episode retrieval, the query consist of the clinical notes contained in a care episode.",
        "The discharge summary is used separately for evalu-116 A BTime Clinical notes Dischargesummary Figure 1: Illustration of care episode retrieval.",
        "The two care episodes (A and B) are composed of a number of individual clinical notes and a single discharge summary.",
        "Given an ongoing care episode (minus the discharge summary), the task is to retrieve other, similar care episodes.",
        "ation purposes, and is assumed to be unavailable for constructing a query at retrieval time.",
        "Retrievable units are thus complete care episodes without summaries.",
        "We envision a number of different use cases for a care episode retrieval system.",
        "Firstly, it could facilitate clinicians in decision-making.",
        "For exam-ple, given a patient that is being treated in a hos-pital, an involved clinician may want to find previous patients that are similar in terms of their health history, symptoms or received treatments.",
        "Supplementary input from the clinician would enable the system to give heightened weight to keywords of particular interest within the care episodes, which would further be emphasized in the semantic similarity calculation during IR.",
        "It may help considerably to see what similar patients have received in terms of medication and further treatment, what related issues such as bi-conditions or risks oc-curred, how other clinicians have described certain aspects, what clinical practice guidelines have been utilized, and so on.",
        "This relates to the underlying principle in textual case-based reasoning (Lenz et al., 1998).",
        "Secondly, it could help management to get almost real time information concerning the overall situation on the unit for a specific follow-up period.",
        "Such a system could for example support managerial decision-making with statistical information concerning care trends on the unit, adverse events or infections.",
        "Thirdly, it could facilitate knowledge discovery and research.",
        "For instance, it could enable researchers to map or cluster similar care episodes to find common symptoms or conditions.",
        "In sum, care episode retrieval is likely to improve care quality and consistency in hospitals.",
        "From the perspective of NLP, care episode retrieval ?",
        "and IR from EHRs in general ?",
        "is a challenging task.",
        "It differs from general-purpose web search in that the vocabulary, the information needs and the queries of clinicians are highly specialised (Yang et al., 2011).",
        "Clinical notes contain highly domain-specific terminology (Rec- tor, 1999; Friedman et al., 2002; Allvin et al., 2010) and generic text processing resources are therefore often suboptimal or inadequate (Shatkay, 2005).",
        "At the same time, development of dedicated clinical NLP tools and resources is often difficult and costly.",
        "For example, popular data-driven approaches to NLP are based on supervised learn-ing, which requires substantial amounts of tailored training data, typically built through manual annotation by annotators who need both linguistic and clinical knowledge.",
        "Additionally, variations in the language and terminology used in sub-domains within and across health care organisations greatly limit the scope of applicability of such training data (Rector, 1999).",
        "Recent work has shown that distributional models of semantics, induced in an unsupervised manner from large corpora of clinical and/or medical text, are well suited as a resource-light approach to capturing and representing domain-specific terminology (Pedersen et al., 2007; Koopman et al., 2012; Henriksson et al., 2014).",
        "This raises the question to what extent distributional models of semantics can alleviate the aforementioned problems of NLP in the clinical domain.",
        "The work reported here investigates to what extent distributional models of semantics, built from a corpus of clinical text in an fully unsupervised manner, can be used for care episode retrieval.",
        "Models include several variants of random indexing and a semantic neural network model called word2vec, which will be described in more detail in Section 4.",
        "It has been argued that clinical NLP should exploit existing knowledge resources such as knowledge bases about medications, treatments, dis-eases, symptoms and care plans, despite these not having been explicitly built for doing clinical NLP (Friedman et al., 2013).",
        "Along these lines, a novel method is proposed here that utilizes the ICD-10 codes ?",
        "diagnostic labels attached to care episodes by clinicians ?",
        "to better induce domain-specificity in the semantic model.",
        "Experimental results suggest that this method outperforms a state-of-the art search engine (Lucene) on the task of care episode 117 retrieval.",
        "Apart from issues related to clinical terminol-ogy, another problem in care episode retrieval is the lack of benchmark data, such as the relevance scores produced by human judges commonly used for evaluation of IR systems.",
        "Although collections of care episodes may be available, producing gold standard similarity scores required for evaluation is costly.",
        "Another contribution of this paper is the proposal of evaluation procedures that circumvent the lack of human judgements regarding episode similarity.",
        "This is accomplished by exploiting either (1) ICD-10 codes of care episodes or (2) semantic similarity between their discharge summaries.",
        "Despite our focus on the specific task of care episode retrieval, we hypothesize that the methods and models proposed here have the potential to increase performance of IR on clinical text in general.",
        "2 Data The data set used in this study consists of the electronic health records from patients with any type of heart related problem that were admitted to one particular university hospital in Finland between the years 2005-2009.",
        "Of these, only the clinical notes written by physician are used.",
        "A supporting statement for the research was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Hospital District (17.2.2009 ?67) and permission to conduct the research was obtained from the Medical Director of the Hospital District (2/2009).",
        "The total set consist of 66884 care episodes, which amounts to 398040 notes and 64 million words in total.",
        "This full set was used for training of the semantic models.",
        "To make the experimentation more convenient, we chose to use a subset for evaluation.",
        "This comprises 26530 care episodes, amounting to 155562 notes and 25.7 million words in total.",
        "Notes are mostly unstructured, consisting of free text in Finnish.",
        "Some meta-data ?",
        "such as names of the authors, dates, wards, and so on ?",
        "is present, but is not used for retrieval.",
        "Care episodes have been manually labeled according to the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) (World Health Organization and others, 2013), a standardised tool of diagnostic codes for classifying diseases.",
        "Codes are normally applied at the end of the pa-tient's stay, or even after the patient has been discharged from the hospital.",
        "Care episodes have one primary ICD-10 code attached and optionally a number of additionally relevant codes.",
        "In this study, only the primary one is used, because extraction of the secondary codes is non-trivial.",
        "ICD-10 codes have an internal structure that reflects the classification system ranging from broad categories down to fine-grained subjects.",
        "For ex-ample, the first character (J) of the code J21.1 signals that it belongs to the broad category Diseases of the respiratory system.",
        "The next two digits (21) classify the subject as belonging to the subcategory Acute bronchiolitis.",
        "Finally, the last digit after the dot (1) means that it belongs to the sub-subclass Acute bronchiolitis due to human metapneumovirus.",
        "There are 356 unique ?pri- mary?",
        "ICD-10 codes in the evaluation data set.",
        "3 Task The task addressed in this study is retrieval of care episodes that are similar to each other.",
        "In contrast to the normal IR setting, where the search query is derived from a text stating the user's information need, here the query is based on another care episode, which we refer to as the query episode.",
        "As the query episode may document ongoing treatment, and thus lack a discharge summary and ICD-10 code, neither of these information sources can be relied upon for constructing the query.",
        "The task is therefore to retrieve the most similar care episodes using only the information contained in the free text of the clinical notes in the query episode.",
        "Evaluation of retrieval results generally requires an assessment of their relevancy to the query.",
        "Since similarity judgements by humans are currently lacking, and obtaining these is time-consuming and costly, we explored alternative ways of evaluating performance on the task.",
        "The first alternative is to assume that care episodes are similar if they have the same ICD-10 code.",
        "That is, a retrieved care episode is considered correct if its ICD-10 code is identical to the code of the query episode.",
        "It should be noted that ICD-10 codes are not used in the query in any of the experiments.",
        "Closer inspection shows that the free text content in care episodes with the same ICD-10 code is indeed quite similar in many cases, but not always.",
        "Considering all of them equally similar amounts to an arguably coarse approximation of relevance.",
        "The second alternative tries to remedy this issue by measuring the similarity between dis-118 charge summaries.",
        "That is, if the discharge summary of a retrieved episode is semantically similar to the discharge summary of the query episode, the retrieved episode is assumed to be correct.",
        "In practice, textual similarity between discharge summaries, and therefore the relevance score, is continuous rather than binary.",
        "It is measured using the same models of distributional semantics used for retrieval, which will be described in Section 4.",
        "It should be stressed that the discharge summaries are not taken into consideration during retrieval in any of the experiments and are only used for evaluation.",
        "4 Method 4.1 Semantic models A crucial part in retrieving similar care episodes is having a good similarity measure.",
        "Here similarity between care episodes is measured as the similarity between the words they contain (see Section 4.2).",
        "Semantic similarity between words is in turn measured through the use of word space models (WSM), without performing an explicit query expansion step.",
        "Several variants of these models were tested, utilizing different techniques and parameters for building them.",
        "The models trained and tested in this paper are: (1) classic random indexing with a sliding window using term index vectors and term context vectors (RI-Word); (2) random indexing with index vectors for documents (RI-Doc); (3) random indexing with index vectors for ICD-10 codes (RI-ICD); (4) a version of random indexing where only the term index vectors are used (RI-Index); and (5) a semantic neural network model, using word2vec to build word context vectors (Word2vec).",
        "RI-Word Random Indexing (RI) (Kanerva et al., 2000) is a method for building a (pre) compressed WSM with a fixed dimensionality, done in an incremental fashion.",
        "RI consist of the following two steps: First, instead of allocating one dimension in the multidimensional vector space to a single word, each word is assigned an ?index vector?",
        "as its unique signature in the vector space.",
        "Index vectors are generated vectors consisting of mostly zeros together with a randomly distributed set of several 1's and -1?s, uniquely distributed for each unique word; The second step is to induce ?context vec-tors?",
        "for each word.",
        "A context vector represents the contextual meaning of a word in the WSM.",
        "This is done using a sliding window of a fixed size to traverse a training corpus, inducing context vectors for the center/target word of the sliding window by summing the index vectors of the neighbouring words in the window.",
        "As the dimensionality of the index vectors is fixed, the dimensionality of the vector space will not grow beyond the size W ?Dim, where W is the number of unique words in the vocabulary, and Dim being the pre-selected dimensionality to use for the index vectors.",
        "As a result, RI models are significantly smaller than plain word space mod-els, making them a lot less computationally expensive.",
        "Additionally, the method is fully incremental (additional training data can be added at any given time without having to retrain the existing model), easy to parallelize, and scalable, meaning that it is fast and can be trained on large amounts of text in an on-line fashion.",
        "RI-Doc Contrary to sliding window approach used in RI-Word, a RI model built with document index vectors first assigns unique index vectors to every document in the training corpus.",
        "In the training phase, each word in a document get the respective document vector added to its context vector.",
        "The resulting WSM is thus a compressed version of a term-by-document matrix.",
        "RI-ICD Based on the principle of RI with document index vectors, we here explore a novel way of constructing a WSM by exploiting the ICD-10 code classification done by clinicians.",
        "Instead of using document index vectors, we here use ICD-code index vectors.",
        "First, a unique index vector is assigned to each chapter and sub-chapter in the ICD-10 taxonomy.",
        "This means assigning a unique index vector to each ?node?",
        "in the ICD-10 taxonomy, as illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "For each clinical note in the training corpus, the index vector of the their primary ICD-10 code is added to all words within it.",
        "In addition, all the index vectors for the ICD-codes higher in the taxonomy are added, each weighted according to their position in the hierarchy.",
        "A weight of 1 is given to the full code, while the weight is halved for each step upwards in the hierarchy.",
        "The motivation for the latter is to capture a certain degree of similarity between codes that share an initial path in the taxonomy.",
        "As a result, 119 J ?",

        "this similarity is encoded in the resulting WSM.",
        "As a example: for a clinical note labelled with the code J21.1, we add the following index vectors to the context vectors of all its constituting words: iv(J)?",
        "0.125, iv(J2)?",
        "0.25, iv(J21)?",
        "0.5 and iv(J21.1) ?",
        "1.0.",
        "The underlying hypothesis for building a WSM in this way is that it may capture relations between words in a way that better reflects the clinical domain, compared to the other domain-independent methods for constructing a WSM.",
        "RI-Index As an alternative to using word's (semantic) context vectors, we simply only use their index vectors as their ?contextual meaning?.",
        "When constructing document vectors directly from word index vectors (see Section 4.2), the resulting document vectors represent a compressed version of a document-by-term matrix.",
        "Word2vec Recently, a novel method for inducing WSMs was introduced by Mikolov et al. (2013a), stemming from the research in deep learning and neural network language models.",
        "While the overall objective of learning a continuous vector space representation for each word based on its textual context remains, the underlying algorithms are substantially different from traditional methods such as Latent Semantic Analysis and RI.",
        "Considering, in turn, every word in the training data as a target word, the method induces the representations by training a simplified neural network to predict the nearby context words of each target word (skip- gram architecture), or alternatively the target word based on all words in its immediate context (BoW architecture).",
        "The vector space representation is subsequently extracted from the learned weights within the neural network.",
        "One of the main practical advantages of the word2vec method lies in its scalability, allowing quick training on large amounts of text, setting it apart from the majority of other methods of distributional semantics.",
        "Ad-ditionally, the word2vec method has been shown to produce representations that surpass in quality traditional methods such as Latent Semantic Anal-ysis, especially on tasks measuring the preservation of important linguistic regularities (Mikolov et al., 2013b).",
        "4.2 Computing care episode similarity After having computed a WSM, the next step is to build episode vectors to use for the actual retrieval task.",
        "This is done by first normalizing the word vectors and multiplying them with a word's TF*IDF weight.",
        "An episode vector is then obtained by summing the word vectors of all its words and dividing the result by the total number of words in the episode.",
        "Similarity between episodes is determined by computing the cosine similarity between their vectors.",
        "4.3 Baselines Two baselines were used in this study.",
        "The first one is random retrieval of care episodes, which can be expected to give very low scores and serves merely as a sanity check.",
        "The second one is Apache Lucene (Cutting, 1999), a state-of-the-art search engine based on look-up of similar documents through a reverse index and relevance ranking based on a TF*IDF-weighted vector space model.",
        "Care episodes were indexed using Lucene.",
        "Similar to the other models/methods, all of the free text in the query episode, excluding the discharge summary, served as the query string provided to Lucene.",
        "Being a state-of-the-art IR system, the scores achieved by Lucene in these experiments should indicate the difficulty of the task.",
        "5 Experiments In these experiments we strove to have a setup that was as comparable as possible for all models and systems, both in terms of text pre-processing and in terms of the target model dimensionality when inducing the vector space models.",
        "The clin-120 ical notes are split into sentences, tokenized, and lemmatized using a Constraint-Grammar based morphological analyzer and tagger extended with clinical vocabulary (Karlsson, 1995).",
        "After stop words were removed 1 , the total training corpus contained 39 million words (minus the query episodes), while the evaluation subset contained 18.5 million words.",
        "The vocabulary consisted of 0.6 million unique terms.",
        "Twenty care episodes were randomly selected to serve as the query episodes during testing, with the requirement that each had different ICD-10 codes and consisted of a minimum of six clinical notes.",
        "The average number of words per query episode is 830.",
        "RI-based and word2vec models have a predefined dimensionality of 800.",
        "For RI-based mod-els, 4 non-zeros were used in the index vectors.",
        "For the RI-Word model, a narrow context window was employed (5 left + 5 right), weighting index vectors according to their distance to the target word (weight i = 2 1?dist it ).",
        "In addition, the index vectors were shifted once left or right depending on what side of the target word they were located, similar to direction vectors as described in (Sahlgren et al., 2008) These parameters for RI were chosen based on previous work on semantic textual similarity (Moen et al., 2013).",
        "Also a much larger window of 20+20 was tested, but without noteworthy improvements.",
        "The word2vec model is trained with the BoW architecture and otherwise default parameters.",
        "In addition to Apache Lucene (version 4.2.0) 2 , the word2vec tool 3 was used to train the word2vec model, and the RI-based methods utilized the JavaSDM package 4 .",
        "Scores were calculated using the trec eval tool 5 .",
        "5.1 Experiment 1: ICD-10 code overlap In this experiment retrieved episodes with a primary ICD-10 code identical to that of the query episode were considered to be correct.",

        "The total is 7721, and the average is 386.",

        "Using the discharge summaries of the query episodes, the top 100 care episodes with the most similar discharge summary were selected as the most similar care episodes (disregarding the query episode).",
        "This was repeated for each of the methods ?",
        "i.e. the five different semantic models and Lucene ?",
        "resulting in six different tests.",
        "The top 100 was used rather than a threshold on the similarity score, because otherwise six different thresholds would have to be chosen.",
        "This procedure thus resulted in six different test collections, each consisting of 20 query episodes with their corresponding 100 most similar collection episodes.",
        "Subsequently a 6-by-6 experimental design was followed where each retrieval method was tested against each test set construction method.",
        "At retrieval time, for each query episode, the system retrieves and ranks 1000 care episodes.",
        "It can be expected that when identical methods are used for re-121 trieval and test set construction, the resulting bias gives rise to relatively high scores.",
        "In contrast, averaging over the scores for all six construction methods is assumed to be a less biased indicator of performance.",
        "Table 2 shows the number of correctly retrieved episodes by the different models, with the maximum being 2000 (20 queries times 100 most similar episodes).",
        "This gives an indication of the recall among a 1000 retrieved episodes per query, but without caring about precision or ranking.",
        "In general, the numbers are relatively good when the same model is used for both retrieval and construction of the test set (cf. values on the diagonal), although in a couple of cases (e.g. with word2vec) results are better with different models.",
        "The RI-ICD model performs best when used for both retrieval and test construction.",
        "Looking at the av-erages, which presumably are less biased indica-tors, RI-ICD and word2vec seem to have comparable performance, with both of them outperforming Lucene.",
        "Other models are less successful, although still much better than the random baseline.",
        "The MAP scores in Table 3 show similar re-sults, although here RI-ICD yields the best average score.",
        "Both models RI-ICD and word2vec outperform Lucene.",
        "Again the RI-ICD model performs exceptionally well when used for both retrieval and test construction.",
        "Finally Table 4 presents precision for top-10 retrieved care episodes.",
        "Here RI-Doc yields the best average scores, while RI-ICD and word2vec both perform slightly worse.",
        "6 Discussion The goal of the experiments was primarily to determine which distributional semantic models work best for care episode retrieval.",
        "The experimental results show that several models outperform Lucene at the care episode retrieval task.",
        "This suggests that models of higher order semantics contribute positively to calculating document similarities in the clinical domain, compared with straight forward boolean word matching (cf. RI-Index and Lucene).",
        "The relatively good performance of the RI-ICD model, particularly in Experiment 1, suggests that exploiting structured or encoded information in building semantic models for clinical NLP is a promising direction that calls for further investigation.",
        "This approach concurs with the arguments in favor of reuse of existing information sources in Friedman et al. (2013).",
        "On the one hand, it may not be surprising that the RI-ICD model is performing well on Experiment 1, given how it induces semantic relations between words occurring in episodes with the same ICD-10 code.",
        "On the other hand, being able to accurately retrieve care episodes with similar ICD-10 codes evidently has practical value from a clinical perspective.",
        "The different ranking of models in experiments 1 versus 2 confirms that there is a difference between the two indicators of episode similarity, i.e. similarity in terms of their ICD-10 codes versus similarity with regard to their discharge summaries.",
        "In our data a single care episode can potentially span across several hospital wards.",
        "A better correlation between the similarity measures is to be expected when narrowing the definition of a care episode to only a single ward.",
        "Also, taking into consideration all ICD-10 codes for care episodes ?",
        "not only the primary one ?",
        "could potentially improve discrimination among care episodes.",
        "This could be useful in two ways: (1) to create more precise test sets of the type used in Experiment 1; (2) to extend RI-ICD models with index vectors also for the secondary ICD-10 codes.",
        "Input to the models for training was limited to the free text in the clinical notes, with the exception of the use of ICD-10 codes in the RI-ICD model.",
        "Other sources of information could, and probably should, be utilized in a practical care episode retrieval system applied in a hospi-tal, such as the structured and coded information commonly found in EHR systems.",
        "Another potential information source is the internal structure of the care episodes, as episodes containing similar notes in the same sequential order are intuitively more likely to be similar.",
        "We tried computing exhaustive pairwise similarities between the individual notes from two episodes and then taking the average of these as a similarity measure for the episodes.",
        "However, this did not improve performance on any measure.",
        "An alternative approach may be to apply sequence alignment algo-rithms, as commonly used in bioinformatics (Gus- field, 1997), in order to detect if both episodes contain similar notes in the same temporal order.",
        "We leave this to future work.",

        "As manually constructing a proper test set of classified care episodes is costly, we experimented with building test sets by exploiting either ICD-10 code overlap or semantic similarity of discharge summaries.",
        "A novel method for generating semantic models utilizing the ICD-10 codes of care episodes in the training corpus was presented (RI- ICD).",
        "The models, as well as the Lucene search engine, were applied to the care episode retrieval task and their performance was evaluated against the test sets using different evaluation measures.",
        "The results suggest that the RI-ICD model is better suited to IR tasks in the clinical domain compared with models trained on local distributions of words, or those relying on direct word matching.",
