        "Lexically and syntactically complex sentences can be difficult to understand for non-native speakers (Petersen and Ostendorf, 2007; Alu?",
        "?sio et al., 2008b), and for people with language impair-ments, e.g. people diagnosed with aphasia (Car- roll et al., 1999; Devlin, 1999), autism spectrum disorder ( ?",

        "At the same time, long and complex sentences are also a stumbling block for many NLP tasks and applications such as parsing, machine translation, information retrieval, and summarisation (Chandrasekar et al., 1996).",
        "This justifies the need for Text Simplification (TS) systems which would convert such sentences into their simpler and easier-to-read variants, while at the same time preserving the original meaning.",
        "So far, TS systems have been developed for English (Siddharthan, 2006; Zhu et al., 2010; Woodsend and Lapata, 2011a; Coster and Kauchak, 2011; Wubben et al., 2012), Spanish (Saggion et al., 2011), and Portuguese (Alu?",

        "Usually, TS systems are either evaluated for: (1) the quality of the generated output, or (2) the effec-tiveness/usefulness of such simplification on reading speed and comprehension of the target population.",
        "For the purpose of this study we focused only on the former.",
        "The quality of the output generated by TS systems is commonly evaluated by using a combination of readability metrics (measuring the degree of simplification) and human assessment (measuring the grammaticality and meaning preservation).",
        "Despite the noticeable similarity between evaluation of the fluency and adequacy of a machine translation (MT) output, and evaluation of grammaticality and meaning preservation of a TS system output, there have been no works exploring whether any of the MT evaluation metrics are well correlated with the latter, and could thus replace the time-consuming human assessment.",
        "The contributions of the present work are the following: ?",
        "It is the first study to explore the possibility of replacing human assessment of the quality of TS system output with automatic evaluation.",

        "?",
        "It proposes a decision-making procedure for the classification of simplified sentences into: (1) those which are acceptable; (2) those which need further post-editing; and (3) those which should be discarded.",
        "1 2 Related Work The output of the TS system proposed by Siddharthan (2006) was rated for grammaticality and meaning preservation by three human evaluators.",
        "Similarly, Drndarevic et al. (2013) evaluated the grammaticality and the meaning preservation of automatically simplified Spanish sentences on a Likert scale with the help of twenty-five human annotators.",
        "Additionally, the authors used seven readability metrics to assess the degree of simplification.",

        "In this case, the quality of the output generated by the system was evaluated using several standard MT evaluation met-rics: BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), NIST (Dod- dington, 2002), and TERp (Snover et al., 2009).",
        "3 Methodology All experiments were conducted on a freely available sentence-level dataset 1 , fully described in (Glava's and ?",

        "3.1 Original dataset The dataset contains 280 pairs of original sentences and their corresponding simplified versions annotated by humans for grammaticality, meaning preservation, and simplicity of the simplified version.",
        "We used all sentence pairs, focusing only on four out of eight available features: (1) the original text, (2) the simplified text, (3) the grammaticality score, and (4) the score for meaning preservation.",

        "Stajner, 2013) The simplified versions of original sentences were obtained by using four different simplification methods: baseline, sentence-wise, event-wise, and pronominal anaphora.",
        "The baseline retains only the main clause of a sentence, and discards all subordinate clauses, based on the output of the Stanford constituency parser (Klein and Manning, 2003).",
        "Sentence-wise simplification eliminates all those tokens in the original sentence that do not belong to any of the extracted factual event mentions, while the event-wise simplification transforms each factual event mention into a separate sentence of the output.",
        "The last simplification scheme (pronominal anaphora) additionally employs pronominal anaphora resolution on top of the event-wise simplification scheme.",
        "3 3.2 Human Assessment Human assessors were asked to score the given sentence pairs (or text snippets in the case of split sentences) on a 1?3 scale based on three crite-ria: Grammaticality (1 ?",

        "First, simplicity was defined as the amount of irrelevant information which was eliminated.",

        "?number of deletions?.",
        "However, none of the two demonstrated any significant correlation with the simplicity score, and those results are thus not reported in this paper).",
        "Second, the output sentences with a low simplicity score are not as detrimental for the TS system as those with a low grammaticality or meaning preservation score.",
        "The sentences with a low simplicity score would simply not help the target user read faster or understand better, but would not do any harm either.",
        "Alter-natively, if the target ?user?",
        "is an MT or information extraction (IE) system, or a parser for ex-ample, such sentences would not lower the performance of the system; they would just not improve it.",
        "Low scores for G and M, however, would lead to a worse performance for such NLP systems, longer reading time, and a worse or erroneous understanding of the text.",
        "Third, the simplicity of the output (or complexity reduction performed by a TS system) could be evaluated separately, in a fully automatic manner ?",
        "using some readability measures or average sentence length as features (as in (Drndarevi?c et al., 2013; Glava's and ?",
        "Stajner, 4 2013) for example).",
        "3.4 Features: MT Evaluation Metrics In all experiments, we focused on six commonly used MT evaluation metrics.",
        "These are cosine similarity (using the bag-of-words representation), METEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2011), TERp (Snover et al., 2009), TINE (Rios et al., 2011), and two components of TINE: T-BLEU (which differs from the standard BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) by using 3-grams, 2-grams, and 1-grams when there are no 4-grams found, where the ?original?",
        "BLEU would give score ?0?)",
        "and SRL (which is the component of TINE based on semantic role labeling using SENNA 4 ).",
        "Although these two components contribute equally to TINE (thus being linearly correlated with TINE), we wanted to investigate which one of them contributes more to the correlation of TINE with human judgements.",
        "Given their different natures, we expect T-BLEU to contribute more to the correlation of TINE with human judgements of grammaticality, and SRL to contribute more to the correlation of TINE with human judgements of meaning preservation.",
        "As we do not have the reference for the simplified sentence, all metrics are applied in a slightly different way than in MT.",
        "Instead of evaluating the translation hypothesis (output of the automatic TS system in our case) with the corresponding reference translation (which would be a ?gold stan-dard?",
        "simplified sentence), we apply the metrics to the output of the automatic TS system comparing it with the corresponding original sentence.",
        "Given that the simplified sentences in the used dataset are usually shorter than the original ones (due to the elimination of irrelevant content which was the main focus of the TS system proposed by Glava's and ?",
        "Stajner (2013)), we expect low scores of T-BLEU and METEOR which apply a brevity penalty.",
        "However, our dataset does not contain any kind of lexical simplification, but rather copies all relevant information from the original sentence 5 .",
        "Therefore, we expect the exact matches of word forms and semantic role labels (which are components of the MT evaluation metrics) to have a good correlation to human judgements of grammaticality and meaning preservation.",
        "4 http://ml.nec-labs.com/senna/ 5 The exceptions being changes of gerundive forms into past tense, and anaphoric pronoun resolution in some simplification schemes.",
        "See Section 3.1 and (Glava's and ?",
        "Stajner, 2013) for more details.",
        "3.5 Goal After we obtained the six automatic metrics (co- sine, METEOR, TERp, TINE, T-BLEU, and SRL), we performed two sets of experiments, trying to answer two main questions: 1.",
        "Are the chosen MT evaluation metrics correlated with the human judgements of grammaticality and meaning preservation of the TS system output?",
        "2.",
        "Could we automatically classify the simplified sentences into those which are: (1) cor-rect, (2) require a minimal post-editing, (3) incorrect and need to be discarded?",
        "A positive answer to the first question would mean that there is a possibility of finding an automatic metric (or a combination of several automatic metrics) which could successfully replace the time consuming human evaluation.",
        "The search for that ?ideal?",
        "combination of automatic metrics could be performed by using various classification algorithms and carefully designed features.",
        "If we manage to classify simplified sentences into the three aforementioned categories with a satisfying accuracy, the benefits would be two-fold.",
        "Firstly, such a classification system could be used for an automatic evaluation of TS systems and an easy comparison of their performances.",
        "Secondly, it could be used inside a TS system to mark those sentences of low quality which need to be checked further, or those sentences whose original meaning changed significantly.",
        "The latter could then be left in their original form or simplified using some different technique.",

        "On the other hand, the dataset used contains a significant content reduction in most of the sentences.",
        "If the same experiments were conducted on a dataset which performs only syntactic simplification, we would expect much higher correlation of MT evaluation metrics to human judgements, due to the lesser impact of the brevity penalty in that case.",
        "If we were to apply the same MT evaluation metrics to a TS system which additionally performs some kind of lexical simplification (either a simple lexical substitution or paraphrasing), the correlation results for T-BLEU and cosine similarity would be lower (due to the lower number of exact matches), but not for METEOR, TERp and SRL (and thus TINE as well).",
        "As a similar problem is also present in the evaluation of MT systems where the obtained output could differ from the reference translation (while still being equally good), METEOR, TERp, and SRL in TINE additionally use inexact matching.",
        "The first two use the stem, synonym, and paraphrase matches, while SRL uses ontologies and thesaurus.",
        "6 Conclusions and Future Work While the results reported are preliminary and their universality needs to be validated on different TS datasets, the experiments and results presented can be regarded as a promising step towards an automatic assessment of grammaticality and meaning preservation for the output of TS systems.",
        "In addition and to the best of our knowledge, there are no such datasets publicly available other than the one used.",
        "Nevertheless, we hope that these results would initiate an interesting discussion in the TS community and start a new direction of studies towards automatic evaluation of text simplification systems.",
