        "Clear language is important to ensure efficiency in communication and eliminate risks of misunderstanding.",
        "With written text, this clarity is measured by readability.",
        "In the last years, we have witnessed an increasing amount work towards improving text readability.",
        "In general, these efforts focus on making general text easier to understand to non-native speakers and people with special needs, poor literacy, aphasia, dyslexia, or other language deficits.",
        "In this paper, we address making technical text more readable to laypeople, defined as those without professional or specialised knowledge in a given field.",
        "Technical documentation as scientific papers or legal contracts are two genres of written text that are difficult to understand (Alberts et al., 2011).",
        "An extreme example that takes the worst from both these worlds is the claim section of patent documents: it defines the boundaries of the legal protection of the invention by describing complex technical issues and using specific legal jargon (Pressman, 2006).",
        "Moreover, due to international conventions, each patent claim must be written into a single sentence.",
        "This leads to very long sentences with complex syntactic structures that are hard to read and comprehend not only for laypeople but also for technical people who are not trained to read patent claims.",
        "As an example of other efforts with similar goals to improve the readability of technical text to laypeople, we mention the CLEF eHealth shared tasks in 2013 and 2014 (Suominen et al., 2013).",
        "However, instead of inventors, researchers, and other claim readers, they target patients and their next-of-kins by developing and evaluating technologies to improve the readability of clinical reports and help them in finding further information related to their condition in the Internet.",
        "Some proposals have also been made in order to improve claim readability, for example, by applying simplification, paraphrasing, and summarisation methods (see Section 2).",
        "However, these approaches modify the claim content.",
        "This increases 66 the risk of changing also the meaning, which is not desirable in the context of patent claims and other legal documents.",
        "In this paper, we propose an alternative method that focuses on clarifying the presentation of the claim content rather than its modification.",
        "Since readability strongly affects text comprehension (Inui et al., 2003), the aim of this study is to make the content of the patent claims more legible and consequently make them easier to comprehend.",
        "As the first steps towards this improved presentation of the patent claims, we propose to segment the original text.",
        "Our approach is data driven and we perform the segmentation at two levels: first, an entire claim is segmented into three components (i.e., preamble, transition, and body text) and second, the components are further segmented into clauses.",
        "At the first level, we use a rule-based method and at the second level, we apply a conditional random field.",
        "We evaluate segmentation performance statistically at both levels and in addition, we analyse errors in clause segmentation qualitatively; because our performance at the first level is almost perfect (i.e., for detecting the beginning and end of the preamble, the accuracy percentages are 100 and 97 and these numbers are 94 and 100 for the transition and 100 and 100 for the body text), we focus on the errors at the second level alone.",
        "In com-parison, we have the precision of 77 per cent and recall of 76 per cent in clause segmentation.",
        "Even though this performance at the second level is not perfect, it is significantly better than the respective percentages of 41 and 29 (0.2 and 0.3) for a baseline based on both punctuation and keywords (punctuation only).",
        "The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 describes as background information of this study includes an explanation about what patent claims are, how to read them, and what kind of related work exists on claim readability.",
        "Section 3 outlines our materials and methods.",
        "Section 4 presents the experiments results and discussion.",
        "Finally, conclusions and ideas for future work are presented in Section 5.",
        "2 Background 2.1 Patent claims Patent documents have a predefined document structure that consists of several sections, such as the title, abstract, background of the invention, de-[Toolholder] p , [comprising] t [a holder body with an insert site at its forward end comprising a bottom surface and at least one side wall where there projects a pin from said bottom surface upon which there is located an insert having a central bore, a clamping wedge for wedging engagement between a support surface of the holder and an adjacent edge surface of said insert and an actuating screw received in said wedge whilst threadably engaged in a bore of said holder, said support surface and said edge surface are at least partially converging downwards said wedge clamp having distantly provided protrusions for abutment against the top face and the edge surface of said insert, characterised in that the wedge consists of a pair of distantly provided first protrusions for abutment against a top face of the insert, and a pair of distantly provided second protrusions for abutment against an adjacent edge surface] b .",
        "Figure 1: An example patent claim.",
        "We have used brackets to illustrate claim components and the sub-scripts p, t, and b correspond to the preamble, transition, and body text, respectively.",
        "scription of the drawings, and claims.",
        "As already mentioned, the claims can be seen as the most important section as they define the scope of legal protection of the invention.",
        "In most modern patent laws, patent applications must have at least one claim (Pressman, 2006).",
        "The claims are written into a single sentence because of international conventions.",
        "Figure 1 provides an example claim.",
        "Furthermore, a claim should be composed by, at least, the following parts, 1.",
        "Preamble is an introduction, which describes the class of the invention.",
        "2.",
        "Transition is a phrase or linking word that relates the preamble with the rest of the claim.",
        "The expressions comprising, containing, in-cluding, consisting of, wherein and characterise in that are the most common transitions.",
        "3.",
        "Body text describes the invention and recites its limitations.",
        "We have also included an illustration of these claim components in Figure 1.",
        "Because a claim is a single sentence, special punctuation conventions have been developed and are being used by patent writers.",
        "Modern claims follow a format where the preamble is separated 67 Table 1: Per claim demographics Training set Test set # tokens mean 60 66 min 7 8 max 440 502 # boundaries mean 5 5 min 1 1 max 53 41 from the transition by a comma, the transition from the body text by a colon, and each invention element in the body text by a semicolon (Radack, 1995).",
        "Other specifications regarding punctuation are the following text elaboration and element combination conventions: A claim should contain a period only in the end.",
        "A comma should be used in all natural pauses.",
        "The serial comma 1 should be used to separate the elements of a list.",
        "- Dashes, quotes, parentheses, and abbreviations should be avoided.",
        "Because a claim takes the form of a single sen-tence, long sentences are common.",
        "Meanwhile, in the general discourse (e.g., news articles) sentences are composed of twenty to thirty words, claim sentences with over a hundred words are very frequent (see, e.g., Table 1 related to materials used in this paper).",
        "As a consequence, claims usually contain several subordinate and coordinate clauses, as they enable the aforementioned elaboration and the combination of elements of equal importance, respectively.",
        "As claims are difficult to read and interpret, several books and tutorials suggest how claims should be read (Radack, 1995; Pressman, 2006).",
        "The first step towards reading a claim is to identify its components (i.e., preamble, transition, and body text).",
        "Another suggestion is to identify and highlight the different elements of the invention spelled out in the body text of the claims.",
        "1 The serial comma (also known as the Oxford comma) is the comma used mediately before a coordination conjunction (e.g., CDs, DVDs, and magnetic tapes where the last comma indicates that DVDs and magnetic tapes are not mixed).",
        "http://oxforddictionaries.com (ac- cessed 28 Feb, 2014) The clear punctuation marks and lexical markers enable the claim component segmentation, as suggested above.",
        "Moreover, the predominance of intra-sentential syntactic structures (e.g., subordinate and coordinate constructions) favours segmenting patent claims into clauses.",
        "These clauses can then be presented as a sequence of segments which is likely to improve claim readability.",
        "2.2 Related work So far, not many studies have addressed the problem of improving the readability of patents claims.",
        "In particular, to the best of our knowledge, there is no research that specifically targets the problem of presenting the claims in a more readable layout.",
        "Consequently, we focus on efforts devoted to claim readability in general with an emphasis on text segmentation.",
        "We begin by discussing three studies that address text simplification in patent claims.",
        "Note that these approaches modify the claim content which may also change their meaning.",
        "This is riskier in the context of patent documents and other legal text than our approach of clarifying the presentation.",
        "Moreover, in order achieve a reasonable performance, the methods of these studies require sophisticated tools for discourse analysis and syntactic parsing.",
        "Usually these tools also need to be tailored to the genre of claim text.",
        "First, a parsing methodology to simplify sentences in US patent documents has been proposed (Sheremetyeva, 2003).",
        "The resulting analysis structure is a syntactic dependency tree and the simplified sentences are generated based on the intermediate chunking structure of the parser.",
        "How-ever, neither the tools used to simplify sentences nor the resulting improvement in readability has been formally measured.",
        "Second, simplification of Japanese claim sentences has been addressed through a rule-based method (Shinmori et al., 2003).",
        "It identifies the discourse structure of a claim using cue phrases and lexico-syntactic patterns.",
        "Then it paraphrases each discourse segment.",
        "Third, a claim simplification method to paraphrase and summarise text has been introduced (Bouayad-Agha et al., 2009).",
        "It is multilingual and consists of claim segmentation, corefer-ence resolution, and discourse tree derivation.",
        "In claim segmentation, a rule-based system is compared to machine learning with the conclusion of 68 the former approach outperforming the latter.",
        "The machine learning approach is, however, very similar to the clause segmentation task described in this paper.",
        "They differ in the features used to characterized the clause boundaries and in evaluation.",
        "For the evaluation, these authors use the cosine similarity to calculate a 1:1 term overlap between the automated solution and gold standard set whereas we assess whether a token is an accurate segment boundary or not.",
        "We continue by discussing a complementary method to our approach of improving the readability of claims through their clearer presentation without modifying the text itself.",
        "This work by Shinmori et al. (2012) is inspired by the fact that claims must be understood in the light of the definitions provided in the description section of the patents.",
        "It aims to enrich the content by aligning claim phrases with relevant text from the description section.",
        "For the evaluation, the authors have inspected 38 patent documents.",
        "The automated method generates 35 alignments for these documents (i.e., twenty correct and fifteen false) and misses only six.",
        "It would be interesting to test if this alignment method and the claim segmentation proposed in this paper complement each other.",
        "We end by noting that the task of segmenting claim phrases is similar to the task of detecting phrase boundaries by Sang and D?ejean (2001) in the sense that the segments we want to identify are intra-sentential.",
        "However, the peculiar syntactic style of claims makes the phrase detection strategies not applicable (see Ferraro (2012) for a detailed study on the linguistic idiosyncrasy of patent claims).",
        "3 Materials and methods In this paper, we performed statistical experiments and qualitative error analyses related to two segmentation tasks (see Figure 2): 1.",
        "Segmenting claims section to the components for preamble, transition, and body text.",
        "2.",
        "Segmenting each claim to subordinate and coordinate clauses.",
        "For Task 1, we developed a rule-based method using the General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) (Cunningham et al., 2011).",
        "The system had three rules, one for each of the claim parts we were interested in identifying.",
        "The rules were Table 2: Dataset demographics # claims # segments # words Training set 811 4397 48939 Development set 10 15 260 Test set 80 491 5517 written in terms of JAPE grammars.",
        "2 In order to process the rules, the GATE pipeline illustrated in Figure 3 was applied.",
        "Because transitions should match with the first instance of a closed set of keywords (we used comprise, consist, wherein, char-acterize, include, have, and contain), our first rule identified a transition and, using its boundary in-dices, we restricted the application of our further rules.",
        "This resulted in the following application order: transition ??",
        "preamble ??",
        "body text.",
        "Our two other rules relied on lexico-syntactic patterns and punctuation marks.",
        "Note that even though punctuation conventions have been developed for claim writing (see Section 2.1), their following is not mandatory.",
        "This led us to experiment these more complex rules.",
        "The first task was applied to the complete dataset (training, develop-ment, and test sets merged into one single dataset) described in Table 2.",
        "For Task 2, our method was based on supervised machine learning (ML).",
        "To train this ML classi-fier, we used a patent claim corpus annotated with clause boundaries.",
        "This corpus was provided by the TALN Research Group from Universitat Pompeu Fabra.",
        "The aim of the segmentation classifier was to decide whether a claim token is a segment boundary or not, given a context.",
        "Thus, every token was seen as a candidate for placing a segment boundary.",
        "Following standard ML traditions, we split the dataset in training, development, and test sets (Tables 2 and 1).",
        "The corpus was analysed with a transitional 3 version of Bohnet's parser (Bohnet and Kuhn, 2012).",
        "It was one of the best parsers in the CoNLL Shared Task 2009 (Haji?c et al., 2009).",
        "2 JAPE, a component of GATE, is a finite state transducer that operates over annotations based on regular expressions.",
        "3 Patent claim sentences can be very long which implies long-distance dependencies.",
        "Therefore, transition-based parsers, which typically have a linear or quadratic complexity (Nivre and Nilsson, 2004; Attardi, 2006), are better suited for parsing patent sentences than graph-based parsers, which usually have a cubic complexity.",

        "Noun Phrase Chunker ??",
        "JAPE Figure 3: GATE pipeline for Task 1 In order to characterise the clause boundaries, the following features were used for each token in the corpus: lemma of the current token, part-of-speech (POS) tag 4 of the current token as well as POS-tags of the two immediately preceding and two immediately subsequent words, syntactic head and dependent of the current token, and syntactic dependency relation between the current token and its head and dependent tokens.",
        "Moreover, the fifteen most frequent lemmas and five most frequent POS-tags and punctuation marks were used as features we called segmentation keywords (Table 3).",
        "For classification we used the CRF++ toolkit, an open source implementation of conditional random fields (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "This framework for building probabilistic graphical models to segment and label sequence data has been successfully applied to solve chunking (Sha and Pereira, 4 The POS-tag corresponds to the Peen Tree Bank tag set (Marcus et al., 1993) whereas IN = preposition or conjunc-tion, subordinating; CC = Coordinating Conjunction; VBN = Verb, past participle; VBG = verb, gerund or present partici-ple; WRB = Wh-adverb.",

        "Due to the lack of a corpus annotated with claims components, we selected twenty claims randomly and performed the annotation ourselves (i.e., one of the authors annotated the claims).",
        "The annotator was asked to assess whether the beginning and ending of a claim component was successfully identified.",
        "Performance in Task 2 was evaluated using the precision, recall, and F-score on the test set.",
        "We considered that clause segmentation is a precision oriented task, meaning that we emphasised the demand for a high precision at the expense of a possibly more modest recall.",
        "In order to better understand errors in clause segmentation, we analysed errors qualitatively using content analysis (Stemler, 2001).",
        "This method is commonly used in evaluation of language technologies.",

        "That is, the resulting segmentation was almost perfect.",
        "This was not surprising since we were processing simple and well defined types of segments.",
        "How-ever, there was a small mismatch in the boundary identification for the preamble and the transition segments.",
        "Our ML method clearly outperformed both its baselines in Task 2 (Table 5).",
        "It had the precision of 77 per cent and recall of 76 per cent in clause segmentation.",
        "The respective percentages were 41 and 29 for the baseline based on both punctuation and keywords.",

        "Segmentation errors caused by ambiguous coordinating conjunctions were due to the fact that not all of them were used as segment delimiters.",
        "Let us illustrate this with the following automatically segmented claim fragment with two coordinating conjunctions (a segment is a string between square brackets, the integer sub-script indicating the segment number, and the conjunctions in italics): .",

        "In this example, the two conjunctions were considered as segment delimiters which resulted in an incorrect segmentation.",
        "The correct analysis would have been to maintain the fragment as a single segment since simple noun phrases are not annotated as individual segments in our corpus.",
        "Segmentation errors due to consecutive segmentation keywords resulted in undesirable segments only once in our set of fifty cases.",
        "This happened because the classifier segmented every encounter with a segmentation keyword, even when the keywords were consecutive.",

        "We have proposed a method that focuses on presenting the claims in a clearer way rather than modifying their text content.",
        "This claim clarity is an important characteristic for inventors, researchers, and other laypeople.",
        "It may also be useful for patent experts, because clear clauses may help them to avoid future legal cost due to litigations.",
        "Moreover, better capabilities to understand patent documents contribute to democratisation of the invention and, therefore, to human knowledge.",
        "For future work, we plan to conduct a user-centered evaluation study on claim readability.",
        "We wish to ask laypeople and patents experts to assess the usability and usefulness of our approach.",
        "Furthermore, we plan to consider text highlight-ing, terminology linking to definitions, and other content enrichment functionalities as ways of improving claim readability.",
