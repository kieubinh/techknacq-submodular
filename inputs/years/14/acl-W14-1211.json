        "Abbreviations are prevalent in text, especially in certain text types where the author has either limited space or time to write the written message and therefore shortens some words or phrases.",
        "This might, however, make it difficult for the reader to understand the meaning of the actual abbreviation.",
        "Although some abbreviations are well-known, and frequently used by most of us (e.g., i.e., pm, etc.",
        "), most of the abbreviations used in specialized domains are often less known to the public.",
        "Interpreting them is not an easy task, as abbreviations are often ambiguous and their correct meaning depends on the context in which they appear.",
        "For example, military and governmental staff would naturally read EACL as Emergency Action Checklist, people in the food and beverage business might think of the company name EACL, linguists would probably interpret it as the European Chapter of Chinese Linguistics, while computational linguists would generally claim that EACL stands for the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics.",
        "However, the readers of this particular article know, as the title suggests, that the intended meaning here is the Expansion of Abbreviations in CLinical text.",
        "It has been shown that abbreviations are frequently occurring in various domains and genres, such as in historical documents, messages in social media, as well as in different registers used by specialists within a particular field of expertise.",
        "Clinical texts produced by health care personnel is an example of the latter.",
        "The clinical texts are communication artifacts, and the clinical setting requires that information is expressed in an efficient way, resulting in short telegraphic messages.",
        "Physicians and nurses need to document their work to describe findings, treatments and procedures precisely and compactly, often under time pressure.",
        "In recent years, governments and health care actors have started making electronic health records accessible, not only to other caretakers, but also to patients in order to enable them to participate actively in their own health care processes.",
        "How-ever, several studies have shown that patients have difficulties to comprehend their own health care reports and other medical texts due to the different linguistic features that characterize these, aswell as to medical jargon and technical terminology (Elhadad, 2006; Rudd et al., 1999; Keselman et al., 2007).",
        "It has also been shown that physicians rarely adapt their writing style in order to produce documents that are accessible to lay readers (Al- lvin, 2010).",
        "Besides the use of different terminologies and technical terms, an important obstacle for patients to comprehend medical texts is the frequent use of ?",
        "for the patients unknown ?",
        "ab-94 breviations (Keselman et al., 2007; Adnan et al., 2010).",
        "In health records, abbreviations, which constitute linguistic units that are inherently difficult to decode, are commonly used and often non standard (Skeppstedt, 2012).",
        "An important step in order to increase readability for lay readers is to translate abbreviated words into their corresponding full length words.",
        "The aim of this study is to explore a distributional semantic approach combined with word normalization, measured by Levenshtein distance, to abbreviation expansion.",
        "Using distributional semantic models, which can be applied to large amounts of data, has been shown to be a viable approach to extracting candidates for the underly-ing, original word of an abbreviation.",
        "In order to find the correct expansion among the semantically related candidates, we apply the Levenshtein distance measure.",
        "We report on experiments on comparative studies of various text types in Swedish, including radiology reports, medical journals and texts taken from a corpus of general Swedish.",
        "2 Background An abbreviation is a shorter ?",
        "abbreviated ?",
        "form of a word or phrase, often originating from a technical term or a named entity.",
        "Abbreviations are typically formed in one of three ways: by (i) clipping the last character sequence of the word (e.g., pat for patient or pathology), (ii) merging the initial letter(s) of the words to form an acronym (e.g., UU for Uppsala University), or (iii) merging some of the letters ?",
        "often the initial letter of the syllables ?",
        "in the word (e.g., msg for message).",
        "Abbreviations can also be formed as a combination of these three categories (e.g., EACL for Expansion of Abbreviations in CLinical text).",
        "Automatically expanding abbreviations to their original form has been of interest to computational linguists as a means to improve text-to-speech, information retrieval and information extraction systems.",
        "Rule-based systems as well as statistical and machine learning methods have been proposed to detect and expand abbreviations.",
        "A common component of most solutions is their reliance on the assumption that an abbreviation and its corresponding definition will appear in the same text.",
        "Taghva and Gilbreth (1999) present a method for automatic acronym-definition extraction in technical literature, where acronym detection is based on case and token length constraints.",
        "The surrounding text is subsequently searched for possible definitions corresponding to the detected acronym using an inexact pattern-matching algorithm.",
        "The resulting set of candidate definitions is then narrowed down by applying the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm (Nakatsu et al., 1982) to the candidate pairs.",
        "They report 98% precision and 93% recall when excluding acronyms of two or fewer characters.",
        "Park and Byrd (2001), along somewhat similar lines, propose a hybrid text mining approach for abbreviation expansion in technical literature.",
        "Orthographic constraints and stop lists are first used to detect abbreviations; candidate definitions are then extracted from the adjacent text based on a set of pre-specified conditions.",
        "The abbreviations and definitions are converted into patterns, for which transformation rules are constructed.",
        "An initial rule-base comprising the most frequent rules is subsequently employed for automatic abbreviation expansion.",
        "They report 98% precision and 94% recall as an average over three document types.",
        "In the medical domain, most approaches to abbreviation resolution also rely on the co-occurrence of abbreviations and definitions in a text, typically by exploiting the fact that abbreviations are sometimes defined on their first mention.",
        "These studies extract candidate abbreviation-definition pairs by assuming that either the definition or the abbreviation is written in parentheses (Schwartz and Hearst, 2003).",
        "The process of determining which of the extracted abbreviation-definition pairs are likely to be correct is then performed either by rule-based (Ao and Takagi, 2005) or machine learning (Chang et al., 2002; Movshovitz-Attias and Cohen, 2012) methods.",
        "Most of these studies have been conducted on English corpora; however, there is one study on Swedish medical text (Dann?ells, 2006).",
        "There are problems with this popular approach to abbreviation expansion: Yu et al. (2002) found that around 75% of all abbreviations in the biomedical literature are never defined.",
        "The application of this method to clinical text is even more problematic, as it seems highly unlikely that abbreviations would be defined in this way.",
        "The telegraphic style of clinical narrative, with its many non-standard abbreviations, is reasonably explained by time constraints in the clinical setting.",
        "There has been some work on iden-95 tifying such undefined abbreviations in clinical text (Isenius et al., 2012), as well as on finding the intended abbreviation expansion among candidates in an abbreviation dictionary (Gaudan et al., 2005).",
        "Henriksson et al. (2012; 2014) present a method for expanding abbreviations in clinical text that does not require abbreviations to be defined, or even co-occur, in the text.",
        "The method is based on distributional semantic models by effectively treating abbreviations and their corresponding definition as synonymous, at least in the sense of sharing distributional properties.",
        "Distributional semantics (see Cohen and Widdows (2009) for an overview) is based on the observation that words that occur in similar contexts tend to be semantically related (Harris, 1954).",
        "These relationships are captured in a Random Indexing (RI) word space model (Kanerva et al., 2000), where semantic similarity between words is represented as proximity in high-dimensional vector space.",
        "The RI word space representation of a corpus is obtained by assigning to each unique word an initially empty, n-dimensional context vector, as well as a static, n-dimensional index vector, which contains a small number of randomly distributed non-zero elements (-1s and 1s), with the rest of the elements set to zero 1 .",
        "For each occurrence of a word in the corpus, the index vectors of the surrounding words are added to the target word's context vector.",
        "The semantic similarity between two words can then be estimated by calculating, for in-stance, the cosine similarity between their context vectors.",
        "A set of word space models are induced from unstructured clinical data and subsequently combined in various ways with different parameter settings (i.e., sliding window size for extracting word contexts).",
        "The models and their combinations are evaluated for their ability to map a given abbreviation to its corresponding definition.",
        "The best model achieves 42% recall.",
        "Improvement of the post-processing of candidate definitions is suggested in order to obtain enhanced performance on this task.",
        "The estimate of word relatedness that is obtained from a word space model is purely statistical and has no linguistic knowledge.",
        "When word pairs should not only share distributional proper-ties, but also have similar orthographic represen-1 Generating sparse vectors of a sufficiently high dimensionality in this manner ensures that the index vectors will be nearly orthogonal.",
        "tations ?",
        "as is the case for abbreviation-definition pairs ?",
        "normalization procedures could be applied.",
        "Given a set of candidate definitions for a given abbreviation, the task of identifying plausible candidates can be viewed as a normalization problem.",
        "Petterson et al. (2013) utilize a string distance measure, Levenshtein distance (Leven- shtein, 1966), in order to normalize historical spelling of words into modern spelling.",
        "Adjusting parameters, i.e., the maximum allowed distance between source and target, according to observed distances between known word pairs of historical and modern spelling, gives a normalization accuracy of 77%.",
        "In addition to using a Levenshtein distance weighting factor of 1, they experiment with context free and context-sensitive weights for frequently occurring edits between word pairs in a training corpus.",
        "The context-free weights are calculated on the basis of one-to-one standard edits involving two characters; in this setting the normalization accuracy is increased to 78.7%.",
        "Frequently occurring edits that involve more than two characters, e.g., substituting two characters for one, serve as the basis for calculating context-sensitive weights and gives a normalization accuracy of 79.1%.",
        "Similar ideas are here applied to abbreviation expansion by utilizing a normalization procedure for candidate expansion selection.",
        "3 Method The current study aims to replicate and extend a subset of the experiments conducted by Henriksson et al. (2012), namely those that concern the abbreviation expansion task.",
        "This includes the various word space combinations and the parameter optimization.",
        "The evaluation procedure is similar to the one described in (Henriksson et al., 2012).",
        "The current study, however, focuses on post-processing of the semantically related words by introducing a filter and a normalization procedure in an attempt to improve performance.",
        "An overview of the approach is depicted in Figure 1.",
        "Abbreviation expansion can be viewed as a two-step procedure, where the first step involves de-tection, or extraction, of abbreviations, and the second step involves identifying plausible expansions.",
        "Here, the first step is achieved by extracting abbreviations from a clinical corpus with clinical abbreviation detection software and using a list of known medical abbreviations.",
        "The second step is performed by first extracting a set of semantically 96 clinical text abbreviation extraction abbreviations baseline corpus word space induction expansion word extraction clinical word space expansion word filtering Levenshtein distance normalization abbreviation-candidate expansions evaluation Figure 1: The abbreviation expansion process of the current study.",
        "similar words for each abbreviation and treating these as initial expansions.",
        "More plausible expansions of each abbreviation are then obtained by filtering the expansion words and applying a normalization procedure.",
        "3.1 Data 3.1.1 Corpora Four corpora are used in the experiments: two clinical corpora, a medical (non-clinical) corpus and a general Swedish corpus (Table 1).",
        "The clinical corpora are subsets of the Stockholm EPR Corpus (Dalianis et al., 2009), comprising health records for over one million patients from 512 clinical units in the Stockholm region over a five-year period (2006-2010) 2 .",
        "One of the clinical corpora contains records from various clinical units, for the first five months of 2008, henceforth referred to as SEPR, and the other contains radiology examination reports, produced in 2009 and 2010, the Stockholm EPR X-ray Corpus (Kvist and Velupillai, 2013) henceforth referred to as SEPR-X.",
        "The clinical corpora were lemmatized 2 This research has been approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm (Etikpr?ovningsnamnden i Stock-holm), permission number 2012/2028-31/5 using Granska (Knutsson et al., 2003).",
        "The experiments in the current study also include a medical corpus.",
        "The electronic editions of L?akartidningen (Journal of the Swedish Medical Association), with issues from 1996 to 2010, have been compiled into a corpus (Kokkinakis, 2012), here referred to as LTK.",
        "To compare the medical texts to general Swedish, the third version of the Stockholm Ume?a Corpus (SUC 3.0) (K?allgren, 1998) is used.",
        "It is a balanced corpus and consists of written Swedish texts from the early 1990's from various genres.",

        "The list is derived from Cederblom (2005) and comprises 6384 unique abbreviations from patient records, referrals and scientific articles.",
        "To increase the size of the test data, the 40 most frequent abbreviations are extracted by a heuristics-based clinical abbreviation detection tool called SCAN (Isenius et al., 2012).",
        "A domain expert validated these abbreviations and manually provided the correct expansion(s).",
        "An inherent property of word space models is that they model semantic relationships between unigrams.",
        "There are, however, abbreviations that expand into multiword expressions.",
        "Ongoing research on modeling semantic composition with word space models exists, but, in the current study abbreviations that expanded to multiword definitions were simply removed from the test data set.",
        "The two sets of abbreviation-expansion pairs were merged into a single test set, containing 1231 unique entries in total.",
        "In order to obtain statistically reliable semantic relations in the word space, the terms of interest must be sufficiently frequent in the data.",
        "As a result, only abbreviation-expansion pairs with frequencies over 50 in SEPR and SEPR-X, respec-tively, were included in each test set.",
        "The SEPR test set contains 328 entries and the SEPR-X test 97 set contains 211 entries.",
        "Each of the two test data sets is split into a development set (80%) for model selection, and a test set (20%) for final performance estimation.",
        "3.2 Expansion word extraction For the experiments where semantically related words were used for extraction of expansion words, the top 100 most correlated words for each of the abbreviations were retrieved from each of the word space model configurations that achieved the best results in the parameter optimization experiments.",
        "The optimal parameter settings of a word space vary with the task and data at hand.",
        "It has been shown that when modeling paradigmatic (e.g., synonymous) relations in word spaces, a fairly small context window size is preferable (Sahlgren, 2006).",
        "Following the best results of Henriksson et al. (2012), we experiment with window sizes of 1+1, 2+2, and 4+4.",
        "Two word space algorithms are explored: Random Indexing (RI), to retrieve the words that occur in a similar context as the query term, and Random Permutation (RP), which also incorporates word order information when accumulating the context vectors (Sahlgren et al., 2008).",
        "In order to exploit the advantages of both algorithms, and to combine models with different parameter settings, RI and RP model combinations are also evaluated.",
        "The models and their combinations are: ?",
        "Random Indexing (RI): words with a contextually high similarity are returned; word order within the context window is ignored.",
        "?",
        "Random Permutation (RP): words that are contextually similar and used in the same relative positions are returned; these are more likely to share grammatical properties.",
        "?",
        "RP-filtered RI candidates (RI RP): returns the top ten terms in the RI model that are among the top thirty terms in the RP model.",
        "?",
        "RI-filtered RP candidates (RP RI): returns the top ten terms in the RP model that are among the top thirty terms in the RI model.",
        "?",
        "RI and RP combination of similarity scores (RI+RP): sums the cosine similarity scores from the two models for each candidate term and returns the candidates with the highest aggregate score.",
        "All models are induced with three different context window sizes for the two clinical corpora, SEPR and SEPR-X.",
        "For each corpus, two variants are used for word space induction, one where stop words are removed and one where stop words are retained.",
        "All word spaces are induced with a dimensionality of 1000.",
        "For parameter optimization and model selec-tion, the models and model combinations are queried for semantically similar words.",
        "For each of the abbreviations in the development set, the ten most similar words are retrieved.",
        "Recall is computed with regard to this list of candidate words, whether the correct expansion is among these ten candidates.",
        "Since the size of the test data is rather limited, 3-fold cross validation is performed on the development set for the parameter optimization experiments.",
        "For both SEPR and SEPR-X development sets, a combination of a RI model with a context window size of 4+4 and a RP model with 4+4 context window size in the summing similarity scores setting were among the most successful with recall scores of 0.25 for SEPR and 0.17 for SEPR-X.",
        "3.3 Filtering expansion words Given the expansion words, extracted from clinical word spaces or baseline corpora (the baselines are more thoroughly accounted for in 3.5), a filter was applied in order to generate candidate expansions.",
        "The filter was defined as a set of require-ments, which had to be met in order for the expansion word to be extracted as a candidate expansion.",
        "The requirements were that the intitial letter of the abbreviation and expansion word had to be identical.",
        "All the letters of the abbreviation also had to be present in the expansion word in the same order.",
        "String length difference was also a part of the requirements: the expansion word had to be at least one character longer than the abbreviation.",
        "In order to define an upper bound for expansion token length, string length differences of the SEPR and SEPR-X development sets were obtained.",
        "The distribution of string length differences for abbreviation-expansion pairs in the SEPR development set ranged from 1 to 21 characters.",
        "If a maximum string length difference of 14 was al-lowed, 95.2% of the abbreviation-expansion pairs were covered.",
        "As for the string length differences in the SEPR-X development set, the distribution ranged from 1 to 21 characters.",
        "If a string length difference of up to and including 14 characters was allowed, 96.3% of the abbreviation-expansion pairs were covered.",
        "Thus, a maximum difference 98 in string length of 14 was also required for the expansion word to be extracted as a candidate expansion.",
        "3.4 Levenshtein distance normalization Given the set of filtered candidate expansions for the abbreviations, choosing the correct one can be seen as a normalization problem.",
        "The goal is to map a source word to a target word, similarly to for instance methods for spelling correction.",
        "The target word is chosen from a list of words, and the choice is based on the distance between the source and the target where a small distance implies high plausibility.",
        "However, we cannot adopt the same assumptions as for the problem of spelling correc-tion, where the most common distance between a source word and the correct target word is 1 (Ku- kich, 1992).",
        "Intuitively, we can expect that there are abbreviations that expand to words within a larger distance than 1.",
        "It would seem somewhat useless to abbreviate words by one character only, although it is not entirely improbable.",
        "Similarly to measuring the string length difference in order to define an upper bound for filtering candidate expansions, the Levenshtein distances for abbreviation-expansion pairs in the development sets were obtained.",
        "For the SEPR and SEPR-X development sets, allowing a Levenshtein distance up to and including 14 covers 97.8% and 96.6% of the abbreviation-expansion pairs, as shown in Table 2.",
        "Given the filtered candidate expansions, the Levenshtein distance for the abbreviation and each of the candidate expansions were computed.",
        "For each one of the candidate expansions, the Levenshtein distance beween the entry and the abbreviation was associated with the entry.",
        "The resulting list was sorted in ascending order according to Levenshtein distance.",
        "Going through the candidate expansion list, if the Levenshtein distance was less than or identical to the upper bound for Levenshtein distance (14), the candidate expansion was added to the expansion list that was subsequently used in the evaluation.",
        "In the Levenshtein distance normalization experiments, a combination of semantically related words and words from LTK was used.",
        "When compiling the expansion list, semantically related words were prioritized.",
        "This implied that word space candidate expansion would occupy the top positions in the expansion list, in ascending order SEPR SEPR SEPR-X SEPR-X LD Avg % SDev Avg % SDev 1 1 0.3 0.4 0.2 2 4.6 0.4 5 0.6 3 13 1.2 14.7 1.3 4 12.2 1 15.1 0.6 5 12.7 1.3 14.5 2.2 6 12.7 0.8 12.9 0.9 7 8.4 0.7 7.8 0.3 8 10.4 1.5 9.8 2 9 5.7 0.7 4.9 0.5 10 4.1 0.7 2.9 0.3 11 3 0.5 2.6 0.4 12 3 0.6 2.6 0.4 13 3.8 5.5 1.3 0.5 14 3.5 1.1 2.2 0.8 15 1.3 0.5 1.3 0.5 16 1.6 0.4 0.4 0.2 17 0.2 0.1 18 0.8 0.3 1 0.1 20 0.2 0.1 21 0.2 0.1 0.5 0 Table 2: Levenshtein distance distribution for abbreviation-expansion pairs.",

        "If there were more than one candidate expansion at a specific Levenshtein distance, ranking of these was randomized.",
        "3.5 Evaluation The evaluation procedure of the abbreviation expansion implied assessing the ability of finding the correct expansions for abbreviations.",
        "In order to evaluate the performance gain of using semantic similarity to produce the list of candidate expansions over using the filtering and normalization procedure alone, a baseline was created.",
        "For the baseline, expansion words were instead extracted from the baseline corpora, the corpus of general Swedish SUC 3.0 and the medical corpus LTK.",
        "A list of all the lemma forms from each baseline 99 corpus (separately) was provided for each abbreviation as initial expansion words.",
        "The filter and normalization procedure was then applied to these expansion words.",
        "The reference standard contained abbreviation-expansion pairs, as described in 3.1.2.",
        "If any of the correct expansions (some of the abbreviations had multiple correct expansions) was present in the expansion list provided for each abbreviation in the test set, this was regarded as a true positive.",
        "Precision was computed with regard to the position of the correct expansion in the list and the number of expansions in the expansion list, as suggested in Henriksson (2013).",
        "For an abbreviation that expanded to one word only, this implied that the expansion list besides holding the correct expansion, also contained nine incorrect expansions, which was taken into account when computing precision.",
        "The list size was static: ten expansions were provided for each abbreviation, and this resulted in an overall low precision.",
        "Few of the abbreviations in the development set expanded to more than one word, giving a precision of 0.17-0.18 for all experiments.",
        "Results of baseline abbreviation expansion in the development sets are given in table 3.",
        "Recall is given as an average of 5 folds, as cross validation was performed.",
        "The baseline achieves overall low recall, with the lowest score of 0.08 for the SEPR-X development set using SUC for candidate expansion extraction.",

        "Baseline recall scores were 0.09 and 0.08 for SUC and LTK respectively, showing a lower score for LTK compared to the results on the SEPR development set.",
        "For abbreviation expansion (with filtering and normalization) using semantically related words in combination with LTK, the best recall score was 0.38 for the SEPR test set, compared to 0.39 for the same model evaluated on the SEPR development set.",

        "Evaluation on the SEPR-X test set gave higher recall scores for both baseline corpora compared to the baseline results for the SEPR-X development set: the SUC result increased by 8 percentage points for recall.",
        "For LTK, there was an increase in recall of 3 percentage points.",
        "For the SEPR-X test set, recall increased by 22 percentage points when filtering and normalization was applied to semantically related words extracted from the best model configuration.",
        "In comparison to the results of Henriksson et al (2012), where recall of the best model is 0.31 without and 0.42 with post-processing of the expansion words for word spaces induced from the data set (i.e., an increase in recall by 11 percentage points), the filtering and normalization procedure for expansion words of the current study yielded an increase by 18 percentage points.",
        "5 Discussion The filter combined with the Levenshtein normalisation procedure to refine candidate expansion selection showed a slight improvement compared to using post-processing, although the normalization procedure should be elaborated in order to be able to confidently claim that Levenshtein distance normalization is a better approach to expansion candidate selection.",
        "A suggestion for future work is to introduce weights based on frequently occurring edits between abbreviations and expansions and to apply these in abbreviation normalization.",
        "The approach presented in this study is limited to abbreviations that translate into one full length word.",
        "Future research should include handling multiword expressions, not only unigrams, in order to process acronyms and initialisms.",
        "Recall of the development sets in the word space parameter optimization experiments showed higher scores for SEPR (0.25) compared to SEPR-X (0.17).",
        "An explanation to this could be that the amount of data preprocessing done prior to word space induction might have varied, in terms of excluding sentences with little or no clinical content.",
        "This will of course affect word space co-occurrence information, as word context is accumulated without taking sentence boundaries into account.",
        "The lemmatization of the clinical text used for word space induction left some words in their original form, causing test data and semantically related words to be morphologically discrepant.",
        "Lemmatization adapted to clinical text might have improved results.",
        "Spelling errors were also frequent in the clinical text, and abbreviations were sometimes normalized into a misspelled variant of the correct expansion.",
        "In the future, spelling correction could be added and combined with abbreviation expansion.",
        "The impact that this apporach to abbreviation expansion might have on readability of clinical texts should also be assessed by means of an extrinsic evaluation, a matter to be pursued in future research.",
        "6 Conclusions We presented automatic expansion of abbreviations consisting of unigram full-length words in clinical texts.",
        "We applied a distributional semantic approach by using word space models and combined this with Levenshtein distance measures to choose the correct candidate among the semantically related words.",
        "The results show that the correct expansion of the abbreviation can be found in 40% of the cases, an improvement by 24 percentage points compared to the baseline (0.16) and an increase by 22 percentage points compared to using word space models alone (0.18).",
        "Applying Levenshtein distance to refine the selection of semantically related candidate expansions yields a total recall of 0.38 and 0.40 for radiology reports and medical health records, respectively.",
