        "Document classification using automated linguistic analysis and machine learning (ML) has been shown to be a viable road forward for readability assessment.",
        "The best models can be trained to decide if a text is easy to read or not with very high accuracy, e.g. a model using 117 parameters from shallow, lexical, morphological and syntactic analyses achieves 98,9% accuracy.",
        "In this paper we compare models created by parameter optimization over subsets of that total model to find out to which extent different high-performing models tend to consist of the same parameters and if it is possible to find models that only use features not requiring parsing.",
        "We used a genetic algorithm to systematically optimize parameter sets of fixed sizes using accuracy of a Support Vector Machine classifier as fitness function.",
        "Our results show that it is possible to find models almost as good as the currently best models while omitting parsing based features."

        "The problem of readability assessment is the problem of mapping from a text to some unit representing the text's degree of readability.",
        "Measures of readability are mostly used to inform a reader how difficult a text is to read, either to give them a hint that they may try to find an easier to read text on the same topic or simply to inform them that a text may take some time to comprehend.",
        "Readability measures are mainly used to inform persons with reading disabilities on the complexity of a text, but can also be used to, for instance, assist teachers with assessing the reading ability of a student.",
        "By measuring the reading abilities of a person, it might also be possible to automatically find texts that fits that persons reading ability.",
        "Since the early 2000s the speed and accuracy of text analysis tools such as lemmatizers, part-of-speech taggers and syntax parsers have made new text features available for readability assessment.",
        "By using machine learning a number of researchers have devised innovative ways of assessing readability.",
        "For instance, phrase grammar parsing has been used to find the average number of sub-clauses, verb phrases, noun phrases and average tree depth (Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005).",
        "The use of language models to assess the degree of readability was also introduced in the early 2000s (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004) and later combined with classification algorithms such as support vector machines to further increase accuracy (Petersen, 2007; Feng, 2010).",
        "In this paper we investigate if it is possible to find a set of parameters for easy-to-read classifica-tion, on par with the best models used today, without using parsing based features.",
        "Finding such a set would facilitate portability and provide faster assessment of readability.",
        "2 Method To train and test our classifier we used one easy-to-read corpus and five corpora representing ordinary language in different text genres.",
        "The latter corpora is referred to as non-easy-to-read in this paper.",
        "For each category we used 700 texts.",
        "Our source of easy-to-read material was the L?SBarT corpus (M?hlenbock, 2008).",
        "L?SBarT consists of manually created easy-to-read texts 114 from a variety of sources and genres.",
        "The non-easy-to-read material comprised texts from a variety of corpora.",
        "This material consisted of 215 news text articles from GP2007 (The Swedish news paper G?teborgs Posten), 34 whole issues of the Swedish popular science magazine Forskning och Framsteg, 214 articles from the professional news magazine L?kartidningen 05 (physician news articles), 214 public information notices from The Public Health Agency of Sweden (Smittskyddsinstitutet) and 23 full fiction novels from a Swedish book publisher (the Norstedts publishing house).",
        "By using a corpus with such a variety of documents we got non-easy-to-read documents from different genres which is important as we want to be able to use the same model on all types of text.",
        "We also lowered the risk of genre classification rather than degree of readability classification.",
        "The texts were preprocessed using the Korp corpus import tool (Borin et al., 2012).",
        "Steps in the preprocessing chain relevant for this study were tokenization, lemmatisation, part-of-speech tagging and dependency grammar parsing.",
        "We used a large number of different text features proposed for readability assessment for both Swedish and English.",
        "We use both the term's feature (property of the text) and parameter (in- put to the ML-system).",
        "Some features consist of more than one parameter.",
        "In the paper we use the terms features and parameters somewhat interchangeably.",
        "However, technically, a feature is a property of the text, a parameter is input to the machine learning system.",
        "A few of the text features we use are represented as a combination of parameters and in these cases we select single pa-rameters, not full features.",
        "2.1 Non-parsing features The three most used traditional text quality metrics used to measure readability for Swedish are: LIX L?sbarhetsindex, readability index.",
        "Ratio of words longer than 6 characters coupled with average sentence length, Equation 1.",
        "This is the standard readability measure used for Swedish and can be considered baseline similar to the Flesch-Kincaid formula (Kincaid et al., 1975).",
        "lix = n(w) n(s) +( n(words > 6 chars) n(w) ?100) (1) where n(s) denotes the number of sentences and n(w) the number of words.",
        "OVIX Ordvariationsindex, word variation index, related to type-token ratio.",
        "Logarithms are used to cancel out type-token ratio problems with variable text length, Equation 2. ovix = log(n(w)) log(2 ?",
        "log(n(uw)) log(n(w)) ) (2) where n(w) denotes the number of words and n(uw) the number of unique words.",
        "NR Nominal ratio, the ratio of nominal word, used to measure formality of text rather than readability, however, this is traditionally assumed to correlate to readability, Equation 3.",
        "Nr = n(noun) + n(prep) + n(part) n(pro) + n(adv) + n(v) (3) where n(noun) denotes the number of nouns, n(prep) the number of prepositions, n(part) the number of participles, n(pro) the number of pronouns, n(adv) the number of adverbs, and n(v) the number of verbs.",
        "2.1.1 Shallow features The shallow text features are the main features traditionally used for simple readability metrics.",
        "They occur in the \"shallow\" surface structure of the text and can be extracted after tokenization by simply counting words and characters.",
        "They in-clude: AWLC Average word length calculated as the average number of characters per word.",
        "AWLS Average word length calculated as the average number of syllables per word.",
        "The number of syllables is approximated by counting the number of vowels.",
        "ASL Average sentence length calculated as the average number of words per sentence.",
        "115 Longer sentences, as well as longer words, tend to predict a more difficult text as exemplified by the performance of the LIX metric and related metrics for English.",
        "These types of features have been used in a number of readability studies based on machine learning (Feng, 2010) and as baseline when evaluating new features (Pitler and Nenkova, 2008).",
        "2.1.2 Lexical features Our lexical features are based on categorical word frequencies.",
        "The word frequencies are extracted after lemmatization and are calculated using the basic Swedish vocabulary SweVoc (Heimann M?hlenbock, 2013).",
        "SweVoc is comparable to the list used in the classic Dale-Chall formula for English (Dale and Chall, 1949).",
        "Though developed for similar purposes, special sub-categories have been added (of which three are specifically consid-ered).",
        "The following frequencies are calculated, based on different categories in SweVoc: SweVocC SweVoc lemmas fundamental for communication (category C).",
        "SweVocD SweVoc lemmas for everyday use (cat- egory D).",
        "SweVocH SweVoc other highly frequent lemmas (category H).",
        "SweVocT Unique, per lemma, SweVoc words (all categories, including some not mentioned above) per sentence.",
        "A high ratio of SweVoc words should indicate a more easy-to-read text.",
        "The Dale-Chall metric (Chall and Dale, 1995) has been used as a similar feature in a number of machine learning based studies of text readability for English (Feng, 2010; Pitler and Nenkova, 2008).",
        "The SweVoc metrics are also related to the language model features used in a number of studies (Schwarm and Osten-dorf, 2005; Heilman et al., 2008).",
        "2.1.3 The morpho-syntactic features The morpho-syntactic features concern a morphology based analysis of text.",
        "For the purposes of this study the analysis relies on previously part-of-speech annotated text, which is investigated with regard to the following features: Part-of-speech tag ratio Unigram probabilities for the different parts-of-speech tags in the document, that is, the ratio of each part-of-speech, on a per token basis, as individual parameters.",
        "This is viewed as a single feature but is represented by 26 parameters, see Table 2.",
        "Such a language model based on part-of-speech, and similar metrics, has shown to be a relevant feature for readability assessment for English (Heilman et al., 2007; Pe-tersen, 2007; Dell?Orletta et al., 2011) and for Swedish (Falkenjack et al., 2013).",
        "RC The ratio of content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs), on a per token basis, in the text.",
        "Such a metric has been used in a number of related studies (Alusio et al., 2010).",
        "2.2 Parsing based features These features are estimable after syntactic parsing of the text.",
        "The syntactic feature set is extracted after dependency parsing using the Malt-parser (Nivre et al., 2006).",
        "Such parsers have been used for preprocessing texts for readability assessment for Italian (Dell?Orletta et al., 2011).",
        "The dependency based features consist of: ADDD The average dependency distance in the document on a per dependent basis.",
        "A longer average dependency distance could indicate a more complex text (Liu, 2008).",
        "ADDS The average dependency distance in the document on a per sentence basis.",
        "A longer average total dependency distance per sentence could indicate a more complex text (Liu, 2008).",
        "RD The ratio of right dependencies to total number of dependencies in the document.",
        "A high ratio of right dependencies could indicate a more complex text.",
        "SD The average sentence depth.",
        "Sentences with deeper dependency trees could be indicative of a more complex text in the same way as phrase grammar trees has been shown to be (Petersen and Ostendorf, 2009).",
        "Dependency type tag ratio Unigram probabilities for the dependency type tags resulting from the dependency parsing, on a per token basis, as individual parameters.",
        "This is viewed as a single feature but is represented by 63 parameters, see Tables 4 and 5.",
        "116 These parameters make up a unigram language model and is comparable to the phrase type rate based on phrase grammar parsing used in earlier research (Nenkova et al., 2010).",
        "Such a language model was shown to be a good predictor for degree of readability in Swedish text (Falkenjack et al., 2013).",
        "VR The ratio of sentences with a verbal root, that is, the ratio of sentences where the root word is a verb to the total number of sentences (Dell?Orletta et al., 2011).",
        "AVA The average arity of verbs in the document, calculated as the average number of depen-dents per verb (Dell?Orletta et al., 2011).",
        "UVA The ratio of verbs with an arity of 0-7 as distinct features (Dell?Orletta et al., 2011).",
        "This is viewed as a single feature but is represented by 8 parameters.",
        "TPC The average number of tokens per clause in the document.",
        "This is related to the shallow feature average number of tokens per sentence.",
        "PreM The average number of nominal pre-modifiers per sentence.",
        "PostM The average number of nominal post-modifiers per sentence.",
        "PC The average number of prepositional complements per sentence in the document.",
        "Compound models We have also created a number of compound models, comprising metrics from sets of features; all traditional measures, all shallow features, all lexical features, all morpho-syntactic features, all syntactic fea-tures, and all features (Total), see Table 3.",
        "Falkenjack et al. (2013) also looked at incremental combinations of these same models.",
        "2.3 Parameter optimization The models for parameter optimization are created from various subsets of the text features using a genetic algorithm.",
        "Lau (2006) performed experiments on using genetic algorithms to select significant features that are useful when assessing readability for Chinese.",
        "Starting with 64 features, mainly various stroke features but also more traditional features, such as, measuring amount of familiar and common words, a genetic algorithm was used to find optimal feature subsets.",
        "Based on investigations of using three different fitness functions it was shown that a set of 15 features is sufficient and the best feature set for each fitness function is selected for further studies.",
        "These feature sets are then evaluated using SVR (Support Vector Regression) to train readability models and finally test them on the texts.",
        "In our work we do not first select feature sets and then train the model on them.",
        "Instead feature sets, generated by genetic search, are used to train the readability model, using SVM, and then the models are tested.",
        "We performed a number of trials based on different base sets of parameters.",
        "In each case the space we searched through had the size ( |b| s ) , where b is the base set of parameters and s is the size of the model we were searching for.",
        "We performed genetic searches through model spaces for 1000 generations.",
        "Each generation contained 10 chromosomes, i.e. models, 7 created by crossover and 3 randomly generated to avoid getting stuck in local maxima.",
        "The crossover worked by randomly selecting parameters from the locally optimal parameter set of the prior generation.",
        "This locally optimal parameter set was created by taking the union of the best performing chromosomes until the size of the set exceeded the size of the target selection plus 4.",
        "In the rare cases where the parameters in the total parent generation did not exceed this number all parameters from the parent generation were used.",
        "The fitness function consisted of a 7-fold cross-validation test run of a Support Vector Machine trained by Sequential Minimal Optimization (Platt, 1998).",
        "For this we used the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis, or Weka.",
        "The accuracy of a model was used as its fitness and used to order each generation from best to worst performing.",
        "3 Results We first present results from using only the single features and the compound models.",
        "We then present the results from the various models generated by our method.",
        "We provide performance measures for single features for comparison in Tables 1 and 2.",

        "Our results show that, at least for Swedish, it is possible to find models almost as good the currently best models while omitting parsing based features.",
        "Our algorithm found a model of 8 non-syntactic parameters which predicted readability with an accuracy of 98.5%.",
        "This is almost as accurate as a 117 parameter model, including parsing based features, with an accuracy of 98.9% Our study was conducted for Swedish texts but only a few of the metrics used are specific to Swedish and the optimization method itself is language independent, thus, the method can easily be applied to other languages.",
