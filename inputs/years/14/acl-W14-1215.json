        "People with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) show a diverse range of reading abilities: on the one hand, 5%-10% of users have the capacity to read words from an early age without the need for formal learning (hyperlexia), on the other hand many users demonstrate weak comprehension of what has been read (Volkmar and Wiesner, 2009).",
        "They may have difficulty inferring contextual information or may have trouble understanding mental verbs or emotional language, as well as long sentences with complex syntactic structure (Tager-Flusberg, 1981; Kover et al., 2012).",
        "To address these difficulties, the FIRST project 1 is developing a tool which makes texts more accessible for people with ASD.",
        "In order to get a better understanding of the needs of these readers, a thorough analysis was carried out to derive a list of high priority obstacles to reading comprehension.",
        "Some of these obstacles are related to syntactic complexity and constitute the focus of this paper.",
        "Even though the research in the FIRST project focuses on people with ASD, many of the obstacles 1 http://first-asd.eu identified in the project can pose difficulties for a wide range of readers such as language learners and people with other language disorders.",
        "This paper presents and evaluates a set of rules used for simplifying English complex and compound sentences.",
        "These rules were developed as part of a syntactic simplification system which was initially developed for users with ASD, but which can also be used for other tasks that require syntactic simplification of sentences.",
        "In our research, we consider that syntactic complexity is usually indicated by the occurrence of certain markers or signs of syntactic complexity, referred to hereafter as signs, such as punctuation ([,] and [;]), conjunctions ([and], [but], and [or]), complementisers ([that]) or wh-words ([what], [when], [where], [which], [while], [who]).",
        "These signs may have a range of syntactic linking and bounding functions which need to be automatically identified, and which we analysed in more detail in (Evans and Orasan, 2013).",
        "Our syntactic simplification process operates in two steps.",
        "In the first, signs of syntactic complexity are automatically classified and in the second, manually crafted rules are applied to simplify the relevant sentences.",
        "Section 3 presents more details about the method.",
        "Evaluation of automatic simplification is a difficult issue.",
        "Given that the purpose of this paper is to gain a better understanding of the performance of the rules used for simplifying compound sentences and complex sentences, Section 4 presents the methodology developed for this evaluation and discusses the results obtained.",
        "The paper finishes with conclusions.",
        "2 Background information Despite some findings to the contrary (Arya et al., 2011), automatic syntactic simplification has been motivated by numerous neurolinguistic and psycholinguistic studies.",
        "Brain imaging studies indicate that processing syntactically complex struc-131 tures requires more neurological activity than processing simple structures (Just et al., 1996).",
        "A study undertaken by Levy et al. (2012) showed that people with aphasia are better able to understand syntactically simple reversible sentences than syntactically complex ones.",
        "Further motivation is brought by research in NLP, which demonstrates that performance levels in information extraction (Agarwal and Boggess, 1992; Rindflesch et al., 2000; Evans, 2011), syntactic parsing (Tomita, 1985; McDonald and Nivre, 2011), and, to some extent, machine translation (Gerber and Hovy, 1998) are somewhat determined by the length and syntactic complexity of the sentences being processed.",
        "Numerous rule-based methods for syntactic simplification have been developed (Siddharthan, 2006) and used to facilitate NLP tasks such as biomedical information extraction (Agarwal and Boggess, 1992; Rindflesch et al., 2000; Evans, 2011).",
        "In these approaches, rules are triggered by pattern-matching applied to the output of text analysis tool such as partial parsers and POS tag-gers.",
        "Chandrasekar and Srinivas (1997) presented an automatic method to learn syntactic simplification rules for use in such systems.",
        "Unfortu-nately, that approach is only capable of learning a restricted range of rules and requires access to expensive annotated resources.",
        "With regard to applications improving text accessibility for human readers, Max (2000) described the use of syntactic simplification for aphasic readers.",
        "In work on the PSET project, Canning (2002) implemented a system which exploits a syntactic parser in order to rewrite compound sentences as sequences of simple sentences and to convert passive sentences into active ones for readers with aphasia.",
        "The success of these systems is tied to the performance levels of the syntactic parsers that they employ.",
        "More recently, the availability of resources such as Simple Wikipedia has enabled text simplification to be included in the paradigm of statistical machine translation (Yatskar et al., 2010; Coster and Kauchak, 2011).",
        "In this context, translation models are learned by aligning sentences in Wikipedia with their corresponding versions in Simple Wikipedia.",
        "Manifesting Basic English (Ogden, 1932), the extent to which Simple Wikipedia is accessible to people with autism has not yet been fully assessed.",
        "The field of text summarisation includes numerous approaches that can be regarded as examples of syntactic simplification.",
        "For example, Cohn and Lapata (2009) present a tree-to-tree transduction method that is used to filter non-essential information from syntactically parsed sentences.",
        "This compression process often reduces the syntactic complexity of those sentences.",
        "An advantage of this approach is that it can identify elements for deletion even when such elements are not indicated by explicit signs of syntactic complexity.",
        "The difficulty is that they rely on high levels of accuracy and granularity of automatic syntactic analysis.",
        "As noted earlier, it has been observed that the accuracy of parsers is inversely proportional to the length and complexity of the sentences being analysed (Tomita, 1985; McDonald and Nivre, 2011).",
        "The approach to syntactic simplification described in the current paper is a two step process involving detection and tagging of the bounding and linking functions of various signs of syntactic complexity followed by a rule-based sentence rewriting step.",
        "Relevant to the first step, Van Delden and Gomez (2002) developed a machine learning method to determine the syntactic roles of commas.",
        "Meier et al. (2012) describe German language resources in which the linking functions of commas and semicolons are annotated.",
        "The annotated resources exploited by the machine learning method presented in Section 3.2.1 of the current paper are presented in (Evans and Orasan, 2013).",
        "From a linguistic perspective, Nunberg et al. (2002) provide a grammatical analysis of punctuation in English.",
        "The work described in this paper was undertaken in a project aiming to improve the accessibility of text for people with autism.",
        "It was motivated at least in part by the work of O?Connor and Klein (2004), which describes strategies to facilitate the reading comprehension of people with ASD.",
        "The proposed method is intended to reduce complexity caused by both complex and compound sentences and differs from those described earlier in this section.",
        "Sentence compression methods are not suitable for the types of rewriting required in simplifying compound sentences.",
        "Parsers are more likely to have lower accuracy when processing these sentences, and therefore the proposed method does not use information about the syntactic structure of sentences in the process.",
        "Our method is presented in the next section.",
        "132 3 The syntactic simplifier In our research, we regard coordination and subordination as key elements of syntactic complexity.",
        "A thorough study of the potential obstacles to the reading comprehension of people with autism highlighted particular types of syntactic complex-ity, many of which are linked to coordination and subordination.",
        "Section 3.1 briefly presents the main obstacles linked to syntactic complexity identified by the study.",
        "It should be mentioned that most of the obstacles are problematic not only for autistic people and other types of reader can also benefit from their removal.",
        "The obstacles identified constituted the basis for developing the simplification approach briefly described in Section 3.2.",
        "3.1 User requirements Consultations with 94 subjects meeting the strict DSM-IV criteria for ASD and with IQ > 70 led to the derivation of user preferences and high priority user requirements related to structural processing.",
        "A comprehensive explanation of the findings can be found in (Martos et al., 2013).",
        "This section discusses briefly the two types of information of relevance to the processing of sentence complexity obtained in our study.",
        "First, in terms of the demand for access to texts of particular genres/domains, it was found that young people (aged 12-16) seek access to documents in informative (arts/leisure) domains and they have less interest in periodicals and newspapers or imaginative texts.",
        "Adults (aged 16+) seek access to informative and scientific texts (includ- ing newspapers), imaginative text, and the language of social networking and communication.",
        "In an attempt to accommodate the interests of both young people and adults, we developed a corpus which contains newspaper articles, texts about health, and literary texts.",
        "Second, the specific morpho-syntactic phenomena that pose obstacles to reading comprehension that are relevant to this paper are: 1.",
        "Compound sentences, which should be split into sentences containing a single clause.",
        "2.",
        "Complex sentences: in which relative clauses should either be: (a) converted into adjectival pre-modifiers or (b) deleted from complex sentences and used to generate copular constructions linking the NP in the matrix clause with the predication of the relative clause In addition, the analysis revealed other types of obstacles such as explicative clauses, which should be deleted, and uncommon conjunctions (including conjuncts) which should be replaced by more common ones.",
        "Conditional clauses that follow the main clause and non-initial adverbial clauses should be pre-posed, and passive sentences should be converted in the active form.",
        "Various formatting issues such as page breaks that occur within paragraphs and end-of-line hyphenation are also problematic and should be avoided.",
        "Section 3.2 describes the method developed to address the obstacles caused by compound and complex sentences.",
        "3.2 The approach Processing of obstacles to reading comprehension in this research has focused on detection and reduction of syntactic complexity caused by the occurrence in text of compound sentences (1) and complex sentences (2).",
        "(1) Elaine Trego never bonded with 16-month-old Jacob [and] he was often seen with bruises, a murder trial was told.",
        "(2) The two other patients, who are far more fragile than me, would have been killed by the move.",
        "In (1), the underlined phrases are the conjoins of a coordinate constituent.",
        "In (2), the underlined phrase is a subordinate constituent of the larger, superordinate phrase the two other patients, who are far more fragile than me.",
        "The overall syntactic simplification pipeline consists of the following steps: Step 1.",
        "Tagging of signs of syntactic complexity with information about their syntactic linking or bounding functions Step 2.",
        "The complexity of sentences tagged in step 1 is assessed and used to trigger the application of two iterative simplification pro-cesses, which are applied exhaustively and sequentially to each input sentence: 133 a. Decomposition of compound sentences (the simplification function converts one input string into two output strings) b. Decomposition of complex sentences (the simplification function converts one input string into two output strings) Step 3.",
        "Personalised transformation of sentences according to user preference profiles which list obstacles to be tackled and the threshold complexity levels that specify whether simplification is necessary.",
        "Steps 1 and 2 are applied iteratively ensuring that an input sentence can be exhaustively simplified by decomposition of the input string into pairs of progressively simpler sentences.",
        "No further simplification is applied to a sentence when the system is unable to detect any signs of syntactic complexity within it.",
        "This paper reports on steps 1 and 2.",
        "The personalisation step, which takes into consideration the needs of individual users, is not discussed.",
        "3.2.1 Identification of signs of complexity Signs of syntactic complexity typically indicate constituent boundaries, e.g. punctuation marks, conjunctions, and complementisers.",
        "To facilitate information extraction, a rule-based approach to simplify coordinated conjoins was proposed by Evans (2011), which relies on classifying signs based on their linking functions.",
        "In more recent work, an extended annotation scheme was proposed in (Evans and Orasan, 2013) which enables the encoding of links and boundaries between a wider range of syntactic constituents and covers more syntactic phenomena.",
        "A corpus covering three text categories (news ar-ticles, literature, and patient healthcare information leaflets), was annotated using this extended scheme.",
        "2 Most sign labels contain three types of infor-mation: boundary type, syntactic projection level, and grammatical category of the constituent(s).",
        "Some labels cover signs which bound interjec-tions, tag questions, and reported speech and a class denoting false signs of syntactic complex-ity, such as use of the word that as a specifier or anaphor.",
        "The class labels are a combination of the following acronyms: 2 http://clg.wlv.ac.uk/resources/ SignsOfSyntacticComplexity/ 1.",
        "{C|SS|ES}, the generic function as a coordinator (C), the left boundary of a subordinate constituent (SS), or the right boundary of a subordinate constituent (ES).",
        "2.",
        "{P |L|I|M |E}, the syntactic projection level of the constituent(s): prefix (P), lexical (L), intermediate (I), maximal (M), or extended/-clausal (E).",
        "3.",
        "{A|Adv|N |P |Q|V }, the grammatical category of the constituent(s): adjectival (A), adverbial (Adv), nominal (N), prepositional (P), quantificational (Q), and verbal (V).",
        "4.",
        "{1|2}, used to further differentiate subclasses on the basis of some other label-specific criterion.",
        "The scheme uses a total of 42 labels to distinguish between different syntactic functions of the bounded constituents.",
        "Although signs are marked by a small set of tokens (words and punctuation), the high number of labels and their skewed distribution make signs highly ambiguous.",
        "In addi-tion, each sign is only assigned exactly one label, i.e. that of the dominant constituent in the case of nesting, further increasing ambiguity.",
        "These characteristics make automatic classification of signs challenging.",
        "The automatic classification of signs of syntactic complexity is achieved using a machine learning approach described in more detail in Dornescu et al. (2013).",
        "After experimenting with several methods of representing the training data and with several classifiers, the best results were obtained by using the BIO model to train a CRF tagger.",

        "rived from the manually annotated data (Oracle) and from use of the automatic classifier (Classi- fier).",
        "Table 3a presents the accuracy of the rules implemented to convert compound sentences into a more accessible form.",
        "The row #Compound sentences displays the number of sentences in the test data that contain signs of conjoint clauses (signs of class CEV).",
        "The results obtained are not unexpected.",
        "In all cases the accuracy of the simplification rules is higher when the labels of signs are assigned by the oracle.",
        "With the exception of the health domain, the same pattern is observed when ?Flesch is considered.",
        "The highest accuracy is obtained on the news texts, then the health do-main, and finally the literature domain.",
        "However, despite significantly lower accuracy on the literature domain, the readability of the sentences from the literature domain benefits most from the automatic simplification.",
        "This can be noticed both in the improved Flesch scores and reduced sentence length.",
        "Table 3b presents the accuracy of the rules which simplify complex sentences.",
        "In this table, #Complex sentences denotes the number of sentences in the test data that contain relative clauses.",
        "The rest of the measures are calculated in the same way as in Table 3a.",
        "Inspection of the table shows that, for the news and health domains, the accuracy of these simplification rules is significantly lower than the simplification rules used for compound sentences.",
        "Surprisingly, the rules work better for the literature domain than for the others.",
        "The improvement in the readability of texts from the health domain is negligible, which can be explained by the poor performance of the simplification rules on this domain.",
        "137 4.3 Error analysis In order to have a better understanding of the performance of the system, the performance of the individual rules was also recorded.",
        "Tables 4 and 5 contain the most error prone trigger patterns for conjoined and subordinate clauses respectively.",
        "The statistics were derived from rules applied to texts of all three categories of texts and the signs of syntactic complexity were classified using an oracle, in order to isolate the influence of the rules in the system output.",
        "In this context, the accuracy with which the syntactic processor converts sentences containing conjoint clauses into a more accessible form is 0.577.",
        "The accuracy of this task with regard to subordinate clauses is 0.411.",
        "The most error-prone trigger patterns for conjoined clauses are listed in Table 4, together with information on the conjoin that they are intended to detect (left or right), their error rate, and the number of number of errors made.",
        "The same information is presented for the rules converting sentences containing subordinate clauses in Table 5, but in this case the patterns capture the subordination relations.",
        "In the patterns, words with particular parts of speech are denoted by the symbol w with the relevant Penn Treebank tag appended as a subscript.",
        "Verbs with clause complements are denoted v CC .",
        "Signs of syntactic complexity are denoted by the symbol s with the abbreviation of the functional class appended as a subscript.",
        "Specific words are printed in italics.",
        "In the patterns, the clause coordinator is denoted ?",
        "?",
        "and upper case letters are used to denote stretches of contiguous text.",
        "Rules CEV-25a and SSEV-78a are applied when the input sentence triggers none of the other implemented patterns.",
        "Errors of this type quantify the number of sentences containing conjoint or subordinate clauses that cannot be converted into a more accessible form by rules included in the structural complexity processor.",
        "Both rules have quite high error rates, but these errors can only be addressed via the addition of new rules or the adjustment of already implemented rules.",
        "SSEV-36a is a pattern used to prevent processing of sentences that contain verbs with clause complements.",
        "This pattern was introduced because using the sentence rewriting algorithm proposed here to process sentences containing these subordinate clauses would generate ungrammatical output.",
        "Table 5 contains only 4 items because for the rest of the patterns the number of errors was less than 3.",
        "A large number of these rules had an error rate of 1 which motivated their deactivation.",
        "Unfortunately this did not lead to improved accuracy of the overall conversion process.",
        "5 Conclusions and future work Error analysis revealed that fully automatic conversion compound and complex sentences into a more accessible form is quite unreliable, particularly for texts of the literature category.",
        "It was noted that conversion of complex sentences into a more accessible form is more difficult than conversion of compound sentences.",
        "However, subordinate clauses are significantly more prevalent than conjoint clauses in the training and testing data collected so far.",
        "The evaluation of the rule sets used in the conversion of compound and complex sentences into a more accessible form motivates further specific development of the rule sets.",
        "This process includes deletion of rules that do not meet particular thresholds for accuracy and the development of new rules to address cases where input sentences fail to trigger any conversion rules (signalled by activation of redundant rules CEV-25a and SSEV-78a).",
        "The results are disappointing given that the syntactic simplification module presented in this paper is expected to be integrated in a system that makes texts more accessible for people with autism.",
        "However, this simplification module will be included in a post-editing environment for people with ASD.",
        "In this setting, it may still prove useful, despite its low accuracy.",
