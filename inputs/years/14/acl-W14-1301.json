        "User-generated content (UGC), and specially the microblog genre, has become an interesting resource for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools and applications.",
        "Many are the advantages of exploiting this real-time stream of multilingual textual data.",
        "Popular applications such as Twitter has an heterogeneous user base of almost 600 million users that generate more than 60 million new tweets every day.",
        "For this reason, Twitter has become one of the most used sources of textual data for NLP with several applications such as sentiment analysis (Tumasjan et al., 2010) or realtime event detection (Sakaki et al., 2010).",
        "Recent advances on machine translation or information retrieval systems have been also making an extensive use of UGC for both training and evaluation purposes.",
        "However, tweets can be very noisy and sometimes hard to understand for both humans (Mosquera et al., 2012) and NLP applications (Wang and Ng, 2013), so an additional preprocessing step is usually required.",
        "There have been different perceptions regarding the lexical quality of social media (Rello and Baeza-Yates, 2012) (Baldwin et al., 2013) and even others suggested that 40% of the messages of Twitter were ?pointless babble?",
        "(PearAnalyt- ics, 2009).",
        "Most of the out of vocabulary (OOV) words present in social media texts can be catalogued as lexical variants (e.g. ?See u 2moro?",
        "?",
        "?See you tomorrow?",
        "), that are words lexically related with their canonic form.",
        "The use of text normalisation techniques has been proven useful in order to clean short and informal texts such as tweets.",
        "However, the evaluation of these systems requires annotated data, which usually involves costly human annotations.",
        "There are previous works about automatically constructing normalisation dictionaries, but until now, most of these approaches have been focused on English and they were not taking into account demographic variants.",
        "In this paper we describe the methodology used for automatically mining lexical variants from English and Spanish tweets associated to a set of headwords.",
        "These formal and informal pairs can be later used to train and evaluate existing social media text normalisation systems.",
        "Additional metadata from Twitter such as geographic location and user gender is also col-lected, opening the possibility to model and analyse gender or location-specific variants.",
        "This paper is organised as follows.",
        "We describe the related work in Section 2.",
        "We then describe our variant mining methodology in Section 3.",
        "The obtained results are presented in Section 4.",
        "Section 5, draws the conclusions and future work.",
        "1 2 Related Work One way to handle the performance drop of NLP tools on user-generated content (Foster et al., 2011) is to re-train existing models on these informal genres (Gimpel et al., 2011), (Liu et al., 2011b).",
        "Another approaches make use of preprocessing techniques such as text normalisation in order to minimise the social media textual noise (Han et al., 2013), (Mosquera and Moreda, 2012) where OOV words were first identified and then substituted using lexical and phonetic edit distances.",
        "In order to enhance both precision and recall both OOV detection and translation dictionaries were used.",
        "Moreover, the creative nature of informal writing and the low availability of manually-annotated corpora can make the improvement and evaluation of these systems challenging.",
        "Motivated by the lack of annotated data and the large amount of OOV words contained in Twitter, several approaches for automatically constructing a lexical normalisation dictionary were pro-posed; In (Gouws et al., 2011) a normalisation lexicon is generated based on distributional and string similarity (Lodhi et al., 2002) from Twitter.",
        "Using a similar technique, a wider-coverage dictionary is constructed in (Han et al., 2012) based on contextually-similar (OOV, IV) pairs.",
        "More recently, (Hassan and Menezes, 2013) introduced another context-based approach using random walks on a contextual similarity graph.",
        "Distributional-based methods can have some drawbacks: they rely heavily on pairwise comparisons that make them computationally expen-sive, and as the normalisation candidates are selected based on context similarity they can be sensitive to domain-specific variants that share similar contexts.",
        "Moreover, these approaches were focusing on extracting English lexical variants from social media texts, but due the heterogeneity of its users, lexical distributions can be influenced by geographical factors (Eisenstein et al., 2010) or even gender (Thomson and Murachver, 2001).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, there are not multilingual approaches for mining lexical variants from short, noisy texts that also take into account demographic variables.",
        "For this reason, we present an unsupervised method for mining English and Spanish lexical variants from Twitter that collects demographic and contextual information.",
        "These obtained pairs can be later used for training and evaluating text normalisation and inverse text normalisation systems.",
        "3 Lexical Variant Mining Lexical variants are typically formed from their standard forms through regular processes (Thur- low and Brown, 2003) and these can be modelled by using a set of basic character transformation rules such as letter insertion, deletion or substitution (Liu et al., 2011a) e.g. (?tmrrw?",
        "?",
        "?2morrow?)",
        "and combination of these (?2moro?).",
        "The relation between formal and informal pairs is not always 1-to-1, two different formal words can share the same lexical variant (?t?",
        "in Spanish can represent ?te?",
        "or ?t?u?)",
        "and one formal word can have many different variants (e.g. ?see you?",
        "us commonly shortened as ?c ya?",
        "or ?see u?).",
        "As a difference with previous approaches based on contextual and distributional similarity, we have chosen to model the generation of variant candidates from a set of headwords using transformation rules.",
        "These candidates are later validated based on their presence on a popular microblog service, used in this case as a high-coverage corpus.",
        "3.1 Candidate Generation We have defined a set of 6 basic transformation rules (see Table 1) in order to automatically generate candidate lexical variants from the 300k most frequent words of Web 1T 5-gram (En- glish) (Brants and Franz, 2006) and SUBTLEX-SP (Spanish) (Cuetos et al., 2011) corpora.",
