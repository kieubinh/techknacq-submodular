        "Before buying a product or service, consumers often search the Web for expert reviews, but increasingly also for opinions of other consumers, expressed in blogs, social networks etc.",
        "Many useful opinions are expressed in text-only form (e.g., in tweets).",
        "It is then desirable to extract aspects (e.g., screen, battery) from the texts that discuss a particular entity (e.g., a smartphone), i.e., figure out what is being discussed, and also estimate aspect sentiment scores, i.e., how positive or negative the (usually average) sentiment for each aspect is.",
        "These two goals are jointly known as Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) (Liu, 2012).",
        "In this paper, we consider free text customer reviews of products and services; ABSA, however, is also applicable to texts about other kinds of entities (e.g., politicians, organizations).",
        "We assume that a search engine retrieves customer reviews about a particular target entity (product or Figure 1: Automatically extracted prominent aspects (shown as clusters of aspect terms) and average aspect sentiment scores of a target entity.",
        "service), that multiple reviews written by different customers are retrieved for each target entity, and that the ultimate goal is to produce a table like the one of Fig. 1, which presents the most prominent aspects and average aspect sentiment scores of the target entity.",
        "Most ABSA systems in effect perform all or some of the following three subtasks: Aspect term extraction: Starting from texts about a particular target entity or entities of the same type as the target entity (e.g., laptop re-views), this stage extracts and possibly ranks by importance aspect terms, i.e., terms naming aspects (e.g., ?battery?, ?screen?)",
        "of the target en-tity, including multi-word terms (e.g., ?hard disk?)",
        "(Liu, 2012; Long et al., 2010; Snyder and Barzi-lay, 2007; Yu et al., 2011).",
        "At the end of this stage, each aspect term is taken to be the name of a different aspect, but aspect terms may subsequently be clustered during aspect aggregation; see below.",
        "Aspect term sentiment estimation: This stage estimates the polarity and possibly also the intensity (e.g., strongly negative, mildly positive) of the opinions for each aspect term of the target entity, usually averaged over several texts.",
        "Classifying texts by sentiment polarity is a popular research topic (Liu, 2012; Pang and Lee, 2005; Tsytsarau and Palpanas, 2012).",
        "The goal, however, in this 44 ABSA subtask is to estimate the (usually average) polarity and intensity of the opinions about particular aspect terms of the target entity.",
        "Aspect aggregation: Some systems group aspect terms that are synonyms or near-synonyms (e.g., ?price?, ?cost?)",
        "or, more generally, cluster aspect terms to obtain aspects of a coarser granularity (e.g., ?chicken?, ?steak?, and ?fish?",
        "may all be replaced by ?food?)",
        "(Liu, 2012; Long et al., 2010; Zhai et al., 2010; Zhai et al., 2011).",
        "A polarity (and intensity) score can then be computed for each coarser aspect (e.g., ?food?)",
        "by combining (e.g., averaging) the polarity scores of the aspect terms that belong in the coarser aspect.",
        "In this paper, we focus on aspect term extraction (ATE).",
        "Our contribution is threefold.",
        "Firstly, we argue (Section 2) that previous ATE datasets are not entirely satisfactory, mostly because they contain reviews from a particular domain only (e.g., consumer electronics), or they contain reviews for very few target entities, or they do not contain annotations for aspect terms.",
        "We constructed and make publicly available three new ATE datasets with customer reviews for a much larger number of target entities from three domains (restaurants, laptops, hotels), with gold annotations of all the aspect term occurrences; we also measured inter-annotator agreement, unlike previous datasets.",
        "Secondly, we argue (Section 3) that commonly used evaluation measures are also not entirely satisfactory.",
        "For example, when precision, recall, and F -measure are computed over distinct aspect terms (types), equal weight is assigned to more and less frequent aspect terms, whereas frequently discussed aspect terms are more impor-tant; and when precision, recall, and F -measure are computed over aspect term occurrences (to- kens), methods that identify very few, but very frequent aspect terms may appear to perform much better than they actually do.",
        "We propose weighted variants of precision and recall, which take into account the rankings of the distinct aspect terms that are obtained when the distinct aspect terms are ordered by their true and predicted frequencies.",
        "We also compute the average weighted precision over several weighted recall levels.",
        "Thirdly, we show (Section 4) how the popular unsupervised ATE method of Hu and Liu (2004), can be extended with continuous space word vectors (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Mikolov et al., 2013b; Mikolov et al., 2013c).",
        "Using our datasets and evaluation measures, we demonstrate (Section 5) that the extended method performs better.",
        "2 Datasets We first discuss previous datasets that have been used for ATE, and we then introduce our own.",
        "2.1 Previous datasets So far, ATE methods have been evaluated mainly on customer reviews, often from the consumer electronics domain (Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Ding et al., 2008).",
        "The most commonly used dataset is that of Hu and Liu (2004), which contains reviews of only five particular electronic products (e.g., Nikon Coolpix 4300).",
        "Each sentence is annotated with aspect terms, but inter-annotator agreement has not been reported.",
        "1 All the sentences appear to have been selected to express clear positive or negative opinions.",
        "There are no sentences expressing conflicting opinions about aspect terms (e.g., ?The screen is clear but small?",
        "), nor are there any sentences that do not express opinions about their aspect terms (e.g., ?It has a 4.8-inch screen?).",
        "Hence, the dataset is not entirely representative of product reviews.",
        "By contrast, our datasets, discussed below, contain reviews from three domains, including sentences that express conflicting or no opinions about aspect terms, they concern many more target entities (not just five), and we have also measured inter-annotator agreement.",
        "The dataset of Ganu et al. (2009), on which one of our datasets is based, is also popular.",
        "In the original dataset, each sentence is tagged with coarse aspects (?food?, ?service?, ?price?, ?ambi- ence?, ?anecdotes?, or ?miscellaneous?).",
        "For exam-ple, ?The restaurant was expensive, but the menu was great?",
        "would be tagged with the coarse aspects ?price?",
        "and ?food?.",
        "The coarse aspects, how-ever, are not necessarily terms occurring in the sentence, and it is unclear how they were obtained.",
        "By contrast, we asked human annotators to mark the explicit aspect terms of each sentence, leaving the task of clustering the terms to produce coarser aspects for an aspect aggregation stage.",
        "The ?Concept-Level Sentiment Analysis Chal-lenge?",
        "of ESWC 2014 uses the dataset of Blitzer et al. (2007), which contains customer reviews of 1 Each aspect term occurrence is also annotated with a sentiment score.",
        "We do not discuss these scores here, since we focus on ATE.",
        "The same comment applies to the dataset of Ganu et al. (2009) and our datasets.",
        "45 DVDs, books, kitchen appliances, and electronic products, with an overall sentiment score for each review.",
        "One of the challenge's tasks requires systems to extract the aspects of each sentence and a sentiment score (positive or negative) per aspect.",
        "2 The aspects are intended to be concepts from on-tologies, not simply aspect terms.",
        "The ontologies to be used, however, are not fully specified and no training dataset with sentences and gold aspects is currently available.",
        "Overall, the previous datasets are not entirely satisfactory, because they contain reviews from a particular domain only, or reviews for very few target entities, or their sentences are not entirely representative of customer reviews, or they do not contain annotations for aspect terms, or no inter-annotator agreement has been reported.",
        "To address these issues, we provide three new ATE datasets, which contain customer reviews of restaurants, hotels, and laptops, respectively.",
        "3 2.2 Our datasets The restaurants dataset contains 3,710 English sentences from the reviews of Ganu et al. (2009).",
        "4 We asked human annotators to tag the aspect terms of each sentence.",
        "In ?The dessert was divine?, for example, the annotators would tag the aspect term ?dessert?.",
        "In a sentence like ?The restaurant was expensive, but the menu was great?, the annotators were instructed to tag only the explicitly mentioned aspect term ?menu?.",
        "The sentence also refers to the prices, and a possibility would be to add ?price?",
        "as an implicit aspect term, but we do not consider implicit aspect terms in this paper.",
        "We used nine annotators for the restaurant reviews.",
        "Each sentence was processed by a single annotator, and each annotator processed approximately the same number of sentences.",
        "Among the 3,710 restaurant sentences, 1,248 contain exactly one aspect term, 872 more than one, and 1,590 no aspect terms.",
        "There are 593 distinct multi-word aspect terms and 452 distinct single-word aspect terms.",
        "Removing aspect terms that occur only once leaves 67 distinct multi-word and 195 distinct single-word aspect terms.",
        "The hotels dataset contains 3,600 English sen-2 See http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/.",
        "3 Our datasets are available upon request.",
        "The datasets of the ABSA task of SemEval 2014 (http://alt.qcri.",
        "org/semeval2014/task4/) are based on our datasets.",
        "4 The original dataset of Ganu et al. contains 3,400 sen-tences, but some of the sentences had not been properly split.",
        "tences from online customer reviews of 30 hotels.",
        "We used three annotators.",
        "Among the 3,600 hotel sentences, 1,326 contain exactly one aspect term, 652 more than one, and 1,622 none.",
        "There are 199 distinct multi-word aspect terms and 262 distinct single-word aspect terms, of which 24 and 120, respectively, were tagged more than once.",
        "The laptops dataset contains 3,085 English sentences of 394 online customer reviews.",
        "A single annotator (one of the authors) was used.",
        "Among the 3,085 laptop sentences, 909 contain exactly one aspect term, 416 more than one, and 1,760 none.",
        "There are 350 distinct multi-word and 289 distinct single-word aspect terms, of which 67 and 137, respectively, were tagged more than once.",
        "To measure inter-annotator agreement, we used a sample of 75 restaurant, 75 laptop, and 100 hotel sentences.",
        "Each sentence was processed by two (for restaurants and laptops) or three (for hotels) annotators, other than the annotators used previously.",
        "For each sentence s i , the inter-annotator agreement was measured as the Dice coefficient D i = 2 ?",
        "|A i ?B i | |A i |+|B i | , where A i , B i are the sets of aspect term occurrences tagged by the two anno-tators, respectively, and |S| denotes the cardinality of a set S; for hotels, we use the mean pair-wiseD i of the three annotators.",
        "5 The overall inter-annotator agreement D was taken to be the average D i of the sentences of each sample.",
        "We, thus, obtainedD = 0.72, 0.70, 0.69, for restaurants, ho-tels, and laptops, respectively, which indicate reasonably high inter-annotator agreement.",
        "2.3 Single and multi-word aspect terms ABSA systems use ATE methods ultimately to obtain the m most prominent (frequently discussed) distinct aspect terms of the target entity, for different values of m. 6 In a system like the one of Fig. 1, for example, if we ignore aspect aggrega-tion, each row will report the average sentiment score of a single frequent distinct aspect term, and m will be the number of rows, which may depend on the display size or user preferences.",
        "Figure 2 shows the percentage of distinct multi-word aspect terms among themmost frequent distinct aspect terms, for different values of m, in 5 Cohen's Kappa cannot be used here, because the annotators may tag any word sequence of any sentence, which leads to a very large set of categories.",
        "A similar problem was reported by Kobayashi et al. (2007).",
        "6 A more general definition of prominence might also consider the average sentiment score of each distinct aspect term.",
        "46 our three datasets and the electronics dataset of Hu and Liu (2004).",
        "There are many more single-word distinct aspect terms than multi-word distinct aspect terms, especially in the restaurant and hotel reviews.",
        "In the electronics and laptops datasets, the percentage of multi-word distinct aspect terms (e.g., ?hard disk?)",
        "is higher, but most of the distinct aspect terms are still single-word, especially for small values of m. By contrast, many ATE methods (Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Wei et al., 2010) devote much of their processing to identifying multi-word aspect terms.",
        "Figure 2: Percentage of (distinct) multi-word aspect terms among the most frequent aspect terms.",
        "3 Evaluation measures We now discuss previous ATE evaluation mea-sures, also introducing our own.",
        "3.1 Precision, Recall, F-measure ATE methods are usually evaluated using preci-sion, recall, and F -measure (Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Kim and Hovy, 2006; Wei et al., 2010; Moghaddam and Ester, 2010; Bagheri et al., 2013), but it is often unclear if these measures are applied to distinct aspect terms (no duplicates) or aspect term occurrences.",
        "In the former case, each method is expected to return a set A of distinct aspect terms, to be compared to the set G of distinct aspect terms the human annotators identified in the texts.",
        "TP (true positives) is |A?G|, FP (false positives) is |A\\G|, FN (false negatives) is |G\\A|, and precision (P ), recall (R), F = 2?P ?R P+R are defined as usually: P = TP TP + FP , R = TP TP + FN (1) This way, however, precision, recall, and F measure assign the same importance to all the distinct aspect terms, whereas missing, for example, a more frequent (more frequently discussed) distinct aspect term should probably be penalized more heavily than missing a less frequent one.",
        "When precision, recall, and F -measure are applied to aspect term occurrences (Liu et al., 2005), TP is the number of aspect term occurrences tagged (each term occurrence) both by the method being evaluated and the human annotators, FP is the number of aspect term occurrences tagged by the method but not the human annotators, and FN is the number of aspect term occurrences tagged by the human annotators but not the method.",
        "The three measures are then defined as above.",
        "They now assign more importance to frequently occurring distinct aspect terms, but they can produce misleadingly high scores when only a few, but very frequent distinct aspect terms are handled correctly.",
        "Furthermore, the occurrence-based definitions do not take into account that missing several aspect term occurrences or wrongly tagging expressions as aspect term occurrences may not actually matter, as long as the m most frequent distinct aspect terms can be correctly reported.",
        "3.2 Weighted precision, recall, AWP What the previous definitions of precision and recall miss is that in practice ABSA systems use ATE methods ultimately to obtain the m most frequent distinct aspect terms, for a range of m values.",
        "Let A m and G m be the lists that contain the m most frequent distinct aspect terms, ordered by their predicted and true frequencies, respectively; the predicted and true frequencies are computed by examining how frequently the ATE method or the human annotators, respectively, tagged occurrences of each distinct aspect term.",
        "Differences between the predicted and true frequencies do not matter, as long as A m = G m , for every m. Not including in A m a term of G m should be penalized more or less heavily, depending on whether the term's true frequency was high or low, respectively.",
        "Furthermore, including in A m a term not in G m should be penalized more or less heavily, depending on whether the term was placed towards the beginning or the end of A m , i.e., depending on the prominence that was assigned to the term.",
        "To address the issues discussed above, we introduce weighted variants of precision and recall.",
        "47 For each ATE method, we now compute a single list A = ?",
        "a 1 , .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", a |A| ?",
        "of distinct aspect terms identified by the method, ordered by decreasing predicted frequency.",
        "For every m value (number of most frequent distinct aspect terms to show), the method is treated as having returned the sub-list A m with the first m elements of A.",
        "Similarly, we now take G = ?",

        ", g |G| ?",

        "The denominator of Eq. 3 sums the weights of all the terms of G; in unweighted recall applied to distinct aspect terms, where all the terms of G have the same weight, the denominator would be |G| = TP + FN (Eq. 1).",
        "WP m counts how many gold aspect terms the method returned in A m , but weighting each returned term a i by its inverse ranking 1 i in A m , to reward methods that return more gold aspect terms towards the beginning of A m .",
        "The denominator of Eq. 2 sums the weights of all the terms ofA m ; in unweighted precision applied to distinct aspect terms, the denominator would be |A m | = TP + FN (Eq. 1).",
        "We plot weighted precision-recall curves by computingWP m ,WR m pairs for different values of m, as in Fig. 3 below.",

        "We also compute the average (interpolated) weighted precision 7 In our experiments, we exclude from G aspect terms tagged by the annotators only once.",
        "8 With supervised methods, we perform a 10-fold cross-validation for each m, and we macro-average WP m ,WR m over the folds.",

        "In the work of Yu et al., t(i) = 1 if the term at position i is not important (as judged by a human), t(i) = 2 if the term is ?ordinary?, and t(i) = 3 if it is important.",
        "The logarithm is used to reduce the reward for distinct aspect terms placed at lower positions of the returned list.",
        "The nDCG@mmeasure is well known in ranking systems (e.g., search engines) and it is similar to our weighted precision (WP m ).",
        "The denominator or Eq. 2 corresponds to the normalization factor Z of nDCG@m; the 1 i factor of in the numerator of Eq. 2 corresponds to the 1 log 2 (1+i) degradation factor of nDCG@m; and the 1{a i ?",
        "G} factor of Eq. 2 is a binary reward function, corresponding to the 2 t(i) ?",
        "1 factor of nDCG@m. The main difference from nDCG@m is that WP m uses a degradation factor 1 i that is inversely proportional to the ranking of the returned term a i in the returned list A m , whereas nDCG@m uses a logarithmic factor 1 log 2 (1+i) , which reduces less sharply the reward for distinct aspect terms returned at lower positions in A m .",
        "We believe that the degradation factor of WP m is more appropriate for ABSA, because most users would in practice wish to view sentiment scores for only a few (e.g., m = 10) frequent distinct aspect terms, whereas in search engines users are more likely to examine more of the highly-ranked returned items.",
        "It is possible, however, to use a logarithmic degradation factor inWP m , as in nDCG@m. 48 Another difference is that we use a binary reward factor 1{a i ?",

        "With a binary reward factor, nDCG@m in effect measures the ratio of correct (distinct) aspect terms to the terms returned, assigning more weight to correct aspect terms placed closer the top of the returned list, like WP m .",

        "We also compute the average weighted precision (AWP ), which is a combination ofWP m andWR m , for a range of m values.",
        "4 Aspect term extraction methods We implemented and evaluated four ATE meth-ods: (i) a popular baseline (dubbed FREQ) that returns the most frequent distinct nouns and noun phrases, (ii) the well-known method of Hu and Liu (2004), which adds to the baseline pruning mechanisms and steps that detect more aspect terms (dubbed H&L), (iii) an extension of the previous method (dubbed H&L+W2V), with an extra pruning step we devised that uses the recently popular continuous space word vectors (Mikolov et al., 2013c), and (iv) a similar extension of FREQ (dubbed FREQ+W2V).",
        "All four methods are unsu-pervised, which is particularly important for ABSA systems intended to be used across domains with minimal changes.",
        "They return directly a list A of distinct aspect terms ordered by decreasing predicted frequency, rather than tagging aspect term occurrences, which would require computing the A list from the tagged occurrences before applying our evaluation measures (Section 3.2).",
        "4.1 The FREQ baseline The FREQ baseline returns the most frequent (dis- tinct) nouns and noun phrases of the reviews in each dataset (restaurants, hotels, laptops), ordered by decreasing sentence frequency (how many sentences contain the noun or noun phrase).",
        "9 This is a reasonably effective and popular baseline (Hu and Liu, 2004; Wei et al., 2010; Liu, 2012).",
        "4.2 The H&L method The method of Hu and Liu (2004), dubbed H&L, first extracts all the distinct nouns and noun phrases from the reviews of each dataset (lines 3?",

        "10 It then forms longer candidate distinct aspect terms by concatenating pairs and triples of candidate aspect terms occurring in the same sentence, in the order they appear in the sentence (lines 7?11).",
