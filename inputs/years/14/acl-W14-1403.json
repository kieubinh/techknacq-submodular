        "In this paper we discuss a conservative extension of the simply-typed lambda calculus in order to model a class of expressions that generalize the notion of opaque contexts.",
        "Our extension is based on previous work in the semantics of programming languages aimed at providing a mathematical characterization of computations that produce some kind of side effect (Moggi, 1989), and is based on the notion of mon-ads, a construction in category theory that, intuitively, maps a collection of ?simple?",
        "values and ?simple?",
        "functions into a more complex value space, in a canonical way.",
        "The main advantages of our approach with respect to traditional analyses of opacity are the fact that we are able to explain in a uniform way a set of different but related phenomena, and that we do so in a principled way that has been shown to also explain other linguistic phenomena (Shan, 2001)."

        "Opaque contexts have been an active area of research in natural language semantics since Frege's original discussion of the puzzle (Frege, 1892).",
        "A sentence like (1) has a non-contradictory interpretation despite the fact that the two referring expressions Hesperus and Phosphorus refer to the same entity, the planet we know as Venus.",
        "(1) Reza doesn't believe Hesperus is Phosphorus.",
        "The fact that a sentence like (1) includes the modal believe has influenced much of the analyses proposed in the literature, and has linked the phenomenon with the notion of modality.",
        "In this paper we challenge this view and try to position data like (1) inside a larger framework that also includes other types of expressions.",
        "We decompose examples like (1) along two di-mensions: the presence or absence of a modal ex-pression, and the way in which we multiply refer to the same individual.",
        "In the case of (1), we have a modal and we use two different co-referring expressions.",
        "Examples (2)-(4) complete the landscape of possible combinations: (2) Dr. Octopus punched Spider-Man but he didn't punch Spider-Man.",
        "(3) Mary Jane loves Peter Parker but she doesn't love Spider-Man.",
        "(4) Reza doesn't believe Jesus is Jesus.",
        "(2) is clearly a contradictory statement, as we predicate of Dr. Octopus that he has the property of having punched Spider-Man and its negation.",
        "Notice that in this example there is no modal and the exact same expression is used twice to refer to the object individual.",
        "In the case of (3) we still have no modal and we use two different but co-referring expressions to refer to the same individual.",
        "However in this case the statement has a non-contradictory reading.",
        "Similarly (4) has a non-contradictory reading, which states that, according to the speaker, Reza doesn't believe that the entity he (Reza) calls Jesus is the entity that the speaker calls Jesus (e.g., is not the same individual or does not have the same properties).",
        "This case is symmetrical to (3), as here we have a modal expression but the same expression is used twice to refer to the same individual.",
        "If the relevant reading of (4) is difficult to get, consider an alternative kind of scenario, as in (5), in which the subject of the sentence, Kim, suffers from Capgras Syndrome 1 and thinks that Sandy is an impostor.",
        "The speaker says: 1 From Wikipedia: ?",
        "[Capgras syndrome] is a disorder in which a person holds a delusion that a friend, spouse, par-19 (5) Kim doesn't believe Sandy is Sandy Given the definition of Capgras Syndrome (in fn.",
        "1), there is a clear non-contradictory reading available here, in which the speaker is stating that Kim does not believe that the entity in question, that the speaker and (other non-Capgras-sufferers) would call Sandy, is the entity that she associate with the name Sandy.",
        "We propose an analysis of the non-contradictory cases based on the intuition that the apparently co-referential expressions are in fact interpreted using different interpretation functions, which correspond to different perspectives that are pitted against each other in the sentences.",
        "Furthermore, we propose that modal expressions are not the only ones capable of introducing a shift of perspective, but also that verbs that involve some kind of mental attitude of the subject towards the object have the same effect.",
        "Notice that this last observation distinguishes our approach from one where a sentence like (3) is interpreted as simply saying that Mary Jane loves only one guise of the entity that corresponds to Peter Parker but not another one.",
        "The problem with this interpretation is that if it is indeed the case that different co-referring expressions simply pick out different guises of the same individual, then a sentence like (6) should have a non-contradictory reading, while this seems not to be the case.",
        "(6) Dr. Octopus killed Spider-Man but he didn't kill Peter Parker.",
        "While a guise-based interpretation is compatible with our analysis 2 , it is also necessary to correctly model the different behaviour of verbs like love with respect to others like punch or kill.",
        "In fact, we need to model the difference between, for ex-ample, kill and murder, since murder does involve a mental attitude of intention and the corresponding sentence to (6) is not necessarily contradictory: (7) Dr. Octopus murdered Spider-Man but he didn't murder Peter Parker.",
        "The implementation of our analysis is based on monads.",
        "Monads are a construction in category theory that defines a canonical way to map a set of objects and functions that we may consider as ent, or other close family member has been replaced by an identical-looking impostor.?",
        "2 Indeed, one way to understand guises is as different ways in which we interpret a referring term (Heim, 1998).",
        "simple into a more complex object and function space.",
        "They have been successfully used in the semantics of programming languages to characterise computations that are not ?pure?.",
        "By pure we mean code objects that are totally referentially transparent (i.e. do not depend on external factors and return the same results given the same input independently of their execution context), and also that do not have effects on the ?real world?.",
        "In contrast, monads are used to model computations that for example read from or write to a file, that depend on some random process or whose return value is non-deterministic.",
        "In our case we will use the monad that describe values that are made dependent on some external factor, commonly known in the functional programming literature as the Reader monad.",
        "3 We will represent linguistic expressions that can be assigned potentially different interpretations as functions from interpretation indices to values.",
        "Effectively we will construct a different type of lexicon that does not represent only the linguistic knowledge of a single speaker but also her (possibly par-tial) knowledge of the language of other speakers.",
        "So, for example, we will claim that (4) can be assigned a non-contradictory reading because the speaker's lexicon also includes the information regarding Reza's interpretation of the name Jesus and therefore makes it possible for the speaker to use the same expression, in combination with a verb such as believe, to actually refer to two different entities.",
        "In one case we will argue that the name Jesus is interpreted using the speaker's interpretation while in the other case it is Reza's interpretation that is used.",
        "Notice that we can apply our analysis to any natural language expression that may have different interpretations.",
        "This means that, for exam-ple, we can extend our analysis, which is limited to referring expressions here for space reasons, to other cases, such as the standard examples involving ideally synonymous predicates like groundhog and woodchuck (see, e.g., Fox and Lappin (2005)).",
        "The paper is organised as follows: in section 2 we discuss the technical details of our analysis; in section 3 we discuss our analyses of the motivating examples; section 4 compares our approach with a standard approach to opacity; we conclude in section 5.",

        "More generally, there are again three non-equivalent readings, including the one above, which are just those in figure 4, with JJesusK replaced by JSandyK and JRezaK replaced by JKimK.",
        "7 Again, there are six readings that correspond to different proofs, but given the commutative behaviour of the Reader monad, the fact that equality is commutative, and the fact that we have in this case two identical lexical items, only three of them are non-equivalent readings.",
        "4 Comparison with traditional approaches In this section we try to sketch how a traditional approach to opaque contexts, such as one based on a de dicto/de re ambiguity with respect to a modal operator, would fare in the analysis of (4), our most challenging example.",
        "To try to explain the two readings in the context of a standard possible worlds semantics, we could take (4) to be ambiguous with respect to a de dicto/de re reading.",
        "In the case of the de dicto reading (which corresponds to the non-satisfiable reading) the two names are evaluated under the scope of the doxastic operator believe, i.e. they both refer to the same entity that is assigned to the name Jesus in each accessible world.",
        "Clearly this is always the case, and so (4) is not satisfiable.",
        "In the case of the de re reading, we assume that the two names are evaluated at different worlds that assign different referents to the two names.",
        "One of these two worlds will be the actual world and the other one of the accesible worlds.",
        "The reading is satisfiable if the doxastic modality links the actual world with one in which the name Jesus refers to a different entity.",
        "Notice that for this analysis to work we need to make two assumptions: 1. that names behave as quantifiers with the property of escaping modal contexts, 2. that names can be assigned different referents in different worlds, i.e. we have to abandon the standard notion that names are rigid designators (Kripke, 1972).",
        "In contrast, in our approach we do not need to abandon the idea of rigid designation for names (within each 25 agent's model).",
        "However, such an approach would present a number of rather serious problems.",
        "The first is connected with the assumption that names are scopeless.",
        "This is a common hypothesis in natural language semantics and indeed if we model names as generalized quantifiers they can be proven to be scopeless (Zimmermann, 1993).",
        "But this is problematic for our example.",
        "In fact we would predict that both instances of the name Jesus escape the scope of believe.",
        "The resulting reading would bind the quantified individual to the interpretation of Jesus in the actual world.",
        "In this way we only capture the non-satisfiable reading.",
        "To save the scopal approach we would need to assume that names in fact are sometimes interpreted in the scope of modal operators.",
        "One way to do this would be to set up our semantic derivations so that they allow different scopal relations between quantifiers and other operators.",
        "The problem with this solution is that for sentences like (4) we generate twelve different deriva-tions, some of which do not correspond to valid readings of the sentence.",
        "Even assuming that we find a satisfactory solution for these problems, the scopal approach cannot really capture the intuitions behind opacity in all contexts.",
        "Consider again (4) and assume that there are two views about Jesus: Jesus as a divine being and Jesus as a human being.",
        "Assume that Jesus is a human being in the actual world and that Reza is an atheist, then the only possible reading is the non-satisfiable one, as the referent for Jesus will be the same in the actual world and all accessible Reza-belief-worlds.",
        "The problem is that the scopal approach assumes a single modal model, while in this case it seems that there are two doxastic models, Reza's model and the speaker's model, under discussion.",
        "In contrast, in our approach the relevant part of Reza's model is embedded inside the speaker's model and interpretation indices indicate which interpretation belongs to Reza and which to the speaker.",
        "Finally an account of modality in terms of scopal properties is necessarily limited to cases in which modal operators are present.",
        "While this may be a valid position in the case of typical intensional verbs like seek or want, it would not be clear how we could extend this approach to cases like 3, as the verb love has no clear modal connotation.",
        "Thus, the scopal approach would not be sufficiently general.",
        "5 Conclusion We started by discussing a diverse collection of expressions that share the common property of showing nontrivial referential behaviours.",
        "We have proposed a common analysis of all these expressions in terms of a combination of different interpretation contexts.",
        "We have claimed that the switch to a different interpretation context is triggered by specific lexical items, such as modal verbs but also verbs that express some kind of mental attitude of the subject of the verb towards its object.",
        "The context switch is not obligatory, as witnessed by the multiple readings that the sentences discussed seem to have.",
        "We implemented our analysis using monads.",
        "The main idea of our formal implementation is that referring expressions that have a potential dependency from an interpretation context can be implemented as functions from interpretation indices to fully interpreted values.",
        "Similarly, the linguistic triggers for context switch are implemented in the lexicon as functions that can modify the interpretation context of their arguments.",
        "Monads allow us to freely combine these ?lifted?",
        "meanings with standard ones, avoiding in this way to generalize our lexicon to the worst case.",
        "We have also seen how more traditional approaches, while capable of dealing with some of the examples we discuss, are not capable of providing a generalised explanation of the observed phenomena.",
