        "Vector space models (VSMs) represent the meanings of lexical items as vectors in a ?semantic space?.",
        "The benefit of VSMs is that they can easily be manipulated using linear algebra, allowing a degree of similarity between vectors to be computed.",
        "They rely on the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954): the idea that ?words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings?",
        "(Turney and Pantel, 2010; Erk, 2012).",
        "The construction of a suitable VSM for a particular task is highly parameterised, and there appears to be little consensus over which parameter settings to use.",
        "This paper presents a systematic study of the following parameters: ?",

        "dataset for evaluation; ?",
        "source corpus.",
        "Previous studies have been limited to investigating only a small number of parameters, and using a limited set of source corpora and tasks for evaluation (Curran and Moens, 2002a; Curran and Moens, 2002b; Curran, 2004; Grefenstette, 1994; Padó and Lapata, 2007; Sahlgren, 2006; Turney and Pantel, 2010; Schulte im Walde et al., 2013).",
        "Rohde et al. (2006) considered several weighting schemes for a large variety of tasks, while Weeds et al. (2004) did the same for similarity metrics.",
        "Stone et al. (2008) investigated the effectiveness of sub-spacing corpora, where a larger corpus is queried in order to construct a smaller sub-spaced corpus (Zelikovitz and Kogan, 2006).",
        "Blacoe and Lapata (2012) compare several types of vector representations for semantic composition tasks.",
        "The most comprehensive existing studies of VSM parameters ?",
        "encompassing window sizes, feature granularity, stopwords and dimensionality reduction ?",
        "are by Bullinaria and Levy (2007; 2012) and Lapesa and Evert (2013).",
        "Section 2 introduces the various parameters of vector space model construction.",
        "We then attempt, in Section 3, to answer some of the fundamental questions for building VSMs through a number of experiments that consider each of the selected parameters.",
        "In Section 4 we examine how these findings relate to the recent development of distributional compositional semantics (Baroni et al., 2013; Clark, 2014), where vectors for words are combined into vectors for phrases.",
        "2 Data and Parameters Two datasets have dominated the literature with respect to VSM parameters: WordSim353 (Finkel- stein et al., 2002) and the TOEFL synonym dataset 21 Dataset Pairings Words RG 65 48 MC 30 39 W353 353 437 MEN 3000 751 TOEFL 80 400 M&L10 324 314 Table 1: Datasets for evaluation (Landauer and Dumais, 1997).",
        "There is a risk that semantic similarity studies have been overfit-ting to their idiosyncracies, so in this study we evaluate on a variety of datasets: in addition to WordSim353 (W353) and TOEFL, we also use the Rubenstein & Goodenough (RG) (1965) and Miller & Charles (MC) (1991) data, as well as a much larger set of similarity ratings: the MEN dataset (Bruni et al., 2012).",
        "All these datasets consist of human similarity ratings for word pairings, except TOEFL, which consists of multiple choice questions where the task is to select the correct synonym for a target word.",
        "In Section 4 we examine our parameters in the context of distributional compositional semantics, using the evaluation dataset from Mitchell and Lapata (2010).",
        "Table 1 gives statistics for the number of words and word pairings in each of the datasets.",
        "As well as using a variety of datasets, we also consider three different corpora from which to build the vectors, varying in size and domain.",
        "These include the BNC (Burnard, 2007) (10 6 word types, 10 8 tokens) and the larger ukWaC (Baroni et al., 2009) (10 7 types, 10 9 tokens).",
        "We also include a sub-spaced Wikipedia corpus (Stone et al., 2008): for all words in the evaluation datasets, we build a subcorpus by querying the top 10-ranked Wikipedia documents using the words as search terms, resulting in a corpus with 10 6 word types and 10 7 tokens.",
        "For examining the dependency-based contexts, we include the Google Syntactic N-gram corpus (Goldberg and Orwant, 2013), with 10 7 types and 10 11 tokens.",
        "2.1 Parameters We selected the following set of parameters for in-vestigation, all of which are fundamental to vector space model construction 1 .",
        "1 Another obvious parameter would be dimensionality re-duction, which we chose not to include because it does not represent a fundamental aspect of VSM construction: dimensionality reduction relies on some original non-reduced model, and directly depends on its quality.",
        "Vector size Each component of a vector represents a context (or perhaps more accurately a ?con- textual element?, such as second word to the left of the target word).",
        "2 The number of components varies hugely in the literature, but a typical value is in the low thousands.",
        "Here we consider vector sizes ranging from 50,000 to 500,000, to see whether larger vectors lead to better performance.",
        "Context There are two main approaches to modelling context: window-based and dependency-based.",
        "For window-based methods, contexts are determined by word co-occurrences within a window of a given size, where the window simply spans a number of words occurring around instances of a target word.",
        "For dependency-based methods, the contexts are determined by word co-occurrences in a particular syntactic relation with a target word (e.g. target word dog is the subject of run, where run subj is the context).",
        "We consider different window sizes and compare window-based and dependency-based methods.",
        "Feature granularity Context words, or ?fea- tures?, are often stemmed or lemmatised.",
        "We investigate the effect of stemming and lemmatisa-tion, in particular to see whether the effect varies with corpus size.",
        "We also consider more fine-grained features in which each context word is paired with a POS tag or a lexical category from CCG (Steedman, 2000).",
        "Similarity metric A variety of metrics can be used to calculate the similarity between two vectors.",
        "We consider the similarity metrics in Table 2.",
        "Weighting Weighting schemes increase the importance of contexts that are more indicative of the meaning of the target word: the fact that cat co-occurs with purr is much more informative than its co-occurrence with the.",
        "Table 3 gives definitions of the weighting schemes considered.",
        "Stopwords, high frequency cut-off Function words and stopwords are often considered too uninformative to be suitable context words.",
        "Ignoring them not only leads to a reduction in model size and computational effort, but also to a more informative distributional vector.",
        "Hence we followed standard practice and did not use stopwords as context words (using the stoplist in NLTK (Bird et al., 2009)).",
        "The question we investigated is 2 We will use the term ?feature?",

        "3.1 Vector size The first parameter we investigate is vector size, measured by the number of features.",
        "Vectors are constructed from the BNC using a window-based method, with a window size of 5 (2 words either side of the target word).",
        "We experiment with vector sizes up to 0.5M features, which is close to the total number of context words present in the entire BNC according to our preprocessing scheme.",
        "Features are added according to frequency in the BNC, with increasingly more rare features being added.",
        "For weighting we consider both Positive Mutual Information and T-Test, which have been found to work best in previous research (Bullinaria and Levy, 2012; Curran, 2004).",
        "Similarity is computed using Cosine.",
        "23 Figure 1: Impact of vector size on performance across different datasets The results in Figure 1 show a clear trend: for both weighting schemes, performance no longer improves after around 50,000 features; in fact, for T-test weighting, and some of the datasets, performance initially declines with an increase in features.",
        "Hence we conclude that continuing to add more rare features is detrimental to performance, and that 50,000 features or less will give good performance.",
        "An added benefit of smaller vectors is the reduction in computational cost.",
        "3.2 Window size Recent studies have found that the best window size depends on the task at hand.",
        "For example, Hill et al. (2013) found that smaller windows work best for measuring similarity of concrete nouns, whereas larger window sizes work better for abstract nouns.",
        "Schulte im Walde et al. (2013) found that a large window size worked best for a compositionality dataset of German noun-noun compounds.",
        "Similar relations between window size and performance have been found for similar versus related words, as well as for similar versus associated words (Turney and Pantel, 2010).",
        "We experiment with window sizes of 3, 5, 7, 9 and a full sentence.",
        "(A window size of n implies n?1 2 words either side of the target word.)",
        "We use Positive Mutual Information weighting, Cosine similarity, and vectors of size 50,000 (based on the results from Section 3.1).",
        "Figure 2 shows the results for all the similarity datasets, with the aggregated score at the bottom right.",
        "Performance was evaluated on three corpora, in order to answer three questions: Does window size affect performance?",
        "Does corpus size interact with window size?",
        "Does corpus sub-Figure 2: Impact of window size across three corpora spacing interact with window size?",
        "Figure 2 clearly shows the answer to all three questions is ?yes?.",
        "First, ukWaC consistently outperforms the BNC, across all window sizes, indicating that a larger source corpus leads to better performance.",
        "Second, we see that the larger ukWaC performs better with smaller window sizes compared to the BNC, with the best ukWaC performance typically being found with a window size of only 3.",
        "For the BNC, it appears that a larger window is able to offset the smaller size of corpus to some extent.",
        "We also evaluated on a sub-spaced Wikipedia source corpus similar to Stone et al. (2008), which performs much better with larger window sizes than the BNC or ukWaC.",
        "Our explanation for this result is that sub-spacing, resulting from searching for Wikipedia pages with the appropriate target terms, provides a focused, less noisy corpus in which context words some distance from the target word are still relevant to its meaning.",
        "In summary, the highest score is typically achieved with the largest source corpora and smallest window size, with the exception of the much smaller sub-spaced Wikipedia corpus.",
        "3.3 Context The notion of context plays a key role in VSMs.",
        "Padó and Lapata (2007) present a comparison of window-based versus dependency-based methods and conclude that dependency-based contexts give better results.",
        "We also compare window-based and dependency-based models.",
        "Dependency-parsed versions of the BNC and ukWaC were used to construct syntactically-informed vectors, with a single, labelled arc be-24 Figure 3: Window versus dependency contexts tween the target word and context word.",
        "3 Since this effectively provides a window size of 3, we also use a window size of 3 for the window-based method (which provided the best results in Section 3.2 with the ukWaC corpus).",
        "As well as the ukWaC and BNC source corpora, we use the Google syntactic N-gram corpus (Goldberg and Orwant, 2013), which is one of the largest corpora to date, and which consists of syntactic n-grams as opposed to window-based n-grams.",
        "We use vectors of size 50,000 with Positive Mutual Information weighting and Cosine similarity.",
        "Due to its size and associated computational cost, we used only 10,000 contexts for the vectors generated from the syntactic N-gram corpus.",
        "The results are shown in Figure 3.",
        "In contrast to the idea that dependency-based methods outperform window-based methods, we find that the window-based models outperform dependency-based models when they are constructed from the same corpus using the small window size.",
        "However, Google's syntactic N-gram corpus does indeed outperform window-based methods, even though smaller vectors were used for the Google models (10,000 vs. 50,000 features).",
        "We observe large variations across datasets, with window-based methods performing particularly well on some, but not all.",
        "In partic-ular, window-based methods clearly outperform dependency-based methods on the RG dataset (for the same source corpus), whereas the opposite trend is observed for the TOEFL synonym dataset.",
        "The summary is that the model built from the syntactic N-grams is the overall winner, but when we 3 The Clark and Curran (2007) parser was used to provide the dependencies.",
        "compare both methods on the same corpus, the window-based method on a large corpus appears to work best (given the small window size).",
        "3.4 Feature granularity Stemming and lemmatisation are standard techniques in NLP and IR to reduce data sparsity.",
        "However, with large enough corpora it may be that the loss of information through generalisation hurts performance.",
        "In fact, it may be that increased granularity ?",
        "through the use of grammatical tags ?",
        "can lead to improved performance.",
        "We test these hypotheses by comparing four types of processed context words: lemmatised, stemmed, POS-tagged, and tagged with CCG lexical categories (which can be thought of as fine-grained POS tags (Clark and Curran, 2007)).",
        "4 The source corpora are BNC and ukWaC, using a window-based method with windows of size 5, Positive Mutual Information weighting, vectors of size 50,000 and Cosine similarity.",
        "The results are reported in Figure 4.",
        "The ukWaC-generated vectors outperform the BNC-generated ones on all but a single instance for each of the granularities.",
        "Stemming yields the best overall performance, and increasing the granularity does not lead to better results.",
        "Even with a very large corpus like ukWaC, stemming yields signficantly better results than not reducing the feature granularity at all.",
        "Conversely, apart from the results on the TOEFL synonym dataset, increasing the feature granularity of contexts by including POS tags or CCG categories does not yield any improvement.",
        "3.5 Similarity-weighting combination There is contrasting evidence in the literature regarding which combination of similarity metric and weighting scheme works best.",
        "Here we investigate this question using vectors of size 50,000, no processing of the context features (i.e., ?nor- mal?",
        "feature granularity), and a window-based method with a window size of 5.",
        "Aggregated scores across the datasets are reported in Tables 4 and 5 for the BNC and ukWaC, respectively.",
        "There are some clear messages to be taken from these large tables of results.",
        "First, two weighting schemes perform better than the others: Positive Mutual Information (PosMI) and T-Test.",
        "On the BNC, the former yields the best results.",
        "There are 4 Using NLTK's Porter stemmer and WordNet lemmatiser.",
        "25 Figure 4: Feature granularity: stemmed (S), lemmatised (L), normal (N), POS-tagged (T) and CCG-tagged (C) RG MC W353 MEN TOEFL P+COS 0.74 0.64 0.50 0.66 0.76 P+COR 0.74 0.65 0.58 0.71 0.83 T+COS 0.78 0.69 0.54 0.68 0.78 T+COR 0.78 0.71 0.54 0.68 0.78 Table 6: Similarity scores on individual datasets for positive mutual information (P) and T-test (T) weighting, with cosine (COS) and correlation (COR) similarity three similarity metrics that perform particularly well: Cosine, Correlation and the Tanimoto coefficient (the latter also being similar to Cosine; see Table 2).",
        "The Correlation similarity metric has the most consistent performance across the different weighting schemes, and yields the highest score for both corpora.",
        "The most consistent weighting scheme across the two source corpora and similarity metrics appears to be PosMI.",
        "The highest combined aggregate score is that of PosMI with the Correlation metric, in line with the conclusion of Bullinaria and Levy (2012) that PosMI is the best weighting scheme 5 .",
        "However, for the large ukWaC corpus, T-Test achieves similarly high aggregate scores, in line with the work of Curran (2004).",
        "When we look at these two weighting schemes in more detail, we see that T-Test works best for the RG and MC datasets, while PosMI works best for the others; see Table 6.",
        "Correlation is the best similarity metric in all cases.",
        "5 In some cases, the combination of weighting scheme and similarity metric results in a division by zero or leads to taking the logarithm of a negative number, in which cases we report the aggregate scores as nan (not-a-number).",
        "Figure 5: Finding the optimal ?contiguous subvec-tor?",
        "of size 10,000 3.6 Optimal subvector Stopwords are typically removed from vectors and not used as features.",
        "However, Bullinaria and Levy (2012) find that removing stopwords has no effect on performance.",
        "A possible explanation is that, since they are using a weighting scheme, the weights of stopwords are low enough that they have effectively been removed anyhow.",
        "This raises the question: are we removing stopwords because they contribute little towards the meaning of the target word, or are we removing them because they have high frequency?",
        "The experiment used ukWaC, with a window-based method and window size of 5, normal feature granularity, Cosine similarity and a sliding vector of size 10,000.",
        "Having a sliding vector implies that we throw away up to the first 40,000 contexts as we slide across to the 50,000 mark (replac- ing the higher frequency contexts with lower frequency ones).",
        "In effect, we are trying to find the cut-off point where the 10,000-component ?con- tiguous subvector?",
        "of the target word vector is optimal (where the features are ordered by fre-quency).",
        "Results are given for PosMI, T-Test and no weighting at all.",
        "The results are shown in Figure 5.",
        "T-test outperforms PosMI at the higher frequency ranges (to the left of the plots) but PosMI gives better results for some of the datasets further to the right.",
