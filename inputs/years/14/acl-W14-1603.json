        "Linguists and psychologists have long been studying cross-linguistic transfer, the influence of native language properties on linguistic performance in a foreign language.",
        "In this work we provide empirical evidence for this process in the form of a strong correlation between language similarities derived from structural features in English as Second Language (ESL) texts and equivalent similarities obtained from the typological features of the native languages.",
        "We leverage this finding to recover native language typological similarity structure directly from ESL text, and perform prediction of typological features in an unsupervised fashion with respect to the target languages.",
        "Our method achieves 72.2% accuracy on the typology prediction task, a result that is highly competitive with equivalent methods that rely on typological resources."

        "Cross-linguistic transfer can be broadly described as the application of linguistic structure of a speaker's native language in the context of a new, foreign language.",
        "Transfer effects may be expressed on various levels of linguistic perfor-mance, including pronunciation, word order, lexical borrowing and others (Jarvis and Pavlenko, 2007).",
        "Such traces are prevalent in non-native English, and in some cases are even celebrated in anecdotal hybrid dialect names such as ?Frenglish?",
        "and ?Denglish?.",
        "Although cross-linguistic transfer was extensively studied in Psychology, Second Language Acquisition (SLA) and Linguistics, the conditions under which it occurs, its linguistic characteristics as well as its scope remain largely under debate (Jarvis and Pavlenko, 2007; Gass and Selinker, 1992; Odlin, 1989).",
        "In NLP, the topic of linguistic transfer was mainly addressed in relation to the Native Language Identification (NLI) task, which requires to predict the native language of an ESL text's author.",
        "The overall high performance on this classification task is considered to be a central piece of evidence for the existence of cross-linguistic transfer (Jarvis and Crossley, 2012).",
        "While the success on the NLI task confirms the ability to extract native language signal from second language text, it offers little insight into the linguistic mechanisms that play a role in this process.",
        "In this work, we examine the hypothesis that cross-linguistic structure transfer is governed by the typological properties of the native language.",
        "We provide empirical evidence for this hypothesis by showing that language similarities derived from structural patterns of ESL usage are strongly correlated with similarities obtained directly from the typological features of the native languages.",
        "This correlation has broad implications on the ability to perform inference from native language structure to second language performance and vice versa.",
        "In particular, it paves the way for a novel and powerful framework for comparing native languages through second language performance.",
        "This framework overcomes many of the inherent difficulties of direct comparison between lan-guages, and the lack of sufficient typological documentation for the vast majority of the world's languages.",
        "Further on, we utilize this transfer enabled framework for the task of reconstructing typological features.",
        "Automated prediction of language typology is extremely valuable for both linguistic studies and NLP applications which rely on such information (Naseem et al., 2012; T?ackstr?om et al., 2013).",
        "Furthermore, this task provides an objective external testbed for the quality of our native 21 language similarity estimates derived from ESL texts.",
        "Treating native language similarities obtained from ESL as an approximation for typological similarities, we use them to predict typological features without relying on typological annotation for the target languages.",
        "Our ESL based method yields 71.4% ?",
        "72.2% accuracy on the typology reconstruction task, as compared to 69.1% ?",
        "74.2% achieved by typology based methods which depend on pre-existing typological resources for the target languages.",
        "To summarize, this paper offers two main contributions.",
        "First, we provide an empirical result that validates the systematic existence of linguistic transfer, tying the typological characteristics of the native language with the structural patterns of foreign language usage.",
        "Secondly, we show that ESL based similarities can be directly used for prediction of native language typology.",
        "As opposed to previous approaches, our method achieves strong results without access to any a-priori knowledge about the target language typology.",
        "The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 surveys the literature and positions our study in relation to previous research on cross-linguistic transfer and language typology.",
        "Section 3 describes the ESL corpus and the database of typological features.",
        "In section 4, we delineate our method for deriving native language similarities and hierarchical similarity trees from structural features in ESL.",
        "In section 5 we use typological features to construct another set of language similarity estimates and trees, which serve as a benchmark for the typological validity of the ESL based similarities.",
        "Section 6 provides a correlation analysis between the ESL based and typology based similarities.",
        "Finally, in section 7 we report our results on typology reconstruction, a task that also provides an evaluation framework for the similarity structures derived in sections 4 and 5.",
        "2 Related Work Our work integrates two areas of research, cross-linguistic transfer and linguistic typology.",
        "2.1 Cross-linguistic Transfer The study of cross-linguistic transfer has thus far evolved in two complementary strands, the linguistic comparative approach, and the computational detection based approach.",
        "While the comparative approach focuses on case study based qualitative analysis of native language influence on second language performance, the detection based approach revolves mainly around the NLI task.",
        "Following the work of Koppel et al. (2005), NLI has been gaining increasing interest in NLP, culminating in a recent shared task with 29 participating systems (Tetreault et al., 2013).",
        "Much of the NLI efforts thus far have been focused on exploring various feature sets for optimizing classification performance.",
        "While many of these features are linguistically motivated, some of the discriminative power of these approaches stems from cultural and domain artifacts.",
        "For example, our preliminary experiments with a typical NLI feature set, show that the strongest features for predicting Chinese are strings such as China and in China.",
        "Similar features dominate the weights of other languages as well.",
        "Such content features boost classification performance, but are hardly relevant for modeling linguistic phenomena, thus weakening the argument that NLI classification performance is indicative of cross-linguistic transfer.",
        "Our work incorporates an NLI component, but departs from the performance optimization orientation towards leveraging computational analysis for better understanding of the relations between native language typology and ESL usage.",
        "In par-ticular, our choice of NLI features is driven by their relevance to linguistic typology rather than their contribution to classification performance.",
        "In this sense, our work aims to take a first step towards closing the gap between the detection and comparative approaches to cross-linguistic transfer.",
        "2.2 Language Typology The second area of research, language typology, deals with the documentation and comparative study of language structures (Song, 2011).",
        "Much of the descriptive work in the field is summarized in the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) 1 (Dryer and Haspelmath, 2013) in the form of structural features.",
        "We use the WALS features as our source of typological information.",
        "Several previous studies have used WALS features for hierarchical clustering of languages and typological feature prediction.",
        "Most notably, Teh et al. (2007) and subsequently Daum?e III (2009) 1 http://wals.info/ 22 predicted typological features from language trees constructed with a Bayesian hierarchical clustering model.",
        "In Georgi et al. (2010) additional clustering approaches were compared using the same features and evaluation method.",
        "In addition to the feature prediction task, these studies also evaluated their clustering results by comparing them to genetic language clusters.",
        "Our approach differs from this line of work in several aspects.",
        "First, similarly to our WALS based baselines, the clustering methods presented in these studies are affected by the sparsity of available typological data.",
        "Furthermore, these methods rely on existing typological documentation for the target languages.",
        "Both issues are obviated in our English based framework which does not depend on any typological information to construct the native language similarity struc-tures, and does not require any knowledge about the target languages except from the ESL essays of a sample of their speakers.",
        "Finally, we do not compare our clustering results to genetic groupings, as to our knowledge, there is no firm theoretical ground for expecting typologically based clustering to reproduce language phylogenies.",
        "The empirical results in Georgi et al. (2010), which show that typology based clustering differs substantially from genetic groupings, support this assumption.",
        "3 Datasets 3.1 Cambridge FCE We use the Cambridge First Certificate in English (FCE) dataset (Yannakoudakis et al., 2011) as our source of ESL data.",
        "This corpus is a subset of the Cambridge Learner Corpus (CLC) 2 .",
        "It contains English essays written by upper-intermediate level learners of English for the FCE examination.",
        "The essay authors represent 16 native languages.",
        "We discarded Dutch and Swedish speakers due to the small number of documents available for these languages (16 documents in total).",
        "The remaining documents are associated with the following 14 native languages: Catalan, Chinese, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai and Turkish.",
        "Overall, our corpus comprises 1228 doc-uments, corresponding to an average of 87.7 documents per native language.",
        "2 http://www.cambridge.org/gb/elt/ catalogue/subject/custom/item3646603 3.2 World Atlas of Language Structures We collect typological information for the FCE native languages from WALS.",
        "Currently, the database contains information about 2,679 of the world's 7,105 documented living languages (Lewis, 2014).",
        "The typological feature list has 188 features, 175 of which are present in our dataset.",
        "The features are associated with 9 linguistic cat-egories: Phonology, Morphology, Nominal Cate-gories, Nominal Syntax, Verbal Categories, Word Order, Simple Clauses, Complex Sentences and Lexicon.",
        "Table 1 presents several examples for WALS features and their range of values.",
        "One of the challenging characteristics of WALS is its low coverage, stemming from lack of available linguistic documentation.",
        "It was previously estimated that about 84% of the language-feature pairs in WALS are unknown (Daum?e III, 2009; Georgi et al., 2010).",
        "Even well studied languages, like the ones used in our work, are lacking values for many features.",
        "For example, only 32 of the WALS features have known values for all the 14 languages of the FCE corpus.",
        "Despite the prevalence of this issue, it is important to bear in mind that some features do not apply to all languages by definition.",
        "For instance, feature 81B Languages with two Dominant Orders of Subject, Object, and Verb is relevant only to 189 languages (and has documented values for 67 of them).",
        "We perform basic preprocessing, discarding 5 features that have values for only one language.",
        "Further on, we omit 19 features belonging to the category Phonology as comparable phonological features are challenging to extract from the ESL textual data.",
        "After this filtering, we remain with 151 features, 114.1 features with a known value per language, 10.6 languages with a known value per feature and 2.5 distinct values per feature.",
        "Following previous work, we binarize all the WALS features, expressing each feature in terms of k binary features, where k is the number of values the original feature can take.",
        "Note that beyond the well known issues with feature bi-narization, this strategy is not optimal for some of the features.",
        "For example, the feature 111A Non-periphrastic Causative Constructions whose possible values are presented in table 1 would have been better encoded with two binary features rather than four.",
        "The question of optimal encoding for the WALS feature set requires expert analysis and will be addressed in future research.",
        "23 ID Type Feature Name Values 26A Morphology Prefixing vs. Suffixing in Little affixation, Strongly suffixing, Weakly Inflectional Morphology suffixing, Equal prefixing and suffixing, Weakly prefixing, Strong prefixing.",

        "To predict features using a hierarchical cluster tree, we set the value of each target language feature to its majority value among the members of the parent cluster of the target language, excluding the target language itself.",
        "For example, using the tree in figure 2(a), the feature values for the target language French will be obtained by taking majority votes between Portuguese, Italian and Spanish.",
        "Similarly to the matrix based prediction, missing values and ties are handled by backing-off to a larger set of languages, in this case by proceeding to subsequent levels of the cluster hierarchy.",
        "For the French example in figure 2(a), the first fall-back option will be the Romance cluster.",
        "Following the evaluation setups in Daum?e III (2009) and Georgi et al. (2010), we evaluate the WALS based similarity estimates and trees by constructing them using 90% of the WALS features.",
        "We report the average accuracy over 100 random folds of the data.",
        "In the shared-all regime, we provide predictions not only for the remaining 10% of features shared by all languages, but also for all the other features that have values in the target language and are not used for the tree construction.",
        "Importantly, as opposed to the WALS based prediction, our ESL based method does not require any typological features for inferring language similarities and constructing the similarity tree.",
        "In particular, no typological information is required for the target languages.",
        "Typological features are needed only for the neighbors of the target language, from which the features are projected.",

        "3.4% behind the shared-pairwise construction.",
        "Also note that for both WALS based and ESL based predictions, the highest results are achieved using the hierarchical tree predictions, confirming the suitability of this representation for accurately capturing language similarity structure.",
        "Figure 3 presents the performance of the strongest WALS based typological feature completion method, WALS shared-pairwise tree, as a function of the percentage of features used for obtaining the language similarity estimates.",
        "The figure also presents the strongest result of the ESL method, using the ESL tree, which does not require any such typological training data for obtaining the language similarities.",
        "As can be seen, the WALS based approach would require access to almost 40% of the currently documented WALS features to match the performance of the ESL method.",
        "The competitive performance of our ESL method on the typology prediction task underlines 27 Method NN 3NN Tree WALS shared-all 71.6 71.4 69.1 WALS shared-pairwise 73.1 74.1 74.2 ESL 71.4 70.7 72.2 Table 3: Typology reconstruction results.",
        "Three types of predictions are compared, nearest neigh-bor (NN), 3 nearest neighbors (3NN) and nearest tree neighbors (Tree).",
        "WALS shared-all are WALS based predictions, where only the 32 features that have known values in all 14 languages are used for computing language similarities.",
        "In the WALS shared-pairwise predictions the language similarities are computed using the WALS features shared by each language pair.",
        "ESL results are obtained by projection of WALS features from the closest languages according to the ESL language similarities.",
        "its ability to extract strong typologically driven signal, while being robust to the partial nature of existing typological annotation which hinders the performance of the baselines.",
        "Given the small amount of ESL data at hand, these results are highly encouraging with regard to the prospects of our approach to support typological inference, even in the absence of any typological documentation for the target languages.",
        "8 Conclusion and Outlook We present a novel framework for utilizing cross-linguistic transfer to infer language similarities from morpho-syntactic features of ESL text.",
        "Trading laborious expert annotation of typological features for a modest amount of ESL texts, we are able to reproduce language similarities that strongly correlate with the equivalent typology based similarities, and perform competitively on a typology reconstruction task.",
        "Our study leaves multiple questions for future research.",
        "For example, while the current work examines structure transfer, additional investigation is required to better understand lexical and phonological transfer effects.",
        "Furthermore, we currently focuse on native language typology, and assume English as the foreign language.",
        "This limits our ability to study the constraints imposed on cross-linguistic transfer by the foreign language.",
        "An intriguing research direction would be to explore other foreign languages and compare the outcomes to our results on English.",
        "Figure 3: Comparison of the typological feature completion performance obtained using the WALS tree with shared-pairwise similarities and the ESL tree based typological feature completion performance.",
        "The dotted line represents the WALS based prediction accuracy, while the horizontal line is the ESL based accuracy.",
        "The horizontal axis corresponds to the percentage of WALS features used for constructing the WALS based language similarity estimates.",
        "Finally, we plan to formulate explicit models for the relations between specific typological features and ESL usage patterns, and extend our typology induction mechanisms to support NLP applications in the domain of multilingual processing.",
