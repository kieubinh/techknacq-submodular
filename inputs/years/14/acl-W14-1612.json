        "Abstract",
        "Most previous work in information extraction from text has focused on named-entity recognition, entity linking, and relation extraction.",
        "Less attention has been paid given to extracting the temporal scope for relations between named entities; for example, the relation president-Of(John F. Kennedy, USA) is true only in the time-frame (January 20, 1961 November 22, 1963).",
        "In this paper we present a system for temporal scoping of relational facts, which is trained on distant supervision based on the largest semi-structured resource available: Wikipedia.",
        "The system employs language models consisting of patterns automatically bootstrapped from Wikipedia sentences that contain the main entity of a page and slot-fillers extracted from the corresponding infoboxes.",
        "This proposed system achieves state-of-the-art results on 6 out of 7 relations on the benchmark Text Analysis Conference 2013 dataset for temporal slot filling (TSF), and outperforms the next best system in the TAC 2013 evaluation by more than 10 points."

        "Previous work on relation extraction (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Etzioni et al., 2004) by systems such as NELL (Carlson et al., 2010), Know-ItAll (Etzioni et al., 2004) and YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007) have targeted the extraction of entity tuples, such as president-Of(George W. Bush, USA), in order to build large knowledge bases of facts.",
        "These systems assume that relational facts are time-invariant.",
        "However, this assumption is not always true, for example ?",
        "This research was carried out during an internship at Microsoft Research.",
        "president-Of(George W. Bush, USA) holds within the time-frame (2001-2009) only.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the relatively less explored problem of attaching temporal scope to relation between entities.",
        "The Text Analysis Conference (TAC) introduced temporal slot filling (TSF) as one of the knowledge base population (KBP) tasks in 2013 (Dang and Surdeanu, 2013).",
        "The input to a TAC-TSF system is a binary relation e.g. per:spouse(Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston) and a document assumed to contain supporting evidence for the relation.",
        "The required output is a 4-tuple timestamp [T1, T2, T3, T4], where T1 and T2 are normalized dates that provide a range for the start date of the relation, and T3 and T4 provide the range for the end of the relationship.",
        "Systems must also output the offsets of the text mentions that support the temporal information extracted.",
        "For example, from a text such as ?Pitt married Jennifer Aniston on July 29, 2000 [...] the couple divorced five years later in 2005.?, a system must extract the normalized timestamp [2000- 07-29, 2000-07-29, 2005-01-01, 2005-12-31], together with the entity and date offsets that support the timestamp.",
        "In this paper, we describe TSRF, a system for temporal scoping of relational facts.",
        "For every relation type, TSRF uses distant supervision from Wikipedia infobox tuples to learn a language model consisting of patterns of entity types, cate-gories, and word n-grams.",
        "Then it uses this trained relation-specific language model to extract the top k sentences that support the given relation between the query entity and the slot filler.",
        "In a second stage, TSRF performs timestamp classification by employing models which learn ?Start?, ?End?",
        "and ?In?",
        "predictors of entities in a relationship; it computes the best 4-tuple timestamp [T1, T2, T3, T4] based on the confidence values associated to the top sentences extracted.",
        "Following the TAC-TSF task for 2013, TSRF is trained and evaluated for seven relation types, as shown in Table 1.",
        "109 per:spouse per:title per:employee or member of org:top employees/members per:cities of residence per:statesorprovinces of residence per:countries of residence Table 1: Types of relations in the TAC-TSF.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-lows: The next section describes related work.",
        "Section 3 introduces the TAC-TSF input and output formats.",
        "Section 4 discusses the main chal-lenges, and Section 5 details our method for temporal scoping of relations.",
        "Section 6 describes our experiments and results, and it is followed by concluding remarks.",
        "2 Related Work To our knowledge, there are only a small number of systems that have tackled the temporal scoping of relations task.",
        "YAGO (Wang et al., 2010) extracts temporal facts using regular expressions from Wikipedia infoboxes, while PRAVDA (Wang et al., 2011) uses a combination of textual patterns and graph-based re-ranking techniques to extract facts and their temporal scopes simultaneously.",
        "Both systems augment an existing KB with temporal facts similarly to the CoTS system by Talukdar et al. (2012a; 2012b).",
        "However, their underlying techniques are not applicable to arbitrary text.",
        "In contrast, TSRF automatically bootstraps patterns to learn relation-specific language models, which can be used then for processing any text.",
        "CoTS, a recent system that is part of CMU's NELL (Carlson et al., 2010) project, performs temporal scoping of relational facts by using manually edited temporal order constraints.",
        "While manual ordering is appealing and can lead to high accuracy, it is impractical from a scalability perspective.",
        "Moreover, the main goal of CoTS is to predict temporal ordering of relations rather than to scope temporally individual facts.",
        "Conversely, our system automatically extracts text patterns, and then uses them to perform temporal classification based on gradient boosted decision trees (Friedman, 2001).",
        "The TempEval task (Pustejovsky and Verhagen, 2009) focused mainly on temporal event ordering.",
        "Systems such as (Chambers et al., 2007) and (Bethard and Martin, 2007) have been successful Col.1: TEMP72211 Col.7: 1492 Col.2: per:spouse Col.8: 1311 Col.3: Brad Pitt Col.9: 1.0 Col.4: AFP ENG 20081208.0592 Col.10: E0566375 Col.5: Jennifer Aniston Col.11: E0082980 Col.6: 1098 Table 2: Input to a TSF System.",
        "in extracting temporally related events.",
        "Sil et al. (2011a) automatically extract STRIPS representations (Fikes and Nilsson, 1971) from web text, which are defined as states of the world before and after an event takes place.",
        "However, all these efforts focus on temporal ordering of either events or states of the world and do not extract timestamps for events.",
        "By contrast, the proposed system extracts temporal expressions and also produces an ordering of the timestamps of relational facts between entities.",
        "The current state-of-the-art systems for TSF have been the RPI-Blender system by Artiles et al. (2011) and the UNED system by Garrido et al. (2011; 2012).",
        "These systems obtained the top scores in the 2011 TAC TSF evaluation by outperforming the other participants such as the Stanford Distant Supervision system (Surdeanu et al., 2011).",
        "Similar to our work, these systems use distant supervision to assign temporal labels to relations extracted from text.",
        "While we employ Wikipedia infoboxes in conjunction with Wikipedia text, the RPI-Blender and UNED systems use tuples from structured repositories like Freebase.",
        "There are major differences in terms of learning strategies of these systems: the UNED system uses a rich graph-based document-level representation to generate novel features whereas RPI-Blender uses an ensemble of classifiers combining flat features based on surface text and dependency paths with tree kernels.",
        "Our system employs language models based on Wikipedia that are annotated automatically with entity tags in a boosted-trees learning framework.",
        "A less important difference between TSRF and RPI-Blender is that the latter makes use of an additional temporal label (Start-And-End) for facts within a time range; TSRF employs Start, End, and In labels.",
        "3 The Temporal Slot Filling Task 3.1 Input The input format for a TSF system as instantiated for the relation per:spouse(Brad Pitt, Jennifer 110 Aniston) is shown in Table 2.",
        "The field Column 1 contains a unique query ID for the relation.",
        "Column 2 is the name of the relationship, which also encodes the type of the target entity.",
        "Column 3 contains the name of the query entity, i.e., the subject of the relation.",
        "Column 4 contains a valid document ID and Column 5 indicates the slot-filler entity.",
        "Columns 6 through 8 are offsets of the slot-filler, query entity and the relationship justification in the given text.",
        "Column 9 contains a confidence score set to 1 to indicate that the relation is correct.",
        "Columns 10 and 11 contain the IDs in the KBP knowledge base of the entity and filler, respectively.",
        "All of the above are provided by TAC.",
        "For the query in this example, a TSF system has to scope temporally the per:spouse relation between Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston.",
        "3.2 Output Similar to the regular slot filling task in TAC, the TSF output includes the offsets for at least one entity mention and up to two temporal mentions used for the extraction and normalization of hypothesized answer.",
        "For instance, assume that a system extracts the relative timestamp ?Monday?",
        "and normalizes it to ?2010-10-04?",
        "for the relation org:top employee(Twitter, Williams) using the document date from the following document: <DOCID> AFP ENG 20101004.0053.LDC2010T13 </DOCID> <DATETIME> 2010-10-04 </DATETIME> <HEADLINE> Twitter co-founder steps down as CEO </HEADLINE> <TEXT> <P> Twitter co-founder Evan Williams announced on Monday that he was stepping down as chief executive [...] The system must report the offsets for both ?Monday?",
        "in the text body and ?2010-10-04?",
        "in the DATETIME block for the justification.",
        "The TAC-TSF task uses the following representation for the temporal information extracted: For each relation provided in the input, TSF systems must produce a 4-tuple of dates: [T1, T2, T3, T4], which indicates that the relation is true for a period beginning at some point in time between T1 and T2 and ending at some time between T3 and T4.",
        "By convention, a hyphen in one of the positions implies a lack of a constraint.",
        "Thus, [-, 20120101, 20120101, -] implies that the relation was true starting on or before January 1, 2012 and ending on or after January 1, 2012.",
        "As discussed in the TAC 2011 pilot study by Ji et al. (2011), there are situations that cannot be covered by this representation, such as recurring events, for example repeated marriages between two persons.",
        "However, the most common situations for the relations covered in this task are captured correctly by this 4-tuple representation.",
        "4 Challenges We discuss here some of the main challenges encountered in building a temporal scoping system.",
        "4.1 Lack of Annotated Data Annotation of data for this task is expensive, as the human annotators must have extensive background knowledge and need to analyze the evidence in text and reliable knowledge resources.",
        "As per (Ji et al., 2013), a large team of human annotators were able to generate only 1,172 training instances for 8 slots for KBP 2011.",
        "The authors of the study concluded that such amount of data is not enough for training a supervised temporal scoping system.",
        "They also noted that only 32% of employee Of queries were found to have potential temporal arguments, and only one third of the queries could have reliable start or end dates.",
        "4.2 Date Normalization Sometimes temporal knowledge is not stated explicitly in terms of dates or timestamps.",
        "For exam-ple, from the text ?they got married on Valentine's Day?",
        "a system can extract Valentine's Day as the surface form of the start of the per:spouse relation.",
        "However, for a temporal scoping system it needs to normalize the temporal string to the date of February 14 and the year to which the document refers to explicitly in text or implicitly, such as the year in which the document was published.",
        "4.3 Lexico-Syntactic Variety A relation can be specified in text by employing numerous syntactic and lexical constructions; e.g. for the per:spouse relation the patterns ?got married on [DATE]?",
        "and ?vowed to spend eternity on [DATE]?",
        "have the same meaning.",
        "Addition-ally, entities can appear mentioned in text in various forms, different from the canonical form given as input.",
        "For instance, Figure 1 shows an example in which the input entity Bernardo Hees, which is not in Wikipedia, is mentioned three times, with two of the mentions using a shorter form (the last name of the person).",
        "111 org:top_members_employees America Latina Logistica / NIL Bernardo Hees / NIL <HEADLINE> Burger King buyer names future CEO </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> NEW YORK 2010-09-09 13:00:29 UTC </DATELINE> <TEXT> <P> The investment firm buying Burger King has named Bernardo Hees, a Latin American railroad executive, to be CEO of the company after it completes its $3.26 billion buyout of the fast-food chain.",
        "</P> <P> 3G Capital is naming Hees to replace John Chidsey, who will become co-chairman after the deal closes.",
        "</P> <P> Hees was most recently CEO of America Latina Logistica, Latin America's largest railroad company.",
        "Alexandre Behring, managing partner at 3G Capital, was also a prior CEO of the railroad.",
        "</P> <P> 3G Capital is expected to begin its effort to acquire the outstanding shares of Burger King for $24 per share by Sept. 17.",
        "</P> </TEXT> Figure 1: Example data point from the TAC TSF 2013 training set, with the annotations hypothesized by our system.",
        "The entity mentions identified by the entity linking (EL) component are shown in bold blue; those that were linked to Wikipedia are also underlined.",
        "The highlighting (blue and green) is used to show the mentions in the coreference chains identified for the two input entities, ?America Latina Logistica?",
        "and ?Bernardo Hees?.",
        "4.4 Inferred Meaning A temporal scoping system also needs to learn the inter-dependence of relations, and how one event affects another.",
        "For instance, in our automatically generated training data, we learn that a death event specified by n-grams like ?was assassinated?",
        "affects the per:title relation, and it indicates that the relationship ended at that point.",
        "In Figure 1, while the CEO relationships for Bernardo Hees with America Latina Logistica and Burger King are indicated by clear patterns (?was most recently CEO of?",
        "and ?to be CEO of?",
        "), the temporal stamping is difficult to achieve in both cases, as there is no standard normalization for ?recently?",
        "in the former, and it is relative to the completion of the buyout event in the latter.",
        "4.5 Pattern Trustworthiness A temporal scoping system should also be able to model the trustworthiness of text patterns, and even the evolution of patterns that indicate a relationship over time.",
        "For example, in current news, the birth of a child does not imply that a couple is married, although it does carry a strong signal about the marriage relationship.",
        "5 Learning to Attach Temporal Scope 5.1 Automatically Generating Training Data As outlined in Section 4, one of the biggest challenges of a temporal scoping system is the lack of annotated data to create a strong information extraction system.",
        "Previous work on relation extraction such as (Mintz et al., 2009) has shown that distant supervision can be highly effective in building a classifier for this purpose.",
        "Similar to supervised classification techniques, some advantages of using distant supervision are: ?",
        "It allows building classifiers with a large number of features; ?",
        "The supervision is provided intrinsically by the detailed user-contributed knowledge; ?",
        "There is no need to expand patterns iteratively.",
        "Mintz et al. also point out that similar to unsupervised systems, distant supervision also allows: ?",
        "Using large amounts of unlabeled data such as the Web and social media; ?",
        "Employing techniques that are not sensitive to the genre of training data.",
        "We follow the same premise as (Cucerzan, 2007; Weld et al., 2009) that the richness of the Wikipedia collection, whether semantic, lexical, syntactic, or structural, is a key enabler in redefining the state-of-the-art for many NLP and IR task.",
        "Our target is to use distant supervision from Wikipedia data to build an automatic temporal scoping system.",
        "However, for most relations, we find that Wikipedia does not indicate specific start or end dates in a structured form.",
        "In addition to this, we need our system to be able to predict whether two entities are currently in a relationship or not based on the document date as well.",
        "112 Hence, in our first step, we build an automatic system which takes as input a binary relation between two entities e.g. per:spouse(Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston) and a number of documents.",
        "The system needs to extract highly ranked/relevant sentences, which indicate that the two entities are in the targeted relationship.",
        "The next component takes as input the top k sentences generated in the previous step and extracts temporal labels for the input relation.",
        "Note that our target is to develop algorithms that are not relation-specific but rather can work well for a multitude of relations.",
        "We elaborate on these two system components further.",
        "5.1.1 Using Wikipedia as a Resource for Distant Supervision Wikipedia is the largest freely available encyclo-pedic collection, which is built and organized as a user-contributed knowledge base (KB) of entities.",
        "The current version of the English Wikipedia contains information about 4.2 million entities.",
        "In addition to the plain text about these entities, Wikipedia also contains structured components.",
        "One of these is the infobox.",
        "Infoboxes contain information about a large number of relations for the target entity of the Wikipedia page, e.g. names of spouses, birth and death dates, residence etc.. Similar to structured databases, the infoboxes contain the most important/useful relations in which entities take part, while the text of Wikipedia pages contains mentions and descriptions of these relations.",
        "Because of this, Wikipedia can be seen as a knowledge repository that contains parallel structured and unstructured information about entities, and therefore, can be employed more easily than Freebase or other structured databases for building a relation extraction system.",
        "Figure 2 shows how sentences from Wikipedia can be used to train a system for the temporal slot filling task.",
        "5.1.2 Extracting Relevant Sentences For every relation, we extract slot-filler names from infoboxes of each Wikipedia article.",
        "We also leverage Wikipedia's rich interlinking model to automatically retrieve labeled entity mentions in text.",
        "Because the format of the text values provided by different users for the infobox attributes can vary greatly, we rely on regular expressions to extract slot-filler names from the infoboxes.",
        "For every relation targeted, we build a large set of regular expressions to extract entity names and filter out noise e.g. html tags, redundant text etc.. To extract all occurrences of named-entities in the Wikipedia text, we relabel each Wikipedia article with Wikipedia interlinks by employing the entity linking (EL) system by Cucerzan (2012), which obtained the top scores for the EL task in successive TAC evaluations.",
        "This implementation takes into account and preserves the interlinks created by the Wikipedia contributors, and extracts all other entity mentions and links them to Wikipedia pages if possible or hypothesizes coreference chains for the mentions of entities that are not in Wikipedia.",
        "The latter are extremely important when the slot-filler for a relation is an entity that does not have a Wikipedia page, as often is the case with spouses or other family members of famous people (as shown in Figure 1 for the slot-filler Bernardo Hees).",
        "As stated in Section 4, temporal information in text is specified in various forms.",
        "To resolve temporal mentions, we use the Stanford SUTime (Chang and Manning, 2012) temporal tagger.",
        "The system exhibits strong performance outperforming state-of-the-art systems like HeidelTime (Str?otgen and Gertz, 2010) on the TempEval-2 Task A (Verhagen et al., 2010) in English.",
        "SUTime is a rule-based temporal tagger that employs regular expression.",
        "Its input is English text in tokenized format; its output contains annotations in the form of TIMEX3 tags.",
        "TIMEX3 is a part of the TimeML annotation language as introduced by (Pustejovsky et al., 2003) and is used to markup date and time, events, and their temporal relations in text.",
        "When processing Web text, we often encounter date expressions that contain a relative time e.g. ?last Thursday?.",
        "To resolve them to actual dates/time is a non-trivial task.",
        "However, the heuristic of employing the document's publication date as the reference works very well in practice e.g. for a document published on 2011- 07-05, SUTime resolves ?last Thursday?",
        "to 201106-30.",
        "It provides temporal tags in the following labels: Time, Duration, Set and Interval.",
        "For our experiments we used Time and Duration.",
        "After running the Stanford SUTime, which automatically converts date expressions to their normalized form, we collect sets of contiguous sentences from the page that contain one mention of the targeted entity and one mention of the slot-filler, as extracted by the entity linking system.",
        "We then build a large language model by bootstrapping textual patterns supporting the relations, sim-113 ilar to (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000).",
        "The general intuition is that a set of sentences that mention the two entities are likely to state something about relationships in which they are.",
        "For assigning sentences a relevance score with respect to a targeted relation, we represent the sentences in an input document (i.e., Wikipedia page) as d dimensional feature vectors, which incorporate statistics about how relevant sentences are to the relation between a query entity q and the slot filler z.",
        "For example, for the per:spouse relation, one binary feature is ?does the input sentence contain the n-gram ?QUERY ENTITY got married??.",
        "Note that the various surface forms/mentions of q and z are resolved to their canonical target at this stage.",
        "We were able to extract 61,872 tuples of query entity and slot filler relations from Wikipedia for the per:spouse relation.",
        "Figure 2 shows how we extract relevant sentences using slot-filler names from Wikipedia.",
        "Consider the following text (already processed by our EL system and Stanford SUTime) taken from the Wikipedia page of Tom Cruise: On [November 18, 2006| 2006?11?18 ], [Holmes| Katie Holmes ] and [Cruise| Tom Cruise ] were married in [Bracciano| Bracciano ] .",

        "Considering Tom Cruise as the query entity and his wife Katie Holmes as the slot filler for the per:spouse relation, we normalize the above text to the following form to extract features: On DATE, SLOT FILLER and QUERY ENTITY were married in LOCATION .",

        "On DATE, SLOT FILLER filed for divorce from QUERY ENTITY after five and a half years of marriage.",

        "Previous work such as Sil et al. (2011a; 2011b) used SVMs for ranking event preconditions and (Cucerzan, 2012) and (Zhou et al., 2010) employed GBDT for ranking entities.",
        "GBDT can achieve high accuracy as they can easily combine features of different scale and missing values.",
