        "Cross-lingual learning has become a popular approach to facilitate the development of resources and tools for low-density languages.",
        "Its underlying idea is to make use of existing tools and annotations in resource-rich languages to create similar tools and resources for resource-poor languages.",
        "Typically, this is achieved by either projecting annotations across parallel cor-pora, or by transferring models from one or more source languages to a target language.",
        "In this paper, we explore a third strategy by using machine translation to create synthetic training data from the original source-side annotations.",
        "Specifically, we apply this technique to dependency parsing, using a cross-lingually unified treebank for adequate evaluation.",
        "Our approach draws on annotation projection but avoids the use of noisy source-side annotation of an unrelated parallel corpus and instead relies on manual treebank annotation in combination with statistical machine translation, which makes it possible to train fully lexicalized parsers.",
        "We show that this approach significantly outperforms delexicalized transfer parsing."

        "The lack of resources and tools is a serious problem for the majority of the world's languages (Bender, 2013).",
        "Many applications require robust tools and the development of language-specific resources is expensive and time consuming.",
        "Furthermore, many tasks such as data-driven syntactic parsing require strong supervision to achieve reasonable results for real-world applications, since the performance of fully unsupervised methods lags behind by a large margin in comparison with the state of the art.",
        "Cross-lingual learning has been proposed as one possible solution to quickly create initial tools for languages that lack the appropriate resources (Ganchev and Das, 2013).",
        "By and large, there are two main strategies that have been proposed in the literature: annotation projection and model transfer.",
        "1.1 Previous Cross-Lingual Approaches Annotation projection relies on the mapping of linguistic annotation across languages using parallel corpora and automatic alignment as basic resources (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Hwa et al., 2005; T?ackstr?om et al., 2013a).",
        "Tools that exist for the source language are used to annotate the source side of the corpus and projection heuristics are then applied to map the annotation through word alignment onto the corresponding target language text.",
        "Target language tools can then be trained on the projected annotation assuming that the mapping is sufficiently correct.",
        "Less frequent, but also possi-ble, is the scenario where the source side of the corpus contains manual annotation (Agi?c et al., 2012).",
        "This addresses the problem created by projecting noisy annotations, but it presupposes parallel corpora with manual annotation, which are rarely avail-able, and expensive and time-consuming to produce.",
        "Model transfer instead relies on universal features and model parameters that can be transferred from one language to another.",
        "Abstracting away from all language-specific parameters makes it possible to train, e.g., delexicalized parsers that ignore lexical information.",
        "This approach has been used with success for a variety of languages, drawing from a harmonized POS tagset (Petrov et al., 2012) that is used as the main source of information.",
        "One advantage compared to annotation projection is that no parallel data is required.",
        "In addition, training can be performed on gold standard annotation.",
        "However, model transfer assumes a common fea-130 ture representation across languages (McDonald et al., 2013), which can be a strong bottleneck.",
        "Several extensions have been proposed to make the approach more robust.",
        "First of all, multiple source languages can be involved to increase the statistical basis for learning (McDonald et al., 2011; Naseem et al., 2012), a strategy that can also be used in the case of annotation projection.",
        "Cross-lingual word clusters can be created to obtain additional universal features (T?ackstr?om et al., 2012).",
        "Techniques for target language adaptation can be used to improve model transfer with multiple sources (T?ackstr?om et al., 2013b).",
        "1.2 The Translation Approach In this paper, we propose a third strategy, based on automatically translating training data to a new language in order to create annotated resources directly from the original source.",
        "Recent advances in statistical machine translation (SMT) combined with the ever-growing availability of parallel corpora are now making this a realistic alternative.",
        "The relation to annotation projection is obvious as both involve parallel data with one side being annotated.",
        "However, the use of direct translation brings two important advantages.",
        "First of all, using SMT, we do not accumulate errors from two sources: the tool ?",
        "e.g., tagger or parser ?",
        "used to annotate the source language of a bilingual corpus and the noise coming from alignment and projection.",
        "Instead, we use the gold standard annotation of the source language which can safely be assumed to be of much higher quality than any automatic annotation obtained by using a tool trained on that data.",
        "Moreover, using SMT may help in bypassing domain shift problems, which are common when applying tools trained (and evaluated) on one resource to text from another domain.",
        "Secondly, we can assume that SMT will produce output that is much closer to the input than manual translations in parallel texts usually are.",
        "Even if this may seem like a short-coming in general, in the case of annotation projection it should rather be an advantage, because it makes it more straightforward and less error-prone to transfer annotation from source to target.",
        "Furthermore, the alignment between words and phrases is inherently provided as an output of all common SMT models.",
        "Hence, no additional procedures have to be performed on top of the translated corpus.",
        "Recent research (Zhao et al., 2009; Durrett et al., 2012) has attempted to address synthetic data creation for syntactic parsing via bilingual lexica.",
        "We seek to build on this work by utilizing more advanced translation techniques.",
        "Further in the paper, we first describe the tools and resources used in our experiments (?2).",
        "We elaborate on our approach to translating treebanks (?3) and projecting syntactic annotations (?4) for a new language.",
        "Finally, we provide empirical evaluation of the suggested approach (?5) and observe a substantial increase in parsing accuracy over the delexicalized parsing baselines.",
        "2 Resources and Tools In our experiments, we rely on standard resources and tools for both dependency parsing and machine translation without any special enhancements.",
        "Since we are primarily trying to provide a proof of concept for the use of SMT-derived synthetic training data in dependency parsing, we believe it is more important to facilitate reproducibility than to tweak system components to obtain maximum accuracy.",
        "We use the Universal Dependency Treebank v1 (McDonald et al., 2013) for annotation projection, parser training and evaluation.",
        "It is a collection of data sets with consistent syntactic annotation for six languages: English, French, German, Ko-rean, Spanish, and Swedish.",
        "1 The annotation is based on Stanford Typed Dependencies for English (De Marneffe et al., 2006) but has been adapted and harmonized to allow adequate annotation of typologically different languages.",
        "This is the first collection of data sets that allows reliable evaluation of labeled dependency parsing accuracy across multiple languages (McDonald et al., 2013).",
        "We use the dedicated training and test sets from the treebank distribution in all our experiments.",
        "As argued in (McDonald et al., 2013), most cross-lingual dependency parsing experiments up to theirs relied on heterogeneous treebanks such as the CoNLL datasets for syntactic dependency parsing (Buch- holz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007a), making it difficult to address challenges like consistent cross-lingual analysis for downstream applications and reliable cross-lingual evaluation of syntactic parsers.",
        "More specifically, none of the previous research could report full labeled parsing accura-cies, but rather just unlabeled structural accuracies across different attachment schemes.",
        "Following the line of McDonald et al. (2013) regarding the 1 https://code.google.com/p/uni-dep-tb/ 131 emphasized importance of homogenous data and the assignment of labels, we only report labeled attachment scores (LAS) in all our experiments.",
        "As it is likely the first reliable cross-lingual parsing evaluation, we also choose their results as the baseline reference point for comparison with our experiments.",
        "For dependency parsing, we use MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2006a) 2 due to its efficiency in both training and parsing, and we facilitate MaltOptimizer (Ballesteros and Nivre, 2012) 3 to bypass the tedious task of manual feature selection.",
        "MaltParser is a transition-based dependency parser that has been evaluated on a number of different languages with competitive results (Nivre et al., 2006b; Nivre et al., 2007b; Hall et al., 2007) and it is widely used for benchmarking and application development.",
        "Although more accurate dependency parsers exist for the task of monolingual supervised parsing, it is not clear that these differences carry over to the cross-lingual scenario, where baselines are lower and more complex models are more likely to overfit.",
        "The use of a transition-based parser also facilitates comparison with delexicalized transfer parsing, where transition-based parsers are dominant so far (McDonald et al., 2011; McDonald et al., 2013).",
        "We leave the exploration of additional parsing approaches for future research.",
        "For machine translation, we select the popular Moses toolbox (Koehn et al., 2007) and the phrase-based translation paradigm as our basic framework.",
        "Phrase-based SMT has the advantage of being straightforward and efficient in training and decoding, while maintaining robustness and reliability for many language pairs.",
        "More details about the setup and the translation procedures are given in Section 3 below.",
        "The most essential ingredient for translation performance is the parallel corpus used for training the translation models.",
        "For our experiments we use the freely available and widely used Europarl corpus v7 (Koehn, 2005).",
        "4 It is commonly used for training SMT models and includes parallel data for all languages represented in the Universal Treebank except Korean, which we will, therefore, leave out in our experiments.",
        "For tuning we apply the newstest 2012 data provided by the annual workshop on statistical machine translation.",
        "5 For language modeling, we use a combination of 2 http://www.maltparser.org/ 3 http://nil.fdi.ucm.es/maltoptimizer/ 4 http://www.statmt.org/europarl/ 5 http://www.statmt.org/wmt14 DE EN ES FR SV DE 94 M 94 M 96 M 81 M EN 2.0 M 103 M 105 M 89 M ES 1.9 M 2.0 M 104 M 89 M FR 1.9 M 2.0 M 2.0 M 91 M SV 1.8 M 1.9 M 1.8 M 1.9 M mono 22.9 M 17.1 M 6.3 M 6.3 M 2.3 M Table 1: Parallel data and monolingual data used for training the SMT models.",

        "3 Translating Treebanks The main contribution of this paper is the empirical study of automatic treebank translation for parser transfer.",
        "We compare three different translation approaches in order to investigate the influence of several parameters.",
        "All of them are based on automatic word alignment and subsequent extraction of translation equivalents as common in phrase-based SMT.",
        "In particular, word alignment is performed using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) and IBM model 4 as the final model for creating the Viterbi word alignments for all parallel corpora used in our experiments.",
        "For the extraction of translation tables, we use the Moses toolkit with its standard settings to extract phrase tables with a maximum of seven tokens per phrase from a symmetrized word alignment.",
        "Symmetrization is done using the grow-diag-final-and heuristics (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "We tune phrase-based SMT models using minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) and the development data for each language pair.",
        "The language model is a standard 5-gram model estimated from the monolingual data using modified Kneser-Ney smoothing without pruning (applying KenLM tools (Heafield et al., 2013)).",
        "Our first translation approach is based on a very simple word-by-word translation model.",
        "For this, we select the most reliable translations of single words from the phrase translation tables extracted from the parallel corpora as described above.",
        "We restrict the model to tokens with alphabetic characters only using pre-defined Unicode character 132 sets.",
        "The selection of translation alternatives is based on the Dice coefficient, which combines the two essential conditional translation probabilities given in the phrase table.",
        "The Dice coefficient is in fact the harmonic mean of these two probabilities and has successfully been used for the extraction of translation equivalents before (Smadja et al., 1996): Dice(s, t) = 2 p(s, t) p(s) + p(t) = 2 ( 1 p(s|t) + 1 p(t|s) ) ?1 Other association measures would be possible as well but Smadja et al. (1996) argue that the Dice coefficient is more robust with respect to low frequency events than other common metrics such as pointwise mutual information, which can be a serious issue with the unsmoothed probability estimations in standard phrase tables.",
        "Our first translation model then applies the final one-to-one correspondences to monotonically translate treebanks word by word.",
        "We refer to it as the LOOKUP approach.",
        "Note that any bilingual dictionary could have been used to perform the same procedure.",
        "The second translation approach (WORD-BASED MT) is slightly more elaborate but still restricts the translation model to one-to-one word mappings.",
        "For this, we extract all single word translation pairs from the phrase tables and apply the standard beam-search decoder implemented in Moses to translate the original treebanks to all target languages.",
        "The motivation for this model is to investigate the impact of reordering and language models while still keeping the projection of annotated data as simple as possible.",
        "Note that the language model may influence not only the word order but also the lexical choice as we now allow multiple translation options in our phrase table.",
        "The final model implements translation based on the entire phrase table using the standard approach to PHRASE-BASED SMT.",
        "We basically run the Moses decoder with default settings and the parameters and models trained on our parallel corpora.",
        "Note that it is important for the annotation transfer to keep track of the alignment between phrases and words of the input and output sentences.",
        "The Moses decoder provides both, phrase segmentation and word alignment (if the latter is coded into the phrase tables).",
        "This will be important as we will see in the annotation projection discussed below.",

        "Given the properties of a dependency tree, where every word has exactly one syntactic head and dependency label, the annotation transfer is trivial for the two initial translation models.",
        "All annotation can simply be copied using the dictionary LOOKUP in which we enforce a monotonic one-to-one word mapping between source and target language.",
        "In the second approach, we only have to keep track of reordering, which is reported by the decoder when translating with our model.",
        "Note that the mapping is strictly one-to-one (bijective) as phrase-based SMT does not allow deletions or insertions at any point.",
        "This also ensures that we will always maintain a tree structure even though reordering may have a strong impact on projectivity (see Table 2).",
        "An illustration of this type of annotation transfer is shown in the left image of Figure 1.",
        "The third model, full PHRASE-BASED SMT, requires the most attention when transferring annotation across languages.",

        "In our approach, we try to make use of the additional information provided by the SMT decoder to avoid dummy-nodes and relations that may negatively influence the induced target language parser.",
        "Compared to the annotation projection approach of Hwa et al. (2005), the situation in our PHRASE-BASED SMT setting is slightly different.",
        "Here, we have two types of alignments that can be considered when relating source and target language items: (i) the alignment between phrases (pairs of consecutive n-grams) and (ii) the phrase-internal word alignment on which phrase extraction is based.",
        "The primary information used for annotation transfer is still the latter which has the same properties as described by Hwa et al. (2005) (except that we have truly many-to-many alignments in our data which were not available in their experiments).",
        "Note that words may be unaligned in phrase-based SMT as the phrase extraction algorithm used in Moses includes unaligned adjacent tokens.",
        "How-ever, for these unaligned words, we know to which phrase they belong and can also identify the corresponding phrase in the other language using phrase alignment information.",
        "This makes it possible to avoid the creation of dummy-nodes altogether and instead to link unaligned words to existing nodes based on the given phrase segmentation.",
        "Similarly, we define heuristics for handling one-to-many, many-to-one and many-to-many alignments that avoid the creation of dummy-nodes.",
        "The main procedure is illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "The key feature of this projection algorithm is that ambiguous alignments are handled by attaching words to the nodes that are highest up in the dependency tree (the procedure find highest() returns the node with minimum distance to the root of the tree).",
        "This ensures that we avoid cycles and isolated cliques in the graph.",
        "Furthermore, unaligned words are attached to the head of the target phrase they belong to, which seems to be the most appropriate place without further knowledge.",
