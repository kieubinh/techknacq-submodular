        "Phrase-based methods to machine translation (Koehn et al., 2003; Koehn et al., 2007) have drastically improved beyond word-based approaches, primarily by using phrase-pairs as translation units, which can memorize local lexical context and reordering patterns.",
        "However, this literal memorization mechanism makes it generalize poorly to unseen data.",
        "Moreover, phrase-based models make an independent assumption, stating that the application of phrases in a derivation is independent to each other which conflicts with the underlying truth that the translation decisions of phrases should be dependent on context.",
        "There are some work aiming to solve the two problems.",
        "Feng and Cohn (2013) propose a word-based Markov model to integrate translation and reordering into one model and use the sophisticated hierarchical Pitman-Yor process which backs off from larger to smaller context to provide dynamic adaptive smoothing.",
        "This model shows good generalization to unseen data while it uses words as the translation unit which cannot handle multiple-to-multiple links in real word alignments.",
        "Durrani et al. (2011) and Durrani et al. (2013) propose an operation sequence model (OSM) which models correlations between minimal translation units (MTUs) and evaluates probabilities with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing.",
        "On one hand the use of MTUs can help retain the multiple-to-multiple alignments, on the other hand its definition of operations where source words and target words are bundled into one operation makes it subjected to sparsity.",
        "The common feature of the above two methods is they both back off in one fixed path by dropping least recent events first which precludes some useful structures.",
        "For the segment pairs <b?a t?a k?aol`v j`?nq`u, take it into account> in Figure 1, the more common structure is <b?a ... k?aol`v j`?nq`u, take ... into account>.",
        "If we always drop the least recent events first, then we can only learn the pattern <... t?a k?aol`v j`?nq`u, ... it into account>.",
        "On these grounds, we propose a method with new definition of correlations and more robust probability modeling.",
        "This method defines a Markov model over correlations between minimal phrases where each is decomposed into three factors (source, target and jump).",
        "In the meantime it employs a fancier smoothing strategy for the Markov model which backs off by dropping multiple conditioning factors in parallel in order to learn richer structures.",
        "Both the uses of factors and parallel backoff give rise to robust modeling against sparsity.",
        "In addition, modeling bilingual information and reorderings into one model instead of adding them to the linear model as separate features allows for using more sophisticated estimation methods rather than get a loose weight for each feature from tuning algorithms.",
        "We compare the performance of our model with that of the phrase-based model and the hierarchical phrase-based model on the Chinese-English and Arabic-English NIST test sets, and get an im-151 Figure 1: Example Chinese-English sentence pair with word alignments shown as filled grid squares.",

        "For each deriva-tion, we can easily get its minimal phrase (MPs) sequence where MPs are ordered according to the order of their target side.",
        "Then this sequence of events is modeled as a Markov model and the log probability under this Markov model is included as an additional feature into the linear SMT model (Och, 2003).",
        "A MP denotes a phrase which cannot contain other phrases.",
        "For example, in the sentence pair in Figure 1, <b?a t?a , take it> is a phrase but not a minimal phrase, as it contains smaller phrases of <b?a , take> and <t?a , it>.",
        "MPs are a complex event representation for sequence modelling, and using these naively would be a poor choice because few bigrams and trigrams will be seen often enough for reliable estimation.",
        "In order to reason more effectively from sparse data, we consider more generalized representations by decomposing MPs into their component events: the source phrase (source ?",
        "f ), the target phrase (tar- get e?)",
        "and the jump distance from the preceding MP (jump j), where the jump distance is counted in MPs, not in words.",
        "For sparsity reasons, we do not use the jump distance directly but instead group it into 12 buckets: {insert,?",
        "?5,?4,?3,?2,?1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,?",
        "5}, where the jump factor is denoted as insert when the source side is NULL.",

        "The large gain for 2-grams is likely due to the model behaving like a LM, however the fact that consistent gains are still realized for higher k suggests that the approach brings considerable complementary information, i.e., it is doing much more than simply language modelling.",
        "5.5 Comparison with Lexical Reordering Our Markov model learns a joint model of jump, source and target factors and this is similar to the lexical reordering model of Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), which learns general orientations of pairs of adjacent phrases (classed as monotone, swap or other).",
        "Our method is more complex, by learning explicit jump distances, while also using broader context.",
        "Here we compare the two methods, and test whether our approach is complementary by realizing gains over the lexicalized reordering baseline.",

        "The results are shown in Table 5.",

        "BLEU.",
        "Our approach does much more than model reordering, so it is unlikely that this improvement is solely due to being better a model of distortion.",
        "This is underscored by the final result in Table 5, for combining lexicalized distortion with our model (Moses-l+M) which gives the highest BLEU score, yielding another 1.2% increase.",
        "5.6 Comparison with Word-based Markov Our approach uses minimal phrases as its basic unit of translation, in order to preserve the many-to-many links found from the word alignments.",
        "However we now seek to assess the impact of the choice of these basic units, considering instead a simpler word-based setting which retains only 1- to-1 links in a Markov model.",
        "To do this, we processed target words left-to-right and for target words with multiple links, we only retained the link which had the highest lexical translation probability.",
        "Then we trained a 3-gram word-based Markov model which backs off by dropping the factors of the least recent word pairs in the order of first jump then source then target.",
        "This model was included as a feature in the Moses-l baseline (de- noted as Moses-l+word), which we compared to a system using a MP-based Markov model backing off in the same way (denoted as Moses-l+MP).",
        "According to the results in Table 6, using MPs leads to better performance.",
        "Surprisingly even the word based method outperforms the baseline.",
        "This points to inadequate phrase-pair features in the baseline, which can be more robustly estimated using a Markov decomposition.",
        "In addition to allowing for advanced smoothing, the Markov model can be considered to tile phrases over one another (each k-gram overlaps k?1 others) rather than enforcing a single segmentation as is done in the PB and HPB approaches.",
        "Fox (2002) states that phrases tend to move as a whole during re-ordering, i.e., breaking MPs into words opens the possibility of making more reordering errors.",
        "We could easily use larger phrase pairs as the basic unit, such as the phrases used during decoding.",
        "However, doing this involves a hard segmentation 158 and would exacerbate issues of data sparsity.",
        "6 Conclusions In this paper we try to give a solution to the problems in phrase-based models, including weak generalization to unseen data and negligence of correlations between phrases.",
        "Our solution is to define a Markov model over minimal phrases so as to model translation conditioned on context and meanwhile use a fancy smoothing technique to learn richer structures such that can be applied to unseen data.",
        "Our method further decomposes each minimal phrase into three factors and operates in the unit of factors in the backoff process to provide a more robust modeling.",
        "In our experiments, we prove that our definition of factored Markov model provides complementary information to lexicalized reordering and high order language models and the use of parallel backoff infers richer structures even those out of the reach of 2-SCFG and hence brings big performance improvements.",
        "Overall our approach gives significant improvements over strong base-lines, giving consistent improvements of between 1.1 and 3.2 BLEU points on large scale Chinese-English and Arabic-English evaluations.",
