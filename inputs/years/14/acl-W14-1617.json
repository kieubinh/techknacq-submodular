        "The composition process yields a very large number of new phrase pair translations, which are high recall but low precision.",
        "We filter the phrase table using a new set of feature functions estimated from monolingual corpora.",
        "We evaluate the hallucinated phrase pairs intrinsically as well as in end-to-end machine translation.",
        "The augmented phrase table provides more coverage than the original phrase table, while being high quality enough to improve translation performance.",
        "We propose a four-part approach to hallucinating and using new phrase pair translations: 1.",
        "Learn potential translations for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words from comparable monolingual corpora 2.",

        "Augment the baseline phrase table with hallucinated translations and new feature functions estimated from monolingual corpora We define an algorithm for generating loosely compositional phrase pairs, which we use to hallucinate new translations.",
        "In oracle experiments, we show that such loosely compositional phrase pairs contribute substantially to the performance of end-to-end SMT, beyond that of component unigram translations.",
        "In our non-oracle experiments, we show that adding a judiciously pruned set of automatically hallucinated phrase pairs to an end-to-end baseline SMT model results in a significant improvement in translation quality for both Spanish-English and Hindi-English.",
        "2 Motivation Translation models learned over small amounts of parallel data suffer from the problem of low coverage.",
        "That is, they do not include translations for many words and phrases.",
        "Unknown 160 words, or out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, have been the focus of previous work on integrating bilingual lexicon induction and machine translation (Daum?e and Jagarlamudi, 2011; Irvine and Callison-Burch, 2013a; Razmara et al., 2013).",
        "Bilingual lexicon induction is the task of learning translations from monolingual texts, and typical approaches compare projected distributional signatures of words in the source language with distributional signatures representing target language words (Rapp, 1995; Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Haghighi et al., 2008).",
        "If the source and target language each contain, for example, 100, 000 words, the number of pairwise comparisons is about 10 billion, which is significant but computationally feasible.",
        "In contrast to unigrams, the difficulty in inducing a comprehensive set of phrase translations is that the number of both source and target phrases is immense.",
        "For example, there are about 83 million unique phrases up to length three in the English Wikipedia.",
        "Pairwise comparisons of two sets of 100 million phrases corresponds to 1 x 10 16 .",
        "Thus, even if we limit the task to short phrases, the number of pairwise phrase comparisons necessary to do an exhaustive search is infeasible.",
        "However, multi-word translation units have been shown to improve the quality of SMT dramatically (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "Phrase translations allow translation models to memorize local context-dependent translations and reordering patterns.",
        "3 Approach Rather than compare all source language phrases with all target language phrases, our approach efficiently proposes a smaller set of hypothesis phrase translations for each source language phrase.",
        "Our method builds upon the notion that many phrase translations can be composed from the translations of its component words and subphrases.",
        "For example Spanish la bruja verde translates into English as the green witch.",
        "Each Spanish word corresponds to exactly one English word.",
        "The phrase pair could be memorized and translated as a unit, or the English translation could be composed from the translations of each Spanish unigram.",
        "Zens et al. (2012) found that only 2% of phrase pairs in German-English, Czech-English, Spanish-English, and French-English phrase tables consist of multi-word source and target phrases and are non-compositional.",
        "That is, for these languages, the vast majority of phrase pairs in a given phrase table could be composed from smaller units.",
        "Our approach takes advantage of the fact that many phrases can be translated compositionally.",
        "We describe our approach in three parts.",
        "In Section 3.1, we begin by inducing translations for unknown unigrams.",
        "Then, in 3.2, we introduce our algorithm for composing phrase translations.",
        "In order to achieve a high recall in our set of hypothesis translations, we define compositionality more loosely than is typical.",
        "Finally, in 3.3, we use comparable corpora to prune the large set of hypothesis translations for each source phrase.",
        "3.1 Unigram Translations In any low resource setting, many word translations are likely to be unknown.",
        "Therefore, before moving to phrases, we use a bilingual lexicon induction technique to identify translations for un-igrams.",
        "Specifically, because we assume a setting where we have some small amount of parallel data, we follow our prior work on supervised bilingual lexicon induction (Irvine and Callison-Burch, 2013b).",
        "We take examples of good translation pairs from our word aligned training data (de- scribed in Section 4) and use random word pairs as negative supervision.",
        "We use this supervision to learn a log-linear classifier that predicts whether a given word pair is a translation or not.",
        "We pair and score all source language unigrams in our tuning and test sets with target language unigrams that appear in our comparable corpora.",
        "Then, for each source language unigram, we use the log-linear model scores to rerank candidate target language unigram translations.",
        "As in our prior work, we include the following word pair features in our log-linear classifier: contextual similarity, temporal similarity, topic similarity, frequency similar-ity, and orthographic similarity.",
        "3.2 Loosely Compositional Translations We propose a novel technique for loosely composing phrasal translations from an existing dictionary of unigram translations and stop word lists.",
        "Given a source language phrase, our approach considers all combinations and all permutations of all unigram translations for each source phrase content word.",
        "We ignore stop words in the input source phrase and allow any number of stop words anywhere in the output target phrase.",
        "In order to make the enumeration efficient, we pre-compute an inverted index that maps sorted target 161 casa houselinda prettylinda cutelinda handsome la casa linda stop words removed casa linda Cartesian product?of unigram translationscute, house handsome, house house, pretty Inverted Index lookups pretty house the pretty house a pretty house cute house house and handsome Bilingual Dictionary: Input Phrase: A B C D Figure 1: Example of loosely composed translations for the Spanish input in A, la casa linda.",
        "In B, we remove the stop word la.",
        "Then, in C, we enumerate the cartesian product of all unigram translations in the bilingual dictionary and sort the words within each alphabetically.",
        "Finally, we look up each list of words in C in the inverted index, and corresponding target phrases are enumerated in D. The inverted index contains all phrasal combinations and permutations of the word lists in C which also appear monolingually with some frequency and with, optionally, any number of stop words.",
        "language content words to sets of phrases containing those words in any order along with, option-ally, any number of stop words.",
        "Our algorithm for composing candidate phrase translations is given in Algorithm 1, and an example translation is composed in Figure 1.",
        "Although in our experiments we compose translations for source phrases up to length three, the algorithm is generally applicable to any set of source phrases of interest.",
        "Algorithm 1 yields a set of target language translations for any source language phrase for which all content unigrams have at least one known translation.",
        "For most phrases, the resulting set of hypothesis translations is very large and the majority are incorrect.",

        "Then, for a given source phrase S m , stop words are removed from the phrase.",
        "Next, the cartesian product of all unigram translations is computed.",
        "Each element in the product is sorted and any corresponding phrases in the inverted index are added to the output.",
        "3.3 Pruning Phrase Pairs Using Scores Derived from Comparable Corpora We further prune the large, noisy set of hypothesized phrase translations before augmenting a seed translation model.",
        "To do so, we use a supervised setup very similar to that used for inducing unigram translations; we estimate a variety of signals that indicate translation equivalence, including temporal, topical, contextual, and string similarity.",
        "As we showed in Klementiev et al. (2012), such signals are effective for identifying phrase translations as well as unigram translations.",
        "We add ngram length, alignment, and unigram translation features to the set, listed in Appendix A.",
        "We learn a log-linear model for combining the features into a single score for predicting the quality of a given phrase pair.",
        "We extract training data from the seed translation model.",
        "We rank hypothesis translations for each source phrase using clas-162 sification scores and keep the top-k. We found that using a score threshold sometimes improves precision.",
        "However, as experiments below show, the recall of the set of phrase pairs is more important, and we did not observe improvements in translation quality when we used a score threshold.",
        "4 Experimental Setup In all of our experiments, we assume that we have access to only a small parallel corpus.",
        "For our Spanish experiments, we randomly sample 2, 000 sentence pairs (about 57, 000 Spanish words) from the Spanish-English Europarl v5 parallel corpus (Koehn, 2005).",
        "For Hindi, we use the parallel corpora released by Post et al. (2012).",
        "Again, we randomly sample 2, 000 sentence pairs from the training corpus (about 39, 000 Hindi words).",
        "We expect that this amount of parallel text could be compiled for a single text domain and any pair of modern languages.",
        "Additionally, we use approximately 2, 500 and 1, 000 single-reference parallel sentences each for tuning and testing our Spanish and Hindi models, respectively.",
        "Spanish tuning and test sets are newswire articles taken from the 2010 WMT shared task (Callison-Burch et al., 2010).",
        "1 We use the Hindi development and testing splits released by Post et al. (2012).",
        "4.1 Unigram Translations Of the 16, 269 unique unigrams in the source side of our Spanish MT tuning and test sets, 73% are OOV with respect to our training corpus.",
        "21% of unigram tokens are OOV.",
        "For Hindi, 61% of the 8, 137 unique unigrams in the tuning and test sets are OOV with respect to our training corpus, and 18% of unigram tokens are OOV.",
        "However, because automatic word alignments estimated over the small parallel training corpora are noisy, we use bilingual lexicon induction to induce translations for all unigrams.",
        "We use the Wikipedia and online news web crawls datasets that we released in Irvine and Callison-Burch (2013b) to estimate similarity scores.",
        "Together, the two datasets contain about 900 million words of Spanish data and about 50 million words of Hindi data.",
        "For both languages, we limit the set of hypothesis target unigram translations to those that appear at least 10 times in our comparable corpora.",
        "We use 3, 000 high probability word translation 1 news-test2008 plus news-syscomb2009 for tuning and newstest2009 for testing.",
        "pairs extracted from each parallel corpus as positive supervision and 9, 000 random word pairs as negative supervision.",
        "We use Vowpal Wabbit 2 for learning.",
        "The top-5 induced translations for each source language word are used as both a baseline set of new translations (Section 6.3) and for composing phrase translations.",
        "4.2 Composing and Pruning Phrase Translations There are about 183 and 66 thousand unique bi-grams and trigrams in the Spanish and Hindi tuning and test sets, respectively.",
        "However, many of these phrases do not demand new hypothesis translations.",
        "We do not translate those which contain numbers or punctuation.",
        "Additionally, for Spanish, we exclude names, which are typically translated identically between Spanish and English.",
        "3 We exclude phrases which are sequences of stop words only.",
        "Additionally, we exclude phrases that appear more than 100 times in the small training corpus because our seed phrase table likely already contains high quality translations for them.",
        "Finally, we exclude phrases that appear fewer than 20 times in our comparable corpora as our features are unreliable when estimated over so few tokens.",
        "We hypothesize translations for the approximately 15 and 6 thousand Spanish and Hindi phrases, respectively, which meet these criteria.",
        "Our approach for inducing translations straightforwardly generalizes to any set of source phrases.",
        "In defining loosely compositional phrase trans-lations, we use both the induced unigram dictionary (Section 3.1) and the dictionary extracted from the word aligned parallel corpus.",
        "We expand these dictionaries further by mapping unigrams to their five-character word prefixes.",
        "We use monolingual corpora of Wikipedia articles 4 to construct stop word lists, containing the most frequent 300 words in each language, and indexes of monolingual phrase frequencies.",
        "There are about 83 million unique phrases up to length three in the English Wikipedia.",
        "However, we ignore target phrases that appear fewer than three times, reducing this set to 10 million English phrases.",

        "Our Hindi model yields even fewer candidate English phrases, 826 for each bigram and 1, 113 for each trigram, on average.",
        "We use the same comparable corpora used for bilingual lexicon induction to estimate features over hypothesis phrase translations.",
        "The full feature set is listed in Appendix A.",
        "We extract supervision from the seed translation models by first identifying phrase pairs with multi-word source strings, that appear at least three times in the training corpus, and that are composeable using baseline model unigram translations and induced dictionaries.",
        "Then, for each language pair, we use the 3, 000 that have the highest ppf |eq scores as positive supervision.",
        "We randomly sample 9, 000 compositional phrase pairs from those not in each phrase table as negative supervision.",
        "Again, we use Vowpal Wabbit for learning a log linear model to score any phrase pair.",
        "4.3 Machine Translation We use GIZA++ to word align each training corpus.",
        "We use the Moses SMT framework (Koehn et al., 2007) and the standard phrase-based MT feature set, including phrase and lexical translation probabilities and a lexicalized reordering model.",
        "When we augment our models with new transla-tions, we use the average reordering scores over all bilingually estimated phrase pairs.",
        "We tune all models using batch MIRA (Cherry and Fos-ter, 2012).",
        "We average results over three tuning runs and use approximate randomization to measure statistical significance (Clark et al., 2011).",
        "For Spanish, we use a 5-gram language model trained on the English side of the complete Europarl corpus and for Hindi a 5-gram language model trained on the English side of the complete training corpus released by Post et al. (2012).",
        "We train our language models using SRILM with Kneser-Ney smoothing.",
        "Our baseline models use a phrase limit of three, and we augment them with translations of phrases up to length three in our experiments.",
        "5 Oracle Experiment Before moving to the results of our proposed approach for composing phrase translations, we present an oracle experiment to answer these research questions: Would a low resource translation model benefit from composing its unigram translations into phrases?",
        "Would this be further improved by adding unigram translations that are learned from monolingual texts?",
        "We answer these questions by starting with our low-resource Spanish-English and Hindi-English baselines and augmenting each with (1) phrasal translations composed from baseline model unigram translations, and (2) phrasal translations composed of a mix of baseline model unigram translations and the monolingually-induced unigrams.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates how our hallucinated phrase-table entries can result in improved translation quality for Spanish to English translation.",
        "Since the baseline model is trained from such a small amount of data, it typically translates individual words instead of phrases.",
        "In our augmented sys-tem, we compose a translation of was no one from habia nadie, since habia translates as was in the baseline model, nadie translates as one, and no is a stop word.",
        "We are able to monolingually-induce translations for the OOVs centros and electorales before composing the phrase translation polling stations for centros electorales.",
        "In our oracle experiments, composed translations are only added to the phrase table if they are contained in the reference.",
        "This eliminates the huge number of noisy translations that our compositional algorithm generates.",
        "We augment baseline models with translations for the same sets of source language phrases described in Section 4.",
        "We use GIZA++ to word align our tuning and test sets 5 and use a standard phrase pair extraction heuristic 6 to identify oracle phrase translations.",
        "We add oracle translations to each baseline model without bilingually estimated translation scores 7 because such scores are not available for our automatically induced translations.",
        "Instead, we score the oracle phrase pairs using the 30 new phrase table features described in Section 3.3.",
        "Table 1 shows the results of our oracle experiments.",
        "Augmenting the baselines with the subset of oracle translations which are composed given the unigram translations in the baseline models themselves (i.e. in the small training sets) yields 5 For both languages, we learn an alignment over our tuning and test sets and complete parallel training sets.",
