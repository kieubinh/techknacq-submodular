        "Such representations are referred to as distributed word representations or word embeddings, as they embed an entire vocabulary into a relatively low-dimensional linear space, whose dimensions are latent continuous features.",
        "The embedded word vectors are trained over large collections of text using variants of neural networks (Bengio et al., 2003; Collobert and Weston, 2008; Mnih and Hinton, 2008; Mikolov et al., 2011; Mikolov et al., 2013b).",

        "The effect is grouping of words that share semantic (?dog cat cow?, ?eat devour?)",
        "or syntactic (?cars hats days?, ?emptied carried danced?)",
        "properties, and are shown to be effective as features for various NLP tasks (Turian et al., 2010; Collobert et al., 2011; Socher et al., 2011; Al-Rfou et al., 2013).",
        "We refer to such word representations as neural embeddings or just embeddings.",
        "Recently, Mikolov et al. (2013c) demonstrated that the embeddings created by a recursive neural network (RNN) encode not only attributional similarities between words, but also similarities between pairs of words.",
        "Such similarities are referred to as linguistic regularities by Mikolov et al. and as relational similarities by Turney (2006).",
        "They capture, for example, the gender relation exhibited by the pairs ?man:woman?, ?king:queen?, the language-spoken-in relation in ?france:french?, ?mexico:spanish?",
        "and the past-tense relation in ?capture:captured?, ?go:went?.",
        "Remarkably, Mikolov et al. showed that such relations are reflected in vector offsets between word pairs (apples ?",
        "apple ?",
        "cars ?",
        "car), and that by using simple vector arithmetic one could apply the relation and solve analogy questions of the form ?a is to a ?",
        "as b is to ??",
        "in which the nature of the relation is hidden.",
        "Perhaps the most famous example is that the embedded representation of the word queen can be roughly recovered from the representations of king, man and woman: queen ?",
        "king ?man+ woman The recovery of relational similarities using vector arithmetic on RNN-embedded vectors was evaluated on many relations, achieving state-of-the-art results in relational similarity identification tasks 171 (Mikolov et al., 2013c; Zhila et al., 2013).",
        "It was later demonstrated that relational similarities can be recovered in a similar fashion also from embeddings trained with different architectures (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Mikolov et al., 2013b).",
        "This fascinating result raises a question: to what extent are the relational semantic properties a result of the embedding process?",
        "Experiments in (Mikolov et al., 2013c) show that the RNN-based embeddings are superior to other dense represen-tations, but how crucial is it for a representation to be dense and low-dimensional at all?",
        "An alternative approach to representing words as vectors is the distributional similarity repre-sentation, or bag of contexts.",
        "In this representa-tion, each word is associated with a very high-dimensional but sparse vector capturing the contexts in which the word occurs.",
        "We call such vector representations explicit, as each dimension directly corresponds to a particular context.",
        "These explicit vector-space representations have been extensively studied in the NLP literature (see (Tur- ney and Pantel, 2010; Baroni and Lenci, 2010) and the references therein), and are known to exhibit a large extent of attributional similarity (Pereira et al., 1993; Lin, 1998; Lin and Pantel, 2001; Sahlgren, 2006; Kotlerman et al., 2010).",
        "In this study, we show that similarly to the neural embedding space, the explicit vector space also encodes a vast amount of relational similarity which can be recovered in a similar fashion, suggesting the explicit vector space representation as a competitive baseline for further work on neural embeddings.",
        "Moreover, this result implies that the neural embedding process is not discovering novel patterns, but rather is doing a remarkable job at preserving the patterns inherent in the word-context co-occurrence matrix.",
        "A key insight of this work is that the vector arithmetic method can be decomposed into a linear combination of three pairwise similarities (Section 3).",
        "While mathematically equivalent, we find that thinking about the method in terms of the decomposed formulation is much less puzzling, and provides a better intuition on why we would expect the method to perform well on the analogy recovery task.",
        "Furthermore, the decomposed form leads us to suggest a modified optimization objective (Section 6), which outperforms the state-of-the-art at recovering relational similarities under both representations.",
        "2 Explicit Vector Space Representation We adopt the traditional word representation used in the distributional similarity literature (Turney and Pantel, 2010).",
        "Each word is associated with a sparse vector capturing the contexts in which it occurs.",
        "We call this representation explicit, as each dimension corresponds to a particular context.",
        "For a vocabulary V and a set of contexts C, the result is a |V |?|C| sparse matrix S in which S ij corresponds to the strength of the association between word i and context j.",

        "V and a context c ?",
        "C can take many forms.",

        "The use of PMI in distributional similarity models was introduced by Church and Hanks (1990) and widely adopted (Dagan et al., 1994; Turney, 2001).",
        "The PPMI variant dates back to at least (Niwa and Nitta, 1994), and was demonstrated to perform very well in Bullinaria and Levy (2007).",
        "In this work, we take the linear contexts in which words appear.",
        "We consider each word surrounding the target word w in a window of 2 to each side as a context, distinguishing between different sequential positions.",
        "For example, in the sentence a b c d e the contexts of the word c are a ?2 , b ?1 , d +1 and e +2 .",

        "), with a mean of 1595 and a median of 415.",
        "Another popular choice of context is the syntactic relations the word participates in (Lin, 1998; PadÃ³ and Lapata, 2007; Levy and Goldberg, 2014).",

        "?man:woman?, ?king:queen?).",

        "; it has several aspects, high-level properties that it implies, such as royalty or (male) gender, and its attributional similarity with another word is based on a mixture of those aspects; e.g. king is related to queen on the royalty and the human axes, and shares the gender and the human aspect with man.",

        "In ?man is to woman as king is to queen?, the two main aspects are gender and royalty.",
        "Solving the analogy question involves identifying the relevant aspects, and trying to change one of them while preserving the other.",

        "represented in the vector space?",
        "While the neural embeddings are mostly opaque, one of the appealing properties of explicit vector representations is our ability to read and understand the vectors?",

        "The prevalence of rare words stems from PMI, which gives them more weight, and from the fact that words like woman and queen are closely related (a queen is a woman), and thus have many features in common.",
        "Ordering the features of woman queen by prevalence reveals female pronouns (?she?, ?her?)",
        "and a long list of common feminine names, reflecting the expected aspect shared by woman and queen.",

        "aspect is captured with many regional possessives (?america?s?, ?asia?s?, ?world?s?).",
        "10 Related Work Relational similarity (and answering analogy questions) was previously tackled using explicit representations.",
        "Previous approaches use task-specific information, by either relying on a (word-pair, connectives) matrix rather than the standard (word, context) matrix (Turney and Littman, 2005; Turney, 2006), or by treating analogy detection as a supervised learning task (Ba- roni and Lenci, 2009; Jurgens et al., 2012; Turney, 2013).",
        "In contrast, the vector arithmetic approach followed here is unsupervised, and works on a generic single-word representation.",
        "Even though the training process is oblivious to the task of analogy detection, the resulting representation is able to detect them quite accurately.",
        "Turney (2012) assumes a similar setting but with two types of word similarities, and combines them with products and ratios (similar to 3COSMUL) to recover a variety of semantic relations, including analogies.",
        "Arithmetic combination of explicit word vectors is extensively studied in the context of compositional semantics (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010), where a phrase composed of two or more words is represented by a single vector, computed by a function of its component word vectors.",
        "Blacoe and Lapata (2012) compare different arithmetic functions across multiple representations (includ- ing embeddings) on a range of compositionality benchmarks.",
        "To the best of our knowledge such methods of word vector arithmetic have not been explored for recovering relational similarities in explicit representations.",
        "11 Discussion Mikolov et al. showed how an unsupervised neural network can represent words in a space that ?nat- urally?",
        "encodes relational similarities in the form of vector offsets.",
        "This study shows that finding analogies through vector arithmetic is actually a form of balancing word similarities, and that, contrary to the recent findings of Baroni et al. (2014), under certain conditions traditional word similarities induced by explicit representations can perform just as well as neural embeddings on this task.",
        "Learning to represent words is a fascinating and important challenge with implications to most current NLP efforts, and neural embeddings in particular are a promising research direction.",
        "We believe that to improve these representations we should understand how they work, and hope that the methods and insights provided in this work will help to deepen our grasp of current and future investigations of word representations.",
