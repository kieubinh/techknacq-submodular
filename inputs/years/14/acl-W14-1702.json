        "Grammatical error correction has attracted considerable interest in the last few years, especially through a series of ?shared tasks?.",
        "These efforts have helped to provide a common ground for evaluating and comparing systems while encouraging research in the field.",
        "These shared tasks have primarily focused on English as a second or foreign language and addressed different error types.",
        "The HOO 2011 task (Dale and Kilgarriff, 2011), for example, included all error types whereas HOO 2012 (Dale et al., 2012) and the CoNLL 2013 shared task (Ng et al., 2013) were restricted to only two and five types respectively.",
        "In this paper, we describe our submission to the CoNLL 2014 shared task (Ng et al., 2014), which involves correcting all the errors in essays written in English by students at the National University of Singapore.",
        "An all-type task poses a greater challenge, since correcting open-class types (such as spelling or collocation errors) requires different correction strategies than those in closed classes (such as determiners or prepositions).",
        "In this scenario, hybrid systems or combinations of correction modules seem more appropriate and typically produce good results.",
        "In fact, most of the participating teams in previous shared tasks have used a combination of modules or systems for their submissions, even for correcting closed-class types (Dahlmeier et al., 2011; Bhaskar et al., 2011; Rozovskaya et al., 2011; Ivanova et al., 2011; Rozovskaya et al., 2013; Yoshimoto et al., 2013; Xing et al., 2013; Kunchukuttan et al., 2013; Putra and Szabo, 2013; Xiang et al., 2013).",
        "In line with previous research, we present a hybrid approach that employs a rule-based error correction system and an ad-hoc statistical machine translation (SMT) system, as well as a large-scale language model to rank alternative corrections and an error type filtering technique.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organised as fol-lows: Section 2 describes our approach and each component in detail, Section 3 presents our experiments using the CoNLL 2014 shared task development set and Section 4 reports our official results on the test set.",
        "Finally, we discuss the performance of our system and present an error analysis in Section 5 and conclude in Section 6.",
        "2 Approach We tackle the error correction task using a pipeline of processes that combines results from multiple systems.",
        "Figure 1 shows the interaction of the components in our final hybrid system, producing the results submitted to the CoNLL 2014 shared task.",
        "The following sections describe each of these components in detail.",
        "2.1 Rule-based error correction system (RBS) The rule-based system is a component of the Self-Assessment and Tutoring (SAT) system, a web service developed at the University of Cambridge aimed at helping intermediate learners of English 15 Figure 1: Overview of components and interactions in our final hybrid system.",
        "in their writing tasks 1 (Andersen et al., 2013).",
        "The original SAT system provides three main function-alities: 1) text assessment, producing an overall score for a piece of text, 2) sentence evaluation, producing a sentence-level quality score, and 3) word-level feedback, suggesting specific corrections for frequent errors.",
        "Since the focus of the shared task is on strict correction (as opposed to detection), we only used the word-level feedback component of the SAT system.",
        "This module uses rules automatically derived from the Cambridge Learner Corpus 2 (CLC) (Nicholls, 2003) that are aimed at detecting error-ful unigrams, bigrams and trigrams.",
        "In order to ensure high precision, rules are based on n-grams that have been annotated as incorrect at least five times and at least ninety per cent of the times they occur.",
        "In addition to these corpus-derived rules, many cases of incorrect but plausible deriva-tional and inflectional morphology are detected by means of rules derived from a machine-readable dictionary.",
        "For further details on specific compo-nents, we refer the reader to the aforementioned paper.",
        "Given an input text, the rule-based system produces an XML file containing a list of suggested corrections.",
        "These corrections can either be applied to the original text or used to generate multiple correction candidates, as described in Section 2.3.",
        "2.2 SMT system We follow a similar approach to the one described by Yuan and Felice (2013) in order to train an SMT 1 The latest version of the system, called ?Write & Improve?, is available at http://www.cambridge english.org/writeandimprovebeta/.",

        "from incorrect into correct English.",
        "Our training data comprises a set of different parallel corpora, where the original (in- correct) sentences constitute the source side and corrected versions based on gold standard annotations constitute the target side.",
        "These corpora include: ?",
        "the NUCLE v3.1 corpus (Dahlmeier et al., 2013), containing around 1,400 essays written in English by students at the National University of Singapore (approx.",
        "1,220,257 tokens in 57,152 sentences), ?",
        "phrase alignments involving corrections extracted automatically from the NUCLE corpus (with up to 7 tokens per side), which are used to boost the probability of phrase alignments that involve corrections so as to improve recall, ?",
        "the CoNLL 2014 shared task development set, containing 50 essays from the previous year's test set (approx.",
        "29,207 tokens in 1,382 sentences), ?",
        "the First Certificate in English (FCE) corpus (Yannakoudakis et al., 2011), containing 1,244 exam scripts and 2 essays per script (approx.",
        "532,033 tokens in 16,068 sen-tences), ?",
        "a subset of the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) examination dataset extracted from the CLC corpus, containing 2,498 exam scripts and 2 essays per script (approx.",
        "1,361,841 tokens in 64,628 sentences), and ?",
        "a set of sentences from the English Vocabulary Profile 3 (EVP), which have been modified to include artificially generated errors (approx.",
        "351,517 tokens in 18,830 sen-tences).",
        "The original correct sentences are a subset of the CLC and come from examinations at different proficiency levels.",
        "The artificial error generation method aims at replicating frequent error patterns observed in the NUCLE corpus on error-free sentences, as described by Yuan and Felice (2013).",
        "3 Sentences were automatically scraped from http:// www.englishprofile.org/index.php?option= com_content&view=article&id=4&Itemid=5 16 Word alignment was carried out using pialign (Neubig et al., 2011), after we found it outperformed GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000; Och and Ney, 2003) and Berkeley Aligner (Liang et al., 2006; DeNero and Klein, 2007) in terms of precision and F 0.5 on the development set.",
        "Instead of using heuristics to extract phrases from the word alignments learnt by GIZA++ or Berker-ley Aligner, pialign created a phrase table directly from model probabilities.",
        "In addition to the features already defined by pi-align, we added character-level Levenshtein distance to each mapping in the phrase table.",
        "This was done to allow for the fact that, in error correc-tion, most words translate into themselves and errors are often similar to their correct forms.",
        "Equal weights were assigned to these features.",
        "We then built a lexical reordering model using the alignments created by pialign.",
        "The maximum phrase length was set to 7, as recommended in the SMT literature (Koehn et al., 2003; Koehn, 2014).",
        "The IRSTLM Toolkit (Federico et al., 2008) was used to build a 4-gram target language model with Kneser?Ney smoothing (Kneser and Ney, 1995) on the correct sentences from the NUCLE, full CLC and EVP corpora.",
        "Decoding was performed with Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), using the default settings and weights.",
        "No tuning process was applied.",
        "The resulting system was used to produce the 10 best correction candidates for each sentence in the dataset, which were further processed by other modules.",
        "Segmentation, tokenisation and part-of-speech tagging were performed using NLTK (Bird et al., 2009) for consistency with the shared task datasets.",
        "2.3 Candidate generation In order to integrate corrections from multiple sys-tems, we developed a method to generate all the possible corrected versions of a sentence (candi- dates).",
        "Candidates are generated by computing all possible combinations of corrections (irrespective of the system from which they originate), including the original tokens to allow for a ?no correc-tion?",
        "option.",
        "The list of candidates produced for each sentence always includes the original (un- modified) sentence plus any other versions derived from system corrections.",
        "In order for a combination of corrections to generate a valid candidate, all the corrections must be Figure 2: An example showing the candidate generation process.",

        "CE: correct ed-its, ME: missed edits, UE: unnecessary edits, P: precision, R: recall.",
        "compatible; otherwise, the candidate is discarded.",
        "We consider two or more corrections to be compatible if they do not overlap, in an attempt to avoid introducing accidental errors.",
        "In addition, if different correction sets produce the same can-didate, we only keep one.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates the candidate generation process.",
        "2.4 Language model ranking Generated candidates are ranked using a language model (LM), with the most probable candidate being selected as the final corrected version.",
        "We tried two different alternatives for ranking: 1) using the target LM embedded in our SMT system (described in Section 2.2) and 2) using a large n-gram LM built from web data.",
        "In the latter case, we used Microsoft Web N-gram Services, which provide access to large smoothed n-gram language models (with n=2,3,4,5) built from web documents (Gao et al., 2010).",
        "All our experiments are based on the 5-gram ?bing-body:apr10?",
        "model.",
        "The ranking performance of these two models was evaluated on the 10-best hypotheses generated by the SMT system for each sentence in the development set.",
        "Table 1 shows the results from the M 2 Scorer (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012), the official scorer for the shared task that, unlike previous ver-sions, weights precision twice as much as recall.",
        "Results show that using Microsoft's Web LM yields better performance, which is unsurprising given the vast amounts of data used to build that 17 System CE ME UE P R F 0.5 RBS 95 3322 107 0.4703 0.0278 0.1124 SMT 452 2965 690 0.3958 0.1323 0.2830 Table 2: Results of individual systems on the development set.",
        "model.",
        "For this reason, we adopt Microsoft's model for all further experiments.",
        "We also note that without normalisation, higher probabilities may be assigned to shorter sentences, which can introduce a bias towards preferring deletions or skipping insertions.",
        "2.5 Type filtering Analysing performance by error type is very valuable for system development and tuning.",
        "How-ever, this can only be performed for corrections in the gold standard (either matched or missed).",
        "To estimate types for unnecessary corrections, we defined a set of heuristics that analyse differences in word forms and part-of-speech tags between the original phrases and their system corrections, based on common patterns observed in the training data.",
        "We had previously used a similar strategy to classify errors in our CoNLL 2013 shared task submission (Yuan and Felice, 2013) but have now included a few improvements and rules for new types.",
        "Estimation accuracy is 50.92% on the training set and 67.57% on the development set, which we consider to be acceptable for our purposes given that the final test set is more similar to the development set.",
        "Identifying types for system corrections is not only useful during system development but can also be exploited to filter out and reduce the number of proposed corrections.",
        "More specifically, if a system proposes a much higher number of unnecessary corrections than correct suggestions for a specific error type, we can assume the system is actually degrading the quality of the original text, in which case it is preferable to filter out those error types.",
        "Such decisions will lower the total number of unnecessary edits, thus improving overall precision.",
        "However, they will also harm recall, unless the number of matched corrections for the error type is zero (i.e. unless P type = 0).",
        "To avoid this, only corrections for types having zero precision should be removed.",
        "3 Experiments and results We carried out a series of experiments on the development set using different pipelines and combinations of systems in order to find an optimal setting.",
        "The following sections describe them in detail.",
        "3.1 Individual system performance Our first set of experiments were aimed at investigating individual system performance on the development set, which is reported in Table 2.",
        "Results show that the SMT system has much better performance, which is expected given that it has been trained on texts similar to those in the test set.",
        "3.2 Pipelines Since corrections from the RBS and SMT systems are often complementary, we set out to explore combination schemes that would integrate corrections from both systems.",
        "Table 3 shows results for different combinations, where RBS and SMT indicate all corrections from the respective systems, subscript ?c?",
        "indicates candidates generated from a system's individual corrections, subscript ?10- best?",
        "indicates the 10-best list of candidates produced by the SMT system, ?>?",
        "indicates a pipeline where the output of one system is the input to the other and ?+?",
        "indicates a combination of candidates from different systems.",
        "All these pipelines use the RBS system as the first processing step in order to perform an initial correction, which is extremely beneficial for the SMT system.",
        "Results reveal that the differences between these pipelines are small in terms of F 0.5 , although there are noticeable variations in precision and recall.",
        "The best results are achieved when the 10 best hypotheses from the SMT system are ranked with Microsoft's LM, which confirms our results in Table 1 showing that the SMT LM is outperformed by a larger web-based model.",
        "A simple pipeline using the RBS system first and the SMT system second (#3) yields performance that is better than (or comparable to) pipelines #1, #2 and #4, suggesting that there is no real benefit in using more sophisticated pipelines when only the best hypothesis from the SMT system is used.",
        "However, performance is improved when the 10 best SMT hypotheses are considered.",
        "The only difference between pipelines #5 and #6 lies in the way corrections from the RBS system 18 # Pipeline CE ME UE P R F 0.5 ?",
        "1 RBS > SMT c > LM 372 3045 481 0.4361 0.1088 0.2723 2 RBS c + SMT c > LM 400 3017 485 0.4520 0.1171 0.2875 3 RBS > SMT 476 2941 738 0.3921 0.1393 0.2877 4 RBS c > LM > SMT 471 2946 718 0.3961 0.1378 0.2881 5 RBS > SMT 10-best > LM 678 2739 1368 0.3314 0.1984 0.2922 6 RBS c > LM > SMT 10-best > LM 681 2736 1366 0.3327 0.1993 0.2934 Table 3: Results for different system pipelines on the development set.",

        "are handled.",
        "In the first case, all corrections are applied at once whereas in the second, the suggested corrections are used to generate candidates that are subsequently ranked by our LM, often discarding some of the suggested corrections.",
        "3.3 Filtering As described in Section 2.5, we can evaluate performance by error type in order to identify and remove unnecessary corrections.",
        "In particular, we tried to optimise our best hybrid system (#6) by filtering out types with zero precision.",
        "Table 5 shows type-specific performance for this system, where three zero-precision types can be identi-fied: Reordering (a subset of Others that we treat separately), Srun (run-ons/comma splices) and Wa (acronyms).",
        "Although reordering was explicitly disabled in our SMT system, a translation table can still include this type of mappings if they are observed in the training data (e.g. ?you also can?",
        "?",
        "?you can also?).",
        "In order to remove such undesired corrections, the following procedure was applied: first, individual corrections were extracted by comparing the original and corrected sentences; second, the type of each extracted correction was pre-dicted, subsequently deleting those that matched unwanted types (i.e. reordering, Srun or Wa); fi-nally, the set of remaining corrections was applied to the original text.",
        "This method improves precision while preserving recall (see Table 4), although the resulting improvement is not statistically significant (paired t-test, p > 0.05).",
        "4 Official evaluation results Our submission to the CoNLL 2014 shared task is the result of our best hybrid system, described in the previous section and summarised in Figure 1.",
        "The official test set comprised 50 new essays (ap- prox.",
        "30,144 tokens in 1,312 sentences) written in response to two prompts, one of which was also included in the training data.",
        "Systems were evaluated using the M 2 Scorer, which uses F 0.5 as its overall measure.",
        "As in previous years, there were two evaluation rounds.",
        "The first one was based on the original gold-standard annotations provided by the shared-task organisers whereas the second was based on a revised version including alternative annotations submitted by the participating teams.",
        "Our submitted system achieved the first and second place respectively.",
        "The official results of our submission in both evaluation rounds are reported in Table 6.",
        "5 Discussion and error analysis In order to assess how our system performed per error type on the test set, we ran our type estimation script and obtained the results shown in Table 7.",
        "Although these results are estimated and therefore not completely accurate, 4 they can still provide valuable insights, at least at a coarse level.",
        "The following sections discuss our main findings.",
        "5.1 Type performance According to Table 7, our system achieves the best performance for types WOadv (adverb/adjective position) and Wtone (tone), but these results are 4 Estimation accuracy was found to be 57.90% on the test set.",

        "We also note that Reordering and Srun errors, which had explicitly been filtered out, still appear in our final results, 20 which is due to differences in the edit extraction algorithms used by the M 2 Scorer and our own implementation.",
        "According to our estimations, our system has poor performance on the Wci type (the second most frequent), suggesting it is not very successful at correcting idioms and collocations.",
        "Corrections for more complex error types such as Um (unclear meaning), which are beyond the scope of this shared task, are inevitably missed.",
        "5.2 Deletions We have also observed that many mismatches between our system's corrections and the gold standard are caused by unnecessary deletions, as in the following example: ORIGINAL SENTENCE: I could understand the feeling of the carrier .",
        "SYSTEM HYPOTHESIS: I understand the feeling of the carrier .",
        "GOLD STANDARD: I could understand the feeling of the carrier .",
        "(unchanged) This effect is the result of using 10-best hypotheses from the SMT system together with LM ranking.",
        "Hypotheses from an SMT system can include many malformed sentences which are effectively discarded by the embedded target language model and additional heuristics.",
        "However, ranking these raw hypotheses with external systems can favour deletions, as language models will generally assign higher probabilities to shorter sentences.",
        "A common remedy for this is normalisation but we found it made no difference in our experiments.",
        "In other cases, deletions can be ascribed to differences in the domain of the training and test sets, as observed in this example: ORIGINAL SENTENCE: Nowadays , social media are able to disseminate information faster than any other media .",
        "SYSTEM HYPOTHESIS: Nowadays , the media are able to disseminate information faster than any other media .",
        "GOLD STANDARD: Nowadays , social media are able to disseminate information faster than any other media .",
        "(unchanged) 5.3 Uncredited corrections Our analysis also reveals a number of cases where the system introduces changes that are not included in the gold standard but we consider improve the quality of a sentence.",
        "For example: ORIGINAL SENTENCE: Demon is not easily to be defeated and it is required much of energy and psychological support .",
        "SYSTEM HYPOTHESIS: Demon is not easily defeated and it requires a lot of energy and psychological support .",
        "GOLD STANDARD: The demon is not easily defeated and it requires much energy and psychological support .",
        "Adding alternative corrections to the gold standard alleviates this problem, although the list of alternatives will inevitably be incomplete.",
        "There are also a number of cases where the sentences are considered incorrect as part of a longer text but are acceptable when they are evaluated in isolation.",
        "Consider the following examples: ORIGINAL SENTENCE: The opposite is also true .",
        "SYSTEM HYPOTHESIS: The opposite is true .",
        "GOLD STANDARD: The opposite is also true .",
        "(unchanged) ORIGINAL SENTENCE: It has erased the boundaries of distance and time .",
        "SYSTEM HYPOTHESIS: It has erased the boundaries of distance and time .",
        "(unchanged) GOLD STANDARD: They have erased the boundaries of distance and time .",
        "In both cases, system hypotheses are perfectly grammatical but they are considered incorrect when analysed in context.",
        "Such mismatch is the result of discrepancies between the annotation and evaluation criteria: while the gold standard is annotated taking discourse into account, system cor-21 rections are proposed in isolation, completely devoid of discursive context.",
        "Finally, the inability of the M 2 Scorer to combine corrections from different annotators (as opposed to selecting only one annotator's corrections for the whole sentence) can also result in underestimations of performance.",
        "However, it is clear that exploring these combinations during evaluation is a challenging task itself.",
        "6 Conclusions We have presented a hybrid approach to error correction that combines a rule-based and an SMT error correction system.",
        "We have explored different combination strategies, including sequential pipelines, candidate generation and ranking.",
        "In addition, we have demonstrated that error type estimations can be used to filter out unnecessary corrections and improve precision without harming recall.",
        "Results of our best hybrid system on the official CoNLL 2014 test set yield F 0.5 =0.3733 for the original annotations and F 0.5 =0.4355 for alternative corrections, placing our system in the first and second place respectively.",
        "Error analysis reveals that our system is particularly good at correcting mechanical errors and agreement but is often penalised for unnecessary deletions.",
        "However, a thorough inspection shows that the system tends to produce very fluent sen-tences, even if they do not match gold standard annotations.",
