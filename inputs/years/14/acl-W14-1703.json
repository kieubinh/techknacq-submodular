        "There has been an increasing interest in using statistical machine translation (SMT) for the task of grammatical error correction.",
        "Among the 16 teams that took part in the CoNLL-2013 Shared Task (Ng et al., 2013), four teams described approaches that fully or partially used SMT in their system.",
        "While in the previous year the correction task was restricted to just five error types, the CoNLL-2014 Shared Task (Ng et al., 2014) now requires a participating system to correct all 28 error types present in NUCLE (Dahlmeier et al., 2013).",
        "Since the high number of error types has made it harder to target each error category with dedicated components, SMT with its ability to learn generic text transformations is now an even more appealing approach.",
        "With out-of-the-box machine translation toolkits like Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) being freely available, the application of SMT to grammatical error correction seems straightforward.",
        "How-ever, Moses has not been designed as a grammar correction system, the standard features and optimization methods are geared towards translation performance measured by the metrics used in the SMT field.",
        "Training Moses on data that is relevant for grammatical error correction is a step in the right direction, but data alone is not enough.",
        "The decoder needs to be able to judge the data based on relevant features, parameter optimization needs to be performed according to relevant metrics.",
        "This paper constitutes the description of the Adam Mickiewicz University (AMU) submission to the CoNLL-2014 Shared Task on Grammatical Error Correction.",
        "We explore the interaction of large-scale data, parameter optimization, and task-specific features in a Moses-based system.",
        "Related work is presented in the next section, the system setup is shortly described in Section 3.",
        "Sections 4 to 7 contain our main contributions.",
        "In Section 4, we describe our implementation of feature weights tuning according to the MaxMatch (M 2 ) metric by Dahlmeier and Ng (2012b) which is the evaluation metric of the current CoNLL-2014 Shared Task.",
        "Sections 5 and 6 deal with the data-intensive aspects of our paper.",
        "We start by extending the baseline system with a Wikipedia-based language model and finish with a web-scale language model estimated from CommonCrawl data.",
        "Uncorrected/corrected data from the social language learner's platform Lang-8 is used to extend the translation models of our system.",
        "Task-specific dense and sparse features are introduced in Section 7.",
        "These features are meant to raise the ?awareness?",
        "of the decoder for grammatical error correction.",
        "In Section 8, we discuss the results of our submission and several intermediate systems on the blind CoNLL-2014 test set.",
        "25 2 Related Work Brockett et al. (2006) use SMT to correct countability errors for a set of 14 mass nouns that pose problems to Chinese ESL learners.",
        "For this very restricted task they achieve a results of 61.81% corrected mistakes.",
        "This work mentions minimum error rate tuning according to BLEU.",
        "A Moses-based system is described by Mizumoto et al. (2011) who correct grammatical errors of learners of Japanese.",
        "This work is continued for English in Mizumoto et al. (2012).",
        "The effect of learner corpus size on various types of grammatical errors is investigated.",
        "The additional large-scale data originates from the social learner's platform Lang-8.",
        "We use similar resources.",
        "Very interesting work is presented by Dahlmeier and Ng (2012a).",
        "A custom beam-search decoder for grammatical error correction is introduced that incorporates discriminative classifiers for specific error categories such as articles and prepositions.",
        "The authors perform parameter tuning and find PRO to work better with M 2 1 than MERT 1 .",
        "The specialized decoder tuned with M 2 1 is compared to Moses that has been tuned with BLEU.",
        "As we show in Section 4.2, this cannot be a fair comparison.",
        "The CoNLL-2013 Shared Task (Ng et al., 2013) saw a number of systems based entirely or partially on translation approaches.",
        "Most notable are Yuan and Felice (2013) and Yoshimoto et al. (2013).",
        "Yuan and Felice (2013) apply Moses to all five error types of the shared task and extend the provided training data by adding other learner's corpora.",
        "They also experiment with generating artificial errors.",
        "Improvement over the baseline are small, but their approach to generate errors shows promise.",
        "We successfully re-implement their baseline.",
        "Yoshimoto et al. (2013) use Moses for two error classes, prepositions and determin-ers, for other classes they find classifier-based approaches and treelet language models to perform better.",
        "None of the CoNLL-2013 SMT-based systems seems to use parameter tuning.",
        "3 General System Setup Our system is based on the phrase-based part of the statistical machine translation system Moses (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "Only plain text data is used for language model and translation model training.",
        "1 This is different from our findings for Moses, but may be a property of their custom decoder.",
        "External linguistic knowledge is introduced during parameter tuning as the tuning metric relies on the error annotation present in NUCLE.",
        "Phrase tables are binarized with the compact phrase table (Junczys-Dowmunt, 2012), no reordering models are used, the distortion limit is set to 0, effectively prohibiting any reordering.",
        "Apart from that, our basic setup is very similar to that of Yuan and Felice (2013).",
        "We adapted their 4-fold cross validation scheme on NUCLE to our needs and use a similar baseline, now with 28 error types.",
        "4 Parameter Tuning The training of feature functions like translation models or language models is only half the work required to produce a state-of-the-art statistical machine translation system.",
        "The other half relies on parameter tuning.",
        "During translation, Moses scores translations e of string f by a log-linear model log p(e|f) = ?",
        "i ?",
        "i log(h i (e, f)) where h i are feature functions and ?",
        "i are feature weights.",
        "Without parameter tuning, results may be questionable as the choice of feature function weights (everything else being identical) can turn a mediocre system into a high-scoring system or render a good system useless.",
        "This is illustrated in Section 4.2 and by examples throughout the paper.",
        "All our modifications to MERT, PRO, kb-MIRA discussed in this section are publicly available 2 .",
        "4.1 Tuning Scheme To accommodate for parameter tuning, we modify the standard 4-fold cross validation procedure.",
        "The test set in each of the four training/testing runs is again divided into two halves.",
        "The first half is treated as a tuning set, the second half as a test set.",
        "Next, tuning set and test set are inverted in order to tune and test a second time.",
        "Altogether, we perform four separate translation model training steps and eight tuning/testing steps.",
        "Each tuning/test set consists of ca. 7,000 sentences.",
        "We call this procedure 4?2-fold cross validation (4?2-CV).",
        "This way the entire NUCLE corpus serves as training, test, and tuning set.",
        "We also evaluate all our results on the CoNLL-2013 gold standard (ST-2013) which has been made available with 28 error types after the previous shared task.",

        "Moses is bundled with several tuning tools that can tune parameter vectors according to different MT tuning metrics.",
        "The most widely used is BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).",
        "We first attempt minimum error rate tuning (MERT) (Och, 2003) with BLEU, results are shown in Table 1.",
        "While BLEU scores increase on both, 4?2-CV and ST-2013, the effect on M 2 0.5 is catastrophic 3 though not surprising.",
        "The baseline is so weak that it introduces more errors than corrections, thus lowering the similarity of the output and the reference below the level of the similarity of the input and the reference.",
        "MERT learns parameter weights that disable nearly all correction attempts.",
        "The obvious solution is to tune directly with M 2 .",
        "M 2 provides per-sentence sufficient statistics and can easily 4 be integrated with MERT.",
        "We retune with M 2 and see an improvement on 4?2-CV but a significant decrease for ST-2013.",
        "BLEU increases for this system despite the drop in M 2 .",
        "This seems contradictory, but actually proves our point about the necessity of parameter tuning.",
        "Good luck should not be a basis for choosing pa-rameters, in the case of a blind submission we have a much better chance to reach good results betting on optimized parameters.",
        "As we see later, this situation does not occur again for the more advanced systems, tuned parameters do generally better.",
        "4.3 Parameter Smoothing Based on the results of Clark et al. (2011), it has become good practice to tune systems between three and five times and report average results in order to cope with optimizer instability.",
        "Cettolo et al. (2011) expand on this work and explore param-3 Which might explain why none of the Moses-based CoNLL-2013 systems used parameter tuning.",
        "4 We run the original m2scorer Python code with an embedded Python interpreter in MERT's C++ source code.",

        "They report that parameter vector centroids averaged over several tuning runs yield better than average results and reduce variation.",
        "Tuning three to five times would require 24 to 40 tuning runs in our setup.",
        "However, we already have eight parameter vectors obtained from distinct tuning sets and decide to average these parameters.",
        "This way we hope to obtain a single vector of smoothed parameters that represents the entire NUCLE corpus.",
        "Eventually, we retranslate the test sets according to 4-fold cross validation using the respective training data with this parameter vector.",
        "The same parameters are later used with the full training data to translate the CoNLL-2013 test set and the blind CoNLL-2014 test set.",
        "As it turns out, averaging parameter vectors across all parts has a consistently positive effect for M 2 .",
        "This is shown in Table 2, systems mentioned in the table are introduced in Section 5 and Section 7.2.",
        "4.4 Tuning Sparse Feature Weights Tuning sparse features (Section 7.2) with M 2 poses an unexpected challenge.",
        "Moses implements two methods for feature-rich tuning: PRO (Hopkins and May, 2011) and Batch k-best MIRA (kb-MIRA) (Cherry and Foster, 2012) that both function as drop-in replacements for MERT.",
        "MERT cannot be used directly with sparse features.",
        "When BLEU is used as a tuning metric, Koehn and Haddow (2012) report results for PRO on a par with MERT for a system with only dense features.",
        "Unfortunately, this cannot be confirmed for M 2 ; we consistently see worse results than for MERT using PRO or kb-MIRA.",
        "PRO and kb-MIRA operate on sentence-level while MERT computes M 2 for the complete corpus.",
        "Similar to Dahlmeier and Ng (2012a), we use sentence-level M 2 as an approximation.",
        "We suspect that M 2 might not be distinctive enough in a 27 14.0 16.0 18.0 20.0 22.0 24.0 26.0 28.0 106 107 108 109 1010 1011 1012 M 2 [ % ] Corpus size (tokens) 4x2-CV CoNLL-2014 ST-2013 CoNLL-2014 Figure 1: Language model corpus size versus M 2 sentence-based scenario.",
        "Koehn and Haddow (2012) also explore a method they call ?PRO-MERT?",
        "where PRO and MERT are run in turns.",
        "The parameter vector calculated by PRO serves as a starting point for MERT which optimizes dense features and in the case of existing sparse features a scalar weight that is multiplied with all sparse feature weights.",
        "While this method does not seem to have any advantage for BLEU-based tuning in a MT setting it has a positive effect on tuning with M 2 .",
        "Results for sparse features are now not worse than when tuned with MERT alone in a dense feature scenario.",
        "Additionally to ?PRO-MERT?, we implemented ?kb-MIRA-MERT?",
        "which seems to display better convergence.",
        "As in the case of dense feature functions, we smooth sparse feature weights by averaging over all eight tuning steps.",
        "All reported results in this paper have been tuned according to M 2 0.5 , systems with dense features use MERT, systems with sparse features kb-MIRA-MERT.",
        "All results are given for parameter vectors that have been smoothed over eight optimizer runs from 4?2-CV.",
        "5 Adding Language Model Data With parameter tuning working, we can now explore the effects of adding feature functions to our system, starting with bigger language models.",
        "All systems use one 5-gram language model that has been estimated from the target side of the parallel data available for training.",
        "In this section, only NUCLE is used as parallel data, four times 3/4 of NUCLE for 4?2-CV and complete NUCLE System 4?2-CV ST-2013 NUCLE 15.43 16.73 +WikiLM 19.18 23.10 +CCLM 10% 21.57 25.71 +CCLM 22.19 27.43 Table 3: Results for increasing language models size on both shared task scenarios for ST-2013.",
        "If additional parallel data is added to the training process (see Section 6), the target data is concatenated with NUCLE and a new 5-gram language model is estimated.",
        "The additional language models discussed in this section form separate feature functions, i.e. they are weighted separately from the target data language model.",
        "We experiment with three models that have been estimated using KenLM's (Heafield, 2011) modified Kneser-Ney estimation tool (Heafield et al., 2013): WikiLM ?",

        "We further investigate the effect of adding even greater parallel resources.",
        "Lang-8 is scraped for additional entries and we manage to nearly double the size of the corpus to 3,733,116 sentences with 51,259,679 tokens on the source side.",

        "We therefore select errors that match NUCLE error types and replace all other errors with their corresponding corrections.",
        "For each pair of sentences, a sequence of deletions and insertions is computed with the LCS algorithm (Maier, 1978) that transform the source sentence into the target sentence.",

        "Although results (Table 6) with error selection increase for 4?2-CV, the NUCLE+CCLM+L8A seems to generalize poorly to new data, there is a significant drop for the external test set.",

        "Inspired by this, we also try a combination (NUCLE+CCLM+L8AT as in Adapted Tuning) of both systems by tuning with the adapted NU-CLE+CCLM+L8A, but applying the weights to the unadapted system NUCLE+CCLM+L8.",
        "This results in a gain of 5% for ST-2013.",
        "It seems that the unadapted Lang8 data introduces a substantial amount of noise that interferes with the tuning process.",

        "We extend translation models with a word-based Levenshtein distance feature (Levenshtein, 1966) that captures the number of edit operations required to turn the source phrase into the target phrase.",
        "Each phrase pair in the phrase table is scored with e d(s,t) where d is the word-based distance function, s is the source phrase, t is the target phrase.",
        "The exponential function is used because Moses relies on a log-linear model.",
        "In the log-linear model, the edit distances of all phrase pairs used to translate a sentence sum to the total number of edits that have been applied to produce the target sentence.",
        "Note that the Lang-8 data has not been processed for noise-reduction, this feature should take care of the problem and penalize sentences that have diverged to much from the source.",

        "For 4?2-CV small improvements can be observed, the effect is more significant for ST-2013.",
        "It can be concluded that this very simple modification of the standard translation model is a beneficial extension of SMT for grammatical correction.",
        "7.2 Sparse Features Sparse features are a relatively new addition to Moses (Hasler et al., 2012).",
        "Unlike dense fea-tures, they are optional and unrestricted in num-ber, thousands of different sparse features may be used.",
        "A verbose version of the above mentioned LD feature is implemented as a sparse feature.",
        "Each edit operation is annotated with the operation type and the words that take part in the operation.",
        "The decoder can now learn to favor or penalize specific edits during tuning.",
        "As before in the case of error adaption patterns from Section 6.2, we generalize substitution operations if common substrings of a length equal to or greater than three characters appear in corresponding source and target phrases.",

        "Each component extends the previous system cumulatively.",
        "we obtain sparse features that look exactly like these patterns.",
        "Features that correspond to patterns that had a frequency below 5 in NUCLE are mapped to del(OTHER), ins(OTHER), and sub(OTHER1,OTHER2).",
        "Contrary to the Levenshtein distance feature, the sparse features are computed during decoding.",
        "Sparse features are added to the system which has already been extended with the dense Levenshtein feature.",
        "Results in Table 8 (+SF) show small, but consistent gains.",
        "LD and SF are linearly dependent as the total sum of triggered sparse features should be equal to the value of LD for a sen-tence, but we still observe positive effects.",
        "Sparse feature tuning is currently a work-around with dubious effects, it can be expected that results might be more significant once this problem is solved.",
