        "This paper highlights the importance of understanding MOOC discussion forum content, and shows that capturing discussion forum content can help uncover students?",
        "intentions and motivation and provide useful information in predicting course completion.",
        "MOOC discussion forums provide a platform for exchange of ideas, course administration and logistics questions, reporting errors in lectures, and discussion about course material.",
        "Unlike classroom settings, where there is face-to-face interaction between the instructor and the students and among the students, MOOC forums are the primary means of interaction in MOOCs.",
        "How-ever, due to the large number of students and the large volume of posts generated by them, MOOC forums are not monitored completely.",
        "Forums can include student posts expressing difficulties in course-work, grading errors, dissatisfaction in the course, which are possible precursors to students dropping out.",
        "Previous work analyzing discussion forum content tried manually labeling posts by categories of interest (Stump et al., 2013).",
        "Unfortunately, the effort involved in manually annotating the large amounts of posts prevents using such solutions on a large scale.",
        "Instead, we suggest using natural language processing tools for identifying relevant aspects of forum content automatically.",
        "Specifi-cally, we explore SeededLDA (Jagarlamudi et al., 2012), a recent extension of topic models which can utilize a lexical seed set to bias the topics according to relevant domain knowledge.",
        "Exploring data from three MOOCs, we find that forum posts usually belong to these three categories?a) course content, which include discussions about course material (COURSE), b) meta-level discussions about the course, including feedback and course logistics (LOGISTICS), and c) other general discussions, which include student introductions, discussions about online courses (GENERAL).",
        "In order to capture these categories automatically we provide seed words for each category.",
        "For example, we extract seed words for the COURSE topic from each course's syllabus.",
        "In addition to the automatic topic assignment, we capture the sentiment polarity using Opinionfinder (Wilson et al., 2005).",
        "We use features derived from topic assignments and sentiment to predict student course completion (student survival).",
        "We measure course completion by examining if the student attempted the final exam/ last few assignments in the course.",
        "We follow the observation that LOGISTICS posts contain feedback about the course.",
        "Finding high-confidence LOGISTICS posts can give a better understanding of student opinion about the course.",
        "Similarly, posting in COURSE topic and receiving good feedback (i.e., votes) is an indicator of student success and might contribute to survival.",
        "We show that modeling these intuitions using topic assignments together with sentiment scores, helps in predicting student survival.",
        "In addition, we examine the topic assignment and sentiment patterns of some users and show that topic assignments help in understanding student concerns better.",
        "28 2 Modeling Student Survival Our work builds on work by Ramesh et al. (2013) and (2014) on modeling student survival using Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL).",
        "The authors included behavioral features, such as lecture views, posting/voting/viewing discussion forum content, linguistic features, such as sentiment and subjectivity of posts, and social interaction features derived from forum interaction.",
        "The authors looked at indication of sentiment without modeling the context in which the sentiment was expressed: positive sentiment implying survival and negative sentiment implying drop-out.",
        "In this work, we tackle this problem by adding topics, enabling reasoning about specific types of posts.",
        "While sentiment of posts can indicate general dissatisfaction, we expect this to be more pronounced in LOGISTICS posts as posts in this category correspond to issues and feedback about the course.",
        "In contrast, sentiment in posts about course material may signal a particular topic of discussion in a course and may not indicate attitude of the student toward the course.",
        "In Section 4.3, we show some examples of course-related posts and their sentiment, and we illustrate that they are not suggestive of student survival.",
        "For example, in Women and the Civil Rights Movement course, the post?",
        "?I think our values are shaped by past generations in our family as well, sometimes negatively.?",
        "?indicates an attitude towards an issue discussed as part of the course.",
        "Hence, identifying posts that fall under LOGISTICS can improve the value of sentiment in posts.",
        "In Section 3, we show how these are translated into rules in our model.",
        "2.1 Probabilistic Soft Logic We briefly overview the some technical details behind Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL).",
        "For brevity, we omit many specifics, and we refer the reader to (Broecheler et al., 2010; Bach et al., 2013) for more details.",
        "PSL is a framework for collec-tive, probabilistic reasoning in relational domains.",
        "Like other statistical relational learning methods (Getoor and Taskar, 2007), PSL uses weighted rules to model dependencies in a domain.",
        "How-ever, one distinguishing aspect is that PSL uses continuous variables to represent truth values, relaxing Boolean truth values to the interval [0,1].",
        "Table 1 lists some PSL rules from our model.",
        "The predicate posts captures the relationship between a post and the user who posted it.",
        "Predicate polarity(P) represents sentiment via its truth value in [0, 1], where 1.0 signifies positive sentiment, and 0.0 signifies negative sentiment.",
        "upvote(P) is 1.0 if the post has positive feedback and 0.0 if the post had negative or no feedback.",
        "U and P refer to user and post respectively.",
        "These features can be combined to produce rules in Table 1.",
        "For exam-ple, the first rule captures the idea that posts with positive sentiment imply student survival.",

        "survival(U) Table 1: Example rules in PSL 3 Enhancing Student Survival Models with Topic Modeling Discussion forums in online courses are organized into threads to facilitate grouping of posts into topics.",
        "For example, a thread titled errata, grading issues is likely a place for discussing course logistics and a thread titled week 1, lecture 1 is likely a place for discussing course content.",
        "But a more precise examination of such threads reveals that these heuristics do not always hold.",
        "We have observed that course content threads often house logistic content and vice-versa.",
        "This demands the necessity of using computational linguistics methods to classify the content in discussion forums.",
        "In this work, we?1) use topic models to map posts to topics in an unsupervised way, and 2) employ background knowledge from the course syllabus and manual inspection of discussion forum posts to seed topic models to get better separated topics.",
        "We use data from three Coursera MOOCs: Surviving Disruptive Technologies, Women and the Civil Rights Movement, and Gene and the Human Condition for our analysis.",

        "Since the syllabus is only an outline of the class, it does not contain all the terms that will be used in class discussions.",
        "To capture other finer course content discussions as separate topics, we include k more topics when we run the SeededLDA.",
        "We notice that not including more topics here, only including the seeded topics (i.e., run SeededLDA with exactly three topics) results in some words from course content discussions, which were not specified in the course-seed words, appearing in the LOGISTICS or GENERAL topics.",
