        "Tools for computer-assisted translation (CAT), including translation memories, term banks, and more, are nowadays standard tools for translators.",
        "The proper use of such tools and resources are also increasingly becoming obligatory parts of translator training.",
        "Yet we believe that translation technology has more to offer translator training, in particular as a support for classroom interaction.",
        "Our proposal includes a quantitative analysis of translations, supported by word alignment technology, to enable joint presenta-tion, discussion, and assessment of individual student translation in class.",
        "For comparisons with related work, see section 4.",
        "From the pedagogical point of view, the suggested procedure embraces at least four types of evaluation: students?",
        "implied self-evaluation, a preliminary computer evaluation, teacher's evaluation after manually correcting the imperfect computer alignment and assessment, and peer evaluation during the collaborative team work in class, when the versions produced by the students are simultaneously displayed, discussed and corrected if necessary.",
        "Theoretically, translations are viewed here as mappings between two languages through emergent conceptual spaces based on an intermediate level of representation (e.g., Honkela et.",
        "al., 2010).",
        "In terms of praxis, the basic approach is rooted in the idea (Vinay & Darbelnet, 1958) of consecutive numbering of the tokens (words) in the original text.",
        "This simple technique enables finding and labeling, in accordance with a chosen set of rules, certain isomorphic correspondences between the source and target tokens.",
        "Finding such correspondences is what current machine translation approaches attempt to achieve by statistical means in the training phase.",
        "The quantitative-qualitative technique we use here is the Token Equivalence Method (TEM) (Tarvi 2004).",
        "The use of the TEM in translation teaching originated as an argument (involving the second author) in a teacher-student debate over the relevance of a grade.",
        "The considerable time spent on the manual preparation of texts for translation using the TEM proved to be fairly well compensated for by the evident objectivity of the grades the argument that, say, only 65% of the original text has been retained in a translation is difficult to brush aside.",
        "Later, the method was applied in research.",
        "Tarvi (2004) compared the classical Russian novel in verse by A. Push-kin Eugene Onegin (1837) with its nineteen English translations.",
        "Figures calculated manually on 10% of the text of the novel showed an excellent fit with the results on the same material obtained elsewhere by conventional comparative methods.",
        "Thus, we believe that characterizations of relations between source and target texts in ob-34 jective terms is a good thing for translation evaluation.",
        "1.1 The TEM: Basics and Example Methodologically, the TEM focuses not on translation ?shifts?",
        "but on what has been kept in translation.",
        "The basic frame for analysis in the TEM is the Token Frame (2.2.1), which accounts for the number of the original tokens retained in translations.",
        "The other four frames (2.2.2-3, 2.3.1-2), although useful in gauging the comparative merits of the translations and the individual strategies, are optional.",
        "To concisely illustrate the method, one sentence will be used ?",
        "the famous 13-token opening sentence of Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina: Vse schastlivye semyi pohozhi drug na druga, kazhdaya neschastlivaya semya neschastliva po svoemu.",
        "(All happy families resemble one an-other, every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.)",
        "Eight English translations of this sentence (2.1) will be used for analysis.",
        "The source text and all its translations are tokenized and analyzed linguistically in different ways.",
        "NLP tools such as lemmatizers, part-of-speech taggers and parsers can be applied.",
        "Most importantly, however, to support the computation of the Token Frames (2.2.1), they must be word-aligned with the source text (2.6).",
        "The teacher or the students are expected to review the alignments and correct them if they are not acceptable.",
        "Given the corrected alignments, the aligned data can be used by the teacher and the students in the classroom.",
        "After this introduction of the basics of the theoretical approach and relevant automatic methods for their implementation, the paper is built around the basic structural foci of any instruction unit: before class (2), in class (3), and outside class (4).",
        "2 Before class This section describes the techniques of processing Source Texts (ST) and Target Texts (TT) by teachers and students.",
        "2.1 Token Numbering and Labeling The procedure starts with consecutive numbering of the original tokens: (1)Vse (2)schastlivye (3)semyi (4)pohozhi (5)drug (6)na (7)druga, (8)kazhdaya (9)neschastlivaya (10)semya (11)neschastliva (12)po (13)svoemu.",
        "The second step is establishing, via the procedure of (corrected) alignment, the correspondences between the Source tokens (St) and Target tokens (Tt).",
        "As a result, every corresponding TT token (Tt), if found, is designated with the number of its source counterpart (St).",
        "Besides, since no Tt may remain unlabeled, two types of Tts which have no counterparts in the ST are labeled as Extra tokens (2.3.1) and Formal tokens (2.3.2).",
        "Here are the eight translations of the example sentence: Leo Wiener: (1899): (1)All (2)happy (3)families (4)resemble (5-6-7)one an-other; (8)every (9)unhappy (10)family (Ft)is (11)unhappy (12)in (Ft)its (13)own way.",
        "Constance Garnett (1901): (2)Happy (3)families (Ft)are (1)all (4)alike; (8)every (9)unhappy (10)family (Ft)is (11)unhappy (12)in (Ft)its (13)own way.",
        "Rochelle S. Townsend (1912): (1)All (2)happy (3)families (Ft)are (Et)more (Et)or (Et)less (4)like (5-6-7)one another; (8)every (9)unhappy (10)family (Ft)is (11)unhappy (12)in (Ft)its (13)own (Et)particular way.",
        "Aylmer & Louise Maude (1918): (1)All (2)happy (3)families (4)resemble (5-6-7)one an-other, (Et)but (8)each (9)unhappy (10)family (Ft)is (11)unhappy (12)in (Ft)its (13)own way.",
        "Rosemary Edmonds (1954): (1)All (2)happy (3)families (Ft)are (4)alike; (Et)but (Ft)an (9)unhappy (10)family (Ft)is (11)unhappy (12)after (Ft)its (13)own fashion.",
        "Joel Carmichael (1960): (2)Happy (3)families (Ft)are (1)all (4)alike; (8)every (9)unhappy (10)family (Ft)is (11)unhappy (12)in (Ft)its (13)own way.",
        "David Magarschack (1961): (1)All (2)happy (3)families (Ft)are (4)like (5-6-7)one another; (8)each (9)unhappy (10)family (Ft)is (11)unhappy (12)in (Ft)its (13)own way.",
        "Richard Pevear & Larisa Volokhonsky (2000): (1)All (2)happy (3)families (Ft)are (4)alike; (8)each (9)unhappy (10)family (Ft)is (11)unhappy (12)in (Ft)its (13)own way.",
        "As is seen, two of the versions are clones (Carmichael, Pevear-Volokhonsky), one translation (Garnett) differs from the original only by the choice of the adjective (St 8), while the remaining five versions are more diverse.",
        "Note the mode of denoting Tts suggested here: only the 35 meaningful denotative tokens get labeled, e.g., are (4)alike, or is (11)unhappy; if not one Tt but a group of tokens is used as an isomorph to a single St, the whole group is underlined, e.g., (13)own way, or (13)own fashion.",
        "Although St 4 has been rendered as are alike (Edmonds, Pevear-Volokhonsky, Garnett, Car-michael), are like (Townsend, Magarschack), and resemble (Wiener, the Maudes), all these rendering are viewed as retaining the denotative meaning of the original token.",
        "Or, for instance, St 12, whether rendered as after (Edmonds) or in (all the rest), is also viewed as retained in translation.",
        "The connotative shades of meaning most suitable for the outlined goals can be discussed in class (3.2).",
        "This mode of displaying the isomorphisms can be converted to the style of representation used in word alignment systems such as Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2003) as follows: Extra tokens and Formal tokens give rise to null links.",
        "Groups of tokens that correspond yield groups of links.",
        "Thus, the analysis for Wiener's translation would come out as below: 1-1 2-2 3-3 4-4 5-5 5-6 6-5 6-6 7-5 7-6 8-7 9-8 10-9 0-10 11-11 12-12 0-13 13-14 13-15.",
        "In gauging the content, two types of basic and optional analytical frames, content and formal, are used.",
        "Based on the way of calculating the results, the analytical frames will be considered here in two sections, percentage frames (2.2) and count frames (2.3).",
        "2.2 The TEM: Percentage Frames The results in these frames are calculated as percentages of the ST information retained in translations.",
        "2.2.1 Basic Content Frame (Token Frame) After finding the isomorphic counterparts, the percentages of the retained tokens are presented in Table 1 (column I).",
        "As one can see, Wiener, the Maudes, Magarschack and Townsend translated all thirteen tokens and, hence, scored 100% each; Garnett, Carmichael and Pevear-Volokhonsky omitted Sts 5-6-7 and thus scored 76%, while Edmonds left out four tokens, Sts 5- 6-7-8, thus retaining 69% of the original.",
        "2.2.2 Optional Formal Frame 1 (Morphology Frame) In this frame, if a token is rendered with the same part of speech as in the original, the Tt in question gets a count.",
        "As can be seen in Table 1 (column II), only two translators, Wiener and the Maudes, kept the same type of predicate 1 (St 4) as in the original ?",
        "resemble ?",
        "while in the remaining six translations the type of predicate 1 has been changed into a compound one: are alike (Edmonds, Pevear-Volokhonsky, Garnett, Carmichael), and are like (Townsend, Magarschack).",
        "Therefore, in this frame, Wiener and the Maudes get a 100% each; Edmonds, with her two changed parts of speech, gets 84%, while the remaining five translators, who changed one part of speech each, score 92%.",
        "2.2.3 Optional Formal Frame 2 (Syntax) Another possible way of gauging the ?presence?",
        "of the original in its translation is monitoring the syntactic changes.",
        "If at least two tokens are rendered in the same sequence as in the original and preserve the same syntactic functions, they are considered syntactically kept.",
        "Non-translated Sts are viewed as non-kept syntactic positions.",
        "Table 1 (column III) shows that Edmonds, who lost four syntactic positions, scores 76%, Garnett, Magarschack and Townsend get 92% each, the rest translators score a 100%.",
        "2.2.4 The Translation Quotient (TQ) As a result of either manual or computer-assisted translation processing, the teacher gets a tabulated picture (Table 1) of the three analyzed frames (columns I, II, III).",
        "In an attempt to combine the obtained figures in a meaningful whole, the Translation Quotient parameter (TQ, column IV) is used: it is the arithmetic mean of the percentages in the monitored frames.",
        "If one adds up the percentage results in all three frames and divides the obtained figure by the number of frames, one gets a TQ, measured in percentage points (pp), which reflects a general quantitative picture of the content-form rendering of the original.",
        "This cumulative parameter has shown a perfect fit with the results obtained by other methods of comparative assessment (Tarvi 2004).",
        "Table 1 shows four groups of TQ results, from 100% (2 versions) through 97% (2) through 86% (3) to 74% (1).",
        "2.3 The TEM: Count Frames To further differentiate the translations in their closeness to the original, pure counts of some quantitative parameters can be added to the picture in Table 1: column V (extra tokens, Ets) and VI (formal Tokens, Fts).",
        "36 2.3.1 Optional Content Frame 1 This frame is a useful tool of assessment, as it shows what has been added to the translation, i.e., the Tts that have no counterparts in the orig-inal, labeled as extra Tokens (Et).",
        "Table 1 (col- umn V) shows that Wiener, Magarschack, Gar-nett, Carmachael, and Pevear-Volokhonsky added no extra Tokens (Ets), the Maudes and Edmonds added by one Et each, while Townsend ?",
        "four.",
        "2.3.2 Optional Formal Frame 3 In this frame, the center of attention is formal Tokens (Fts) ?",
        "articles, tense markers, etc.",
        "Table 1 (column VI) shows that Fts are employed in different quantities: Wiener and the Maudes used two Fts each, Edmonds used four, the rest translators ?",
        "three Fts each.",
        "2.4 TEM Results: the 13-Token Sentence The table below gives a cumulative picture of the results in each of the five frames considered: Table 1.",

        "In the 100% group, Wiener has a slight advantage (in terms of isomorphism) over the Maudes, since he introduced no extra tokens.",
        "In the 97% group, Townsends's translation inferiority (in terms of closeness) is expressed in four extra tokens as compared to no extra tokens in Magarschack's version.",
        "In the 86% block, no distinctions can be made because they are word-for-word clones, except for Pevear-Volokhonsky's use of ?each?",

        "this kind of judgment can arise only after a discussion in classroom (3.3).",
        "The one-sentence example, used here pedagogically to explain the TEM techniques, cannot be considered to be fairly representative of the quantitative parameters and their qualitative implications of translated texts.",
        "Therefore, we offer the results obtained for a much bigger sample from Anna Karenina.",
        "2.4.1 TEM Results: the 405-Token Excerpt Sheldon (1997) performs a detailed conventional comparative analysis of the four ?focal points?",
        "of the novel: the opening sentence considered above (13 tokens), the ball scene (73 tokens), the seduction scene (103 tokens) and the suicide scene (216 tokens).",
        "He analyzed the seven translations considered here, except for the version by Pevear and Volokhonsky, which was published three years later.",
        "Sheldon concluded that it was Carmichael who showed the best fit with the original.",

        "Since the TEM does not cover all aspects of Sheldon's analysis, it favors Magarshack's version, with Carmichael's translation lauded by Sheldon following it closely.",
        "2.5 Language pair independence In our example with translation from Russian to English, there is an asymmetry in that formal tokens are largely to be seen only on the target side.",
        "However, the TEM frames can equally be applied in the reverse direction or to any language pair.",
        "Whether or not we choose to exclude some formal tokens from the counting, the 37 frames are applied in the same way to all translations and their relative differences will be revealed.",
        "2.6 Computational analysis It has been suggested before that virtual learning environments are useful for translation teaching (e.g., Fictumova (2007)).",
        "Our point here is that fine-grained quantitative methods, such as the TEM, can be put to use given support from computational linguistic tools.",
        "The proposed environment consists of a central server and a number of client systems for the students.",
        "Communication between them is handled as in any e-learning environment, where exercises, grades and other course materials can be stored and accessed.",
        "The server includes several modules for monolingual text analysis, such as sentence segmentation, tokenization, lemmatization and PoS-tagging.",
        "A parser may also be included to support the computation of the syntax frame.",
        "More importantly, there are modules for sentence and word alignments, since this is what is required to support the TEM analysis.",
        "In addi-tion, there are modules for reviewing and correcting outputs from all analyzers.",
        "2.6.1 Tokenization In principle, tokenization, numbering and labeling of tokens (2.1), are processes that computers can handle with ease.",
        "It is important, though, that the tokenization is done in a way that supports the purpose to which it will be used.",
        "In this case, a tokenization module that only looks at spaces and separators will not be optimal, as the primary unit of TEM is semantic, and may span several text words.",
        "Moreover, punctuation marks are not treated as separate tokens in the TEM.",
        "This problem could be overcome by tokenizing in two steps.",
        "In the first step punctuation marks are removed, lexical tokens are identified using word lists and then formatted as character strings that have no internal spaces.",
        "In the second stage spaces are used to identify and number the tokens.",
        "Formal tokens can to a large extent be identified as part of this process, using word lists, but extra tokens cannot be identified until after the word alignment.",
        "2.6.2 Sentence alignment In some cases the translation task may require students not to change sentence boundaries and a one-to-one correspondence between source sentences and sentences of the translations can be assumed to hold when translations are delivered.",
        "If not, a sentence alignment tool such as hunalign (Varga et al., 2005) can be used.",
        "2.6.3 Word alignment The accuracy of word alignment systems are quite far from 100%.",
        "The best performing systems are either statistical, such as Giza++ (Och & Ney, 2003), or hybrid (Moore et al., 2006) and require vast amounts of text to perform well.",
        "In the translation class context, the source text will be fairly short, perhaps a few thousand words as a maximum.",
        "Even with, say, 20 student transla-tions, the total bitext, consisting of the source text repeated once for each student translation and sentence-aligned with it, will be too short for a statistical aligner to work well.",
        "For this reason, a hybrid system that relies on a combination of bilingual resources and statistics for the word alignment seems to be the best choice (cf. Ahrenberg & Tarvi, 2013).",
        "An advantage of having a short source text is that the teacher can develop a dictionary for it in advance to be used by the word aligner.",
        "While a teacher cannot predict all possible translations that a student may come up with, this is a resource that can be re-used and extended over several semesters and student groups.",

        "Not all translations suggested by Google have been included.",
        "The mean number of translations per Russian lemma is 1.5.",
        "In the combinations priority has been given to the alignments proposed by the word lists as they are deemed to have a higher precision.2 So, the third row means that Giza++ alignments have been replaced by null links and lexical links induced by the word lists in all cases where there was a contradiction.",
        "The fourth row is the result of applying a set of filters based on word frequencies in the corpus and alignment topology to the previous combination.",
        "Obviously, if a complete alignment is called for it is clear that the output of the system must be reviewed and hand-aligned afterwards.",
        "There are several interactive word-alignment tools that can be used for this purpose (Tiedemann, 2011), but it will still be time-consuming.",
        "However, the burden can be shared between teacher and stu-dents, and efforts may be focused on a part of the text only.",

        "Then the teacher checks the outcome and corrects it if necessary.",
        "The files are then sent to the students.",
        "Within the suggested approach, the students are asked to use the client version of the system for translation and then upload their translations to their teacher by a set date before class, or to bring them to class on memory sticks.",
        "When a student translation is in place in the server system, it can be aligned and graded automatically.",
        "Of course, the significance of the grades depends on the accuracy of the alignment, but both the student and the teacher can contribute to the reviewing.",
        "For instance, the teacher might have marked some words and phrases as especially significant and the student can review the alignments for them in the system for his or her particular translation.",
        "3 In Class When translations and their alignments are in place in the server system, they can be used as 2 The fact that precision is not 100% for wordlist based alignment has two major causes.",
        "First, some content words appear two or three times in a sentence and the system does not manage to pick the right occurrence.",
        "Also, some common English prepositions get aligned when they shouldn't.",

        "Using again the opening sentence of Anna Karenina as our example, the outcome for one sentence can look as in Figure 1, where also some of the token frames described above are automatically computed from the alignment.3 Within this format, the teacher is acting as a post-editing human agent who can combine both manners of assessment ?",
        "computer-assisted and manual.",
        "Since the method combines human and computer resources, it might raise the effectiveness of translation class instruction manifold (Lengyel 2006: 286).",

        "It is at this stage that the qualitative side of the TEM comes into play with the aim of improving the final quantitative grade.",
        "Let us, for instance, consider the way a group of two tokens from the sentence-example has been rendered.",
        "As can be seen here in the manual (Table 5) and computer (Figure 2) versions, this pair of source tokens has been rendered in three different ways.",

        "If, at the end of class, the final grades are exhibited on screen in their ranking order, it might be the best possible motivation for students to work diligently both at home and in class.",

        "Metrics, such as BLEU (Papineni et al.. 2002), TER (Snover et al.. 2006), and Meteor (Lavie and Denkowski: 2009), could also be included in the proposed environment.",
        "Published translations or translations that the teacher recognizes as particularly good can be used as reference translations.",
        "How-ever, the scores of these metrics do not give as much qualitative information as the TEM frames.",
        "The role of corpora in translation and translation training is a topic of some interest (e.g. Zanettin et al.: 2003).",
        "In translator training, the corpora are mostly seen as resources for the student to use when practicing translation (Lopez- 40 Rodriguez and Tercedor-Sanchez: 2008).",
        "This is orthogonal to what we are proposing here, i.e., enabling immediate comparisons and assessments of students?",
        "translations as a class-based activity.",
        "A system with a similar purpose is reported in Shei and Pain (2002: 323) who describe it as an ?intelligent tutoring system designed to help student translators learn to appreciate the distinction between literal and liberal translation?.",
        "Their system allows students to compare their own translations with reference translations and have them classified in terms of categories such as literal, semantic, and communicative.",
        "The comparisons are made one sentence at a time, using the Dice coefficient, i.e., by treating the sentences as bags of words.",
        "Our proposal, in contrast, uses more advanced computational linguistics tools and provides text level assessment based on word alignment.",
        "Michaud and McCoy (2013) describe a system and a study where the goal, as in our pro-posal, is to develop automatic support for translator training.",
        "They focus on the inverted TERp metric (Snover et al., 2009) for evaluation of student translations.",
        "TERp requires a reference translation but can represent the difference between a given translation and the reference in terms of editing operations such as insertion, deletion, change of word order and matches of different kinds.",
        "A weak positive correlation with instructor-based grades (using Pearson's r) could be demonstrated in the study and the authors argue that TERp is sufficiently reliable to provide feed-back to students in a tutoring environment.",
        "The main difference between their proposal and ours is that we start with a metric that has been developed for the task of grading human translations, while TERp is originally an MT metric.",
        "Thus, TEM does not require reference translations, but on the other hand its computation has not been automated and so, that is where our current efforts are focused.",
        "It should be emphasized that the teacher's load within this approach remains quite heavy but the reviewing work may be shared between teachers and students.",
        "Both the TEM and TERp provide quantitative measurements that can lay the foundation for qualitative discussions and feedback to students but as the TEM does not require a reference it gives the students more freedom in improving their work.",
        "As a more or less objective way of measuring the quantity with allowances made for quality, the method can also be used by teachers at ex-ams, by editors for choosing a translation, by managers recruiting new in-house translators, by translators for self-monitoring, etc.",
        "The computer-generated figures are obtained right on the spot ?",
        "they may not be exactly accurate but they give a rough general picture at the level of content-form ?presence?",
