        "Peer review systems are increasingly being used to facilitate the teaching and assessment of student writing.",
        "Peer feedback can complement and even be as useful as teacher feedback; students can also benefit by producing peer feedback.",
        "Past research has shown that feedback implementation is significantly correlated to the presence of desirable feedback features such as the description of solutions to problems (Nelson and Schunn, 2009).",
        "Since it would be very time-consuming for instructors to identify feedback of low quality post-hoc, recent research has used natural language processing (NLP) to automatically predict whether peer feedback contains useful content for guiding student revision (Cho, 2008; Ramachandran and Gehringer, 2011; Xiong et al., 2012).",
        "Such real-time predictions have in turn been used to enhance existing online peer-review systems, e.g. by triggering tutoring that is designed to improve feedback quality (Nguyen et al., June 2014).",
        "While most prior research of peer review quality has focused on feedback regarding papers, similar issues arise when reviewing other types of artifacts such as program code, graphical diagrams, etc.",
        "(Nguyen and Litman, July 2013).",
        "In addi-tion, previous studies have not carefully examined how the level of prediction granularity (e.g. multi-sentential review comments versus sentences) impacts both the accuracy and the educational utility of the predictive models.",
        "For example, while the tutoring intervention of (Nguyen et al., June 2014) highlighted low versus high quality feedback com-ments, such a prediction granularity could not support the highlighting of specific text spans that also might have been instructionally useful.",
        "In this paper, we first address the problem of predicting feedback type (i.e. problem, solution, non-criticism) in peer reviews of student argument diagrams.",
        "In problem feedback, the reviewer describes what is wrong or needs to be improved in the diagram.",
        "In solution feedback, the reviewer provides a way to fix a problem or to improve the diagram quality.",
        "Feedback is non-criticism when it is neither a problem nor a solution (e.g. when it provides only positive feedback or summarizes).",
        "Examples are shown in Figure 1.",
        "1 The second goal of our research is to design our prediction framework so that it can support real-time tutoring about feedback quality.",
        "We hypoth-1 Our peer review corpus comes from a system that uses an end-comment feedback approach as shown in Figure 1.",
        "While it is possible to instead directly annotate a reviewed artifact, this has been shown to encourage feedback on low-level issues, and is not good for more global feedback.",
        "99 #3.",

        "If not, indicate where the argument for relevance or validity is missing or unclear.",

        "Not all of these field are filled out, which makes it hard to get a clear idea of how legit these studies are.",
        "Also, some are unclear.",
        "An example is 24-supports where the reason is a question.",

        "esize that using a student's own high-quality reviews during tutoring, and identifying the explicit text that makes the review high quality, will help students learn how to improve their lower quality reviews.",
        "To facilitate this goal, we develop prediction models that work at the sentence level of granularity.",
        "Figure 1 presents a mock-up of our envisioned peer review interface.",
        "To tutor the student about solutions (figure right), the system uses live examples taken from the student's current review (figure left).",
        "Color is used to display the feedback type predictions: here a non-criticism is displayed in black, while the criticisms that are positive and negative examples of solution are displayed in green and red, respectively.",
        "In addition, to help the student focus on the important aspect of the (green) positive example, the sentence that actually specifies the solution is highlighted in bold.",
        "This paper presents our first results towards realizing this vision.",
        "The contributions of our work are two-fold.",
        "First, we develop a sentence-level model for predicting feedback type in a diagram review corpus.",
        "While our peer review system works at the level of feedback comments (text of each box in Figure 1), we find it is more accurate to annotate and predict at finer-grained granularity levels, then use these predictions to infer the comment's feedback type.",
        "By introducing a small overhead to annotate peer feedback, we created a phrase level-annotated corpus of argument diagram reviews.",
        "Our experimental results show that our learned prediction models using labeled sentences outperform models trained and tested at comment level.",
        "In addition, our models outperform models previously developed for paper rather than diagram feedback, and also show potential generality by avoiding the use of domain-specific features.",
        "Second, we demonstrate that our sentence-level prediction can be used to support visualizations useful for tutoring.",
        "Particular sentences that are predicted to express the com-ment's feedback type are highlighted for instructional purposes (e.g. the bold highlighting in Figure 1).",
        "2 Related work In instructional science, research has been conducted to understand what makes peer feedback helpful.",
        "At the secondary school level, Gielen et al. (2010) found that the presence of justification in feedback significantly improved students?",
        "writing performance.",
        "At the university level, Nelson and Schunn (2009) found that feedback on papers was more likely to be implemented when the feedback contained solutions or pinpointed problem locations.",
        "Lippman et al. (2012) found that similar feedback properties led to greater implementation 100 of feedback on diagrams as well.",
        "Building on such findings, researchers have begun to develop automated methods to identify helpful feedback.",
        "Cho (2008) was the first to take a machine learning approach.",
        "Peer feedback, i.e. comments, were manually segmented into idea units 2 and human-coded for various features including problem detection, solution suggestion, praise, criticism, and summary.",
        "Feedback was then labeled as helpful or not-helpful based on the presence of such features.",
        "The study showed that feedback could be classified regarding helpfulness with up to 67% accuracy using simple NLP techniques including ngrams and part-of-speech.",
        "Our work is different from (Cho, 2008) in that we focus on predicting particular feedback types (i.e. solution and problem) rather than helpfulness in general.",
        "Also, as the raw feedback to peer-review systems is typically at the comment-level, and being aware that idea-units are difficult to automatically segment, we instead predict at the sentence-level to make model deployment more practical.",
        "Our work is more similar to (Xiong and Litman, 2010; Xiong et al., June 2010; Xiong et al., 2012), in which NLP and machine learning were used to automatically predict whether peer reviews of student papers contained specific desirable feedback features.",
        "Xiong and Litman used NLP-based features including paper ngrams, predefined keyword lists, and dependency parses to predict feedback type.",
        "For feedback of type criticism, they also developed models to further predict problem localization and solution.",
        "Following (Cho, 2008), Xiong and Litman evaluated their models on peer review data that had been manually segmented into idea units.",
        "As noted above, the difficulty of automatically segmenting raw comments into idea units makes deployment of such models less practical than our sentence-level approach.",
        "Also like Cho (2008), while their models predicted a label for each idea unit, the relevant text that led to the prediction was not identified.",
        "We will address this limitation by introducing a more fine-grained annotated corpus.",
        "Regarding peer reviews of student argument diagrams rather than papers, Nguyen and Litman (July 2013) developed a rule-based algorithm for predicting feedback that contained localization text (e.g. ?Hypothesis 4?).",
        "Their approach was to 2 Cf. (Cho, 2008) ?a self-contained message on a single piece of strength or weakness found in peer writing.?",
        "first identify common words between a peer comment and its diagram, then classify phrases containing these words into different localization patterns.",
        "Although we similarly focus on diagram rather than paper feedback, our work addresses a different prediction task (namely, predicting feedback type rather than localization).",
        "We also use statistical machine learning rather than a rule-based approach, in conjunction with more general linguistic features, to allow us to ultimately use our models for papers as well as diagrams with minimal modification or training.",
        "Outside of peer review, research has been performed recently to mine wishes and suggestions in product reviews and political discussion.",
        "Goldberg et al. (2009) analyzed the WISH 3 corpus and built wish detectors based on simple word cues and templates.",
        "Focusing on product reviews only, Ramanand et al. (2010) created two corpora of suggestion wishes (wishes for a change in an existing product or service) and purchasing wishes (ex- plicit expressions of a desire to purchase a prod-uct), and developed rules for identifying wish sentences from non-wish ones.",
        "Both (Goldberg et al., 2009; Ramanand et al., 2010) created rules manually by examining the data.",
        "Although we hypothesize that wishes are related to solutions in peer review, our educational data makes direct application of product-motivated rules difficult.",
        "We thus currently use statistical machine learning for our initial research, but plan to explore incorporating expression rules to enhance our model.",
        "Sub-sentence annotation has gained much interest in sentiment analysis and opinion mining.",
        "One notable work is (Wilson et al., 2005) in which the author addressed the problem that the contextual polarity (i.e. positive, negative, or neutral) of the phrase in which a word appears may be different from the word's prior polarity.",
        "We will also use a phrase-level annotation, as described below.",
        "3 Argument diagram review corpus Diagramming software tools such as LASAD (Scheuer et al., 2010) are increasingly being used to teach student argumentation skills through graphical representations.",

        "To further help students create good argument diagrams, it has recently been suggested that receiving and providing feedback on argument diagrams might yield useful pedagogical benefits (Falakmassir et al., July 2013), analogously to improving writing via peer review of papers.",
        "Our corpus consists of a subset of comments from diagram reviews collected from nine separate sections of an undergraduate psychology course.",
        "Student argument diagrams were created using an instructor-defined diagram ontology.",
        "The diagram ontology defines five different types of nodes: Current study, Hypothesis, Theory, Finding, and Study (for reference).",
        "The ontology also defines four different types of arcs that connect nodes: Supports, Opposes, Part-of, and Undecided.",
        "Figure 2 shows part of a student argument diagram that includes two studies, each of which supports a finding which in turn supports or opposes a hypothesis.",
        "In the course that generated our corpus, students first created graphical argument diagrams using LASAD to justify given hypotheses.",
        "Student argument diagrams were then distributed, using the SWoRD (Cho and Schunn, 2007) web-based peer-review system, to other students in the class for reviewing.",
        "Student authors potentially revised their argument diagrams based on peer feedback, then used the diagrams to write the introduction of associated papers.",

        "If no solution idea is found, the comment is labeled Problem if at least one of its idea units presents a problem.",
        "The comment is labeled Combined if it has both solution and problem idea units, or Non-criticism if it does not have solution or problem.",
        "Non-criticism units can be praise, summary or text that does not express any idea, e.g. ?Yes, it is.?",

        "The first author also annotated 244 randomly selected comments, solely to evaluate inter-coder agreement.",
        "The obtained agreement of comment labels was high, with accuracy 0.81 and kappa 0.74.",
        "In addition to comment labeling, the annotator also highlighted 4 text spans that explain the labels.",
        "The marked text span must either express solution or problem information but cannot express both.",
        "Therefore we require the annotator to highlight at the phrase (i.e. sub-sentence) level, and that each marked text must be completely within an idea unit.",
        "Generally speaking this requirement does not increase cognitive workload because annotators already have to read the comment and notice any solution or problem mentioned before label-ing.",

        "The first reason is that the problem or solution text might only be part of a sentence and highlighting only the informative part will give us more valuable data.",
        "Second, sentence segmentation can be performed automatically with high accuracy.",
        "After the corpus was annotated, we ran a sentence segmentation procedure using NLTK 5 to create a labeled corpus at the sentence level as follows.",
        "Each comment is broken into three possible parts: solution including all solution text marked in the comment, problem including all problem text, and other for non-criticism text.",
        "Each part is then segmented into sentences and each sentence is assigned the label of the part to which it belongs.",
        "It may happen that the segmented text is a phrase rather than a complete sentence.",
