        "Abstract",
        "This study provides a method that identifies problematic responses which make automated speech scoring difficult.",
        "When automated scoring is used in the context of a high stakes language proficiency as-sessment, for which the scores are used to make consequential decisions, some test takers may have an incentive to try to game the system in order to artificially inflate their scores.",
        "Since many automated proficiency scoring systems use fluency features such as speaking rate as one of the important features, students may engage in strategies designed to manipulate their speaking rate as measured by the system.",
        "In order to address this issue, we developed a method which filters out non-scorable responses based on text similarity measures.",
        "Given a test response, the method generated a set of features which calculated the topic similarity with the prompt question or the sample responses including relevant content.",
        "Next, an automated filter which identified these problematic responses was implemented using the similarity features.",
        "This filter improved the performance of the baseline filter in identifying responses with topic problems."

        "In spoken language proficiency assessment, some responses may include sub-optimal characteristics which make it difficult for the automated scoring system to provide a valid score.",
        "For instance, some test takers may try to game the system by speaking in their native languages or by citing memorized responses for unrelated topics.",
        "Others may repeat questions or part of questions with modifications instead of generating his/her own response.",
        "Hereafter, we call these problematic responses non-scorable (NS) responses.",
        "By using these strategies, test takers can generate fluent speech, and the automated proficiency scoring system, which utilizes fluency as one of the important factors, may assign a high score.",
        "In order to address this issue, the automated proficiency scoring system in this study used a two-step ap-proach: these problematic responses were filtered out by a ?filtering model,?",
        "and only the remaining responses were scored using the automated scoring model.",
        "By filtering out these responses, the robustness of the automated scoring system can be improved.",
        "The proportion of NS responses, in the assessment of which the responses are scored by human raters, are likely to be low.",
        "For instance, the proportion of NS responses in the international English language assessment used in this study was 2%.",
        "Despite this low proportion, it is a serious problem which has a strong impact on the validity of the test.",
        "In addition, the likelihood of students engaging in gaming strategies may increase with the use of automated scoring.",
        "Therefore, an automated filtering model with a high accuracy is a necessary step to use the automated scoring system as a sole rater.",
        "Both off-topic and copy responses have topic-related problems, although they are at the two extremes in the degree of similarity.",
        "Focusing on the intermediate levels of similarity, Metzler et al. (2005) presented a hierarchy of five similarity lev-els: unrelated, on the general topic, on the specific topic, same facts, and copied.",
        "In the automated scoring of spontaneous speech, responses that fell into unrelated can be considered as off-topic, while the ones that fell into copied can be considered as repetition or plagiarism.",
        "Following this approach, we developed a non-scorable response identification method utilizing similar-116 Figure 1: A diagram of the overall architecture of our method.",
        "ity measures.",
        "We will show that this similarity based method is highly efficient in identifying off-topic or repetition responses.",
        "Furthermore, we will show that the method can effectively detect NS responses that are not directly related to the topicality issue (e.g, non-English responses).",
        "Figure 1 shows the overall architecture of our method including the automated speech proficiency scoring system.",
        "For a given spoken re-sponse, the system performs speech processing including speech recognition and generates a word hypotheses and time stamps.",
        "In addition, the system computes pitch and power; the system calculates descriptive statistics such as the mean and standard deviation of pitch and power at both the word level and response level.",
        "Given the word hypotheses and descriptive features of pitch/power, it derives features for automated proficiency scoring.",
        "In addition, the similarity features are generated based on the word hypotheses and topic models.",
        "Finally, given both sets of features, the filtering model filters out non-scorable responses, and the remainder of the responses are scored using a scoring model.",
        "A detailed description of the system is available from Zechner et al. (2009).",
        "In this study, we will only focus on the filtering model.",
        "This paper will proceed as follows: we first review previous studies in section 2, then describe the data in section 3, and present the method and experiment set-up in sections 4 and 5.",
        "The results and discussion are presented in section 6, and the conclusions are presented in section 7.",
        "2 Related Work Filtering of NS responses for automated speech scoring has been rarely recognized.",
        "Only a few pieces of research have focused on this task, and most studies have targeted highly restricted speech.",
        "van Doremalen et al. (2009) and Lo et al. (2010) used normalized confidence scores of a speech recognizer in recasting speech.",
        "They identified non-scorable responses with promising performances (equal error rates ranged from 10 to 20%).",
        "Cheng and Shen (2011) extended these studies and combined an acoustic model score, a language model score, and a garbage model score with confidence scores.",
        "They applied this new filter to less constrained items (e.g., picture descrip-tion) and identified off-topic responses with an accuracy rate of 90%with a false positive rate of 5%.",
        "Although normalized confidence scores achieved promising performances in restricted speech, they may not be appropriate for the items that elicit unconstrained spontaneous speech.",
        "Low confidence scores signal the use of words or phrases not covered by the language model (LM) and this is strongly associated with off-topic responses in restricted speech in which the target sentence is given.",
        "However, in spontaneous speech, this is not trivial; it may be associated with not only off-topic speech but also mismatch between the LM and speech input due to the low coverage of the LM.",
        "Due to the latter case, the decision based on the confidence score may not be effective in measuring topic similarity.",
        "The topic similarity between two documents has been frequently modeled by relative-frequency measures (Hoad and Zobel, 2003; Shivakumar and Garcia-Molina, 1995), document fingerprinting (Brin et al., 1995; Shivakumar and Garcia-Molina, 1995; Shivakumar and Garcia-Molina, 1996)), and query based information retrieval methods using vector space models or language model (Sander- son, 1997; Hoad and Zobel, 2003).",
        "Document similarity measures have been applied in automated scoring.",
        "Foltz et al. (1999) evaluated the content of written essays using latent semantic analysis (LSA) by comparing the test essays with essays of known quality in regard to their degree of conceptual relevance and the amount of relevant content.",
        "In another approach, the lexical content of an essay was evaluated by comparing the words contained in each essay to the words found in a sample of essays from each score category (Attali and Burstein, 2006).",
        "More recently, Xie et al. (2012) used a similar approach in automated speech scoring; they measured the similarity using three similarity measures, including a lexical matching method (Vector Space Model) and two semantic similarity measures (Latent Semantic Analysis and Pointwise Mutual Informa-tion).",
        "They showed moderately high correlations 117 between the similarity features and human proficiency scores on even the output of an automatic speech recognition system.",
        "Similarity measures have also been used in off-topic detection for non-native speakers?",
        "essays.",
        "Higgins et al. (2006) calculated overlaps between the question and content words from the essay and obtained an error rate of 10%.",
        "Given the promising performance in both automated scoring and off-topic essay detection, we will expand these similarity measures in NS response detection for speech scoring.",
        "3 Data In this study, we used a collection of responses from an international English language assessment.",
        "The assessment was composed of items in which speakers were prompted to provide spontaneous speech.",
        "Approximately 48,000 responses from 8,000 non-native speakers were collected and used for training the automated speech recognizer (ASR set).",
        "Among 24 items in the ASR set, four items were randomly selected.",
        "For these items, a total of 11,560 responses were collected and used for the training and evaluation of filtering model (FM set).",
        "Due to the extremely skewed distribution of NS responses (2% in the ASR set), it was not easy to train and evaluate the filtering model.",
        "In order to address this issue, we modified the distribution of NS responses in the FM set.",
        "Initially, we collected 90,000 responses including 1,560 NS responses.",
        "While maintaining all NS responses, we downsampled the scorable responses in the FM set to include 10,000 responses.",
        "Finally, the proportion of NS responses was 6 times higher in FM set (13%) than ASR set.",
        "This artificial increase of the NS responses reduces the current problem of the skewed NS distribution and may make the task easier.",
        "However, the likelihood of students engaging in gaming strategies may increase with the use of automated scoring, and this increased NS distribution may be close to this situation.",
        "Each response was rated by trained human raters using a 4-point scoring scale, where 1 indicated a low speaking proficiency and 4 indicated a high speaking proficiency.",
        "The raters also labeled responses as NS, when appropriate.",
        "NS responses are defined as responses that cannot be given a score according to the rubrics of the four-point scale.",
        "NS responses were responses with technical difficulties (TDs) that obscured the content of the responses or responses that would receive a score of 0 due to participants?",

        "The speakers, item information, and distribution of proficiency scores are presented in Table 1.",
        "There was no overlap in the sets of speakers in the ASR and FM sets.",
        "In addition, 1,560 NS responses from the FM set were further classified into six types by two raters with backgrounds in linguistics using the rubrics presented in Table 2.",

        "In order to address this issue, we calculated chunk-based similarity features similar to Metzler et al. (2005)'s sentence-based features.",
        "First, the response was split into the chunks which were surrounded by long silences with durations longer than 0.6 sec.",
        "For each chunk, the proportion of word overlap with the question (WOL) was calculated based on the formula (1).",
        "Next, chunks with a WOL higher than 0.5 were considered as question copies.",
        "WOL = |S?Q| |S| where S is a response and Q is a question, |S ?",

        "Among these features, many features were conceptually similar but based on different normalization methods, and they showed a strong inter-correlation.",

        "First, power, pitch and MFCC were extracted at each frame using Praat (Boersma, 2002).",

        "These features captured the overall distribution of energy and voiced regions in a speaker's response.",
        "These features are relevant since NS responses may have an abnormal distribution in energy.",
        "For instance, non-responses contain very low energy.",
        "In order to detect these abnormalities in the speech signal, pitch and power related features were calculated.",
