        "Over the last ten years, work on automatic readability assessment employed sophisticated NLP techniques (such as syntactic parsing and statistical language modeling) to capture highly complex linguistic features, and used statistical machine learning to build readability assessment tools.",
        "A variety of different NLP?based approaches has been proposed so far in the literature, differing at the level of the number of identified readability classes, the typology of features taken into ac-count, the intended audience of the texts under evaluation, or the application within which readability assessment is carried out, etc.",
        "Research focused so far on readability assessment at the document level.",
        "However, as pointed out by Skory and Eskenazi (2010), methods developed perform well when the task is characterizing the readability level of an entire document, while they are unreliable for short texts, including single sentences.",
        "Yet, for specific applications, assessing the readability level of individual sentences would be desirable.",
        "This is the case, for instance, for text simplification: in current approaches, text readability is typically assessed with respect to the entire document, while text simplification is carried out at the sentence level, as e.g. done in Alu?",
        "?sio et al. (2010), Bott and Saggion (2011) and Inui et al. (2003).",
        "By decoupling the readability assessment and simplification processes, the impact of simplification operations on the overall readability level of a given text may not always be clear.",
        "With sentence?based readability assessment, this is expected to be no longer a problem.",
        "Sentence readability assessment thus represents an open issue in the literature which is worth being further explored.",
        "To our knowledge, the only attempts in this direction are represented by Dell?Orletta et al. (2011) and Sj?oholm (2012) for the Italian and Swedish languages respectively, followed more recently by Vajjala and Meurers (2014) dealing with English.",
        "In this paper, we tackle the challenge of assessing the readability of individual sentences as a first step towards text simplification.",
        "The task is modelled as a classification task, with the final aim of shedding light on two open issues connected with it, namely the reference corpora to be used for training (i.e. collections of sentences classified according to their readability level), and the identification of the most effective features to determine sentence readability.",
        "For what concerns the former, sentence readability assessment poses the remarkable issue of classifying sentences according to their difficulty: if all sentences occurring in simplified texts can be assumed to be easy?to?read sentences, the reverse does not necessarily hold since not all sentences occurring in complex texts are to be assumed difficult?to?read.",
        "This fact has important implications at the level of the composition of the corpora to be used for training.",
        "The sec-163 ond issue is concerned with whether and to what extent the features playing a significant role in the assessment of readability at the sentence level coincide with those exploited at the level of document.",
        "In particular, the following research questions are addressed: 1. in assessing sentence readability, is it better to use a small gold standard training corpus of manually classified sentences or a much bigger training corpus automatically constructed from readability?tagged documents possibly containing misclassified sen-tences?",
        "2. which are the features maximizing sentence readability assessment?",
        "3. to what extent do important features for sentence readability classification match those playing a role in the document readability classification?",
        "We will try to answer these questions by working on Italian, which is a less?resourced language as far as readability is concerned.",
        "To this end, READ?IT (Dell?Orletta et al., 2011; Dell?Orletta et al., 2014), which represents the first NLP?based readability assessment tool for Italian, was specialized in different respects, namely at the level of the training corpus and of the learning algorithm; to investigate questions 2. and 3. above, a maximum entropy?based feature selection and ranking algorithm (i.e. grafting) was selected.",
        "The specific target audience of readers addressed in this study is represented by people characterised by low literacy skills and/or by mild cognitive impairment.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the background literature, Section 3 introduces our approach to the task, in terms of used corpora, features and learning algorithm.",
        "Finally, Sections 4 and 5 describe the experimental setting and discuss achieved results.",
        "2 Background In spite of the acknowledged need of performing readability assessment at the sentence level, so far very few attempts have been made to systematically investigate the issues and challenges concerned with the readability assessment of sentences (as opposed to documents).",
        "The first two studies in this direction focused on languages other than English, namely Italian (Dell?Orletta et al., 2011) and Swedish (Sj?oholm, 2012).",
        "In both cases, the authors start from the assumption that while all sentences occurring in simplified texts can be assumed to be easy?to?read sen-tences, the reverse is not true, since not all sentences occurring in complex texts are difficult?to?",
        "read.",
        "This has important consequences at the level of the evaluation of sentence classification results: i.e. erroneous readability assessments within the class of difficult?to?read texts may either correspond to those easy?to?read sentences occurring within complex texts or represent real classification errors.",
        "To overcome this problem in the readability assessment of individual sentences, a notion of distance with respect to easy-to-read sentences was introduced by Dell?Orletta et al. (2011).",
        "Focusing on English, a similar issue is addressed more recently by Vajjala and Meurers (2014) who developed a binary sentence classifier trained on Wikipedia and Simple English Wikipedia: they showed that the low accuracy obtained by their classifier stems from the incorrect assumption that all Wikipedia sentences are more complex than the Simple Wikipedia ones.",
        "Besides readability, sentence?based analyses are reported in the literature for related tasks: for instance, in a text simplification scenario by Drn-darevi?c et al. (2013), Alu?",
        "?sio et al. (2008), ?",
        "Stajner and Saggion (2013) and Barlacchi and Tonelli (2013); or to predict writing quality level by Louis and Nenkova (2013).",
        "Sheikha and Inkpen (2012) report the results of both document?",
        "and sentence?",
        "based classification in the different but related task of assessing formal vs. informal style of a docu-ment/sentence.",
        "For students learning English, Andersen et al. (2013) made a self?assessment and tutoring system available which was able to assign a quality score for each individual sentence they write: this provides automated feedback on learn-ers?",
        "writing.",
        "A further important issue, largely investigated in previous readability assessment studies, is the identification of linguistic factors playing a role in assessing the readability of documents.",
        "If traditional readability metrics (see e.g., Kincaid et al. (1975)) typically rely on raw text characteris-tics, such as word and sentence length, the new NLP?based readability indices exploit wider sets of features ranging across different linguistic levels.",
        "Starting from Schwarm and Ostendorf (2005) and Heilman et al. (2007), the role of syntactic 164 features in this task was considered, and more re-cently, the role of discourse features (e.g., discourse topic, discourse cohesion and coherence) has also been taken into account (see e.g., Barzi-lay and Lapata (2008), Pitler and Nenkova (2008), Kate et al. (2010), Feng et al. (2010) and Tonelli et al. (2012)).",
        "Many of these studies also explored the usefulness of features belonging to individual levels of linguistic description in predicting text readability.",
        "For example, Feng et al. (2010) systematically evaluated a wide range of features and compared the results of different statistical classifiers trained on different classes of features.",
        "Sim-ilarly, the correlation between level?specific features has been calculated by Pitler and Nenkova (2008) with respect to human readability judg-ments, and by Franc?ois and Fairon (2012) with respect to readability levels.",
        "In both cases, the classes of features which turned out to be highly correlated with readability judgments were used in a readability assessment tool to test their efficacy.",
        "Note, however, that in all cases the predictive power of the selected features was evaluated at the document level only.",
        "3 Our Approach In this section, we introduce the main ingredients of our approach to sentence readability as-sessment, corpora used for training and testing, selected features and the learning and feature selection algorithm.",
        "3.1 Corpora We relied on two different corpora: a newspaper corpus, La Repubblica (henceforth, Rep), and an easy?to?read newspaper, Due Parole (henceforth, 2Par).",
        "2Par includes articles specifically written by Italian linguists experts in text simplification for an audience of adults with a rudimentary literacy level or with mild intellectual disabilities (Piemontese, 1996), which represents the target audience of this study.",
        "The two corpora ?",
        "selected as representative of complex vs. simplified texts within the journalistic genre ?",
        "differ significantly with respect to the distribution of features typically correlated with text complexity (Dell?Orletta et al., 2011) and thus represent reliable training datasets.",
        "However, whereas such a distinction is valid as far as documents are concerned, it appears to be a simplistic generalization when the focus is on sentences.",
        "In other words, whereas we can consider all sentences of 2Par as easy?to?read, not all Rep sentences are expected to be difficult?to?read.",
        "From this it follows that whereas the internal composition of 2Par is homogeneous at the sentence level, this is not the case for Rep. To overcome this asymmetry and in particular to assess the impact of the noise in the Rep training corpus, we constructed different training sets differing in size and internal composition, going from a noisy set which assumes all Rep sentences to be difficult?to?read to a clean but smaller set in which the easy?to?read sentences occurring in Rep were manually filtered out.",
        "These training sets were used in different experiments whose results are reported in Section 4.2.",
        "The corpus containing only difficult?to?read sentences was manually built by annotating Rep sentences according to their readability (i.e. easy vs. difficult).",
        "The annotation process was carried out by two annotators with a background in computational linguistics.",
        "In order to assess the reliability of their judgements, we started with a small annotation experiment: the two annotators were provided with the same 5 articles from the Rep corpus (for a total of 107 sentences) and were asked to extract the difficult?to?read sentences (as opposed to both easy?to?read and not?easy?to?",
        "classify sentences).",
        "The first annotator carried out the task in 5 minutes and 46 seconds, while the second annotator took 9 minutes and 8 seconds.",
        "The two annotators agreed on the classification of 81 difficult?to?read sentences out of 107 considered ones (in particular, the first annotator identified 90 difficult?to?read?sentences and the second one 93 sentences).",
        "The agreement between the two annotators was calculated in terms of pre-cision, by taking one of the annotation sets as the gold standard and the other as response: on aver-age, we obtained a precision of 0.88 in the retrieval of sentences definitely classified as difficult?to?",
        "read.",
        "Given the high level of agreement, the two annotators were asked to select difficult sentences from two sets of distinct Rep articles.",
        "This resulted in a set of 1,745 difficult?to?read sentences which were used together with a random selection of easy?to?read sentences from 2Par for training and testing.",

        "2 2 For an exhaustive discussion including the motivations underlying this selection of features, the interested reader is Raw text features (Features [1?2] in Table 1) refer to those features typically used within traditional readability metrics and include sentence length, calculated as the average number of words per sentence, and word length, calculated as the average number of characters per words.",
        "The cover category of lexical features (Features [3?8] in Table 1) includes features referring to referred to Dell?Orletta et al. (2011, 2014) where these features were successfully used for assessing the readability of Italian texts.",
        "166 both the internal composition of the vocabulary and the lexical richness of the text.",
        "For what concerns the former, the Basic Italian Vocabulary by De Mauro (2000) was taken as a reference re-source, including a list of 7000 words highly familiar to native speakers of Italian.",
        "In particular, we consider: a) the percentage of all unique words (types) on this reference list occurring in the text, and b) the internal distribution of the occurring basic Italian vocabulary words into the usage classification classes of ?fundamental words?",
        "(very frequent words), ?high usage words?",
        "(frequent words) and ?high availability words?",
        "(relatively lower frequency words referring to everyday life).",
        "Lexical richness of texts is monitored by computing the Type/Token Ratio (TTR), which refers to the ratio between the number of lexical types and the number of tokens within a text.",
        "Due to its sensitivity to sample size, this feature is computed for text samples of equivalent length.",
        "The set of morpho?syntactic features (Features [9?41] in Table 1) is aimed at capturing different aspects of the linguistic structure affecting in one way or another the readability of a text.",
        "They range from the probability distribution of part?",
        "of?speech (POS) types, to the lexical density of the text, calculated as the ratio of content words (verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs) to the total number of lexical tokens in a text.",
        "This class also includes features referring to the distribution of verbs by mood and/or tense, which can be seen as a language?specific feature exploiting the predictive power of the Italian rich morphology.",
        "The set of syntactic features (Features [42?87] in Table 1) captures different aspects of the syntactic structure which are taken as reliable indicators for automatic readability assessment, namely: ?",
        "the unconditional probability of syntactic dependency types, e.g. subject, direct object, modifier, etc.",
        "(Features 42?70); ?",
        "parse tree depth features (71?72), going from the depth of the whole parse tree, calculated in terms of the longest path from the root of the dependency tree to some leaf, to a more specific feature referring to the average depth of embedded complement ?chains?",
        "governed by a nominal head and including either prepositional complements or nominal and adjectival modifiers; ?",
        "verbal predicate features (73?78) aimed at capturing different aspects of the behaviour of verbal predicates: they range from the number of verbal roots with respect to number of all sentence roots occurring in a text, to more specific features such as the arity of verbs, meant as the number of instantiated dependency links sharing the same verbal head (covering both arguments and modi-fiers) and the relative ordering of subject and object with respect to the verbal head; ?",
        "as subordination is widely acknowledged to be an index of structural complexity in language, subordination features (79?",
        "85) include: the distribution of subordinate vs. main clauses; for subordinates, the distribution of infinitives vs finite complement clauses, their relative ordering with respect to the main clause and the average depth of ?chains?",
        "of embedded subordinate clauses; ?",
        "the length of dependency links is another characteristic connected with the syntactic complexity of sentences.",
        "Features 86?87 measure dependency length in terms of the words occurring between the syntactic head and the dependent: they focus on all dependency links vs. maximum dependency links only.",
        "3.3 Model Training and Feature Ranking Given the twofold goal of this study, i.e. reliably assessing sentence readability and finding the most predictive features undelying it, we used GRAFTING (Perkins et al., 2003), as this approach allows to train a maximum entropy model while simultaneously including incremental feature selection.",
        "The method uses a gradient?based heuristic to select the most promising feature (to add to the set of selected features S), and then performs a full weight optimization over all features in S. This process is repeated until a certain stopping criterion is reached.",
        "As the grafting approach we use integrates the l 1 regularization (preventing overfit-ting), features are only included (i.e. have a non-zero weight) when the reduction of the objective function is greater than a certain treshold.",
        "In our case, the l 1 prior we use was selected on the basis of evaluating maximum entropy models with varying l 1 values (range: 1e-11, 1e-10, ..., 0.1, 1) via 10?fold cross validation.",
        "We used TINYEST 3 , a 3 http://github.com/danieldk/tinyest 167 grafting-capable maximum entropy parameter estimator for ranking tasks (de Kok, 2011; de Kok, 2013), to select the features and estimate their weights.",
        "Whereas our task is not a ranking task, but rather a binary classification problem, we were able to model it as a ranking task by assigning a high score (1) to difficult?to?read sentences and a low score (0) to easy?to?read sentences.",
        "Conse-quently, a sentence having a score < 0.5 was interpreted as an easy?to?read sentence, whereas a sentence which was assigned a score ?",
        "0.5 was interpreted to be a difficult?to?read sentence.",
        "4 Experiments and Results 4.1 Experimental Setup In all experiments, the corpora were automatically tagged by the part?of?speech tagger described in Dell?Orletta (2009) and dependency?parsed by the DeSR parser (Attardi, 2006) using Support Vector Machines as learning algorithm.",
        "We devised two different experiments, aimed at exploring the research questions investigated in this paper.",
        "To this end, READ?IT was adapted by integrating a specialized training corpus and a maximum entropy?based feature selection and ranking algorithm (i.e. grafting).",
        "Experiment 1 This experiment, investigating the first research question, is aimed at identifying what is the most effective training data for sentence readability assessment.",
        "In particular, the goal is to compare the results on the basis of using a small set of gold standard data with respect to a (potentially larger, but) noisy data set (i.e. without manual re-vision) where every Rep sentence was assumed to be difficult?to?read.",
        "In particular, the comparison involved four datasets: ?",
        "a collection of gold standard data consisting of 1,310 easy?to?read sentences randomly extracted from the 2Par corpus and 1,310 manually selected difficult?to-read sentences from the Rep corpus; ?",
        "a large and unbalanced collection of uncorrected data consisting of the whole 2Par corpus (3,910 easy?to?read sentences) and the whole Rep corpus (8,452 sentences, classified a priori as difficult?to?read); ?",
        "a balanced collection of uncorrected sen-tences, consisting of 3,910 sentences from 2Par and 3,910 sentences from Rep; ?",
        "a balanced collection of uncorrected sentences having the same size as the gold standard dataset, namely 1,310 sentences from 2Par and 1,310 sentences from Rep. To assess similarities and differences at the level of the different corpora used for training in this experiment, in Table 2 we report a selection of linguistic features (see Section 3.2) characterizing the four datasets with respect to the whole 2Par corpus.We can observe that 2Par differs from all four Rep corpora for all reported features, and that the four Rep corpora show similar trends.",
        "Inter-estingly, however, the Rep Gold corpus is almost always the most distant one from 2Par (i.e. at the level of sentence length, word length, distribution of adjectives and subjects, average length of dependency links and parse tree depth).",
        "On the basis of the four Rep datasets, four models were built which we evaluated using a held?",
        "out test set consisting of 435 sentences from 2Par and 435 manually classified difficult?to?read sentences from Rep.",
        "Using the grafting method, we calculated the classification score for each sentence in our test set on the basis of an increasing number of features (ranging from 1 to all non-zero weighted features for the specific dataset): sentences with a score below 0.5 were classified as easy?to?read, whereas sentences having a score greater or equal to 0.5 were classified as difficult?",

        "From this it follows that treating the whole Rep corpus as a collection of difficult?to?read sentences is not completely unjustified: this is in line with the satisfactory results reported by Dell?Orletta et al. (2011) where Rep was used for training a sentence read-169 ability classifier without any manual filtering of sentences.",

        "Sentence readability classification thus seems to be a more complex task, requiring a higher amount of features.",
        "This trend emerges more clearly in Figures 1(a) and 1(b), where the classification results on the training set (using 10?fold cross?validation) and the held?out test set are visualized for increasing amounts of features selected via GRAFTING.",
        "As Figure 1(a) shows, the document classification task requires about 14 features after which the performance appears to stabilize (97.4% accuracy for the ten?fold cross-validation and 96.7% for the held?out test set).",
        "In contrast, Figure 1(b) shows that sentence classification requires at least 30 features (83.4% accuracy for the ten?fold cross-validation and 79.9% for the test set).",

        "The feature Subordinate clauses in pre?verbal position [81], focusing on the global distribution of pre?verbal subordinate clauses within the document, is relevant for document classification only.",
        "It is interesting to note that features capturing different facets of the same phenomenon can play quite a different role for assessing the readability of sentences vs. documents: this is the case of dependency length, measured in terms of the words occurring between the syntactic head and the dependent, where feature [86] refers to the average length of all dependency links and [87] to the average length of 170 (a) Document classification (b) Sentence classification Figure 1: Document vs Sentence classification results maximum dependency links from each sentence.",
        "Whereas [86] plays a similar role for sentences and documents (in both cases it is a middle rank feature), [87] is a global feature playing a more prominent role in document classification.",
        "At the morpho?syntactic level, the feature ranking is more comparable.",
        "However, it is interesting to note that very few morpho?syntactic features were selected by the feature selection pro-cess: this is particularly true for document classification.",
        "This can follow from the fact that these features can be considered as proxies of the syntactic structure which in these experiments was represented through specific features: in this situ-ation, the grafting process preferred syntactic features over morpho?syntactic ones, in spite of the lower accuracy of the dependency parser with respect to the part?of?speech tagger.",
        "Interestingly, this result is in contrast with what reported by Falkenjack and J?onsson (2014) for what concerns document readability assessment, who claim that an optimal subset of text features for readability based document classification does not need features induced via parsing.",
        "Among the morpho?",
        "syntactic features, it appears that verbal features play an important role: this can follow both by the language dealt with which is a a morphologically rich language, and by the fact that these features do not have a counterpart at the syntactic level.",
        "Lexical features show a much more mixed result.",
        "Type?Token Ratio (TTR) is only important for document classification, whereas most of the other features are important for sentence readabil-ity, but not for document readability (with the exception of the presence of ?fundamental words?",
        "of the Basic Italian Vocabulary).",
        "5 Discussion In this study we have focused on three research questions.",
        "First, we asked which type of training corpus is best to assess sentence readability.",
        "Whereas we found that using a set of manually selected complex sentences was better than using a simple corpus?based distinction, the extra effort needed to construct the training corpus might not be worthwhile as observed improvements were quite modest.",
        "However, we did not consider a more sensitive measure of the difficulty of a sentence (such as a number ranging between 0 and 1), and this might be able to offer a more substantial improvement (at the cost of needing more time to create the training material).",
        "Of course, when the goal is to identify the best features for assessing sentence readability, it does make sense to have high?quality training data to prevent selecting inadequate features.",
        "The second research question involved identifying which features were most useful for assessing sentence readability.",
        "Besides raw text features, syntactic but also morpho?",
        "syntactic features turned out to play a central role to achieve adequate performance.",
        "The third research question investigated the overlap between the features needed for document and sentence readability classification.",
        "Whereas there certainly was overlap between the top features (with different levels of performance), most of the features had a different rank across the two tasks, with local features being more predictive for sentence classification and global ones for documents.",
        "This suggests that the sentence readability task is more complex than assessing document readabil-ity, given that there is much less information available for a sentence than for a document.",
