        "The movements of such speakers are limited by their athetoid symptoms, and their consonants are often unstable or unclear, which makes it difficult for them to communicate.",
        "In this paper, exemplar-based spectral conversion using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is applied to a voice with an articulation disorder.",
        "In order to preserve the speaker's individuality, we use a combined dictionary that was constructed from the source speaker's vowels and target speaker's consonants.",
        "However, this exemplar-based approach needs to hold all the training exemplars (frames), and it may cause mismatching of phonemes between input signals and selected exemplars.",
        "In this paper, in order to reduce the mismatching of phoneme align-ment, we propose a phoneme-categorized sub-dictionary and a dictionary selection method using NMF.",

        "In this study, we focused on a person with an articulation disorder resulting from the athetoid type of cerebral palsy.",
        "About two babies in 1,000 are born with cerebral palsy (Hollegaard et al., 2013).",
        "Cerebral palsy results from damage to the central nervous system, and the damage causes movement disorders.",
        "Cerebral palsy is classified into the following types: 1)spastic, 2)athetoid, 3)ataxic, 4)atonic, 5)rigid, and a mixture of these types (Canale and Campbell, 2002).",
        "Athetoid symptoms develop in about 10-15% of cerebral palsy sufferers (Hollegaard et al., 2013).",
        "In the case of a person with this type of articulation disorder, his/her movements are sometimes more unstable than usual.",
        "That means their utterances (especially their consonants) are often unstable or unclear due to the athetoid symptoms.",
        "Athetoid symptoms also restrict the movement of their arms and legs.",
        "Most people suffering from athetoid cerebral palsy cannot communicate by sign language or writing, so there is great need for voice systems for them.",
        "In this paper, we propose a voice conversion (VC) method for articulation disorders.",
        "Regarding speech recognition for articulation disorders, the recognition rate using a speaker-independent model which is trained by well-ordered speech, is 3.5% (Matsumasa et al., 2009).",
        "This result implies that the utterance of a person with an articulation disorder is difficult to understand for people who have not communicated with them before.",
        "In recent years, people with an articulation disorder may use slideshows and a previously synthesized voice when they give a lecture.",
        "How-ever, because their movement is restricted by their athetoid symptoms, to make slides or synthesize their voice in advance is hard for them.",
        "People with articulation disorders desire a VC system that converts their voice into a clear voice that preserves their voice's individuality.",
        "Rudzicz et al. (Rudzicz, 2011; Rudzicz, 2014) proposed speech adjustment method for people with articulation disorders based on the observations from the database.",
        "In (Aihara et al., 2014), we proposed individuality-preserving VC for articulation disorders.",
        "In our VC, source exemplars and target exemplars are extracted from the parallel29 training data, having the same texts uttered by the source and target speakers.",
        "The input source signal is expressed with a sparse representation of the source exemplars using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).",
        "By replacing a source speaker's exemplar with a target speaker's exemplar, the original speech spectrum is replaced with the target speaker's spectrum.",
        "People with articulation disorders wish to communicate by their own voice if they can; therefore, we proposed a combined-dictionary, which consists of a source speaker's vowels and target speaker's well-ordered consonants.",
        "In the voice of a person with an articulation disorder, their consonants are often unstable and that makes their voices unclear.",
        "Their vowels are relatively stable compared to their consonants.",
        "Hence, by replacing the articulation-disordered basis of consonants only, a voice with an articulation disorder is converted into a non-disordered voice that preserves the individuality of the speaker's voice.",
        "In this paper, we propose advanced individuality-preserving VC using NMF.",
        "In order to avoid a mixture of the source and target spectra in a converted phoneme, we applied a phoneme-categorized dictionary and a dictionary selection method to our VC using NMF.",
        "In conventional NMF-based VC, the number of dictionary frames becomes large because the dictionary holds all the training exemplar frames.",
        "Therefore, it may cause phoneme mismatching between input signals and selected exemplars and some frames of converted spectra might be mixed with the source and target spectra.",
        "In this paper, a training exemplar is divided into a phoneme-categorized sub-dictionary, and an input signal is converted by using the selected sub-dictionary.",
        "The effectiveness of this method was confirmed by comparing it with a conventional NMF-based method and a conventional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based method.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, related works are introduced.",
        "In Section 3, the basic idea of NMF-based VC is described.",
        "In Section 4, our proposed method is described.",
        "In Section 5, the experimental data are evaluated, and the final section is devoted to our conclusions.",
        "2 Related Works Voice conversion (VC) is a technique for converting specific information in speech while maintaining the other information in the utterance.",
        "One of the most popular VC applications is speaker conversion (Stylianou et al., 1998).",
        "In speaker con-version, a source speaker's voice individuality is changed to a specified target speaker's so that the input utterance sounds as though a specified target speaker had spoken it.",
        "There have also been studies on several tasks that make use of VC.",
        "Emotion conversion is a technique for changing emotional information in input speech while maintaining linguistic information and speaker individuality (Veaux and Robet, 2011).",
        "In recent years, VC has been used for automatic speech recognition (ASR) or speaker adaptation in text-to-speech (TTS) systems (Kain and Macon, 1998).",
        "These studies show the varied uses of VC.",
        "Many statistical approaches to VC have been studied (Valbret et al., 1992).",
        "Among these ap-proaches, the Gaussian mixture model (GMM)- based mapping approach (Stylianou et al., 1998) is widely used.",
        "In this approach, the conversion function is interpreted as the expectation value of the target spectral envelope.",
        "The conversion parameters are evaluated using Minimum Mean-Square Error (MMSE) on a parallel training set.",
        "A number of improvements in this approach have been proposed.",
        "Toda et al. (Toda et al., 2007) introduced dynamic features and the global variance (GV) of the converted spectra over a time sequence.",
        "Helander et al. (Helander et al., 2010) proposed transforms based on partial least squares (PLS) in order to prevent the over-fitting problem associated with standard multivariate regression.",
        "There have also been approaches that do not require parallel data that make use of GMM adaptation techniques (Lee andWu, 2006) or eigen-voice GMM (EV-GMM) (Toda et al., 2006).",
        "In the field of assistive technology, Nakamura et al. (Nakamura et al., 2012; Nakamura et al., 2006) proposed GMM-based VC systems that reconstruct a speaker's individuality in electrolaryn-geal speech and speech recorded by NAM microphones.",
        "These systems are effective for electrola-ryngeal speech and speech recorded by NAM microphones however, because these statistical approaches are mainly proposed for speaker con-version, the target speaker's individuality will be30 changed to the source speaker's individuality.",
        "People with articulation disorders wish to communicate by their own voice if they can and there is a needs for individuality-preserving VC.",
        "Text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) is a famous voice application that is widely researched.",
        "Veaux et al. (Veaux et al., 2012) used HMM-based speech synthesis to reconstruct the voice of individuals with degenerative speech disorders resulting from Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).",
        "Yamagishi et al. (Yamagishi et al., 2013) proposed a project named ?Voice Banking and Reconstruc-tion?.",
        "In that project, various types of voices are collected and they proposed TTS for ALS using that database.",
        "The difference between TTS and VC is that TTS needs text input to synthesize speech, whereas VC does not need text input.",
        "In the case of people with articulation disorders resulting from athetoid cerebral palsy, it is difficult for them to input text because of their athetoid symptoms.",
        "Our proposed NMF-based VC (Takashima et al., 2012) is an exemplar-based method using sparse representation, which is different from the conventional statistical method.",
        "In recent years, approaches based on sparse representations have gained interest in a broad range of signal processing.",
        "In approaches based on sparse representa-tions, the observed signal is represented by a linear combination of a small number of bases.",
        "In some approaches for source separation, the atoms are grouped for each source, and the mixed signals are expressed with a sparse representation of these atoms.",
        "By using only the weights of the atoms related to the target signal, the target signal can be reconstructed.",
        "Gemmeke et al. (Gem- meke et al., 2011) also propose an exemplar-based method for noise-robust speech recognition.",
        "In that method, the observed speech is decomposed into the speech atoms, noise atoms, and their weights.",
        "Then the weights of the speech atoms are used as phonetic scores (instead of the likelihoods of hidden Markov models) for speech recognition.",
        "In (Takashima et al., 2012), we proposed noise-robust VC using NMF.",
        "The noise exemplars, which are extracted from the before- and after-utterance sections in an observed signal, are used as the noise-dictionary, and the VC process is combined with an NMF-based noise-reduction method.",
        "On the other hand, NMF is one of the clustering methods.",
        "In our exemplar-based VC, if the phoneme label of the source exemplar is given, we can discriminate the phoneme of the input signal by using NMF.",
        "In this paper, we proposed a dictionary selection method using this property of NMF.",

        "These two dictionaries consist of the same words and are aligned with dynamic time warping (DTW) just as conventional GMM-based VC is.",
        "Hence, these dictionaries have the same number of bases.",
        "This method assumes that when the source signal and the target signal (which are the same words but spoken by different speakers) are expressed with sparse representations of the source dictionary and the target dictionary, respectively, the ob-31 tained activity matrices are approximately equivalent.",

        "For this reason, we assume that when there are parallel dictionaries, the activity of the source features estimated with the source dictionary may be able to be substituted with that of the target features.",
