        "Whether about coffee preparation, music taste, or legal cases in courtrooms, arguing has always been the dominant way of rationalizing opinions.",
        "An argument consists of one or more premises leading to exactly one conclusion, while argumentation connects together several arguments (Van Eemeren et al., 2013).",
        "Across domains, argumentation differs in vocabulary, style, and purpose, ranging from legal (Walton, 2005) and scientific argumentation (Jim?enez-Aleixandre and Erduran, 2007) to media (Walton, 2007) and social argumentation (Shum, 2008).",
        "When argumentation involves interactive argument exchange with elements of persuasion, we talk about debating.",
        "In the increasingly popular online debates, such as VBATES, 1 users can en-1 http://vbate.idebate.org/ gage in debates over controversial topics, introduce new arguments or use existing ones.",
        "Early computational approaches to argumentation have developed in two branches: logic-based approaches (Bos and Gabsdil, 2000; Lauriar et al., 2001) and argumentative zoning (Teufel and others, 2000).",
        "The latter aims to recognize argumentative sections of specific purpose in scientific papers, such as goals, related work, or conclusion.",
        "Moens et al. (2007) introduced argumentation mining as a research area involved with the automatic extraction of argumentation structure from free text, residing between NLP, argumentation theory, and information retrieval.",
        "Prior work in argumentation mining has focused on official documents, such as legal cases (Palau and Moens, 2009), or moderated sources, such as debates (Cabrio and Villata, 2012).",
        "However, by far the largest source of opinions are online user discussions: comments on newspaper articles, social networks, blogs, and discussion forums ?",
        "all argumentation arenas without strict rules.",
        "Despite the fact that the user-generated content is not moderated nor structured, one can often find an abundance of opinions, most of them backed up with arguments.",
        "By analyzing such arguments, we can gain valuable insight into the reasons underpinning users?",
        "opinions.",
        "Understanding the reasons has obvious benefits in social opinion mining, with applications ranging from brand analysis to political opinion mining.",
        "Inspired by this idea, in this paper we take on the task of argument-based opinion mining.",
        "Instead of merely determining the general opinion or stance of users towards a given topic, in argument-based opinion mining we wish to determine the arguments on which the users base their stance.",
        "Unlike in argumentation mining, we are not ultimately interested in recovering the argumentation structure.",
        "Instead, we wish to recognize what arguments the user has used to back up her opinion.",
        "49 As an example, consider a discussion on the topic ?Should gay marriage be legal??",
        "and the following comment: Gay marriages must be legal in all 50 states.",
        "A marriage is covenant between 2 people regardless of their genders.",
        "Discrimination against gay marriage is unconstitutional and biased.",
        "Tolerance, education and social justice make our world a better place.",
        "This comment supports the argument ?It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry?",
        "and denies the argument ?Marriage should be between a man and a woman?.",
        "The technical challenge here lies in the fact that, unlike in debates or other more formal argumentation sources, the arguments provided by the users, if any, are less formal, ambiguous, vague, implicit, or often simply poorly worded.",
        "In this paper, we make a first step towards argument-based opinion mining from online discussions and introduce the task of argument recognition.",
        "We define this task as identifying what arguments, from a predefined set of arguments, have been used in users?",
        "comments, and how.",
        "We assume that a topic-dependent set of arguments has been prepared in advance.",
        "Each argument is described with a single phrase or a sentence.",
        "To back up her stance, the user will typically use one or more of the predefined arguments, but in their own wording and with varying degree of explicitness.",
        "The task of argument recognition amounts to matching these arguments to the predefined argu-ments, which can be either attacked or supported by the comment.",
        "Note that the user's comment may by itself be a single argument.",
        "However, we refer to it as comment to emphasize the fact that in general it may contain several arguments as well as non-argumentative text.",
        "The contribution of our work is twofold.",
        "First, we present COMARG, a manually-annotated corpus for argument recognition from online discus-sions, which we make freely available.",
        "Secondly, we describe a supervised model for argument recognition based on comment-argument comparison.",
        "To address the fact that the arguments expressed in user comments are mostly vague and implicit, we use a series of semantic comment-argument comparison features based on semantic textual similarity (STS) and textual entailment (TE).",
        "To this end, we rely on state-of-the-art off-the-shelf STS and TE systems.",
        "We consider different feature subsets and argument recognition tasks of varying difficulty.",
        "Depending on task formulation, their performance ranges from 70.5% to 81.8% micro-averaged F1-score.",
        "Taking into account the difficulty of the task, we believe these results are promising.",
        "In partic-ular, we show that TE features work best when also taking into account the stance of the argument, and that a classifier trained to recognize arguments in one topic can be applied to another one with a decrease in performance of less than 3% F1-score.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "In the next section we review the related work.",
        "In Section 3 we describe the construction and annotation of the COMARG corpus.",
        "Section 4 describes the argument recognition model.",
        "In Section 5 we discuss the experimental results.",
        "Section 6 concludes the paper and outlines future work.",
        "2 Related Work Argument-based opinion mining is closely related to argumentation mining, stance classification, and opinion mining.",
        "Palau and Moens (2009) approach argumentation mining in three steps: (1) argument identification (determining whether a sentence is argu-mentative), (2) argument proposition classification (categorize argumentative sentences as premises or conclusions), and (3) detection of argumentation structure or ?argumentative parsing?",
        "(determining the relations between the arguments).",
        "The focus of their work is on legal text: the Araucaria corpus (Reed et al., 2008) and documents from the European Court of Human Rights.",
        "More recently, Cabrio and Villata (2012) explored the use of textual entailment for building argumentation networks and determining the acceptability of arguments.",
        "Textual entailment (TE) is a generic NLP framework for recognizing inference relations between two natural language texts (Dagan et al., 2006).",
        "Cabrio and Villata base their approach on Dung's argumentation theory (Dung, 1995) and apply it to arguments from online debates.",
        "After linking the arguments with sup-port/attack relations using TE, they are able to compute a set of acceptable arguments.",
        "Their system helps the participants to get an overview of a debate and the accepted arguments.",
        "Our work differs from the above-described work in that we do not aim to extract the argumenta-50 tion structure.",
        "Similarly to Cabrio and Villata (2012), we use TE as one of the features of our system to recognize the well-established arguments in user generated comments.",
        "However, aiming at argument-based opinion mining from noisy com-ments, we address a more general problem in which each comment may contain several arguments as well as non-argumentative text.",
        "Thus, in contrast to Cabrio and Villata (2012) who framed the problem as a binary yes/no entailment task, we tackle a more difficult five-class classification problem.",
        "We believe this is a more realistic task from the perspective of opinion mining.",
        "A task similar to argument recognition is that of stance classification, which involves identifying a subjective disposition towards a particular topic (Lin et al., 2006; Malouf and Mullen, 2008; So-masundaran and Wiebe, 2010; Anand et al., 2011; Hasan and Ng, 2013).",
        "Anand et al. (2011) classified stance on a corpus of posts across a wide range of topics.",
        "They analyzed the usefulness of meta-post features, contextual features, dependency fea-tures, and word-based features for signaling disagreement.",
        "Their results range from 54% to 69% accuracy.",
        "Murakami and Raymond (2010) identify general user opinions in online debates.",
        "They distinguish between global positions (opinions on the topic) and local positions (opinions on previous remarks).",
        "By calculating user pairwise rates of agreement and disagreement, users are grouped into ?support?",
        "and ?oppose?",
        "sets.",
        "In contrast to stance classification, argument recognition aims to uncover the reasons underlying an opinion.",
        "This relates to the well-established area of opinion mining.",
        "The main goal of opinion mining or sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008) is to analyze the opinions and emotions from (most often user-created) text.",
        "Opinions are often associated with user reviews (Kobayashi et al., 2007), unlike stances, which are more common for debates.",
        "Hasan and Ng (2013) characterize stance recognition as a more difficult task than opinion mining.",
        "Recently, however, there has been interesting work on combining argumentation mining and opinion mining (Ches?nevar et al., 2013; Grosse et al., 2012; Hogenboom et al., 2010).",
        "3 COMARG Corpus For training and evaluating argument recognition models, we have compiled a corpus of user com-ments, manually annotated with arguments, to which we refer as COMARG.",
        "The COMARG corpus is freely available for research purposes.",
        "2 3.1 Data Description As a source of data, we use two web sites: Pro-con.org 3 and Idebate.org.",
        "4 The former is a discussion site covering ideological, social, political, and other topics.",
        "Users express their personal opinions on a selected topic, taking either the pro or con side.",
        "Idebate.org is a debating website containing online debates and an archive of past debates.",
        "Each archived topic contains a set of prominent arguments presented in the debate.",
        "Each argument is labeled as either for or against the topic.",
        "The arguments are moderated and edited to provide the best quality of information.",
        "The two data sources are complementary to each other: Procon.org contains user comments, while Idebate.org contains the arguments.",
        "We manually identified near-identical topics covered by both web sites.",
        "From this set, we chose two topics: ?Un- der God in Pledge?",
        "(UGIP) and ?Gay Marriage?",
        "(GM).",
        "We chose these two topics because they have a larger-than-average number of comments (above 300) and are well-balanced between pro and con stances.",
        "For these two topics, we then took the corresponding comments and arguments from Pro-con.org and Idebate.org, respectively.",
        "As the users can post comments not relevant for the topic, we skim-read the comments and removed the spam.",
        "We end up with a set of 175 comments and 6 arguments for the UGIP topic, and 198 comments and 7 arguments for the GM topic.",
        "The comments are often verbose: the average number of words per comment is 116.",
        "This is in contrast to the less noisy dataset from Cabrio and Villata (2012), where the average comment length is 50 words.",
        "Each comment has an associated stance (pro or con), depending on how it was classified in Pro-con.org.",
        "Similarly, each argument either attacks or supports the claim of the topic, depending on how it was classified in Idebate.org.",
        "To simplify the ex-position, we will refer to them as ?pro arguments?",
        "and ?con arguments?.",
        "Table 1 shows the arguments for UGIP and GM topics.",
        "Users may attack or support both pro and con arguments.",
        "We will refer to the way how the argument is used (attacked or supported) as argument 2 Freely available under the CC BY-SA-NC license from http://takelab.fer.hr/data/comarg 3 http://www.procon.org 4 http://idebate.org 51 ?Under God in Pledge?",

        "Typically, but not necessarily, users who take the pro stance do so by supporting one of the pro arguments, and perhaps attacking some of the con arguments, while for users who take the con stance it is the other way around.",
        "3.2 Annotation The next step was to annotate, for each comment, the arguments used in the comment as well as their polarity.",
        "For each topic we paired all comments with all possible arguments for that topic, resulting in 1,050 and 1,386 comment-argument pairs for the UGIP and GM topics, respectively.",
        "We then asked the annotators (not the authors) to annotate each pair.",
        "The alternative would have been to ask the annotators to assign arguments to comments, but we believe annotating pairs reduces the annotation efforts and improves annotation quality.",

        "From EOP we used seven pre-trained entailment decision algorithms (EDAs).",
        "Some EDAs contain only syntactical features, whereas others rely on resources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).",
        "Each EDA outputs a binary decision (Entailment or NonEntailment) along with the degree of confidence.",
        "We use the outputs (decisions and confidences) of all seven EDAs as the features of our classifier (14 features in total).",
        "We also experimented with using additional features (the disjunction of all classifier decisions, the maximum confidence value, and the mean confidence value), but using these did not improve the performance.",
        "In principle, we expect the comment text (which is usually longer) to entail the argument phrase (which is usually shorter).",

        "In the second setting (As-N-sS), we conflate the two labels of equal polarity, thus we only consider whether an argument has been used and with what polarity.",
        "In the third setting (A-N-S), we only consider the comment-argument pairs in which arguments are either not used or used explicitly.",
        "This setting is not practically relevant, but we include it for purposes of comparison.",
        "We compare to two baselines: (1) a majority class classifier (MCC), which assigns label N to every instance, and (2) a bag-of-words overlap classifier (BoWO), which uses the word overlap between the comment and the argument as the only feature.",
