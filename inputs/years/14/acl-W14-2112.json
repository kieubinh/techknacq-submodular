        "Despite recent advances in discourse parsing and causality detection, the automatic recognition of argumentation structure of authentic texts is still a very challenging task.",

        "We experiment with different machine learning approaches for automatic argumentation structure recognition on various levels of granularity of the scheme.",

        "Automatic argumentation recognition has many possible applications, including improving document summarization (Teufel and Moens, 2002), retrieval capabilities of legal databases (Palau and Moens, 2011), opinion mining for commercial purposes, or also as a tool for assessing public opinion on political questions.",
        "However, identifying and classifying arguments in naturally-occurring text is a very challenging task for various reasons: argumentative strategies and styles vary across texts genres; classifying arguments might require domain knowledge; fur-thermore, argumentation is often not particularly explicit ?",
        "the argument proper is being infiltrated with the full range of problems of linguistic expression that humans have at their disposal.",
        "Although the amount of available texts featuring argumentative behaviour is growing rapidly in the web, we suggest there is yet one resource missing that could facilitate the development of automatic argumentation recognition systems: Short texts with explicit argumentation, little argumentatively irrelevant material, less rhetorical gimmicks (or even deception), in clean written language.",
        "For this reason, we conducted a text generation experiment, designed to control the linguistic and rhetoric complexity of written ?microtexts?.",
        "These texts have then been annotated with argumentation structures.",
        "We present first results of automatic classification of these arguments on various levels of granularity of the scheme.",
        "The paper is structured as follows: In the next section we describe related work.",
        "Section 3 presents the annotation scheme and an agreement study to prove the reliability.",
        "Section 4 describes the text generation experiment and the resulting corpus.",
        "Section 5 and 6 present the results of our first attempts in automatically recognizing the argumentative structure of those texts.",
        "Finally, Section 7 concludes with a summary and an outlook on future work.",
        "2 Related Work There exist a few ressources for the study of ar-gumentation, most importantly perhaps the AIF database, the successor of the Araucaria corpus (Reed et al., 2008), that has been used in different studies.",
        "It contains several annotated English datasets, most interestingly for us one covering online newspaper articles.",
        "Unfortunately, the full source text is not part of the downloadable database, which is why the linguistic material surrounding the extracted segments is not easy to retrieve for analysis.",
        "Instead of manually annotating, Cabrio and Villata (2012) created an argumentation resource by extracting argumentations from collaborative debate portals, such as debatepedia.org, where arguments are already classified into pro and con classes by the 88 users.",
        "Unfortunately, those arguments are themselves small texts and their internal argumentative structure is not marked up.",
        "Finally, to the best of our knowledge, the only existing corpus of German newspaper articles, essays or editorials annotated with argumentation structure is that used by Stede and Sauermann (2008), featuring ten commentaries from the Potsdam Commentary Corpus (Stede, 2004).",
        "Although short, these texts are rhetorically already quite complex and often have segments not relevant to the argument.1 In terms of automatic recognition, scientific documents of different fields have been studied intensively in the Argumentative Zoning approach or in similar text zoning approaches (Teufel and Moens, 2002; Teufel et al., 2009; Teufel, 2010; Liakata et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2013).",
        "Here, sentences are classified into different functional or conceptual roles, grouped together with adjacent sentences of the same class to document zones, which induces a flat partitioning of the text.",
        "A variety of machine learning schemes have been applied here.",
        "Another line of research approaches argumentation from the perspective of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988) and works with argumentation-enriched RST trees (Azar, 1999; Green, 2010).",
        "However, we do not consider RST to be the best level for representing argumentation, due to its linearization constraints (Peldszus and Stede, 2013a, sec.",
        "3).",
        "Nevertheless, noteworthy advances have been made recently in rhetorical parsing (Hernault et al., 2010; Feng and Hirst, 2012).",
        "Whether hybrid RST argumentation structures will profit similarly remains to be shown.",
        "A more linguistically oriented approach is given with the TextCoop platform (Saint-Dizier, 2012) for analyzing text on the discourse level with emphasis on argumentation.",
        "One step further, Feng and Hirst (2011) concentrate on types of arguments and use a statistical approach to classify already identified premises and conclusions into five common argumentation schemes (Walton et al., 2008).",
        "3 Annotation Scheme Our representation of the argumentation structure of a text is based on Freeman's theory of argumentation structure (Freeman, 1991; Freeman, 1We intend to use this resource, when we move on to experiment with more complex texts.",
        "2011).2 Its central idea is to model argumentation as a hypothetical dialectical exchange between the proponent, who presents and defends his claims, and the opponent, who critically questions them in a regimented fashion.",
        "Every move in such a dialectical exchange corresponds to a structural element in the argument graph.",
        "The nodes of this graph represent the propositions expressed in text segments (round nodes are proponent's nodes, square ones are opponent's nodes), the arcs between those nodes represent different supporting (arrow-head links) and attacking moves (circle- head links).",
        "The theory distinguishes only a few general supporting and attacking moves.",
        "Those could be specified further with a more fine grained set, as provided for example by the theory of argumentation schemes (Walton et al., 2008).",
        "Still, we focus on the coarse grained set, since this reduces the complexity of the already sufficiently challenging task of automatic argument identification and classifcation.",
        "Our adaption of Freeman's theory and the resulting annotation scheme is described in detail and with examples in (Peldszus and Stede, 2013a).",
        "3.1 Reliability of annotation The reliability of the annotation scheme has been evaluated in two experiments.",
        "We will first recapitulate the results of a previous study with naive annotators and then present the new results with expert annotators.",
        "Naive annotators: In (Peldszus and Stede, 2013b), we presented an agreement study with 26 naive and untrained annotators: undergraduate students in a ?class-room annotation?",
        "szenario, where task introduction, guideline reading and the actual annotation is all done in one obligatory 90 min.",
        "session and the subjects are likely to have different experience with annotation in gen-eral, background knowledge and motivation.",
        "We constructed a set of 23 microtexts (each 5 segments long) covering different linearisations of several combinations of basic argumentation constructs.",
        "An example text and the corresponding argumentation structure graph is shown in Figure 1.",
        "On these texts, the annotators achieved moderate agreement3 for certain aspects of the ar-2The theory aims to integrate the ideas of Toulmin (1958) into the argument diagraming techniques of the informal logic tradition (Beardsley, 1950; Thomas, 1974) in a systematic and compositional way.",

        "(Fleiss, 1971).",
        "89 gument graph (e.g. ?=.52 in distinguishing proponent and opponent segments, or ?=.58 in des-tinguishing supporting and attacking segments), yet only a marginal agreement of ?=.38 on the full labelset describing all aspects of the argument graph.",
        "However, we could systematically identify subgroups performing much better than average using clustering techniques: e.g. a subgroup of 6 annotators reached a relatively high IAA agreement of ?=.69 for the full labelset and also high agreement with gold data.",
        "Expert annotators: Here, we present the results of an agreement study with three expert an-notators: two of them are the guideline authors, one is a postdoc in computational linguistics.",
        "All three are familiar with discourse annotation tasks in general and specifically with this annotation scheme.",
        "They annotated the same set of 23 microtexts and achieved a high agreement of ?=.83 on the full labelset describing all aspects of the argument graph.",
        "The distinction between supporting and attacking was drawn with very high agreement of ?=.95, the one between proponent and opponent segments even with perfect agreement.",
        "Since argumentation structures can be reliably annotated using this scheme, we decided to create a small corpus of annotated microtexts.",
        "4 Dataset The corpus used in this study consists of two parts: on the one hand, the 23 microtexts used in the annotation experiments just described; on the other hand, 92 microtexts that have been collected in a controlled text generation experiment.",
        "We will describe this experiment in the following subsection.",
        "4.1 Microtext generation experiment We asked 23 probands to discuss a controversial issue in a short text of 5 segments.",
        "A list of 17 of these issues was given, concerning recent po-litical, moral, or everyday's life questions.",
        "Each proband was allowed to discuss at maximum five of the given questions.",
        "Probands were instructed to first think about the pros & cons of the controversial question, about possible refutation and counter-refutations of one side to the other.",
        "On this basis, probands should decide for one side and write a short persuasive text (corresponding to the standards of the written language), arguing in favour of their chosen position.",
        "The written texts were required to have a length of five segments.",
        "We decided not to bother our probands with an exact definition of a segment, as this would require the writers to reliably identify different complex syntactic constructions.",
        "In-stead, we simply characterized it as a clause or a sentence, expressing an argumentative point on its own.",
        "We also required all segments to be argumentatively relevant, in the sense that they either formulate the main claim of the text, support the main claim or another segment, or attack the main claim or another segment.",
        "This requirement was put forward in order to prevent digression and argumentatively irrelevant but common segment types, such as theme or mood setters, as well as background information.",
        "Furthermore, we demanded that at least one possible objection to the main claim be considered in the text, leaving open the choice of whether to counter that objection or not.",
        "Finally, the text should be written in such a way that it would be understandable without having the question as a headline.",
        "In total, 100 microtexts have been collected.",
        "The five most frequently chosen issues are: ?",
        "Should the fine for leaving dog excrements on sideways be increased?",
        "?",
        "Should shopping malls generally be allowed to open on Sundays?",
        "?",
        "Should Germany introduce the death penalty?",
        "?",
        "Should public health insurance cover treatments in complementary and alternative medicine?",
        "?",
        "Should only those viewers pay a TV licence fee who actually want to watch programs offered by public broadcasters?",
        "4.2 Cleanup and annotation Since we aim for a corpus of clean, yet authentic argumentation, all texts have been checked for spelling and grammar errors.",
        "As a next step, the texts were segmented into elementary units of argumentation.",
        "Due to the (re-)segmentation, not all texts conform to the length restriction of five seg-ments, they can be one segment longer or shorter.",
        "Unfortunately, some probands wrote more than five main clauses, yielding texts with up to ten segments.",
        "We decided to shorten these texts down to six segments by removing segments that appear redundant or negligible.",
        "This removal also required modifications in the remaining segments to maintain text coherence, which we made as 90 [Energy-saving light bulbs contain a considerable amount of toxic substances.]",

        "minimal as possible.",
        "Another source of problems were segments that do not meet our requirement of argumentative relevance.",
        "Some writers did not concentrate on discussing the thesis, but moved on to a different issue.",
        "Others started the text with an introductory presentation of background information, without using it in their argument.",
        "We removed those segments, again with minimal changes in the remaining segments.",
        "Some texts containing several of such segments remained too short after the removal and have been discarded from the dataset.",
        "After cleanup, 92 of the 100 written texts remained for annotation of argumentation structure.",
        "We found that a few texts did not meet the requirement of considering at least one objection to the own position.",
        "In a few other texts, the objection is not present as a full segment, but rather implicitly mentioned (e.g. in a nominal phrase or participle) and immediatly rejected in the very same segment.",
        "Those segments are to be annotated as a supporting segment according to the guidelines, since the attacking moves cannot be expressed as a relation between segments in this case.",
        "We will present some statistics of the resulting dataset at the end of the following subsection.",
        "5 Modelling In this section we first present, how the argumentation structure graphs can be interpreted as a segment-wise labelling that is suitable for automatic classification.",
        "We then describe the set of extracted features and the classifiers set up for recognition.",
        "5.1 Preparations In the annotation process, every segment is assigned one and only one function, i.e. every node in the argumentative graph has maximally one outgoing arc.",
        "The graph can thus be reinterpreted as a list of segment labels.",
        "Every segment is labeled on different levels: The ?role?-level specifies the dialectical role (pro- ponent or opponent).",
        "The ?typegen?-level specifies the general type, i.e. whether the segment presents the central claim (thesis) of the text, supports or attacks another segment.",
        "The ?type?-level additionally specifies the kind of support (normal or example) and the kind of attack (rebutter or under-cutter).",
        "Whether a segment's function holds only in combination with that of another segment (com- bined) or not (simple) is represented on the ?com- bined?-level.",
        "The target is finally specified by a position relative identifier: The offset -x. .",
        ".",
        "0. .",
        ".",
        "+x identifies the targeted segment, relative from the position of the current segment.",
        "The prefix ?n?",
        "states that the proposition of the node itself is the target, while the prefix ?r?",
        "states that the relation coming from the node is the target.",
        "The labels of each separate level can be merged to form a complex tagset.",
        "We interpret the result as a hierarchical tagset as it is presented in Figure 2.",
        "The label ?PSNS(n+2)?",
        "for example stands for a proponent's segment, giving normal, non-combined support to the next but one seg-ment, while ?OAUS(r-1)?",
        "represents an opponent's segment, undercutting the relation established by the immediately previous segment, not combined.",
        "Figure 1c illustrates the segment-wise labelling for the example microtext.",
        "The dataset with its 115 microtexts has 8183 word tokens, 2603 word types and 579 segments in total.",
        "The distribution of the basic labels and the complex ?role+type?",
        "level is presented in Table 1.",
        "The label distribution on the ?role+type?",
        "level shows that most of the opponent's attacks are rebutting attacks, directed against the central claim 4Segments with combined function (as e.g. linked supporting arguments) are represented by equal relation ids, which is why segments can have differing node and relation ids.",
        "However, for the sake of simplicity, we will only consider example of non-combined nature in this paper.",
        "91 Figure 2: The hierarchy of segment labels.",
        "or its premises directly (OAR>OAU).",
        "In contrast, the proponent's counters of these attack are typically untercutting attacks, directed against the attack relation (PAU>PAR).",
        "This is due to the au-thor's typical strategy of first conceding some aspect in conflict with the main claim and then rendering it irrelevant or not applicable without directly challenging it.",
        "Note however, that about 40% of the opponents objections have not been countered by the proponent (OA*>PA*).",
        "5.2 Features All (unsegmented) texts have been automatically split into sentences and been tokenized by the OpenNLP-tools.",
        "The mate-pipeline then processed the tokenized input, yielding lemmati-zation, POS-tags, word-morphology and dependency parses (Bohnet, 2010).",
        "The annotated gold-standard segmentation in the dataset was then automatically mapped to the automatic sentence-splitting/tokenization, in order to be able to extract exactly those linguistic features present in the gold-segments.",
        "Using this linguistic output and several other resources, we extracted the following features: Lemma Unigrams: We add a set of binary features for every lemma found in the present seg-ment, in the preceding and the subsequent segment in order to represent the segment's context in a small window.",
        "Lemma Bigrams: We extracted lemma bi-gramms of the present segment.",
        "POS Tags: We add a set of binary features for every POS tag found in the present, preceding and subsequent segment.",
        "Main verb morphology: We added binary features for tempus and mood of the segment's main verb, as subjunctive mood might indicate anticipated objections and tempus might help to identify the main claim.",
        "Dependency triples: The dependency parses were used to extract features representing dependency triples (relation, head, dependent) for each token of the present segment.",
        "Two features sets were built, one with lemma representations, the other with POS tag representations of head and dependent.",
        "Sentiment: We calculate the sentiment value of the current segment by summing the values of all lemmata marked as positive or negative in Sen-tiWS (Remus et al., 2010).5 Discourse markers: For every lemma in the segment that is listed as potentially signalling a discourse relation (cause, concession, contrast, asymmetriccontrast) in a lexicon of German discourse markers (Stede, 2002) we add a binary feature representing the occurance of the marker, and one representing the occurance of the relation.",
        "Again, discourse marker / relations in the preceding and subsequent segment are registered in separate features.",
        "First three lemmata: In order to capture sentence-initial expressions that might indicate argumentative moves, but are not strictly defined as discourse markers, we add binary features representing the occurance of the first three lemmata.",
        "Negation marker presence: We use a list of 76 German negation markers derived in (Warzecha, 2013) containing both closed class negation operators (negation particles, quantifiers and adverbials etc.)",
        "and open class negation operators (nouns like ?denial?",
        "or verbs like ?refuse?)",
        "to detect negation in the segment.",
        "Segment position: The (relative) position of the segment in the text might be helpful to identify typical linearisation strategies of argumentation.",
        "In total a number of ca. 19.000 features has been extracted.",
