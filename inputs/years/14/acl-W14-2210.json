        "Transcribed speech corpora and huge text corpora are the core of systems used to construct acoustic and language models (Jelinek, F. 1976).",
        "Constructing of large transcribed corpora is time consuming and expensive, even if some researchers (Hughes et al., 2010; Badenhorst et al., 2009; Schlippe et al., 2012; De Pauw et al., 2009) are working on how to create automatically and quickly speech corpora by using different systems including phone applications.",
        "If large transcribed speech corpora, more than 100 hours, exist for European languages like English, French or Spanish, the situation is quite different for African languages.",
        "About 2000 languages are spoken in Africa.",
        "Large part of them is not yet written and is today threatened of disappearing.",
        "Building speech Corpora and speech processing tools are crucial for each African language.",
        "In this paper we present in section 2 the Somali language.",
        "Section 3 will focus on the first Somali read-speech corpus called Asaas (Beginning in Somali) and also the first Web-Based Somali Language Model and text Corpus called Wargeys (Newspaper in Somali) in Section 4.",
        "2 Somali language Four languages are spoken in Djibouti.",
        "French and Arabic are official languages, Somali and Afar are native and widely spoken.",
        "Somali and Afar are Cushitic languages within the Afro-asi- atic family.",
        "Somali language is spoken in several countries in East of Africa (Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya) by a population estimated between 11 to 13 million of inhabitants.",
        "The different variants are Somali-somali, Somali-maay, Somali-dabarre, Somali-garre, Somali-jiiddu and Somali-tunni.",
        "Somali-somali and Somali-maay are the most widely spread variants (80% and 17%).",
        "We only process the Somali-somali vari-ant, commonly known as Somali language and spoken in Djibouti.",
        "The phonetic structure of this language has 22 consonants and 5 basic vowels which all occur in front and back versions (+ATR or -ATR).",
        "These 10 vowels occur in long and short pairs, giving 20 in total (Saeed, J. 1999).",
        "There are also 5 diphthongs which occur in front and back, long and short versions.",
        "Somali is also a tone accent language with 2 to 3 lexical tones (Hyman, L. 2010; Saeed, J. 1987; Gac, D. 2002).",
        "The written system was adopted in 1972, and there are no textual archives before this date.",
        "It uses Roman letters and doesn’t consider the tonal accent in the current form.",
        "Somali words are composed by the concatenation of syllable structures (Bendjaballah, S. 1998.",
        "Saeed, J.",
        "1999).",
        "3 3.1 Somali Read-Speech corpus Prompts Selection A series of documents was selected from Somali online newspapers that use variant Somali-Somali presented in Section 2.",
        "These texts are used to prepare the prompts.",
        "Particular attention was given to the quality of the selected texts (di- versity of topics, phoneme distribution, readabil-ity, number of errors, etc.).",
        "Table 1 shows the distribution of selected text.",
        "It consists of 72,407 words (representing 2,335 sentences) with 12,807 different words.",
        "Table 1: Distribution of selected text 3.2 Speakers selection French and Arabic languages are official languages in Djibouti.",
        "The transcription of Somali language in Roman letters facilitates its reading.",
        "But it is difficult to find persons who can read it fluently.",
        "Fifteen Somali-speaking men living in Djibouti and without any problem of pronunciation were preselected.",
        "At last 10 people were selected for recordings according to their reading fluency.",
        "Table 2 shows information on their social class, their study level and their age.",
        "All recorders were volunteers.",
        "which means \"beginning\" in the Somali language.",
        "Its phonetic distribution is given in Figure 1.",
        "We can consider that this distribution is well-balanced because it is quite similar to the one of the huge amount of the Somali text corpus (3 million of words).",
        "The phoneme /a/ occurs approximately 20 % of all the phonemes.",
        "The glottal phoneme /’/ ( ʔ in IPA) represents about 0,2%.",
        "Component Amount Sentences 2 335 Words 72 407 Different Words 12 807 Figure 1: Phonetic distribution of Asaas Corpus The duration of phonemes varies according to the speakers.",
        "However, in general, long vowels and fricatives are the longest ones.",
        "The short vowels and plosives have smaller duration.",
        "The phoneme which has the longest duration is /sh/ (∫ in IPA).",
        "The average duration of all phonemes is given in Figure 2.",
        "Plosives phonemes are split into two parts: the burst (Btt for the /t/ phoneme, Bkk for the /k/ one and the occlusion Ott for the /t/ one and Okk for the /k/).",
        "The average rate of the speech is 1.93 words per second.",
        "Spakers Initials Profession Study Level Age Aaa Technician secondary 30-40 Abg Researcher University 40-50 Ahd Journalist secondary 40-50 Hha Businessman secondary 30-40 Hhdj Technician secondary 20-30 Hnm Jobless secondary 30-40 Ind Technician secondary 20-30 Ism Policemen University 40-50 Mar Writer University 50-60 sha Writer University 50-60 Table 2: Speakers Characteristics 3.3 Recordings The recordings took place in the Djibouti Institute of Science and Information Technologies.",
        "They were recorded in mono in an office without any environment noise (fan, air-conditioner, phone, etc.)",
        "with a standard microphone with a sampling frequency of 16 KHz and a 16-bit encoding.",
        "3.4 Corpus characteristics The duration of the Somali read-speech corpus is 10 hours and 26 minutes.",
        "We named it Asaas, Figure 2: average duration of phonemes There is a real difference between the duration of short and long vowels.",
        "Thus, long /a/ (written aa is Somali) is 2 times longer than the short /a/ (written a in Somali) and the /uu/ is 1.75 times longer than the /u/.",
        "On average, the ratio of 74 duration between long and short vowels is 1.86.",
        "A comparison of the duration of long and short vowels is given in Figure 3.",
        "This feature can be used in acoustic modeling by creating two separate models for each vowel (long and short).",
        "It is also possible to recognize them with the language model.",
        "But both language model and separate acoustic models will probably improve the Word Error Rate.",
        "Many researchers are involved on how to create automatically textual corpora from the Internet for under-resourced languages (Ghani et al., 2001.",
        "Vaufreydaz et al., 1999).",
        "For our purposes we selected and downloaded a set of Somali newspapers on the Internet.",
        "As the audio corpus, the selection criteria were the variant of the language, the diversity of topics and the number of errors.",
        "4.1 Formatting The text downloaded is not directly usable.",
        "After removal of HTML tags, we proceeded to some transformations dealing with abbreviations, dates and times, numbers, proper names, foreign words and punctuation.",
        "4.2 Spelling normalization The Somali language as most of African languages is written after the independence period (1960-1970).",
        "So the orthography is not yet stabilized.",
        "The same word can be written in different ways according to people.",
        "Calvet, L. (1987) shows that the word eight in Mandingo is written segin in Mali, seyin in Guinea and seegin in Burkina Faso.",
        "In Somali Language the word President appears like madaxweyne or madaxwayne.",
        "This lack of standardization is common for most of the African languages and disrupts the language models quality as well as the Automatic Speech Recognition systems accuracy.",
        "To resolve this problem, for a given simple word like madaxweyne we considered that the most frequent spelling is the good one.",
        "If madaxweyne appears 17 times in the corpus and madaxwayne 9 times, Madaxweyne is selected and all the madaxwayne were changed to madaxweyne.",
        "For the component words like iskumid and isku mid, we choice the separate orthography like isku mid.",
        "This choice is made to separate syllable because if iskumid (Perhaps Out of Vocabulary Word) is not recognized by a ASR system, isku can be recognized or mid can be recognized.",
        "4.3 Corpus Characteristics Somali web-based textual corpus was named WARGEYS (Newspaper in Somali) because this corpus contains News topics and is similar to the French one called BREF (Lamel, L 1991) and gathered from the French newspaper Le Monde.",
        "Table 4 shows the characteristics of this corpus.",
        "WARGEYS contains 2 820 000 words with 121 4 Figure 3: Duration of long and short vowels Somali Text Corpus Corpus containing millions of words or even billions of words is usually used for language modeling.",
        "If these data are mostly available for English and French languages, it is quite different for newly written languages like African languages.",
        "The lack of textual data constitutes a real handicap.",
        "Grefenstette (2002) shows that African languages are gaining ground on the Web, even if European languages are largely dominant.",
        "Despite this growth their presence on the web is insufficient.",
        "This growth is relative, because in large part due to South African websites.",
        "Shigeaki (2008) clearly shows the prominence of South African sites on the continent.",
        "Grefenstette and Nioche (2000) propose a formula to estimate the number of words found on the Internet for a given language.",
        "For this, we divide the number of times a word has been found by a search engine in cyberspace by the relative frequency of the word in that language.",
        "The average result on a predefined list of words provides an estimation of the number of words on the web.",
        "Estimation calculated in March 2014 for the Somali language gives about 500 million Somali words on the Web.",
        "The frequency of Somali words used was calculated on the textual corpus WARGEYS.",
        "75 000 different words and 84 000 sentences with an average of 33 words per sentence.",
        "Table 1: Distribution WARGEYS corpus The figure 4 shows that the phonetic distribution of the two corpus Asaas and WARGEYS are similar.",
        "Component Amount Words 2 820 000 Different words 121 000 Sentences 84 000 5 Figure 4: Phonetic distribution of Asaas and WARGEYS corpora Conclusion Somali read-speech corpus Asaas, consists of 10 hours and 26 minutes of good quality signal fully transcribed and well corrected.",
        "The phonetic distribution of this corpus is well-balanced.",
        "The Web-based Somali textual corpus WARGEYS contains 3 million of words and more than 120 000 different words.",
        "This corpus is formatted and the spelling fluctuation is standardized."
