        "Metaphors are used to replace complicated or unfamiliar ideas with familiar, yet unrelated concepts that share an important attribute with the intended idea.",
        "In NLP, detecting metaphors and other non-literal figures of speech is necessary to interpret their meaning correctly.",
        "As metaphors are a productive part of language, listing known examples is not sufficient.",
        "Most computational approaches to metaphor detection are based either on the theory of conceptual mappings (Lakoff and John-son, 1980) or that of preference violation (Wilks, 1978).",
        "Lakoff and Johnson (1980) showed that metaphors have underlying mappings between two conceptual domains: The figurative source domain that the metaphor is taken from and the literal target domain of the surrounding context in which it has to be interpreted.",
        "Various metaphors can be based on the same conceptual metaphor mapping, e.g. both ?The economy is a house of cards?",
        "and ?the stakes of our debates appear small?",
        "match POLITICS IS A GAME.",
        "Another attribute of metaphors is that they violate semantic selectional preferences (Wilks, 1978).",
        "The theory of selectional preference observes that verbs constrain their syntactic arguments by the semantic concepts they accept in these positions.",
        "Metaphors violate these con-straints, combining incompatible concepts.",
        "To make use of these theories, extensive knowledge of pairings (either mappings or preferences) and the involved conceptual domains is required.",
        "Especially in the case of conceptual mappings, this makes it very difficult for automated systems to achieve appropriate coverage of metaphors.",
        "Even when limited to a single target domain, detecting all metaphors would require knowledge of many metaphoric source domains to cover all relevant mappings (which themselves have to be known, too).",
        "As a result of this, many systems attempt to achieve high precision for specific mappings, rather than provide general coverage.",
        "Many approaches (Gedigian et al., 2006; Krish-nakumaran and Zhu, 2007; Mohler et al., 2013; Tsvetkov et al., 2013, and more) make use of manually crafted knowledge bases such as WordNet or FrameNet to establish concept domains.",
        "Other recent works establish domains via topic modeling (Shutova et al., 2010; Heintz et al., 2013), ad-hoc clustering (Strzalkowski et al., 2013) or by using semantic similarity vectors (Hovy et al., 2013).",
        "We introduce term relevance as a measure for how ?out of place?",
        "a word is in a given con-18 text.",
        "Our hypothesis is that words will often be out of place because they are not meant literally, but rather metaphorically.",
        "Term relevance is based on term frequency measures for target domains and mixed-domain data.",
        "The advantage of this approach is that it only requires knowledge of a text's literal target domain, but none about any source domains or conceptual mappings.",
        "As it does not require sentence structure information, it is also resistant to noisy data, allowing the use of large, uncurated corpora.",
        "While some works that utilize domain-mappings circumvent the need for pre-existing source data by generating it themselves (Strzalkowski et al., 2013; Mohler et al., 2013), our approach is truly source-independent.",
        "We present a threshold classifier that uses term relevance as its only metric for metaphor detection.",
        "In addition we evaluate the impact of term relevance at different training sizes.",
        "Our contributions are: ?",
        "We present a measure for non-literalness that only requires data for the literal domain(s) of a text.",
        "?",
        "Our approach detects metaphors independently of their source domain.",
        "?",
        "We report improvements for F 1 of 58% (stand-alone) and 68% (multi-feature) over a random baseline.",
        "2 Term Relevance We hypothesize that novel metaphoric language is marked by its unusualness in a given context.",
        "There will be a clash of domains, so the vocabulary will be noticeably different 1 .",
        "Therefore, an unusual choice of words may indicate metaphoric-ity (or non-literalness, at the least).",
        "We measure this fact through a domain-specific term relevance metric.",
        "The metric consists of two features: Domain relevance, which measures whether a term is typical for the literal target domain of the text, and common relevance, which indicates terms that are so commonly used across domains that they have no discriminative power.",
        "If a term is not typical for a text's domain (i.e. 1 Strongly conventionalized metaphors will not meet this expectation, as they have become part of the target domain's vocabulary.",
        "Such metaphors can be easily detected by conventional means, such as knowledge bases.",
        "Our concern is therefore focused on novel metaphors.",
        "has a low relevance), but is not very common ei-ther, it is considered a metaphor candidate.",
        "This can of course be extended to multiple literal domains (e.g. a political speech on fishing regulations will have both governance and maritime vo-cabulary), in which case a word is only considered as a metaphor if it is untypical for all domains involved.",
        "2.1 Metric We base domain relevance on TF-IDF (term frequency inverse document frequency), which is commonly used to measure the impact of a term on a particular document.",
        "Terms with a great impact receive high scores, while low scores are assigned to words that are either not frequent in the document or otherwise too frequent among other documents.",
        "We adapt this method for domain relevance (dr) by treating all texts of a domain as a single ?doc- ument?.",
        "This new term frequency inverse domain frequency measures the impact of a term on the domain.",
        "tf dom (t, d) = # of term t in domain d # of terms in domain d (1) idf dom (t) = log # of domains # of domains containing t (2) dr(t, d) = tf dom (t, d)?",
        "idf dom (t) (3) To detect metaphors, we look for terms with low scores in this feature.",
        "However, due to the nature of TF-IDF, a low score might also indicate a word that is common among all domains.",
        "To filter out such candidates, we use normalized document frequency as a common relevance indicator.",
        "cr(t) = # of documents containing t # of documents (4) In theory, we could also use domain frequency to determine common relevance, as we already compute it for domain relevance.",
        "However, as this reduces the feature's granularity and otherwise behaves the same (as long as domains are of equal size), we keep regular document frequency.",
        "2.2 Generating Domains We need an adequate number of documents for each domain of interest to compute domain relevance for it.",
        "We require specific data for the literal domain(s) of a text, but none for the metaphor's 19 source domains.",
        "This reduces the required number of domain data sets significantly without ruling out any particular metaphor mappings.",
        "We extract domain-specific document collections from a larger general corpus, using the keyword query search of Apache Lucene 2 , a software for indexed databases.",
        "The keywords of the query search are a set of seed terms that are considered typical literal terms for a domain.",
        "They can be manually chosen or extracted from sample data.",
        "For each domain we extract the 10,000 highest ranking documents and use them as the domain's dataset.",
        "Afterwards, all remaining documents are randomly assigned to equally sized pseudo-domain datasets.",
        "These pseudo-domains allow us to compute the inverse of the domain frequency for the TF-IDF without the effort of assigning all documents to proper domains.",
        "The document frequency score that will be used as common relevance is directly computed on the documents of the complete corpus.",
        "3 Data We make use of two different corpora.",
        "The first is the domain-independent corpus required for computing term relevance.",
        "The second is an evaluation corpus for the governance domain on which we train and test our systems.",
        "Both corpora are preprocessed using NLTK (Loper and Bird, 2002) 3 .",
        "After tokenization, stopwords and punctuation are removed, contractions expanded (e.g. we?ve to we have) and numbers generalized (e.g. 1990's to @?s).",
        "The remaining words are reduced to their stem to avoid data sparsity due to morphological variation.",
        "In case of the domain corpus, we also removed generic web document contents, such as HTML mark-up, JavaScript/CSS code blocks and similar boilerplate code 4 .",
        "3.1 Domain Corpus As a basis for term relevance, we require a large corpus that is domain-independent and ideally also style-independent (i.e. not a newspaper corpus or 2 http://lucene.apache.org/core/ 3 http://nltk.org 4 Mark-up and boilerplate removal scripts adapted from http://love-python.blogspot.com/ 2011/04/html-to-text-in-python.html and http://effbot.org/zone/re-sub.htm Wikipedia).",
        "The world wide web meets these requirements.",
        "However, we cannot use public online search engines, such as Google or Bing, because they do not allow a complete overview of their indexed documents.",
        "As we require this provide to generate pseudo-domains and compute the inverse document/domain frequencies, we use a precom-piled web corpus instead.",
        "ClueWeb09 5 contains one billion web pages, half of which are English.",
        "For reasons of processing time and data storage, we limited our experiments to a single segment (en0000), containing 3 million documents.",
        "The time and storage considerations apply to the generation of term relevance values during preprocessing, due to the requirements of database indexing.",
        "They do not affect the actual metaphor detection process, therefore, we do not expect scalability to be an issue.",
        "As ClueWeb09 is an unfiltered web corpus, spam filtering was required.",
        "We removed 1.2 million spam documents using the Waterloo Spam Ranking for ClueWeb09 6 by Cormack et al. (2011).",
        "3.2 Evaluation Corpus Evaluation of the two classifiers is done with a corpus of documents related to the concept of governance.",
        "Texts were annotated for metaphoric phrases and phrases that are decidedly in-domain, as well as other factors (e.g. affect) that we will not concern ourselves with.",
        "The focus of annotation was to exhaustively mark metaphors, irrespective of their novelty, but avoid idioms and metonymy.",
        "The corpus is created as part of the MICS: Metaphor Interpretation in terms of Culturally-relevant Schemas project by the U.S. Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA).",
        "We use a snapshot containing 2,510 English sen-tences, taken from 312 documents.",
        "Of the 2,078 sentences that contain metaphors, 72% contain only a single metaphoric phrase.",
        "The corpus consists of around 48k tokens, 12% of which are parts of metaphors.",
        "Removing stopwords and punctuation reduces it to 23k tokens and slightly skews the distribution, resulting in 15% being metaphors.",
        "We divide the evaluation data into 80% development and 20% test data.",
        "All reported results are based on test data.",
        "Where training data is required for model training (see section 5), ten-fold cross validation is performed on the development set.",

        "The 10k documents with the highest relevance to the seeds are assigned to the subdomain cluster.",

        "Preliminary experiments showed that this provides better performance than using a single domain corpus with more documents.",
        "As the first set of seeds is chosen without statistical basis, the resulting clusters might miss important aspects of the domain.",
        "To ensure that our evaluation is not influenced by this, we also introduce a second seed set, which is directly based on the development data.",
        "As we mentioned in section 3.2, sentences in the MICS corpus were not only annotated for metaphoric phrases, but also for such that are decidedly domain-relevant.",
        "For example in the sentence ?Our economy is the strongest on earth?, economy is annotated as in-domain and strongest as metaphor.",
        "Based on these annotations, we divide the entire development data into three bags of words, one each for metaphor, in-domain and unmarked words.",
        "We then compute TF-IDF values for these bags, as we did for the domain clusters.",
        "The fifty terms 9 that score highest for the in-domain bag (i.e. those that make the texts identifiable as governance texts) are used as the second set of seeds (ta- ble 2).",
        "It should be noted that while the seeds were based on the evaluation corpus, the resulting term relevance features were nevertheless computed using clusters extracted from the web corpus.",
        "8 As our evaluation corpus does not specify secondary domains for its texts (e.g. fishery), we chose not to define any further domains at this point.",
        "9 Various sizes were tried for the seed set.",

        "Further factors in their decision process are co-ocurrences in surrounding sentences and psycholinguistic image-ability scores (i.e. how easy it is to form a mental picture of a word).",
        "Evaluating on data in the governance domain, they achieve an accuracy of 71% against an all metaphor baseline of 46%, but report no precision or recall.",
        "Mohler et al. (2013) and Heintz et al. (2013) also evaluate on the governance domain.",
        "Rather than detecting metaphors at a word-level, both detect whether sentences contain metaphors.",
        "Mohler et al. (2013) compare semantic signatures of sentences to signatures of known metaphors.",
        "They, too, face a strong bias against the metaphor label and show how this can influence the balance between precision and recall.",
        "Heintz et al. (2013) classify sentences as containing metaphors if their content is related to both a target and source domain.",
        "They create clusters via topic modeling and, like us, use manually chosen seed terms to associate them with domains.",
        "Unlike our approach, theirs also requires seeds of all relevant source domains.",

        "Shutova et al. (2010) use manually annotated seed sentences to generate source and target domain vocabularies via spectral clustering.",
        "The resulting domain clusters are used for selectional preference induction in verb-noun relations.",
        "They report a high precision of 0.79, but have no data on recall.",
        "Target concepts appearing in similar lexico-syntactic contexts are mapped to the same source concepts.",
        "The resulting mappings are then used to detect metaphors.",
        "This approach is notable for its combination of distributional clustering and selectional preference induction.",
        "Verbs and nouns are clustered into topics and linked through induction of selectional preferences, from which metaphoric mappings are deduced.",
        "Other works (S?eaghdha, 2010; Ritter et al., 2010) use topic modeling to directly induce selectional preferences, but have not yet been applied to metaphor detection.",
        "Hovy et al. (2013) generalize semantic preference violations from verb-noun relations to any syntactic relation and learn these in a supervised manner, using SVM and CRF models.",
        "The CRF is not the overall best-performing system, but achieves the highest precision of 0.74 against an all-metaphor baseline of 0.49.",
        "This is in line with our own observations.",
        "While they argue that metaphor detection should eventually be performed on every word, their evaluation is limited to a single expression per sentence.",
        "Our work is also related to that of Sporleder and Li (2009) and Li and Sporleder (2010), in which they detect idioms through their lack of semantic cohesiveness with their context.",
        "Cohesiveness is measured via co-occurence of idiom candidates with other parts of a text in web searches.",
        "They do not make use of domains, basing their measure entirely on the lexical context instead.",
        "7 Conclusion We have presented term relevance as a non-literalness indicator and its use for metaphor detection.",
        "We showed that even on its own, term relevance clearly outperforms the baseline by 58% when detecting metaphors on a word basis.",
        "We also evaluated the utility of term relevance as a feature in a larger system.",
        "Results for this were mixed, as the general performance of our system, a sequential CRF classifier, was lower than anticipated.",
        "However, tests on smaller training sets suggest that term relevance can help when data is sparse (as it often is for metaphor process-ing).",
        "Also, precision was considerably higher for CRF, so it might be more useful for cases where coverage is of secondary importance.",
        "For future work we plan to reimplement the underlying idea of term relevance with different means.",
        "Domain datasets could be generated via topic modeling or other clustering means (Shutova et al., 2010; Heintz et al., 2013) and should also cover dynamically detected secondary target domains.",
        "Instead of using TF-IDF, term relevance can be modeled using semantic vector spaces (see Hovy et al. (2013)).",
        "While our preliminary tests showed better performance for CRF than for SVM, such a change in feature representation would also justify a re-evaluation of our classifier choice.",
        "To avoid false positives (and thus improve precision), we could generate ad-hoc source do-mains, like Strzalkowski et al. (2013) or Shutova et al. (2010) do, to detect overlooked literal connections between source and target domain.",
