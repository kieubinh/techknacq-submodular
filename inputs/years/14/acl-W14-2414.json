        "Dependency-based Compositional Semantics (DCS) was proposed as an interface for querying relational databases by natural language.",
        "It features DCS trees as semantic representation, with a structure similar to dependency trees.",
        "In its basic version, a node of a DCS tree indicates a table in the database, and an edge indicates a join relation.",
        "Both ends of an edge are labeled by a field of the corresponding table (Liang et al., 2011).",
        "However, when DCS is applied to logical inference on unrestricted texts, it is unrealistic to assume an explicit database, because we cannot prepare a database for everything in the world.",
        "For this reason, DCS trees are detached from any specific relational database, in a way that each node of a DCS tree indicates a content word in a sentence (thus no fixed set of possible word labels for a DCS tree node), and each edge indicates ?",
        "Current affiliation of the first author: Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University, Japan.",
        "Email address: tianran@ecei.tohoku.ac.jp a semantic relation between two words.",
        "Labels on the two ends of an edge, initially indicating fields of tables in a database, are considered as semantic roles of the corresponding words.",
        "Abstract denotation is proposed to capture the meaning of this abstract version of DCS tree, and a textual inference system based on abstract denotation is built (Tian et al., 2014).",
        "It is quite natural to apply DCS trees, a simple and expressive semantic representation, to textual inference; however the use of abstract denotations to convey logical inference is somehow unusual.",
        "There are two seemingly obvious way to equip DCS with logical inference: (i) at the tree level, by defining a set of logically sound transformations of DCS trees; or (ii) at the logic level, by converting DCS trees to first order predicate logic (FOL) formulas and then utilizing a theorem prover.",
        "For (i), it may not be easy to enumerate all types of logically sound transformations, but tree transformations can be seen as an approximation of logical inference.",
        "For (ii), abstract denotation is more efficient than FOL formula, because abstract denotation eliminates quantifiers and meanings of natural language texts can be represented by atomic sentences.",
        "To elaborate the above discussion and to provide more topics to the literature, in this paper we discuss the following four questions: (?2) How well can tree transformation approximate logical inference?",
        "(?3) With rigorous inference on DCS trees, where does logic contribute in the system of Tian et al. (2014)?",
        "(?4) Does logical inference have further potentials in Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) task?",
        "and (?5) How efficient is abstract denotation compared to FOL formula?",
        "We provide examples or experimental results to the above questions.",

        "For example in Figure 1, it is possible to extract the rule blamed for death?",
        "cause loss of life, but not easy to extract tropical storm Debby?",
        "storm, because ?Debby?",
        "could be an arbitrary name which may not even appear in the corpus.",
        "This kind of gaps was typically addressed by approximate matching methods, for example by counting common sub-graphs of T and H, or by computing a cost of tree edits that convert T to H. In the example of Figure 1, we would expect that T is ?similar enough?",
        "(i.e. has many common sub-graphs) with H, or the cost to convert T into H (e.g. by deleting the node Debby and then add the node storm) is low.",
        "As for how similar is enough, or how the cost is evaluated, we will need a statistical model to train on RTE development set.",
        "It was neglected that some combinations of tree edits are logical (while some are not).",
        "The entailment pair in Figure 1 can be easily treated by logical inference, as long as the apposition tropical storm = Debby is appropriately handled.",
        "In contrast to graph matching or tree edit models which theoretically admit arbitrary tree transformation, logical inference clearly discriminate sound transformations from unsound ones.",
        "In this sense, there would be no need to train on RTE data.",
        "When coreference is considered, logically sound tree transformations can be quite complicated.",
        "The following is a modified example from RTE2-dev: T: Hurricane Isabel, which caused significant damage, was a tropical storm when she entered Virginia.",

        "The corresponding DCS trees are shown in Figure 2.",
        "Though the DCS trees of T and H are quite different, H can actually be proven from T. Note the coreference between Hurricane Isabel and she, suggesting us to copy the subtree of Hurricane Isabel to she, in a tree edit approach.",
        "This is not enough yet, because the head storm in T is not placed at the subject of cause.",
        "The issue is indeed very logical: from ?Hurricane Isabel = she?, ?Hurricane Isabel = storm?, ?she = subject of en-ter?",
        "and ?Hurricane Isabel = subject of cause?, we can imply that ?storm = subject of enter = subject of cause?.",
        "3 Alignment with logical clues Tian et al. (2014) proposed a way to generate on-the-fly knowledge to fill knowledge gaps: if H is not proven, compare DCS trees of T and H to generate path alignments (e.g. blamed for death ?",
        "cause loss of life, as underscored in Figure 1); evaluate the path alignments by a similarity score function; and path alignments with a score greater than a threshold (0.4) are accepted and converted to inference rules.",
        "The word vectors Tian et al. (2014) use to calculate similarities are reported able to capture semantic compositions by simple additions and subtractions (Mikolov et al., 2013).",
        "This is also the case when used as knowledge resource for RTE, for example the similarities between blamed+death and cause+loss+life, or between found+shot+dead and killed, are computed > 0.4.",
        "However, generally such kind of similarity is very noisy.",
        "Tian et al. (2014) used some logical clues to filter out irrelevant path alignments, which helps to keep a high precision.",
        "To evaluate the effect of such logical filters, we compare it with some other alignment strategies, the performance of which on RTE5-test data is shown in Table 1.",
        "Each strategy is described in the following.",

(2014) 1 , which use logical clues to filter out irrelevant path alignments, and apply accepted path alignments as inference rules.",
        "LexNoun + Inference The same system as above, except that we only align paths between lexically aligned nouns.",
        "Two nouns are aligned if and only if they are synonyms, hyponyms or derivatively related in WordNet.",
        "LexNoun + Coverage As above, paths between lexically aligned nouns are aligned, and aligned paths with similarity score > 0.4 are accepted.",
        "If all nodes in H can be covered by some accepted path alignments, then output ?Y?.",

        "NoFilter + Coverage Same as above, but all paths alignments with similarity score > 0.4 are accepted.",
        "4 How can logical inference help RTE?",
        "Logical inference is shown to be useful for RTE, as Tian et al. (2014) demonstrates a system with competitive results.",
        "However, despite the expectation that all entailment matters can be explained logically, our observation is that currently logical inference only fills very limited short gaps from T to H. The logical phenomena easily addressed by Tian et al. (2014)'s framework, namely universal quantifiers and negations, seems rare in PASCAL RTE data.",
        "Most heavy lifting is done by distributional similarities between phrases, which may fail in complicated sentences.",
        "An especially complex example is: T: Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said Tuesday that a Massachusetts judge had granted its motion to decertify a class action lawsuit accusing the world's largest retailer of denying employees breaks.",

        "However, it may be possible to build a priori logical models at the meta level, such as on epistemic, intentional and reportive attitudes.",

        "We hope this approach can bring new progress to RTE and other semantic processing tasks.",
        "5 Efficiency of abstract denotations To evaluate the efficiency of logical inference on abstract denotations, we took 110 true entailment pairs from RTE5 development set, which are also pairs that can be proven with on-the-fly knowledge.",
        "We plot the running time of Tian et al. (2014)'s inference engine (single-threaded) on a 2.27GHz Xeon CPU, with respect to the weighted sum of all statements 2 , as shown in Figure 3.",
        "The graph shows all pairs can be proven in 6 seconds, and proof time scales logarithmically on weight of statements.",

        "column), and only 16% pairs can be proven in 5 minutes (the ?Orig.",
        "5 Min.?",
        "column), showing severe difficulties for an FOL prover to handle textual inferences with many (usually hundreds of) on-the-fly rules.",
        "As such, we use Tian et al. (2014)'s inference engine to pin down statements that are actually needed for proving H (usually just 2 or 3 statements), and try to prove H by Prover9 again, using only necessary statements.",
        "Proven pairs in 5 minutes then jump to 82% (the ?Red.",
        "5 Min.?",
        "column), showing that a large number of on-the-fly rules may drastically increase computation cost.",
        "Still, nearly 20% pairs cannot be proven even in this setting, suggesting that traditional FOL prover is not suited for textual inference.",
        "6 Conclusion and future work We have discussed the role that logical inference could play in RTE task, and the efficiency of performing inference on abstract denotations.",
        "Though currently logical inference contributes at places that are somehow inconspicuous, there is the possibility that with some meta level logical models and the methodology of semantic parsing, we can build systems that understand natural language texts deeply: logic implies (in)consistency, which is in turn used as signals to produce more accurate semantic interpretation.",
        "And after all, as there may be many possible variations of semantic representations, it is good to have an efficient inference framework that has the potential to connect them.",
        "It would be exciting if we can combine different types of structured data with natural language in semantic processing tasks.",
        "Directions of our future work are described below.",
        "Improvement of similarity score To calculate phrase similarities, Tian et al. (2014) use the cosine similarity of sums of word vectors, which ignores syntactic information.",
        "We plan to add syntactic information to words by some supertags, and learn a vector space embedding for this structure.",
        "Integration of FreeBase to RTE It would be exciting if we can utilize the huge amount of FreeBase data in RTE task.",
        "Using the framework of abstract denotation, meanings of sentences can be explained as relational database queries; to convert it to FreeBase data queries is like relational to ontology schema matching.",
        "In order to make effective use of FreeBase data, we also need to recognize entities and relations in natural language sentences.",
        "Previous research on semantic parsing will be very helpful for learning such mapping.",
        "Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) As the RTE task, WSC (Levesque et al., 2012) also provides a test bed for textual inference systems.",

        "The logical interplay among decided, hopes, even though, because, and the realization that he is coreferent to Michael (but not his father) is intriguing.",
        "By working on the task, we hope to gain further understanding on how knowledge can be gathered and applied in natural language reasoning.",
