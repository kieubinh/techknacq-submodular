        "Content analysis, a technique for finding evidence of concepts of theoretical interest through text, is an increasingly popular technique social scientists use in their research investigations.",
        "In the process commonly known as ?coding?, social scientists often have to painstakingly comb through large quantities of natural language corpora to annotate text segments (e.g., phrase, sen-tence, and paragraphs) with codes exhibiting the concepts of interest (Miles & Huberman, 1994).",
        "Analyzing textual data is very labor-intensive, time-consuming, and is often limited to the capabilities of individual researchers (W. Evans, 1996).",
        "The coding process becomes even more demanding as the complexity of the project increases especially in the case of attempting to apply a multidimensional coding scheme with a significant number of codes (D?nmez, Ros?, Stegmann, Weinberger, & Fischer, 2005).",
        "With the proliferation and availability of digital texts, it is challenging, if not impossible, for human coders to manually analyze torrents of text to help advance social scientists?",
        "understanding of the practices of different populations of interest through textual data.",
        "Therefore, computational methods offer significant benefits to help augment human capabilities to explore massive amounts of text in more complex ways for theory generation and theory testing.",
        "Content analysis can be framed as a text classification problem, where each text segment is labeled based on a predetermined set of categories or codes.",
        "Full automation of content analysis is still far from being perfect (Grimmer & Stewart, 2013).",
        "The accuracy of current automatic approaches on the best performing codes in social science research ranges from 60-90% (Broadwell et al., 2013; Crowston, Allen, & Heckman, 2012; M. Evans, McIntosh, Lin, & Cates, 2007; Ishita, Oard, Fleischmann, Cheng, & Templeton, 2010; Zhu, Kraut, Wang, & Kittur, 2011).",
        "While the potential of automatic content analysis is promis-ing, computational methods should not be viewed as a replacement for the role of the primary researcher in the careful interpretation of text.",
        "Rather, the computers?",
        "pattern recognition capabilities can be leveraged to seek out the most likely examples for each code of interest, thus reducing the amount of texts researchers have to read and process.",
        "We propose a semi-automatic method that promotes a close human-computer partnership for content analysis.",
        "Machine learning (ML) is used to perform the first pass of coding on the unlabeled texts.",
        "Human annotators then have to correct only what the ML model identifies as positive examples of each code.",
        "The initial ML 44 model needs to learn only from a small set of hand-coded examples (i.e., gold standard data), and will evolve and improve as machine annotations that are verified by human annotators are used to incrementally retrain the model.",
        "In contrast to conventional machine learning, this ?ac- tive learning?",
        "approach will significantly reduce the amount of training data needed upfront from the human annotators.",
        "However, it is still equally important to optimize the creation of the initial ML model given less training data so that the model is able to capture most if not all positive examples, and filter out as many negative examples as possible for human annotators to correct.",
        "To effectively implement the active learning approach for coding qualitative data, we have to first understand the nature and complexity of content analysis projects in social science research.",
        "Our pilot case study, an investigation of leadership behaviors exhibited in emails from a FLOSS development project (Misiolek, Crow-ston, & Seymour, 2012), reveals that it is common for researchers to use a multidimensional coding scheme consisting of a significant number of codes in their research inquiry.",
        "Previous work has shown that not all dimensions in a multidimensional coding scheme could be applied fully automatically with acceptable level of accuracy (D?nmez et al., 2005) but little is known if it is possible at all to train an optimal model for all codes using the same combination of features.",
        "Also, the distribution of codes is often times uneven with some rarely occurring codes having only few positive examples in the gold standard corpus.",
        "This paper presents our attempt in optimizing the initial ML model through feature exploration using gold standard data created from a multidimensional coding scheme, including codes that suffer from sparseness of positive examples.",
        "Specifically, our study is guided by two research questions: a) How can features for an initial machine learning model be optimized for all codes in a text classification problem based on multidimensional coding schemes?",
        "Is it possible to train a one-size-fits-all model for all codes using a single combination of features?",
        "b) Are certain features better suited for codes with sparse positive examples?",
        "2 Machine Learning Experiments To optimize the initial machine learning model, we systematically ran multiple experiments using a gold standard corpus of emails from a free/libre/open-source software (FLOSS) development project coded for leadership behaviors (Misiolek et al., 2012).",
        "The coding scheme contained six dimensions: 1) social/relationship, 2) task process, 3) task substance, 4) dual process and substance, 5) change behaviors, and 6) networking.",
        "The number of codes for each dimension ranged from 1 to 14.",
        "There were a total of 35 codes in the coding scheme.",
        "Each sentence could be assigned more than one code.",
        "Framing the problem as a multi-label classification task, we trained a binary classification model for each code using support vector machine (SVM) with ten-fold cross-validation.",
        "This gold standard corpus consisted of 3,728 hand-coded sentences from 408 email messages.",
        "For the active learning setup, we tune the initial ML model for high recall since having the annotators pick out positive examples that have been incorrectly classified by the model is preferable to missing machine-annotated positive examples to be presented to human annotators for verification (Liew, McCracken, & Crowston, 2014).",
        "Therefore, the initial ML model with low precision is acceptable.",
        "Category Features Content Unigram, bigram, pruning, tagging, lowercase, stop-words, stemming, part-of-speech (POS) tags Syntactic Token count Orthographic Capitalization of first letter of a word, capitalization of entire word Word list Subjectivity words Semantic Role of sender (software developer or not) Table 1.",
        "Features for ML model.",
        "As shown in Table 1, we have selected general candidate features that have proven to work well across various text classification tasks, as well as one semantic feature specific to the context of FLOSS development projects.",
        "For content features, techniques that we have incorporated to reduce the feature space include pruning, substituting certain tokens with more generic tags, converting all tokens to lowercase, excluding stopwords, and stemming.",
        "Using the wrapper approach (Kohavi & John, 1997), the same classifier is used to test the prediction performance of various feature combinations listed in Table 1.",

        "3 Results and Discussion We ran 343 experiments with different combinations of the 13 features in Table 1.",
        "We first compare the performance of the best one-size-fits-all initial machine learning model that produces the highest recall using a single combination of features for all codes (SINGLE) with an ?ensemble?",
        "model that uses different combinations of features to produce the highest recall for each code (MULTIPLE).",
        "The SINGLE model combines content (unigram + bigram + POS tags + lowercase + stopwords) with syntactic, orthographic, and semantic features.",
        "None of the best feature combination for each code in the MULTIPLE model coincides with the feature combination in the SINGLE model.",
        "For example, the best feature combination for code ?Phatics/Salutations?",
        "consists of only 2 out of the 13 features (unigram + bigram).",
        "The best feature combination for each code in the MULTIPLE model varies with only some regularity noted in a few codes within the Dual and Substance dimensions.",
        "However, these patterns are not consistent across all codes in a single dimension indicating that the pertinent linguistic features for codes belonging to the same dimension may differ despite their conceptual similarities, and even fitting an optimal model for all codes within a single dimension may prove to be difficult especially when the distribution of codes is uneven, and positive examples for certain codes are sparse.",
        "There are also no consistent feature patterns observed from the codes with sparse positive examples in the MULTIPLE model.",

        "Recall and precision for each code (sorted by gold frequency) The comparison between the two models in Table 2 further demonstrates that the MULTIPLE model outperforms the SINGLE model both in the overall mean recall of all 35 codes, as well as the mean recall for each dimension.",
        "Figure 1 (codes grouped by dimensions) illustrates that the feature combination on the SINGLE model is ill-suited for the Process codes, and half the Dual Process and Substance codes.",
        "Recall for each code for the SINGLE model are mostly below or at par with the recall for each code in the MULTIPLE model.",
        "Thus, creating a one-size-fits-all initial model may not be optimal when training data is limited.",
        "Figure 2 (codes sorted based on gold frequency as shown beside the code names in the x-axis) exhibits that the SINGLE model is able to achieve similar recall to the MULTIPLE model for codes with over 100 positive examples in the training data.",
        "Precision for these codes are also higher compared to codes with sparse positive examples.",
        "This finding is promising because it implies that creating a one-size-fits-all initial ML model may be possible even for a multidimensional coding scheme if there are more than 100 positive examples for each code.",
        "4 Conclusion and Future Work We conclude that creating an optimal initial one-size-fits-all ML model for all codes in a multidimensional coding scheme using only a single feature combination is not possible when codes with sparse positive examples are present, and training data is limited, which may be common in real world content analysis projects in social science research.",
        "However, our findings also show that the potential of using a one-size-fits-all model increases when the size of positive examples for each code in the gold standard corpus are above 100.",
        "For social scientists who may not possess the technical skills needed for feature selection to optimize the initial ML model, this discovery confirms that we can create a ?canned?",
        "model using a single combination of features that would work well in text classification for a wide range of codes with the condition that researchers must be able to provide sufficient positive examples above a certain threshold to train the initial model.",
        "This would make the application of machine learning for qualitative content analysis more accessible to social scientists.",
        "The initial ML model with low precision means that the model is over-predicting.",
        "As a result, human annotators will have to correct more false positives in the machine annotations.",
        "For future work, we plan to experiment with different sampling strategies to pick the most ?prof- itable?",
        "machine annotations to be corrected by human annotators.",
        "We will also work on designing an interactive and adaptive user interface to promote greater understanding of machine learning outputs for our target users.",
