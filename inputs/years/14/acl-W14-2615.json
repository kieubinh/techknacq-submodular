        "Nowadays, Internet and social media generate a huge amount of textual information.",
        "It is increasingly important to develop methods of text processing such as text classification.",
        "Text classification is very important for such problems as automatic opining mining (sentiment analy-sis) and topic categorization of different articles from newspapers and Internet.",
        "Text classification can be considered to be a part of natural language understanding, where there is a set of predefined categories and the task is to automatically assign new documents to one of these categories.",
        "The method of text preprocessing and text representation influences the results that are obtained even with the same classification algorithms.",
        "The most popular model for text classification is vector space model.",
        "In this case text categorization may be considered as a machine learning problem.",
        "Complexity of text categorization with vector space model is compounded by the need to extract the numerical data from text information before applying machine learning methods.",
        "Therefore text categorization consists of two parts: text preprocessing and classification using obtained numerical data.",
        "All text preprocessing methods are based on the idea that the category of the document depends on the words or phrases from this document.",
        "The simplest approach is to take each word of the document as a binary coordinate and the dimension of the feature space will be the number of words in our dictionary.",
        "There exist more advanced approaches for text preprocessing to overcome this problem such as TF-IDF (Salton and Buckley, 1988) and ConfWeight methods (Soucy and Mineau, 2005).",
        "A novel term weighting method (Gasa- nova et al., 2013) is also considered, which has 84 some similarities with the ConfWeight method, but has improved computational efficiency.",
        "It is important to notice that we use no morphological or stop-word filtering before text preprocessing.",
        "It means that the text preprocessing can be performed without expert or linguistic knowledge and that the text preprocessing is language-independent.",
        "In this paper we have used k-nearest neighbors algorithm, Bayes Classifier, support vector machine (SVM) generated and optimized with COBRA (Co-Operation of Biology Related Al-gorithms) which has been proposed by Akhmedova and Semenkin (2013), Rocchio Classifier or Nearest Centroid Algorithm (Roc- chio, 1971) and Neural Network as classification methods.",

        "Section 3 presents text preprocessing methods.",
        "In Section 4 we describe the classification algorithms which we have used to compare different text preprocessing techniques.",

        "It implicitly does feature selection since all frequent words have zero weights.",
