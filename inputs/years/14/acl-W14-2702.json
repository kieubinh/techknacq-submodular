        "Researchers are increasingly using social media analysis to complement traditional survey methods in areas such as public health (Dredze, 2012), politics (O?Connor et al., 2010), and marketing (Gopinath et al., 2014).",
        "It is generally accepted that social media users are not a representative sample of the population (e.g., urban and minority populations tend to be overrepresented on Twitter (Mislove et al., 2011)).",
        "Nevertheless, few researchers have attempted to adjust for this bias.",
        "(Gayo-Avello (2011) is an exception.)",
        "This can in part be explained by the difficulty of obtaining demographic information of social media users ?",
        "while gender can sometimes be inferred from the user's name, other attributes such as age and race/ethnicity are more difficult to deduce.",
        "This problem of user attribute prediction is thus critical to such applications of social media analysis.",
        "A common approach to user attribute prediction is supervised classification ?",
        "from a training set of annotated users, a model is fit to predict user attributes from the content of their writings and their social connections (Argamon et al., 2005; Schler et al., 2006; Rao et al., 2010; Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011; Burger et al., 2011; Rao et al., 2011; Al Zamal et al., 2012).",
        "Because collecting human annotations is costly and error-prone, labeled data are often collected serendipitously; for example, Al Zamal et al. (2012) collect age annotations by searching for tweets with phrases such as ?Happy 21st birthday to me?",
        "; Pennacchiotti and Popescu (2011) collect race annotations by searching for profiles with explicit self identification (e.g., ?I am a black lawyer from Sacramento.?).",
        "While convenient, such an approach likely suffer from selection bias (Liu and Ruths, 2013).",
        "In this paper, we propose fitting classification models on population-level data, then applying them to predict user attributes.",
        "Specifically, we fit regression models to predict the race distribution of 100 U.S. counties (based on Census data) from geolocated Twitter messages.",
        "We then extend this learned model to predict user-level attributes.",
        "This lightly supervised approach reduces the need for human annotation, which is important not only because of the reduction of human effort, but also because many other attributes may be difficult even for humans to annotate at the user-level (e.g., health status, political orientation).",
        "We investigate this new approach through the following three research questions: RQ1.",
        "Can models trained on county statistics be used to infer user attributes?",
        "We find that a classifier trained on county statis-7 tics can make accurate predictions at the user level.",
        "Accuracy is slightly lower (by less than 1%) than a fully supervised approach using logistic regression trained on hundreds of labeled instances.",
        "RQ2.",
        "How do models trained on county data differ from those using standard supervised methods?",
        "We analyze the highly-weighted features of competing models, and find that while both models discern lexical differences (e.g., slang, word choice), the county-based model also learns geographical correlates of race (e.g., city, state).",
        "RQ3.",
        "What bias does serendipitously labeled data introduce?",
        "By comparing training datasets collected uniformly at random with those collected by searching for certain key-words, we find that the search approach produces a very biased class distribution.",
        "Addi-tionally, the classifier trained on such biased data tends to overweight features matching the original search keywords.",
        "2 Related Work Predicting attributes of social media users is a growing area of interest, with recent work focusing on age (Schler et al., 2006; Rosenthal and McKeown, 2011; Nguyen et al., 2011; Al Zamal et al., 2012), sex (Rao et al., 2010; Burger et al., 2011; Liu and Ruths, 2013), race/ethnicity (Pen- nacchiotti and Popescu, 2011; Rao et al., 2011), and personality (Argamon et al., 2005; Schwartz et al., 2013b).",
        "Other work predicts demographics from web browsing histories (Goel et al., 2012).",
        "The majority of these approaches rely on hand-annotated training data, require explicit self-identification by the user, or are limited to very coarse attribute values (e.g., above or below 25- years-old).",
        "Pennacchiotti and Popescu (2011) train a supervised classifier to predict whether a Twitter user is African-American or not based on linguistic and social features.",
        "To construct a labeled training set, they collect 6,000 Twitter accounts in which the user description matches phrases like ?I am a 20 year old African-American.?",
        "In our experiments below, we demonstrate how such serendipitously labeled data can introduce selection bias in the estimate of classification accuracy.",
        "Their final classifier obtains a 65.5% F1 measure on this binary classification task (compared with the 76.5% F1 we report below for a different dataset labeled with four race categories).",
        "A related lightly supervised approach includes Chang et al. (2010), who infer user-level ethnicity using name/ethnicity distributions provided by the Census; however, that approach uses evidence from first and last names, which are often not available, and thus are more appropriate for population-level estimates.",
        "Rao et al. (2011) extend this approach to also include evidence from other linguistic features to infer gender and ethnicity of Facebook users; they evaluate on the fine-grained ethnicity classes of Nigeria and use very limited training data.",
        "Viewed as a way to make individual inferences from aggregate data, our approach is related to ecological inference (King, 1997); however, here we have the advantage of user-level observations (linguistic data), which are typically absent in ecological inference settings.",
        "There have been several studies predicting population-level statistics from social media.",
        "Eisenstein et al. (2011) use geolocated tweets to predict zip-code statistics of race/ethnicity, in-come, and other variables using Census data; Schwartz et al. (2013b) and Culotta (2014) similarly predict county health statistics from Twitter.",
        "However, none of this prior work attempts to predict or evaluate at the user level.",
        "Schwartz et al. (2013a) collect Facebook profiles labeled with personality type, gender, and age by administering a survey of users embedded in a personality test application.",
        "While this approach was able to collect over 75K labeled profiles, it can be difficult to reproduce, and is also challenging to update over time without re-administering the survey.",
        "Compared to this related work, our core contribution is to propose and evaluate a classifier trained only on county statistics to estimate the race of a Twitter user.",
        "The resulting accuracy is competitive with a fully supervised baseline as well as with prior work.",
        "By avoiding the use of labeled data, the method is simple to train and easier to update as linguistic patterns evolve over time.",
        "3 Methods Our approach to user attribute prediction is as fol-lows: First, we collect population-level statistics, for example the racial makeup of a county.",
        "Sec-8 ond, we collect a sample of tweets from the same population areas and distill them into one feature vector per location.",
        "Third, we fit a regression model to predict the population-level statistics from the linguistic feature vector.",
        "Finally, we adapt the regression coefficients to predict the attributes of individual Twitter user.",
        "Below, we describe the data, the regression and classification models, and the experimental setup.",
        "3.1 Data We collect three types of data: (1) Census data, listing the racial makeup of U.S.",
        "Counties; (2) geolocated Twitter data from each county; (3) a validation set of Twitter users manually annotated with race, for evaluation purposes.",
        "3.1.1 Census Data The U.S. Census produces annual estimates of the race and Hispanic origin proportions for each county in the United States.",
        "These estimates are derived using the most recent decennial census and estimates of population changes (deaths, birth, mi-gration) since that census.",
        "The census questionnaire allows respondents to select one or more of 6 racial categories: White, Black or African Ameri-can, American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, or Other.",
        "Additionally, each respondent is asked whether they consider themselves to be of His-panic, Latino, or Spanish origin (ethnicity).",
        "Since respondents may select multiple races in addition to ethnicity, the Census reports many different combinations of results.",
        "While race/ethnicity is indeed a complex is-sue, for the purposes of this study we simplify by considering only four categories: Asian, Black, Latino, White.",
        "(For simplicity, we ignore the Cen-sus?",
        "distinction between race and ethnicity; due to small proportions, we also omit Other, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander.)",
        "For the three categories other than Latino, we collect the proportion of each county for that race, possibly in combinations with others.",
        "For example, the percentage of Asians in a county corresponds to the Census cat-egory: ?NHAAC: Not Hispanic, Asian alone or in combination.?",
        "The Latino proportion corresponds to the ?H?",
        "category, indicating the percentage of a county identifying themselves as of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin (our terminology again ignores the distinction between the terms ?Latino?",
        "and ?Hispanic?).",
        "We use the 2012 estimates for this study.",
        "1 We collect the proportion of residents from each of these four categories for the 100 most populous counties in the U.S. 3.1.2 Twitter County Data For each of the 100 most populous counties in the U.S., we identify its geographical coordinates (from the U.S. Census), and construct a geographical Twitter query (bounding box) consisting of a 50 square mile area centered at the county coordinates.",
        "This approximation introduces a very small amount of noise ?",
        "less than .02% of tweets come from areas of overlapping bounding boxes.",
        "2 We submit each of these 100 queries in turn from December 5, 2012 to November 14, 2013.",
        "These geographical queries return tweets that carry geographical coordinates, typically those sent from mobile devices with this preference enabled.",
        "3 This resulted in 5.7M tweets from 839K unique users.",
        "3.1.3 Validation Data Uniform Data: For validation purposes, we categorized 770 Twitter profiles into one of four categories (Asian, Black, Latino, White).",
        "These were collected as follows: First, we used the Twitter Streaming API to obtain a random sample of users, filtered to the United States (using time zone and the place country code from the pro-file).",
        "From six days?",
        "worth of data (December 6-12, 2013), we sampled 1,000 profiles at random and categorized them by analyzing the pro-file, tweets, and profile image for each user.",
        "Those for which race could not be determined were discarded (230/1,000; 23%).",
        "4 The category frequency is Asian (22), Black (263), Latino (158), White (327).",
        "To estimate inter-annotator agree-ment, a second annotator sampled and categorized 120 users.",
        "Among users for which both annotators selected one of the four categories, 74/76 labels agreed (97%).",
        "There was some disagreement over when the category could be determined: for 1 http://www.census.gov/popest/ data/counties/asrh/2012/files/ CC-EST2012-ALLDATA.csv 2 The Census also publishes polygon data for each county, which could be used to remove this small source of noise.",
        "3 Only considering geolocated tweets introduces some bias into the types of tweets observed.",
        "However, we compared the unigram frequency vectors from geolocated tweets with a sample of non-geolocated tweets and found a strong correlation (0.93).",
        "4 This introduces some bias towards accounts with identifiable race; we leave an investigation of this for future work.",
        "9 21/120 labels (17.5%), one annotator indicated the category could not be determined, while the other selected a category.",
        "For each user, we collected their 200 most recent tweets using the Twitter API.",
        "We refer to this as the Uniform dataset.",
        "Search Data: It is common in prior work to search for keywords indicating user attributes, rather than sampling uniformly at random and then labeling (Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011; Al Zamal et al., 2012).",
        "This is typically done for con-venience; a large number of annotations can be collected with little or no manual annotation.",
        "We hypothesize that this approach results in a biased sample of users, since it is restricted to those with a predetermined set of keywords.",
        "This bias may affect the estimate of the generalization accuracy of the resulting classifier.",
        "To investigate this, we used the Twitter Search API to collect profiles containing a predefined set of keywords indicating race.",
        "Examples include the terms ?African?, ?Black?, ?Hispanic?, ?Latin?, ?Latino?, ?Spanish?, ?Chinese?, ?Italian?, ?Irish.?",
        "Profiles containing such words in the description field were collected.",
        "These were further filtered in an attempt to remove businesses (e.g., Chinese restaurants) by excluding profiles with the keywords in the name field as well as those whose name fields did not contain terms on the Census?",
        "list of common first and last names.",
        "Remaining profiles were then manually reviewed for accuracy.",
        "This resulted in 2,000 annotated users with the following distribution: Asian (377), Black (373), Latino (356), White (894).",
        "For each user, we collected their 200 most recent tweets using the Twitter API.",
        "We refer to this as the Search dataset.",
        "Table 1 compares the race distribution for each of the two datasets.",
        "It is apparent that the Search dataset oversamples Asian users and undersam-ples Black users as compared to the Uniform dataset.",
        "This may in part due to the greater number of keywords used to identify Asian users (e.g., Chinese, Japanese, Korean).",
        "This highlights the difficulty of obtaining a representative sample of Twitter users with the search approach, since the inclusion of a single keyword can result in a very different distribution of labels.",
        "3.2 Models 3.2.1 County Regression We build a text regression model to predict the racial makeup of a county (from the Census data) Uniform Search Asian 3% 19% Black 34% 19% Latino 21% 18% White 42% 44% Table 1: Percentage of users by race in the two validation datasets.",

        "Thus, two sample feature values are (china, 0.1) and (desc china, 0.05), indicating that 10% of users in the county wrote a tweet containing the unigram china, and 5% have the word china in their profile description.",
        "We ignore mentions and collapse URLs (replacing them with the token ?http?",
        "), but retain hashtags.",
        "We fit four separate ridge regression models, one per race.",
