        "4 In this work, we investigate whether enrollment in the Vine program results in changes in the linguistic style used in reviews.",
        "We investigate this by looking at reviews by individuals before and after enrollment in the program.",

        "Our approach offers a framework for analyzing text to detect these changes.",

        "Product Reviews, Product Sampling, Status and Stylometry.",
        "Product Reviews Product reviews have received considerable attention in multiple disciplines including Marketing, Computer Science and Information Science.",
        "Research has addressed questions such as the influence of product reviews on product sales and on brands (Gopinath et al. (2014); Chevalier and Mayzlin (2006)), detection of deceptive reviews (Ott et al., 2011) and sentiment summarization (Titov and McDonald, 2008).",

        "Product Sampling Here, consumers receive products for free ?",
        "as a marketing tactic.",
        "This is also a well-studied phenomenon.",
        "Research in this area has indicated that consumers value free products (Shampanier et al. (2007); Palmeira and Srivastava (2013)); that product sampling affects brand sales (Bawa and Shoemaker, 2004) and that sampling influences consumer behavior (Wadhwa et al., 2008).",
        "Status Research shows that status can influence writing style.",
        "Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2012) study discussions among Wikipedia editors and transcripts of oral arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court and show how variations in linguistic style can provide information about power differences within social groups.",

        "Our work draws from each of these research areas and in turn hopes to make a contribution to each in return.",
        "Our primary objective is to establish a framework to detect behavioral change due to a decision by a firm (in this case enrollment to the Vine program characterized by free products and Vine membership status) by analyzing product reviews.",
        "Further, we hope to understand the dimensions on which this behavior may have changed.",
        "Consequently, we pursue a novel stylometric task.",
        "This type of work is especially important when the traditional numerical measure (rating) suggests there is no difference in the review pre and post-enrollment (see Section 4).",
        "3 Data & Pre-processing Steps We gathered all reviews by the top 10,000 reviewers ranked by Amazon as of September, 2012.",
        "These rankings are partly driven by helpfulness and recency of reviews 5 .",
        "The data collected includes the review text, review title, rating as-signed, date posted, product URL, product price, whether the reviewed product was received for free via the Vine program (also referred to as 5 http://www.amazon.com/review/guidelines/top-reviewers.html/ ?Vine Review?",
        "), ?helpfulness?",
        "votes and badges received by the reviewer .",
        "We collected a total of 2,464,141 reviews of which 282,913 reviews were for products received for free via the Vine program.",
        "These reviews covered a total of 9,982 reviewers 6 of which 3,566 were members of the Vine program.",
        "Approximately half the reviews belonged to Vine members.",
        "We eliminated reviews that did not have a rating.",
        "We further excluded reviews where the review text was less than 20 words in length.",
        "We were left with 1,189,704 reviews by Vine members.",
        "The date of enrollment to the Vine program for each reviewer is not explicitly available.",
        "We infer the date of enrollment in the following manner.",
        "We sort in ascending order all the ?Vine Reviews?",
        "for each reviewer by posted date.",
        "We assume the earliest posted date for a ?Vine re-view?",
        "is the enrollment date.",
        "This is an important assumption, as potentially reviewers could have moved in and out of the program at varying points of time.",
        "Reviewers can be moved out of the program for reasons such as not posting a ?Vine Re-view?",
        "within 30 days of receipt of the product.",
        "In our data set we found 47,510 ?Vine Reviews?",
        "by 163 reviewers who were not actively on the Vine program 7 .",
        "We can view these reviewers as having been dropped from the Vine program.",
        "Given the small volume of this type of reviews and review-ers, our assumption on date of enrollment appears reasonable.",

        "One naive theory is that 6 During the crawling, ranks changed resulting in fewer than 10,000 reviewers in our data set.",
        "7 As these reviewers were not enrolled to Amazon's Vine Program as of September, 2012, they are excluded from our analysis.",
        "18 perhaps receiving products for free and receiving status badges will result in Vine members posting more positive reviews.",
        "Interestingly, the average rating for reviews by Vine members posted before enrollment is 4.22 and after enrollment is 4.21 and this difference is not statistically significant.",
        "In contrast, the length of reviews significantly increased from 251 words prior to enrollment to 306 words post-enrollment.",
        "Natural language techniques are the only option to further investigate possible effects of enrollment.",
        "Consequently we focus on the review text posted by Vine members.",
        "4.1 Approach Following Ashok et al. (2013) and Bergsma et al. (2012) we construct features that represent writing style from each review (discussed in more detail in the next section).",
        "We incorporate these features in a classification algorithm that attempts to classify each review as having been written pre or post-enrollment to the Vine program.",
        "We report whether the difference in accuracy for this classifier vs. a majority vote classification is statistically significant or not.",
        "In order to detect differences in style pre and post-enrollment, we need to address certain confounding factors ?",
        "Reviewer Specificity , Product Specificity and Time Specificity.",
        "Reviewer Specificity It may be possible that certain users post more reviews post-enrollment than pre-enrollment.",
        "Consequently the classifier may simply end up learning the differences in style between reviewers.",
        "To avoid this, we construct a balanced sample where we randomly select 25 reviews for each reviewer prior to and post-enrollment (see Table 2).",
        "This also sets our baseline accuracy at 50%.",
        "Product Specificity As the program started in 2007, the post-enrollment reviews are likely to predominantly contain products released in after 2007.",
        "This might result in the classifier simply learning the differences between products (say I Phone vs Palm).",
        "Given our focus on style, we do not use word tokens as such thus avoiding the use of product specific features.",
        "However, for some products, the product specific details may result in the use of specific syntactic structures.",
        "We assume this is not a significant contributor to the prediction performance.",
        "A post-hoc analysis of the top features supports this assumption.",
        "A second source of change in writing style could be due to simply whether the product was bought or received for free.",
        "We exclude ?Vine Reviews?",
        "8 to eliminate this confounding factor.",
        "Time Specificity A similar concern as Product Specificity exists for date references.",
        "By focusing on syntactic and semantic style, we avoid the use of time specific features.",
        "Another concern is that perhaps post enroll-ment, reviewers receive writing guidelines from Amazon.",
        "This does not appear to be the case, as the writing guidelines 9 appear to be for all mem-bers.We now turn to the extraction of style features.",

        "This allows us to investigate purely syntactic features from the text.",
        "Phrasal/ Clausal Nodes (PHR/CLSL) We also investigate features that incorporate phrasal or clausal nodes of the parse trees.",
        "Please see Table 5 and Table 6 for examples of these features.",
        "Parse Tree Measures (PTM) We construct a set of measures for each sentence based on the parse tree.",
        "These measures are maximum height of parse tree, maximum width of the parse tree and the number of sentences in each review.",
        "Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) We also apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003) to the production rules extracted from the Probabilistic Context Free Grammar.",
        "We use the topics generated as features in our prediction task.",
        "Our objective was to determine whether certain co-occurring production rules offered better classification accuracy.",
        "Our implementation includes hyper-parameter optimization via maximum likelihood.",
        "The number of topics is selected by maximizing the pairwise cosine distance amongst topics.",
        "We used the Stanford Parser (Klein and Man-ning, 2003) to parse each of the reviews and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) (Bird et al., 2009) to post process the results.",
        "4.2.3 Genre and Semantic Features Style Metrics (STYLE ) This includes three distinct types of metrics.",
        "Character Based This includes counts of uppercased letters, number of letters, number of spaces and number of vowels.",

        "both sub-ordinate and super-ordinate categories.",
        "The second (LIWC SUB CATEG.)",
