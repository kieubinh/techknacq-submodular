        "With the fast growth of the popularity of online social media, people nowadays are very used to sharing their thoughts and interacting with their friends on the Internet.",
        "Large online social network sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Flickr have attracted hundreds of millions of users.",
        "Among these online social media platforms, forums have always played an important role with its special characteristics.",
        "Unlike personal blogs, forums allow many users to engage in online conversations with a topic focus.",
        "Unlike Facebook, forums are usually open to public and users who post in forums do not need to reveal too much personal information.",
        "Unlike Wikipedia or Freebase, forums encourage users to exchange not only factual information but more importantly subjective opinions.",
        "All these characteristics make online forums a valuable source from which we can retrieve and summarize the general public's opinions about a given topic.",
        "This is especially important for businesses who want to find out how their products and services have been received and policy makers who are concerned about people's opinions on social issues.",
        "While the freedom with which users can post in online forums has promoted the popularity of online forums, it has also led to the diversity in post quality.",
        "There are posts which contribute positively to a discussion by offering relevant, serious and meaningful opinions, but there are also many posts which appear irrelevant, disrespectful or meaningless.",
        "These posts are uninformative, hard to consume and sometimes even destructive.",
        "Let us look at some examples.",
        "Table 1 shows two forum posts in response to a piece of news about GDP bonuses for senior civil servants in Singapore.",
        "We can see that User A's post is clearly written.",
        "User B's post, on the other hand, is hard to comprehend.",
        "We see broken sentences, many punctuation marks such as ???",
        "and colloquial expressions such as ?ha.?",
        "User B is not seriously contributing to the online discussion but rather trying to make a joke of the issue.",
        "Generally speaking, User B's post is less useful than User A's post in helping us understand the public's response to the news.",
        "Senior civil servants to get bumper GDP bonuses User A let us ensure this will be the LAST time they accord themselves ceiling salary scales and bonuses.",
        "i suspect MANY citizens are eagerly looking forward to the GE.",
        "User B Fever night, fever night, fe..ver.. Fever like to do it Got it??????",
        "Ha..ha..ha... Table 1: Two example online posts.",
        "In this work, we opt for a fully unsupervised approach to modeling this phenomenon in online discussions.",
        "Our solution is based on the observation that the writing styles of serious posts and unserious posts are different, and the writing styles are often characterized by the words used in the posts.",
        "Moreover, the same user usually exhibits 33 User Post User A Re: Creativity, Art in the eyes of beholder.",
        "your take?",
        "The difference is, the human can get tired or sick, and then it will affect his work, but the robot can work 24 hours a day 365 days a year and yet produce the same every time.",
        "Re: Diesel oil spill turns Manila Bay red, poses risk to health ST The question is, will this environmental hazard turn up on the shores of it neighbors?",
        "And maybe even affect Singapore waters?",
        "User B Re: Will PAP know who i vote in GE?",
        "Hey!",
        "Who are you???",
        "You make.",
        "ha..ha..ha.. he..he..he.. very angry lah Re: Gender discrimination must end for Singapore to flourish, says AWARE Hao nan bu gen nu dou Let you win lah ha..ha..ha.. Table 2: Sample posts of two example users.",
        "the same writing style in most of his posts.",
        "For example, Table 2 shows two example users, each with two sample posts.",
        "We can see that their writing styles are consistent in the two posts.",
        "If we treat each writing style as a latent factor associated with a word distribution, we can associate observed words with the underlying writing styles.",
        "However, not all words in a post are style-driven.",
        "Many words in forum posts are chosen based on the topic of the corresponding thread.",
        "Our model therefore jointly considers both topics and writing styles.",
        "We apply our topic-style model to a real online forum dataset from Singapore.",
        "By setting the number of styles to two, we clearly find that one writing style corresponds to the more serious posts while the other corresponds to posts that are not so serious.",
        "This topic-style model also automatically learns a meaningful slang lexicon.",
        "Moreover, we find that topics discovered by our topic-style model are more distinctive from each other than topics produced by standard LDA.",
        "Our contributions in this paper can be summarized as follows: 1) We propose a principled topic-style model to jointly model topics and writing styles at the same time in online forums.",
        "2) An extensive set of experiments shows that our model is effective in separating the more serious posts and unserious posts and identifying slang words.",
        "2 Related Work Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) has been shown to be useful for many applications.",
        "Many extensions of LDA have been designed for different tasks, which are not detailed here.",
        "Our model is also an extension of LDA.",
        "We introduce two types of word distributions, one representing topics and the other representing writing styles.",
        "We use switch variables to alternate between these two types of word distributions.",
        "We also assume an author-level distribution over writing styles.",
        "It is worth pointing out that although our model bears similarity to a number of other LDA extensions, our objectives are different from existing work.",
        "E.g., the author topic model (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004) also assumes an author-level distribution over topics, but the author-level distribution is meant to capture an author's topical interests.",
        "In contrast, our user-level distribution is over writing styles and is meant to identify serious versus unserious users.",
        "Similar to the models by Mei et al. (2007) and Paul et al. (2010) , we also use switch variables to alternate between different types of word distributions, but our goal is to identify words associated with writing styles instead of sentiment words or perspective words.",
        "Another body of related research is around studying text quality, formality and sarcasm.",
        "Pitler and Nenkova (2008) investigated different features for text readability judgement and empirically demonstrated that discourse relations are highly correlated with perceived readability.",
        "Brooke et al. (2010) applied Latent Semantic Analysis to determine the formality level of lexical items.",
        "Agichtein et al. (2008) presented a general classification framework incorporating community feedback to identify high quality content in social media.",
        "Davidov et al. (2010) proposed the first robust algorithm for recognition of sarcasm.",
        "Gonz?alez-Ib?a?nez et al. (2011) took a closer look at sarcasm in Twitter messages and found that automatic classification can be as good as human classification.",
        "All these studies mainly rely on supervised techniques and human annotation needs to be done, which is very time consuming.",
        "Our method is fully unsupervised, which can automatically uncover different styles and separate serious posts from unserious posts.",
        "Our work is also related to spam/spammer detection in social media, which has been studied over different platforms for a few years.",
        "Jindal and Liu (2008) first studied opinion spam in online reviews and proposed a classification method for opinion spam detection.",
        "Bhattarai et al. (2009) 34 investigated different content attributes of comment spam in the Blogsphere and built a detection system with good performance based on these attributes.",
        "Ding et al. (2013) proposed to utilize both content and social features to detect spams in online question answer website.",
        "Existing work on spam detection need annotated data to learn the spam features but our model does not as it is fully unsupervised.",
        "3 A Topic-Style Model Writing styles can be reflected in many different ways.",
        "Besides choices of words or expression-s, many other linguistic features such as sentence length, sentence complexity and use of punctuation marks may all be associated with one's writing style.",
        "In this work, however, we try to take an approach that does not rely on heavy linguistic analysis or feature engineering.",
        "Part of the reason is that we want our approach to be independent of language, culture or social norms so that it is robust and can be easily applied to any online forum.",
        "To this end, we represent a writing style simply as a distribution over words, much like a topic in LDA.",
        "We assume that there are S latent writing styles shared by all users contributing to a forum.",
        "Meanwhile, we also assume a different set of T latent topics.",
        "We mix writing styles and topics to explain the generation of words in forum posts.",
        "A key assumption we have is that the same user tends to maintain a consistent writing style, and therefore we associate each user with a multinomial distribution over our latent writing styles.",
        "This is similar to associating a document with a distribution over topics in LDA, where the assumption is that a single document tends to have focused topics.",
        "Another assumption of our model is that each word in a post is generated from either the background or a topic or a writing style, as determined by a binary switch variable.",

        "This evaluation is based on the assumption that if a method can separate serious and unserious posts very well, posts ranked at the top position should be unserious ones and those ranked near to the bottom should be serious ones.",
        "The results are shown in Table 7 where our method is denoted as TSM and the baseline method is denoted as EMO.",
        "In serious post retrieval, the baseline have a perfect performance and our method is competitive.",
        "We can see that EMO has a perfect performance in identifying serious posts.",
        "When posts are ranked in reverse order according to the number of emoticons they contain, the last 50 ones do not contain any emoticons.",
        "They can be regarded as a random sample of posts without emoticons.",
        "Compared with identifying serious posts, identifying unserious posts looks much more difficult.",
        "EMO's poor performance on this task tells us that emoticon is not a promising sign to detect unserious posts.",
        "However, the word style a post uses matters more, which also proves the value of our proposed model.",

        "For each user, 10 posts are sampled to be shown to the annotators.",
        "We mix these 100 users and ask two graduate students to do the annotations.",
        "The evaluation strategy is the same as that in Section 4.3.",
        "We choose a simple baseline which ranks users by the number of emoticons they use per post.",

        "4.5 Perplexity Perplexity is a widely used criterion in statistical natural language processing.",
        "It measures the predictive power of a model on unseen data, which is algebraically equivalent to the inverse of the geometric mean per-word likelihood.",
        "A lower perplexity means the test data, which is unseen in the training phase, can be generated by the model with a higher probability.",
        "So it also indicates that the model has a better generalization performance.",
        "In this experiment, we leave 10% data for testing and use the remaining 90% data for training.",

        "We can clearly see that the Average Divergence of TSM is substantially larger than that of LDA over different numbers of topics.",
        "This proves that in TSM, the learned topics are more distinct from each other.",
        "This is because LDA mixes these two kinds of words, which introduces noise into the learned topics and decreases their distinction between each other.",
        "But topic driven words and style driven words are well separated in TSM.",
