        "Self-disclosure, the act of revealing oneself to others, is an important social behavior that contributes positively to intimacy and social support from others.",
        "It is a natural behavior, and social scientists have carried out numerous quantitative analyses of it through manual tagging and survey questionnaires.",
        "Recently, the flood of data from online social networks (OSN) offers a practical way to observe and analyze self-disclosure behavior at an unprecedented scale.",
        "The challenge with such analysis is that OSN data come with no annotations, and it would be impossible to manually annotate the data for a quantitative analysis of self-disclosure.",
        "As a solution, we propose a semi-supervised machine learning approach, using a variant of latent Dirichlet allocation for automatically classifying self-disclosure in a massive dataset of Twitter conversations.",
        "For measuring the accuracy of our model, we manually annotate a small subset of our dataset, and we show that our model shows significantly higher accuracy and F-measure than various other methods.",
        "With the results our model, we uncover a positive and significant relationship between self-disclosure and online conversation frequency over time."

        "Self-disclosure is an important and pervasive social behavior.",
        "People disclose personal information about themselves to improve and maintain relationships (Jourard, 1971; Joinson and Paine, 2007).",
        "For example, when two people meet for the first time, they disclose their names and interests.",
        "One positive outcome of self-disclosure is social support from others (Wills, 1985; Derlega et al., 1993), shown also in online social networks (OSN) such as Twitter (Kim et al., 2012).",
        "Receiving social support would then lead the user to be more active on OSN (Steinfield et al., 2008; Trepte and Reinecke, 2013).",
        "In this paper, we seek to understand this important social behavior using a large-scale Twitter conversation data, automatically classifying the level of self-disclosure using machine learning and correlating the patterns with subsequent OSN usage.",
        "Twitter conversation data, explained in more detail in section 4.1, enable a significantly larger scale study of naturally-occurring self-disclosure behavior, compared to traditional social science studies.",
        "One challenge of such large scale study, though, remains in the lack of labeled ground-truth data of self-disclosure level.",
        "That is, naturally-occurring Twitter conversations do not come tagged with the level of self-disclosure in each conversation.",
        "To overcome that challenge, we propose a semi-supervised machine learning approach using probabilistic topic modeling.",
        "Our self-disclosure topic model (SDTM) assumes that self-disclosure behavior can be modeled using a combination of simple linguistic features (e.g., pronouns) with automatically discovered semantic themes (i.e., topics).",
        "For instance, an utterance ?I am finally through with this disastrous relation-ship?",
        "uses a first-person pronoun and contains a topic about personal relationships.",
        "In comparison with various other models, SDTM shows the highest accuracy, and the resulting self-disclosure patterns of the users are correlated significantly with their future OSN usage.",
        "Our contributions to the research community include the following: ?",
        "We present a topic model that explicitly includes the level of self-disclosure in a conversation using linguistic features and the latent semantic topics (Sec.",
        "3).",
        "42 ?",
        "We collect a large dataset of Twitter conversations over three years and annotate a small subset with self-disclosure level (Sec.",

        "We compare the classification accuracy of SDTM with other models and show that it performs the best (Sec.",
        "5).",
        "?",
        "We correlate the self-disclosure patterns of users and their subsequent OSN usage to show that there is a positive and significant relationship (Sec.",
        "6).",
        "2 Background In this section, we review literature on the relevant aspects of self-disclosure.",
        "Self-disclosure (SD) level: To quantitatively analyze self-disclosure, researchers categorize self-disclosure language into three levels: G (gen- eral) for no disclosure, M for medium disclosure, and H for high disclosure (Vondracek and Von-dracek, 1971; Barak and Gluck-Ofri, 2007).",
        "Utterances that contain general (non-sensitive) information about the self or someone close (e.g., a family member) are categorized as M. Examples are personal events, past history, or future plans.",
        "Utterances about age, occupation and hobbies are also included.",
        "Utterances that contain sensitive information about the self or someone close are categorized as H. Sensitive information includes personal characteristics, problematic behaviors, physical appearance and wishful ideas.",
        "Generally, these are thoughts and information that one would generally keep as secrets to himself.",
        "All other utterances, those that do not contain information about the self or someone close are categorized as G. Examples include gossip about celebrities or factual discourse about current events.",
        "Classifying self-disclosure level: Prior work on quantitatively analyzing self-disclosure has relied on user surveys (Trepte and Reinecke, 2013; Ledbetter et al., 2011) or human annotation (Barak and Gluck-Ofri, 2007).",
        "These methods consume much time and effort, so they are not suitable for large-scale studies.",
        "In prior work closest to ours, Bak et al. (2012) showed that a topic model can be used to identify self-disclosure, but that work applies a two-step process in which a basic topic model is first applied to find the topics, and then the topics are post-processed for binary classification of self-disclosure.",
        "We improve upon this work by applying a single unified model of topics and ??",

        "Self-disclosure and online social network: According to social psychology, when someone discloses about himself, he will receive social support from those around him (Wills, 1985; Derlega et al., 1993), and this pattern of self-disclosure and social support was verified for Twitter conversation data (Kim et al., 2012).",
        "Social support is a major motivation for active usage of social networks services (SNS), and there are findings that show self-disclosure on SNS has a positive longitudinal effect on future SNS use (Trepte and Reinecke, 2013; Ledbetter et al., 2011).",
        "While these previous studies focused on small, qualitative studies, we conduct a large-scale, machine learning driven study to approach the question of self-disclosure behavior and SNS use.",
        "3 Self-Disclosure Topic Model This section describes our model, the self-disclosure topic model (SDTM), for classifying self-disclosure level and discovering topics for each self-disclosure level.",
        "3.1 Model We make two important assumptions based on our observations of the data.",
        "First, first-person pronouns (I, my, me) are good indicators for medium level of self-disclosure.",
        "For example, phrases such as ?I live?",
        "or ?My age is?",
        "occur in utterances that reveal personal information.",
        "Second, there are topics that occur much more frequently at a particular SD level.",

        "(Trepte and Reinecke, 2013) showed that frequent or high-level of self-disclosure in online social networks (OSN) contributes positively to OSN usage, and vice versa.",
        "They showed this through an online survey with 46 Facebook and StudiVZ users.",
        "With SDTM, we can automatically classify self-disclosure level of a large number of conversations, so we investigate whether there is a similar relationship between self-disclosure in conversations and subsequent frequency of conversations with the same partner on Twitter.",
        "More specifically, we ask the following two questions: 1.",
        "If a dyad displays high SD level in their conversations at a particular time period, would they have more frequent conversations subse-quently?",
        "2.",
        "If a dyad shows high conversation frequency at a particular time period, would they display higher SD in their subsequent conver-sations?",
        "6.1 Experiment Setup We first run SDTM with all of our Twitter conversation data with 150; 120; 120 topics for SDTM K G ,K M and K H respectively.",
        "The hyper-parameters are the same as in section 5.",
        "To handle a large dataset, we employ a distributed algorithm (Newman et al., 2009).",
        "Table 5 shows some of the topics that were prominent in each SD level by KL-divergence.",
        "As expected, G level includes general topics such as food, celebrity, soccer and IT devices, M level includes personal communication and birthday, and finally, H level includes sickness and profanity.",
        "For comparing conversation frequencies over time, we divided the conversations into two sets for each dyad.",
        "For the initial period, we include conversations from the dyad's first conversation to 60 days later.",
        "And for the subsequent period, we include conversations during the subsequent 30 days.",
        "We compute proportions of conversation for each SD level for each dyad in the initial and subsequent periods.",
        "Also, we define a new mea-surement, SD level score for a dyad in the period, which is a weighted sum of each conversation with SD levels mapped to 1, 2, and 3, for the levels G, M, and H, respectively.",
        "6.2 Does self-disclosure lead to more frequent conversations?",
        "We investigate the effect of the level self-disclosure on long-term use of OSN.",
        "We run linear regression with the intial SD level score as 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0Initial SD level 1.0 0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 # C onv ersa ctio n ch ang es p rop orti on o ver tim e Figure 3: Relationship between initial SD level and conversation frequency changes over time.",
        "The solid line is the linear regression line, and the coefficient is 0.118 with p < 0.001, which shows a significant positive relationship.",

        "For M and H levels, there is significant positive relationship (p < 0.0001), but for the G level, there is not (p > 0.1).",
        "the independent variable, and the rate of change in conversation frequency between initial period and subsequent period as the dependent variable.",
        "The result of regression is that the independent variable's coefficient is 0.118 with a low p-value (p < 0.001).",
        "Figure 3 shows the scatter plot with the regression line, and we can see that the slope of regression line is positive.",
        "We also investigate the importance of each SD level for changes in conversation frequency.",
        "We run linear regression with initial proportions of each SD level as the independent variable, and the same dependent variable as above.",
        "As table 6 shows, there is no significant relationship between the initial proportion of the G level and the changes in conversation frequency (p > 0.1).",
        "But for the M and H levels, the initial proportions show positive and significant relationships with the subsequent changes to the conversation frequency (p < 0.0001).",
        "These results show that M and H levels are correlated with changes to the frequency of conversation.",

        "6.3 Does high frequency of conversation lead to more self-disclosure?",
        "Now we investigate whether the initial conversation frequency is correlated with the SD level in the subsequent period.",
        "We run linear regression with the initial conversation frequency as the independent variable, and SD level in the subsequent period as the dependent variable.",
        "The regression coefficient is 0.0016 with low p-value (p < 0.0001).",
        "Figure 4 shows the scatter plot.",
        "We can see that the slope of the regression line is positive.",
        "This result supports previous results in social psychology (Leung, 2002) that frequency of instant chat program ICQ and session time were correlated to depth of SD in message.",
        "7 Conclusion and Future Work In this paper, we have presented the self-disclosure topic model (SDTM) for discovering topics and classifying SD levels from Twitter conversation data.",
        "We devised a set of effective seed words and trigrams, mined from a dataset of secrets.",
        "We also annotated Twitter conversations to make a ground-truth dataset for SD level.",
        "With annotated data, we showed that SDTM outperforms previous methods in classification accuracy and F-measure.",
        "We also analyzed the relationship between SD level and conversation frequency over time.",
        "We found that there is a positive correlation between initial SD level and subsequent conversation frequency.",
        "Also, dyads show higher level of SD if they initially display high conversation frequency.",
        "These results support previous results in social psychology research with more robust results from a large-scale dataset, and show importance of looking at SD behavior in OSN.",
        "There are several future directions for this research.",
        "First, we can improve our modeling for higher accuracy and better interpretability.",
        "For instance, SDTM only considers first-person pronouns and topics.",
        "Naturally, there are patterns that can be identified by humans but not captured by pronouns and topics.",
        "Second, the number of topics for each level is varied, and so we can explore nonparametric topic models (Teh et al., 2006) which infer the number of topics from the data.",
        "Third, we can look at the relationship between self-disclosure behavior and general online social network usage beyond conversations.",
