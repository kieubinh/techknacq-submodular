        "Twitter has become one of the most widely used social media platforms, with users (as of March 2013) posting approximately 400 million tweets per day (Wickre, 2013).",
        "This public data serves as a potential source for a multitude of information needs, but the sheer volume of tweets is a bottleneck in identifying relevant content (Becker et al., 2011).",
        "De Choudhury et al. (2012) showed that the user type of a Twitter account is an important indicator in sifting through Twitter data.",
        "The knowledge of a tweet's origin has potential implications on the nature of the content to an end user (e.g., credibility, location, etc).",
        "Also, certain types of events are more likely to be reported by individual persons (e.g., local events) whereas organizations generally report events that are of interest to a wider audience.",
        "The first part of our research focuses on user type classification in Twitter.",
        "De Choudhury et al. (2012) addressed this problem by examining meta-information derived from the Twitter API.",
        "In contrast, the goal of our work is to classify tweets, based solely on their textual content.",
        "We highlight several reasons why this can be advantageous.",
        "One reason is that people frequently share content from other sources, but the shared content often appears in their Twitter timeline as if it was their own.",
        "Consequently, a tweet that was posted by an individual may have originated from an organization.",
        "Moreover, meta-information can sometimes be infeasible to obtain given the rate limits 1 and there are times when profile information for a user account is unavailable or ambiguous (e.g., users often leave their profile information blank or write vague entries).",
        "Therefore, we believe there is value in being able to infer the type of user who authored a tweet based solely on its textual content.",
        "Potentially, our methods for user type classification based on textual content can also be combined with methods that examine user profile data or other meta-data, since they are complementary sources of information.",
        "In this paper, we present a classifier that tries to determine whether a tweet originated from an organization or a person using a rich, linguistically-motivated feature set.",
        "We design features to recognize linguistic characteristics, including sentiment and emotion expressions, informal language use, tweet style, and similarity with news headlines.",
        "We evaluate our classifier on both English and Spanish Twitter data and find that the classifier achieves an 89% F 1 -score for identifying tweets that originate from organizations in English and a 1 https://dev.twitter.com/docs/rate-limiting/1.1/limits 98 87% F 1 -score for Spanish.",
        "The second contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that user type classification can improve event recognition in Twitter.",
        "We conduct a study of event recognition for civil unrest events and disease outbreak events.",
        "Based on statistics from manually annotated tweets, we found that organization-tweets are much more likely to mention these events than person-tweets.",
        "We then investigate several approaches to incorporate user type information into event recognition models.",
        "Our best results are produced by training separate event classifiers for tweets from different user types.",
        "We show that user type information consistently improves event recognition performance for both civil unrest events and disease outbreak events and for both English and Spanish tweets.",
        "2 Related Work Our work is most closely related to that of De Choudhury et al. (2012), which proposed methods to classify Twitter users into three categories: 1) Journalists/media bloggers, 2) Organizations and 3) Ordinary Individuals.",
        "They employed features derived from social network structure, user activity and users?",
        "social interaction behaviors, and named entities and historical topic distributions in tweets.",
        "In contrast, our work classifies isolated tweets into two different user types, based on their textual content.",
        "Consequently, our work can produce different user type labels for different tweets by the same user, which can help identify shared content not authored by the user.",
        "Another body of related work tries to classify Twitter users along other dimensions such as ethnicity and political orientation (Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011; Cohen and Ruths, 2013).",
        "Gender inference in Twitter has also garnered interest in the recent past (Ciot et al., 2013; Liu and Ruths, 2013; Fink et al., 2012).",
        "Researchers have also focused on user behaviors showcased in Twitter including the types of messages posted (Naaman et al., 2010), social connections (Wu et al., 2011), user responses to events (Popescu and Pennac-chiotti, 2011) and behaviors related to demographics (Volkova et al., 2013; Mislove et al., 2011; Rao et al., 2010).",
        "Event recognition is another area that continues to attract a lot of interest in social media.",
        "Previous work has investigated event identification and extraction (Jackoway et al., 2011; Becker et al., 2009; Becker et al., 2010; Ritter et al., 2012), event discovery (Benson et al., 2011; Sakaki et al., 2010; Petrovi?c et al., 2010), tracking events over time (Kim et al., 2012; Sayyadi et al., 2009) and event retrieval over archived Twitter data (Metzler et al., 2012).",
        "While our work focuses on user type classification, we show that the user type of a tweet is an important piece of information that can be beneficial in event recognition models.",
        "3 Twitter User Types Twitter user types can be analyzed in different granularities and across different dimensions.",
        "We follow a high-level categorization of user types into organizations and individual persons.",
        "While we acknowledge the existence of other user types, such as automated bots, we focus only on the organization and individual person user types for our research.",

        "As shown in Figure 1, organization-tweets are often characterized by headline-like language usage, structured style, a lack of conversation with the audience (i.e., few reply-tweets), and hyperlinks to original articles.",
        "In contrast, person-tweets show significant language variability including shorthand terms, conversational behavior, slang and profanity, expressions of emotion, and an overall relaxed usage of language.",
        "99 3.1 Data Acquisition for User Types To create our data sets, we archived tweets (us- ing Twitter Streaming API) for six months, beginning February 1 st , 2013.",
        "We then used a language filter (Lui and Baldwin, 2012) to separate out the English and Spanish tweets.",
        "Also, in the data sets we created (see below), we removed du-plicates, retweets and any tweet with less than 5 words.",
        "Given that large-scale human annotation is expensive, we explored several heuristics to reliably compile a large gold standard collection of person- and organization-tweets.",
        "3.1.1 Acquiring Person-tweets To acquire person-tweets, we devised a person heuristic, focusing on the name and the profile description fields in each user account corresponding to a tweet.",
        "We first gathered lists of person names (first names and surnames), for both English and Spanish, using census data 2 and online resources 3 .",
        "We also compiled a list of common organization terms (e.g., agency, institute, com-pany, etc) in both English and Spanish.",
        "The person heuristic labels a tweet as a person-tweet if [ no organization term is in the name or the profile description fields ] AND [ all the words in the name field are person names OR the profile description field starts with either ?I?m?",
        "or ?I am? ]",
        "4 .",
        "To assess the accuracy of the person heuris-tic, we also performed a manual annotation task.",
        "We employed two annotators and provided them with guidelines of what constitutes an individual person's Twitter account.",
        "We defined an individual person as someone who uses Twitter in their day-to-day life to post information about his/her daily activities, update personal status messages, comment about societal issues and/or interact with close social circles.",
        "The annotators were able to see the name, profile description, location and url fields of the Twitter user account and were asked to label each account as individual, not individual or undetermined.",
        "To calculate annotator agreement between the two annotators, we gave them 100 Twitter accounts, corresponding to English tweets collected using the person heuristic.",
        "The inter-annotator agreement (IAA) was .98 (raw agree-ment) and .97 (G-Index score).",
        "We did not use 2 http://www.census.gov/genealogy/www/ data/1990surnames/names_files.html 3 http://genealogy.familyeducation.com/ browse/origin/spanish 4 Corresponding terms were used for Spanish Cohen's Kappa (?)",
        "as it is known to underestimate agreement (known as Kappa Paradox) when one category dominates.",
        "We then released another 250 accounts to each of the annotators, giving us a total of 600 manually labeled accounts 5 .",
        "In the distribution of labels assigned by the human annotators for these 600 accounts, 91.5% was confirmed as belonging to individual persons.",
        "5% was identified as not individual whereas 3.5% was labeled as undetermined.",
        "These numbers corroborate our claim that the person heuristic is a valid approximation for acquiring person-tweets.",
        "However, limiting our person-tweets to those from accounts identified with the person heuristic could introduce bias (i.e., it may consider only the people who provided more complete profile information).",
        "To address this issue, we looked into additional heuristics that are representative of individual persons?",
        "Twitter accounts.",
        "We observed that applications designed specifically for hand-held devices (e.g., twitter for iphone) are frequently used to author tweets and used by individual persons.",
        "Organizations, on the other hand, primarily use the Twitter web tool and content management software applications to create, manage and post content to Twitter.",
        "To further investigate our observation, we extracted the source information (i.e., the software applications used to author tweets) for a collection of 1.2 million English tweets from our tweet pool, for a random day, and identified those that were clearly hand-held device apps and covered at least 1% of the tweets.",
        "Table 1 shows the distribution of these hand-held device apps, which together accounted for approximately 66% of all tweets.",
        "Hand-held Device App % of Tweets twitter for iphone 37.11 twitter for android 16.50 twitter for blackberry 5.50 twitter for ipad 2.55 mobile web (m2) 1.46 ios 1.36 echofon 1.29 ALL 65.77 Table 1: Percentage of (English) tweets authored from hand-held device apps To evaluate our hypothesis that a high percentage of these tweets are person-tweets, we carried out another manual annotation task.",
        "We selected 5 We adjudicated the disagreements in the initial 100 Twitter accounts.",
        "100 100 English Twitter accounts whose tweets were generated using one of the above hand-held device apps and asked the two annotators to label them using the same guidelines.",
        "For this task, the IAA was .84 (raw agreement) and .76 (G-Index score).",
        "As before, we released another 250 accounts to each of the annotators.",
        "In these 600 user accounts, 87.1% was confirmed to be individual persons.",
        "Only 1% was judged to be clearly not individual whereas 11.9% was labeled as undetermined.",
        "3.1.2 Acquiring Organization-tweets Designing similar heuristics to identify organization-tweets proved to be difficult.",
        "Organizations describe themselves in numerous ways, making it difficult to automatically identify their names in user profiles.",
        "Furthermore, organization names often appear in individual persons?",
        "accounts because they mention their employers (e.g., I?m a software engineer at Microsoft Corpo-ration).",
        "Therefore, to acquire organization-tweets, we relied on web-based directories of organizations (e.g., www.twellow.com) and gathered their tweets using the Twitter API.",
        "We used 58 organization accounts for English tweets and 83 accounts for Spanish.",
        "3.1.3 Complete Data Set We created a data set of 200,000 tweets for each language, consisting of 90% person-tweets and 10% organization-tweets.",
        "Among the 180,000 person-tweets, 132,000 (66% of 200,000) were tweets whose source was a hand-held device app.",
        "To collect the remaining 48,000 (24% of 200,000) of the person-tweets, we relied on the person heuristic.",
        "Finally, we gathered 20,000 organization-tweets using the web directories mentioned previously.",
        "In doing so, to ensure that we had a balanced mix of organizations, each organization contributed with a maximum of 500 tweets.",
        "4 User Type Classification To automatically distinguish person-tweets from organization-tweets, we trained a supervised classifier using N-gram features, an organization heuristic, and a linguistic feature set categorized into six classes.",
        "For the classification algorithm, we employed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel, using the LIBSVM package (Chang and Lin, 2011).",
        "For the features that rely on part-of-speech (POS) tags, we used the English Twitter POS tagger by Gimpel et al. (2011) and another tagger trained on the CoNLL 2002 shared task data for Spanish (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002) using the OpenNLP toolkit (OpenSource, 2010).",
        "4.1 N-gram Features We started off by introducing N-gram features to capture the words in a tweet.",
        "Specifically, we trained a supervised classifier using unigram and bigram features encoded with binary values.",
        "In selecting the N-gram features, we discarded any N-gram that appears less than five times in the training data.",
        "4.2 Organization Heuristic Following observations by Messner et al. (2011), we combined two simple heuristic rules to flag tweets that are likely to be from an organization.",
        "The first observation is that ?replies?",
        "(i.e., @user mentions at the beginning of a tweet) are uncommon in organization-tweets.",
        "Hence, if a tweet is a reply, it is likely to be a person-tweet.",
        "The second observation is that organization-tweets frequently include a web link to external content.",
        "Our organization heuristic, therefore, combined these two properties.",
        "If the tweet is not a reply AND contains a web link, we labeled it as an organization-tweet.",
        "Otherwise, we labeled it as a person-tweet.",
        "In Section 5, we evaluate this heuristic as a classification rule on its own, and also incorporate its label as a feature in our classifier.",
        "4.3 Linguistic Features In the following sections, we describe our linguistic features and the intuitions in designing them.",
        "4.3.1 Emotion and Sentiment Twitter is a platform where individuals often express emotion.",
        "We detected emotions using four feature types: 1) interjections, 2) profanity, 3) emoticons and 4) overall sentiment of the tweet.",
        "Interjections, profanity, and emoticons are widely used by individuals to convey emotion, such as anger, surprise, happiness, etc.",
        "To identify these three feature types, we used a combination of POS tags in the English tagger (which contains tags for interjections, emoticons, etc), compiled lists of interjections and profanity from the 101 web for both English 6 and Spanish 7 and regular expression patterns for emoticons.",
        "We also included sentiment features using the sentiment140 API 8 (Go et al., 2009).",
        "This API provides a sentiment label (positive, negative or neutral) for a tweet corresponding to its overall sentiment.",
        "We expect person-tweets to show more positive and negative sentiment and organization-tweets to be more neutral.",
        "4.3.2 Similarity to News Headlines Earlier, we observed that organization-tweets are often similar to news headlines.",
        "To exploit this ob-servation, we introduced four features using language models and verb categories.",
        "First, we collected 3 million person-tweets, for each language, using the person heuristic described in Section 3.1.",
        "Second, we collected another 3 million news headlines from each of the English and Spanish Gigaword corpora (Parker et al., 2009; Mendonca et al., 2009).",
        "Using these two data sets, we built unigram and bigram language models (with Laplace smoothing) for person-tweets and for news headlines.",
        "Given a new tweet, we calculated the probability of the tweet using both the person-tweet and headline language models.",
        "We defined a binary feature that indicates which unigram language model (person- tweet model vs. headline model) produced the highest probability.",
        "A similar feature is defined for the bigram language models.",
        "We also observed that certain verbs are predominantly used in news headlines and are rarely associated with colloquial language (therefore, in person-tweets).",
        "Similarly, we observed verbs that are much more likely to be used by individual persons.",
        "To identify the most discriminating verbs, we ranked verbs appearing more than 5 times in the collected news headlines and person-tweets based on the following probabilities: p(h|verb) = Frequency of verb in headlines Frequency of verb in all instances p(pt|verb) = Frequency of verb in person-tweets Frequency of verb in all instances The verbs were sorted by probability and we retained two disjoint sets of verbs, 1) the verbs most 6 http://www.noswearing.com/dictionary 7 http://nawcom.com/swearing/mexican_ spanish.htm 8 http://help.sentiment140.com/api representative of headlines (i.e., headline verbs), selected by applying a threshold of p(h|verb) > 0.8 and 2) verbs most representative of person-tweets (i.e., personal verbs), with a similar threshold of p(pt|verb) > 0.8.",
        "We introduced two binary features that look for verbs in the tweet from these two learned verb lists.",
        "The top-ranked verbs for each category are displayed in Table 2.",
        "The learned headline verbs tend to be more formal and are often used in business or government contexts (e.g., revoke, granting, etc) whereas the personal verbs tend to represent personal activities, communications, and emotions (e.g., hate, sleep, etc).",
        "In total, we learned 687 headline verbs and 2221 personal verbs for English, and 1924 headline verbs and 5719 personal verbs for Spanish.",
        "Headline verbs: aided, revoke, issued, broaden, tes-tify, leads, postponing, forged, deepen, hijacked, raises, granting, honoring, pledged, departing, suspending, cit-ing, compensate, preserved, weakening, differing Personal verbs: raining, sleep, hanging, hate, march-ing, teaching, sway, having, risk, lurk, screaming, tag-ging, disturb, baking, exaggerate, pinch, enjoy, shred-ding, force, hide, wreck, saved, cooking, blur, told Table 2: Top-ranked representative verbs learned from headlines and person-tweets 4.3.3 1 st and 2 nd Person Pronouns Person-tweets often include self-references, in the form of first-person pronouns and their variant forms (e.g., possessive, reflexive), while organization-tweets rarely contain self-references.",
        "Also, organizations often address their audience using second-person pronouns in tweets (e.g., Will you High Five the #Bruins or #Blackhawks?",
        "Sign up for a chance to win a trip to the Cup Final: http://t.co/XQP8ZDOINV).",
        "To capture these char-acteristics, we included two binary features that look for 1 st and 2 nd person pronouns in a tweet.",
        "4.3.4 NER Features We hypothesized that organization-tweets will carry more named entities and proper nouns.",
        "For English tweets, we identified Persons, Organizations and Locations using the Named Entity Recognizer (NER) from Ritter et al. (2011).",
        "For Spanish tweets, we used NER models trained on CoNLL 2002 shared task data for Spanish.",
        "The features were encoded as three values, representing the frequency of each entity type in a tweet.",

        "Hence, we introduced a feature to determine the informality of a tweet.",
        "Specifically, we check if a tweet begins with an uppercase letter or not, and whether sentences are properly separated with punctuation.",
        "To accomplish this, we used regular expression patterns that look for capitalized characters following punctuation and white-space characters.",
        "We also added a feature to check if all the letters in the tweet are lowercased.",
        "Use of elongated words (e.g., cooooooool) for emphasis, is another property of person-tweets and we captured this property by identifying words with three or more repetitions of the same character.",
        "To comply with the 140 character length restriction of a tweet, person-tweets often employ ad-hoc short-hand usage of words that omit or replace characters with a phonetic substitute (e.g., 2mrw, good n8).",
        "We used lists of common abbreviations found in social media 9 collected from the web and a binary feature was set if a tweet contained an instance from these lists.",
        "4.3.6 Twitter Stylistic Features One can also notice structural properties that are prevalent in either user type.",
        "News organizations often append a topic descriptor to the beginning of a tweet (e.g., Petraeus affair: Woman who complained of harassing emails identified http://t.co/hpyLQYeL).",
        "To encode this behavior, we employed a simple heuristic that looked for a semicolon or a hyphen within the first three words of a tweet.",
        "Also, person-tweets employ heavy use of hashtags so we included the frequency of hashtags in a tweet as a single feature.",
        "We added two more features in the form of the length of the tweet 9 http://www.noslang.com/dictionary/ full/ and the frequency of @user mentions in the tweet.",
        "5 Evaluation of User Type Classification In this section, we discuss and evaluate our user type classifier.",
        "All of the experiments were carried out using five-fold cross-validation, using data sets described in Section 3.1.",
        "In these experiments, we maintained the separation of organization-tweets at a user-account level in order to avoid tweets from one organization appearing in both train and test sets.",
        "5.1 User Type Classifier Results We first evaluated several baseline systems to assess the difficulty of the user type classification task.",
        "We report precision, recall and F 1 -score with organization-tweets as the positive class.",
        "To evaluate our hypothesis that organization-tweets are similar to news headlines, we first predicted user types using only the unigram and bigram language models described in Section 4.3.2.",
        "As shown in Table 3 (ULM & BLM), unigram models were capable of discerning organization-tweets with 71% and 66% precision on English and Spanish tweets, respectively.",
        "This is substantial performance given that the random chance of labeling an organization-tweet (i.e., precision) is merely 10%.",
        "The bigram models show ?",
        "80% precision whereas the unigram models show higher recall.",
        "As another baseline, we evaluated an SVM classifier that uses only N-gram features.",
        "As Table 3 shows, the N-gram classifier (NGR) achieved very high precision (86%) for both English and Spanish tweets.",

        "For instance, a Twitter search for civil unrest events with a few representative keywords (e.g., strike, rally, riot, etc.)",
        "can often lead to results referring to sports events, such as a bowling strike or a tennis rally or where the keywords are used figuratively (e.g., She's a riot!).",
        "In this section, we investigate if the user type of a tweet can help cut through such ambiguity.",
        "Specif-ically, we hypothesize that event keywords may be used more consistantly and with less ambiguity in organization-tweets, and therefore user type information may be helpful in improving event recognition.",
        "To explore our hypothesis that the user type can influence the event relevance of a tweet, we constructed a set of experiments using two types of events civil unrest events and disease outbreaks.",
        "Civil unrest refers to forms of public disturbance that affect the order of a society (e.g., strikes, protests, etc.)",
