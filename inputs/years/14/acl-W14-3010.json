        "Sentiment Analysis, an important area of Natural Language Understanding, often relies on the assumption that lexemes carry inherent sentiment values, as reflected in specialized resources.",

        "Our results show, first, that the intensifying adverbs are not themselves sentiment-laden but strengthen the sentiment conveyed by words in their contexts to different degrees.",

        "It was probably Chuck who coined the term ?arm- chair linguist?",

        "Chuck Fillmore's deep commitment to the study of language ?",
        "in particular lexical semantics ?",
        "on the basis of corpus data served as a model that kept many of us honest in our investigation of language.",
        "Today, we are lucky to be able to work from our office chairs while collecting data from a broad speaker group by means of crowdsourcing.",

        "2 Sentiment Analysis Broadly speaking, sentiment analysis (SA) attempts to automatically derive a writer's ?senti- ment?",
        "about the topic of a text.",
        "?Sentiment?",
        "is usually categorized into ?positive,?",
        "?neutral?",

        "to dissatisfaction or unhappiness.",
        "Some work in SA further distinguishes degrees of positive and negative sentiment.",
        "SA often refers to lexical resources where words are annotated with a sentiment value.",

        "Other resources include Appraisal Lexicon (AL) (Taboada and Grieve, 2004) and Micro-WNOp (Cerini et al., 2007).",
        "Much of this work relies on the assumption that specific lexemes (unique mappings of word forms and word meanings) carry an inherent sentiment value.",
        "This seems intuitively correct for words like enjoy (positive), pencil (neutral) and pain (nega- tive).",
        "Other words may not carry inherent sentiment value yet, in context, contribute to that of the words they co-occur with or modify.",
        "One such class of words comprises what we call polarity intensifiers.",

        "Three main observations can be made: (1) the adverb appears in both positive and negative sentiment-bearing sentences (S1 is negative and S2 is positive); (2) its removal from either S1 or S2 does not change the overall polarity of the sentence; (3) intuitively, S1 has a stronger negative polarity value than S1?",

        "We manually inspected the sentences and discarded those where the target adverb was used in a modal sense, as in Seriously, there was not one respectable character in the entire script while retaining sentences like There is no doubt that Alfred Hitchcock was a seriously talented director.",

        "Our target adverbs have inherent polarity as claimed in some sentiment lexicons (see Table 1).",
        "40 If the polarity of a sentence does not change when the adverbs is present or absent, we conclude that the adverb has no inherent polarity but may merely affect the intensity of the constituents that it modifies.",

        "Instead, they modify the intensity of the sentiment connoted by the context.",
        "4 Discussion We examined the effect of eight intensifying adverbs on the sentiment ratings of the sentences in which they occur.",
        "Our study showed that, contrary to their representation in some widely used sentiment lexicons, these adverbs do not carry an inherent sentiment polarity, but merely alter the degree of the polarity of the constituents they modify; corrections of the corresponding entries in the sentiment resources seem warranted.",
        "Our results show further that all adverbs strengthen the polarity of the context to different degrees.",
        "If confirmed on a larger data set, this indicates that the intensifying force of different adverbs should be reflected in lexical resources, perhaps along an ordered scale.",
