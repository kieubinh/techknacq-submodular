        "A cornerstone of exploratory data analysis is visualization.",
        "Tremendous academic effort and engineering expertise has created and refined a myriad of visualizations available to the data explorer, yet there still exists a paucity of options for visualizing language data.",
        "While visualizing human language is a broad subject, we apply Polya's dictum, and examine a pair of simpler questions for which we still lack an answer: ?",
        "(1) what is in this corpus of documents?",
        "?",
        "(2) what is the relationship between these two corpora of documents?",
        "We assert that addressing these two questions is a step towards creating visualizations of human language more suitable for exploratory data analysis.",
        "In order to create a meaningful visualiza-tion, one must understand the inference question the visualization is meant to inform (i.e., the reason for which (1) is being asked), so the appropriate aspects of the data can be highlighted with the aesthetics of the visualization.",
        "Different inference questions require different aspects to be high-lighted, so we aim to create a maximally-flexible, yet simple and intuitive method to enable a user to explore the relevant aspects of their data, and adapt the visualization to their task at hand.",
        "The primary contributions of this paper are: ?",
        "A visualization of language data tailored for exploratory data analysis, designed to examine a single corpus (the dynamic wordcloud) and to compare two corpora (the Venncloud); ?",
        "The framing and analysis of the problem in terms of the existing psychophysical litera-ture; ?",
        "Distributable JavaScript code, designed to be simple to use, adapt, and extend.",
        "We base our visualizations on the wordcloud, which we deconstruct and analyze in ?3 and ?4.",
        "We then discuss the literature on wordclouds and relevant psychophysical findings in ?5, taking guidance from the practical and theoretical foundations explored there.",
        "We then draw heavily on similarities to more common and well understood visualizations to create a more useful version of the wordcloud.",
        "Question (1) is addressed in ?7, and with only a small further expansion described in ?8, an approach to (2) becomes evident.",
        "2 Motivating Inference Tasks Exploratory data analysis on human language encompasses a diverse set of language and inference tasks, so we select the following subset for their variety.",
        "One task in line with question (1) is getting the general subject of a corpus, highlighting content-bearing words.",
        "One might want to examine a collection of social media missives, too numerous to read individually, perhaps to detect emerging news (Petrovic et al., 2013).",
        "Sepa-rately, author identification (or idiolect analysis) 22 attempts attribution of documents (e.g., Shake-speare's plays or the Federalist papers) by comparing the author's writing style, focusing on stylistic and contentless words ?",
        "for a review see (Juola, 2006).",
        "Further, some linguistic psychometric analysis depends on the relative distribution of pronouns and other seemingly contentless words (Coppersmith et al., 2014a; Chung and Pen-nebaker, 2007).",
        "Each of these questions involves some analysis of unigram statistics, but exactly what analysis differs significantly, thus no single wordcloud can display all of them.",
        "Any static wordcloud is a single point in a distribution of possible wordclouds ?",
        "one way of calculating statistics from the underlying language and mapping those calculations to the visual representation.",
        "Many such combinations and mappings are available, and the optimal wordcloud, like the optimal plot, is a function of the data and the inference task at hand.",
        "Thus, we enable the wordcloud viewer to adjust the relationship between the aspects of the data and the aesthetics of the display, which allows them to view different points in the distribution of possible wordclouds.",
        "The dynamic wordcloud was implicitly called for in (Rayson and Garside, 2000) since human expertise (specifically knowledge of broader contexts and common sense) is needed to separate meaningful and non-meaningful differences in wordclouds.",
        "We enable this dynamic interaction between human and visualization in real-time with a simple user interface, requiring only a modicum more engineering than the creation of a static wordcloud, though the depth of extra information conveyed is significant.",
        "3 Wordcloud Aesthetics We refer to each visual component of the visualization as an aesthetic (ala (Wickham, 2009)) ?",
        "each aesthetic can convey some information to the viewer.",
        "For context, the aesthetics of a scatterplot include the x and y position, color, and size of each point.",
        "Some are best suited for ordinal data (e.g., font size), while others for categorical data (e.g., font color).",
        "Ordinal data can be encoded by font size, the most prominent and noticeable to the viewer (Bateman et al., 2008).",
        "Likewise, the opacity (transparency) of the word is a prominent and ordinal aesthetic.",
        "The order in which words are displayed can convey a significant amount of information as well, but using order in this fashion generally constrains the use of x and y position.",
        "Categorical data can be encoded by the color of each word ?",
        "both the foreground of the word itself and the background space that surrounds it (though that bandwidth is severely limited by human perception).",
        "Likewise for font weight (bold- ness) and font decoration (italics and underlines).",
        "While font face itself could encode a categorical variable, making comparisons of all the other aspects across font faces is likely to be at best uninformative and at worst misleading.",
        "4 Data Aspects As the wordcloud has visual aesthetics that we can control (?3), the data we need to model has aspects that we want to represent with those aesthetics.",
        "This aspect-to-aesthetic mapping is what makes a useful and informative visualization, and needs to be flexible enough to allow it be used for a range of inference tasks.",
        "For clarity, we define a word (w) as a unique set of characters and a word token (w) as a single usage of a word in a document.",
        "We can observe multiple word tokens (w) of the same word (w) in a single document (d).",
        "For any document d we represent the term frequency of w as tf d (w).",
        "Similarly, the inverse document frequency of w as idf(w).",
        "A combination of tf and idf is often used to determine important words in a document or corpus.",
        "We focus on tf and idf here, but this is just an example of an ordinal value associated with a word, there are many other such word-ordinal pairings that are worth exploring (e.g., weights in a classifier).",
        "The dynamic range (?scaling?",
        "in (Wickham, 2009)) also needs to be considered, since the data has a natural dynamic range ?",
        "where meaningful differences can be observed (unsurprisingly, the definition of meaningful depends on the inference task).",
        "Likewise, each aesthetic has a range of values for which the users can perceive and differentiate (e.g., words in a font size too small are illeg-ible, those too large prevent other words from being displayed; not all differences are perceptible).",
        "Mapping the relevant dynamic range of the data to the dynamic range of the visualization is at the heart of a good visualization, but to do this algorithmically for all possible inference tasks remains a challenge.",
        "We, instead, enable the user to adjust the dynamic range of the visualization explicitly.",
        "23 5 Prior Art Wordclouds have a mixed history, stemming from Jim Flanagan's ?Search Referral Zeitgeist?, used to display aggregate information about websites linking to his, to its adoption as a visual gim-mick, to the paradoxical claim that ?wordclouds work in practice, but not in theory?",
        "(see (Vi?egas and Wattenberg, 2008) for more).",
        "A number of wordcloud-generators exist on the web (e.g., (Feinberg, 2013; Davies, 2013)), though these tend towards creating art rather than informative visualizations.",
        "The two cited do allow the user limited interaction with some of the visual aesthet-ics, though not of sufficient scope or response time for general exploratory data analysis.",
        "Enumerating all possible inference tasks involving the visualization of natural language is impos-sible, but the prior art does provide empirical data for some relevant tasks.",
        "This further stresses the importance of allowing the user to interact with the visualization, since optimizing the visualization a priori for all inference tasks simultaneously is not possible, much like creating a single plot for all numerical inference tasks is not possible.",
        "5.1 Psychophysical Analyses The quintessential studies on how a wordcloud is interpreted by humans can be found in (Ri- vadeneira et al., 2007) and (Bateman et al., 2008).",
        "They both investigated various measures of impression-forming and recall to determine which aesthetics conveyed information most effectively ?",
        "font size chief among them.",
        "Rivandeneira et al. (Rivadeneira et al., 2007) also found that word-order was important for impression forming (displaying words from most frequent to least frequent was most effective here), while displaying words alphabetically was best when searching for a known word.",
        "They also found that users prefer a search box when searching for something specific and known, and a wordcloud for exploratory tasks and things unknown.",
        "Bateman et al. (Bateman et al., 2008) examined the relative utility of other aesthetics to convey in-formation, finding that font-weight (boldness) and intensity (opacity) are effective, but not as good as font-size.",
        "Aesthetics such as color, number of characters or the area covered by the word were less effective.",
        "Significant research has gone in to the placement of words in the wordcloud (e.g., (Seifert et al., 2008)), though seemingly little information can be conveyed by these layouts (Schrammel et al., 2009).",
        "Indeed, (Rivadeneira et al., 2007) indicates that words directly adjacent to the largest word in the wordcloud had slightly worse recall than those not-directly-adjacent ?",
        "in essence, getting the most important words in the center may be counterproductive.",
        "Thus we eschew these algorithms in favor of more interpretable (but perhaps less aesthetically pleasing) linear ordered layouts.",
        "5.2 Wordclouds as a tool Illustrative investigations of the wordcloud as a tool for exploratory data analysis are few, but encouraging.",
        "In relation to question (1), even static wordclouds can be useful for this task.",
        "Users performing an open-ended search task preferred using a wordcloud to a search box (Sinclair and Cardew-Hall, 2008), possibly because the wordcloud prevented them from having to hypothesize what might be in the collection before searching for it.",
        "Similarly, wordclouds can be used as a follow-up display of search results from a query performed via a standard text search box (Knautz et al., 2010), providing the user a crude summary of the results.",
        "In both of these cases, a simple static wordcloud is able to provide some useful information to the user, though less research has been done to determine the optimal composition of the wordcloud.",
        "What's more, the need for a dynamic interactive wordcloud was made explicit (Knautz et al., 2010), given the way the users iteratively refined their queries and wordclouds.",
        "Question (2) has also been examined.",
        "One approach is to make a set of wordclouds with soft constraints that the same word appears in roughly the same position across multiple clouds to facilitate comparisons (Castella and Sutton, 2013).",
        "Each of these clouds in a wordstorm visualizes a different collection of documents (e.g., subdivisions via metadata of a larger corpus).",
        "Similarly addressing our second question, Parallel Tag Clouds (Collins et al., 2009) allow the comparison of multiple sets of documents (or different partitions of a corpus).",
        "This investigation provides a theoretically-justified approach to finding ?the right?",
        "static wordcloud (for a single inference task), though this does depend on some language-specific resources (e.g., stopword lists and stemming).",
        "Interestingly, they opt for ex-24 plicit removal of words and outliers that the user does not wish to have displayed (an exclusion list), rather than adjusting calculations of the entire cloud to remove them in a principled and fair manner.",
        "5.3 Wordclouds and Metadata Wordclouds have previously been extended to convey additional information, though these adaptations have been optimized generally for artistic purposes rather than exploratory data analysis.",
        "Wordclouds can been used to display how language interacts with a temporal dimension in (Du- binko et al., 2007; Cui et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2010).",
        "Dubinko and colleagues created a tag cloud variant that displays trends in tag usage over time, coupled with images that have that tag (Dubinko et al., 2007).",
        "An information-theoretic approach to displaying information changing in time gives rise to a theoretically grounded approach for displaying pointwise tag clouds, and highlighting those pieces that have changed significantly as compared to a previous time period (Cui et al., 2010).",
        "This can be viewed as measuring the change in overall language usage over time.",
        "In contrast, using spark lines on each individual word or tag can convey temporal trends for individual words (Lee et al., 2010).",
        "Meanwhile, combining tag clouds with geospa-tial data yields a visualization where words can be displayed on a map of the world in locations they are frequently tagged in, labeling famous land-marks, for example (Slingsby et al., 2007).",
        "6 Desiderata In light of the diverse inference tasks (?2) and prior art (?5), the following desiderata emerge for the visualization.",
        "These desiderata are explicit choices, not all of which are ideal for all inference tasks.",
        "Thus, chief among them is the first: flexibility to allow maximum extensions and modifications as needed.",
        "Flexible and adjustable in real time: Any single static wordcloud is guaranteed to be suboptimal for at least some inference tasks, so allowing the user to adjust the aspect-to-aesthetic mapping of the wordcloud in real time enables adaptation of the visualization to the data and inference task at hand.",
        "The statistics described in ?4 are relevant to every language collection (and most inference tasks), yet there are a number of other ordinal values to associate a word (e.g., the weight assigned to it by a classifier).",
        "Thus, tf and idf are meant to be illustrative examples though the visualization code should generalize well to others.",
        "Though removal of the most frequent words (stopwords) is useful in many natural language processing tasks, there are many ways to define which words fall under this category.",
        "Unsurpris-ingly, the optimal selection of these words can also depend upon the task at hand (e.g., psychiatric v. thematic analysis as in ?2), so maximum flexibility and minimum latency are desirable.",
        "Interpretable: An explicit legend is needed to interpret the differences in visual aesthetics and what these differences mean with respect to the underlying data aspects.",
        "Language-Agnostic: We need methods for exploratory data analysis that work well regardless of the language(s) being investigated.",
        "This is crucial for multilingual corpora, yet decidedly nontrivial.",
        "These techniques must be maximally language-agnostic, relying on only the most rudimentary understanding of the linguistic structure of the data (e.g., spaces separate words in English, but not in Chinese), so they can be extended to many languages easily.",
        "This precludes the use of a fixed set of stop words for each language examined, since a new set of stopwords would be required for each language explored.",
        "Alternatively, the set of stopwords can be dealt with automatically, either by granting the user the ability to filter out words in the extremes of the distributions (tf and df alike) through the use of a weight which penalizes these ubiquitous or too-rare words.",
        "Similarly precluded is the use of stemming to deal with the many surface forms of a given root word (e.g., type, typing, typed).",
        "7 Dynamic Wordclouds We address Question (1) and a number of our desiderata with the addition of explicitly labeled controls to the static wordcloud display, which allows the user to control the mapping from data aspects to the visualization aesthetics.",
        "We supplement these controls with an explicit explanation of how each aesthetic is affected by each aspect, so the user can easily read the relevant mappings, rather than trying to interpret the location of the sliders.",
        "An example of which is that ?Larger words are those that frequently occur in the query?, when the aspect tf is mapped to the 25 [X] entities common cloud tf filter idf filter size controls opacity controls sort by wordcloud description do not redraw highlight keywords orioles at to for in baltimore a game i and yankees of go on is this vs w/ o's are it win with be i'm my you that others new have just 2 3 up 1 let's first so all tonight fans but out season we now get sox an time md series al baseball will about me not like as 5 playoff lets from over was they if what 4 good no great year day one love back amp fan magic can east playoffs beat gt red sports rt today do going how last more place team games night blue file:///Users/gcoppersmith/Desktop/dwc_dev/orioles.html 1 of 2 2/24/14, 4:36 PM [X] entities common cloud tf filter idf filter size controls opacity controls sort by wordcloud description do not redraw highlight keywords 13 espn fox leads md ny report star usa buck chris glove mark move press 14 gold hamilton jim third birds gonzalez j o september white homers rangers tigers 15 fall yankee sox yard al happen pick blue cc extra m old card closer hits tie tied face omg ravens says yahoo city saying second starting stay ass manager players real lt three bout football left sunday sweep goes hey gets wild yanks adam job news times won't magic place innings 2013 base gt hr pitching does fucking os rain 10 friday outs suck coming makes also check wearing haha show through god los losing may always being keep 9 hate gotta looks making posted away free im life we're weekend call give little bar bring didn't doing least look stop thing top where giants long photo record johnson league most thank tv ?",

        "The data aspects from ?4 are precomputed and mapped to the aesthetics from ?3 in a JavaScript visualization displayed in a standard web browser.",
        "This visualization enables the user to manipulate the aspect-to-aesthetic mapping via an intuitive set of sliders and buttons, responsive in real time.",
        "The sliders are roughly segmented into three cat-egories: those that control which words are dis-played, those that control how size is calculated, and those that control how opacity is calculated.",
        "The buttons control the order in which words appear.",
        "One set of sliders controls which words are displayed by examining the frequency and rarity of the words.",
        "We define the range ?",
        "Freq = [t min Freq , t max Freq ] as the range of tf values for words to be displayed (i.e., tf(w) ?",
        "?",
        "Freq ).",

        "Importantly, tf is computed from the current corpus displayed while df is computed over a much larger collection (in our running examples, all the works of Shakespeare or all the tweets for the last 6 months).",
        "Those with high df or high tf are often stopwords, those with low tf and low df are often rare, sometimes too rare to get good estimates of tf or idf (e.g., names).",
        "A second set of sliders controls the mapping between aspects and aesthetics for each individual word.",
        "Each aesthetic has a weight for the importance of rarity (?",
        "Rarity ) and the importance of frequency (?",
        "Freq ), corresponding to the current values of their respective slider (each in the range [0, 1]).",

        "Range ) and the weights for frequency and rarity of the word.",
        "In this manner, the weights are multiplicative, so interactions between the variables (e.g., tf*idf ) are apparent.",
        "Though unigram statistics are informative, seeing the unigrams in context is also important for many inference tasks.",
        "To enable this, we use reservoir sampling (Vitter, 1985) to maintain a representative sample of the observed occurrences of each word in context, which the user can view by clicking on the word in the wordcloud display.",
        "Examples of the dynamic wordcloud in various settings can be found in Figure 1, using a set of tweets containing ?Orioles?.",

        "Rather than determining the optimal wordcloud, we enable the wordcloud viewer to adapt the visualization to the data and inference task at hand.",
        "We suspect that the pendulum of control has swung too far, and that there is a subset of the possible control configurations that produce useful and informative wordclouds.",
        "Work is underway to collect feedback via instrumented dynamic wordclouds and Vennclouds as they are used for various inference tasks to address this.",
        "Previous research, logic, and intuition were used to create this step, though it requires further improvement and validation.",
        "We provide anecdotes about the usefulness of these dynamic wordclouds, but those anecdotes do not provide sufficient evidence that this method is somehow more efficient (in terms of human time) than existing methods.",
        "To make such claims, a controlled human-factors study is required, investigating (for a particular inference task) how this method affects the job of an exploratory data analyst.",
        "In the meantime, we hope making the code freely available 1 will better enable our fellow researchers to perform principled exploratory data analysis of human language content quickly and encourage a deeper understanding of data, within and across disciplines.",
