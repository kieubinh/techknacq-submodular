        "Recently much attention has been paid to visualizing the output of topic models fit using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Gardner et al., 2010; Chaney and Blei, 2012; Chuang et al., 2012b; Gre-tarsson et al., 2011).",
        "Such visualizations are challenging to create because of the high dimensionality of the fitted model ?",
        "LDA is typically applied to many thousands of documents, which are modeled as mixtures of dozens (or hundreds) of top-ics, which themselves are modeled as distributions over thousands of terms (Blei et al., 2003; Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004).",
        "The most promising basic technique for creating LDA visualizations that are both compact and thorough is interactivity.",
        "We introduce an interactive visualization system that we call LDAvis that attempts to answer a few basic questions about a fitted topic model: (1) What is the meaning of each topic?, (2) How prevalent is each topic?, and (3) How do the topics relate to each other?",
        "Different visual components answer each of these questions, some of which are original, and some of which are borrowed from existing tools.",
        "Our visualization (illustrated in Figure 1) has two basic pieces.",
        "First, the left panel of our visualization presents a global view of the topic model, and answers questions 2 and 3.",
        "In this view, we plot the topics as circles in the two-dimensional plane whose centers are determined by computing the distance between topics, and then by using multidimensional scaling to project the inter-topic distances onto two dimensions, as is done in (Chuang et al., 2012a).",
        "We encode each topic's overall prevalence using the areas of the circles, where we sort the topics in decreasing order of prevalence.",
        "Second, the right panel of our visualization depicts a horizontal barchart whose bars represent the individual terms that are the most useful for interpreting the currently selected topic on the left, and allows users to answer question 1, ?What is the meaning of each topic??.",
        "A pair of overlaid bars represent both the corpus-wide frequency of a given term as well as the topic-specific frequency of the term, as in (Chuang et al., 2012b).",
        "The left and right panels of our visualization are linked such that selecting a topic (on the left) reveals the most useful terms (on the right) for interpreting the selected topic.",
        "In addition, selecting a term (on the right) reveals the conditional distribution over topics (on the left) for the selected term.",
        "This kind of linked selection allows users to examine a large number of topic-term relationships in a compact manner.",
        "A key innovation of our system is how we determine the most useful terms for interpreting a given topic, and how we allow users to interactively ad-63 Figure 1: The layout of LDAvis, with the global topic view on the left, and the term barcharts (with Topic 34 selected) on the right.",
        "Linked selections allow users to reveal aspects of the topic-term relationships compactly.",
        "just this determination.",
        "A topic in LDA is a multinomial distribution over the (typically thousands of) terms in the vocabulary of the corpus.",
        "To interpret a topic, one typically examines a ranked list of the most probable terms in that topic, using anywhere from three to thirty terms in the list.",
        "The problem with interpreting topics this way is that common terms in the corpus often appear near the top of such lists for multiple topics, making it hard to differentiate the meanings of these topics.",
        "Bischof and Airoldi (2012) propose ranking terms for a given topic in terms of both the frequency of the term under that topic as well as the term's exclusivity to the topic, which accounts for the degree to which it appears in that particular topic to the exclusion of others.",
        "We propose a similar measure that we call the relevance of a term to a topic that allows users to flexibly rank terms in order of usefulness for interpreting topics.",
        "We discuss our definition of relevance, and its graphical interpretation, in detail in Section 3.1.",
        "We also present the results of a user study conducted to determine the optimal tuning parameter in the definition of relevance to aid the task of topic interpretation in Section 3.2, and we describe how we incorporate relevance into our interactive visualization in Section 4.",
        "2 Related Work Much work has been done recently regarding the interpretation of topics (i.e. measuring topic ?co- herence?)",
        "as well as visualization of topic models.",
        "2.1 Topic Interpretation and Coherence It is well-known that the topics inferred by LDA are not always easily interpretable by humans.",
        "Chang et al. (2009) established via a large user study that standard quantitative measures of fit, such as those summarized by Wallach et al. (2009), do not necessarily agree with measures of topic interpretability by humans.",
        "Ramage et al. (2009) assert that ?characterizing topics is hard?",
        "and describe how using the top-k terms for a given topic might not always be best, but offer few concrete alternatives.",
        "AlSumait et al. (2009), Mimno et al. (2011), and Chuang et al. (2013b) develop quantitative methods for measuring the interpretability of top-64 ics based on experiments with data sets that come with some notion of topical ground truth, such as document metadata or expert-created topic labels.",
        "These methods are useful for understanding, in a global sense, which topics are interpretable (and why), but they don't specifically attempt to aid the user in interpreting individual topics.",
        "Blei and Lafferty (2009) developed ?Turbo Top-ics?, a method of identifying n-grams within LDA-inferred topics that, when listed in decreasing order of probability, provide users with extra information about the usage of terms within topics.",
        "This two-stage process yields good results on experimental data, although the resulting output is still simply a ranked list containing a mixture of terms and n-grams, and the usefulness of the method for topic interpretation was not tested in a user study.",
        "Newman et al. (2010) describe a method for ranking terms within topics to aid interpretability called Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) ranking.",
        "Under PMI ranking of terms, each of the ten most probable terms within a topic are ranked in decreasing order of approximately how often they occur in close proximity to the nine other most probable terms from that topic in some large, external ?reference?",
        "corpus, such as Wikipedia or Google n-grams.",
        "Although this method correlated highly with human judgments of term importance within topics, it does not easily generalize to topic models fit to corpora that don't have a readily available external source of word co-occurrences.",
        "In contrast, Taddy (2011) uses an intrinsic measure to rank terms within topics: a quantity called lift, defined as the ratio of a term's probability within a topic to its marginal probability across the corpus.",
        "This generally decreases the rankings of globally frequent terms, which can be helpful.",
        "We find that it can be noisy, however, by giving high rankings to very rare terms that occur in only a single topic, for instance.",
        "While such terms may contain useful topical content, if they are very rare the topic may remain difficult to interpret.",
        "Finally, Bischof and Airoldi (2012) develop and implement a new statistical topic model that infers both a term's frequency as well as its exclusivity ?",
        "the degree to which its occurrences are limited to only a few topics.",
        "They introduce a univariate measure called a FREX score (?FRequency and EXclusivity?)",
        "which is a weighted harmonic mean of a term's rank within a given topic with respect to frequency and exclusivity, and they recommend it as a way to rank terms to aid topic interpretation.",
        "We propose a similar method that is a weighted average of the logarithms of a term's probability and its lift, and we justify it with a user study and incorporate it into our interactive visualization.",
        "2.2 Topic Model Visualization Systems A number of visualization systems for topic models have been developed in recent years.",
        "Several of them focus on allowing users to browse documents, topics, and terms to learn about the relationships between these three canonical topic model units (Gardner et al., 2010; Chaney and Blei, 2012; Snyder et al., 2013).",
        "These browsers typically use lists of the most probable terms within topics to summarize the topics, and the visualization elements are limited to barcharts or word clouds of term probabilities for each topic, pie charts of topic probabilities for each document, and/or various barcharts or scatterplots related to document metadata.",
        "Although these tools can be useful for browsing a corpus, we seek a more compact visualization, with the more narrow focus of quickly and easily understanding the individual topics themselves (without necessarily visualizing documents).",
        "Chuang et al. (2012b) develop such a tool, called ?Termite?, which visualizes the set of topic-term distributions estimated in LDA using a matrix layout.",
        "The authors introduce two measures of the usefulness of terms for understanding a topic model: distinctiveness and saliency.",
        "These quantities measure how much information a term conveys about topics by computing the Kullback-Liebler divergence between the distribution of topics given the term and the marginal distribution of topics (distinctiveness), optionally weighted by the term's overall frequency (saliency).",
        "The authors recommend saliency as a thresholding method for selecting which terms are included in the visualization, and they further use a seriation method for ordering the most salient terms to highlight differences between topics.",
        "Termite is a compact, intuitive interactive visualization of the topics in a topic model, but by only including terms that rank high in saliency or dis-tinctiveness, which are global properties of terms, it is restricted to providing a global view of the model, rather than allowing a user to deeply in-65 spect individual topics by visualizing a potentially different set of terms for every single topic.",
        "In fact, Chuang et al. (2013a) describe the use of a ?topic-specific word ordering?",
        "as potentially useful future work.",
        "3 Relevance of terms to topics Here we define relevance, our method for ranking terms within topics, and we describe the results of a user study to learn an optimal tuning parameter in the computation of relevance.",
        "3.1 Definition of Relevance Let ?",
        "kw denote the probability of term w ?",
        "{1, ..., V } for topic k ?",

        "One typically estimates ?",
        "in LDA using Variational Bayes methods or Collapsed Gibbs Sampling, and p w from the empirical distribution of the corpus (optionally smoothed by including prior weights as pseudo-counts).",

        "We used the Collapsed Gibbs Sampler algorithm (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004) to sample the latent topics for each of the N = 1, 590, 376 tokens in the data, and we saved their topic assignments from the last iteration (after convergence).",

        "{1, ..., 50} was assigned to Newsgroup g ?",

        "In the study we recruited 29 subjects among our colleagues (research scientists at AT&T Labs with moderate familiarity with text mining techniques and topic models), and each subject completed an online experiment consisting of 50 tasks, one for each topic in the fitted LDA model.",

        "In the 50-topic model fit to the 20 Newsgroups data, the first three topics comprise 12%, 9%, and 6% of the corpus, and all contain common, non-specific terms (although there are interesting dif-ferences: Topic 2 contains formal debate-related language such as ?conclusion?, ?evidence?, and ?argument?, whereas Topic 3 contains slang conversational language such as ?kinda?, ?like?, and ?yeah?).",
        "In addition to visualizing topic preva-lence, the left pane shows inter-topic differences.",
        "The default for computing inter-topic distances is Jensen-Shannon divergence, although other metrics are enabled.",
        "The default for scaling the set of inter-topic distances defaults to Principal Compo-nents, but other algorithms are also enabled.",
        "The second core feature of LDAvis is the ability to select a term (by hovering over it) to reveal its conditional distribution over topics.",
        "This distribution is visualized by altering the areas of the topic circles such that they are proportional to the term-specific frequencies across the corpus.",
        "This allows the user to verify, as discussed in Chuang et al. (2012a), whether the multidimensional scaling of topics has faithfully clustered similar topics in two-dimensional space.",
        "For example, in Figure 4, the term ?file?",
        "is selected.",
        "In the majority of this term's occurrences, it is drawn from one of several topics located in the upper left-hand region of the 68 Figure 4: The user has chosen to segment the fifty topics into four clusters, and has selected the green cluster to populate the barchart with the most relevant terms for that cluster.",
        "Then, the user hovered over the ninth bar from the top, ?file?, to display the conditional distribution over topics for this term.",
        "global topic view.",
        "Upon inspection, this group of topics can be interpreted broadly as a discussion of computer hardware and software.",
        "This verifies, to some extent, their placement, via multidimensional scaling, into the same two-dimensional region.",
        "It also suggests that the term ?file?",
        "used in this context refers to a computer file.",
        "However, there is also conditional probability mass for the term ?file?",
        "on Topic 34.",
        "As shown in Figure 1, Topic 34 can be interpreted as discussing the criminal punishment system where ?file?",
        "refers to court filings.",
        "Similar discoveries can be made for any term that exhibits polysemy (such as ?drive?",
        "appearing in computer- and automobile-related top-ics, for example).",
        "Beyond its within-browser interaction capability using D3 (Bostock et al., 2011), LDAvis leverages the R language (R Core Team, 2014) and specifically, the shiny package (Rstudio, 2014), to allow users to easily alter the topical distance measurement as well as the multidimensional scaling algorithm to produce the global topic view.",
        "In addition, there is an option to apply k-means clustering to the topics (as a function of their two-dimensional locations in the global topic view).",
        "This is merely an effort to facilitate semantic zooming in an LDA model with many topics where ?after-the-fact?",
        "clustering may be an easier way to estimate clusters of topics, rather than fitting a hierarchical topic model (Blei et al., 2003), for example.",
        "Selecting a cluster of topics (by clicking the Voronoi region corresponding to the cluster) reveals the most relevant terms for that cluster of topics, where the term distribution of a cluster of topics is defined as the weighted average of the term distributions of the individual topics in the cluster.",
        "In Figure 4, the green cluster of topics is selected, and the most relevant terms, displayed in the barchart on the right, are predominantly related to computer hardware and software.",
        "5 Discussion We have described a web-based, interactive visualization system, LDAvis, that enables deep inspection of topic-term relationships in an LDA model, while simultaneously providing a global view of the topics, via their prevalences and similarities to each other, in a compact space.",
        "We 69 also propose a novel measure, relevance, by which to rank terms within topics to aid in the task of topic interpretation, and we present results from a user study that show that ranking terms in decreasing order of probability is suboptimal for topic interpretation.",
        "The LDAvis visualization system (including the user study data) is currently available as an R package on GitHub: https://github.com/cpsievert/LDAvis.",
        "For future work, we anticipate performing a larger user study to further understand how to facilitate topic interpretation in fitted LDA mod-els, including a comparison of multiple methods, such as ranking by Turbo Topics (Blei and Laf-ferty, 2009) or FREX scores (Bischof and Airoldi, 2012), in addition to relevance.",
        "We also note the need to visualize correlations between topics, as this can provide insight into what is happening on the document level without actually displaying entire documents.",
        "Last, we seek a solution to the problem of visualizing a large number of topics (say, from 100 500 topics) in a compact way.",
