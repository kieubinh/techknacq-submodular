        "In computational linguistics and related fields, significant work has been invested in the development of algorithms for gaining insight from large bodies of text.",
        "The raw output of these techniques can be so complex that it is just as difficult and time consuming to understand as reading the text.",
        "Therefore, it is an especially challenging problem to develop visualizations that add analytic value, making complex analysis accessible by helping a user to understand and interact with the output of these algorithms.",
        "Topic Modeling is a common, data-driven technique for summarizing the content of large text corpora.",
        "This technique models documents as distributions of topics and topics as distributions of words.",
        "In practice, topic models are used to provide a high-level overview and guided exploration of a corpus.",
        "Prior work by others (Chaney and Blei, 2012) and by the author (Smith et al., 2014) has focused on visualizing the results of topic modeling to support these two goals, but these visualizations do not scale beyond 10 to 20 topics 1 .",
        "Topic models with a small number of topics may not accurately represent very diverse cor-pora; instead, representative topic models require a number of topics an order of magnitude higher, for which current visualization methods are not suitable.",
        "We propose a visualization that displays hierarchically arranged topics.",
        "As opposed to a flat model, which can be thought of as an unordered heap of topics, a hierarchical structure allows a user to ?drill into?",
        "topics of interest, meaning this technique supports directed exploration of a corpus regardless of the number of topics in the model.",
        "Although methods that use inherently hierarchical generative models do exist, we take a simple recursive approach that scales to large datasets and does not change or depend on the underlying topic modeling implementation.",
        "In principle, this technique could be applied to a range of topic modeling algorithms.",
        "We present this hierarchical model to the user through an intuitive interactive visual-ization, Hi?erarchie.",
        "Additionally, we demonstrate the capability with a Case Study on analyzing the news coverage surrounding the Malaysia Airlines flight that went missing on March 8, 2014.",
        "2 Related Work Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003b) is an unsupervised algorithm for performing statistical topic modeling that uses a ?bag of words?",
        "approach, treating each document as a set of unordered words.",
        "Each document is represented as a probability distribution over some top-ics, and each topic is a probability distribution over 1 Either the visualization becomes too confusing to understand or using the visualization to explore the corpus takes too much time ?",
        "or both.",
        "71 words.",
        "LDA is an effective, scalable approach to modeling a large text corpus; however, the result is a flat topic model with no hierarchical structure for a visualization to exploit.",
        "Approaches exist for learning topic hierarchies from data, such as the Nested Chinese restaurant process (Blei et al., 2003a) and Pachinko Allocation (Li and McCallum, 2006).",
        "These approaches build the intuitions of the hierarchy into the modeling algorithm.",
        "This adds additional complexity and tightly couples the hierarchical process with the underlying modeling algorithm.",
        "Our Hierarchical Topic Modeling method uses a simple top-down recursive approach of splitting and re-modeling a corpus to produce a hierarchical topic model that does not require a specific underlying topic modeling algorithm.",
        "This work is most similar to Dirichlet Compound Multinomial Latent Dirichlet Allocation, DCM-LDA, which processes the corpus via a bottom-up approach.",
        "DCM-LDA first trains unique topic models based on co-occurrence of words in each document, and then clusters topics across documents (Mimno and McCallum, 2007).",
        "Existing visualizations support analysis and exploration of topic models.",
        "Topical Guide (Gardner et al., 2010), TopicViz (Eisenstein et al., 2012), and the topic visualization of (Chaney and Blei, 2012) provide visualization and interaction with topic models for corpus exploration and understanding.",
        "These visualizations typically represent topics as word clouds, where the topic model as a whole is presented as an unordered set of topics.",
        "This approach is not optimal for efficient exploration and understanding, and the sea of word clouds quickly becomes overwhelming as the number of topics grows.",
        "Termite (Chuang et al., 2012) uses a tabular layout to represent a topic model and supports easy comparison of words within and across topics.",
        "The Termite visualization organizes the model into clusters of related topics based on word overlap.",
        "This visualization technique is space saving and the clustering speeds corpus understanding.",
        "Our approach clusters topics by document overlap instead of word overlap and is hierarchical, providing multiple levels of related topics for intuitive corpus exploration.",
        "Nested lists, icicle plots (Kruskal and Landwehr, 1983), and treemaps (Shneider- man, 1998) are commonly used for visualizing hierarchical data, but they have limitations and do not easily support data-dense hierarchies, such as hierarchical topic models.",
        "Nested lists can be hard to navigate as they fail to maintain the same size and approximate structure during exploration.",
        "An icicle plot, which is a vertical representation of a partition chart, suffers from similar rendering constraints and limits positioning, sizing, and readability of text labeling.",
        "Treemaps use nested rectangles to display hierarchical data, but have been criticized as not cognitively plausible (Fab- rikant and Skupin, 2005), making them difficult to interpret.",
        "Additionally, as is the case for nested lists and icicle plots, treemaps obscure the structure of the underlying data to accommodate layout and sizing constraints.",
        "Hi?erarchie uses an interactive sunburst chart (Stasko et al., 2000), which is a partition chart with radial orientation that supports visualizing large or small hierarchies without requiring scrolling or other interaction.",
        "The sunburst chart implementation used by Hi?erarchie is directly based upon the Sequences Sunburst (Rodden, 2013) and Zoomable Sunburst (Bostock, 2012b) examples that are implemented in the Data-Driven Documents library (Bostock, 2012a).",
        "3 Hierarchical Topic Modeling The HLDA algorithm takes a simple, top-down approach for producing hierarchical topic models by recursively splitting and re-modeling a corpus.",
        "Standard LDA discovers the distribution of words in topics and topics in documents through an inference process; our implementation uses Gibbs sampling (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004) for inference.",
        "As a result of this process, each word in a document is assigned to a topic.",
        "At the end of sampling, HLDA uses these word-to-topic assignments to construct new synthetic documents for each topic from each of the initial documents.",
        "These synthetic documents contain only those words from the original document that are assigned to the topic and make up the synthetic corpus for the topic.",
        "So, if there are 10 topics in the topic model, up to 10 new synthetic documents ?",
        "one for each topic ?",
        "will be created for each document, and these documents will be merged into the topic's synthetic corpus.",
        "For each topic, t, we then construct a new topic model, m t , using the synthetic corpus corresponding to t. The discovered topics in m t represent the subtopics of t. This process, illustrated in 72 Figure 1: Overview of the HLDA algorithm.",
        "The algorithm runs LDA over the original corpus which results in a topic model and word-topic assignments.",
        "These word-topic assignments are used to create synthetic documents ?",
        "one for each document/topic pair.",
        "The synthetic documents are grouped into synthetic corpora by topic, and LDA is run for each of the synthetic corpora.",
        "This process continues recursively until the synthetic corpus and documents are too small to model.",
        "The result is a hierarchy of topic distributions.",
        "Figure 1, can be repeated recursively, until the synthetic corpus and synthetic documents are too small to model.",
        "2 While the number of topics at each level in the hierarchy must be specified, the overall number of topics discovered by this approach is a byproduct of the algorithm.",
        "This modeling approach is a wrapper algorithm that can be applied to any modeling approach that assigns individual tokens in documents to specific topics.",
        "4 Hi ?",
        "erarchie To effectively visualize the topic hierarchy output from HLDA, it is important to properly convey the relevance and structure of the topics.",
        "Intuitive interaction with the visualization is important so users can easily explore topics and identify patterns.",
        "Without effective visualization, forming conclusions becomes as difficult as approaching the raw documents without the benefit of algorithmic analysis.",
        "In practice, a diverse set of visualizations are used to display hierarchical data.",
        "An effective visualization of a hierarchical topic model should support the following Use Cases: 1.",
        "Accuracy display topics without hiding or skewing the hierarchical structure 2.",

        "to explore the topics at all levels of the hierarchy 3.",
        "Accessibility view the underlying data associated with the topics Many of the visualizations we considered for viewing topic hierarchies obscure or misrepresent the true structure of their underlying data, largely due to the amount of space required for rendering.",
        "Others provide less skewing of the structure, yet, for large hierarchies, require a high degree of user interaction (clicking and navigating) to expose the underlying data.",
        "We found that a sunburst chart is best suited to our purposes as it supports visualizing large or small hierarchies without requiring scrolling or other interaction.",
        "Unlike other hierarchical visualizations, the sunburst can accommodate the size of a typical computer screen without hiding or minimizing structure.",
        "Figure 2 displays a top-level view of the Hi?erarchie visualization for a dataset of Tweets, Reddit comments, and news articles regarding the Malaysia Airlines flight.",
        "Each level of the hierarchical topic model is represented as a ring of the Sunburst chart where the arcs comprising the rings represent the individual topics.",
        "By not labeling each arc, or ?slice,?",
        "within the sunburst, the high-level overview of the hierarchical topic model is presented to the user with minimal complexity.",
        "The initial, high-level view of the sunburst chart follows the design principle of overview first, zoom and filter, details on demand (Shnei- 73 Figure 2: The top-level view of the Hi?erarchie visualization.",
        "This visualization uses a sunburst chart, which is optimal for displaying the topic hierarchy created by the HLDA algorithm without hiding or skewing the hierarchical structure.",
        "derman, 1996) and does not display details for every topic, requiring user interaction to expose additional data.",
        "In our sunburst visualization, user interaction allows for exploration of the information at a finer granularity.",
        "When hovering over a topic of interest, the words of the topic are displayed in the empty center of the sunburst.",
        "This is an efficient use of space and prevents disorienta-tion, since minimal eye movement is required between the slice of interest (where the user's mouse is located) and the center list of topics.",
        "When a user selects a slice of interest, the sunburst zooms in to display the selected topic and sub-topics.",
        "This allows the user to analyze a specific section of the hierarchy.",
        "This interaction is shown in Figures 4 and 5.",
        "The sunburst has reoriented to display the selected sub-topic, (plane, crash, crashed) as the visualization root.",
        "To provide a clean and meaningful display of topic information for each slice, only one slice's information can be shown at a time.",
        "As the sunburst zooms to display selected topics, it is useful to provide context for the location of the topic within the overall topic hierarchy.",
        "Therefore, two contextual visualizations ?",
        "a breadcrumb trail and a contextual anchor ?",
        "are provided.",
        "Breadcrumb trails are often utilized to provide context during navigation, such as when navigating a file structure or large retail website.",
        "The breadcrumb trail displays the hierarchical path leading to the current topic (Aery, 2007).",
        "A contextual anchor, or contextual snapshot (Mindek et al., 2013), is used to provide additional context to the user.",
        "The contextual anchor displays the entire hierarchical topic model to the user at all times.",
        "When the user selects a topic slice to view a section of the hierarchy in more detail, the contextual anchor highlights the position of the selected topic within the hierarchical topic model.",
        "This offers context to the user, regardless of their location within the hierarchy.",
        "An example of the breadcrumb trail and contextual anchor is displayed in Figure 3.",
        "5 Case Study The search for Malaysia Flight MH-370 was ongoing during the composition of this paper, with few clues indicating what might have actually occurred.",
