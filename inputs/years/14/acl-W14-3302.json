        "We present the results of the shared tasks of the Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT) held at ACL 2014.",
        "This workshop builds on eight previous WMT workshops (Koehn and Monz, 2006; Callison-Burch et al., 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012; Bojar et al., 2013).",
        "This year we conducted four official tasks: a translation task, a quality estimation task, a metrics task 1 and a medical translation task.",
        "In the translation task (?2), participants were asked to translate a shared test set, optionally restricting themselves to the provided training data.",
        "We held ten translation tasks this year, between English and each of Czech, French, German, Hindi, and Russian.",
        "The Hindi translation tasks were new this year, providing a lesser resourced data condition on a challenging language pair.",
        "The system outputs for each task were evaluated both automatically and manually.",
        "1 The metrics task is reported in a separate paper (Mach?a?cek and Bojar, 2014).",
        "The human evaluation (?3) involves asking human judges to rank sentences output by anonymized systems.",
        "We obtained large numbers of rankings from researchers who contributed evaluations proportional to the number of tasks they entered.",
        "Last year, we dramatically increased the number of judgments, achieving much more meaningful rankings.",
        "This year, we developed a new ranking method that allows us to achieve the same with fewer judgments.",
        "The quality estimation task (?4) this year included sentence- and word-level subtasks: sentence-level prediction of 1-3 likert scores, sentence-level prediction of percentage of word edits necessary to fix a sentence, sentence-level prediction of post-editing time, and word-level prediction of scores at different levels of granularity (correct/incorrect, accuracy/fluency errors, and specific types of errors).",
        "Datasets were released with English-Spanish, English-German, Spanish-English and German-English news translations produced by 2-3 machine translation systems and, for some subtasks, a human translation.",
        "The medical translation task (?5) was introduced this year.",
        "Unlike the ?standard?",
        "translation task, the test sets come from the very specialized domain of medical texts.",
        "The aim of this task was not only domain adaptation but also the utilization of translation systems in a larger scenario, namely cross-lingual information retrieval (IR).",
        "Extrinsic evaluation in an IR setting was a part of this task (on the other hand, manual evaluation of translation quality was not carried out).",
        "The primary objectives of WMT are to evaluate the state of the art in machine translation, to disseminate common test sets and public training data with published performance numbers, and to refine evaluation and estimation methodologies for machine translation.",
        "As before, all of the data, 12 translations, and collected human judgments are publicly available.",
        "2 We hope these datasets serve as a valuable resource for research into statistical machine translation and automatic evaluation or prediction of translation quality.",
        "2 Overview of the Translation Task The recurring task of the workshop examines translation between English and other languages.",
        "As in the previous years, the other languages include German, French, Czech and Russian.",
        "We dropped Spanish and added Hindi this year.",
        "From a linguistic point of view, Spanish poses similar problems as French, making its prior inclusion less valuable.",
        "Hindi is not only interesting since it is a more distant language than the European languages we include, but also because we have much less training data, thus forcing researchers to deal with low resource conditions, but also providing them with a language pair that does not suffer from the computational complexities of having to deal with massive amounts of training data.",
        "We created a test set for each language pair by translating newspaper articles and provided training data.",
        "2.1 Test data The test data for this year's task was selected from news stories from online sources, as before.",
        "How-ever, we changed our method to create the test sets.",
        "In previous years, we took equal amounts of source sentences from all six languages involved (around 500 sentences each), and translated them into all other languages.",
        "While this produced a multi-parallel test corpus that could be also used for language pairs (such as Czech-Russian) that we did not include in the evaluation, it did suffer from artifacts from the larger distance between source and target sentences.",
        "Most test sentences involved the translation a source sentence that was translated from a their language into a target sentence (which was compared against a translation from that third language as well).",
        "Questions have been raised, if the evaluation of, say, French-English translation is best served when testing on sentences that have been originally written in, say, Czech.",
        "For discussions about trans-lationese please for instance refer to Koppel and Ordan (2011).",
        "2 http://statmt.org/wmt14/results.html This year, we took about 1500 English sentences and translated them into the other 5 lan-guages, and then additional 1500 sentences from each of the other languages and translated them into English.",
        "This gave us test sets of about 3000 sentences for our English-X language pairs, which have been either written originally written in English and translated into X, or vice versa.",
        "The composition of the test documents is shown in Table 1.",
        "The stories were translated by the professional translation agency Capita, funded by the EU Framework Programme 7 project MosesCore, and by Yandex, a Russian search engine company.",
        "3 All of the translations were done directly, and not via an intermediate language.",
        "2.2 Training data As in past years we provided parallel corpora to train translation models, monolingual corpora to train language models, and development sets to tune system parameters.",
        "Some training corpora were identical from last year (Eu- roparl 4 , United Nations, French-English 10 9 cor-pus, CzEng, Common Crawl, Russian-English Wikipedia Headlines provided by CMU), some were updated (Russian-English parallel data provided by Yandex, News Commentary, monolingual data), and a new corpus was added (Hindi- English corpus, Bojar et al. (2014)), Hindi-English Wikipedia Headline corpus).",
        "Some statistics about the training materials are given in Figure 1.",
        "2.3 Submitted systems We received 143 submissions from 23 institutions.",
        "The participating institutions and their entry names are listed in Table 2; each system did not necessarily appear in all translation tasks.",
        "We also included four commercial off-the-shelf MT systems and four online statistical MT systems, which we anonymized.",
        "For presentation of the results, systems are treated as either constrained or unconstrained, depending on whether their models were trained only on the provided data.",
        "Since we do not know how they were built, these online and commercial systems are treated as unconstrained during the automatic and human evaluations.",
        "3 http://www.yandex.com/ 4 As of Fall 2011, the proceedings of the European Parliament are no longer translated into all official languages.",

        "Exploring word-level quality prediction at different levels of granularity Previous work on word-level predictions, e.g. (Bo- jar et al., 2013) has focused on prediction of automatically derived labels, generally due to practical considerations as the manual annotation is labour intensive.",

        "For example, only 10 out of more than 3,400 errors in the English-Spanish test set fall into the latter categories, while over 2,000 words are marked as unintelligible.",
        "By hierarchically grouping errors into coarser categories we aimed to find a compromise between data sparsity and the expressiveness of the labels.",
        "What marks a good compromise depends on the use case, which we do not specify here, and the quality of the finer grained predictions: if a system is able to predict even rare errors these may be grouped later if necessary.",
        "Overall, word-level error prediction seems to remain a challenging task as evidenced by the fact that many submissions were unable to beat a trivial baseline.",
        "We hypothesise that this is at least partially due to a mismatch in loss-functions used in training and testing.",

        "Thus, additional coarse grained annotations may be derived by automatic means.",
        "For example, mapping the multi-class predictions of the above system to coarser categories improves the F 1,ERR score in Table 17 from 35.08 to 37.02 but does not change the rank with respect to the other entries.",
        "The fact that coarse grained predictions seem not to be derived from the fine-grained ones leads us to believe that most participants treated the different granularities as independent classification tasks.",

        "Studying the effects of training and test datasets with mixed domains, language pairs and MT systems This year's shared task made available datasets for more than one language pair with the same or different types of annotation, 2-3 multiple MT systems (plus a human translation) per language pair, and out-of-domain test data (Tasks 1.1 and 2).",

        "For a relative comparison (although not all systems submitted results for all language pairs, which is especially true in Task 2), we observe in Task 1.1 that for all language pairs generally at least half of the systems did better than the baseline.",

        "Translations from all but the system of interest for the same source segment were used as pseudo-references.",
        "The submission significantly outperformed the baseline for all language pairs and did particularly well for Spanish-English and English-Spanish.",
        "An in depth analysis of Task 1.1's datasets on the difference in prediction performance between models built and applied for individual translation systems and models built and tested for all translations pooled together is presented in (Shah and Specia, 2014).",
        "Not surprisingly, the former models perform significantly better, with MAE scores ranging between 0.35 and 0.5 for different language pairs and MT systems, and significantly lower scores for models trained and tested on human translations only (MAE scores between 0.2 and 0.35 for different language pairs), against MAE scores ranging between 0.5 and 0.65 for models with pooled data.",
        "For Tasks 1.2 and 1.3, two submissions included English-Spanish data which had been produced by yet different MT systems (SHEF-lite and DFKI).",
        "While using these additional instances seemed attractive given the small number of instances available for these tasks, it is not clear what their contribution was.",
        "For example, with a reduced set of instances (only 400) from the combined sets, SHEF-lite/sparse performed significantly better than its variant SHEF-lite.",
        "Finally, with respect to out-of-domain (different 41 text domain and MT system) test data, for Task 1.1, none of the papers submitted included experiments.",
        "(Shah and Specia, 2014) applied the models trained on pooled datasets (as explained above) for each language pair to the out-of-domain test sets.",
        "The results were surprisingly positive, with average MAE score of 0.5, compared to the 0.50.65 range for in-domain data (see above).",
        "Further analysis is necessary to understand the reasons for that.",
        "In Task 2, the official training and test sets already include out-of-domain data because of the very small amount of in-domain data available, and thus is is hard to isolate the effect of this data on the results.",
        "Examining the effectiveness of quality prediction methods on human translations Datasets for Tasks 1.1 and 2 contain human trans-lations, in addition to the automatic translations from various MT systems.",
        "Predicting human translation quality is an area that has been largely unexplored.",
        "Previous work has looked into distinguishing human from machine translations (e.g. (Gamon et al., 2005)), but this problem setting is somehow artificial, and moreover arguably harder to solve nowadays given the higher general quality of current MT systems (Shah and Specia, 2014).",
        "Although human translations are obviously of higher quality in general, many segments are translated by MT systems with the same or similar levels of quality as human translation.",
        "This is particularly true for Task 2, since data had been previously categorised and only ?near misses?",
        "were selected for the word-level annotation, i.e., human and machine translations that were both nearly perfect in this case.",
        "While no distinction was made between human and machine translations in our tasks, we believe the mix of these two types of translations has had a negative impact in prediction performance.",
        "Intu-itively, one can expect errors in human translation to be more subtle, and hence more difficult to capture via standard quality estimation features.",
        "For example, an incorrect lexical choice (due to, e.g., ambiguity) which still fits the context and does not make the translation ungrammatical is unlikely to be captured.",
        "We hoped that participants would design features for this particular type of translation, but although linguistically motivated features have been exploited, they did not seem appropriate for human translations.",
        "It is interesting to mention the indirect use of human translations by USHEFF for Tasks 1.1-1.3: given a translation for a source segment, all other translations for the same segment were used as pseudo-references.",
        "Apart from when this translation was actually the human translation, the human translation was effectively used as a reference.",
        "While this reference was mixed with 23 other pseudo-references (other machine transla-tions) for the feature computations, these features led to significant gains in performance over the baseline features Scarton and Specia (2014).",
        "We believe that more investigation is needed for human translation quality prediction.",
        "Tasks dedicated to this type of data at both sentence- and word-level in the next editions of this shared task would be a possible starting point.",
        "The acquisition of such data is however much more costly, as it is arguably hard to find examples of low quality human translation, unless specific settings, such as translation learner corpora, are considered.",

        "The task is split into two sub-tasks: summary translation, focused on translation of sentences from summaries of medical ar-ticles, and query translation, focused on translation of queries entered by users into medical information search engines.",
        "In general, texts of specific domains and genres are characterized by the occurrence of special vocabulary and syntactic constructions which are rare or even absent in traditional (general-domain) training data and therefore difficult for MT.",

        "5.4 Participants A total of eight teams participated in the Medical Translation Task by submitting their systems to at least one subtask for one or more translation directions.",
        "A list of the participants is given in Table 24; we provide short descriptions of their systems in the following.",
        "CUNI was involved in the organization of the task, and their primary goal was to set up a baseline for both the subtasks and for all translation directions.",

        "Their systems are based on the Moses phrase-based toolkit and linear interpolation of in-domain and out-of-domain language models and phrase tables.",
        "The constrained/unconstrained systems differ in the training data only.",
        "The constrained ones are built using all allowed training data; the unconstrained ones take advantage of additional web-crawled monolingual data used for training of the language models, and additional parallel non-medical data from the PatTr and COPPA patent collections.",
        "DCU-Q submitted a system designed specifically for terminology translation in the query translation task for EN?FR and FR?EN.",
        "This system supports six terminology extraction methods and is able to detect rare word pairs including zero-appearance word pairs.",
        "It uses monotonic decoding with lattice inputs, avoiding unnecessary hypothesis expansions by the reordering model.",
        "DCU-S submitted a system to the FR?EN summary translation subtask only.",
        "The system is similar to DCU's system for patent translation (phrased-based using Moses) but adapted to translate medical summaries and reports.",
        "LIMSI took part in the summary translation subtask for English to French.Their primary submission uses a combination of two translation sys-tems: NCODE, based on bilingual n-gram translation models; and an on-the-fly estimation of the parameters of Moses along with a vector space model to perform domain adaptation.",
        "A continuous-space language model is also used in a post-processing step for each system.",
        "POSTECH submitted a phrase-based SMT system and query translation system for the DE?EN language pair in both subtasks.",
        "They analysed three types of query formation, generated query translation candidates using term-to-term dictionaries and a phrase-based system, and then scored them using a co-occurrence word frequency measure to select the best candidate.",
        "UEDIN applied the Moses phrase-based system to all language pairs and both subtasks.",
        "They used the hierarchical reordering model and the OSM feature, same as in UEDIN's news translation sys-tem, and applied compound splitting to German input.",
        "They used separate language models built on in-domain and out-of-domain data with linear interpolation.",
        "For all language pairs except CS-EN and DE-EN, they selected data for the translation model using modified Moore-Lewis filtering.",
        "For DE-EN and CS-EN, they concatenated all the supplied parallel training data.",
        "UM-DA submitted systems for all language pairs in the summary translation subtask based on a combination of different adaptation steps, namely domain-specific pre-processing, language model adaptation, translation model adaptation, numeric adaptation, and hyphenated word adaptation.",
        "Data for the domain-adapted language and translation models were selected using various data selection techniques.",
        "UM-WDA submitted systems for all language pairs in the summary translation subtask.",
        "Their systems are domain-adapted using web-crawled in-domain resources: bilingual dictionaries and monolingual data.",
        "The translation model and language model trained on the crawled data were interpolated with the best-performing language and translation model employed in the UM-DA systems.",

        "Some of the participants of the WMT Medical Task (three teams with five submissions in total) submitted translations of the queries (from Czech, German, and French) into English and these translations were used to query the CLEF 2013 eHealth Task 3 test collection using a state-of-the-art system based on a BM25 model, described in Pecina et al. (2014).",
        "Origi-nally, we asked for 10 best translations for each query, but only the best one were used for the evaluation.",
        "The results are provided in terms of standard IR evaluation measures: precision at a cut-off of 5 and 10 documents (P@5, P@10), normalized discounted cumulative gain (J?arvelin and Kek?al?ainen, 2002) at 5 and 10 documents (NDCG@5, NDCG@10), mean average precision (MAP) (Voorhees and Harman, 2005), precision reached after R documents retrieved, where R indicates the number of the relevant documents for each query in the entire collection (Rprec), binary preference (bpref) (Buckley and Voorhees, 2004), and number or relevant documents retrieved (rel).",
        "The cross-lingual results are also compared with the monolingual one (obtained by using the reference (English) translations of the test topics) to see how the system would perform if the queries were translated perfectly.",

        "Most submissions were based on systems participating in the standard Translation Task and trained on the provided data or its subsets CUNI provided baseline systems for all language pairs in both subtasks, which turned to be relatively strong for the query translation task, especially in translation to English, but only in terms of scores obtained on normalized and lowercased translations since their truecasing component did not perform well.",
        "In the summary translation subtask, the best overall results were achieved by the UEDIN team which won for DE?EN, EN?CS, and EN?FR, followed by the UM-DA team, which performed on par with UEDIN in all other translation.",
        "The unconstrained submissions in almost all cases did not outperform the results of the constrained submissions.",

        "In the query translation subtask, DCU-Q built a system designed specifically for terminology translation between French and English and outperformed all other participants in translation into English; however, the confidence intervals in the query translation task are much wider and most of the differences in scores of the automatic metrics are not statistically significant.",
        "The extrinsic evaluation in the cross-lingual information retrieval was conducted for translations into English only.",
        "CUNI provided the baselines for all directions, but other submissions were done for FR?EN only.",
        "Here, the winner is UEDIN, who outperformed both CUNI and DCU-Q, and their scores are very close to those obtained using the reference English translations.",
