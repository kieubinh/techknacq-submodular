        "The annual shared translation task organized within the ACL Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT) aims to evaluate the state of the art in machine translation for a variety of languages.",
        "We participate in the Russian to English translation direction.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Our baseline system as well as the experiments concerning the methods already discussed in literature are described in Section 2.",
        "In Section 3 we present an algorithm we use to transform the Russian sentence before translation.",
        "In Section 4 we discuss the results and conclude.",
        "2 Initial System Development We use all the Russian-English parallel data available in the constraint track and the Common Crawl English monolingual corpus.",
        "2.1 Baseline We use the phrase-based Moses statistical machine translation system (Koehn et al., 2007) with mostly default settings and a few changes (Borisov et al., 2013) made in the following steps.",
        "Data Preprocessing includes filtering out non Russian-English sentence pairs and correction of spelling errors.",
        "Phrase Table Smoothing uses Good-Turing scheme (Foster et al., 2006).",
        "Consensus Decoding selects the translation with minimum Bayes risk (Kumar and Byrne, 2004).",
        "Handling of UnknownWords comprises incorporation of proper names from Wiki Headlines parallel data provided by CMU 1 and transliteration.",
        "We improve the transliteration algorithm in Section 2.4.",
        "Note that unlike last year we do not use word alignments computed for the lemmatized word forms.",
        "2.2 Language Model We use 5-gram unpruned language model with modified Kneser-Ney discount estimated with KenLM toolkit (Heafield et al., 2013).",
        "2.3 Word alignment Word alignments are generated using the fast_align tool (Dyer et al., 2013), which is much faster than IBM Model 4 from MGIZA++ (Gao and Vogel, 2008) and outperforms the latter in terms of BLEU.",
        "Results are given in Table 1.",
        "2.4 Transliteration We employ machine transliteration to generate additional translation options for out-of-vocabulary 1 http://www.statmt.org/wmt14/ wiki-titles.tgz 66 MGIZA++ fast_align Run Time 22 h 14 m 2h 49 m Perplexity ?",

        "The transformation model we use is a transfeme based model (Duan and Hsu, 2011), which is analogous to translation model in phrase-based machine translation.",
        "Transformation units, or transfemes, are trained with Moses using the default settings.",
        "Decoding is very similar to beam search.",
        "We build a trie from the words in English monolingual corpus, and search in it, based on the transformation model.",
        "2.5 Operation Sequence Model The Operation Sequence N-gram Model (OSM) (Durrani et al., 2011) integrates reordering operations and lexical translations into a heterogeneous sequence of minimal translation units (MTUs) and learns a Markov model over it.",
        "Reordering decisions influence lexical selections and vice versa thus improving the translation model.",
        "We use OSM as a feature function in phrase-based SMT.",
        "Please, refer to (Durrani et al., 2013) for implementation details.",
        "3 Morphological Transformations Russian is a fusional synthetic language, meaning that the relations between words are redundant and encoded inside the words.",
        "Adjectives alter their form to reflect the gender, case, number and in some cases, animacy of the nouns, resulting in dozens of different word forms matching a single English word.",
        "An example is given in Table 2.",
        "Verbs in Russian are typically constructed from the morphemes corresponding to functional words in English (to, shall, will, was, were, has, have, had, been, etc.).",
        "This Russian phenomenon leads to two problems: data sparsity and high number of one-to-many alignments, which both may result in translation quality degradation.",

        "On the first step we employ in-house Russian morphological analyzer similar to Mys-tem (Segalovich, 2003) to convert each word (WORD) into a tuple containing its canonical form (LEMMA), part of speech tag (POS) and a set 67 Category Abbr.",

        "The full set of morphological transformations we use is given in Table 4.",
        "An example of applying the algorithm to a Russian sentence is given in Figure 1.",
        "3.3 Results The translation has been improved in several ways: Incorrect Use of Tenses happens quite often in statistical machine translation, which is especially vexing in simple cases such as asks instead of asked, explains instead of explain along with more difficult ones e.g. has increased instead of would increase.",
        "The proposed algorithm achieves considerable improvement, since it explicitly models tenses and all its relevant properties.",
        "Missing Articles is a common problem of most Russian-English translation systems, because there are no articles in Russian.",
