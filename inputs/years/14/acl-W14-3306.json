        "This paper describes the joint participation of the Instituto Polit?ecnico Nacional (IPN) and the Universitat Polit`ecnica de Valencia (UPV) in cooperation with Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R) on the 9th Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT 2014).",
        "In particular, our participation was in the English-to-Hindi translation task.",
        "Our baseline system is an standard phrase-based SMT system built with Moses (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "Starting from this system we propose to introduce a source-context feature function inspired by previous works (R. Costa-juss`a and Banchs, 2011; Banchs and Costa-juss`a, 2011).",
        "The main novelty of this work is that the source-context feature is computed in a new deep representation.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents the motivation of this semantic feature and the description of how the source context feature function is added to Moses.",
        "Section 3 explains how both the latent semantic indexing and deep representation of sentences are used to better compute similarities among source contexts.",
        "Section 4 details the WMT experimental framework and results, which proves the relevance of the technique proposed.",
        "Finally, section 5 reports the main conclusions of this system description paper.",
        "2 Integration of a deep source-context feature function in Moses This section reports the motivation and description of the source-context feature function, together with the explanation of how it is integrated in Moses.",
        "2.1 Motivation and description Source context information in the phrase-based system is limited to the length of the translation units (phrases).",
        "Also, all training sentences contribute equally to the final translation.",
        "We propose a source-context feature function which measures the similarity between the input sentence and all training sentences.",
        "In this way, the translation unit should be extended from source|||target to source|||target|||trainingsentence, with the trainingsentence the sentence from which the source and target phrases were extracted.",
        "The measured similarity is used to favour those translation units that have been extracted from training sentences that are similar to the current sentence to be translated and to penalize those translation units that have been extracted from unrelated or dissimilar training sentences as shown in Figure 2.1.",
        "In the proposed feature, sentence similarity is measured by means of the cosine distance in a reduced dimension vector-space model, which is constructed either by means of standard latent semantic analysis or using deep representation as de-cribed in section 3.",

Costa-juss`a and Banchs, 2011; Banchs and Costa-juss`a, 2011), the value of the proposed source context similarity feature depends on each individual input sentence to be translated by the system.",
        "We are computing the similarity between the source input sentence and all the source training sentences.",
        "This definition implies the feature function depends on the input sentence to be translated.",
        "To implement this requirement, we followed our previous implementation of an off-line version of the proposed methodology, which, although very inefficient in the practice, allows us to evaluate the impact of the source-context feature on a state-of-the-art phrase-based translation system.",
        "This practical implementation follows the next procedure: 1.",
        "Two sentence similarity matrices are com-puted: one between sentences in the development and training sets, and the other between sentences in the test and training datasets.",
        "2.",
        "Each matrix entry m ij should contain the similarity score between the i th sentence in the training set and the j th sentence in the development (or test) set.",
        "3.",
        "For each sentence s in the test and development sets, a phrase pair list L S of all potential phrases that can be used during decoding is extracted from the aligned training set.",
        "4.",
        "The corresponding source-context similarity values are assigned to each phrase in lists L S according to values in the corresponding similarity matrices.",
        "5.",
        "Each phrase list L S is collapsed into a phrase table T S by removing repetitions (when removing repeated entries in the list, the largest value of the source-context similarity feature is retained).",
        "6.",
        "Each phrase table is completed by adding standard feature values (which are computed in the standard manner).",
        "7.",
        "Moses is used on a sentence-per-sentence ba-sis, using a different translation table for each development (or test) sentence.",
        "3 Representation of Sentences We represent the sentences of the source language in the latent space by means of linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques.",
        "Such models can be seen as topic models where the low-dimensional embedding of the sentences represent conditional latent topics.",
        "3.1 Deep Autoencoders The non-linear dimensionality reduction technique we employ is based on the concept of deep learning, specifically deep autoencoders.",
        "Autoencoders are three-layer networks (input layer, hidden layer and output layer) which try to learn an identity function.",
        "In the neural network representation of autoencoder (Rumelhart et al., 1986), the visible layer corresponds to the input layer and hidden layer corresponds to the latent features.",
        "The autoencoder tries to learn an abstract representation of the data in the hidden layer in such a way that minimizes reconstruction error.",
        "When the dimension of the hidden layer is sufficiently small, autoencoder is able to generalise and derive powerful low-dimensional representation of data.",
        "We consider bag-of-words representation of text sentences where the visible layer is binary feature vector (v) where v i corresponds to the presence or absence of i th word.",
        "We use binary restricted Boltzmann machines to construct an autoencoder as shown in (Hinton et al., 2006).",
        "Latent representation of the input sentence can be obtained as shown below: p(h|v) = ?",
        "(W ?",
        "v + b) (1) where W is the symmetric weight matrix between visible and hidden layer and b is hidden layer bias vector and ?",
        "(x) is sigmoid logistic function 1/(1 + exp(?x)).",
        "80 Autoencoders with single hidden layer do not have any advantage over linear methods like PCA (Bourlard and Kamp, 1988), hence we consider deep autoencoder by stacking multiple RBMs on top of each other (Hinton and Salakhut-dinov, 2006).",
        "The autoencoders have always been difficult to train through back-propagation until greedy layerwise pre-training was found (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006; Hinton et al., 2006; Ben-gio et al., 2006).",
        "The pre-training initialises the network parameters in such a way that fine-tuning them through back-propagation becomes very effective and efficient (Erhan et al., 2010).",
        "3.2 Latent Semantic Indexing Linear dimensionality reduction technique, latent semantic indexing (LSI) is used to represent sentences in abstract space (Deerwester et al., 1990).",
        "The term-sentence matrix (X) is created where x ij denotes the occurrence of i th term in j th sentence.",
        "Matrix X is factorized using singular value decomposition (SVD) method to obtain top m principle components and the sentences are represented in this m dimensional latent space.",
        "4 Experiments This section describes the experiments carried out in the context of WMT 2014.",
        "For English-Hindi the parallel training data was collected by Charles University and consisted of 3.6M English words and 3.97M Hindi words.",
        "There was a monolingual corpus for Hindi comming from different sources which consisted of 790.8M Hindi words.",
        "In ad-dition, there was a development corpus of news data translated specifically for the task which consisted of 10.3m English words and 10.1m Hindi words.",
        "For internal experimentation we built a test set extracted from the training set.",
        "We selected randomly 429 sentences from the training corpus which appeared only once, removed them from training and used them as internal test set.",
        "Monolingual Hindi corpus was used to build a larger language model.",
        "The language model was computed doing an interpolation of the language model trained on the Hindi part of the bilingual corpus (3.97M words) and the language model trained on the monolingual Hindi corpus (790.8M words).",
        "Interpolation was optimised in the development set provided by the organizers.",
        "Both language models interpolated were 5-grams using Kneser-Ney smoothing.",
        "The preprocessing of the corpus was done with the standard tools from Moses.",
        "English was low-ercased and tokenized.",
        "Hindi was tokenized with the simple tokenizer provided by the organizers.",
        "We cleaned the corpus using standard parameters (i.e. we keep sentences between 1 and 80 words of length).",
        "For training, we used the default Moses op-tions, which include: the grow-diag-final and word alignment symmetrization, the lexicalized reordering, relative frequencies (conditional and posterior probabilities) with phrase discounting, lexical weights and phrase bonus for the translation model (with phrases up to length 10), a language model (see details below) and a word bonus model.",
        "Optimisation was done using the MERT algorithm available in Moses.",
        "Optimisation is slow because of the way integration of the feature function is done that it requires one phrase table for each input sentence.",
        "During translation, we dropped unknown words and used the option of minimum bayes risk decoding.",
        "Postprocessing consisted in de-tokenizing Hindi using the standard detokenizer of Moses (the English version).",
        "4.1 Autoencoder training The architecture of autoencoder we consider was n-500-128-500-n where n is the vocabulary size.",
        "The training sentences were stemmed, stopwords were removed and also the terms with sentences frequency 1 less than 20 were also removed.",
        "This resulted in vocabulary size n=7299.",
        "The RBMs were pretrained using Contrastive Divergence (CD) with step size 1 (Hinton, 2002).",
        "After pretraining, the RBMs were stacked on top of each other and unrolled to create deep autoencoder (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006).",
        "During the fine-tuning stage, we backpropagated the reconstruction error to update network parameters.",
        "The size of mini-batches during pretraining and fine-tuning were 25 and 100 respectively.",
        "Weight decay was used to prevent overfitting.",
        "Addition-ally, in order to encourage sparsity in the hidden units, Kullback-Leibler sparsity regularization was used.",
        "We used GPU 2 based implementation of autoencoder to train the models which took around 4.5 hours for full training.",
        "1 total number of training sentences in which the term appears 2 NVIDIA GeForce GTX Titan with Memory 5 GiB and 2688 CUDA cores 81 4.2 Results Table 1 shows the improvements in terms of BLEU of adding deep context over the baseline system for English-to-Hindi (En2Hi) over development and test sets.",
        "Adding source-context information using deep learning outperforms the latent semantic analysis methodology.",
        "En2Hi Dev Test baseline 9.42 14.99 +lsi 9.83 15.12 +deep context 10.40 ?",

        "Table 1: BLEU scores for En2Hi translation task.. ?",
        "depicts statistical significance (p-value<0.05).",
        "Our source-context feature function may be more discriminative in a task like English-to-Hindi where the target language has a larger vocabulary than the source one.",
        "Table 2 shows an example of how the translation is improving in terms of lexical semantics which is the goal of the methodology presented in the paper.",
        "The most frequent sense of word cry is ronA, which literally means ?to cry?",
        "while the example in Table 2 refers to the sense of cry as cFK, which means to scream.",
        "Our method could identify the context and hence the source context feature (scf ) of the unit cry|||cFK is higher than for the unit scf (cry|||ronA) as shown in Table 3 and for this particular input sentence.",
        "5 Conclusion This paper reports the IPN-UPV participation in the WMT 2014 Evaluation Campaign.",
        "The system is Moses-based with an additional feature function based on deep learning.",
        "This feature function introduces source-context information in the standard Moses system by adding the information of how similar is the input sentence to the different training sentences.",
