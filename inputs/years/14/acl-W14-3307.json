        "This paper describes the KIT-LIMSI system for the Shared Task of the ACL 2014 Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation.",
        "The system participates in the German-to-English translation task.",
        "It consists of two main components.",
        "First, a k-best list is generated using a phrase-based machine translation system.",
        "This system will be described in Section 2.",
        "Afterwards, the k-best list is reranked using SOUL (Structured OUt-put Layer) models.",
        "Thereby, a neural network language model (Le et al., 2011), as well as several translation models (Le et al., 2012a) are used.",
        "A detailed description of these models can be found in Section 3.",
        "While the translation system uses phrase pairs, the SOUL translation model uses tuples as described in the n-gram approach (Mari?no et al., 2006).",
        "We describe the integration of the SOUL models into the translation system in Section 3.2.",
        "Section 4 summarizes the experimental results and compares two different tuning al-gorithms: Minimum Error Rate Training (Och, 2003) and k-best Batch Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (Cherry and Foster, 2012).",
        "2 Baseline system The KIT translation system is an in-house implementation of the phrase-based approach and includes a pre-ordering step.",
        "This system is fully described in Vogel (2003).",
        "To train translation models, the provided Eu-roparl, NC and Common Crawl parallel corpora are used.",
        "The target side of those parallel corpora, the News Shuffle corpus and the GigaWord corpus are used as monolingual training data for the different language models.",
        "Optimization is done with Minimum Error Rate Training as described in Venugopal et al. (2005), using newstest2012 and newstest2013 as development and test data, respectively.",
        "Compound splitting (Koehn and Knight, 2003) is performed on the source side (German) of the corpus before training.",
        "Since the web-crawled Common Crawl corpus is noisy, this corpus is first filtered using an SVM classifier as described in Mediani et al. (2011).",
        "The word alignment is generated using the GIZA++ Toolkit (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "Phrase extraction and scoring is done using the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "Phrase pair probabilities are computed using modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Foster et al., 2006).",
        "We apply short-range reorderings (Rottmann and Vogel, 2007) and long-range reorderings (Niehues and Kolss, 2009) based on part-of-speech tags.",
        "The POS tags are generated using the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994).",
        "Rewriting rules 84 based on POS sequences are learnt automatically to perform source sentence reordering according to the target language word order.",
        "The long-range reordering rules are further applied to the training corpus to create reordering lattices to extract the phrases for the translation model.",
        "In addition, a tree-based reordering model (Herrmann et al., 2013) trained on syntactic parse trees (Rafferty and Manning, 2008; Klein and Manning, 2003) is applied to the source sentence.",
        "In addition to these pre-reordering models, a lexicalized reordering model (Koehn et al., 2005) is applied during decoding.",
        "Language models are trained with the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) using modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Chen and Goodman, 1996).",
        "The system uses a 4-gram word-based language model trained on all monolingual data and an additional language model trained on automatically selected data (Moore and Lewis, 2010).",
        "The system further applies a language model based on 1000 automatically learned word classes using the MKCLS algorithm (Och, 1999).",
        "In addition, a bilingual language model (Niehues et al., 2011) is used as well as a discriminative word lexicon (DWL) using source context to guide the word choices in the target sentence.",
        "3 SOUL models for statistical machine translation Neural networks, working on top of conventional n-gram back-off language models (BOLMs), have been introduced in (Bengio et al., 2003; Schwenk, 2007) as a potential means to improve discrete language models.",
        "The SOUL model (Le et al., 2011) is a specific neural network architecture that allows us to estimate n-gram models using large vocabularies, thereby making the training of large neural network models feasible both for target language models and translation models (Le et al., 2012a).",
        "3.1 SOUL translation models While the integration of SOUL target language models is straightforward, SOUL translation models rely on a specific decomposition of the joint probability P (s, t) of a sentence pair, where s is a sequence of I reordered source words (s 1 , ..., s I ) 1 1 In the context of the n-gram translation model, (s, t) thus denotes an aligned sentence pair, where the source words are reordered.",
        "and t contains J target words (t 1 , ..., t J ).",
        "In the n-gram approach (Mari?no et al., 2006; Crego et al., 2011), this segmentation is a by-product of source reordering, and ultimately derives from initial word and phrase alignments.",
        "In this frame-work, the basic translation units are tuples, which are analogous to phrase pairs, and represent a matching u = (s, t) between a source phrase s and a target phrase t. Using the n-gram assumption, the joint probability of a segmented sentence pair using L tupels decomposes as: P (s, t) = L ?",
        "i=1 P (u i |u i?1 , ..., u i?n+1 ) (1) A first issue with this decomposition is that the elementary units are bilingual pairs.",
        "Therefore, the underlying vocabulary and hence the number of parameters can be quite large, even for small translation tasks.",
        "Due to data sparsity issues, such models are bound to face severe estimation problems.",
        "Another problem with Equation (1) is that the source and target sides play symmetric roles, whereas the source side is known, and the target side must be predicted.",
        "To overcome some of these issues, the n-gram probability in Equation (1) can be factored by first decomposing tuples in two (source and target) parts, and then decomposing the source and target parts at the word level.",
        "Let s k i denote the k th word of source part of the tuple s i .",
        "Let us consider the example of Figure 1, s 1 11 corresponds to the source word nobel, s 4 11 to the source word paix, and similarly t 2 11 is the target word peace.",
        "We finally define h n?1 (t k i ) as the sequence of the n?1 words preceding t k i in the target sentence, and h n?1 (s k i ) as the n?1 words preceding s k i in the reordered source sentence: in Figure 1, h 3 (t 2 11 ) thus refers to the three word context receive the nobel associated with the target word peace.",
        "Using these notations, Equation 1 can be rewritten as: P (s, t) = L ?",
        "i=1 [ |t i | ?",
        "k=1 P ( t k i |h n?1 (t k i ), h n?1 (s 1 i+1 ) ) ?",
        "|s i | ?",
        "k=1 P ( s k i |h n?1 (t 1 i ), h n?1 (s k i ) ) ] (2) This decomposition relies on the n-gram assump-tion, this time at the word level.",

        "Figure 1: Extract of a French-English sentence pair segmented into bilingual units.",
        "The original (org) French sentence appears at the top of the figure, just above the reordered source s and the target t. The pair (s, t) decomposes into a sequence of L bilingual units (tuples) u 1 , ..., u L .",
        "Each tuple u i contains a source and a target phrase: s i and t i .",
        "model estimates the joint probability of a sentence pair using two sliding windows of length n, one for each language; however, the moves of these windows remain synchronized by the tuple segmentation.",
        "Moreover, the context is not limited to the current phrase, and continues to include words in adjacent phrases.",
        "Equation (2) involves two terms that will be further denoted as TrgSrc and Src, respectively P ( t k i |h n?1 (t k i ), h n?1 (s 1 i+1 ) ) and P ( s k i |h n?1 (t 1 i ), h n?1 (s k i ) ) .",
        "It is worth noticing that the joint probability of a sentence pair can also be decomposed by considering the following two terms: P ( s k i |h n?1 (s k i ), h n?1 (t 1 i+1 ) ) and P ( t k i |h n?1 (s 1 i ), h n?1 (t k i ) ) .",
        "These two terms will be further denoted by SrcTrg and Trg.",
        "There-fore, adding SOUL translation models means that 4 scores are added to the phrase-based systems.",
        "3.2 Integration During the training step, the SOUL translation models are trained as described in (Le et al., 2012a).",
        "The main changes concern the inference step.",
        "Given the computational cost of computing n-gram probabilities with neural network models, a solution is to resort to a two-pass approach: the first pass uses a conventional system to produce a k-best list (the k most likely hypotheses); in the second pass, probabilities are computed by the SOUL models for each hypothesis and added as new features.",
        "Then the k-best list is reordered according to a combination of all features including these new features.",
        "In the following experiments, we use 10-gram SOUL models to rescore 300- best lists.",
        "Since the phrase-based system described in Section 2 uses source reordering, the decoder was modified in order to generate k-best lists that contain necessary word alignment information between the reordered source sentence and its associated target hypothesis.",
        "The goal is to recover the information that is illustrated in Figure 1 and to apply the n-gram decomposition of a sentence pair.",
        "These (target and bilingual) neural network models produce scores for each hypothesis in the k-best list; these new features, along with the features from the baseline system, are then provided to a new phase which runs the traditional Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT ) (Och, 2003), or a recently proposed k-best Batch Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (KBMIRA ) (Cherry and Fos-ter, 2012) for tuning purpose.",
        "The SOUL models used for this year's evaluation are similar to those described in Allauzen et al. (2013) and Le et al. (2012b).",
        "However, since compared to these evaluations less parallel data is available for the German-to-English task, we use smaller vocabularies of about 100K words.",
        "4 Results We evaluated the SOUL models on the German-to-English translation task using two systems to generate the k-best lists.",
        "The first system used all models of the baseline system except the DWL model and the other one used all models.",
        "Table 1 summarizes experimental results in terms of BLEU scores when the tuning is performed using KBMIRA.",
        "As described in Section 3, the probability of a phrase pair can be decomposed into products of words?",
        "probabilities in 2 different ways: we can first estimate the probability of words in the source phrase given the context, and then the probability of the target phrase given its associated source phrase and context words (see Equation (2)); or inversely we can generate the target side before the source side.",

        "2 new features into the k-best list, and the latter by adding Trg and SrcTrg scores.",
        "These 2 methods correspond respectively to the Translation ts and Translation st lines in the Table 1.",
        "The 4 translation models may also be added simultaneously (All Translations).",
        "The first line gives baseline results without SOUL models, while the Target line shows results in adding only SOUL language model.",
        "The last line (All SOUL models) shows the results for adding all neural network models into the baseline systems.",
        "As evident in Table 1, using the SOUL translation models yields generally better results than using the SOUL target language model, yielding about 0.2 BLEU point differences on dev and test sets.",
        "We can therefore assume that the SOUL translation models provide richer information that, to some extent, covers that contained in the neural network language model.",
        "Indeed, these 4 translation models take into account not only lexical probabilities of translating target words given source words (or in the inverse order), but also the probabilities of generating words in the target side (Trg model) as does a language model, with the same context length over both source and target sides.",
        "It is therefore not surprising that adding the SOUL language model along with all translation models (the last line in the table) does not give significant improvement compared to the other configurations.",
        "The different ways of using the SOUL translation models perform very similarly.",
        "Table 2 summarizes the results using MERT instead of KBMIRA.",
        "We can observe that using KBMIRA results in 0.1 to 0.2 BLEU point improvements compared to MERT.",
        "Moreover, this impact becomes more important when more features are considered (the last line when all 5 neural network models are added into the baseline systems).",
        "In short, the use of neural network models yields up to 0.6 BLEU improvement on the DWL sys-tem, and a 0.8 BLEU gain on the system without DWL.",
        "Unfortunately, the experiments with KBMIRA were carried out after the the submission date.",
        "Therefore the submitted system corresponds to the last line of table 2 indicated in bold.",
        "5 Conclusion We presented a system with two main features: a phrase-based translation system which uses pre-reordering and the integration of SOUL target language and translation models.",
        "Although the translation performance of the baseline system is already very competitive, the rescoring by SOUL models improve the performance significantly.",
        "In the rescoring step, we used a continuous language model as well as four continuous translation mod-87 els.",
        "When combining the different SOUL models, the translation models are observed to be more important in increasing the translation performance than the language model.",
        "Moreover, we observe a slight benefit to use KBMIRA instead of the standard MERT tuning algorithm.",
        "It is worth noticing that using KBMIRA improves the performance but also reduces the variance of the final results.",
        "As future work, the integration of the SOUL translation models could be improved in different ways.",
        "For SOUL translation models, there is a mismatch between translation units used during the training step and those used by the decoder.",
        "The former are derived using the n-gram-based approach, while the latter use the conventional phrase extraction heuristic.",
        "We assume that reducing this mismatch could improve the overall performance.",
        "This can be achieved for instance using forced decoding to infer a segmentation of the training data into translation units.",
        "Then the SOUL translation models can be trained using this segmentation.",
        "For the SOUL target language model, in these experiments we only used the English part of the parallel data for training.",
        "Results may be improved by including all the monolingual data.",
