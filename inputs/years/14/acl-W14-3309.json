        "Abstract",
        "This paper describes the University of Ed-inburgh's (UEDIN) phrase-based submissions to the translation and medical translation shared tasks of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT).",
        "We participated in all language pairs.",
        "We have improved upon our 2013 system by i) using generalized represen-tations, specifically automatic word clusters for translations out of English, ii) using unsupervised character-based models to translate unknown words in Russian-English and Hindi-English pairs, iii) synthesizing Hindi data from closely-related Urdu data, and iv) building huge language on the common crawl corpus.",
        "1 Translation Task Our baseline systems are based on the setup described in (Durrani et al., 2013b) that we used for the Eighth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (Bojar et al., 2013).",
        "The notable features of these systems are described in the following section.",
        "The experiments that we carried out for this year's translation task are described in the following sections.",
        "1.1 Baseline We trained our systems with the following set-tings: a maximum sentence length of 80, grow-diag-final-and symmetrization of GIZA++ align-ments, an interpolated Kneser-Ney smoothed 5- gram language model with KenLM (Heafield, 2011) used at runtime, hierarchical lexicalized reordering (Galley and Manning, 2008), a lexically-driven 5-gram operation sequence model (OSM) (Durrani et al., 2013a) with 4 count-based supportive features, sparse domain indicator, phrase length, and count bin features (Blunsom and Os-borne, 2008; Chiang et al., 2009), a distortion limit of 6, maximum phrase-length of 5, 100-best translation options, Minimum Bayes Risk decoding (Kumar and Byrne, 2004), Cube Pruning (Huang and Chiang, 2007), with a stack-size of 1000 during tuning and 5000 during test and the no-reordering-over-punctuation heuristic (Koehn and Haddow, 2009).",
        "We used POS and morphological tags as additional factors in phrase translation models (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) for German-English language pairs.",
        "We also trained target sequence models on the in-domain subset of the parallel corpus using Kneser-Ney smoothed 7-gram models.",
        "We used syntactic-preordering (Collins et al., 2005) and compound splitting (Koehn and Knight, 2003) for German-to-English systems.",
        "We used trivia tokenizer for tokenizing Hindi.",
        "The systems were tuned on a very large tuning set consisting of the test sets from 2008-2012, with a total of 13,071 sentences.",
        "We used newstest 2013 for the dev experiments.",
        "For Russian-English pairs news-test 2012 was used for tuning and for Hindi-English pairs, we divided the news-dev 2014 into two halves, used the first half for tuning and second for dev experiments.",
        "1.2 Using Generalized Word Representations We explored the use of automatic word clusters in phrase-based models (Durrani et al., 2014a).",
        "We computed the clusters with GIZA++'s mkcls (Och, 1999) on the source and target side of the parallel training corpus.",
        "Clusters are word classes that are optimized to reduce n-gram perplexity.",
        "By generating a cluster identifier for each output word, we are able to add an n-gram model 97 over these identifiers as an additional scoring function.",
        "The inclusion of such an additional factor is trivial given the factored model implementation (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) of Moses (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "The n-gram model is trained in the similar way as the regular language model.",
        "We trained domain-specific language models separately and then linearly interpolated them using SRILM with weights optimized on the tuning set (Schwenk and Koehn, 2008).",
        "We also trained OSM models over cluster-ids (?).",
        "The lexically driven OSM model falls back to very small context sizes of two to three operations due to data sparsity.",
        "Learning operation sequences over cluster-ids enables us to learn richer translation and reordering patterns that can generalize better in sparse data conditions.",
        "Table 1 shows gains from adding target LM and OSM models over cluster-ids.",

        "1.4 Synthesizing Hindi Data from Urdu Hindi and Urdu are closely related language pairs that share grammatical structure and have a large overlap in vocabulary.",
        "This provides a strong motivation to transform any Urdu-English parallel data into Hindi-English by translating the Urdu part into Hindi.",
        "We made use of the Urdu-English segment of the Indic multi-parallel corpus (Post et al., 2012) which contains roughly 87K sentence pairs.",
        "The Hindi-English segment of this corpus is a subset of parallel data made available for the translation task but is completely disjoint from the Urdu-English segment.",

        "98 et al., 2002).",
        "But we found this system to be useless for translating the Urdu part of Indic data due to domain mismatch and huge number of OOV words (approximately 310K tokens).",

        "This reduced the number of OOV tokens from 310K to approximately 50K.",
        "Transliteration: Urdu and Hindi are written in different scripts (Arabic and Devanagri respec-tively).",

        "We were able to extract around 2800 transliteration pairs.",
        "To learn a richer transliteration model, we additionally fed the interpolated phrase-table, as described above, to the transliteration miner.",
        "We were able to mine additional 21000 transliteration pairs and built a Urdu-Hindi character-based model from it.",
        "The transliteration module can be used to translate the 50K OOV words but previous research (Durrani et al., 2010; Nakov and Tiedemann, 2012) has shown that transliteration is useful for more than just translating OOV words when translating closely related language pairs.",
        "To fully capitalize on the large overlap in Hindi?Urdu vocabulary, we transliterated each word in the Urdu test-data into Hindi and produced a phrase-table with 100-best transliterations.",
        "The two synthesized (triangulated and transliterated) phrase-tables are then used along with the baseline Urdu-to-Hindi phrase-table in a log-linear model.",
