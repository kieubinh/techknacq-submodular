        "For this year's WMT shared translation task we built syntax-based systems for six language pairs: ?",
        "English-German ?",
        "German-English ?",
        "Czech-English ?",
        "Hindi-English ?",
        "French-English ?",
        "Russian-English As last year (Nadejde et al., 2013), our systems are based on the string-to-tree pipeline implemented in the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "We paid particular attention to the production of grammatical German, trying various parsers and incorporating target-side compound splitting and morphosyntactic constraints; for Hindi and Rus-sian, we employed the new Moses transliteration model to handle out-of-vocabulary words; and for German to English, we experimented with tree bi-narization, obtaining good results from right bina-rization.",
        "We also present our first syntax-based results for French-English, the scale of which defeated us last year.",
        "This year we were able to train a system using all available training data, a task that was made considerably easier through principled filtering of the tuning set.",
        "Although our system was not ready in time for human evaluation, we present BLEU scores in this paper.",
        "In addition to the five single-system submissions described here, we also contributed our English-German and German-English systems for use in the collaborative EU-BRIDGE system combination effort (Freitag et al., 2014).",
        "This paper is organised as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we describe the core setup that is common to all systems.",
        "In subsequent sections we describe language-pair specific variations and extensions.",
        "For each language pair, we present results for both the development test set (newstest2013 in most cases) and for the filtered test set (new- stest2014) that was provided after the system submission deadline.",
        "We refer to these as ?devtest?",
        "and ?test?, respectively.",
        "2 System Overview 2.1 Pre-processing The training data was normalized using the WMT normalize-punctuation.perl script then tokenized and truecased.",
        "Where the target language was English, we used the Moses tokenizer's -penn option, which uses a tokenization scheme that more closely matches that of the parser.",
        "For the English-German system we used the default Moses tokenization scheme, which is similar to that of the German parsers.",
        "For the systems that translate into English, we used the Berkeley parser (Petrov et al., 2006; Petrov and Klein, 2007) to parse the target-side of the training corpus.",
        "As we will describe in Section 3, we tried a variety of parsers for German.",
        "We did not perform any corpus filtering other than the standard Moses method, which removes 207 sentence pairs with dubious length ratios and sentence pairs where parsing fails for the target-side sentence.",
        "2.2 Translation Model Our translation grammar is a synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG) with phrase-structure labels on the target side and the generic non-terminal label X on the source side.",
        "The grammar was extracted from the word-aligned parallel data using the Moses implementation (Williams and Koehn, 2012) of the GHKM algorithm (Galley et al., 2004; Galley et al., 2006).",
        "For word alignment we used MGIZA++ (Gao and Vogel, 2008), a multi-threaded implementation of GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "Minimal GHKM rules were composed into larger rules subject to parameterized restrictions on size defined in terms of the resulting target tree fragment.",
        "A good choice of parameter settings depends on the annotation style of the target-side parse trees.",
        "We used the settings shown in Table 1, which were chosen empirically during the development of last years?",
        "systems: Parameter Value Rule depth 5 Node count 20 Rule size 5 Table 1: Parameter settings for rule composition.",
        "Further to the restrictions on rule composition, fully non-lexical unary rules were eliminated using the method described in Chung et al. (2011) and rules with scope greater than 3 (Hopkins and Langmead, 2010) were pruned from the translation grammar.",
        "Scope pruning makes parsing tractable without the need for grammar binariza-tion.",
        "2.3 Language Model We used all available monolingual data to train 5-gram language models.",
        "Language models for each monolingual corpus were trained using the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Chen and Goodman, 1998) and then interpolated using weights tuned to minimize perplexity on the development set.",
        "2.4 Feature Functions Our feature functions are unchanged from the previous two years.",
        "They include the n-gram language model probability of the derivation's target yield, its word count, and various scores for the synchronous derivation.",
        "Each grammar rule has a number of precomputed scores.",
        "For a grammar rule r of the form C ?",
        "?",
        "?, ?,??",
        "where C is a target-side non-terminal label, ?",
        "is a string of source terminals and non-terminals, ?",
        "is a string of target terminals and non-terminals, and ?",
        "is a one-to-one correspondence between source and target non-terminals, we score the rule according to the following functions: ?",
        "p (C, ?",
        "| ?,?)",
        "and p (?",
        "| C, ?,?",
        "), the direct and indirect translation probabilities.",
        "?",
        "p lex (?",
        "| ?)",
        "and p lex (?",
        "| ?",
        "), the direct and indirect lexical weights (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "?",
        "p pcfg (pi), the monolingual PCFG probability of the tree fragment pi from which the rule was extracted.",
        "?",
        "exp(?1/count(r)), a rule rareness penalty.",
        "?",
        "exp(1), a rule penalty.",
        "The main grammar and glue grammars have distinct penalty features.",
        "2.5 Tuning The feature weights were tuned using the Moses implementation of MERT (Och, 2003) for all systems except English-to-German, for which we used k-best MIRA (Cherry and Foster, 2012) due to the larger number of features.",
        "We used tuning sentences drawn from all of the previous years?",
        "test sets (except newstest2013, which was used as the development test set).",
        "In order to speed up the tuning process, we used subsets of the full tuning sets with sentence pairs up to length 30 (Max-30) and further applied a filtering technique to reduce the tuning set size to 2,000 sentence pairs for the language pairs involving German, French and Czech 1 .",
        "We also experimented with random subsets of size 2,000.",
        "For the filtering technique, we make the assumption that finding suitable weights for all the feature functions requires the optimizer to see a range of feature values and to see hypotheses that can partially match the reference translations in order to rank the hypotheses.",
        "For example, if a 1 For Russian and Hindi, the development sets are smaller and no filtering was applied.",
        "208 tuning example contains many out-of-vocabulary words or is difficult to translate for other reasons, this will result in low quality translation hypotheses and provide the system with little evidence for which features are useful to produce good translations.",
        "Therefore, we select high quality examples using a smooth version of sentence-BLEU computed on the 1-best output of a single decoder run on the development set.",
        "Standard sentence-BLEU tends to select short examples because they are more likely to have perfect n-gram matches with the reference translation.",
        "Very short sentence pairs are less informative for tuning but also tend to have more extreme source-target length ratios which can affect the weight of the word penalty.",
        "Thus, we penalize short examples by padding the decoder output with a fixed number of non-matching tokens 2 to the left and right before computing sentence-BLEU.",
        "This has the effect of reducing the precision of short sentences against the reference translation while affecting longer sentences proportionally less.",
        "Experiments on phrase-based systems have shown that the resulting tuning sets are of comparable diversity as randomly selected sets in terms of their feature vectors and maintain BLEU scores in comparison with tuning on the entire development set.",
        "Table 2 shows the size of the full tuning sets and the size of the subsets with up to length 30, Table 3 shows the results of tuning with different sets.",
        "Reducing the tuning sets to Max-30 results in a speed-up in tuning time but affects the performance on some of the devtest/test sets (mostly for Czech-English).",
        "However, tuning on the full set took more than 18 days using 12 cores for German-English which is not feasible when trying out several model variations.",
        "Further filtering these subsets to a size of 2,000 sentence pairs as described above maintains the BLEU scores in most cases and even improves the scores in some cases.",
        "This indicates that the quality of the selected examples is more important than the total number of tuning examples.",
        "However, the experiments with random subsets from Max-30 show that random selection also yields results which improve over the results with Max-30 in most cases, though are not always as good as with the filtered sets.",
        "3 The filtered tuning sets yield reasonable per-2 These can be arbitrary tokens that do not match any reference token.",
        "3 For random subsets from the full tuning set the performance was similar but resulted in standard deviations of up formance compared to the full tuning sets except for the German-English devtest set where performance drops by 0.5 BLEU 4 .",

        "Contrastive systems were built with other parsers: BitPar (Schmid, 2004), the German Stanford Parser (Rafferty and Manning, 2008), and the German Berkeley Parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007; Petrov and Klein, 2008).",
        "The set of syntactic labels provided by ParZu has been refined to reduce overgeneralization phenomena.",
        "Specifically, we disambiguate the labels ROOT (used for the root of a sentence, but also commas, punctuation marks, and sentence frag-ments), KON and CJ (coordinations of different constituents), and GMOD (pre- or postmodifying genitive modifier).",
        "to 0.36 across three random sets.",

        "We discriminatively learn non-terminal labels for unknown words using sparse features, rather than estimating a probability distribution of non-terminal labels from singleton statistics in the training corpus.",
        "We perform target-side compound splitting, using a hybrid method described by Fritzinger and Fraser (2010) that combines a finite-state morphology and corpus statistics.",
        "As finite-state morphology analyzer, we use Zmorge (Sennrich and Kunz, 2014).",
        "An original contribution of our experiments is a syntactic representation of split compounds which eliminates typical problems with target-side compound splitting, namely erroneous reorderings and compound merging.",
        "We represent split compounds as a syntactic tree with the last segment as head, preceded by a modifier.",
        "A modifier consists of an optional modifier, a segment and a (possibly empty) joining element.",
        "An example is shown in Figure 1.",
        "This hierarchical representation ensures that compounds can be easily merged in post-processing (by removing the spaces and special characters around joining ele-ments), and that no segments are placed outside of a compound in the translation.",
        "We use unification-based constraints to model morphological agreement within German noun phrases, and between subjects and verbs (Williams and Koehn, 2011).",
        "Additionally, we add constraints that operate on the internal tree structure of the translation hypotheses, to enforce several syntactic constraints that were frequently violated in the baseline system: ?",

        "In brief, this is an unsupervised method that i) uses EM to induce a corpus of transliteration examples from the parallel training data; ii) learns a monotone character-level phrase-based SMT model from the transliteration corpus; and iii) substitutes transliterations for OOVs in the system output by using the monolingual language model and other features to select between transliteration candidates.",
