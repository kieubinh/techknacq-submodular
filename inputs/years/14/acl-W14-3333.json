        "Automatic metrics, such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), are widely used in machine translation (MT) as a substitute for human evaluation.",
        "Such metrics commonly take the form of an automatic comparison of MT output text with one or more human reference translations.",
        "Small differences in automatic metric scores can be difficult to inter-pret, however, and statistical significance testing provides a way of estimating the likelihood that a score difference has occurred simply by chance.",
        "For several metrics, such as BLEU, standard significance tests cannot be applied due to scores not comprising the mean of individual sentence scores, justifying the use of randomized methods.",
        "Bootstrap resampling was one of the early randomized methods proposed for statistical significance testing of MT (Germann, 2003; Och, 2003; Kumar and Byrne, 2004; Koehn, 2004), to assess for a pair of systems how likely a difference in BLEU scores occurred by chance.",
        "Empirical tests detailed in Koehn (2004) show that even for test sets as small as 300 translations, BLEU confidence intervals can be computed as accurately as if they had been computed on a test set 100 times as large.",
        "Approximate randomization was subsequently proposed as an alternate to bootstrap resampling (Riezler and Maxwell, 2005).",
        "Theoretically speaking, approximate randomization has an advantage over bootstrap resampling, in that it does not make the assumption that samples are representative of the populations from which they are drawn.",
        "Both methods require some adaptation in order to be used for the purpose of MT evalua-tion, such as combination with an automatic met-ric, and therefore it cannot be taken for granted that approximate randomization will be more accurate in practice.",
        "Within MT, approximate randomization for the purpose of statistical testing is also less common.",
        "Riezler and Maxwell (2005) provide a comparison of approximate randomization with bootstrap resampling (distinct from paired bootstrap resam-pling), and conclude that since approximate randomization produces higher p-values for a set of apparently equally-performing systems, it more conservatively concludes statistically significant differences, and recommend preference of approximate randomization over bootstrap resampling for MT evaluation.",
        "Conclusions drawn from experiments provided in Riezler and Maxwell (2005) are oft-cited, with experiments interpreted as evidence that bootstrap resampling is overly optimistic in reporting significant differences (Riezler and Maxwell, 2006; Koehn and Monz, 2006; Galley and Manning, 2008; Green et al., 2010; Monz, 2011; Clark et al., 2011).",
        "Our contribution in this paper is to revisit statistical significance tests in MT ?",
        "namely, bootstrap resampling, paired bootstrap resampling and 266 approximate randomization ?",
        "and find problems with the published formulations.",
        "We redress these issues, and apply the tests in statistical testing of two language pairs.",
        "Using human judgments of translation quality, we find only very minor differences in significance levels across the three tests, challenging claims made in the literature about relative merits of tests.",
        "2 Revisiting Statistical Significance Tests for MT Evaluation First, we revisit the formulations of bootstrap resampling and approximate randomization algorithms as presented in Riezler and Maxwell (2005).",
        "At first glance, both methods appear to be two-tailed tests, with the null hypothesis that the two systems perform equally well.",
        "To facilitate a two-tailed test, absolute values of pseudo-statistics are computed before locating the absolute value of the actual statistic (original difference in scores).",
        "Using absolute values of pseudo-statistics is not problematic in the approximate randomization algorithm, and results in a reasonable two-tailed significance test.",
        "However, the bootstrap algorithm they provide uses an additional shift-to-zero method of simulating the null hypothesis.",
        "The way in which this shift-to-zero and absolute values of pseudo-statistics are applied is non-standard.",
        "Combining shift-to-zero and absolute values of pseudo-statistics results in all pseudo-statistics that fall below the mean pseudo-statistic to be omitted from computation of counts later used to compute p-values.",
        "The version of the bootstrap algorithm, as provided in the pseudo-code, is effectively a one-tailed test, and since this does not happen in the approximate randomization algorithm, experiments appear to compare p-values from a one-tailed bootstrap test directly with those of a two-tailed approximate randomization test.",
        "This inconsistency is not recog-nized, however, and p-values are compared as if both tests are two-tailed.",
        "A better comparison of p-values would first require doubling the values of the one-sided boot-strap, leaving those of the two-sided approximate randomization algorithm as-is.",
        "The results of the two tests on this basis are extremely close, and in fact, in two out of the five comparisons, those of the bootstrap would have marginally higher p-values than those of approximate randomization.",
        "As such, it is conceivable to conclude that the experiments actually show no substantial difference in Type I error between the two tests, which is consistent with results published in other fields of research (Smucker et al., 2007).",
        "We also note that the pseudo-code contains an unconventional computation of mean pseudo-statistics, ?",
        "B , for shift-to-zero.",
        "Rather than speculate over whether these issues with the original paper were simply presentational glitches or the actual basis of the experiments reported on in the paper, we present a normalized version of the two-sided bootstrap algorithm in Figure 1, and report on the results of our own experiments in Section 4.",
        "We compare this method with approximate randomization and also paired bootstrap resampling (Koehn, 2004), which is widely used in MT evaluation.",
        "We carry out evaluation over a range of MT systems, not only including pairs of systems that perform equally well, but also pairs of systems for which one system performs marginally better than the other.",
        "This enables evaluation of not only Type I error, but the overall accuracy of the tests.",
        "We carry out a large-scale human evaluation of all WMT 2012 shared task participating systems for two language pairs, and collect sufficient human judgments to facilitate statistical significance tests.",
        "This human evaluation data then provides a gold-standard against which to compare randomized tests.",
        "Since all randomized tests only function in combination with an automatic MT evaluation metric, we present results of each randomized test across four different MT metrics.",
