        "This dataset consists of 110 systems?",
        "outputs and 10 reference translations in 10 translation directions (English from and into Czech, French, German, Hindi and Russian).",
        "For most of the translation directions each system's output and the reference translation contain 3003 sentences.",
        "For more details please see the WMT14 overview paper (Bojar et al., 2014).",
        "2.1 Manual MT Quality Judgements During the WMT14 Translation Task, a large scale manual annotation was conducted to compare the systems.",
        "We used these collected human judgements for the evalution of the automatic metrics.",
        "The participants in the manual annotation were asked to evaluate system outputs by ranking translated sentences relative to each other.",
        "For each source segment that was included in the procedure, the annotator was shown the outputs of five systems to which he or she was supposed to assign ranks.",
        "Ties were allowed.",
        "These collected rank labels for each five-tuple of systems were then interpreted as 10 pairwise comparisons of systems and used to assign each system a score that reflects how high that system was usually ranked by the annotators.",
        "Please see the WMT14 overview paper for details on how this score is computed.",

        "You can find the system-level correlations for translations into English in Table 2 and for translations out of English in Table 3.",
        "Each row in the tables contains correlations of a metric in each of the examined translation directions.",
        "The metrics are sorted by average Pearson correlation coefficient across translation directions.",
        "The best results in each direction are in bold.",
        "The reported empirical confidence intervals of system level correlations were obtained through bootstrap resampling of 1000 samples (confidence level of 95 %).",
        "As in previous years, a lot of metrics outperformed BLEU in system level correlation.",
        "In into-English directions, metric DISCOTK-PARTY-TUNED has the highest correlation in two language directions and it is also the best correlated metric on average according to both Pearson and Spearman's coefficients.",
        "The second best correlated metric on average (according to Pearson) is LAYERED which is also the single best metric in Hindi-to-English direction.",
        "Metrics REDSYS and REDSYSSENT are quite unstable, they win in French-to-English and Czech-to-English directions respectively but they perform very poorly in 294 other directions.",
        "Except METEOR, none of the participants took part in the last year metrics task.",
        "We can therefore compare current and last year results only for METEOR and baseline metrics.",
        "METEOR, the last year winner, performs generally well in some directions but it horribly suffers when evaluating translations from non-Latin script (Russian and especially Hindi).",
        "For the baseline metrics the results are quite similar across the years.",
        "In both years BLEU performs best among baseline met-rics, closely followed by CDER.",
        "NIST is in the middle of the list in both years.",
        "The remaining baseline metrics TER, WER and PER perform much worse.",
        "The results into German are markedly lower and have broader confidence intervals than the results in other directions.",
        "This could be explained by a very high number (18) of participating systems of similar quality.",
        "Both human judgements and automatic metrics are negatively affected by these circumstances.",
        "To preserve the reliability of overall metrics?",
        "performance across languages, we decided to exclude English-to-German direction from the average Pearson and Spearman's correlation coefficients.",
        "In other out-of-English directions, the best correlated metric on average according to Pearson coefficient is NIST, even though it does not win in any single direction.",
        "CDER is the second best according to Pearson and the best metric according to Spearman?s.",
        "Again it does not win in any single direction.",
        "The metrics PER and WER are quite unstable.",
        "Each of them wins in two directions but performs very badly in others.",
        "Compared to the last year results, the order of metrics participating in both years is quite simi-lar: NIST and CDER performed very well both years, followed by BLEU.",
        "The metrics TER and WER are again at the end of the list.",
        "An interesting change is that PER perform much better this year.",
        "3.1 Reasons for Pearson correlation coefficient In the translation task, there are often similar systems with human scores very close to each other.",
        "It can therefore easily happen that even a good metric compares two similar systems differently from humans.",
        "We believe that the penalty incurred by the metric for such a swap should somehow reflect that the systems were hard to separate.",
        "Since the Spearman's ?",
        "converts both human and metric scores to ranks and therefore disregards the absolute differences in the scores, it does exactly what we feel is not fair.",
        "The Pearson correlation coefficient does not suffer from this problem.",
        "We are aware of the fact that Pearson correlation coefficient also reflects whether the relation between manual and automatic scores is linear (as opposed to e.g. quadratic).",
        "We don't think this would be negatively affecting any of the metrics since overall, the systems are of a comparable quality and the metrics are likely to behave linearly in this small range of scores.",
        "Moreover, the general agreement to adopt Pearson instead of Spearman's correlation coefficient was already apparent during the WMT12 workshop.",

        "Despite somewhat sacrificing the year-to-year comparabil-ity, we believe all changes are towards a fairer evaluation and thus better in the long term.",
        "As in previous years, segment-level correlations are much lower than system-level ones, reaching at most Kendall's ?",
        "of 0.45 for the best performing metric in its best language pair.",
        "So there is quite some research work to be done.",
        "We are happy to see that many new metrics emerged this year, which also underlines the importance of the Metrics Shared Task.",
