        "The purpose of machine translation (MT) quality estimation (QE) is to provide a quality prediction for new, unseen machine translated texts, without relying on reference translations (Blatz et al., 2004; Specia et al., 2009; Bojar et al., 2013).",
        "A common use of quality predictions is the decision between post-editing a given machine translated sentence and translating its source from scratch, based on whether its post-editing effort is estimated to be lower than the effort of translating the source sentence.",
        "The WMT 2014 QE shared task defined a group of tasks related to QE.",
        "In this paper, we describe our submissions for subtasks 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3.",
        "Our models are based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006), a non-parametric kernelised probabilistic framework.",
        "We propose to combine multiple datasets to improve our QE models by applying GPs in a multi-task setting.",
        "Our hypothesis is that using sensible multi-task learning settings gives improvements over simply pooling all datasets together.",
        "Task 1.1 focuses on predicting post-editing effort for four language pairs: English-Spanish (en-es), Spanish-English (es-en), English-German (en-de), and German-English (de-en).",
        "Each contains a different number of source sentences and their human translations, as well as 2-3 versions of machine translations: by a statistical (SMT) system, a rule-based system (RBMT) system and, for en-es/de only, a hybrid system.",
        "Source sentences were extracted from tests sets of WMT13 and WMT12, and the translations were produced by top MT systems of each type and a human translator.",
        "Labels range from 1 to 3, with 1 indicating a perfect translation and 3, a low quality translation.",
        "The purpose of task 1.2 is to predict HTER scores (Human Translation Error Rate) (Snover et al., 2006) using a dataset composed of 896 English-Spanish sentences translated by a MT system and post-edited by a professional translator.",
        "Finally, task 1.3 aims at predicting post-editing time, using a subset of 650 sentences from the Task 1.2 dataset.",
        "For each task, participants can submit two types of results: scoring and ranking.",
        "For scoring, evaluation is made in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).",
        "For ranking, DeltaAvg and Spearman's rank correlation were used as evaluation metrics.",

        "The remaining question is how to choose the inducing inputs.",
        "We follow the approach of Snelson and Ghahramani (2006), which note that these inducing inputs do not need to be a subset of the training data.",
        "Their method considers each input as a hyperparameter, which is then optimised jointly with the kernel hyperparameters.",
        "2.3 Features For all tasks we used the QuEst framework (Spe- cia et al., 2013) to extract a set of 80 black-box features as in Shah et al. (2013), for which we had all the necessary resources available.",
        "Examples of the features extracted include: ?",
        "N-gram-based features: ?",
        "Number of tokens in source and target segments; ?",
        "Language model (LM) probability of source and target segments; ?",
        "Percentage of source 1?3-grams observed in different frequency quartiles of a large corpus of the source language; ?",

        "?",
        "POS-based features: ?",
        "Ratio of percentage of nouns/verbs/etc in the source and target segments; ?",
        "Ratio of punctuation symbols in source and target segments; ?",
        "Percentage of direct object personal or possessive pronouns incorrectly translated.",
        "For the full set of features we refer readers to QuEst website.",
        "2 To perform feature selection, we followed the approach used in Shah et al. (2013) and ranked the features according to their learned lengthscales (from the lowest to the highest).",
        "The lengthscale of a feature can be interpreted as the relevance of such feature for the model.",
        "Therefore, the outcome of a GP model using an ARD kernel can be viewed as a list of features ranked by relevance, and this information can be used for feature selection by discarding the lowest ranked (least useful) ones.",
        "3 Preliminary Experiments Our submissions are based on multi-task settings.",
        "For task 1.1, we consider each language pair as a different task, training one model for all pairs.",
        "For tasks 1.2 and 1.3, we used additional datasets and encoded each one as a different task (totalling 3 tasks): WMT13: these are the datasets provided in last year's QE shared task (Bojar et al., 2013).",
        "We combined training and test sets, totalling 2, 754 sentences for HTER prediction and 1, 003 sentences for post-editing time predic-tion, both for English-Spanish.",
        "EAMT11: this dataset is provided by Specia (2011) and is composed of 1, 000 English-Spanish sentences annotated in terms of HTER and post-editing time.",
        "For each task we prepared two submissions: one trained on a standard GP with the full 80 features set and another one trained on a sparse GP with a subset of 40 features.",
        "The features were chosen by training a smaller model on a subset of 400 instances and following the procedure explained in Section 2.3 for feature selection, with a pre-define cutoff point on the number of features (40), based on previous experiments.",
        "The sparse models were trained using 400 inducing inputs.",
        "To select an appropriate multi-task setting for our submissions we performed preliminary experiments using a 90%/10% split on the corresponding training set for each task.",
        "The resulting MAE scores are shown in Tables 1 and 2, for standard and sparse GPs, respectively.",

        "Using standard GPs we obtained improved results over the baseline for English-Spanish and English-German only, with particularly substantial improvements for English-Spanish, which also happens for sparse GPs.",
        "This may be related to the larger size of this dataset when compared to the others.",
        "Our results here are mostly inconclusive though and we plan to investigate this setting more in depth in the future.",
        "Specifically, due to the coarse behaviour of the labels, ordinal regression GP models (like the one proposed in (Chu et al., 2005)) could be useful for this task.",
        "Results for Task 1.2 are shown in Table 5.",
        "The standard GP model performed unusually poorly when compared to the baseline or the sparse GP model.",

        "We found out that the noise ?",
        "2 n was optimised to a very low value, close to zero, which characterises overfitting.",
        "The same behaviour was not observed with the sparse model, even though it had a much higher number of hyperparameters to optimise, and was therefore more prone to overfitting.",
        "We plan to investigate this issue further but a possible cause could be bad starting values for the hyperparameters.",
        "Table 6 shows results for Task 1.3.",
        "In this task, the standard GP model outperformed the base-line, with the sparse GP model following very closely.",
        "These figures represent significant improvements compared to our submission to the same task in last year's shared task (Beck et al., 2013), where we were not able to beat the baseline.",
        "The main differences between last year's and this year's models are the use of additional datasets and a higher number of features (25 vs. 40).",
        "The competitive results for the sparse GP models are very promising because they show we can combine multiple datasets to improve post-editing time prediction while employing a sparse model to cope with speed issues.",

        "These datasets are usually labelled by dozens of annotators and multi-task GPs have proved an interesting framework for learning the annotation noise (Cohn and Specia, 2013).",
