        "Evaluating Machine Translation (MT) quality is a difficult task, in which even human experts may fail to achieve a high degree of agreement when assessing translations.",
        "Conducting manual evaluations is impractical during the development cycle of MT systems or for transation applications addressed to general users, such as online translation portals.",
        "Automatic evaluation measures bring valuable benefits in such situations.",
        "Compared to manual evaluation, automatic measures are cheap, more objective, and reusable across different test sets and domains.",
        "Nonetheless, automatic metrics are far from perfection: when used in isolation, they tend to stress specific aspects of the translation quality and neglect others (particularly during tuning); they are often unable to capture little system improvements (enhancements in very specific aspects of the translation process); and they may make unfair comparisons when they are not able to reflect real differences among the quality of different MT systems (Gim?enez, 2008).",
        "ASIYA, the core of our approach, is an open-source suite for automatic machine translation evaluation and output analysis.",
        "1 It provides a rich set of heterogeneous metrics and tools to evaluate and analyse the quality of automatic translations.",
        "The ASIYA core toolkit was first released in 2009 (Gim?enez and M`arquez, 2010a) and has been continuously improved and extended since then (Gonz`alez et al., 2012; Gonz`alez et al., 2013).",
        "In this paper we first describe the most recent enhancements to ASIYA: (i) linguistic-based metrics for French and German; (ii) an extended set of source-based metrics for English, Spanish, Ger-man, French, Russian, and Czech; and (iii) the integration of mechanisms to exploit the alignments between sources and translations.",
        "These enhancements are all available in ASIYA since version 3.0.",
        "We have used them to prepare the UPC submissions to the WMT14 Metrics Task: UPC-IPA and UPC-STOUT, which serve the purpose of testing their usefulness in a real comparative setting.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the new reference-based metrics developed, including syntactic parsers for languages other than English.",
        "Section 3 gives the details of novel source-based metrics, developed for almost all the language pairs in this challenge.",
        "Section 4 explains our simple metrics combination strategy and analyses the results obtained with both approaches, UPC-IPA and UPC-STOUT, when applied to the WMT13 dataset.",
        "Finally, Section 5 summarises our main contributions.",
        "2 Reference-based Metrics We recently added a new set of metrics to ASIYA, which estimate the similarity between reference (ref ) and candidate (cand) translations.",
        "The met-1 http://asiya.lsi.upc.edu 394 rics rely either on structural linguistic information (Section 2.1), on a semantic mapping (Sec- tion 2.2), or on word n-grams (Section 2.3).",
        "2.1 Parsing-based Metrics Our initial set of parsing-based metrics is a follow-up of the proposal by Gim?enez and M`arquez (2010b): it leverages the structural information provided by linguistic processors to compute several similarity cues between two analyzed sentences.",
        "ASIYA includes plenty of metrics that capture syntactic and semantic aspects of a translation.",
        "New metrics based on linguistic structural information for French and German and upgraded versions of the parsers for English and Spanish are available since version 3.0.",
        "2 In the WMT14 evaluation, we opt for metrics based on shallow parsing (SP), constituency parsing (CP), and dependency parsing (DPm) 3 .",
        "Measures based on named entities (NE) and semantic roles (SR) were used to analyse translations into English as well.",
        "The nomenclature used below follows the same patterns as in the ASIYA's manual (Gonz`alez and Gim?enez, 2014).",
        "The manual describes every family of metrics in detail.",
        "Next, we briefly depict the concrete metrics involved in our submissions to the WMT14 Shared Task.",
        "The set of SP metrics is available for English, German, French, Spanish and Catalan.",
        "They measure the lexical overlapping between parts-of-speech elements in the candidate and reference translations.",
        "For instance, SP-Op(VB) measures the proportion of correctly translated verbs; and the coarser SP-Op(*) averages the overlapping between the words for each part of speech.",
        "We also use NIST (Doddington, 2002) to compute accumulated scores over sequences of n = 1..5 parts of speech (SP-pNIST).",
        "Similarly, CP metrics analyse similarities between constituent parse trees associated to candidate and reference translations.",
        "For instance, CP-STMi5 and CP-STM4 compute, respectively, the proportion of (individual) length-5 and accumulated up to length-4 matching sub-paths of the syntactic tree (Liu and Gildea, 2005).",
        "CP-Oc(*) computes the lexical overlap averaged over all the phrase constituents.",
        "Constituent trees are obtained using the parsers of Charniak and Johnson (2005), 2 Equivalent resources were previously available for En-glish, Catalan, and Spanish.",
        "3 ASIYA includes two dependency parsers; the m identifies the metrics calculated using the MALT parser.",
        "Bonsai v3.2 (Candito et al., 2010b), and Berkeley Parser (Petrov et al., 2006; Petrov and Klein, 2007) for English, French, and German, respectively.",
        "Measures based on dependency parsing (DPm) ?",
        "available for English and French thanks to the MALT parser (Nivre et al., 2007)?",
        "capture the similarities between dependency tree items (i.e., heads and modifiers).",
        "The pre-trained models for French were obtained from the French Treebank (Candito et al., 2010a) and used to train the Bonsai parser, which in turn uses the MALT parser.",
        "For instance, DPm-HWCM w-3 retrieves average accumulated proportion of matching word-chains (Liu and Gildea, 2005) up to length 3; and DPm-HWCMi c-3 computes the proportion of matching category-chains of length 3.",
        "2.2 Explicit-Semantics Metric Additionally, we borrowed a metric originally proposed in the field of Information Retrieval: explicit semantic analysis (ESA) (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007).",
        "ESA is a similarity metric that relies on a large corpus of general knowledge to represent texts.",
        "Our knowledge corpora are composed of ?",
        "100K Wikipedia articles from 2010 for the following target languages: English, French and German.",
        "In this case, ref and cand translations are both mapped onto the Wikipedia collection W .",
        "The similarities between each text and every article a ?",
        "W are computed on the basis of the cosine measure in order to compose a similarities vector that represents the text.",
        "That is: ~ ref = {sim(ref, a) ?a ?W} , (1) ~ cand = {sim(cand, a)?a ?W} .",
        "(2) As the i-th elements in both ~ ref and ~ cand represent the similarity of ref and cand sentences to a common article, the similarity between ref and cand can be estimated by computing sim( ~ ref, ~ cand).",
        "2.3 Language-Independent Resource-Free Metric We consider a simple characterisation based on word n-grams.",
        "Texts are broken down into overlapping word sequences of length n, with 1-word shifting.",
        "The similarity between cand and ref is computed on the basis of the Jaccard coefficient (Jaccard, 1901).",
        "We used this metric for the pairs English?Russian and Russian-English, considering n = 2 (NGRAM-jacTok2ngram).",
        "For the 395 rest of the pairs we opt for the character-n-gram metrics described in Section 3.1, but they showed no positive results in the English?Russian pair during our tuning experiments.",
        "3 Source-based Metrics We enhance our evaluation module by including a set of new metrics that compare the source text against the translations.",
        "The metrics can be divided into two subsets: those that do not require any external resources (Section 3.1) and those that depend on a parallel corpus (Section 3.2).",
        "3.1 Language-Independent Resource-Free Metrics We opted for two characterisations that allow for the comparison of texts across languages without external resources nor language-related knowledge ?as far as the languages use the same writing system.",
        "4 The first characterisation is character n-grams; proposed by McNamee and Mayfield (2004) for cross-language information retrieval between European languages.",
        "Texts are broken down into overlapping character sequences of length n, with 1-character shifting.",
        "We opt for case-folded bi-grams (NGRAM-cosChar2ngrams), as they allowed for the best performance across all the pairs (except for From/To Russian pairs) during tuning.",
        "The second characterisation (NGRAM- jacCognates) is based on the concept of cognateness; originally proposed for bitexts alignment (Simard et al., 1992).",
        "A word is a pseudo-cognate candidate if (i) it has only letters and |w| ?",
        "4, (ii) it contains at least one digit, or (iii) it is a single punctuation mark.",
        "src and cand sentences are then represented as word vectors, containing only those words fulfilling one of the previous conditions.",
        "In the case of (i) the word is cut down to its leading four characters only.",
        "In both cases (character n-grams and cognate-ness) cand translations are compared against src sentences on the basis of the cosine similarity measure.",
        "3.2 Parallel-Corpus Metrics We consider two metrics that make use of parallel corpora: length factor and alignment.",
        "4 Previous research showed that transliteration is a good short-cut when dealing with different writing systems (Barr?on-Cede?no et al., 2014).",

        "For instance, translations from English into Spanish or French tend to be longer than their source.",
        "Similar measures were proposed during the statistical machine translation early days, both considering character- and word-level lengths (Gale and Church, 1993; Brown et al., 1991).",

        ".",
        "This is a stochastic normal distribution that results in higher values as the length of the target text approaches the expected value given the source.",
        "Table 1 includes the values for each language pair, as estimated on the WMT13 parallel corpora.",
        "Note that this metric was not applied to Hindi?English since this language pair was not present in the WMT13 challenge.",
        "The last of our newly-added measures relies on the word alignments calculated between the sentence pairs src?cand and src?ref.",
        "We trained alignment models for each language pair using the Berkeley Aligner 5 , and devised three variants of an ALGN metric, which compute: (i) the proportion of aligned words between src and cand (AL- GNs); (ii) the proportion of aligned words between cand and ref, calculated as the combination of the alignments src?cand and src?ref (ALGNr); and (iii) the ratio of shared alignments between src?",
        "cand and src?ref (ALGNp).",
        "4 Experimental Results The tuning and selection of the different metrics to build UPC-IPA and UPC-STOUT was 5 https://code.google.com/p/berkeleyaligner 396 conducted considering the WMT13 Metrics Task dataset (Mach?a?cek and Bojar, 2013), and the resources distributed for the WMT13 Translation Task (Bojar et al., 2013).",
        "Table 2 gives a complete list of these metrics grouped by families.",
        "First, we calculated the Pearson's correlation with the human judgements for all the metrics in the current version of the ASIYA repos-itory, including standard MT evaluation metrics, such as METEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2011), GTM (Melamed et al., 2003), -TERp-A (Snover et al., 2009) (a variant of TER tuned towards ade-quacy), WER (Nie?en et al., 2000) and PER (Till- mann et al., 1997).",
        "We selected the best performing metrics (i.e., those resulting in high Pearson coefficients) in each family across all the From/To English translation language pairs, including the newly developed measures ?even if they performed poorly compared to others (see This is how the UPC-STOUT metrics sets for both from English and To English translation pairs were composed 6 (see Table 3).",

        "They were composed following different criteria, depending on the translation direction.",
        "Parsing-based measures were already available in the previous version of ASIYA when translating into English ?",
        "they are known to be robust across domains and are usually good indicators of translation quality (Gim?enez and M`arquez, 2007).",
        "So, in order to assess the gain achieved with these measures with respect the new ones, UPC-IPA neglects the measures based on structural information obtained from parsers.",
        "In contrast, this distinction was not suitable for the From English pairs since the number of resources and measures varies for each language.",
        "Hence, in this latter case, UPC-IPA used only the subset of measures from UPC-STOUT that required no or little resources.",
        "In summary, when English is the target lan-guage, UPC-IPA uses the baseline evaluation metrics along with the length factor, alignments-based metrics, character n-grams, and ESA.",
        "In addition to the above metrics, UPC-STOUT uses the linguistic-based metrics over parsing trees, named entities, and semantic roles.",
        "When English is the source language, UPC-IPA relies on the basic collection of metrics and character n-grams only.",
        "UPC-STOUT includes the alignment-based metrics, length factor, ESA, and the syntactic parsers applied to both German and French.",
        "In all cases (metric sets and language pairs), the translation quality score is computed as the uniformly-averaged linear combination (ULC) of all the individual metrics for each sentence in the testset.",
        "Its calculation implies the normalization of heterogeneous scores (some of them are negative or unbounded), into the range [0, 1].",
        "As a consequence, the scores of UPC-IPA and UPC-STOUT constitute a natural way of ranking different translations, rather than an overall quality estimation measure.",
        "We opt for this linear combination for simplicity.",
        "The discussion below suggests that a more sophisticated method for weight tuning (e.g., relying on machine learning methods) would be required for each language pair, domain and/or task since different metric families perform notably different for each subtask.",
        "We complete our experimentation by evaluating more configurations: BAS, a baseline 7 These are the full sets of measures for each configuration.",

        "As a result, it is clear that specific configurations are necessary for evaluating different languages and domains.",
        "We plan to approach these issues as part of our future work.",
        "When looking at the system-level figures, one can observe that the SEM set allows for a considerable improvement over the baseline system.",
        "The further inclusion of the SYN set ?when available?, tends to increase the quality of the estimations, mainly when English is the source language.",
        "These properties impact on some of the UPC-STOUT configurations.",

        "Finally, it merits some attention the good results achieved by the baseline for translations into English.",

        "Both UPC-IPA and UPC-STOUT configurations resulted in different performances depending on the language pair.",
        "UPC-STOUT scored above the average for all the language pairs except for en?cs at both system and segment level, and en?ru at system level.",
        "Although the evaluation results are not directly comparable to the WMT13 ones, one can note that the results were notably better for pairs that involved Czech and Russian, and worse for those that involved French and German at system level.",
        "Analysing the impact of the evaluation methods and building comparable results in order to address a study on configurations for different languages is part of our future work.",

        "Among the novelties, (i) new shallow metrics, borrowed from Information Retrieval, were included to compare the candidate translation against both the reference translation (monolingual compari-son) and the source sentence (cross-language com-parison), including explicit semantic analysis and the lexical-based characterisations character n-grams and pseudo-cognates; (ii) new parsers for other languages than English were applied to compare automatic and reference translation at the syntactic level; (iii) an experimental metric based on alignments; and (iv) a metric based on the correlation of the translations?",
