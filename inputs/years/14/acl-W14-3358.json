        "The task of lexical selection plays an important role in statistical machine translation (SMT).",
        "It strongly depends on context and is particularly difficult when the domain of a test document is un-known, for example when translating web documents from diverse sources.",
        "Selecting translations of words or phrases that preserve the sense of the source words is closely related to the field of word sense disambiguation (WSD), which has been studied extensively in the past.",
        "Most approaches to WSD model context at the sentence level and do not take the wider context of a word into account.",
        "Some of the ideas from the field of WSD have been adapted for machine translation (Carpuat and Wu, 2007b; Carpuat and Wu, 2007a; Chan et al., 2007).",
        "For example, Carpuat and Wu (2007a) extend word sense disambiguation to phrase sense disambiguation and show improved performance due to the better fit with multiple possible segmentations in a phrase-based system.",
        "Carpuat (2009) test the ?one sense per discourse?",
        "hypothesis (Gale et al., 1992) for MT and find that enforcing it as a constraint at the document level could potentially improve translation quality.",
        "Our goal is to make correct lexical choices in a given context without explicitly enforcing translation consistency.",
        "More recent work in SMT uses latent representations of the document context to dynamically adapt the translation model with either monolingual topic models (Eidelman et al., 2012; Hewavitharana et al., 2013) or bilingual topic models (Hasler et al., 2014), thereby allowing the translation system to disambiguate source phrases using document context.",
        "Eidelman et al. (2012) also apply a topic model to each test sentence and find that sentence context is sufficient for picking good translations, but they do not attempt to combine sentence and document level information.",
        "Sentence-level topic adaptation for SMT has also been employed by Hasler et al. (2012).",
        "Other approaches to topic adaptation for SMT include Zhao and Xing (2007) and Tam et al. (2008), both of which use adapted lexical weights.",
        "In this paper, we present a topic model that learns latent distributional representations of the context of a phrase pair which can be applied to both local and global contexts at test time.",
        "We introduce similarity features that compare latent representations of phrase pair types to test contexts to disambiguate senses for improved lexical selection.",
        "We also propose different strategies for combining local and global topical context and show that using clues from both levels of contexts is beneficial for translation model adaptation.",
        "We evaluate our model on a dynamic adaptation task where the domain of a test document is unknown and hence the problem of lexical selection is harder.",
        "445 2 Related work Most work in the WSD literature has modelled disambiguation using a limited window of context around the word to disambiguate.",
        "Cai et al. (2007), Boyd-graber and Blei (2007) and Li et al. (2010) further tried to integrate the notion of latent topics to address the sparsity problem of the lexicalised features typically used in WSD classifiers.",
        "The most closely related work in the area of sense disambiguation is by Dinu and Lapata (2010) who propose a disambiguation method for solving lexical similarity and substitution tasks.",
        "They measure word similarity in context by learning distributions over senses for each target word in the form of lower-dimensional distributional representations.",
        "Before computing word similar-ities, they contextualise the global sense distribution of a word using the sense distribution of words in the test context, thereby shifting the sense distribution towards the test context.",
        "We adopt a similar distributional representation, but argue that our representation does not need this disambiguation step because at the level of phrase pairs the ambiguity is already much reduced.",
        "Our model performs adaptation using similarity features which is similar to the approach of Costa-juss`a and Banchs (2010) who learn a vector space model that captures the source context of every training sentence.",
        "In Banchs and Costa-juss`a (2011), the vector space model is replaced with representations inferred by Latent Semantic Indexing.",
        "However, because their latent representations are learned over training sentences, they have to compare the current test sentence to the latent vector of every training instance associated with a translation unit.",
        "The highest similarity value is then used as a feature value.",
        "Instead, our model learns latent distributional representations of phrase pairs that can be directly compared to test contexts and are likely to be more robust.",
        "Because context words of a phrase pair are tied together in the distributional representations, we can use sparse priors to cluster context words associated with the same phrase pair into few topics.",
        "Recently, Chen et al. (2013) have proposed a vector space model for domain adaptation where phrase pairs are assigned vectors that are defined in terms of the training corpora.",
        "A similar vector is built for an in-domain development set and the similarity to the development set is used as a feature during translation.",
        "While their vector representations are similar to our latent topic represen-tations, their model has no notion of structure beyond corpus boundaries and is adapted towards a single target domain (cross-domain).",
        "Instead, our model learns the latent topical structure automatically and the translation model is adapted dynamically to each test instance.",
        "We are not aware of prior work in the field of MT that investigates combinations of local and global context.",
        "In their recent work on neural language models, Huang et al. (2012) combine the scores of two neural networks modelling the word embeddings of previous words in a sequence as well as those of words from the surrounding document by averaging over all word embeddings occurring in the same document.",
        "The score of the next word in a sequence is computed as the sum of the scores of both networks, but they do not consider alternative ways of combining contextual information.",
        "3 Phrase pair topic model (PPT) Our proposed model aims to capture the relationship between phrase pairs and source words that frequently occur in the local context of a phrase pair, that is, context words occurring in the same sentence.",
        "It therefore follows the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954) which states that words that occur in the same contexts tend to have similar meanings.",
        "For a phrase pair, the idea is that words that occur frequently in its context are indicative of the sense that is captured by the target phrase translating the source phrase.",
        "We assume that all phrase pairs share a global set of topics and during topic inference the distribution over topics for each phrase pair is induced from the latent topic of its context words in the training data.",
        "In order to learn topic distributions for each phrase pair, we represent phrase pairs as documents containing all context words from the source sentence context in the training data.",
        "These distributional profiles of phrase pairs are the input to the topic modelling algorithm which learns topic clusters over context words.",

        "This is useful for reducing noise and constraining the semantic space that the model considers for each phrase pair during training.",
        "At test time, however, we are not limited to applying the model only to the immediate surroundings of a source phrase to disambiguate its meaning.",

        "While this work focuses on exploring vector space similarity for adaptation, mostly for computational ease, it may be possible to derive probabilistic translation features from the PPT model.",
        "This could be a useful addition to the model and we leave this as an avenue for future work.",
        "Types of similarity features We experiment with local and global phrase similarity features, phrSim-local and phrSim-global, to perform dynamic topic adaptation.",
        "These two similarity features can be combined by adding them both to the log-linear SMT model, in which case each receive separate feature weights.",
        "Whenever we use the + symbol in our results tables, the additional features were combined with existing features log-linearly.",

        "We also experiment with a combination of the phrase pair similarity features derived from the PPT model with a document similarity feature from the pLDA model described in Hasler et al. (2014).",
        "The motivation is that their model learns topic mixtures for documents and uses phrases instead of words to infer the topical context.",
        "There-fore, it might provide additional information to our similarity features.",
        "5 Data and experimental setup Our experiments were carried out on a mixed French-English data set containing the TED corpus (Cettolo et al., 2012), parts of the News Commentary corpus (NC) and parts of the Commoncrawl corpus (CC) from the WMT13 shared task (Bojar et al., 2013) as described in Table 1.",
        "To ensure that the baseline model does not have an implicit preference for any particular domain, we selected subsets of the NC and CC corpora such that the training data contains 2.7M English words per domain.",
        "We were guided by two constraints in chosing our data set in order to simulate an environment where very diverse documents have to be translated, which is a typical scenario for web translation engines: 1) the data has document boundaries and the content of each document is assumed to be topically related, 2) there is some degree of topical variation within each data set.",

        "The length of longer sentences was clipped to 30. topic adaptation approach because the test documents are from different domains and also differ within each domain, which makes lexical selection a much harder problem.",
        "The topic adaptation approach does not make use of the domain labels in training or test, because it infers topic mixtures in an unsupervised way.",
        "However, we compare the performance of our dynamic approach to domain adaptation methods by providing them the domain labels for each document in training and test.",
        "In order to abstract away from adaptation effects that concern tuning of length penalties and language models, we use a mixed tuning set containing data from all three domains and train one language model on the concatenation of the target sides of the training data.",

        "While this can explain why for CC documents using local or global context results in similar perfor-mance, it does not explain the better performance of the local feature for NC documents.",
        "The last row of Table 5 shows that sentences in the NC documents are on average the longest and longer sentences would be expected to yield more reliable topic estimates than shorter sentences.",
        "Thus, we assume that local context yields better performance for NC because on average the sentences are long enough to yield reliable topic estimates.",
        "When local context provides reliable information, it may be more informative than global context because it can be more specific.",
        "For TED, we see the largest topical drift per document, which could lead us to believe that the document topic mixtures do not reflect the topical content of the sentences too well.",
        "But considering that the sentences are on average shorter than for the other two domains, it is more likely that the local context in TED documents can be unreliable when the sentences are too short.",
        "TED documents contain transcribed speech and are probably less dense in terms of information content than News commentary documents.",

        "A possible reason is that when one feature is consistently better for one of the domains (local context for NC), the log-linear combination of both features (tuned on data from all domains) would result in a weaker overall model for that domain.",
        "However, if both features encode similar information, as we assume to be the case for CC documents, the presence of both features would reinforce the preference of each and result in equal or better performance.",
        "For the additive combination, we expect a similar effect because adding together two topics vectors that have peaks at different topics would make the resulting topic vector less peaked than either of the original vectors.",
        "The additive topic vector combination is slightly better than the log-linear feature combina-tion, though the difference is small.",
        "Nevertheless, it shows that combining topic vectors before computing similarity features is a viable alternative to log-linear combination, with the potential to design more expressive combination functions.",

        "7 In Table 7, the additive combination preserves the choice of the global model and yields the correct translations, while in Table 8 only the second example is translated correctly by the combined model.",
        "A possible explanation is that the topical signal from the global context is stronger and results in more discriminative similarity values.",
        "In that case, the preference of the global context would be likely to have a larger influence on the similarity values in the combined model.",
