        "Scalable discriminative algorithm design for machine translation (MT) has lately been a booming enterprise.",
        "There are now algorithms for every taste: probabilistic and distribution-free, online and batch, regularized and unregularized.",
        "Technical differences aside, the papers that apply these algorithms to phrase-based translation often share a curious empirical characteristic: the algorithms support extra features, but the features do not significantly improve translation.",
        "For example, Hopkins and May (2011) showed that PRO with some simple ad hoc features only exceeds the baseline on one of three language pairs.",
        "Gimpel and Smith (2012b) observed a similar result for both PRO and their ramp-loss algorithm.",
        "Cherry and Foster (2012) found that, at least in the batch case, many algorithms produce similar results, and features only significantly increased quality for one of three language pairs.",
        "Only recently did Cherry (2013) and Green et al. (2013b) identify certain features that consistently reduce error.",
        "These empirical results suggest that feature design and model fitting, the subjects of this paper, warrant a closer look.",
        "We introduce an effective extended feature set for phrase-based MT and identify a loss function that is less prone to overfitting.",
        "Extended features share three attractive characteristics with the standard Moses dense features (Koehn et al., 2007): ease of implementation, language in-dependence, and independence from ancillary corpora like treebanks.",
        "In our experiments, they do not overfit and can be extracted efficiently during decoding.",
        "Because all feature weights are tuned on the development set, the new feature templates are amenable to feature augmentation (Daum?",
        "III, 2007), a simple domain adaptation technique that we show works surprisingly well for MT.",
        "Extended features are designed according to a principle rather than a rule: they should fire less than standard dense features, which are general, but more than so-called sparse features, which are very specific?they are usually lexicalized -- and thus prone to overfitting.",
        "This principle is motivated by analysis, which shows how expressive models can be a mixed blessing in the translation setting.",
        "It is obvious that features allow the model to fit the tuning data more tightly.",
        "For example, sparse lexicalized features could reduce tuning error by learning that the references prefer U.S. over United States, a minor lexical distinction.",
        "Reference choice should matter more than in the dense case, an issue that we quantify.",
        "We also show that frequency cut-offs, which are a crude but common form of feature selection, are unnecessary and even detrimental when features follow this principle.",
        "We report large-scale translation quality experiments relative to both dense and feature-rich baselines.",
        "Our best feature set, which includes domain adaptation features, yields an average+1.05 BLEU improvement for Arabic-English and +0.67 for 466 Chinese-English.",
        "In addition to the extended feature set, we show that an online variant of expected error (Och, 2003) is significantly faster to compute, less prone to overfitting, and nearly as effective as a pairwise loss.",

        "Recall that recombination collapses derivations with equivalent recombination maps during search and thus affects learning.",
        "This issue significantly influences feature design.",
        "To learn w, we follow the online procedure of Green et al. (2013b), who calculate gradient steps with AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011) and perform feature selection via L 1 regularization in the FOBOS (Duchi and Singer, 2009) framework.",
        "This procedure accommodates any loss function for which a subgradient can be computed.",
        "Green et al. (2013b) used a PRO objective (Hopkins and May, 2011) with a logistic (surrogate) loss function.",
        "However, later results showed overfitting (Green et al., 2013a), and we found that their online variant of PRO tends to produce short translations like its batch counterpart (Nakov et al., 2013).",
