        "Currently, the dominant approach to machine translation is statistical, starting from the mathematical formulations and algorithms for parameter estimation (Brown et al., 1988), further extended in (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "These early mod-els, widely known as the IBM models, were word-based.",
        "Recent extensions note that a better approach is to group collections of words, or phrases, for translation together, resulting in a significant focus these days on phrase-based statistical machine translation systems.",
        "To deal with the alignment problem of one-to-many word alignments in the IBM model formulation, whereas phrase-based models may have many-to-many translation relationships, IBM models are trained in both directions, source to target and target to source, and their word alignments are combined (Och and Ney, 2004).",
        "While phrase-based systems are a significant improvement over word-based approaches, a particular issue that emerges is long-range reorderings at the phrase level (Galley and Manning, 2008).",
        "Analogous to speech recognition systems, translation systems relied on language models to produce more fluent translation.",
        "While early work penalized phrase movements without considering reorderings arising from vastly differing grammatical structures across language pairs like Arabic-English, many researchers considered lexical reordering models that attempted to learn orientation based on content (Tillmann, 2004; Kumar and Byrne, 2005; Koehn et al., 2005).",
        "These approaches may suffer from the data sparseness problem since many phrase pairs occur only once (Nguyen et al., 2009).",
        "As an alternative way of exploiting function approximation capabilities offered by machine learning methods, there is recent interest in formulating a learning problem that aims to predict reordering from linguistic features that capture their context.",
        "An example of this is the maximum entropy method used by (Xiang et al., 2011; Nguyen et al., 2009; Zens and Ney, 2006; Xiong et al., 2006).",
        "In this work we apply a naive Bayes classifier, combined with feature selection to address the reordering problem.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this simple model of classification has not been used in this context previously.",
        "We present empirical results comparing our work and previously proposed lexicalized reordering model.",
        "We show that our model is scalable to large corpora.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 discusses previous work in the field and how that is related to our paper.",
        "Section 3 gives an overview of the baseline translation system.",
        "Section 4 introduces the Bayesian reordering model and gives details of different inference methods, while, Section 5 describes feature selection method.",
        "Section 6 presents the experiments and reports the results evaluated as classification and translation problems.",

        "2 Related Work The phrase reordering model is a crucial component of any translation system, particularly between language pairs with different grammatical structures (e.g. Arabic-English).",
        "Adding a lexicalized reordering model consistently improved the translation quality for several language pairs (Koehn et al., 2005).",
        "The model tries to predict the orientation of a phrase pair with respect to the previous adjacent target words.",
        "Ideally, the reordering model would predict the right position in the target sentence given a source phrase, which is difficult to achieve.",
        "Therefore, positions are grouped into limited orientations or classes.The orientation probability for a phrase pair is simply based on the relative occurrences in the training corpus.",
        "The lexicalized reordering model has been extended to tackle long-distance reorderings (Gal- ley and Manning, 2008).",
        "This takes into account the hierarchical structure of the sentence when considering such an orientation.",
        "Certain examples are often used to motivate syntax-based systems were handled by this hierarchical model, and this approach is shown to improve translation performance for several translation tasks with small computational cost.",
        "Despite the fact that the lexicalized reordering model is always biased towards the most frequent orientation for such a phrase pair, it may suffer from a data sparseness problem since many phrase pairs occur only once.",
        "Moreover, the context of a phrase might affect its orientation, which is not considered as well.",
        "Adopting the idea of predicting orientation based on content, it has been proposed to represent each phrase pair by linguistic features as reordering evidence, and then train a classifier for prediction.",
        "The maximum entropy classifier is a popular choice among many researchers (Zens and Ney, 2006; Xiong et al., 2006; Nguyen et al., 2009; Xiang et al., 2011).",
        "Max-margin structure classifiers were also proposed (Ni et al., 2011).",
        "Recently, Cherry (2013) proposed using sparse features optimize BLEU with the decoder instead of training a classifier independently.",
        "We distinguish our work from the previous ones in the following.",
        "We propose a fast reordering model using a naive Bayes classifier with feature selection.",
        "In this study, we undertake a comparison between our work and lexicalized reordering model.",
        "3 Baseline System In statistical machine translation, the most likely translation e best of an input sentence f can be found by maximizing the probability p(e|f), as follows: e best = arg max e p(e|f).",
        "(1) A log-linear combination of different models (features) is used for direct modeling of the posterior probability p(e|f) (Papineni et al., 1998; Och and Ney, 2002): e best = arg max e n ?",

        "The translation model and the language model are the main features in any system although additional features h(.)",
        "can be integrated easily (such as word penalty).",
        "State-of-the-art systems usually have around ten features (i.e. n = 10).",
        "In phrase-based systems, the translation model can capture the local meaning for each source phrase.",
        "However, to capture the whole meaning of a sentence, its translated phrases need to be in the correct order.",
        "The language model, which ensures fluent translation, plays an important role in reordering; however, it prefers sentences that are grammatically correct without considering their actual meaning.",
        "Besides that, it has a bias towards short translations (Koehn, 2010).",
        "Therefore, developing a reordering model will improve the accuracy particularly when translating between two grammatically different languages.",
        "3.1 Lexicalized Reordering Model Phrase reordering modeling involves formulating phrase movements as a classification problem 478 where each phrase position considered as a class (Tillmann, 2004).",
        "Some researchers classified phrase movements into three categories (mono- tone, swap, and discontinuous) but the classes can be extended to any arbitrary number (Koehn and Monz, 2005).",
        "In general, the distribution of phrase orientation is: p(o k | ?",

        "(3) This lexicalized reordering model is estimated by relative frequency where each phrase pair ( ?",
        "f n , e?",

        "n , o) .",
        "(4) The orientation class of a current phrase pair is defined with respect to the previous target word or phrase (i.e. word-based classes or phrase-based classes).",
        "In the case of three categories (mono- tone, swap, and discontinuous): monotone is the previous source phrase (or word) that is previously adjacent to the current source phrase, swap is the previous source phrase (or word) that is next-adjacent to the current source phrase, and discontinuous is not monotone or swap.",

        "Hence they are not related to the classification task and can be excluded from the model.",
        "The model with almost half of the feature space is as good as the one with full feature space.",
        "Previously proposed discriminative models might achieve higher score than the reported results.",
        "However, our model is scalable to large-scale systems since parameter estimation require only one pass over the data with limited memory (i.e. no iterative learning).",
        "This is a critical advantage over discriminative models.",
        "Our current work focuses on three issues.",
        "The first is improving the translation speed of the proposed model.",
        "The lexicalized model is slightly faster.",
        "The second is using more informative features.",
        "We plan to explore part-of-speech informa-tion, which is more accurate in capturing content.",
        "Finally, we will explore different feature selection methods.",
        "In our experiments, feature reduction is based on univariate ranking which is riskier than multivariate ranking.",
        "This is because useless feature can be useful with others.",
