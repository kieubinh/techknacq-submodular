        "Standard phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based statistical machine translation systems, in contrast, allow all phrase pairs that are consistent with the word alignment (Koehn et al., 2003; Chi-ang, 2005).",
        "A restriction of the phrase inventory to syntactically well-formed phrase pairs entails that possibly valuable information from the training data remains disregarded.",
        "While we would expect phrase pairs that are not linguistically motivated to be less reliable, discarding them altogether might be an overly harsh decision.",
        "The quality of an inventory of syntactic phrases depends heavily on the tree annotation scheme and the quality of the syntactic parses of the training data.",
        "Phrase pairs that do not span constituents in the tree annotation obtained from syntactic parses can provide reasonable alternative segmentations or alternative translation options which prove to be valuable to the decoder.",
        "In this work, we augment the phrase inventories of string-to-tree and tree-to-string translation systems with phrase pairs that are not induced in the syntax-based extraction.",
        "We extract continuous phrases that are consistent with the word align-ment, without enforcing any constraints with respect to syntactic tree annotation.",

        "A feature in the log-linear model combination serves to distinguish non-syntactic phrases from syntactic ones.",
        "During decoding, the decoder can draw on both syntactic and non-syntactic phrase table entries and produce derivations which resort to both types of phrases.",
        "Such derivations yield hypotheses that make use of the alternative segmentations and translation options provided through non-syntactic phrases.",
        "The search space is more diverse, and in some cases all hypotheses from purely syntax-based derivations score worse than a translation that applies one or more non-syntactic phrases.",
        "We empirically demonstrate that this technique can lead to substantial gains in translation quality.",
        "Our syntactic translation models conform to the GHKM syntax approach as proposed by Galley, Hopkins, Knight, and Marcu (Galley et al., 2004) with composed rules as in (Galley et al., 2006) and (DeNeefe et al., 2007).",

        "The empirical part is concluded with a brief discussion (5.4).",
        "In the final part of the paper (Section 6), we give a survey of previous work that has dealt with problems related to overly restrictive syntactic grammars for statistical machine translation, inadequate syntactic parses, and insufficient coverage of syntactic phrase inventories.",
        "A broad spectrum of diverse methods has been proposed in the literature, many of which are quite dissimilar from ours but nevertheless related.",
