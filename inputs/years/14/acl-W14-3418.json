        "2 Standard thesaurus-based search engines would retrieve results where SAH denotes the gene/protein of interest, but also occurrences in which it denotes other proteins (e. g., ATX1 antioxidant protein 1 homolog 3 ) or entities from semantic classes other than genes/proteins (e. g., the symptom sub-arachnoid hemorrhage).",
        "For an abbreviation such as SAH, the use as denoting a symptom or another semantic class different from genes/proteins is more frequent by a factor of 70 compared to protein-denoting mentions according to our corpus analysis, such that the retrieval precision for acyl-CoA synthetase by the occurrence of the synonym SAH is only about 0.01, which is totally unacceptable for practical applications.",
        "In this paper, we discuss the specific challenge of recognizing such highly ambiguous abbreviations.",
        "We consider eight entities and show that common corpora for gene/protein recognition are of limited value for their investigation.",
        "The abbreviations we consider are SAH, MOX, PLS, CLU, CLI, HF, AHR and COPD (cf. Table 1).",

        "(ii) We show that the recognition of such ambiguous mentions is important as their string representation is frequent in collections such as MEDLINE.",

        "Machine learning approaches rely on appropriate features describing the local context of the term to be classified and induce a model to perform the classification from training data.",
        "Conditional random fields have shown to yield very good results on the task (Klinger et al., 2007; Leaman and Gonzalez, 2008; Kuo et al., 2007; Settles, 2005).",
        "Dictionary-based approaches rely on an explicit dictionary of gene/protein names that are matched in text.",
        "Such systems are common in practice due to the low overhead required to adapt and maintain the system, essentially only requiring to extend the dictionary.",
        "Examples of commercial systems are ProMiner (Fluck et al., 2007) or I2E (Bandy et al., 2009); a popular free system is made available by Hakenberg et al. (2011).",
        "Such dictionary-based systems typically incorporate rules for filtering false positives.",
        "For instance, in ProMiner (Hanisch et al., 2003), ambiguous synonyms are only accepted based on external dictionaries and matches in the context.",
        "Abbreviations are only accepted if a long form matches all parts of the abbreviation in the context (following Schwartz and Hearst (2003)).",

        "However, feature selection is not equally effective in all individual classes (cf. Table 5).",
        "The benefits due to feature propagation indicate that several instances of the same abbreviation in one abstract should not be considered independently of one another, although we could not verify the intuition that the first mention of an abbreviation introduces particularly valuable information for classification.",

        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to tackle gene/protein recognition from ambiguous abbreviations in a systematic manner without being specific for the particular instances of ambiguous gene/protein homonyms considered.",
        "The proposed method has been proven to allow for an improvement in recognition performance when added to an existing NER workflow.",
        "Despite being restricted to eight entities so far, our approach has been evaluated in a strict cross-entity manner, which suggests sufficient generalization power to be extended to other genes as well.",
        "In future work, we plan to extend the data set to prove the generalizability on a larger scale and on an independent test set.",
        "Furthermore, an inclusion of the features presented in this paper into the CRF will be evaluated.",
        "Moreover, assessing the impact of the global features that turned out beneficial in this paper on other gene/protein inventories seems an interesting path to explore.",
        "Finally, we will investigate the prospects of our approach in an actual black-box evaluation setting for information retrieval.",
