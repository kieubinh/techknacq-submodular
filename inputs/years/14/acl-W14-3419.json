        "The exponential growth of medical text data makes it difficult to extract useful information in a structured format.",
        "Some important features of text data are sparsity and high dimensionality.",
        "This means that while there may be a large number of terms in most of the documents in a corpus, any one document may contain a small percentage of those terms (Aggarwal and Zhai, 2012).",
        "This characteristic of medical text data makes feature transformation an important step in text analysis.",
        "Feature transformation is a pre-processing step in many machine-learning methods that is used to characterize text data in terms of a different number of attributes in lower dimensions.",
        "This technique has a direct impact on the quality of text mining methods.",
        "Topic models such as LDA has been used as one of popular feature transformation techniques (Ramage et al., 2010).",
        "However, fuzzy clustering methods, particularly in combination with term weighting methods, have not been explored much in medical text mining.",
        "In this research, we propose a new method called FFTM to extract features from free-text data.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized in the following sections.",
        "In the section 2, we review related work.",
        "Section 3 contains details about our method.",
        "Section 4 describes our experiments, performance evaluation, and discussions of our results.",
        "Finally we present a summary, limitations, and future work in the last section.",
        "2 Related Work Text analysis is an important topic in medical informatics that is challenging due to high sparse dimensionality data.",
        "Big dimension and diversity of text datasets have been motivated medical researchers to use more feature transformation methods.",
        "Feature transformation methods encapsulate a text corpus in smaller dimensions by merging the initial features.",
        "Topic model is one of popular feature transformation methods.",
        "Among topic models, LDA (Blei et al., 2003) has been considered more due to its better performance (Ghassemi et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2010).",
        "One of methods that has not been fully considered in medical text mining is Fuzzy clustering.",
        "Although most of Fuzzy Clusterings work in medical literature is based on image analysis (Saha and Maulik, 2014; Cui et al., 2013; Beevi and Sathik, 2012), a few work have been done in medical text mining (Ben-Arieh and Gullipalli, 2012; Fenza et al., 2012) by using fuzzy clustering.",
        "The main difference between our method and other document fuzzy clustering such as (Singh et al., 2011) is that our method use fuzzy clustering and word weighting as a pre-processing step for 128 feature transformation before implementing any classification and clustering algorithms; however, other methods use fuzzy clustering as a final step to cluster the documents.",
        "Our main contribution is to improve the quality of input data to improve the output of fuzzy clustering.",
        "Among fuzzy clustering methods, Fuzzy C-means (Bezdek, 1981) is the most popular one (Bataineh et al., 2011).",
        "In this research, we propose a novel method that combines local term weighting and global term weighting with fuzzy clustering.",
        "3 Method In this section, we detail our Fuzzy Feature Transformation Method (FFTM) and describe the steps.",
        "We begin with a brief review of LDA.",
        "LDA is a topic model that can extract hidden topics from a collection of documents.",
        "It assumes that each document is a mixture of topics.",
        "The output of LDA are the topic distributions over documents and the word distributions over topics.",
        "In this research, we use the topics distributions over documents.",
        "LDA uses term frequency for local term weighting.",
        "Now we introduce FFTM concepts and notations.",
        "This model has three main steps including Local Term Weighting (LTW), Global Term Weighting (GTM), and Fuzzy Clustering (Algo- rithm 1).",
        "In this algorithm, each step is the out put of each step will be the input of the next step.",
        "Step 1: The first step is to calculate LTW.",

        "We use them as inputs for the second step.",
        "Step 2: The next step is to calculate GTW.",
        "We explore four GTW methods in this paper including Entropy, Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), Probabilistic Inverse Document Frequency (Pro- bIDF), and Normal(Table 1).",
