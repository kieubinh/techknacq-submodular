        "After a stroke or head injury, individuals may experience aphasia, an impairment in the ability to comprehend or produce language.",
        "The type of aphasia depends on the location of the lesion.",
        "However, even two patients with the same type of aphasia may experience different symptoms.",
        "A careful analysis of narrative speech can reveal specific patterns of impairment, and help a clinician determine whether an individual has aphasia, what type of aphasia it is, and how the symptoms are changing over time.",
        "In this paper, we present an automatic method for the analysis of one type of aphasia, agrammatic aphasia.",
        "characterized by the omission of function words, the omission or substitution of morphological markers for person and number, the absence of verb inflection, and a relative increase in the number of nouns and decrease in the number of verbs (Bastiaanse and Thompson, 2012).",
        "There is often a reduction in the variety of different syntactic structures used, as well as a reduction in the complexity of those structures (Progovac, 2006).",
        "There may also be a strong tendency to use the canonical word order of a language, for example subject-verb-object in English (Progovac, 2006).",
        "Most studies of narrative speech in agrammatic aphasia are based on manually annotated speech transcripts.",
        "This type of analysis can provide detailed and accurate information about the speech patterns that are observed.",
        "However, it is also very time consuming and requires trained transcribers and annotators.",
        "Studies are necessarily limited to a manageable size, and the level of agreement between annotators can vary.",
        "We propose an automatic approach that uses information from statistical parsers to examine properties of narrative speech.",
        "We extract context-free grammar (CFG) production rules as well as phrase-level features from syntactic parses of the speech transcripts.",
        "We show that this approach can detect many features which have been previously reported in the aphasia literature, and that classification of agrammatic patients and controls can be achieved with high accuracy.",
        "We also examine the effects of including speech dysfluencies in the transcripts.",
        "Dysfluencies and non-narrative words are usually removed from the transcripts as a pre-processing step, but we show that by retaining some of these items, we can actually achieve a higher classification accuracy than by using the completely clean transcripts.",
        "Finally, we investigate whether there is any benefit to using the parse features instead of more traditional measures of syntactic complexity, such as Yngve depth or mean sentence length.",
        "We find that the parse features convey more information 134 about the specific syntactic structures being produced (or avoided) by the agrammatic speakers, and lead to better classification accuracies.",
        "2 Related Work 2.1 Syntactic analysis of agrammatic narrative speech Much of the previous work analyzing narrative speech in agrammatic aphasia has been performed manually.",
        "One widely used protocol is called Quantitative Production Analysis (QPA), developed by Saffran et al. (1989).",
        "QPA can be used to measure morphological content, such as whether determiners and verb inflections are produced in obligatory contexts, as well as structural complex-ity, such as the number of embedded clauses per sentence.",
        "Subsequent studies have found a number of differences between normal and agrammatic speech using QPA (Rochon et al., 2000).",
        "Another popular protocol called the Northwestern Narrative Language Analysis (NNLA) was introduced by Thompson et al. (1995).",
        "This protocol analyzes each utterance at five different levels, and focuses in particular on the production of verbs and verb argument structure.",
        "Perhaps more analogous to our work here, Goodglass et al. (1994) conducted a detailed examination of the syntactic constituents used by aphasic patients and controls.",
        "In that study, utterances were grouped according to how many syntactic constituents they contained.",
        "They found that agrammatic participants were more likely to produce single-constituent utterances, especially noun phrases, and less likely to produce subordinate clauses.",
        "They also found that agrammatic speakers sometimes produced two-constituent utterances consisting of only a subject and object, with no verb.",
        "This pattern was never observed in control speech.",
        "A much smaller body of work explores the use of computational techniques to analyze agramma-tism.",
        "Holmes and Singh (1996) analyzed conversational speech from aphasic speakers and controls.",
        "Their features mostly included measures of vocabulary richness and frequency counts of various parts-of-speech (e.g. nouns, verbs); however they also measured ?clause-like semantic unit rate?.",
        "This feature was intended to measure the speaker's ability to cluster words together, although it is not clear what the criteria for segmenting clause-like units were or whether it was done manually or automatically.",
        "Nonetheless, it was found to be one of the most important variables for distinguishing between patients and controls.",
        "MacWhinney et al. (2011) presented several examples of how researchers can use the AphasiaBank 1 database and associated software tools to conduct automatic analyses (although the transcripts are first hand-coded for errors by experienced speech-language pathologists).",
        "Specifically with regards to syntax, they calculated several frequency counts and ratios for different parts-of-speech and bound morphemes.",
        "There was one extension beyond treating each word individually: this involved searching for pre-defined collocations such as once upon a time or happily ever af-ter, which were found to occur more rarely in the patient transcripts than in the control transcripts.",
        "We present an alternative, automated method of analysis.",
        "We do not attempt to fully replicate the results of the manual studies, but rather provide a complementary set of features which can indicate grammatic abnormalities.",
        "Unlike previous computational studies, we attempt to move beyond single-word analysis and examine which patterns of syntax might indicate agrammatism.",
        "2.2 Using parse features to assess grammaticality Syntactic complexity metrics derived from parse trees have been used by various researchers in studies of mild cognitive impairment (Roark et al., 2011), autism (Prud?hommeaux et al., 2011), and child language development (Sagae et al., 2005; Hassanali et al., 2013).",
        "Here we focus specifically on the use of CFG production rules as features.",
        "Using the CFG production rules from statistical parsers as features was first proposed by Baayen et al. (1996), who applied the features to an authorship attribution task.",
        "More recently, similar features have been widely used in native language identification (Wong and Dras, 2011; Brooke and Hirst, 2012; Swanson and Charniak, 2012).",
        "Perhaps most relevant to the task at hand, CFG productions as well as other parse outputs have proved useful for judging the grammaticality and fluency of sentences.",
        "For example, Wong and Dras (2010) used CFG productions to classify sentences from an artificial error corpus as being either grammatical or ungrammatical.",
        "Taking a different approach, Chae and Nenkova 1 http://talkbank.org/AphasiaBank/ 135 Agrammatic (N = 24) Control (N = 15) Male/Female 15/9 8/7 Age (years) 58.1 (10.6) 63.3 (6.4) Education (years) 16.3 (2.5) 16.4 (2.4) Table 1: Demographic information.",
        "Numbers are given in the form: mean (standard deviation).",
        "(2009) calculated several surface features based on the output of a parser, such as the length and relative proportion of different phrase types.",
        "They used these features to distinguish between human and machine translations, and to determine which of a pair of translations was the more fluent.",
        "How-ever, to our knowledge there has been no work using parser outputs to assess the grammaticality of speech from individuals with post-stroke aphasia.",
        "3 Data 3.1 Participants This was a retrospective analysis of data collected by the the Aphasia and Neurolinguistics Research Laboratory at Northwestern University.",
        "All agrammatic participants had experienced a stroke at least 1 year prior to the narrative sample collection.",
        "Demographic information for the participants is given in Table 1.",
        "There is no significant (p < 0.05) difference between the patient and control groups on age or level of education.",
        "3.2 Narrative task To obtain a narrative sample, the participants were asked to relate the well-known fairy tale Cinderella.",
        "Each participant was first given a wordless picture book of the story to look through.",
        "The book was then removed, and the participant was asked to tell the story in his or her own words.",
        "The examiner did not interrupt or ask questions.",
        "The narratives were recorded and later transcribed following the NNLA protocol.",
        "The data was segmented into utterances based on syntactic and prosodic cues.",
        "Filled pauses, repetitions, false starts, and revisional phrases (e.g.",
        "I mean) were all placed inside parentheses.",
        "The average length of the raw transcripts was 332 words for agrammatic participants and 387 words for con-trols; when the non-narrative words were excluded the average length was 194 words for the agrammatic group and 330 for controls.",
        "4 Methods 4.1 Parser Features We consider two types of features: CFG production rules and phrase-level statistics.",
        "For the CFG production rules, we use the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000) trained on Wall Street Journal data to parse each utterance in the transcript and then extract the set of non-lexical productions.",
        "The total number of types of productions is large, many of them occurring very infrequently, so we compile a list of the 50 most frequently occurring productions in each of the two groups (agrammatic and controls) and use the combined set as the set of features.",
        "The feature values can be binary (does a particular production rule appear in the narrative or not?)",
        "or integer (how many times does a rule oc-cur?).",
        "The CFG non-terminal symbols follow the Penn Treebank naming conventions.",
        "For our phrase-level statistics, we use a subset of the features described by Chae and Nenkova (2009), which are related to the incidence of different phrase types.",
        "We consider three different phrase types: noun phrases, verb phrases, and prepositional phrases.",
        "These features are defined as follows: ?",
        "Phrase type proportion: Length of each phrase type (including embedded phrases), divided by total narrative length.",
        "?",
        "Average phrase length: Total number of words in a phrase type, divided by number of phrases of that type.",
        "?",
        "Phrase type rate: Number of phrases of a given type, divided by total narrative length.",
        "Because we are judging the grammaticality of the entire narrative, we normalize by narrative length (rather than sentence length, as in Chae and Nenkova's study).",
        "These features are real-valued.",
        "We first perform the analysis on the transcribed data with the dysfluencies removed, labeled the ?clean?",
        "dataset.",
        "This is the version of the transcript that would be used in the manual NNLA analysis.",
        "However, it is the result of human effort and expertise.",
        "To test the robustness of the system on data that has not been annotated in this way, we also use the ?raw?",
        "dataset, with no dysfluencies removed (i.e. including everything inside the parentheses), and an ?auto-cleaned?",
        "dataset, in which filled pauses are automatically removed from the raw transcripts.",
        "We also use a simple algorithm to remove ?stutters?",
        "and false starts, by 136 removing non-word tokens of length one or two (e.g. CC- Cinderella would become simply Cin-derella).",
        "This provides a more realistic view of the performance of our system on real data.",
        "We also hypothesize that there may be important information to be found in the dysfluent speech segments.",
        "4.2 Feature weighting and selection We assume that some production rules will be more relevant to the classification than others, and so we want to weight the features accordingly.",
        "Using term frequency?inverse document frequency (tf-idf) would be one possibility; how-ever, the tf-idf weights do not take into account any class information.",
        "Supervised term weighting (STW), has been proposed by Debole and Se-bastiani (2004) as an alternative to tf-idf for text classification tasks.",
        "In this weighting scheme, feature weights are assigned using the same algorithm that is used for feature selection.",
        "For ex-ample, one way to select features is to rank them by their information gain (InfoGain).",
        "In STW, the InfoGain value for each feature is also used to replace the idf term.",
        "This can be expressed as W (i,d) = df(i,d)?",
        "InfoGain(i), where W (i,d) is the weight assigned to feature i in document d, df(i,d) is the frequency of occurrence of feature i in document d, and InfoGain(i) is the information gain of feature i across all the training documents.",
        "We considered two different methods of STW: weighting by InfoGain and weighting by gain ratio (GainRatio).",
        "The methods were also used as feature selection, since any feature that was assigned a weight of zero was removed from the classification.",
        "We also consider tf-idf weights and un-weighted features for comparison.",
        "4.3 Syntactic complexity metrics To compare the performance of the parse features with more-traditional syntactic complexity metrics (SC metrics), we calculate the mean length of utterance (MLU), mean length of T-unit 2 (MLT), mean length of clause (MLC), and parse tree height.",
        "We also calculate the mean, maximum, and total Yngve depth, which measures the proportion of left-branching to right-branching in each parse tree (Yngve, 1960).",
        "These measures are commonly used in studies of impaired language (e.g. Roark et al. (2011), Prud?hommeaux et 2 A T-unit consists of a main clause and its attached dependent clauses.",
        "al. (2011), Fraser et al. (2013b)).",
        "We hypothesize that the parse features will capture more information about the specific impairments seen in agrammatic aphasia; however, using the general measures of syntactic complexity may be sufficient for the classifiers to distinguish between the groups.",
        "4.4 Classification To test whether the features can effectively distinguish between the agrammatic group and controls, we use them to train and test a machine learning classifier.",
        "We test three different classification algorithms: naive Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), and random forests (RF).",
        "We use a leave-one-out cross-validation framework, in which one transcript is held out as a test set, and the other transcripts form the training data.",
        "The feature weights are calculated on the training set and then applied to the test set (as a result, each fold of training/testing may use different features and feature weights).",
        "The SVM and RF algorithms are tuned in a nested cross-validation loop.",
        "The classifier is then tested on the held-out point.",
        "This procedure is repeated across all data points, and the average accuracy is reported.",
        "A baseline classifier which assigns all data to the largest class would achieve an accuracy of .62 on this classification task.",
        "For a more realistic measure of performance, we also compare our results to the baseline accuracy that can be achieved using only the length of the narrative as input.",
        "5 Results 5.1 Features using clean transcripts We first present the results for the clean transcripts.",
        "Although different features may be selected in each fold of the cross-validation, for simplicity we show only the feature rankings on the whole data set.",
        "Table 2 shows the top features as ranked by GainRatio.",
        "The frequencies are given to indicate the direction of the trend; they represent the average frequency per narrative for each class (agrammatic = AG and control = CT).",
        "Boldface indicates the group with the higher frequency.",
        "Asterisks are used to indicate the significance of the difference between the groups.",
        "When working with clinical data, careful examination of the features can be beneficial.",
        "By comparing features with previous findings in the literature on agrammatism, we can be confident that we are measuring real effects and not just artifacts 137 Rule AG freq CT freq p 1 PP?",
