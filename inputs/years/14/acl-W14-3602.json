        "This paper focuses on a project for building the first International Corpus of Arabic (ICA).",
        "It is planned to contain 100 million analyzed tokens with an interface which allows users to interact with the corpus data in a number of ways [ICA website].",
        "ICA is a representative corpus of Arabic that has been initiated in 2006, it is intended to cover the Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) language as being used all over the Arab world.",
        "ICA has been analyzed by Bibliotheca Alexandrina Morphological Analysis Enhancer (BAM- AE).",
        "BAMAE is based on Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzer (BAMA).",
        "Precision and Recall are the evaluation measures used to evaluate the BAMAE system.",
        "At this point, Precision measurement ranges from 95%-92% while recall measurement was 92%-89%.",
        "This depends on the number of qualifiers retrieved for every word.",
        "The percentages are expected to rise by implementing the improvements while working on larger amounts of data.",
        "1.",
        "Introduction Arabic is the largest member of the Semitic language family, most closely related to Arama-ic, Hebrew, Ugaritic and Phoenician.",
        "Arabic is one of the six official languages of the United Nations1 and it is the main language of most of the Middle East countries.",
        "Arabic ranks fifth in the world's league table of languages, with an estimated 206 million native speakers, 24 million as 2nd language speakers to add up to total of 233 million and World Almanac estimates the total speakers as 255 million.",
        "Arabic language is the official language in all Arab nations as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Algeria.",
        "Moreover, it is also an official language in non-Arab countries as Israel, Chad and Eritrea.",
        "It is also spoken as a 1http://www.un.org/en/aboutun/languages.shtml 2nd language in other non-Arab countries as Mali and Turkey2.",
        "The formal Arabic language, known as Classical Arabic is the language in which the Qur?an is written and is considered to be the base of the syntactic and grammatical norms of the Arabic language.",
        "However, today it is considered more of a written language than a spoken one.",
        "Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is similar to Classical Arabic, but it is an easier form.",
        "It is understood across the Arab world and it is used by television presenters and politicians, it is the form used to teach Arabic as a foreign language.",
        "There are different MSA varieties as the rate of similarity between every Arab country version of MSA and Classical Arabic differs.",
        "This is one of the issues that this paper will present.",
        "Due to the fact that the need for Arabic corpus is increasing as well as the fact that the trials to build an Arabic corpus in the last few years were not enough to consider that the Arabic language has a real, representative and reliable cor-pus, it was necessary to build such an Arabic corpus that is capable of supporting various linguistic research in Arabic.",
        "Thus, ICA was inspired by the difficulties that encountered Arabic Language researches as a result of the lack of publicly available Arabic corpora.",
        "Bibliotheca Alexandrina (BA) has initiated a big project to build the ?International Corpus of Arabic (ICA)?, a real trial to build a representative Arabic corpus as being used all over the Arab world to support research in Arabic.",
        "The International Corpus of Arabic is planned to contain 100 million words.",
        "The collection of samples is limited to written Modern Standard Ara-bic, selected from a wide range of sources and designed to represent a wide cross-section of Ar-abic; it is stimulating the first systematic investi-2http://www.vistawide.com/languages/top_30_langua ges.htm 8 gation of the national varieties as being used all over the Arab world (Alansary, et al. 2007).",
        "There were some trials for building Arabic corpora.",
        "Some of them were annotated corpora and others were raw texts corpora.",
        "Annotated corpora trails as Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB).",
        "The LDC was sponsored to develop an Arabic POS and Treebank of only 1,000,000 words.",
        "This corpus doesn't contain any branched genres except 600 stories from the ANNAHAR News Agency.",
        "The POS only annotated version of this ANNAHAR corpus was released in 20043.",
        "The output from Buckwalter's Arabic Morphological Analyzer is used as the starting point for the morphological annotation and POS tagging of Arabic newswire text (Maamouri M., 2004).",
        "Arabic Gigaword Corpus is an archive of newswire text data that depends on press only; it has been compiled from Arabic news sources by LDC4.",
        "The data coverage is limited, it was compiled from Egypt, Lebanon, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia and from outside the Arab world such as England.",
        "NEMLAR Annotated Written Corpus consists of about only 500, 000 words of Arabic text from 13 different categories, aiming to achieve a well-balanced corpus that offers a representation of the variety in syntactic, semantic and pragmatic features of modern Arabic lan-guage5.",
        "The accuracy of the automatic analysis is around 95% (Atiyya M. et al., 2005).",
        "Its analysis features are limited, moreover its use is restrict-ed; it is not accessible for commercial use6.",
        "KALIMAT is a free multipurpose Arabic corpus, consists of 18,167,183 annotated words representing 20,291 Arabic articles collected only from the Omani newspaper Alwatan.",
        "A morphological analysis process on the data collection using AL Khalil 7 morphological analyser was conducted to reach an accuracy of 96% (El-Haj M., 2013).",
        "Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank (PADT) version 1.0 distribution comprises over 113,500 tokens of data annotated analytically and provided with the disambiguating morphological information.",
        "In addition, the release includes complete annotations of MorphoTrees 3https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2005T20 4https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2003T12 5http://catalog.elra.info/product_info.php?products_id =873 6http://catalog.elra.info/product_info.php?products_id =873 7 http://alkhalil-morpho-sys.soft112.com/ resulting in more than 148,000 tokens, 49,000 of which have received the analytical processing8.",
        "The raw text corpora trails as (KACST) King Abdul-Aziz City for Science and Technology Corpus9 contains 732,780,509 words representing 869,800 text files and 7,464,396 distinct words.",
        "It contains a lot of classical Arabic texts; however, it is neither analyzed nor well planned.",
        "Ara-biCorpus 10 is a corpus that was developed by Dilworth Parkinson.",
        "It is a large corpus that could be accessed, but it is not analyzed.",
        "Words can be searched for in Arabic or Latin script.",
        "The website provides detailed instructions on the search.",
        "It contains 173,600,000 words in five main categories or genres: Newspapers, Modern Literature, Nonfiction, Egyptian Colloquial, and Premodern.",
        "In what follows, Section 2 reviews the ICA data design, how it is compiled, discuss the copyrights issue and what is the current ICA statistics.",
        "Section 3 describes the analysis stage of ICA, the tool that is used in the analysis, why was it chosen followed by ICA evaluation and a comparison with another morphological disambiguator.",
        "Section 4 gives a brief review on the ICA website for the researchers to query its data.",
        "Conclusions and suggestions for further work are given in section 5.",
        "2.",
        "ICA Design & Compilation Stage The ICA is similar to the International Corpus of English (ICE) in terms of concept rather than in design.",
        "They are similar in trying to include the varieties of the language; the Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) includes publications from every Arab country that uses Arabic as official language and it has been decided to include Arabic publications from outside the Arab nations.",
        "However, they are different in terms of corpus design criteria and data compilation.",
        "For exam-ple, on the one hand, Egyptian Modern Standard Arabic is the most widespread variety that is used to represent MSA in ICA corpus.",
        "On the other hand, in building ICE11 a fixed size from each variation was taken from any country that uses English as official language (one million words); however, balance in size does not always mean fixing a number of words for each variation as will be clarified in the next section.",
        "8https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004T23 9http://www.kacstac.org.sa/Pages/default.aspx 10http://arabicorpus.byu.edu/search.php 11http://ice-corpora.net/ICE/INDEX.HTM 9 It is important to realize that the creation of ICA is a \"cyclical\" process, requiring constant reevaluation during the corpus compilation.",
        "Con-sequently, we are willing to change our initial corpus design if there are any circumstances would arise that requires such changes.",
        "2.1 ICA Design ICA genre design relied on Dewey decimal classification of documents; however, this has been further classified to suit clear genre distinction rather than classifications for libraries.",
        "For example, Dewey decimal classification combines history and geography in one classification, while in ICA they are separated into two sub genres related to humanities genre.",
        "It has been designed to reflect a more or less real picture of how Arabic language exists in every field and in every country rather than relying on a theoretical image.",
        "ICA is designed to include 11 genres, namely; Strategic Sciences, Social Sciences, Sports, Reli-gion, Literature, Humanities, Natural Sciences, Applied Sciences, Art, Biography and Miscellaneous which are further classified into 24 sub-genres, namely; Politics, Law, Economy, Sociol-ogy, Islamic, Pros etc.",
        "Moreover, there are 4 sub-sub-genres, namely; Novels, Short Stories, Child Stories and plays.",
        "As shown in Figure 1.",
        "?Figure 1: ICA Genres?",
        "Planning of ICA data collection is based on some criteria related to corpus design such as representativeness, diversity, balance and size that were taken into the consideration.",
        "In collecting a corpus that represents the Arabic Language, the main focus was to cover the same genres from different sources and from all around the Arab nations.",
        "However, we decided to add Arabic data that belongs to the Arabic language even if they had been published outside as al-Hayat magazine which is published in London12.",
        "Size criterion in the corpus design focuses on the number of words.",
        "However, issues of size are also related to the number of texts from different genres, the number of samples from each text, and the number of words in each sample.",
        "Such decisions were taken based on how common the genre or the source is.",
        "Balance in a corpus has not been addressed by having equal amounts of texts from different sources or genres.",
        "It has been addressed by the factual distribution of the language real use.",
        "For example, Literature genre represents 12% and biography genre represents 2% from the corpus data distribution.",
        "2.2 Text Compilation and Categorization The International Corpus of Arabic has been compiled manually, and that enabled the corpus compilers to select all and only the MSA data rather than the colloquial Arabic data.",
        "Also, the ICA text categorization has been done manually according to the topic of the text and the distinct semantic features for each genre.",
        "These features keep the ICA data categorization objective rather than being subjective; depending on the compiler intuition.",
        "Accordingly, ICA texts can be considered as a good training data for text categorization system.",
        "ICA is planned to contain 100 million words.",
        "However, currently it is still around 80 million words.",
        "ICA data is composed of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) written texts.",
        "There are different resources for compiling the data.",
        "It has been decided to compile all available Arabic data written in MSA.",
        "ICA will be composed of four sources, namely; 1.",
        "Press source which is divided into three sub-sources, namely; (a) Newspapers, (b) Magazines which had been compiled from the official magazines along with newspapers that are written in MSA such as Al Ahram from Egypt, Addstour from Jordan, Al Hayat from Lebanon ?",
        "etc.",
        "finally the publications that have a printed copy as well as a soft electronic copy through world wide web such as (http://www.ahram.org.eg/), and (c) Electronic Press which had been compiled from magazines and newspapers that are written in MSA and have only soft electronic copy through world wide web.",
        "(2) Net articles which were compiled from forums and blogs that are also written in MSA.",
        "(3) Books which had been compiled from 12http://alhayat.com/AboutWebsite 10 all available books that are written in MSA and have a soft copy.",
        "(4) Academics which had been compiled from the scientific papers, researchers thesis, PhDs etc.. ?Figure 2: ICA Sources?",
        "2.3 Metadata Each compiled text has its own text encoding.",
        "This coding process for the text file names will customize the search scope at which level of the corpus this file belongs.",
        "For example, the following filename coding [AH10-A1.1.1_140207] can be clarified as shown in Table1: AH10 AH: Indicate the source of the text which is Ahram newspaper.",
        "10: This attached number that indicates that this file is the 10th article in that newspaper with the same genre, subgenre and date.",
        "A1.1.1 Contains three pieces of infor-mation: Newspaper source (A1), Strategic science \"genre\" (A1.1) and Politics \"sub-genre\" (A1.1.1).",
        "140207 Contains three pieces of issuing information: The day (14), the month (02) and the year (2007).",
        "?Table 1: An example of filenames coding?",
        "ICA Metadata covers the needed information related to Corpus for each compiled text as data source providers, Text code name, Text size, Website, date of publishing, publisher (name and country), writer (name, gender, age, nationality and educational level) and Collection/Annotation Specifications.",
        "2.4 Copyrights One of the serious constraints on developing large corpora and their widespread use is national and international copyright legalizations.",
        "According to copyright laws, it is necessary and sensible to protect the authors as well as the publishers rights of the texts that they had produced.",
        "ICA data Copy rights and publishing issues are in progress by Bibliotheca Alexandrina Legal Affairs.",
        "For that reason, the ICA data is not available to be downloaded but the researchers can search the ICA data via the ICA website13.",
        "2.5 ICA statistics Corpus analysis is both qualitative and quantitative.",
        "One of the advantages of corpora is that they can readily provide quantitative data which intuitions cannot provide reliably.",
        "The use of quantification in corpus linguistics typically goes well beyond simple counting.",
        "Table 2 shows some of the numbers of ICA data coverage.",
        "It must be noted that total number of ?Tokens?",
        "refers to all word forms except numbers, foreign words and punctuations to reflect the real size of the used word forms before the analysis stage.",
        "Coverage interval starts from 1993 up to 2014; however, there is a compilation problems as result of the data availability since the size of the data was not equal throughout the years.",
        "Balance is considered as an issue for the ICA current situation.",
        "It deals with the coverage of texts over the years rather than balance according to time span and that will remain as issue in the future.",
        "Statistics Total Number No.",
        "of texts 70,022 No.",
        "of words 79,569,384 No.",

        "ICA Analysis stage The first stage of linguistic analysis of the International corpus of Arabic is to analyze the 100 million words morphologically.",
        "The stem-based approach ?concatenative ap-proach?",
        "has been adopted as the linguistic approach.",
        "There are many morphological analyzers for Arabic; some of them are available for research and evaluation while the rest are proprietary commercial applications.",
        "Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzer (Buckwalter, 2004) is a well-known analyzer in the field`s literature and has even been considered as the ?most respected lexical resource of its kind?",

        "et al, 2005).",
        "It is used in LDC Arabic POS-tagger, Penn Arabic Dependency Treebank, and the Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank.",
        "It is designed to consist of a main database of word forms that interact with other concatenation databases.",
        "Every word form is entered separately, and the stem is used as the base form.",
        "The word is viewed as to be composed of a basic unit that can be combined with morphemes governed by morph tactic rules.",
        "It makes use of three lexicons: a Prefixes lexi-con, a Stem lexicon, and a Suffixes lexicon.",
        "Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzer (BAMA) has been selected since it was the most suitable lexical resource to our approach.",
        "(Alan- sary, et al. 2008).",
        "Although it has many advantages including its ability to provide a lot of information such as Lemma, Vocalization, Part of Speech (POS), Gloss, Prefix(s), Stem, Word class, Suffix(s), Number, Gender, Definiteness and Case or Mood, it does not always provide all the information that the ICA requires, and in some cases, the provided analyses would need some modification.",
        "Its results may give the right solution for the Arabic input word, provide more than one result that needs to be disambiguated to reach the best solution, provide many solutions but none of them is right, segment the input words wrongly without taking the segmentation rules in consideration or provide no solutions.",
        "Consequently, solutions enhancement is needed in these situations.",
        "Number, gender and definiteness need to be modified according to their morphosyntactic properties.",
        "Some tags had been added to Buck-walter's analyzer lexicon, some lemmas, glossaries had been modified and others had been added.",
        "In addition, new analysis and qualifiers had been added as root, stem pattern and name entities.",

        "Moreover, new features have been added in number as well as in definiteness qualifiers as the plural broken (PL_BR) and the EDAFAH features.",
        "These modifications and other new features were used in disambiguating two million words to be used as a training data extracted from the 12 ICA corpus to represent a sample of Arabic texts.",
        "After disambiguating the training date, some linguistic rules had been extracted, depending on the contexts, to help in the automatic disambiguation process of Bibliotheca Alexandrina Morphological Analysis Enhancer (BAMAE) as will be discusses in the next section.",
