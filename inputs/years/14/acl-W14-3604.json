        "This article proposes an annotation method of corpus data for the purposes of providing a constructionist account of lexical behavior.",
        "The lexical items in question are seven verbs of motion in Modern Standard Arabic that pertain to the events of COME (at?, ??",
        "?a, ?a?ara, and qadima) and GO (?ahaba, ma?",
        "?, and r??a).",
        "The tag set selected for the annotation of the COME and GO data frames consists of morphosyntactic tags that characterize verb usage as well as semantic tags that aim to highlight the semantic component of, for instance, adverbial and adpositional phrases that accompany the verb.",
        "I will briefly demonstrate the analytical potential of such data frame by discussing the various kinds of statistical tests such data frame is designed to undergo, as a means of better understanding lexical behavior in con-text, and, eventually, arriving at a better understanding of lexical and constructional choices made by native speakers of Arabic, as demonstrated in corpora."

        "The core tenets of constructionist theories of language claim that the basic unit of linguistic organization is a construction.",
        "According to Croft and Cruse (2004:257), a construction ?con- sist[s] of pairings of form and meaning that are at least partially arbitrary?, where ?meaning?",
        "is referred to as the conventionalized function of a construction.",
        "This conventionalization of a con-struction's meaning/function includes not only the literal meaning of an utterance, but also the discourse situation of that utterance, as well as any pragmatic implication conveyed by that utterance (Croft and Cruse, 2004).",
        "The concept of a ?construction?",
        "in cognitive approaches to grammar, therefore, relates to both the idiomatic portions of language, where the meaning of an utterance is not predictable from the component parts of which it consists (e.g. raining cats and dogs), as well as the co-occurrence of any two (free or bound) morphemes that reflect general morphosyntactic structures and where the meaning of an utterance is fully predictable from its component parts (e.g.",
        "I need to sleep).",
        "Such view of grammar postulates that ?the interaction of syntax and lexicon is much wider and deeper than the associations of certain verbs with certain complements?",
        "(Bybee, 2010:77), and that a considerable part of our linguistic knowledge consists of conventionalized expressions, or constructions (Langacker, 1987).",
        "In light of these constructionist assump-tions, therefore, the behavior of a lexical item is best understood in its context of use and not in isolation, an idea that stretches back decades (cf. Firth, 1957).",
        "This includes not only lexical collo-cates, but also the entire morphosyntactic frame that hosts a lexical item.",
        "All these elements contribute to the composed or conventionalized meaning/function expressed by a particular linguistic item.",
        "In order to examine lexical behav-ior, therefore, we need to move beyond single semantic, morphological, or syntactic properties of a lexical item and scrutinize the entire lexico-syntactic frame in which it occurs.",
        "Increasingly, this is done through examination of corpus data.",
        "The availability of corpora facilitates and motivates such highly contextualized analytical ap-proach, since corpora provide a large amount of naturally occurring, contextualized uses (as opposed to the reliance on introspective and elicited data that may not reflect actual language usage at all).",
        "Moreover, corpora provide large amounts of linguistic data, which allows the researcher to conduct extensive quantitative analyses of the phenomenon in question.",
        "In Modern Standard Arabic, the existence of several verbs denoting the motion events COME (at?, ??",
        "?a, ?a?ara, and qadima) and GO (?ahaba, ma?",
        "?, and r?",
        "?a) provides an excellent case study for a constructionist, corpus-based examination of the features that characterize the usage of supposedly near-synonymous lexical items.",
        "In Abdulrahim (2013) I have argued that the four COME verbs ?",
        "as well as the three GO verbs ?",
        "can be interchangeably used in contexts where the event depicts a strictly deictic and physical motion event, as in (1) and (2).",

        "?a.PERF.3SG.M ART=father-NOM ALL went the father to station ART=police station the police ?The father went to the police station?",
        "However, these verbs diverge greatly in their metaphorical and idiomatic uses, in addition to showing idiosyncratic patterns of lexico-syntactic behavior.",
        "For instance, The sentence in (1) would not admit all four verbs when the aspect inflection on the verb is changed.",
        "To illus-trate, in (3), if we hold all constructional features constant and change verb inflection from perfective to jussive, this results in a preference for at?",
        "and ?a?ara by native speakers of Arabic over ??",
        "?a or qadima.",

        "The above example stresses the need to investigate features of the lexico-syntactic construction that each COME verb most typically associates with.",
        "For these purposes, I have adopted the methodological approach outlined in Gries (2006), Gries & Divjak (2009), and Gries & Otani (2010) for a constructionist description of the Behavioral Profile of a lexical item.",
        "I have also employed logistic regression ?",
        "namely polytomous logistic regression, outlined in detail in Arppe (2008) ?",
        "as a statistical method that models lexical or constructional choices as a function of a wide range of contextual features.",
        "The quantitative approach to lexical analysis presented in this paper involves constructing a data frame for every lexical item under study, in which numerous corpus concordance lines are individually marked-up for an extensive set of linguistic features (morphological, syntactic, and semantic).",
        "This includes, for examples, specific elements pertaining to verb morphology, phrase structure, as well as the different elements that co-occur with the verb in specific constructions.",
        "Such data frame can undergo numerous exploratory and multi-variate statistical tests as a means of zeroing in on the kinds of constructions associated with the verbs in question.",
        "2 The corpus In order to construct the multi-variate data frame for the analysis of motion verbs in Arabic, I chose ArabiCorpus (arabicorpus.byu.edu) as the source for data.",
        "ArabiCorpus is a free online corpus developed by Dilworth Parkinson at Brigham Young University.",
        "As of October 2012, the corpus contains around 146,000,000 word tokens from different written and spoken genres.",
        "At the time of data collection (Fall 2010) the corpus contained around 69,000,000 word tokens.",
        "Additional MSA as well as pre-modern texts have been added to the corpus since the beginning of 2011.",
        "Texts included in ArabiCorpus almost exclusively belong to the written genre, save for a small sub-corpus of spoken Egyptian Arabic.",
        "The written genres covered in ArabiCorpus vary from newspaper writ-ing, pre-modern writing, modern literature, to nonfiction.",
        "These genres are represented in the corpus in varying proportions with newspaper writing accounting for over 90% of the total size of the entire corpus.",
        "News articles included in this sub-section of ArabiCorpus cover issues from 1996 to 2010 and are extracted from periodicals published in different parts of the Arab world (North Africa, Egypt, Arabian Gulf, the Levant, etc.).",
        "For this study, the MSA sub-corpora that were queried for COME and GO uses are related to newspaper, modern literature, and nonfiction writing.",
        "As expected, most examples returned from corpus queries were in fact drawn from the newspaper genre.",
        "ArabiCorpus is not tagged for parts-of-speech (POS) which makes the search for particular grammatical categories a daunting task.",
        "Nevertheless, it can be easily queried using regular expressions.",
        "This study targeted very specific inflected forms of the MSA verb: perfective, im-perfective, jussive, subjunctive, and imperative; and excluded participial forms (e.g. active parti-ciple) and nominal forms (e.g. verbal nouns).",
        "Relying on orthographic regular expressions, therefore, proved to be the most efficient method 29 for querying these particular forms.",
        "What may complicate any search in an Arabic written corpus is the lack of short vowels which are indicated by certain diacritics written over or underneath a letter.",
        "Naturally, it was necessary to filter corpus returns manually to eliminate any irrelevant forms that may have been returned in the corpus search.",
        "Despite the time-consuming nature of such corpus querying steps, ArabiCorpus proved to be a reliable and rich source for contextualized language uses.",
        "Add to that the fact that even though the online interface of ArabiCorpus only displays 10 words before and after the KWIC (key word in context), the researcher can still retrieve the entire text hosting that sentence.",
        "Therefore when the analysis or the annotation requires going beyond the 10 word window to examine the entire phrase structure, it is possible to retrieve such information from ArabiCorpus.",
        "Another added benefit of using the online interface of ArabiCorpus is the ease of downloading all returned hits of a certain lexical item or construction to be viewed in a spreadsheet, which was a major step in the collection of data for this research.",
        "3 COME and GO data frames In Abdulrahim (2013) I proposed a quantitative (as well as a qualitative) analysis based on the construction of a data frame for each one of the seven verbs of motion.",
        "Each individual data frame is typically composed of a large number of corpus concordance lines (500 concordance lines) involving the KWIC (i.e. verb under inves-tigation) in its natural context of use.",
        "Every concordance line is thoroughly examined and tagged for a wide range of morphosyntactic and semantic features.",
        "These constructional features include the syntactic structure that hosts the verb, the patterns of verbal inflections for every instance of verb use (e.g. subject number, person, and gender, as well as other morphosyntactic aspects of the Arabic verb), the semantic properties of other components of the construction (e.g. semantic properties of the subject), as well as the inclusion or exclusion of phrases, lexical items, or clitics denoting a starting point of the event (SOURCE), a terminal point of the event (GOAL), etc.",
        "Such a heavily annotated dataset has the potential of being explored statistically in multiple ways via simple frequency count methods as well as complex multi-variate statistical model-ing.",
        "Such quantitative approach to analyzing corpus data aims to define the specific characteristics of the constructions associated with the various meanings and functions of each MSA COME and GO verb involved in this study.",
        "In the following section I will elaborate on the selection of these contextual features for the annotation of COME and GO data frames.",
        "3.1 Selection of contextual features and the annotation of corpus data The first step for creating a multi-variate data frame is to generate a list of features or variables which are relevant to the motion event schemas in questions and which reflect the morphosyntax of Modern Standard Arabic.",
        "Along the lines of Gries's study on the polysemy of the English verb run (2006), Gries and Divjak's (2006) investigation of Russian verbs of TRY, as well as Gries and Otani's (2010) analysis of the synonymy and polysemy of adjectives of size in English, I developed a large set of mor-phological, syntactic, and semantic features that reflect the usage of MSA motion verbs.",
        "The variable set includes nominal variables (multiple levels) and binary variables (YES/NO values indicating absence or presence of feature).",
        "Table 1 shows the different categories of variables subsumed under morphological, syntactic, and semantic variables.",
        "In Appendix A, I provide examples and illustrations of the different annotations of levels within semantic variables taken from the actual data frame.",
        "1 Morphological variables Levels TENSE PRESENT, PAST, FUTURE, IRREALIS (non-finite forms) ASPECT SIMPLE, HABITUAL, PROGRES-SIVE, PERFECT, INCHOATIVE, NON-FIN (non-finite forms) MORPHOLOGICAL ASPECT AND MOOD OF THE VERB IMPERFECTIVE, PERFECTIVE, SUBJUNCTIVE, JUSSIVE, IMPERATIVE SUBJECT PERSON 1ST, 2ND, 3RD SUBJECT NUMBER SINGULAR, DUAL, PLURAL SUBJECT GENDER FEMININE, MASCULINE, NIL (for 1st person inflections) 1 The data frame was, in fact, coded for more variables than the set laid out in Table 4, such as the different morphosyntactic realizations of GOAL, SOURCE, MANNER, etc., as well as certain recurring lexical elements (e.g. ad-verbs, adverbial uses, and other lexical items).",
        "These additional variables did not form part of the quantitative analysis in Abdulrahim (2013).",
        "Nevertheless, they are of some interest and proved to be useful for a qualitative analysis of MSA motion verbs.",
        "30 Syntactic variables Levels TRANSITIVITY YES, NO INTERROGATIVE YES, NO NEGATIVE YES, NO PREPOSITIONAL PHRASE YES, NO LOCATIVE ADVERB PHRASE YES, NO ADVERBIAL PHRASE YES, NO SERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTION YES, NO Semantic variables Levels SUBJECT CATEGORY ACTIVITY, ANIMAL, ATTRIB-UTE, BODY, COGNITION, COM-MUNICATION, CONTENT (of a document/speech), DEMON-STRATIVE, DUMMY SUBJECT, EVENT, GROUP, HUMAN, LOCA-TION, NOTION, OB-JECT/ARTIFACT, SENSE, STATE, SUBSTANCE, TIME GOAL PHRASE YES, NO SOURCE PHRASE YES, NO MANNER PHRASE YES, NO SETTING PHRASE YES, NO PATH PHRASE YES, NO PURPOSIVE PHRASE YES, NO COMITATIVE PHRASE YES, NO TEMPORAL PHRASE YES, NO DEGREE PHRASE YES, NO Table 1.",
        "A selection of variables GO and COME corpus hits were coded for.",
        "As mentioned earlier, the primary motivation for this set of 23 linguistic features/tags has been the lexico-syntactic properties of deictic motion event schemas in MSA.",
        "For instance, a deictic motion event is likely to include a phrase specifying a GOAL and/or a SOURCE of the motion event.",
        "In addition, it may include MANNER of motion and the inclusion of a COMITATIVE phrase (i.e. accompaniment by an ob-ject/individual in the GO or COME event).",
        "Each verb usage was also coded for the semantic category of the sentential subject or, conceptually speaking, the moving entity involved in the motion event.",
        "These categories include HUMAN, OBJECT or ARTIFACT, and also more abstract/non-physical entities such as EVENT, COMMUNICATION (e.g. a statement), COGNITION (e.g. an idea), etc.",
        "As for the morphosyntactic features selected for tagging motion verbs, these reflect the inflectional properties of the MSA verb (MORPHOLOGICAL ASPECT AND MOOD, NUMBER, PERSON, and GENDER) as well as TENSE and ASPECT.",
        "The variable labeled TRANSITIVITY, only pertains to certain uses of COME verbs in MSA where COME verbs can appear in transitive constructions in which the direct object is the GOAL of the motion event.",
        "Text genre was not considered a variable since, as I mentioned earlier, the majority of the annotated 3,500 corpus hits belong to the genre of newspaper writing.",
        "Results obtained from examining this data frame should, therefore, be considered as mostly reflective of the usage of COME and GO verbs in newspaper writing.",

        "2 For in-stance, we can simply run the COME and GO data frames through mono-variate exploratory tests such as chi-square tests as a means of zeroing in on the distribution of contextual elements per each GO and COME verb.",
        "This kind of analysis would constitute a first step towards identifying divergence in usage patterns associated with each MSA motion verb.",
        "This preliminary step further motivates and justifies the examination of interaction patterns among the contextual features, as 2 See Hastie, T., et al (2009), and Agresti (2002) ?",
        "among others ?",
        "for comprehensive discussions on statistical tests that can be applied to multi-variate data frames.",
        "31 well as the identification of clusters of features that are closely tied to certain verb uses.",
        "A multivariate analysis eventually facilitates the identification of prototypical uses of each verb as well as the less prototypical uses.",
        "In the following I will briefly discuss three types of statistical methods that can be applied to the MSA COME and GO data frames: (i) chi-square test; (ii) cluster analysis; and (iii) polytomous logistic regression analysis.3 4.1 Chi-square tests The primary purpose of subjecting the COME and GO data frames to chi-square test of independence is to examine whether the distribution of the different levels of variables (tags) do not vary as a function of verb (null hypothesis), or, if they actually do vary as a function of verb (alternative hypothesis).",
        "For instance, if we examine the occurrence of a GOAL phrase per each GO verb, would the distribution of variables be the same or different across the three verbs.",
        "To test this hypothesis ?where we have an independent variable (verb) and a dependent variable (GOAL) ?we can run a chi-square test on variable distribution.",

        "We can also examine the cell-wise divergences from a uniform distribution for this particular contingency table by conducting a standardized Pearson's residual (discussed in Agresti 2002: 81; Arppe, 2008: 83-84).",

        "Therefore, what we expect to see from this statistical method is a clustering dendrogram that shows us which COME or GO verbs overlap in their usage as opposed to the ones with which they hardly share any characteristics.",

        "Generally speaking, logistic regression would estimate probabilities of the occurrence of each COME or GO verb given a particular context of use, and is therefore compatible with the view that linguistic choices are probabilistic rather than categorical (Bresnan, 2006; Arppe, 2007, 2008, 2009; among others).",
        "In a nutshell, polytomous logistic regression estimates variable parameters which can be interpreted ?naturally?",
        "as odds (Harrell 2001).",
        "In other words, it determines the extent to which the existence of a variable (i.e. feature/tag) in the context increases (or decreases) the chances of a particular outcome (i.e. verb) to occur, with all the other explanatory variables being equal.",
        "To illustrate, we can conduct such analysis on the annotated COME data frame.",
        "The first step is to select a set of variables to include in the model.",
        "Note, however, that the binary and nominal variables listed in Table 1 need to be converted into the form of logical variables in order to be included in the logistic regression model.",
        "The selection of these variables relies, first of all, on a mono-variate analysis (such as the inspection of standardized Pearson's residuals) as a means of figuring out which variables seem to have explanatory potential as opposed to those that do not.",
        "A second criterion for variable selection relies on inspecting pair-wise association patterns between variables.",
        "That is to say, we need to examine the extent to which certain variables have a high rate of co-occurrence, as a means of reducing collinearity in the regression model.",
        "The model listed in (5) includes 30 logical variables as the independent variables and the COME verb as a dependent variable.",

        "For instance, the variable TENSE has four levels: PRESNT / PAST / FUTURE / NIL.",
        "When turned into logical variables, we end up with four different variables (TENSE_PRESENT, TENSE_PAST, TENSE_FUTURE and TENSE_NIL), the presence or absence of which is indicated by TRUE or FALSE.",

        "The accuracy measure (Menard, 1995: 28-30; Arppe, 2008: 129-132) corresponds to the number of times the model assigned the highest probability estimate to the actually observed verb in a given annotated context.",
        "We can also examine the individual accuracy rates per verb as a means of zeroing in on which particular verb(s) the model was more successful in predicting.",
        "We can now examine the probability estimates that the polytomous logistic regression analysis assigns to each of the COME verbs per annotated context (4 verbs * 2,000 sentences).",
        "These estimated probabilities range from very high values (approaching 1.00) to very low values (approaching 0.00) and any values in be-tween, depending on the set of predictors (i.e. contextual features) present in a particular context of use.",
        "We can illustrate with sentences (6) and (7) which are extracted from the original data frame.",

        "It is, howev-er, used in transitive constructions to signal a shift in register, as in the example in (8).",
        "Since such pattern of use occurs less frequently than the general overall usage of qadima, the model assigns ?a?ara instead as the most plausible verb choice for such context.",
        "Careful inspection of ?mis-predictions?",
        "such as the above is, therefore, an important step to identify the less typical uses of verbs, as well as to decide whether the variable set chosen for the model has or has not been effective in accounting for verb usage.",
        "The probability estimates calculated for the GO data frame did not yield such satisfying results, and did not necessarily agree with my native speaker's intuition.",
        "In Abdulrahim (2013: 101) I attributed such findings to the set of variables that GO verbs were coded for in the data frame (which, more or less, resembled the variable set COME verbs were coded for).",
        "More specifically I suggested that the data frame should include more lexical or collocational variables.",
        "5 Conclusions The methodological approach to lexical analysis, described here, represents a departure from traditional, compartmentalized treatments of the Arabic verb.",
        "In this paper, I have adopted a construction-based approach that considers various aspects of language (morphology, syntax, semantics, etc.)",
        "as equally responsible for defin-35 ing the behavior of a linguistic item.",
        "The creation of a 500-row data frame per verb has allowed us to probe into the frequency and distribution facts regarding the usage of seven highly frequent motion verbs in MSA.",
        "Moreover, the annotation of each corpus return for a wide range of contextual and semantic features offered the possibility of foregrounding the most prototypical aspects of use for each verb, as well as highlighting shared patterns of usage among the near-synonymous verbs in a set.",
        "In this paper, I have argued that the value of constructing a data frame of this type lies in developing more sophisticated lexico-syntactic frames of linguistic items, in that it allows us to extract preferred profiles of the lexical or constructional items under study.",
        "Thankfully, there is a wide range of statistical tests that have made the examination of and search for lexico-syntactic patterns in large data frames easier and more manageable.",
        "These statistical tests vary from simple, mono-variate exploratory test to complex and multi-variate predictive models.",
        "Each one of the three statistical analyses discussed in this paper serves to highlight a particular aspect of variable distribution and variable interaction and, thus, helps us understand the complexity of the relationship between the near-synonymous COME and GO verbs.",
        "Generally speaking, the application of such statistical tests to large, multi-variate data frames helps us examine the particular linguistic features that characterize lexical and constructional choices, which may have direct applications in natural language generation.",
        "In addition, the identification of prototypical and marginal uses of verbs ?",
        "discussed particularly in 4.3 ?",
        "can possibly contribute to developing readability assessment of texts for learners of MSA.9 Finally, lexicographic treatments of the highly frequent motion verbs discussed in this paper, as exhibited in bilingual and, mostly, monolingual dictionaries, range from almost adequate to completely mis-representative descriptions of the major and minor senses of these verbs (Abdulrahim, 2013).",
        "Many monolingual dictionaries follow a traditional and highly ideological system of lexical representation whereby archaic uses of a lexical item are foregrounded and little attention is paid to more contemporary uses.",
        "The quantitative (and qualitative) analysis of a data frame such as the ones described here 9 I would like to thank an anonymous reviewers of this paper for pointing out these particular applications of the statistical methods discussed here.",
        "can help tease apart the different idiosyncratic uses for each of the seven motion verbs as well as identify the most and the least prototypical uses.",
        "One of the practical applications of such a data frame, therefore, is to create extensive, usage-based dictionary entries that are more representative of contemporary language use and that would be useful for the native speaker of the lan-guage, the language learner, and the language researcher.10 Acknowledgments I would like to thank Professors Antti Arppe, John Newman, and Sally Rice at the University of Alberta for their constant guidance and feedback throughout the various stages of the creation of this data frame, the application of statistical tests, and the linguistic analysis.",
