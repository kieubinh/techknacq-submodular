        "Abstract",
        "In this paper, Arabic diacritics restoration problem is tackled under the deep learning framework presenting Confused Subset Resolution (CSR) method to improve the classification accuracy, in addition to Arabic Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging framework using deep neural nets.",
        "Special focus is given to syntactic diacritiza-tion, which still suffer low accuracy as indicated by related works.",
        "Evaluation is done versus state-of-the-art systems reported in literature, with quite challenging datasets, collected from different domains.",
        "Standard datasets like LDC Arabic Tree Bank is used in addition to custom ones available online for results replication.",
        "Results show significant improvement of the proposed techniques over other approaches, reducing the syntactic classification error to 9.9% and morphological classification error to 3% compared to 12.7% and 3.8% of the best reported results in literature, improving the error by 22% over the best reported systems 1 Introduction Arabic is a wide spread language spoken by over 350 million people on the planet.",
        "Arabic alphabet and vocabulary are very rich, with the same word morphology being a candidate of different meanings and pronunciations.",
        "For example the word ???",
        "might bear the meaning of the person name ?Omar?",
        "??????",
        "or the meaning of ?age?",
        "??????.",
        "What distinguish them is the diacritization signs assigned to each character of the word.",
        "Diacritics are marks added on the character to reflect its correct pronunciation, according to grammatical, syntactical and morphological rules of the language.",
        "Nowadays, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) transcripts are written without diacritics, left to the ability of the reader to restore them from the context and knowledge.",
        "Diacritics restoration is not an easy task even for knowledgeable, native Arabic speakers.",
        "On the other hand, there are many machine learning tasks, like Text-To-Speech (TTS), translation, spelling correction, word sense disambiguation,?etc, that require diacritizing the script as a pre-processing step before applying the core application technique.",
        "In its basic form, the problem can be reduced to a pattern classification problem, with seven diacritics classes being the targets.",
        "In addition, the diacritics classification can be divided into syntactical diacritization, caring about case-ending and morphological diacritization, caring about the rest of the word diacritics.",
        "So far, morphological part of the problem is almost solved, leaving a marginal error of around 3-4%, Rashwan et al. (2009, 2011).",
        "On the other hand, syntactical diacritization errors are still high, hitting a ceiling that is claimed to be asymptotic and cannot be squeezed any further, Rashwan et al. (2009, 2011).",
        "For this reason, we focus our effort to squeeze this error beyond the least 12.5% error obtained in Rashwan et al. (2009, 2011).",
        "Recently, a significant advancement in the area of deep learning has been witnessed, with the development of a generative model; Deep Belief Nets (DBN), with a fast algorithm for inference of the model parameters.",
        "Deep Neural Networks (DNN) shall be the basic machine learning classifier used in this work, employing the latest results reached in the deep learning field.",
        "An efficient features?",
        "vector is designed under the umbrella of deep learning to distinguish different words diacritics.",
        "Features that are tested in the current work are: PoS, morphological quadruple of lexemes, last character and word identity.",
        "In addition, context features are essential to the diacritization problem.",
        "Context features include, the Mohsen A.",
        "Part-of-Speech (PoS) features are critical to syntactic diacritization, which is the focus of this work.",
        "For some datasets PoS tags are manually annotated by professional linguistics, while for the real case and most datasets, they are not available.",
        "For this reason, standalone PoS taggers are built under the deep learning framework, which can reused in Arabic PoS tagging systems, needed for many other applications, not only for Arabic diacritization.",
        "The deep learning model often hit a performance barrier which cannot be crossed.",
        "Hence, error analysis and diagnosis is run on the confusion matrix results, proposing the Confused Subset Resolution (CSR) method to train sub-classifiers to resolve the identified confusions and automatically generate a deep network-of-networks composed of the main classifier and the sub-classifiers working together to offer improved accuracy system purified of the identified confusions, offering around 2% error enhancement.",
        "Evaluation of the proposed techniques is done on two datasets; the first is a custom one collected from many different sources, which is available online at (http://www.RDI- eg.com/RDI/TrainingData is where to download TRN_DB_II).",
        "Manually extracted PoS and morphological quadruples are available for only a part of this dataset.",
        "The PoS tags of this part of the dataset were used to build the DNN PoS taggers to tag the rest of the dataset.",
        "The corresponding test set is available online at (http://www.RDI-eg.com/RDI/TestData is where to download TST_DB), which is quite challenging and collected from different sources than training ones.",
        "The second dataset is the standard LDC Arabic Tree Bank dataset LDC Arabic Tree Bank Part 3, (http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/catalogEntry.",
        "jsp?catalogId=LDC2005T20) used to bench mark the system against state-of-the art systems in Arabic diacritization area.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: first the related works in literature are surveyed, followed by a formulation of the CSR method.",
        "The next section is dedicated to describing the features used in the system, and how they are encoded and represented in the features?",
        "vector followed by the details of building the DNN PoS tagger for Arabic.",
        "The datasets used for evaluation are then described.",
        "The next section describes the system evaluation experiments.",
        "Experimental results include an error analysis study of the effect of each feature and method on the system performance, in addition to benchmarking against state-of-the art systems in literature, evaluated on standard datasets.",
        "Finally, the paper is concluded with the main results and conclusion.",
        "2 Related work There have been many attempts to approach the Arabic diacritization problem by different techniques.",
        "Focus will be around three works strongly related to what is proposed here, and having the best results in literature.",
        "Zitouni et al. (2006) apply Maximum Entropy classification to the problem taking the advantage of the MaxEnt framework to combine different features togeth-er, like lexical, segment-based, and PoS features.",
        "Segmentation involves getting the prefix, suffix, and stem of the word.",
        "PoS features are also generated under the MaxEnt framework.",
        "Habash and Rambow (2007) perform Morphological Analysis and Disambiguation of Arabic (MA- DA) system, and then apply SVM classification.",
        "Last, Rashwan et al. (2009 and 2011) propose a hybrid approach composed of two stages: first, maximum marginal probability via A* lattice search and n-grams probability estimation.",
        "When full-form words are OOV, the system switches to the second mode which factorizes each Arabic word into all its possible morphological constitu-ents, then uses also the same techniques used by the first mode to get the most likely sequence of morphemes, hence the most likely diacritization.",
        "The latter system shall be our baseline, since it gives the best results in literature so far, and the dataset used to evaluate it is available at our hand, and hence fair comparison is possible.",
        "Al-so, comparison to the three systems is made on the LDC Arabic Tree Bank data set.",
        "3 System architecture In this section the overall system is presented.",
        "The raw text input is fed to the system word by word.",
        "According to the configured context depth, a number of succeeding and preceding words are stored in a context memory.",
        "In our system the context is experimentally taken as three preceding words and one succeeding word (N=3, M=1), which is found to give the best accuracy results versus other tunings: (N=1, M=1), (N=2, M=2), (N=3, M=2), (N=1, M=3) and (N=1, M=3).",
        "If the word is the first or last one in a sentence, the pre-66 ceding or succeeding context is zero padded.",
        "Word context serves in case of syntactic diacriti-zation, while for morphological case, characters context is also needed, which is directly present in the character sequence of the single input word itself.",
        "Features extraction procedure depends on the feature itself.",
        "For PoS tags, a special DNN is trained for that purpose, which also makes use of the context of the word.",
        "For other features, like sequence of characters forming the word, the last character of the word and the morphological quadruples are directly extracted from the single word.",
        "The framework in Figure 2 is employed.",
        "Three layers network architecture is used for each features extraction subnet or classification network.",
        "For the classification network a 20-20-20 architecture was used, while for PoS-tagging networks a 60-60-60 is used.",
        "The network architecture is determined empirically.",
        "By experiments it was found that the best architecture is the symmetric one, with the same width for all layers.",
        "The best width is found to be the same as the average number of ones in the training set features vectors.",
        "The neural network training undergoes DBN pre training as in Hinton et al. (2006) for 20 epochs per layer, with batch size of 1000 examples each without mini batches.",
        "Momentum is used initially with 0.5 for the first 5 epochs and then raised to 0.9 for the next epochs.",
        "The discriminative fine tuning is performed using conjugate gradient minimization for 30 epochs.",
        "For the first 6 epochs, only the upper layer is adjusted, then the rest of the layers are trained for the next epochs.",
        "Once the features are ready of a certain raw word it is fed to the DNN classifier.",
        "The resulting confusion matrix from the training phase is then fed to the CSR method to generate the tree structure that improves the system accuracy.",
        "During testing phase, the raw input features are fed to the DNN classifier to obtain an initial guess of the target diacritic.",
        "This guess is then improved in the next CSR stage to obtain the final diacritic decision.",

        "However, this could lead to many out of vocabulary (OOV) cases, in addition to long vector.",
        "On the other hand, a word can be encoded as sequence of the identities of its composing characters, which is more efficient under the DNN framework to avoid OOV, because even if a word is not encountered during training, at least a similar one with a character less or more was encountered during training, generating nearly similar activation of the stochastic binary units and leading to similar result as the original word.",

        "As part of the proposed deep system, a PoS tagger for Arabic transcript is proposed as well using deep networks.",
        "The first contribution is the introduction of the Confused Sub-set Resolution (CSR) architecture to enhance the accuracy.",
        "Design of features vector played a key role in error improvement.",
        "Specifically, using features like last character identity had valuable contribution to error improvement by about 4%.",
        "Including class labels context features in autoregressive fashion has also good impact of 1.1% on error improvement.",
        "Finally, encoding of word as sequence of characters enables to reduce OOV cases and enhance the accuracy.",
        "CSR enables to purify the cross confusions between diacritics.",
        "A network-of-network architecture formed of group of classifiers, each working to resolve a set of confusions, is directly generated to enhance the overall accuracy by about 2%.",
        "The identified confusions and the architecture go smoothly with the grammatical and syntactical rules of the Arabic language.",
        "Evaluation of the proposed system is made on two different datasets; custom and standard, both available online to enable replicating the experiments.",
        "Details of features vectors formatting and the used features are presented to facilitate results re-generation.",
        "The standard LDC Arabic Tree Bank dataset is used to bench mark the system against the best three systems in literature, showing that our system outperforms all previously published baselines.",
        "The effect of each proposed method is presented separately.",
        "Results show improvements ranging from 1.2% to 2.8% over the best reported results representing 22% improvement of the error.",
