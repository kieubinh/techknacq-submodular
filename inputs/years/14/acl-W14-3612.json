        "This situation is exacerbated in the case of Arabic social media for two reasons.",
        "First, Arabic dialects, commonly used in social media, are quite different from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) phonologically, morphologically and lex-ically, and most importantly, they lack standard orthographies (Maamouri et.al.",
        "2014).",
        "Second, Arabic speakers in social media as well as discussion forums, Short Messaging System (SMS) text messaging and online chat often use a non-standard romanization called ?Arabizi?",
        "(Dar- wish, 2013).",
        "Social media communication in Arabic takes place using a variety of orthographies and writing systems, including Arabic script, Arabizi, and a mixture of the two.",
        "Although not all social media communication uses Arabizi, the use of Arabizi is prevalent enough to pose a challenge for Arabic NLP research.",
        "In the context of natural language processing of social media Arabic, transliterating from Arabizi of various dialects to Arabic script is a necessary step, since many of the existing state-of-the-art resources for Arabic dialect processing and annotation expect Arabic script input (e.g., Salloum and Habash, 2011; Habash et al. 2012c; Pasha et al., 2014).",
        "To our knowledge, there are no naturally occurring parallel texts of Arabizi and Arabic script.",
        "In this paper, we describe the process of creating such a novel resource at the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC).",
        "We believe this corpus will be essential for developing robust tools for converting Arabizi into Arabic script.",
        "93 The rest of this paper describes the collection of Egyptian SMS and Chat data and the creation of a parallel text corpus of Arabizi and Arabic script for the DARPA BOLT program.1 After reviewing the history and features in Arabizi (Section 2) and related work on Arabizi (Section 3), in Section 4, we describe our approach to collecting the Egyptian SMS and Chat data and the annotation and transliteration methodology of the Arabizi SMS and Chat into Arabic script, while in Section 5, we discuss the annotation results, along with issues and challenges we encountered in annotation.",
        "2 Arabizi and Egyptian Arabic Dialect 2.1 What is Arabizi?",
        "Arabizi is a non-standard romanization of Arabic script that is widely adopted for communication over the Internet (World Wide Web, email) or for sending messages (instant messaging and mobile phone text messaging) when the actual Arabic script alphabet is either unavailable for technical reasons or otherwise more difficult to use.",
        "The use of Arabizi is attributed to different reasons, from lack of good input methods on some mobile devices to writers?",
        "unfamiliarity with Arabic keyboard.",
        "In some cases, writing in Arabizi makes it easier to code switch to English or French, which is something educated Arabic speakers often do.",
        "Arabizi is used by speakers of a variety of Arabic dialects.",
        "Because of the informal nature of this system, there is no single ?correct?",
        "encoding, so some character usage overlaps.",
        "Most of the encoding in the system makes use of the Latin character (as used in English and French) that best approximates phonetically the Arabic letter that one wants to express (for example, either b or p corresponds to ?).",
        "This may sometimes vary due to regional variations in the pronunciation of the Arabic letter (e.g., j is used to represent ?",
        "in the Levantine dialect, while in Egyptian dialect g is used) or due to differences in the most common non-Arabic second language (e.g., sh corresponds to ?",
        "in the previously English dominated Middle East Arab countries, while ch shows a predominantly French influence as found in North Africa and Lebanon).",
        "Those letters that do not have a close phonetic approximate in the Latin script are often expressed using numerals or other characters, so that the numeral graphically 1 http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/I2O/Programs/Broad_Op erational_Language_Translation_%28BOLT%29.aspx approximates the Arabic letter that one wants to express (e.g., the numeral 3 represents ?",
        "because it looks like a mirror reflection of the letter).",
        "Due to the use of Latin characters and also frequent code switching in social media Arabizi, it can be difficult to distinguish between Arabic words written in Arabizi and entirely unrelated foreign language words (Darwish 2013).",
        "For example, mesh can be the English word, or Arabizi for ??",
        "?not?.",
        "However, in context these cases can be clearly labeled as either Arabic or a foreign word.",
        "An additional complication is that many words of foreign origin have become Arabic words (?borrowings?).",
        "Examples include banadoora ??????",
        "?tomato?",
        "and mobile ??????",
        "?mobile phone?.",
        "It is a well-known practical and theoretical problem to distinguish borrowings (foreign words that have become part of a language and are incorporated fully into the morphological and syntactic system of the host lan-guage) from actual code switching (a bilingual writer switches entirely to a different language, even if for only a single word).",
        "Code switching is easy to identify if we find an extended passage in the foreign language which respects that lan-guage's syntax and morphology, such as Bas eh ra2yak I have the mask.",
        "The problem arises when single foreign words appear without Arabic morphological marking: it is unclear if the writer switched to the foreign language for one word or whether he or she simply is using an Arabic word of foreign origin.",
        "In the case of banadoora ??????",
        "?tomato?, there is little doubt that this has become a fully Arabic word and the writer is not code switching into Italian; this is also signaled by the fact that a likely Arabizi spelling (such as banadoora) is not in fact the Italian orthography (pomodoro).",
        "However, the case is less clear cut with mobile ??????",
        "?mobile phone?",
        ": even if it is a borrowing (clearly much more recent than banadoora ??????",
        "?tomato?",
        "), a writer will likely spell the word with the English orthography as mobile rather than write, say, mubail.",
        "More research is needed on this issue.",
        "However, because of the difficulty of establishing the difference between code switching and borrowing, we do not attempt to make this distinction in this annotation scheme.",
        "2.2 Egyptian Arabic Dialect Arabizi is used to write in multiple dialects of Arabic, and differences between the dialects themselves have an effect on the spellings chosen by individual writers using Arabizi.",
        "Because Egyptian Arabic is the dialect of the corpus cre-94 ated for this project, we will briefly discuss some of the most relevant features of Egyptian Arabic with respect to Arabizi transliteration.",
        "For a more extended discussion of the differences between MSA and Egyptian Arabic, see Habash et al. (2012a) and Maamouri et al. (2014).",
        "Phonologically, Egyptian Arabic is characterized by the following features, compared with MSA: (a) The loss of the interdentals /?/ and /?/ which are replaced by /d/ or /z/ and /t/ or /s/ respectively, thus giving those two original consonants a heavier load.",
        "Examples include ???",
        "/zakar/ ?to mention?, ???",
        "/daba?/ ?to slaughter?, ???",
        "/talg/ ?ice?, ???",
        "/taman/ ?price?, and ???",
        "/sibit/ ?to stay in place, become immobile?.",
        "(b) The exclusion of /q/ and /?/ from the consonantal system, being replaced by the /?/ and /g/, e.g., ???",
        "/?u?n/ ?cotton?, and ???",
        "/gamal/ ?camel?.",
        "At the level of morphology and syntax, the structures of Egyptian Arabic closely resemble the overall structures of MSA with relatively minor differences to speak of.",
        "Finally, the Egyptian Arabic lexicon shows some significant elements of semantic differentiation.",
        "The most important morphological difference between Egyptian Arabic and MSA is in the use of some Egyptian clitics and affixes that do not exist in MSA.",
        "For instance, Egyptian Arabic has the future proclitics h+ and ?+ as opposed to the standard equivalent s+.",
        "Lexically, there are lexical differences between Egyptian Arabic and MSA where no etymological connection or no cognate spelling is available.",
        "For example, the Egyptian Arabic ??",
        "/bu?",
        "?/ ?look?",
        "is ????",
        "/?unZur/ in MSA.",
        "3 Related Work Arabizi-Arabic Script Transliteration Previous efforts on automatic transliterations from Arabizi to Arabic script include work by Chalabi and Gerges (2012), Darwish (2013) and Al-Badrashiny et al. (2014).",
        "All of these approaches rely on a model for character-to-character mapping that is used to generate a lattice of multiple alternative words which are then selected among using a language model.",
        "The training data used by Darwish (2013) is publicly available but it is quite limited (2,200 word pairs).",
        "The work we are describing here can help substantially improve the quality of such system.",
        "We use the system of Al-Badrashiny et al. (2014) in this paper as part of the automatic transliteration step because they target the same conventional orthography of dialectal Arabic (CODA) (Habash et al., 2012a, 2012b), which we also target.",
        "There are several commercial products that convert Arabizi to Arabic script, namely: Microsoft Maren, 2 Google Ta3reeb, 3 Basis Arabic chat translator4 and Yamli.5 Since these products are for commercial purposes, there is little information available about their approaches, and whatever resources they use are not publicly available for research purposes.",
        "Furthermore, as Al-Badrashiny et al. (2014) point out, Maren, Ta3reeb and Yamli are primarily intended as input method support, not full text transliteration.",
        "As a result, their users?",
        "goal is to produce Arabic script text not Arabizi text, which affects the form of the romanization they utilize as an intermediate step.",
        "The differences between such ?functional romanization?",
        "and real Arabizi include that the users of these systems will use less or no code switching to English, and may employ character sequences that help them arrive at the target Arabic script form faster, which otherwise they would not write if they were targeting Arabizi (Al-Badrashiny et al., 2014).",
        "Name Transliteration There has been some work on machine transliteration by Knight and Graehl (1997).",
        "Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002) introduced an approach for machine transliteration of Arabic names.",
        "Freeman et al. (2006) also introduced a system for name matching between English and Arabic.",
        "Although the general goal of transliterating from one script to another is shared between these efforts and ours, we are considering a more general form of the problem in that we do not restrict ourselves to names.",
        "Code Switching There is some work on code switching between Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and dialectal Arabic (DA).",
        "Zaidan and Callison-Burch (2011) were interested in this problem at the inter-sentence level.",
        "They crawled a large dataset of MSA-DA news com-mentaries, and used Amazon Mechanical Turk to annotate the dataset at the sentence level.",
        "Elfardy et al. (2013) presented a system, AIDA, that tags each word in a sentence as either DA or MSA based on the context.",

        "To protect privacy, participation was completely anonymous, and demographic information was not collected.",
        "Participants completed a brief language test to verify that they were native Egyptian Arabic speakers.",
        "On average, each participant contributed 48K words.",
        "The Egyptian Arabic SMS and Chat collection consisted of 2,140 conversations in a total of 475K words after manual auditing by native speakers of Egyptian Arabic to exclude inappropriate messages and messages that were not Egyptian Arabic.",
        "96% of the collection came from the personal SMS or Chat archives of participants, while 4% was collected through LDC's platform, which paired participants and captured their live text messaging (Song et al., 2014).",

        "96 only 15% of conversations are entirely written in Arabic script, while 66% are entirely Arabizi.",
        "The remaining 19% contain a mixture of the two at the conversation level.",
        "Most of the mixed conversations were mixed in the sense that one side of the conversation was in Arabizi and the other side was in Arabic script, or in the sense that at least one of the sides switched between the two forms in mid-conversation.",
        "Only rarely are individual messages in mixed scripts.",
        "The annotation for this project was performed on the Arabizi tokens only.",
        "Arabic script tokens were not touched and were kept in their original forms.",
        "The use of Arabizi is predominant in the SMS and Chat Egyptian collection, in addition to the presence of other typical cross-linguistic text effects in social media data.",
        "For example, the use of emoticons and emoji is frequent.",
        "We also observed the frequent use of written out representations of speech effects, including representations of laughter (e.g., hahaha), filled pauses (e.g., um), and other sounds (e.g., hmmm).",
        "When these representations are written in Arabizi, many of them are indistinguishable from the same representations in English SMS data.",
        "Neologisms are also frequently part of SMS/Chat in Egyptian Arabic, as they are in other languages.",
        "English words use Arabic morphology or determiners, as in el anniversary ?the anniversary?.",

        "Arabizi Annotation and Transliteration Tool The annotators were presented with the source conversations in their original Arabizi form as well as the transliteration output from an automatic Arabization system, and used a web-based tool developed by LDC (see Figure 1) to perform the two annotation tasks, which allowed annotators perform both annotation and transliteration token by token, sentence by sentence and review the corrected transliteration in full context.",
        "The GUI shows the full conversation in both the original Arabizi and the resulting Arabic script transliteration for each sentence.",
        "Annotators must 97 annotate each sentence in order, and the annotation is displayed in three columns.",
        "The first column shows the annotation of flag features on the source tokens, the second column is the working panel where annotators correct the automatic transliteration and retokenize, and the third column displays the final corrected and retokenized result.",
        "Annotation was performed according to annotation guidelines developed at the Linguistic Data Consortium specifically for this task (LDC, 2014).",
        "4.3 Automatic Transliteration To speed up the annotation process, we utilized an automatic Arabizi-to-Arabic script transliteration system (Al-Badrashiny et al., 2014) which was developed using a small vocabulary of 2,200 words from Darwish (2013) and an additional 6,300 Arabic-English proper name pairs (Buck- walter, 2004).",
        "The system has an accuracy of 69.4%.",
        "We estimate that using this still allowed us to cut down the amount of time needed to type in the Arabic script version of the Arabizi by two-thirds.",
        "This system did not identify Foreign words or Names and transliterated all of the words.",
        "In one quarter of the errors, the provided answer was plausible but not CODA-compliant (Al-Badrashiny et al., 2014).",
        "4.4 Annotation on Arabizi Source Text to Flag Features This annotation was performed only on sentences containing Arabizi words, with the goal of tagging any words in the source Arabizi sentences that would be kept the same in the output of an English translation with the following flags: ?",

        "This meant that annotators were required to confirm both (1) that the word was transliterated into Arabic script correctly and also (2) that the transliterated word conformed to CODA standards.",
        "The automatic transliteration was provided to the annotators, and manually corrected by annotators as needed.",
        "Correcting spelling to a single standard (CO- DA), however, necessarily included some degree of normalization of the orthography, as the annotators had to correct from a variety of dialect spellings to a single CODA-compliant spelling for each word.",
        "Because the goal was to reach a consistent representation of each word, orthographic normalization was almost the inevitable effect of correcting the automatic transliteration.",
        "This consistent representation will allow downstream annotation tasks to take better advantage of the SMS/Chat data.",
