        "In this work, we address the problem of spelling correction in the Arabic language utilizing the new corpus provided by QALB (Qatar Arabic Language Bank) project which is an annotated corpus of sentences with errors and their corrections.",
        "The corpus contains edit, add before, split, merge, add after, move and other error types.",
        "We are concerned with the first four error types as they contribute more than 90% of the spelling errors in the corpus.",
        "The proposed system has many models to address each error type on its own and then integrating all the models to provide an efficient and robust system that achieves an overall recall of 0.59, precision of 0.58 and F1 score of 0.58 including all the error types on the development set.",
        "Our system participated in the QALB 2014 shared task ?Automatic Arabic Error Correction?",

        "The Arabic language is a highly inflected natural language that has an enormous number of possible words (Othman et al., 2003).",
        "And although it is the native language of over 300 million people, it suffers from the lack of useful resources as opposed to other languages, specially English and until now there are no systems that cover the wide range of possible spelling errors.",
        "Fortunately the QALB corpus (Zaghouani et al., 2014) will help enrich the resources for Arabic language generally and the spelling correction specifically by providing an annotated corpus with corrected sentences from user comments, native student essays, non-native data and machine translation data.",
        "In this work, we are trying to use this corpus to build an error correction system that can cover a range of spelling errors.",
        "This paper is a system description paper that is submitted in the EMNLP 2014 conference shared task ?Automatic Arabic Error Correction?",
        "(Mohit et al., 2014) in the Arabic NLP workshop.",
        "The challenges that faced us while working on this system was the shortage of contribution in the area of spelling correction in the Arabic language.",
        "But hopefully the papers and the work in this shared task specifically and in the workshop generally will enrich this area and flourish it.",
        "Our system targets four types of spelling errors, edit errors, add before errors, merge errors and split errors.",
        "For each error type, A model is built to correct erroneous words detected by the error detection technique.",
        "Edit errors and add before errors are corrected using classifiers with contextual features, while the merge and split errors are corrected by inserting or omitting a space between words and choosing the best candidate based on the language model score of each candidate.",
        "The rest of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "In section 2, we give a brief background on related work in spelling correction.",
        "In section 3, we introduce our system for spelling correction with the description of the efficient models used in the system.",
        "In section 4, we list some experimental results on the development set.",
        "In section 5, we give some concluding remarks.",
        "2 Related Work The work in the field of spelling correction in the Arabic language is not yet mature and no system achieved a great error correction efficiency.",
        "Even Microsoft Word, the most widely used Arabic spelling correction system, does not achieve good results.",
        "Our work was inspired by a number of papers.",
        "(Shaalan et al., 2012) addressed the problem of Arabic Word Generation for spell checking and they produced an open source and 121 large coverage word list for Arabic containing 9 million fully inflected surface words and applied language models and Noisy Channel Model and knowledge-based rules for error correction.",
        "This word list is used in our work besides using language models and Noisy Channel Model.",
        "(Shaalan et al., 2010) proposed another system for cases in which the candidate generation using edit algorithm only was not enough, in which candidates were generated based on transformation rules and errors are detected using BAMA (Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Ana-lyzer)(Buckwalter, 2002).",
        "(Khalifa et al., 2011) proposed a system for text segmentation.",
        "The system discriminates between waw wasl and waw fasl, and depending on this it can predict if the sentence to be segmented at this position or not, they claim that they achieved 97.95% accuracy.",
        "The features used in this work inspired us with the add before errors correction.",
        "(Schaback, 2007) proposed a system for the English spelling correction, that is addressing the edit errors on various levels: on the phonetic level using Soundex algorithm, on the character level using edit algorithm with one operation away, on the word level using bigram language model, on the syntactic level using collocation model to determine how fit the candidate is in this position and on the semantic level using co-occurrence model to determine how likely a candidate occurs within the given context, using all the models output of candidate word as features and using SVM model to classify the candidates, they claim reaching recall ranging from 90% for first candidate and 97% for all five candidates presented and outperforming MS Word, Aspell, Hunspell, FST and Google.",
        "3 Proposed System We propose a system for detecting and correcting various spelling errors, including edit, split, merge, and add before errors.",
        "The system consists of two steps: error detection and error correction.",
        "Each word is tested for correctness.",
        "If the word is deemed incorrect, it is passed to the correction step, otherwise it remains unchanged.",
        "The correction step contains specific handling for each type of error, as detailed in subsection 3.3.",
        "3.1 Resources Dictionary: Arabic wordlist for spell checking 1 is a free dictionary containing 9 million Arabic words.",
        "The words are automatically generated from the AraComLex 2 open-source finite state transducer.",
        "The dictionary is used in the generation of candidates and using a special version of MADAMIRA 3 (Pasha et al., 2014) created for the QALB shared task using a morphological database based on BAMA 1.2.1 4 (Buckwalter, 2002).",
        "Features are extracted for each word of the dictionary to help in the proposed system in order that each candidate has features just like the words in the corpus.",

        "QALB Corpus: QALB shared task offers a new corpus for spelling correction.",
        "The corpus contains a large dataset of manually corrected Arabic sentences.",
        "Using this corpus, we were able to implement a spelling correction system that targets the most frequently occurring error types which are (a) edit errors where a word is replaced by another word, (b) add before errors where a word was removed, (c) merge errors where a space was inserted mistakenly and finally (d) split errors where a space was removed mistakenly.",
        "The corpus provided also has three other error types but they occur much less frequently happen which are (e) add after errors which is like the add before but the token removed should be put after the word, (f) move errors where a word should be moved to other place within the sentence and (g) other errors where any other error that does 1 http://sourceforge.net/projects/ arabic-wordlist/ 2 http://aracomlex.sourceforge.net/ 3 MADAMIRA-release-20140702-1.0 4 AraMorph 1.2.1 - http://sourceforge.net/ projects/aramorph/ 5 http://sourceforge.net/projects/ arabicstopwords/ 6 http://aracorpus.e3rab.com/ argistestsrv.nmsu.edu/AraCorpus/ 122 not lie in the six others is labeled by it.",

        "Using the Buckwalter morphological analysis (Buckwalter, 2002) feature, we determine if a word is correct or not.",
        "If the word has no analysis, we consider the word as incorrect and pass it through the correction process.",
        "3.3 Edit Errors Correction The edit errors has the highest portion of total errors in the corpus.",
        "It amounts to more than 55% of the total errors.",
        "To correct this type of errors, we train a classifier with features like the error model probability, collocation and co-occurrence as fol-lows: Undiacriticized word preprocessed: Utilizing the MADAMIRA features of each word, the undiacriticized word fixes some errors like hamzas, the pair of haa and taa marboutah and the pair of yaa and alif maqsoura.",
        "We apply some preprocessing on the undiacriticized word to make it more useful and fix the issues associated with it.",
        "For example we remove the incorrect redundant characters from the word e.g (?",

        "@ ?",
        "?Ag .",

        "?).",
        "Language Model: For each candidate, A un-igram, bigram and trigram values from the language model trained are retrieved.",
        "In addition to a feature that is the product of the unigram, bigram and trigram values.",
        "Likelihood Model: The likelihood model is trained by iterating over the training sentences counting the occurrences of each edit with the characters being edited and the type of edit.",
        "The output of this is called a confusion matrix.",
        "The candidate score is based on the Noisy Channel Model (Kernighan et al., 1990) which is the multiplication of probabilty of the proposed edit using the confusion matrix trained which is called the error model, and the language model score of that word.",
        "The language model used is unigram, bigram and trigram with equal weights.",
        "Add-1 smoothing is used for both models in the counts.",
        "Score = p(x|w).p(w) where x is the wrong word and w is the candidate correction.",
        "For substitution edit candidates, we give higher score for substitution of a character that is close on the keyboard or the substitution pair belongs to the same group of letter groups (Shaalan et al., 2012) by multiplying the score by a constant greater than one.",
