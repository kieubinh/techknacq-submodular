        "Any token that matches an element of the dictionary, possibly after some minimal morphological analysis, is deemed to be correctly spelled; any token that matches no element is flagged as a possible error, with near-matches displayed as suggested corrections (Hirst, 2005).",

        "as the user types, replacing them with a ?correction?",
        "and giving no indication or warning of the change.",
        "Such mechanisms are intended for undoubted typing errors for which only one correction is plausible, such as correcting acco-modate* to accommodate (Hirst, 2005).",
