        "The business of text creation and editing represents a large market where NLP technologies might be applied naturally (Dale, 1997).",
        "Today's users of word processors get surprisingly little help in checking spelling, and a small number of them use more sophisticated tools such as grammar checkers, to provide help in ensuring that a text remains grammatically accurate after modification.",
        "For instance, in the Arabic version of Microsoft Word, the spelling checker for Arabic, does not give reasonable and natural proposals for many real-word errors and even for simple probable errors (Had- dad and Yaseen, 2007).",
        "With the increased usage of computers in the processing of natural languages comes the need for correcting errors introduced at different stages.",
        "Natural language errors are not only made by human operators at the input stage but also by NLP systems that produce natural language output.",
        "Machine translation (MT), or optical character recognition (OCR), often produce incorrect output riddled with odd lexical choices, grammar errors, or incorrectly recognized characters.",
        "Correcting human/machine-produced er-rors, or post-editing, can be manual or automated.",
        "For morphologically and syntactically complex languages, such as Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), correcting texts automatically requires complex human and machine processing which makes generation of correct candidates a challenging task.",
        "For instance, the Automatic Arabic Text Correction Shared Task is an interesting testbed to develop and evaluate spelling correction systems for Arabic trained either on naturally occurring errors in texts written by humans (e.g., non-native speakers), or machines (e.g., MT output).",
        "In such tasks, participants are asked to implement a system that takes as input Modern Standard Arabic texts with various spelling errors and automatically correct them.",
        "In this paper, we describe the CMUQ system we developed to participate in the The First Shared Task on Automatic Text Correction for Arabic (Mohit et al., 2014).",
        "Our system combines rule-based linguistic techniques with statistical language modeling techniques and machine translation-based methods.",
        "Our system outperforms the baseline, achieves a better correction quality and reaches an F-score of 62.96% on the development set of QALB corpus (Zaghouani et al., 2014) and 65.42% on the test set.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "First, we review the main previous efforts for automatic spelling correction, in Section 2.",
        "In Section 3, we describe our system, which consists of several modules.",
        "We continue with our experiments on the shared task 2014 dev set (Section 4).",
        "Then, we give an analysis of our system output in Section 5.",
        "Finally, we conclude and hint towards future improvement of the system, in Section 6.",
        "2 Related Work Automatic error detection and correction include automatic spelling checking, grammar checking and post-editing.",
        "Numerous approaches (both supervised and unsupervised) have been explored to improve the fluency of the text and reduce the percentage of out-of-vocabulary words using NLP tools, resources, and heuristics, e.g., morphological analyzers, language models, and edit-distance measure (Kukich, 1992; Oflazer, 1996; Zribi and Ben Ahmed, 2003; Shaalan et al., 2003; Haddad and Yaseen, 2007; Hassan et al., 2008; Habash, 2008; Shaalan et al., 2010).",
        "There has been a lot of work on error correction for English (e.g., (Golding and Roth, 1999)).",
        "Other approaches learn models of correction by training on paired examples of errors and their corrections, which is the main goal of this work.",
        "For Arabic, this issue was studied in various directions and in different research work.",
        "In 2003, Shaalan et al. (2003) presented work on the specification and classification of spelling errors in Arabic.",
        "Later on, Haddad and Yaseen (2007) presented a hybrid approach using morphological features and rules to fine 137 tune the word recognition and non-word correction method.",
        "In order to build an Arabic spelling checker, Attia et al. (2012) developed semi-automatically, a dictionary of 9 million fully inflected Arabic words using a morphological transducer and a large corpus.",
        "They then created an error model by analyzing error types and by creating an edit distance ranker.",
        "Finally, they analyzed the level of noise in different sources of data and selected the optimal subset to train their system.",
        "Alkanhal et al. (2012) presented a stochastic approach for spelling correction of Arabic text.",
        "They used a context-based system to automatically correct misspelled words.",
        "First of all, a list is generated with possible alternatives for each misspelled word using the Damerau-Levenshtein edit distance, then the right alternative for each misspelled word is selected stochastically using a lattice search, and an n-gram method.",
        "Shaalan et al. (2012) trained a Noisy Channel Model on word-based unigrams to detect and correct spelling errors.",
        "Dahlmeier and Ng (2012a) built specialized decoders for English grammatical error correction.",
        "More recently, (Pasha et al., 2014) created MADAMIRA, a system for morphological analysis and disambiguation of Arabic, this system can be used to improve the accuracy of spelling checking system especially with Hamza spelling correction.",
        "In contrast to the approaches described above, we use a machine translation (MT) based method to train an error correction system.",
        "To the best of our knowl-edge, this is the first error correction system for Arabic using an MT approach.",
        "3 Our System Our system is a pipeline that consists of several different modules.",
        "The baseline system uses a spelling checking module, and the final system uses a phrase-based statistical machine translation system.",
        "To preproces the text, we use the provided output of MADAMIRA (Pasha et al., 2014) and a rule-based correction.",
        "We then do a rule-based post-processing to fix the punctuation.",
        "3.1 Baseline Systems For the baseline system, we try a common spelling checking approach.",
        "We first pre-process the data using the features from MADAMIRA (see Feature 14 Replacement), then we use a noisy channel model for spelling checking.",
        "Feature 14 Replacement The first step in the pipeline is to extract MADAMIRA's 14th feature from the .column file and replace each word in the input text with this form.",
        "MADAMIRA uses morphological disambiguation and SVM analysis to select the most likely fully diacritized Arabic word for the input word.",
        "The 14th feature represents the undiacritized form of the most likely word.",
        "This step corrects many Hamza placement or omission errors, which makes a good base for other correction modules.",
        "Spelling Correction The spelling checker is based on a noisy channel model we use a word list and language model to determine the most probable correct Arabic word that could have generated the incorrect form that we have in the text.",
        "For detecting spelling errors we use the AraComLex word list for spelling checking (Attia et al., 2012), which contains about 9 million Arabic words.",
        "1 We look up the word from the input sentence in this list, and attempt to correct those that are not found in the list.",
        "We also train a mapping of incorrect words and possible corrections from the edits in the training data.",
        "If the word is in this map, the list of possible corrections from the training data becomes the candidate list.",
        "If the word is not in the trained map, the candidate list is created by generating a list of words with common insertions, substitutions, and deletions, according to the list in (Attia et al., 2012).",
        "Each candidate is generated by performing these edits and has a weight according to the edit distance weights in the list.",
        "We then prune the candidate list by keeping only the lowest weight words, and removing candidates that are not found in the word list.",
        "The resulting sentence is scored with a 3-gram language model built with KenLM (Heafield et al., 2013) on the correct side of the training data.",
        "The top one sentence is then kept and considerd as the ?corrected?",
        "one.",
        "This module handles spelling errors of individual words; it does not handle split/merge errors or word reordering.",
        "The spelling checker sometimes attempts to correct words that were already correct, because the list does not contain named entities or translitera-tions, and it does not contain all possible correct Arabic words.",
        "Because the spelling checker module decreased the overall performance, it is not included in our final system.",
        "3.2 Final System Feature 14 Replacement The first step in our final system is Feature 14 Replace-ment, as described above.",
        "Rule-based Clitic Correction With the resulting data, we apply a set of rules to reattach clitics that may have been split apart from the base word.",
        "After examining the train dataset, we realized that 95% of word merging cases involve ???",
        "attachment.",
        "When found by themselves, the clitics are attached to either the previous word or next word, based on whether they generally appear as prefixes or suffixes.",

        "We use fast align, the aligner included with the cdec decoder (Dyer et al., 2010) as the word aligner with grow-diag as the symmetrization heuristic (Och and Ney, 2003), and build a 5-gram language model from the correct Arabic training data with KenLM (Heafield et al., 2013).",
        "The system is evaluated with BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and then scored for precision, recall, and F1 measure against the dev set reference.",
        "We tested several different reordering window sizes since this is not a standard translation task, so we may want shorter distance reordering.",
        "Although 7 is the default size, we tested 7, 5, 4, 3, and 0, and found that a window of size 4 produces the best result according to BLEU score and F1 measure.",
        "4 Experiments and Results We train and evaluate our system with the training and development datasets provided for the shared task and the m2Scorer (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012b).",
        "These datasets are extracted from the QALB corpus of human-edited Arabic text produced by native speak-ers, non-native speakers and machines (Zaghouani et al., 2014).",
        "We conducted a small scale statistical study on the 950K tokens training set used to build our system.",
        "We realized that 306K tokens are affected by a correction action which could be a word edit, insertion, deletion, split or merge.",
        "169K tokens were edited to correct the spelling errors and 99K tokens were inserted (mostly punctuation marks).",
        "Furthermore, there is a total of 6,7K non necessary tokens deleted and 10.6K attached tokens split and 18.2 tokens merged.",
        "Finally, there are only 427 tokens moved in the sentence and 1563 multiple correction action.",
        "We experiment with different configurations and reach the sweet spot of performance when combining the different modules.",
        "4.1 Results To evaluate the performance of our system on the development data, we compare its output to the reference (gold annotation).",
        "We then compute the usual measures of precision, recall and f-measure.",
        "Results for various system configurations on the dev and test sets are given in Table 1.",
        "Using the baseline system consisting in replacing words by their non diacritized form (Feature 14), we could correct 51.9% of the errors occurring in the dev set, when punctuation is not considered.",
        "This result drops when we consider the punctuation errors which seem to be more complex to correct: Only 32.1% of the errors are corrected in the dev set.",
        "It is important to notice that adding the clitic rules to the Feature 14 baseline yields an improvement of + 5.15 in F-measure.",
        "We reach the best F-measure value when using the phrase-based MT system after pre-processing the data and applying the Feature 14 and clitic rules.",
        "Using this combination we were able to correct 68.5% of the errors (excluding punctuation) on the development set with a precision of 82.2% and 74.38% on the test set.",
        "When we consider the punctuation, 53.89% of the errors of different types were corrected on the dev set and 56.35% on the test set with a precision of 75.71% and 77.97%, respectively.",
        "139 5 Error Analysis and Discussion When building error correction systems, minimizing the number of cases where correct words are marked as incorrect is often regarded as more important than covering a high number of errors.",
        "Therefore, a higher precision is often preferred over higher recall.",
        "In order to understand what was affecting the performance, we took a closer look at our system output and translation tables to present some samples of errors that our system makes on development set.",
        "5.1 Out-of-vocabulary Words This category includes words that are not seen by our system during the training which is a common problem in machine translation systems.",
