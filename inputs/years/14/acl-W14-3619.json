        "Traditional techniques in text correction is the generation of a large set of candidates for an incorrect word using different approaches like enumerating all possible candidates in edit distance of one.",
        "Then, all the candidates are ranked such that the best candidates are ranked on the top of the list.",
        "Finally, the best candidate is chosen to replace incorrect word.",
        "The traditional techniques are slow, since the generation of a large set of candidates is time consuming task.",
        "Also, it doesn't take into consideration the overall score of the system.",
        "While, in this paper we apply a novel technique in automatic error correction, where we take into consideration the correction rules, not the variants.",
        "In the propose technique, we order corrections to be applied on text to maximize the F-score.",
        "This shared task was on automatic Arabic text correction.",
        "For this task, the Qatar Arabic Language Bank (QALB) corpus (Mohit et.",
        "al, 2014) was provided.",
        "The QALB corpus contains a preprocessed input text with some features extracted and the corrected output.",
        "The main issue in the shared task, that the tools used for the extraction of the provided features wasn't provided.",
        "So, we had a choice, to create an algorithm that can deal with missing features, or to generate our own set of features.",
        "Finally, we have chosen to generate our own set of features.",
        "The proposed framework could be described as a probabilistic rule-based framework.",
        "During the training of this framework, we extracted some rules and assign a probability to each rule as shown later in section 3.",
        "The extracted rules are then sorted based on their probabilities.",
        "And during the test, we apply the rules from the highest probability to the lowest probability one by one, on the entire test data till a stopping criteria is satisfied.",
        "During the algorithm we have some kind of heuristic to estimate the F-score after each rule is apply.",
        "The stopping criteria for the algorithm is that the estimated F-score start to decrease.",
        "This paper is organized as follow, in section 2, an overview of the related work in the field of error correction is discussed.",
        "In section 3, the proposed system and its main components are explained.",
        "The evaluation process is presented in section 4.",
        "Finally, concluding remarks and future work are presented in section 5.",
        "2 Related Work Most of the work done in the field automatic error correction for text, is made for English language (Kukich, 1992; Golding and Roth, 1999; Carlson and Fette, 2007; Banko and Brill, 2001).",
        "Arabic spelling correction has also received considerable interest, Ben Othmane Zribi and Ben Ahmed, (2003) have proposed a new aiming to reduce the number of proposals given by automatic Arabic spelling correction tools, which have reduced the proposals by about 75%.",
        "Haddad and Yaseen (2007) took into consideration the complex nature of the Arabic language and the effect of the root-pattern relationship to lo-143 cate, reduce and rank the most probable correction candidates in Arabic derivative words to improve the process of error detection and correction.",
        "Hassan et al. (2008) used a finite state automata to propose candidates corrections, then assign a score to each candidate and choose the best correction in the context.",
        "Shaalan et al. (2010) developed an error correction system to Arabic learners.",
        "Alkanhal et al. (2012) have developed an error correction system and they emphasized on space insertion and deletion.",
        "Zag-houani et al. (2014) provided a large scale dataset for the task of automatic error correction for Arabic text.",
        "3 The Proposed System The main system idea is explained by the al-gorithm, in figure 1.",
        "The algorithm has two in-puts: the set of sentences that need to be modified T[1..n], and the set of correction rules C[1..m] that could be applied to text.",
        "The algorithm has one single output: the set of modified sentences T?[1..n].",
        "The algorithm could be divided into two main component: the initialization and the main loop.",
        "Figure 1: Proposed Algorithm First, the initialization part of the algorithm starts from line 1 to line 8.",
        "In the first line, the sentences are copied from T[1..n] to T?[1..n].",
        "In line number 2, the number of errors in the test set T[1..n] is expected using the rate of errors in the train set (#error / #words).",
        "In lines 3 to 8, the variables used in the algorithm are initialized to zero.",
        "The main loop of the algorithm starts from line 9 to line 20.",
        "In line 9, the loop begins, and the sentences are copied from T[1..n] to T?",
        "[1..n] and the F-score is copied to old F-score, in lina-rae 10 and 11.",
        "Then the first not applied correction with the highest probability to be correct is correct is chosen in line 12.",
        "In line 13, the correction is applied on the text T[1..n].",
        "Then we calculate the number of changes between T[1..n] and T?",
        "[1..n], in line 14.",
        "And based on the expected number of changes, we update the expected number of performed edits in line 14.",
        "Al-so, we update the expected number of the correct edits based on the number of change and the probability of a change to be correct in line 15.",
        "In lines 17 to 19, we calculate the expected pre-cision, recall and F-score based on the expected gold edits, performed edits, and correct edits calculated at lines 2, 14, and 15.",
        "If the F-score is higher than the old F-score, which means that applying the correction c on the text T[1..n] will increase the expected F-score, then go to line 9 and start a new iteration in the loop.",
        "And if the F-score is lower than the old F-score, which means that applying the correction c on the text T[1..n] will decrease the expected F-score, then exit the loop and return the modified text T?[1..n].",
        "After we have discussed the main idea of algo-rithm, in the following subsections we will discuss some of the extracted corrections rules and the calculation of the probability of each rule.",

        "For example, let's consider single character replace spelling error, if the incorrect word length is five characters, so you need to make ((28-1)*5) iterations to generate all possible variants of a word, while in the proposed algorithm you generate one variant at the time, and you might stop after that.",
