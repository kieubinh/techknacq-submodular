        "Supervised machine learning methods for automatic subjectivity and sentiment analysis (SSA) are problematic when applied to social media, such as Twitter, since they do not generalise well to unseen topics.",
        "A possible remedy of this problem is to apply distant supervision (DS) approaches, which learn from large amounts of automatically annotated data.",
        "This research empirically evaluates the performance of DS approaches for SSA on Arabic Twitter feeds.",
        "Results for emoticon- and lexicon-based DS show a significant performance gain over a fully supervised baseline, especially for detecting subjectivity, where we achieve 95.19% accuracy, which is a 48.47% absolute improvement over previous fully supervised results."

        "Subjectivity and sentiment analysis (SSA) aims to determine the attitude of an author with respect to some topic, e.g. objective or subjective, or the overall contextual polarity of an utterance, e.g. positive or negative.",
        "Previous work on automatic SSA has used manually annotated gold standard data sets to analyse which feature sets and models perform best for this task, e.g. (Wilson et al., 2009; Wiebe et al., 1999).",
        "Most of this work is in English, but there have been first attempts to apply similar techniques to Arabic, e.g. (Abdul-Mageed et al., 2011; Mourad and Darwish, 2013).",
        "While these models work well when tested using cross-validation on limited static data sets, our previous results reveal that these models do not generalise to new data sets, e.g. collected at a later point in time, due to their limited coverage (Refaee and Rieser, 2014).",
        "While there is a growing interest within the NLP community in building Arabic corpora by harvesting the web, e.g. (Al-Sabbagh and Girju, 2012; Abdul-Mageed and Diab, 2012; Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2013), these resources have not been publicly released yet and only small amounts of these data-sets are (manually) annotated.",
        "We therefore turn to an approach known as distant supervision (DS), as first proposed by (Read, 2005), which uses readily available fea-tures, such as emoticons, as noisy labels in order to efficiently annotate large amounts of data for learning domain-independent models.",
        "This approach has been shown to be successful for English SSA, e.g. (Go et al., 2009), and SSA for under-resourced languages, such as Chinese (Yuan and Purver, 2012).",
        "The contributions of this paper are as follows: we first collect two large corpora using emoticons and lexicon-based features as noisy labels, which we plan to release as part of this submission.",
        "Sec-ond, this work is the first to apply and empirically evaluate DS approaches on Arabic Twitter feeds.",
        "We find that DS significantly outperforms fully supervised SSA on our held-out test set.",
        "However, compared to a majority baseline, predicting negative sentiment proves to be difficult using DS approaches.",
        "Third, we conduct an error analysis to critically evaluate the results and give recommendations for future directions.",
        "2 Arabic Twitter SSA Corpora We start by collecting three corpora at different times over one year to account for the cyclic effects of topic change in social media (Eisenstein, 2013).",
        "Table 1 shows the distributions of labels in our data-sets: 1.",
        "A gold standard data-set which we use for training and evaluation (spring 2013); 2.",
        "A data-set for DS using emoticon-based queries (autumn 2013); 3.",

        "Gold Standard Data-set: We harvest two gold standard data sets at different time steps, which we label manually.",
        "We first harvest a data set of 3,031 multi-dialectal Arabic tweets randomly retrieved over the period from February to March 2013.",
        "We use this set as a training set for our fully supervised approach.",
        "We also manually label 1,580 tweets collected in autumn 2013, which we use as an independent held-out test set.",
        "Two native speakers were recruited to manually annotate the collected data for subjectivity and sentiment, where we define sentiment as a positive or negative emotion, opinion or attitude, following (Wil- son et al., 2009).",
        "Our gold standard annotations reached a weighted ?",
        "= 0.76, which indicates reliable annotations (Carletta, 1996).",
        "We also automatically annotate the corpus with a rich set of linguistically motivated features using freely available processing tools for Arabic, such as MADA (Nizar Habash and Roth, 2009), see Table 2.",
        "For more details on gold standard corpus annotation please see (Refaee and Rieser, 2014).",
        "1 Type Feature-sets Morphological diacritic, aspect, gender, mood, per-son, part of speech (POS), state, voice, has morphological analysis.",
        "Syntactic n-grams of words and POS, lem-mas, including bag of words (BOW), bag of lemmas.",
        "Semantic has positive lexicon, has negative lexicon, has neutral lexicon, has negator, has positive emoticon, has negative emoticon.",
        "Table 2: Annotated Feature-sets Emoticon-Based Queries: In order to investigate DS approaches to SSA, we also collect a much larger data set of Arabic tweets, where we use emoticons as noisy labels, following e.g. (Read, 2005; Go et al., 2009; Pak and Paroubek, 2010; Yuan and Purver, 2012; Suttles and Ide, 2013).",
        "We query Twitter API for tweets with variations of positive and negative emoticons to obtain pairs of micro-blog texts (statuses) and using Emoticon Sentiment label :) , :-) , :)), (: , (-: , ((: positive :( , :-( , :(( , :(( , ): , )): )-: negative Table 3: Emoticons used to automatically label the training data-set.",
        "emoticons as author-provided emotion labels.",
        "In following (Purver and Battersby, 2012; Zhang et al., 2011; Suttles and Ide, 2013), we also utilise some sentiment-bearing hash tags to query emotional tweets, e.g. hQ ?",
        "happiness and ?",
        "Q k sadness.",
        "Note that emoticons and hash-tags are merely used to collect and build the training set and were replaced by the standard (positive/ neg-ative) labels.",
        "In order to collect neutral instances, we query a set of official news accounts, following an approach by (Pak and Paroubek, 2010).",
        "Examples of the accounts queried are: BBC-Arabic, Al-Jazeera Arabic, SkyNews Arabia, Reuters Arabic, France24-Arabic, and DW Arabic.",
        "We then automatically extract the same set of linguistically motivated features as for the gold standard corpus.",
        "Lexicon-Based Annotation: We also investigate an alternative approach to DS, which combines rule-driven lexicon-based SSA, e.g. (Taboada et al., 2011), with machine learning ap-proaches, following (Zhang et al., 2011).",
        "We build a new training dataset by combining three lexica.",
        "We first exploit two existing subjectivity lexica: a manually annotated Arabic subjectivity lexicon (Abdul-Mageed and Diab, 2012) and a publicly available English subjectivity lexicon, MPQA (Wilson et al., 2009), which we automatically translate using Google Translate, following a 1 This GS data-set has been shared via a special LREC repository available at http://www.resourcebook.eu/shareyourlr/index.php 175 similar technique to (Mourad and Darwish, 2013).",
        "The translated lexicon is manually corrected by removing translations with neutral or no clear sentiment indicator.",
        "2 This results in 2,627 translated instances after correction.",
        "We then construct a third dialectal lexicon of 484 words that we extracted from an independent Twitter development set and manually annotated for sentiment.",
        "All lexicons were merged into a combined lexicon of 4,422 annotated sentiment words (duplicates removed).",
        "In order to obtain automatic labels for positive and negative instances, we follow a simplified version of the rule-based aggregation approach of Taboada et al. (2011).",
        "First, all lexicons and tweets are lem-matised.",
        "For each tweet, matched sentiment words are marked with either (+1) or (-1) to incorporate the semantic orientation of individual constituents.",
        "This achieves a coverage level of 76.62% (which is computed as a percentage of tweets with at least one lexicon word) using the combined lexicon.",
        "The identified sentiment words are replaced by place-holders to avoid bias.",
        "To account for nega-tion, we reverse the polarity (switch negation) following (Taboada et al., 2011).",
        "The sentiment orientation of the entire tweet is then computed by summing up the sentiment scores of all sentiment words in a given tweet into a single score that automatically determines the label as being: positive or negative.",
        "Instances where the score equals zero are excluded from the training set as they represent mixed-sentiment instances with an even number of sentiment words.",
        "We validate this lexicon-based labelling approach against a separate development set by comparing the automatically computed labels against manually annotated ones, reaching an accuracy of 69.06%.",
        "3 Classification Experiments Using Distant Supervision We experiment with a number of machine learning methods and we report the results of the best performing scheme, namely Support Vector Machines (SVMs), where we use the implementation provided by WEKA (Witten and Frank, 2005).",
        "We report the results on two metrics: F-score and accuracy.",
        "We use paired t-tests to establish significant differences (p < .05).",

        "tic).",
        "We compare our results against a majority baseline and against a fully supervised approach.",
        "It is important to mention the most prominent previous work on SSA of Arabic tweets like (Abdul- Mageed et al., 2012) who trained SVM classifiers on a nearly 3K manually labelled data-set to curry out two-stage binary classification attaining accuracy up to 65.87% for the sentiment classification task.",
        "In a later work, (Mourad and Darwish, 2013) employ SVM and Naive Bayes classifiers trained on a set of 2,300 manually labelled Arabic tweets.",
        "With 10-fold cross-validation settings, the author reported an accuracy score of 72.5% for the sentiment classification task (positive vs. negative).",
        "We evaluate the approaches on a separate held-out test-set that is collected at a later point in time, as described in Section 2.",
        "3.1 Emoticon-Based Distant Supervision We first evaluate the potential of exploiting training data that is automatically labelled using emoti-cons.",
        "The results are summarised in Table 4.",
        "Polar vs. neutral: The results show a significant improvement over the majority baseline, as well as over the classifier trained on the gold standard data set: We achieve 95.19% accuracy on the held-out set, which is a 48.47% absolute improvement over our previous fully supervised results.",
        "We attribute this improvement to two factors.",
        "First, the emoticon-based data set is about 60 times bigger than the gold standard data set (see Table 1) and thus the emoticon-based model better generalises to unseen events.",
        "Note that this performance is comparable with (Suttles and Ide, 2013) who achieved up to 98% accuracy using emoticon-based DS on English tweets using 5.9 million tweets.",
        "Second, neutral instances were sampled from news accounts, which are mainly written in modern standard Arabic (MSA), whereas we assume that tweets including emoticons (which we use for acquiring polar instances) are mainly written in dialectal Arabic (DA).",
        "In future work, we plan to investigate this hypothesis further by automatically detecting MSA/DA for a given tweet, e.g. (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2013).",
        "Abdul-Mageed et al. (2012) show that having such a feature can result in no significant impact on the overall performance of both subjectivity and sentiment analysis tasks.",

        "Use of sarcasm and irony: Using an emoticon as a label is naturally noisy, since we cannot know for sure the intended meaning the author wishes to express.",
        "This is especially problematic when emoticons are used in a sarcastic way, i.e. their intended meaning is the opposite of the expressed emotion.",

        "In order to investigate this hypothesis we manually labelled a random sample of 303 misclassified instances for neutral, positive, nega-tive, as well as sarcastic, mixed and unclear sen-timents, see Table 6.",
        "Interestingly, the sarcastic instances represent only 4.29%, while tweets with mixed (positive and negative) sentiments represent 5.94% of the manually annotated sub-set.",
        "In 34.32% of the instances, the manual labels have matched the automatic emoticon-based labels.",

        "We experiment with two different settings for the lexicon-based DS approach.",
        "First, we experiment with a lexicon-presence approach that automatically labels a tweet as a positive instance if it only includes positive lexicon(s) and the same for the negative class.",
        "Data instances having mixed positive and negative lexicons or no sentiment lexicons are excluded from the training set.",
        "The second approach is based on assigning a numerical value to sentiment words and aggregating the value into a single score, see Section 2.",
        "The results are summarised in Table 4.",
        "Polar vs. neutral: We can observe that the models trained with the lexicon-presence approach significantly outperform the majority baseline, the fully supervised learning, as well as the lexicon-aggregation approach.",
        "The lexicon-presence and the emoticon-based DS approaches reach almost identical performance on our test set.",
        "Positive vs. negative: Again, we observe that it is difficult to discriminate negative instances for both lexicon-based approaches.",
        "The lexicon-presence approach significantly outperforms the majority baseline, the fully supervised learn-ing, and the lexicon-aggregation approach.",
        "But this time it also significantly outperforms the emoticon-based approach, which allows us to conclude that lexicon-based labelling introduces less noise for sentiment analysis.",
        "However, our results are significantly worse than the lexicon-based approach of Taboada et al. (2011), with up to 80% accuracy, and the learning-based approach of Zhanh et al. (2011), with up to 85% accuracy on English tweets.",
        "The lexicon-presence approach achieves the highest precision for negative tweets, see table 5, but still has a low recall.",
        "The lexicon-aggregation approach has the highest recall for negative tweets, but its precision is almost identical to the emoticon-based approach.",
        "3.2.1 Error Analysis for Lexicon-Based DS We conduct an error analysis in order to further investigate the difference in performance between the lexicon-presence and the lexicon-aggregation approach.",
        "We hypothesise that the lexicon-aggregation might perform better on instances with mixed emotions, i.e. tweets with positive and negative indicators, but a clear overall sentiment.",
        "We therefore manually add 36 instances to the test set which contain mixed emotions (but a unique sentiment label).",
        "However, the results on the new test set confirm the superiority of the lexicon-presence approach.",
        "In general, both lexicon-based approaches perform worse for sentiment classification.",
        "Taboada et al. (2011) highlight the issue of ?positive bias?",
        "associated with lexicon-based approaches of sentiment analysis, as people tend to prefer using positive expressions and understate negative ones.",
        "4 Conclusion and Future Work We address the task of subjectivity and sentiment analysis (SSA) for Arabic Twitter feeds.",
        "We empirically investigate the performance of distant supervision (DS) approaches on a manually labelled independent test set, in comparison to a fully supervised baseline, trained on a manually labelled gold standard data set.",
        "Our experiments reveal: (1) DS approaches to SSA for Arabic Twitter feeds show significantly higher performance in accuracy and F-score than a fully supervised approach.",
        "Despite providing noisy labels, they allow larger amounts of data to be rapidly annotated, and thus, can account for the topic shifts observed in social media.",
        "(2) DS approaches which use a subjectivity lexicon for labelling outperform approaches using emoticon-based labels for sentiment analysis, but achieve a very similar performance for subjectivity detection.",
        "We hypothesise that this can be attributed to unclear facings of the emoticons.",
        "(3) We also find that both our DS approaches achieve good results of up to 95% accuracy for subjectivity analysis, which is comparable to previous work on English tweets.",
        "However, we detect a decrease in performance for sentiment analysis, where negative instances repeatedly get misclassified as positive.",
        "We assume that this can be attributed to the more indirect ways adopted by people to express their emotions verbally via social media (Taboada et al., 2011).",
        "Other possible reasons for this, which we will explore in future work, include culturally specific differences (Hong et al., 2011), as well as pragmatic/ context-dependent aspects of opinion (Sayeed, 2013).",
