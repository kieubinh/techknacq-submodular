        "The Arabic language has many varieties, where the Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) coexists with various dialects.",
        "Dialects differ from MSA and from each other lexically, phonologically, morphologically and syntactically.",
        "MSA has standard orthography and is used in formal contexts (e.g., publications, newspaper articles, etc.",
        "), while the dialects are usually limited to daily verbal interactions.",
        "However, with the recent rise of social media, it has become increasingly common to use dialects in written communication as well, which has constituted the research in dialectal Arabic (DA) as a separate field within the broader field of natural language processing (NLP).",
        "As DA NLP is still in its infancy, there is lack of basic computational resources and tools, which are needed in order to apply standard NLP approaches to the dialects of Arabic.",
        "For instance, statistical approaches need a lot of training data, which makes it very hard, if not impossible, to apply them to resource-poor languages; this is especially true for statistical machine translation (SMT) of Arabic dialects.",
        "The Arabic language and its dialects are highly inflectional, and a word can appear in many more inflected forms compared to English.",
        "Consider the Arabic words \u0010 IJ .",

        "??",
        "?playing?",
        "/lEb/.",
        "Each morphological variation is derived from a root word with different affixes addressing different functions.",
        "This causes data sparseness, and covering all possible word forms of a root word may not be always possible.",
        "Considering the different variants of Arabic, the problem is exacer-abated as dialects could use different choices of affixes for the same function.",
        "For example, the MSA word ?",
        "?J .",
        "?",
        "?K /yalEabuwn/, meaning ?they are play-ing?, could be found as ?",
        "?J .",

        "/biylEabwA/ in Egyptian Arabic.",
        "One possible solution is to use a morphological segmenter that segments words into simpler units such as stems and affixes, which might be covered in the training set (Zollmann et al., 2006; Tsai et al., 2010).",
        "When applied to dialects, this may reduce the lexical gap between dialects and MSA by matching the common stems.",
        "Unfortunately, there are no standard morphological segmentation tools for dialects.",
        "Due to the difference in morphology, tools designed for MSA do not work well for dialects.",
        "Developing rule-based segmenters for each dialect might appear to be the ideal solution, but, as the orthography of dialects is not standardized, crafting linguistic rules for them is very hard.",
        "In this paper, we focus on training an unsupervised model for word segmentation, which we apply to SMT for a given Arabic dialect.",
        "We train a pre-existing unsupervised segmentation model on the Arabic side of the training bi-text (and on some other monolingual data), and then we optimize its parameters based on the resulting SMT quality.",
        "Similarly, a multi-dialectal word segmenter could be developed by training on multi-dialectal data.",
        "207 In particular, we develop a Qatari Arabic to English (QA-EN) SMT system, which we train on a small pre-existing bi-text.",
        "As part of the development of the unsupervised segmentation model, we also collected some additional monolingual data for Qatari Arabic.",
        "Qatari Arabic is a subdi-alect of the more general Gulf dialect, among with Saudi, Kuwaiti, Emirati, Bahraini, and Omani; we collected additional monologual data for each of these subdialects, and we release this data to the research community.",
        "We train an unsupervised segmentation tool, Morphessor, and its MAP model (Creutz and La-gus, 2007), using different variations of the collected Qatari data.",
        "We optimize the single hyperparameter of the MAP model by maximizing the translation quality of the QA-EN SMT system in terms of BLEU.",
        "Our experimental results demonstrate that the resulting unsupervised segmenter yields improvements in translation quality when compared to (i) using no segmentation and (ii) using an MSA-based ATB segmenter.",
        "We further develop a multi-dialectal word segmentation model, which we train on the Arabic side of the multi-dialectal training data, which consists of Qatari Arabic, Egyptian Arabic (EGY), Levantine Arabic (LEV) and MSA to English, i.e., a scaled combination of all the available parallel data.",
        "We train a QA-EN SMT system using the segmented multi-dialectal data, and we show an absolute gain of 1.5 BLEU points compared to a baseline that uses no segmentation.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: First, we provide an overview of related work on Dialectal Arabic NLP (Section 2).",
        "Next, we discuss and we illustrate the linguistic differences between different Arabic dialects in comparison with and with a focus on Qatari Arabic (Section 3).",
        "Then, we provide statistics about the corpora we collected and used in our experiments, followed by an illustration of the orthographic normalization schemes we applied (Section 4).",
        "We next provide a high-level description of our approach, which uses morphological segmentation to combine resources for other Arabic dialects in a QA-EN SMT system effectively (Section 4.3).",
        "We also explain our experimental setup and we present the results (Section 5).",
        "We then discuss translating in the reverse direction, i.e., into Qatari Arabic (Section 6).",
        "Finally, we point to possible directions for future work and we conclude the paper (Section 7).",
        "2 Related Work NLP for DA is still in its early stages of development and many challenges need to be overcomed such as the lack of suitable tools and resources.",
        "Collecting resources for dialectal Arabic: Several researchers have directed efforts to develop DA computational resources (Maamouri et al., 2006; Al-Sabbagh and Girju, 2010; Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2011; Salama et al., 2014).",
        "Zbib et al. (2012) built two dialectal Arabic-English parallel corpora for Egyptian and Levantine Arabic using crowdsourcing.",

        "Mubarak and Darwish (2014) collected a multi-dialectal corpus using Twitter.",
        "Unlike previous work, we focus on Gulf subdialects, particularly Qatari Arabic.",
        "The monolingual data that we collected is a high-quality dialectal resource and originates from dialect-specific sources such as novels and forums.",
        "Adapting SMT resources for other Arabic di-alects: Many researchers have explored the potential of using MSA as a pivot language for improving SMT of Arabic dialects (Bakr et al., 2008; Sawaf, 2010; Salloum and Habash, 2011; Sajjad et al., 2013a; Jeblee et al., 2014).",
        "This often involves DA-MSA conversion schemes as an alternative in the absence of DA-MSA parallel resources.",
        "In contrast, limited work has been done on lever-aging available resources for other dialects.",
        "Re-cently, Zbib et al. (2012) have shown that using a small amount of dialectal data could yield great improvements for SMT.",
        "Here, we investigate the potential of improving the resource adaptability of Arabic dialects.",
        "Our work is different as we use an unsupervised segmenter that helps in improving the lexical overlap between dialects and MSA.",
        "Building morphological segmenters for the Arabic dialects: Researchers have already focused efforts on crafting and extending existing MSA tools to DA by mainly using a set of rules (Habash et al., 2012).",
        "Habash and Rambow (2006) presented MAGEAD, a knowledge-based morphological analyzer and generator for Egyptian and Levantine Arabic.",
        "Chiang et al. (2006) developed a Levantine morphological analyzer on top of an existing MSA analyzer using an explicit knowledge base.",
        "208 Riesa and Yarowsky (2006) trained a supervised trie-based model using a small lexicon of dialectal affixes.",
        "In our work, we eliminate the need for linguistic knowledge by training an unsupervised model using available resources.",

        "We chose Morfessor because of its superior performance on Arabic compared to other unsupervised models (Siivola et al., 2007; Poon et al., 2009).",
        "The model has a single hyperparameter, the perplexity threshold parameter B, which controls the granularity of segmentation.",
        "The recommended value ranges from 1 to 400 where 1 means maximum fine-grained segmentation, and 400 restricts it to the least segmented output.",
        "We set the threshold empirically to 70, as shown in Section 5.1.",
        "5 Experimental Setup We performed an extrinsic evaluation of the variations in segmentation by building a Qatari Arabic to English machine translation system on each of them.",
        "We also tested Morfessor on other available dialects and on MSA, and we will show below how a uniform segmentation can help to better adapt resources for dialects and MSA for SMT.",
        "This section describes our experimental setup.",
        "Datasets: We divided the QCA corpus into 1k sentences each for development and testing, and we used the remaining 12k for training.",
        "We adapted parallel corpora for Egyptian, Levantine and MSA to English to be used for Qatari Arabic to English SMT.",
        "For MSA, we used parallel corpora of TED talks (Cettolo et al., 2012) and the AMARA corpus (Abdelali et al., 2014), which consists of educational videos.",
        "Since the QCA corpus is in the speech domain, we believe that an MSA corpus of spoken domain would be more helpful than a text domain such as News.",
        "For Egyptian and Levantine, we used the parallel corpus provided by Zbib et al. (2012).",
        "There is no Gulf?English parallel data available in the literature.",
        "The data that we found was a very small collection of subdialects of Gulf Arabic; we did not use it for MT experiments.",
        "However, we used the Qatari part of the AVIA corpus to train Morfessor.",
        "Machine translation system settings: We used a phrase-based statistical machine translation model as implemented in the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007) for machine translation.",
        "6 This is an extension of the basic Morfessor method and is based on a Maximum a Posteriori model.",
        "211 We built separate directed word alignments for source-to-target and target-to-source using IBM model 4 (Brown et al., 1993), and we symmetrized them using the grow-diag-final-and heuristics (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "We then extracted phrase pairs with a maximum length of seven, and we scored them using maximum likelihood estimation with Kneser-Ney smoothing (Kneser and Ney, 1995).",
        "We also built a lexicalized reordering model, msd-bidirectional-fe.",
        "We built a 5-gram language model on the English side of QCA-train using KenLM (Heafield, 2011).",
        "Finally, we built a log-linear model using the above features.",
        "We tuned the model weights by optimizing BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) on the tuning set, using PRO (Hopkins and May, 2011) with sentence-level BLEU+1 optimization (Nakov et al., 2012).",
        "In testing, we used minimum Bayes risk decoding (Kumar and Byrne, 2004), cube pruning, and the operation sequence model (Durrani et al., 2011).",
        "Baseline: Our baseline Qatari Arabic to English MT system is trained on the QCA bitext without any segmentation of Qatari Arabic.",
        "For the experiments described in this paper, we used the English side of the QCA corpus for language modeling.",
        "5.1 Experimental Results In this section, we first present our work on using Morfessor for segmenting Qatari Arabic.",
        "We tried different values of its parameter, and we trained it using corpora of different sizes to find balanced settings that improve SMT quality as compared with no segmentation and with segmentation using the Stanford ATB segmenter.",
        "We further applied our selected settings to segment MSA, EGY and LEV and used them for Qatari Arabic to English machine translation.",
        "Our results show that a uniform segmentation scheme across different dialects improves machine translation.",
        "Morfessor training variations: We trained Morfessor using three corpora: (i) QCA, (ii) AVIA QA plus Qatari Novels, and (iii) a combination thereof.",
        "Table 3 shows the results for our SMT system when trained on the QCA parallel corpus, which was segmented using different training models of Morfessor with B = 40.",
        "The result for segmented Qatari Arabic is always better than the baseline, irrespective of the training model used for segmentation.",
        "We can see that the Morfessor model trained on a large monolingual corpus, i.e., on (ii) or (iii), yields better results.",

        "?After merging?",
        "are the results using the post-processed Qatari segmented data.",
        "The high reduction in OOV in Table 3 is because of the fine-grained segmentation.",
        "We tried different values for the perplexity parameter B in order to find a good balance between better BLEU scores and linguistically correct segmentations.",
        "The first part of Table 4 shows the effect of different values of B on the quality of the machine translation system trained on AVIA QA , Qatari Novels.",
        "We achieved the best SMT score at B = 70.",
        "We further analyzed the output of Morfessor at B = 70 and we noticed that it tends to generate very small segments of length two and three characters long.",
        "The segmentation produces more than one stem in a word and does not generate legal word units.",
        "For example, the word \u0010 ?",
        "?A J??@?",
        " -- and the industry?",
        "/wAlSinAEp/ is segmented as PRE/?",
        "+ PRE/?",
        "@ + STM/?",
        "+ PRE/ ?",
        "+ PRE/ @ + STM/?",
        "+ SUF/ \u0010 ?.",
        "We apply a post-processing step that merges all stems in a word and affixes between them to one stem.",
        "So, a word can have only one stem.",
        "For example, the word \u0010 ?",
        "?A J??@?",
        "would be segmented as PRE/?@?",
        "+ STM/?A J?",
        "+ SUF/ \u0010 ?.",
        "This yielded linguistically correct segmentations in many cases.",
        "The second part of Table 4 shows the effect of the post-processing on the BLEU score.",
        "We can see that it remains almost the same with an increase in OOV rate.",
        "212 For rest of the experiments in this paper, we used a value of 70 for the perplexity threshold parameter plus the post-processing on segmentation.",
        "We trained Morfessor on the concatenation of QCA, AVIA Q A and Novels.",
        "7 Using other Arabic variations: In this section, we present experiments using MSA, EGY and LEV to English bitexts combined with the QCA bitext for Qatari Arabic to English machine translation.",
        "We explored three segmentation options for the Arabic side of the data: (i) no segmentation, (ii) ATB segmentation, and (iii) unsupervised segmentation using Morfessor.",
        "The QCA corpus is of much smaller size compared to other Arabic variants, say MSA.",
        "It is possible that in the training of the machine translation models, the large corpus dominates the QCA corpus.",
        "In order to avoid that, we balanced the two corpora by replicating the smaller corpus X number of times in order to make it approximately equal to the large corpus (Nakov and Ng, 2009).",
        "8 The complete procedure is described below.",
        "In a nutshell, for building a machine translation system using the MSA plus Qatari corpus, we first balanced the Qatari corpus to make it approximately equal to MSA and concatenated them.",
        "For training Morfessor, the Qatari Arabic data consisted of QCA, Novels and AVIA QA , while for SMT, it consisted of QCA only.",
        "In both cases, we balanced it to be approximately equal to MSA.",
        "We then trained Morfessor on the balanced (QCA, Novels, AVIA QA ) plus MSA data and we segmented the Arabic side of the balanced QCA plus MSA training data for machine translation.",
        "We built a machine translation system on the segmented data.",
        "We segmented the testing and tuning data sets similarly.",
        "We used the same balancing when we combined EGY-EN and LEV-EN with the Qatari Arabic ?",
        "English data.",
        "We also tried training multiple unsupervised models, but this yielded lower SMT quality compared to using a single model trained on multi-dialects.",
        "Using different models could result in having different segmentation schemes, which might not help in reducing the vocabulary mismatch between different variants of Arabic.",
        "7 We did not see a big difference in training Morfessor with and without the QCA corpus, and we decided to use the complete data for training.",
        "8 Due to the spoken nature of the QCA corpus, it contains shorter sentences.",
        "Thus, we balanced the corpora based on the number of tokens rather than on the number of sentences.",
        "Train NONE ATB Morfessor QCA 12.2 12.9 13.7 ?QCA,MSA 12.7 13.3 14.6 ?QCA,EGY 13.0 13.5 14.5 ?QCA,LEV 13.8 13.7 15.2 Table 5: BLEU scores for Qatari Arabic to English SMT using three different segmentation settings.",
        "?QCA means the modified QCA corpus with number of tokens approximately equal to MSA, EGY and LEV in the respective experiments.",
        "Table 5 shows the results.",
        "There are two things to point here.",
        "First, the SMT systems that used the unsupervised morphological segmenter, Mor-fessor, outperformed the systems that used no segmentation and those using the ATB segmentation.",
        "The Morfessor-based systems showed consistent improvements compared to the ATB-based systems over the no-segmentation systems.",
        "This validates our point that unsupervised morphological segmentation generalizes well for a variety of dialects and these SMT results complement that.",
        "The second observation is that adding a bitext for other dialects and MSA improves machine translation quality for Qatari?English SMT.",
        "6 Translation into Qatari Arabic Our monolingual corpora of Gulf subdialects could be also helpful when translating English into Qatari Arabic.",
        "We conducted a few basic experiments in this direction but without segmentation.",
        "We trained an English to Qatari Arabic SMT system on the QCA bitext, using the same settings as described in Section 5.",
        "We then normalized the output of the translation system using the QCRI-Normalizer (Sajjad et al., 2013b).",
        "9 As a language model, we used the Arabic side of the QCA cor-pus, novels and forum data, standalone and together.",
        "Table 6 presents the results of the effect of varying the language model on the quality of the SMT system.",
        "The best system shows an improvement of 0.22 BLEU points absolute compared to the baseline system that only uses the Arabic side of the QCA corpus for LM training.",
        "The SMT system achieved the largest gain when adding QA forum data to the QCA data.",
        "SA and AE monolingual data also showed good improvements.",
        "This might be due to their relatively large sizes; we need further investigation.",

        "In all cases, the translation model is trained on the QCA bitext only.",
        "Note the quite low BLEU scores, especially compared to the reverse translation direction.",
        "One reason is the morphologically rich nature of Qatari Arabic, which makes translating into it a hard problem.",
        "The small amount of training data further adds to it.",
        "We expect to see larger gains compared to Qatari Arabic to English machine translation when segmentation is used.",

        "We further adapted MSA, EGY and LEV in the simplest machine translation settings and we showed a consistent improvement of 1.5 BLEU points when compared to the respective baseline system that uses no segmentation.",
        "In the future, we would like to explore the impact of segmentation on both the translation model and the language model when translating into Qatari Arabic.",
        "This involves greater chal-lenges, as a desegmenter is required for the translation output with every segmentation scheme.",
