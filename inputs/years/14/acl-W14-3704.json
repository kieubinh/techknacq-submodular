        "With the advertising based revenues becoming the main source of revenue, finding novel ways to increase focussed user engagement has become an important research topic.",
        "A typical problem faced by web publishing houses like Yahoo!, is understanding the nature of the comments posted by readers of 10 5 articles posted at any moment on its website.",
        "A lot of users engage in discussions in the comments section of the articles.",
        "Each user has a different perspective and thus comments in that genre this many a times, results in a situation where the discussions in the comment section wander far away from the articles topic.",
        "In order to assist users to discuss relevant points in the comments section, a possible methodology can be to generate questions from the article's content that seek user's opinions about various opinions conveyed in the article (Rokhlenko and Szpektor, 2013).",
        "It would also direct the users into thinking about a spectrum of various points that the article covers and encourage users to share their unique, personal, daily-life experience in events relevant to the article.",
        "This would thus provide a broader view point for readers as well as perspective questions can be created thus catering to users with rich user generated content, this in turn can increase user engagement on the article pages.",
        "Generating such questions manually for huge volume of articles is very difficult.",
        "However, if one could identify the main opinionated sentences within the article, it will be much easier for an editor to generate certain questions around these.",
        "Otherwise, the sentences themselves may also serve as the points for discussion by the users.",
        "Hence, in this paper we discuss a two-stage algorithm which picks opinionated sentences from the articles.",
        "The algorithm assumes an underlying structure for an article, that is, each opinionated sentence is supported by a few factual statements that justify the opinion.",
        "We use the HITS schema to exploit this underlying structure and pick opinionated sentences from the article.",
        "The main contribtutions of this papers are as follows.",
        "First, we present a novel two-stage framework for extracting opinionated sentences from a news article.",
        "Secondly, we propose a new evaluation metric that takes into account the fact that since the amount of polarity (and thus, the number of opinionated sentences) within documents can vary a lot and thus, we should stress on the ratio of opinionated sentences in the top sentences, relative to the ratio of opinionated sentences in the article.",
        "Finally, discussions on how the proposed algorithm captures the underlying structure of the opinions and surrounding facts in a news article reveal that the algorithm does much more than just extracting opinionated sentences.",
        "This paper has been organised as follows.",
        "Section 2 discusses related work in this field.",
        "In section 3, we discuss our two-stage model in further details.",
        "Section 4 discusses the experimental framework and the results.",
        "Further discussions on the underlying assumption behind using HITS along with error analysis are carried out in Section 5.",
        "Conclusions and future work are detailed in Section 6.",
        "2 Related Work Opinion mining has drawn a lot of attention in recent years.",
        "Research works have focused on mining 25 opinions from various information sources such as blogs (Conrad and Schilder, 2007; Harb et al., 2008), product reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004; Qadir, 2009; Dave et al., 2003), news articles (Kim and Hovy, 2006; Hu and Liu, 2006) etc.",
        "Various aspects in opinion mining have been explored over the years (Ku et al., 2006).",
        "One important dimension is to identify the opinion holders as well as opinion targets.",
        "(Lu, 2010) used dependency parser to identify the opinion holders and targets in Chinese news text.",
        "(Choi et al., 2005) use Conditional Random Fields to identify the sources of opinions from the sentences.",
        "(Kobayashi et al., 2005) propose a learning based anaphora resolution technique to extract the opinion tuple < Subject, Attribute, V alue >.",
        "Opinion summarization has been another important aspect (Kim et al., 2013).",
        "A lot of research work has been done for opinion mining from product reviews where most of the text is opinion-rich.",
        "Opinion mining from news articles, however, poses its own challenges because in contrast with the product reviews, not all parts of news articles present opinions (Balahur et al., 2013) and thus finding opinionated sentences itself remains a major obstacle.",
        "Our work mainly focus on classifying a sentence in a news article as opinionated or factual.",
        "There have been works on sentiment classification (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005) but the task of finding opinionated sentences is different from finding sentiments, because sentiments mainly convey the emotions and not the opinions.",
        "There has been research on finding opinionated sentences from various information sources.",
        "Some of these works utilize a dictionary-based (Fei et al., 2012) or regular pattern based (Brun, 2012) approach to identify aspects in the sentences.",
        "(Kim and Hovy, 2006) utilize the presence of a single strong valence wors as well as the total valence score of all words in a sentence to identify opinion-bearing sentences.",
        "(Zhai et al., 2011) work on finding ?evaluative?",
        "sentences in online discussions.",
        "They exploit the inter-relationship of aspects, evaluation words and emotion words to reinforce each other.",
        "Thus, while ours is not the first attempt at opinion extraction from news articles, to the best of our knowledge, none of the previous works has exploited the global structure of a news article to classify a sentence as opinionated/factual.",
        "Though summarization algorithms (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Goyal et al., 2013) utilize the similarity between sentences in an article to find the important sentences, our formulation is different in that we conceptualize two different kinds of nodes in a document, as opposed to the summarization algorithms, which treat all the sentences equally.",
        "In the next section, we describe the propsoed two-stage algorithm in detail.",
        "3 Our Approach Figure 1 gives a flowchart of the proposed two-stage method for extracting opinionated sentences from news articles.",
        "First, each news article is pre-processed to get the dependency parse as well as the TF-IDF vector corresponding to each of the sentences present in the article.",
        "Then, various features are extracted from these sentences which are used as input to the Na?",
        "?ve Bayes classifier, as will be described in Section 3.1.",
        "The Na?",
        "?ve Bayes classifier, which corresponds to the first-stage of our method, assigns a probability score to each sentence as being an opinionated sentence.",
        "In the second stage, the entire article is viewed as a complete and directed graph with edges from every sentence to all other sentences, each edge having a weight suitably computed.",
        "Iterative HITS algorithm is applied to the sentence graph, with opinionated sentences conceptualized as hubs and factual sentences conceptualized as authorities.",

        "?ve Bayes classifier assigns the probability for each sentence being opinionated.",
        "The classifier is trained on 70 News articles from politics domain, sentences of which were marked by a group of annotators as being opinionated or factual.",
        "Each sentence was marked by two annotators.",
        "The inter-annotator agreement using Cohen's kappa coefficient was found to be 0.71.",
        "The features utilized for the classifier are detailed in Table 1.",
        "These features were adapted from those reported in (Qadir, 2009; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003).",
        "A list of positive and negative polar words, further expanded using wordnet synsets was taken from (Kim and Hovy, 2005).",
        "Stanford dependency parser (De Marneffe et al., 2006) was utilized to compute the dependencies for each sentence within the news article.",
        "After the features are extracted from the sentences, we used the Weka implementation of Na?",
        "?ve Bayes to train the classifier 1 .",

        "Presence of aComp, xComp and advMod dependencies in the sentence 3.2 HITS The Na?",
        "?ve Bayes classifier as discussed in Section 3.1 utilizes only the local features within a sentence.",
        "Thus, the probability that a sentence is opinionated remains 1 http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ 26 Figure 1: Flow Chart of Various Stages in Our Approach independent of its context as well as the document structure.",
        "The main motivation behind formulating this problem in HITS schema is to utilize the hidden link structures among sentences.",
        "HITS stands for ?Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search?",
        "; Originally, this algorithm was developed to rank Web-pages, with a particular insight that some of the webpages (Hubs) served as catalog of information, that could lead users directly to the other pages, which actually contained the information (Authorities).",
        "The intuition behind applying HITS for the task of opinion extraction came from the following assumption about underlying structure of an article.",
        "A news article pertains to a specific theme and with that theme in mind, the author presents certain opinions.",
        "These opinions are justified with the facts present in the article itself.",
        "We conceptualize the opinionated sentences as Hubs and the associated facts for an opinionated sentence as Authorities for this Hub.",
        "To describe the formulation of HITS parameters, let us give the notations.",
        "Let us denote a document D using a set of sentences {S 1 , S 2 , .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", S i , .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", S n }, where n corresponds to the number of sentences in the document D. We construct the sentence graph where nodes in the graph correspond to the sentences in the document.",
        "Let H i and A i denote the hub and authority scores for sentence S i .",
        "In HITS, the edges always flow from a Hub to an Authority.",
        "In the original HITS algorithm, each edge is given the same weight.",
        "However, it has been reported that using weights in HITS update improves the performance significantly (Li et al., 2002).",
        "In our formulation, since each node has a non-zero probablility of acting as a hub as well as an authority, we have outgoing as well as incoming edges for every node.",
        "Therefore, the weights are assigned, keeping in mind the proximity between sentences as well as the probability (of being opinionated/factual) assigned by the classifier.",
        "The following criteria were used for deciding the weight function.",
        "?",
        "An edge in the HITS graph goes from a hub (source node) to an authority (target node).",
        "So, the edge weight from a source node to a target node should be higher if the source node has a high hub score.",
        "?",
        "A fact corresponding to an opinionated sentence should be discussing the same topic.",
        "So, the edge weight should be higher if the sentences are more similar.",
        "?",
        "It is more probable that the facts around an opinion appear closer to that opinionated sentence in the article.",
        "So, the edge weight from a source to target node decreases as the distance between the two sentences increases.",
        "Let W be the weight matrix such that W ij denotes the weight for the edge from the sentence S i to the sentence S j .",
        "Based on the criteria outlined above, we formulate that the weight W ij should be such that W ij ?",
        "H i W ij ?",
        "Sim ij W ij ?",
        "1 dist ij where we use cosine similarity between the sentence vectors to compute Sim ij .",
        "dist ij is simply the number 27 of sentences separating the source and target node.",
        "Various combinations of these factors were tried and will be discussed in section 4.",
        "While factors like sentence similarity and distance are symmetric, having the weight function depend on the hub score makes it asymmetric, consistent with the basic idea of HITS.",
        "Thus, an edge from the sentence S i to S j is given a high weight if S i has a high probability score of being opinionated (i.e., acting as hub) as obtained the classifier.",
        "Now, for applying the HITS algorithm iteratively, the Hubs and Authorities scores for each sentence are initialized using the probability scores assigned by the classifier.",
        "That is, if P i (Opinion) denotes the probability that S i is an opinionated sentence as per the Na?",
        "?ve Bayes Classifier, H i (0) is initialized to P i (Opinion) and A i (0) is initialized to 1 ?",
        "P i (Opinion).",
        "The iterative HITS is then applied as follows: H i (k) = ?",
        "j W ij A i (k ?",
        "1) (1) A i (k) = ?",
        "j W ji H i (k ?",
        "1) (2) where H i (k) denote the hub score for the i th sentence during the k th iteration of HITS.",
        "The iteration is stopped once the mean squared error between the Hub and Authority values at two different iterations is less than a threshold \u000f.",
        "After the HITS iteration is over, five sentences having the highest Hub scores are returned by the system.",
        "4 Experimental Framework and Results The experiment was conducted with 90 news articles in politics domain from Yahoo!",
        "website.",
        "The sentences in the articles were marked as opinionated or factual by a group of annotators.",
        "In the training set, 1393 out of 3142 sentences were found to be opinianated.",
        "In the test set, 347 out of 830 sentences were marked as opinionated.",
        "Out of these 90 articles, 70 articles were used for training the Na?",
        "?ve Bayes classifier as well as for tuning various parameters.",
        "The rest 20 articles were used for testing.",
        "The evaluation was done in an Information Retrieval setting.",
        "That is, the system returns the sentences in a decreasing order of their score (or probability in the case of Na?",
        "?ve Bayes) as being opinionated.",
        "We then utilize the human judgements (provided by the annotators) to compute precision at various points.",
        "Let op(.)",
        "be a binary function for a given rank such that op(r) = 1 if the sentence returned as rank r is opinionated as per the human judgements.",
        "A P@k precision is calculated as follows: P@k = ?",
        "k r=1 op(r) k (3) While the precision at various points indicates how reliable the results returned by the system are, it does not take into account the fact that some of the documents are opinion-rich and some are not.",
        "For the opinion-rich documents, a high P@k value might be similar to picking sentences randomly, whereas for the documents with a very few opinions, even a lower P@k value might be useful.",
        "We, therefore, devise another evaluation metric M@k that indicates the ratio of opinionated sentences at any point, normalized with respect to the ratio of opinionated sentences in the article.",
        "Correspondingly, an M@k value is calculated as M@k = P@k Ratio op (4) where Ratio op denotes the fraction of opinionated sentences in the whole article.",
        "Thus Ratio op = Number of opinionated sentences Number of sentences (5) The parameters that we needed to fix for the HITS algorithm were the weight function W ij and the threshold \u000f at which we stop the iteration.",
        "We varied \u000f from 0.0001 to 0.1 multiplying it by 10 in each step.",
        "The results were not sensitive to the value of \u000f and we used \u000f = 0.01.",
        "For fixing the weight function, we tried out various combinations using the criteria outlined in Section 3.2.",
        "Various weight functions and the corresponding P@5 and M@5 scores are shown in Table 2.",
        "Firstly, we varied k in Sim ij k and found that the square of the similarity function gives better results.",
        "Then, keeping it constant, we varied l in H i l and found the best results for l = 3.",
        "Then, keeping both of these constants, we varied ?",
        "in (?",
        "+ 1 d ).",
        "We found the best results for ?",
        "= 1.0.",
        "With this ?, we tried to vary l again but it only reduced the final score.",
        "Therefore, we fixed the weight function to be W ij = H i 3 (0)Sim ij 2 (1 + 1 dist ij ) (6) Note that H i (0) in Equation 6 corresponds to the probablity assigned by the classifier that the sentence S i is opinionated.",
        "We use the classifier results as the baseline for the comparisons.",
        "The second-stage HITS algorithm is then applied and we compare the performance with respect to the classifier.",
        "Table 3 shows the comparison results for various precision scores for the classifier and the HITS algorithm.",
        "In practical situation, an editor requires quick identification of 3-5 opinionated sentences from the article, which she can then use to formulate questions.",
        "We thus report P@k and M@k values for k = 3 and k = 5.",
        "From the results shown in Table 3, it is clear that applying the second-stage HITS over the Na?",
        "?ve Bayes Classifier improves the performance by a large degree, both in term of P@k and M@k. For instance, the first-stage NB Classifier gives a P@5 of 0.52 and P@3 of 0.53.",

        "M@5 and M@3 scores also improve by 17.7% and 30.8% respectively.",
        "Strikingly, while the classifier gave nearly the same scores for P@k and M@k for k = 3 and k = 5, HITS gave much better results for k = 3 than k = 5.",
        "Specially, the P@3 andM@3 scores obtained by HITS were very encouraging, indicating that the proposed approach helps in pushing the opinionated sentences to the top.",
        "This clearly shows the advantage of using the global structure of the document in contrast with the features extracted from the sentence itself, ignoring the context.",
        "Figures 2 and 3 show the P@5, M@5, P@3 and M@3 scores for individual documents as numbered from 1 to 20 on the X-axis.",

        "For 40% of the articles (numbered 5 to 12) the results provided by HITS were the same as that of the baseline.",
        "For 20% of the articles (numbered 1 to 4) HITS gives a performance lower than that of the baseline.",
        "Thus, for 80% of the documents, the second-stage performs at least as good as the first stage.",
        "This indicates that the second-stage HITS is quite robust.",
        "?",
        "M@5 results are much more robust for the HITS, with 75% of the documents having anM@5 score > 1.",
        "AnM@k score> 1 indicates that the ratio of opinionated sentences in top k sentences, picked up by the algorithm, is higher than the overall ratio in the article.",
        "?",
        "For 45% of the articles, (numbered 6, 9 ?",
        "11 and 15?",
        "20), HITS was able to achieve a P@3 = 1.0.",
        "Thus, for these 9 articles, the top 3 sentences picked up by the algorithm were all marked as opinionated.",
        "The graphs also indicate a high correlation between the results obtained by the NB classifier and HITS.",
        "We used Pearson's correlation to find the correlation strength.",
        "For the P@5 values, the correlation was found to be 0.6021 and for the M@5 values, the correlation was obtained as 0.5954.",
        "In the next section, we will first attempt to further analyze the basic assumption behind using HITS, by looking at some actual Hub-Authority structures, captured by the algorithm.",
        "We will also take some cases of failure and perform error analysis.",
        "5 Discussion First point that we wanted to verify was, whether HITS is really capturing the underlying structure of the document.",
        "That is, are the sentences identified as authorities for a given hub really correspond to the facts supporting the particular opinion, expressed by the hub sentence.",
        "Figure 4 gives two examples of the Hub-Authority structure, as captured by the HITS algorithm, for two different articles.",
        "For each of these examples, we show the sentence identified as Hub in the center along with the top four sentences, identified as Authorities for that hub.",
        "We also give the annotations as to whether the sentences were marked as ?opinionated?",
        "or ?factual?",
        "by the annotators.",
        "In both of these examples, the hubs were actually marked as ?opinionated?",
        "by the annotators.",
        "Additionally, we find that all the four sentences, identified as authorities to the hub, are very relevant to the opinion expressed by the hub.",
        "In the first example, top 3 authority sentences are marked as ?factual?",
        "by the annotator.",
        "Although the fourth sentence is marked as ?opinionated?, it can be seen that this sentence presents a supporting opinion for the hub sentence.",
        "While studying the second example, we found that while the first authority does not present an important fact, the fourth authority surely does.",
        "Both of these 29 (a) Comparison of P@5 values (b) Comparison of M@5 values Figure 2: Comparison Results for 20 Test articles between the Classifier and HITS: P@5 and M@5 (a) Comparison of P@3 values (b) Comparison of M@3 values Figure 3: Comparison Results for 20 Test articles between the Classifier and HITS: P@3 and M@3 (a) Hub-Authority Structure: Example 1 (b) Hub-Authority Structure: Example 2 Figure 4: Example from two different test articles capturing the Hub-Authority Structure were marked as ?factual?",

        "In this particular example, although the second and third authority sentences were annotated as ?opinionated?, these can be seen as supporting the opinion expressed by the hub sentence.",
        "This example also gives us an interesting idea to improve diversification in the final results.",
        "That is, once an opinionated sentence is identified by the algorithm, the hub score of all its suthorities can be reduced proportional to the edge weight.",
        "This will reduce the chances of the supporting opinions being reurned by the system, at a later stage as a main opinion.",
        "We then attempted to test our tool on a recently published article, ?What's Wrong with a Meritocracy Rug??",
        "2 .",
        "The tool could pick up a very 2 http://news.yahoo.com/ whats-wrong-meritocracy-rug-070000354.",
        "html 30 important opinion in the article, ?Most people tend to think that the most qualified person is someone who looks just like them, only younger.",
        "?, which was ranked 2 nd by the system.",
        "The supporting facts and opinions for this sentence, as discovered by the algorithm were also quite relevant.",
        "For instance, the top two authorities corresponding to this sentence hub were: 1.",
        "And that appreciation, we learned painfully, can easily be tinged with all kinds of gendered elements without the person who is making the decisions even realizing it.",
        "2.",
        "And many of the traits we value, and how we value them, also end up being laden with gender overtones.",
        "5.1 Error Analysis We then tried to analyze certain cases of failures.",
        "Firstly, we wanted to understand why HITS was not performing as good as the classifier for 3 articles (Figures 2 and 3).",
        "The analysis revealed that the supporting sentences for the opinionated sentences, extracted by the classifier, were not very similar on the textual level.",
        "Thus a low cosine similarity score resulted in having lower edge weights, thereby getting a lower hub score after applying HITS.",
        "For one of the articles, the sentence picked up by HITS was wrongly annotated as a factual sentence.",
        "Then, we looked at one case of failure due to the error introduced by the classifier prior probablities.",
        "For instance, the sentence, ?The civil war between establishment and tea party Republicans intensified this week when House Speaker John Boehner slammed outside conservative groups for ridiculous pushback against the bipartisan budget agreement which cleared his chamber Thursday.?",
        "was classified as an opinionanted sentence, whereas this is a factual sentence.",
        "Looking closely, we found that the sentence contains three polar words (marked in bold), as well as an advMod dependency between the pair (slammed,when).",
        "Thus the sentence got a high initial prior by the classifier.",
        "As a result, the outgoing edges from this node got a higher H i 3 factor.",
        "Some of the authorities identified for this sentence were: ?",
        "For Democrats, the tea party is the gift that keeps on giving.",
        "?",
        "Tea party sympathetic organizations, Boehner later said, ?are pushing our members in places where they don't want to be?.",
        "which had words, similar to the original sentence, thus having a higher Sim ij factor as well.",
        "We found that these sentences were also very close within the article.",
        "Thus, a high hub prior along with a high outgoing weight gave rise to this sentence having a high hub score after the HITS iterations.",
        "5.2 Online Interface To facilitate easy usage and understanding of the system by others, a web interface has been built for the system 3 .",
        "The webpage caters for users to either input a new article in form of text to get top opinionated sentences or view the output analysis of the system over manually marked test data consisting of 20 articles.",
        "The words in green color are positive polar words, red indicates negative polar words.",
        "Words marked in violet are the root verbs of the sentences.",
        "The colored graph shows top ranked opinionated sentences in yellow box along with top supporting factual sentences for that particluar opinionated sentence in purple boxes.",
        "Snapshots from the online interface are provided in Figures 5 and 6.",
        "6 Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we presented a novel two-stage framework for extracting the opinionated sentences in the news articles.",
        "The problem of identifying top opinionated sentences from news articles is very challenging, especially because the opinions are not as explicit in a news article as in a discussion forum.",
        "It was also evident from the inter-annotator agreement and the kappa coefficient was found to be 0.71.",
        "The experiments conducted over 90 News articles (70 for training and 20 for testing) clearly indicate that the proposed two-stage method almost always improves the performance of the baseline classifier-based approach.",
        "Specifically, the improvements are much higher for P@3 and M@3 scores (35.8% and 30.8% over the NB classifier).",
        "An M@3 score of 1.5 and P@3 score of 0.72 indicates that the proposed method was able to push the opinionated sentences to the top.",
        "On an average, 2 out of top 3 sentences returned by the system were actually opinionated.",
        "This is very much desired in a practical scenario, where an editor requires quick identification of 3-5 opinionated sentences, which she can then use to formulate questions.",
        "The examples discussed in Section 5 bring out another important aspect of the proposed algorithm.",
        "In addition to the main objective of extracting the opinionated sentences within the article, the proposed method actually discovers the underlying structure of the article and would certainly be useful to present various opinions, grouped with supporting facts as well as supporting opinions in the article.",
        "While the initial results are encouraging, there is scope for improvement.",
        "We saw that the results obtained via HITS were highly correlated with the Na?",
        "?ve Bayes classifier results, which were used in assigning a weight to the document graph.",
        "One direction for the future work would be to experiment with other features to improve the precision of the classifier.",
        "Additionally, in the current evaluation, we are not evaluating the degree of diversity of the opinions returned by the system.",
        "The Hub-Authority 3 available at http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/ resgrp/cnerg/temp2/final.php 31 Figure 5: Screenshot from the Web Interface Figure 6: Hub-Authority Structure as output on the Web Interface structure of the second example gives us an interesting idea to improve diversification and we would like to implement that in future.",
        "In the future, we would also like to apply this work to track an event over time, based on the opinionated sentences present in the articles.",
        "When an event occurs, articles start out with more factual sentences.",
        "Over time, opinions start surfacing on the event, and as the event matures, opinions predominate the facts in the articles.",
        "For example, a set of articles on a plane crash would start out as factual, and would offer expert opinions over time.",
        "This work can be used to plot the maturity of the media coverage by keeping track of facts v/s opinions on any event, and this can be used by organizations to provide a timeline for the event.",
        "We would also like to experiment with this model on a different media like microblogs.",
