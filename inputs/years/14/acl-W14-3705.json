        "Although real-world events have exact spatiotemporal extent, event mentions in text are often spatially and temporally vague.",

        "If not ad-dressed, these issues hinder event-based inference.",
        "Research efforts in event extraction have focused on either extracting temporal relations (Pustejovsky et al., 2003a; UzZaman et al., 2013) or recognizing spatial relations (Mani et al., 2010; Roberts et al., 2013) between events.",
        "Apart from being difficult to recognize, temporal and spatial containment ?",

        "do not suffice to infer that one event is a part of another.",
        "Temporally, an event may happen during another event and not be a part of it, as in (1).",
        "(1) In the midst of the World War II, the Argentinian government reduced rents.",
        "In this case, ?the reduction of rents in Argentina?",
        "happened during ?the World War II,?",
        "but was not part of it.",
        "Conversely, an event may occur within the spatial extent of another event and not be a part of it, as shown by (2).",
        "(2) The fire destroyed 60% of London after almost 30,000 people died from plague.",
        "The spatial extent of ?destruction by fire?",
        "is contained within the extent of ?people dying from plague,?",
        "but the former is not a part of the latter.",
        "An event e 1 is a part of event e 2 if and only if e 1 is spatially and temporally contained within e 2 .",
        "In previous research (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008; Jans et al., 2012), news narratives were mod-eled as chains of events involving the same participants.",
        "Such script-like representations, how-ever, do not account for the non-linear (hierarchi- cal) nature of events.",
        "In contrast, in this work we model the structure of events in a narrative via relations of spatiotemporal containment (STC) between event mentions, effectively inducing a hierarchy of events.",
        "We construct directed acyclic graphs of event mentions, in which edges denote STC relations between events.",
        "We call this structure an event hierarchy directed acyclic graph (EHDAG).",
        "We propose a two-step approach for constructing EHDAGs from news.",
        "We first detect the STC relations between pairs of event mentions in a supervised fashion, building on our previous approach (Glava's et al., 2014).",
        "We then enforce structural coherence over local predictions, framing the task as a constrained optimization problem, which we solve using Integer Linear Programming (ILP).",
        "2 Related Research Introduction of the TimeML standard (Pustejovsky et al., 2003a) and the TimeBank corpus (Puste- jovsky et al., 2003b) triggered a surge of research on extraction of temporal relations, much of which within TempEval campaigns (Verhagen et al., 2010; UzZaman et al., 2013).",
        "More recently, following the emergence of the SpatialML standard (Mani et al., 2010), Roberts et al. (2013) have proposed an annotation scheme and the supervised model for extracting spatial relations between events.",

        "Chambers and Jurafsky (2008) consider narratives to be chains of temporally ordered events linked by a common protagonist.",

        "Similarly to Bramsen et al. (2006), we use an ILP formulation of global coherence over local decisions, but consider STC relations between events rather than temporal relations between textual segments.",
        "3 Constructing Coherent Hierarchies As an example, consider the following news snip-pet, with the corresponding EHDAG shown in Fig. 1: (3) Obama sparred with Vladimir Putin over how to end the war in Syria on Monday during an icy encounter at a G8 summit.",

        "3.1 Spatiotemporal Containment Classifier We first describe the classifier used for predicting local STC relations.",
        "The classifier is given a pair of event mentions, (e 1 , e 2 ), where mention e 1 occurs in text before mention e 2 .",
        "The classifier predicts one of the following relations: (1) e 1 SUBSUPER e 2 , denoting that the e 1 (subevent) is spatiotemporally contained by event e 2 (superevent); (2) e 1 SUPERSUB e 2 , denoting that e 1 (superevent) spatiotemporally contains e 2 (subevent); and (3) NOREL, denoting that neither of the two events spatiotemporally contains the other.",

        "Syntactic features: All dependency relations on the path between events in the dependency tree and features that indicate whether one of the features syntactically governs the other.",

        "We use a feature indicating whether one event mention or any of its derivatives (obtained from CatVar) is a WordNet hypernym of (for nomi-nalized mentions) or entailed from (for verb men-tions) the other mention (or any of its deriva-tives).",
        "We use an additional feature to indicate the VerbOcean relation between the event mentions, if such exists.",
        "Unlike features from previous groups, 35 knowledge-based features have not been used often for temporal relation classification.",
        "We employ a L2-regularized logistic regression as our pairwise classification model, which is motivated by the high-dimensional feature space spanned by the lexical features Moreover, the global coherence component of the model requires probability distributions for local decisions over relation types.",
