        "In Automatic Genre Identification (AGI), documents are classified based on their genres rather than their topics or subjects.",
        "Genre classes such as editorial, interview, news and blog which are recognizable by their distinct purposes, can be on any topic.",
        "The most important application of AGI could be in Information Retrieval.",
        "If a user could use the search engine to retrieve web pages from a specific genre such as news articles, reviews or blogs, search results could be more beneficial.",
        "With the aim of enhancing search engines, AGI has attracted a lot of attention (see Section 2).",
        "In this paper, we investigate two important open questions in AGI.",
        "The first question is: what set of features produces the best result in genre classification on the web?",
        "The drawbacks of existing genre-annotated web corpora (low inter-coder agreement; false correlations between topic and genre classes) resulted in researchers?",
        "doubt on the outcomes of classification models based on these corpora (Sharoff et al., 2010).",
        "Therefore, in order to answer this question, we perform genre classification with a wide range of features on a reliable and source diverse genre-annotated web corpus.",
        "The second question that we investigate in this paper is: could we exploit the graph structure of the web to increase genre classification accu-racy?",
        "With the aim of learning from the neighbouring web pages, we investigated the performance of a semi-supervised graph-based model, which is a novel technique in genre classification.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "After reviewing related work in Section 2, we compare different supervised genre classification models based on various lexical, POS-based and text statistics features in Section 3.",
        "Section 4 describes our semi-supervised graph-based classification experiment, where we use the multi-class min-cut algorithm as a novel technique in genre classification.",
        "Section 5 concludes the findings and discusses future work.",
        "2 Related Work There has been a considerable body of research in AGI.",
        "In previous studies on automatic genre classification of web pages, various types of features such as common words (Stamatatos et al., 2000), function words (Argamon et al., 1998), word unigrams (Freund et al., 2006), character n-grams (Kanaris and Stamatatos, 2007), part-of-speech tags (Karlgren and Cutting, 1994) , part-of-speech trigrams (Argamon et al., 1998; San-tini, 2007), document statistics (e.g. average sentence length, average word length and type/token ratio) (Finn and Kushmerick, 2006; Kessler et 39 al., 1997), HTML tags (e.g. (Santini, 2007)) have been explored.",
        "However, researchers conducted genre classification experiments with different features on different corpora with different sets of genre labels.",
        "As a result, it is difficult to compare them.",
        "This motivated Sharoff et al. (2010) to examine a wide range of word-based, character-based and POS-based features on the existing genre-annotated corpora.",
        "They reported that word unigrams and character 4-grams outperform other features in genre classification.",
        "However, they concluded that the results cannot be trusted because of two main reasons.",
        "First, some of these collections exhibit low inter-coder agreement and any results based on unreliable data could be misleading.",
        "Second, the spurious correlation between topic and genre classes in some of these corpora was one of the reasons for some of the very impressive results reported by Sharoff et al. (2010).",
        "These good results were achieved by detecting topics rather than genres of individual texts.",
        "A similar point was made by Petrenz and Webber (2010) who examined the impact of topic change on the performance of AGI systems.",
        "They showed that a shift in topic can have a massive impact on genre classification models which are based on lexical features such as word unigrams or character n-grams.",
        "Therefore, the question which set of features produces the best result in automatic genre classification on the web is still an open question.",
        "In order to investigate this ques-tion, we perform genre classification with a wide range of features on a reliable and topically diverse dataset.",
        "Section 3.1 describes the dataset and the experimental setup.",
        "Most of the current works in the field of AGI concentrated on extracting features from the content of the documents and classify them by employing a standard supervised algorithm.",
        "How-ever, on the web there are other sources of information which can be utilized to improve genre classification of web pages.",
        "For instance, the web has a graph structure and web pages are connected via hyper-links.",
        "These connections could be exploited to improve genre classification.",
        "Various graph-based classification algorithms have been proposed to improve topic classification for web pages, such as the relaxation labelling algorithm (Chakrabarti et al., 1998), iterative classification algorithm (Lu and Getoor, 2003), Markov logic networks (Crane and McDowell, 2012), random graph walk (Lin and Cohen, 2010) and weighted-vote relational neighbour algorithm (Macskassy and Provost, 2007).",
        "These classification algorithms which utilize hyper-link connections between web pages to construct graphs, outperformed the classifiers which are solely based on textual content of the web pages for topic classification.",
        "Such connected data presents opportunities for boosting the performance of genre classification too.",
        "Graph-based web page classification presented in studies such as (Crane and McDowell, 2012; Lu and Getoor, 2003; Macskassy and Provost, 2007) on the WebKB dataset (CRAVEN, 1998) could be considered as genre classification as opposed to topic classification.",
        "The WebKB dataset contains web pages from four computer science departments categorised into seven classes: stu-dent, faculty, staff, department, course, project and other.",
        "However, this dataset is very specific to the academic domain with low coverage for the web overall, whereas we examine graph-based learning for automatic genre classification of web pages on a much more general dataset with popular genre classes such as news, blog and editorial.",
        "Moreover, the graph-based algorithms used on the WebKB dataset are all supervised and were performed on a very clean and noise free dataset which was achieved by removing the class other.",
        "Class other contains all the web pages which do not belong to any other predefined classes.",
        "How-ever, our experiment is in a semi-supervised manner which is a much more realistic scenario on the web, because it is highly unlikely that for each web page, we have genre labels for all its neighbouring web pages as well.",
        "Therefore, we perform our experiment on a very noisy dataset where neighbouring web pages could belong to none of our predefined genre classes.",
        "Section 4 describes our semi-supervised graph-based classification ex-periment, where we use a multi-class min-cut algorithm as a novel technique in genre classification.",
        "3 Content-based Classification 3.1 Dataset and Experimental Setup Petrenz and Webber (2010) and Sharoff et al. (2010) emphasize that the impact of topic on genre classification should be eliminated or controlled.",
        "In order to avoid the influence of topic on genre classification, some researchers (e.g. (Sta- 40 Number of # of pages from Genre the same website Fleiss's ?",

        "To save space, in this paper we use the abbreviation of genre labels which are specified after the genre names.",
        "matatos et al., 2000) and (Argamon et al., 1998)) use only topic independent features such as common words or function words in genre classification.",
        "However, neither of these features are exclusive to genre classification.",
        "Function words and common words are used in authorship classification (e.g. (Argamon et al., 2007)) because they can capture the style of the authors without being influenced by the topics of the texts.",
        "On the other hand, word unigrams are a popular document representation in topic classification.",
        "If we want these models to capture the genre of documents without being influenced by their topics or the style of their authors, we must eliminate the influence of these factors on genre classification by keeping them constant across the genre classes in the training data.",
        "That means all the documents in the training set should be about the same topic and written by the same person.",
        "However, constructing such a dataset is practically impossible for genre classes on the web.",
        "The other more practical solution to this problem would be to collect data from various topics and sources in order to minimize the impact of these factors on genre classification.",
        "For that reason, we (Asheghi et al., 2014) created a web genre annotated corpus which is reliable (with Fleiss's kappa (Fleiss, 1971) equal to 0.874) and source diverse.",
        "We tried to reduce the influence of topic, the writing style of the authors as well as the design of the websites on genre classification by collecting data from various sources and topics.",
        "The corpus consists of 3964 web pages from 2522 different websites, distributed across 15 genres (Table 1).",
        "Moreover, we prepared two versions of the corpus: the original text and the main text corpora.",
        "First, we converted web pages to plain text by removing HTML markup using the Krd-Wrd tool (Steger and Stemle, 2009).",
        "This resulted in the original text corpus which contains individual web pages with all the textual elements present on them.",
        "Moreover, in order to investigate the influence of boilerplate parts (e.g. advertise-ments, headers, footers, template materials, navigation menus and lists of links) of the web pages on genre classification, we removed the boilerplate parts and extracted the main text of each web page using the justext tool 1 .",
        "This resulted in the creation of the main text corpus.",
        "This is the first time that the performance of genre classification models is compared on both the original and the main text of the web pages.",
        "Since the outputs of the justext tool for 518 of the web pages were empty files, the main text corpus has fewer pages.",
        "However, the main text corpus still has a balanced distribution with a relatively large number of web pages per category.",
        "Table 2 compares the number of web pages in the two versions of the corpus.",
        "For all the experiments we use this corpus via 10-fold cross-validation on the web pages.",
        "Also, in order to minimize the effect of factors such as topic, the writing style of the authors and the design of the websites even further, we ensured that all the web pages from the same website are in the same fold.",
        "Many, if not all of the previous studies in automatic genre classification on the web ignored this essential step when dividing the data into folds.",
        "For machine learning, we 1 http://code.google.com/p/justext/ 41 Number of web pages in corpora Genre Original text Main text php 304 221 com 264 190 edu 299 191 blog 244 242 shop 292 221 instruction 231 229 recipe 332 243 news 330 320 editorial 310 307 forum 280 251 bio 242 242 faq 201 160 review 266 262 story 184 184 interview 185 183 Table 2: Number of web pages in individual genre classes in both original text and main text corpora.",
        "chose Support Vector Machines (SVM) because it has been shown by other researchers in AGI (e.g. (Santini, 2007)) that SVM produces better or at least similar results compared to other machine learning algorithms.",
        "We used the one-versus-one multi-class SVM implemented in Weka 2 with the default setting.",
        "All the experiments are carried out on both the original text and the main text corpora.",
        "3.2 Features In order to compare the performance of different lexical and structural features used in previous work, we reimplemented the following published approaches to AGI: function words (Argamon et al., 1998), part-of-speech n-grams (Santini, 2007), word unigrams (Freund et al., 2006) and character 4-grams binary representation (Sharoff et al., 2010).",
        "We also explored the discriminative power of other features such as readability features (Pitler and Nenkova, 2008), HTML tags 3 and named entity tags in genre classification (Table 3).",
        "This is the first time that some of these features such as average depth of syntax trees and entity coherence features (Barzilay and Lapata, 2008) are used for genre classification.",
        "To set a base-line, we used a list of genre names (e.g. news, editorial, in-terview, review) as features.",
        "We used two different feature representations: binary and normalized frequency.",
        "In the binary representation of a doc-ument, the value for each feature is either one or zero which represents the presence or the absence of each feature respectively.",
        "In the normalized fre-2 http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ 3 http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref byfunc.asp quency representation of a document, the value for each feature is the frequency of that feature which is normalized by the length of the document.",
        "For extracting lexical features, we tokenized each document using the Stanford tokenizer (in- cluded as part of the Stanford part of speech tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003)) and converted all the tokens to lower case.",
        "For extracting POS tags and named entity tags, we used the Stanford maximum entropy tagger 4 and the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer 5 respectively.",
        "For extracting some of the readability features such as average parse tree height and average number of noun and verb phrases per sentences, we used the Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003).",
        "However, web pages must be cleaned before they can be fed to a parser, because parsers cannot handle tables and list of links.",
        "Therefore, we only used the main text of each web page as an input to the parser.",
        "For web pages for which the justext tool produced empty files, we treated these features as missing values.",
        "Moreover, we used the Brown Coherence Toolkit 6 to construct the entity grid for each web page and computed the probability of each entity transition type.",
        "This tool needs the parsed version of the text as an input.",
        "Therefore, for web pages for which the justext tool produced empty files, we also treated these features as missing values.",
        "3.3 Results and Discussion Table 4 shows the result of the different feature sets listed in the previous section on both the original text and the main text corpora.",
        "At first glance, we see that the results of genre classification on the original text corpus are higher than the main text corpus.",
        "This shows that boiler plates contain valuable information which helps genre classification.",
        "Moreover, the results show that binary representation of word unigrams is the best performing feature set when we use the whole text of the web pages.",
        "However, on the main text corpus, character 4-grams outperform other features.",
        "This confirms the results reported in (Sharoff et al., 2010).",
        "The results also highlight that the performance of POS-based features are much less accurate than that of textual features such as word unigrams and character n-grams.",
        "The results also show that the combination of word unigrams, text statistics and 4 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml 5 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml 6 http://www.cs.brown.edu/ melsner/manual.html 42 Category Features Token features number of tokens and number of types normalized frequency of punctuation marks and currency characters Named entity tags normalized frequency of tags: time, location, organization, person, money, date average parse tree height average sentence length and word length Readability features standard deviation of sentence length and of word length average number of syllables per word type/token ratio average number of noun phrases and verb phrases per sentence entity coherence features (Barzilay and Lapata, 2008) HTML tags normalized frequency of tags for: sections / style, formatting, programming, visual features such as forms, images, lists and tables Table 3: List of text statistics features explored in this paper part of speech features resulted in improving genre classification accuracy (compared to the accuracy achieved by word unigrams alone), for both original and main text corpora.",
        "However, while the improvement for the main text corpus is statistically significant 7 , there is no significant difference between these two models for the original corpus.",
        "Surprisingly, adding part of speech 3-grams to the word unigrams features decreased the genre classification accuracy in both original and main text corpora.",
        "The reason could be that the model is over-fitted on the training data and as a result, it performs poorly on the test data.",
        "Therefore, combining various features will not always improve the performance of the classification task.",
        "More-over, for extracting POS-based features and some of the text statistics features we rely on tools such as part-of-speech taggers and parsers whose performance varies for different genres.",
        "Even the best part-of-speech taggers and parsers are error prone and cannot be trusted on new unseen genres.",
        "4 Graph-based Classification Until now we extracted features only from the content of the web pages.",
        "However, other sources of information such as the connections and the link patterns between the web pages could be exploited to improve genre classification.",
        "The underlying assumption of this approach is that a page is more likely to be connected to pages with the same genre category.",
        "For example, if the neighbouring web pages of a particular web page are labelled as shop, it is more likely that this web page is a shop too, whereas, it is highly unlikely that it is a news or editorial.",
        "This property (i.e. entities with similar labels are more likely to be connected) is known as homophily (Sen et al., 2008).",
        "We hy-7 McNemar test at the significance level of 5% pothesis that homophily exists for genre classes and it can help us to improve genre classification on the web.",
        "In this paper, we use a semi-supervised graph-based algorithm namely, multi-class min-cut, which is a novel approach in genre classification.",
        "This algorithm, which is a collective classification method, considers the class labels of all the web pages within a graph.",
        "4.1 Multi-class Min-cut: The Main Idea The Min-cut classification algorithm originally proposed by Blum and Chawla (2001) is based on the idea that linked entities have a tendency to belong to the same class.",
        "In other words, it is based on the homophily assumption.",
        "There-fore, it should be able to improve genre classification on the web if our hypothesis holds.",
        "However, this technique is a binary classification algorithm, whereas, we have a multi-class problem.",
        "Unfor-tunately, multi-class min-cut is NP-hard and there is no exact solution for it.",
        "Nevertheless, Ganchev and Pereira (2007) proposed a multi-class extension to Blum and Chawla (2001)'s min-cut algorithm by encoding a multi-class min-cut problem as an instance of metric labelling.",
        "Kleinberg and Tardos (1999; 2002) introduced metric labelling for the first time.",
        "The main idea of metric labelling for web page classification can be described as fol-lows: Assume we have a weighted and undirected graph G = (V,E) where each vertex v ?",
        "V is a web page and the edges represent the hyper-links between the web pages.",
        "The task is to classify these web pages into a set of labels L. This task can be denoted as a function f : V ?",
        "L. In order to do this labelling task in an optimal way, we need to minimize two different types of costs.",
        "First, there is a non-negative cost c(v, l) for assigning label l 43 Feature set Original text Main text genre names bin 57.39 29.02 genre name nf 38.29 14.16 function words bin 65.71 55.57 function words nf 74.95 66.86 word unigrams bin 89.32 76.61 word unigrams nf 85.21 74.91 character 4-grams bin 87.96 78.88 POS-3grams bin 73.18 61.23 POS-3grams nf 70.28 57.83 POS-2grams bin 64.10 54.91 POS-2grams nf 68.94 60.76 POS nf 60.14 54.64 text statistics 55.47 59.17 word unigrams bin + text statistics 89.48 78.09 word uni-grams bin + text statistics + POS nf 89.63 78.24 word uni-grams bin + POS 3-grams bin 88.14 75.59 Table 4: Classification accuracy of different features in genre classification.",

        "d(f(v 1 ), f(v 2 )) where d(., .)",
        "denotes distance between the two labels.",
        "A big distance value between labels indicates less similarity between them.",
        "Therefore, the total cost of labelling task f is: (1) E(f) = ?",
        "v?V c(v, f(v)) + ?",
        "e=(v 1 ,v 2 )?E w e ?",
        "d(f(v 1 ), f(v 2 )) Kleinberg and Tardos (1999; 2002) developed an algorithm for minimizing E(f).",
        "However, their algorithm uses linear programming which is impractical for large data (Boykov et al., 2001).",
        "In a separate study for metric labelling problems, Boykov et al. (2001) have developed a multi-way min-cut algorithm to minimize E(f).",
        "This algorithm is very fast and can be applied to large-scale problems with good performance (Boykov et al., 2001).",
