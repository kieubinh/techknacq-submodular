        "& Background Statistical patterns in language use are evident at many levels and have proved useful in an increasingly wide range of computational and cognitive applications.",
        "Statistical regularities offer a way to quantify and model how people create, encode and use knowledge about the world.",
        "Statements specifically about ?what things are?",
        "(ie.",
        "ontological statements) offer uniquely transparent evidence about peoples?",
        "knowledge of the world.",
        "Our research adopts a corpus-based approach in which networks of predications are analyzed to assess the underlying structure of ontological assertions.",
        "Word-word predications, observed as the copular is-a form in English, are important because, unlike most grammatical constructions that have few semantic constraints, predications tend to imply category membership or equivalence.",
        "Take (i) and (ii) for example: (i) Safety is always a primary concern.",
        "(ii) This organization is an institution where [...].",
        "(i) is a category assertion (safety as a type of con-cern) and (ii) is an equivalence assertion (organi- zation is an institution).",
        "Most predications can be interpreted as category memberships like (i); explicit articulation of equivalence is actually quite rare in language (Cimiano, 2006; Cimiano and V?olker, 2005).",
        "Although some categorical predications are metaphorical, many of these are interpreted using category matching or analogical mapping processes (Glucksberg et al., 1997; Bowdle and Gentner, 2005).",
        "In both semantic interpreta-tions, predications naturally form a directed network of words.",
        "Consisting primarily of category assertions, the structure of this network should exhibit a degree of natural clustering owing natural categories of the those things it represents.",
        "Network representations of language have been used to describe a wide range of structures in lan-guage, including word-word and word-document co-occurrences, term collocations, dependency structure and named entity relations.",
        "Networks of grammatical relations have been found to differentiate word-classes (Ferrer i Cancho et al., 2004) and semantic networks can be used to model vocabulary growth (Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005).",
        "Co-occurrence networks, which are perhaps the most widely studied natural language network, are the foundation of many vector-space models (Lan- dauer and Dumais, 1997; Turney et al., 2010) and can be used to mine synonyms (Cohen et al., 2005), disambiguate word senses (Agirre et 48 al., 2014; Biemann, 2006) and even help mark the quality of essays (Foltz et al., 1999).",
        "Spectral methods applied to linguistic networks have been used to differentiate languages (Ferrer i Cancho et al., 2004), word-classes (Sun and Korho-nen, 2009) and genres of text (Ferrer i Cancho et al., 2007).",
        "Using spectral methods, research has also found that syntactic and semantic distributional similarity networks have considerably different structure (Biemann et al., 2009).",
        "The use of lexical graphs (networks of words) in particu-lar, pre-dates modern NLP (Rapoport et al., 1966), though the approach continues to influence a variety of NLP and information retrieval tasks like summarization and retrieval (Erkan and Radev, 2004; V?eronis, 2004).",
        "Network-based methods have even used community detection, similar to the algorithm described in this paper, to extract specialist terms from sets of multi-theme documents (Grineva et al., 2009) as well as unstructured texts (Gerow, 2014).",
        "Because predications naturally form directed chains of ontological assertions, we hypothesize that their underlying structure is systematic and modular, given its representation of naturally organized things in the world.",
        "Our method employs community detection on networks of noun-noun predications as a way to assess the overall structure of predication, but it could be extended to hypernym and category extraction tasks (Hearst, 1992; Caraballo, 1999).",
        "Specifically, we test for community structure in predications and explore whether this structure becomes more highly resolved when using a semantic measure of predication strength introduced in the following section.",
        "We also predict that central nodes (i.e. words) in individual modules will correlate to categorical super-ordinance or hypernymy.",
        "Thus, we first seek to assess the overall community structure of predication, testing whether or not it is more resolved using a novel measure of predication strength.",
        "Second, within communities of predi-cations, we compare the words?",
        "closeness centrality to their positions in WordNet's hypernym tree (Miller, 1995).",
        "2 Method Unlike co-occurrence networks, where words are related simply by proximity, predication networks are built using extracted grammatical relationships.",
        "The implied relationship in a co-occurrence network provides a natural way to weight edges, but predications have no analogue to a proximity-based weighting scheme.",
        "One option would be to weight edges by the number of times given predications were observed.",
        "While this is perhaps the most obvious way to account for important predi-cations, it risks exaggerating high-frequency items that are common for reasons other than importance (perhaps they are idioms, collocates or found in abnormally strong colligational structures).",
        "Frequency weighting would also be susceptible to noise from the many low-frequency items.",
        "To address these concerns, we introduce a semantically informed measure of predication relevance.",
        "Wilks?",
        "(1975; 1978) theory of preference semantics proposes that subject- and object-verb relationships evince ?selectional preference?, which can be thought of as the disposition verbs have to select certain arguments ?",
        "particular classes of subjects or objects.",
        "To operationalize selectional preference, Resnik (1997) introduced selectional preference strength to measure the disposition or ?preference?",
        "of a verb, v: S R (v) = ?",
        "c?C P (c|v) log P (c|v) P (c) (1) where C is a set of semantic classes from which v can select and R is the grammatical relation in question.",
        "Note that S R (v) is effectively the sum K-L divergence between the probabilities of v and c for all classes.",
        "In a corpus-based setting, the probability of any word can be estimated by its relative frequency: P (x) = f(x) ?",
        "i f(x i ) .",
        "Resnik goes on to define a measure of selectional association between a verb and a specific class, c: A R (v, c) = 1 S R (v) P (c|v) log P (c|v) P (c) (2) In the typical form of selectional preference induction ?",
        "the task of estimating likelihoods over all classes ?",
        "Eq. 2 is used to measure a verb's preference for classes of nominal subjects or objects like vehicles, insects, birds, etc.",
        "(Resnik, 1997; Shutova et al., 2013).",
        "To test our assumptions regarding the modular structure of predications in English, a measure like selectional association should account for predicates?",
        "diversity (or uniformity) of attachment.",
        "That is, the preference a predicate has to 49 operate on a wide or narrow range of words.",
        "To account for this, we add a term, U(p), to account for the relative number of unique words a predicate p has been observed to predicate.",
        "Note that this is not the total number of predications involving p, which would produce problematically high values were p to collocate strongly with the words it predicates.",
        "Instead, U(p) addresses and normalizes for the diversity with which p is applied.",
        "Additionally, instead of using a pre-set collection of semantic classes on which predication is assumed to oper-ate, each predicate is treated as its own class.",
        "For a predication consisting of word w predicated by p, predication strength is defined as follows: PS(w, p) = 1 S R (p) log P (w|p) U(p)P (w) (3) PS thus combines three important properties of predications: the relative frequency of a given predication P (w|p), the relative frequency of a word P (w) and the diversity of a word's potential predications U(p).",
        "Defined like this, U(p) helps diminish the contribution of predicates that are widely applicable, under the assumption that being widely used, they are in-fact somewhat less significant.",
        "Using this measure to weight edges in a predication network should help diminish the contribution of exceptionally frequent predications as well as that from low-frequency predications without excluding them.",
        "An example predication network is shown in Figure 1.",
        "In these networks, a network is constructed over a set of documents where nodes are the words in a predication, the direction following the is-a link.",
        "Thus, example (i) would result in a link from safety to concern with weight 1.",
        "Were another predication involving concern to be observed, another edge would be added from that node.",
        "Note that circularities are allowed even though this example is acyclic.",
        "To assess predication strength as a relevance function, we compare the community structure of weighted and unweighted networks.",
        "The example in Figure 1 shows a sample network (top) and the communities extracted from the unweighted and weighted versions of the same network (middle and bottom).",
        "Note the changes in community assignments from the unweighted version to the weighted.",
        "In par-ticular, observe the new clusters in the weighted network around money, factor and murder.",

        "50 intuitions about the systematic nature of linguistic predication is correct, there should be at least a moderate degree of community structure in the unweighted networks, and if predication displays semantic preference similar to selectional associa-tion, this community structure should be stronger for networks weighted by predication strength.",

        "The BNC contained about 112 million tokens and the enTenTen collection has 3.2 billion tokens.",
        "For each collec-tion, the top 1,000 most frequent nouns provided a seed set from which to extract all predicate and predicate of relations 2 (see examples in Table 1).",
        "For the BNC, this resulted in 40,721 predications (14,319 unique) and 260,555 (20,651 unique) for the enTenTen collection.",
        "Predication strength scores were computed for every predication using within-corpus relative frequencies.",
        "These scores were used to weight edges in one version of the predication network, whereas the edge-weights of the ?unweighted?",

        "Two methods were used to extract communities from the predication networks: the Infomap and walktrap algorithms.",
        "By using two methods, we attain some assurance that our findings are not ar-tifacts of the assumptions underlying either algorithm.",
        "The Infomap algorithm is an information-theoretic method that exploits the analogue between optimizing a compression dictionary and simplifying a graph by describing ?flow?",
        "through nodes (Rosvall and Bergstrom, 2008).",
        "Infomap assumes edges in a network induce such flow and by deriving a minimum description of this flow, the algorithm can find multi-level communities in large networks (Rosvall and Bergstrom, 2011).",
        "The second method, walktrap, operationalizes the intuition that a large set of short random walks on a network will leave walkers on some groups of nodes more often than others (Pons and Latapy, 2005).",
        "By setting the walk distance to a small value, relative to a network's density, walkers will tend toward communities if the walker sample is sufficient.",
        "These algorithms are both known to work well with large, directed networks and neither imposed intractable computational burdens at our scale (Fortunato, 2010; Lancichinetti and For-tunato, 2009).",
        "Because both algorithms require a connected network, our analysis is restricted to the largest connected component (LCC) for all net-works, though we have no reason to believe results would differ significantly for other components.",
        "Community assignments can be assessed by measuring how self-contained or ?modular?",
        "the resulting communities are.",
        "Modularity was introduced as a way to choose the level of an optimal cut for hierarchical partitioning algorithms, analogous to the level in the dendrogram that yields the best communities (Newman and Girvan, 2004).",
        "For a network with adjacency matrix A and community assignments c, modularity is defined as: Q = 1 2m ?",
        "ij A ij ?",
        "k i k j 2m ?",
        "(c i , c j ) (4) where m is the number of edges and k i is the degree of node i.",
        "?",
        "(c i , c j ) is 1 when the community assignment of node i is the same as that for node j. Modularity measures how likely it is that nodes in a community are connected to one another as opposed to nodes in other communities.",
        "Modularity is defined from -1.0 to 1.0 and graphs where Q > 0.6 are conventionally said to have relatively strong community structure (New- 51 man, 2010).",
        "Here, we use modularity instead of a measure of semantic similarity or semantic coherence because predication is seldom an assertion of equivalence or similarity.",
        "This means that although words in predication communities may be related in an ontological sense, such an assessment would not expose the level of independence between the communities.",
        "Weighted and unweighted networks from both corpora were submitted to each community detection algorithm, the results of which were assessed using modularity.",
        "We also carried out this analysis on frequency-weighted networks, the results of which were similar to the unweighted config-uration, but are not reported for sake of brevity.",
        "Figure 2 shows the modularity for each configuration with varying minimum predication frequency (the number of times a predication had to occur to be included).",
        "Varying the minimum frequency thresholds helps simulate the effect of corpus-size on the algorithm.",
        "In the BNC, unweighted networks with no minimum edge frequency show slight modularity (Q = 0.30), whereas in weighted networks it is quite strong (Q = 0.89).",
        "The enTenTen corpus exhibits a gap between the unweighted (Q = 0.61) and weighted networks (Q = 0.88) at low edge thresholds.",
        "This shows that predication strength is helpful in weighting relevant items without excluding low-frequency observations.",
        "The lower modularity scores (Q; Eq. 4) in the unweighted networks may be due to more novel, loose or figurative associations found in low-frequency predications that inappropriately connect unrelated communities.",
        "Interestingly, scores for unweighted and weighted networks converge up to a point as the minimum frequency increases (reducing the size of the network).",
        "This pruning is helpful for the unweighted networks, but has little effect on the weighted versions.",
        "In all cases, sparsity takes a toll as the LCC becomes quite small.",
        "The reason for the eventual decline as the LCC shrinks below 70 nodes is because communities are less likely to form at all in small networks.",
        "In addition to the highly modular structure, the communities of predications themselves are likely to represent some semantic organization.",
        "Specifi-cally, we looked for a categorical structure within the communities by comparing words to the hypernym tree in WordNet (Miller, 1995).",
        "Intu-itively, one would expect words that are central in Figure 2: Modularity of predication networks in the BNC (top) and enTenTen (bottom).",
        "Note, as the minimum frequency increases (bottom axis) and the LCC contains fewer and fewer nodes (top axis), the community detection algorithms may not produce a solution with more than one com-munity, resulting in undefined modularity.",
        "a community to be members of higher-level categories.",
        "In figure 1, for example, summer, hour and holiday all point to time, one could infer that time is a shared hypernym.",
        "We use closeness centrality, a graph-theoretic measure of node's average proximity to other nodes, as a within-community measure of super-ordinance (i.e. hypernymy).",
        "Though there a number of network centrality measures, closeness centrality is a robust measure, though it tends not to scale well to larger networks because it requires computing the distance between every pair of nodes (Friedl et al., 2010).",
        "52 The centrality scores in the communities were compared to WordNet using the first sense-entry for each node (which is typically the most com-mon) and words not found in the tree were discarded.",
        "For the unweighted networks across both corpora, we found a mean Spearman correlation of r=0.35 (p < 0.01; using Fisher's transformation) for the Infomap algorithm and r=0.38 (p < 0.01) for walktrap.",
        "In the weighted versions, Infomap produced r=0.41 (p < 0.01) and walktrap produced r=0.44 (p < 0.01).",
        "This confirms that predication communities tend to specify categorical knowledge is moderately similar to WordNet.",
        "Note these correlation values are comparable between the weighted and unweighted networks, implying that relevance, as selectional association, is not an important marker of the communities?",
        "hypernymic composition.",
        "4 Discussion The analysis in this paper is an attempt to identify whether or not ontological knowledge expressed in text consists of meaningful clusters.",
        "With the network representation and our measure of predication strength, results indicate that predication forms strong community structures.",
        "Over-all, results point to the highly modular nature of predication, previously unreported in language.",
        "This confirms our prediction that predication comprises systematic clusters of related things and the higher modularity observed in networks weighted by predication strength implies that predication exhibits a form of selectional preference.",
        "Predi-cation's strong community structure is important because it supports the use of linguistic patterns in establishing ontological representations, which naturally form higher-level groups.",
        "Technically, our measure of predication strength, which is built on prior assessments of selectional preference, identifies the modular semantic structure of predication even when low frequency predications are included.",
        "This may be because low-frequency predications are more likely to inscribe novel, loose or figurative associations that reach between semantic clusters to inappropriately decrease the overall modularity if not down-weighted.",
        "As a result, more systematic comparison of weighted and unweighted networks, and the relative location of predication within these structures, will reveal where semantic innovation and figurative assertions are most likely to occur.",
        "The predication networks analyzed rely on a relatively tight definition of predication, one that, in other languages, may not be accessible by the copular form.",
        "Additionally, the two literal interpretations of linguistic predica-tions, equivalence or category membership, may also not be common in all languages.",
        "To the extent that parsers or taggers are available, a comparative analysis would broaden the understanding of predication in general.",
        "Given their high modularity, predication structures could be exploited further for a number of NLP tasks.",
        "The correlations between centrality and hypernym depth mean that predication networks could help construct or update categorical taxonomies.",
        "For example, these networks could help automate the construction of a hypernym taxonomy with weighted branches, potentially augmenting resources like WordNet (Ruiz-Casado et al., 2005; Miller, 1995).",
        "One could also examine the growth, combination and bifurcation of specific communities to help track ontological commitments, either over time as shifts in language structures (Gerow and Ahmad, 2012), or across genre and domain (Davies, 2010).",
        "Fur-ther, because predication encodes categorical in-formation, its community structure may also encode higher-level relations where strong inter-community links imply relationships between classes of objects.",
        "Our study examined the topographical structure of English predications in general, structure that consists, in large part, of hypernym relations.",
        "Though the relations in the examined networks are defined by copular is-a predication structure, within-community hierarchies correlated only moderately with the hypernym hierarchy in WordNet.",
        "This implies that the predications comprising our networks are either not entirely hypernymic or that WordNet is not a good baseline.",
        "Indeed, predication is a grammatical relationship that often asserts synonymy or figurative hypernymy (perhaps sometimes also metonymy) and it is not apparent from the surface structure how these semantic interpretation could be disambiguated.",
        "One reason this correlation is not higher is likely to do with the low coverage of the copular form as evidence of hypernymy (Hearst, 1992).",
        "Further work regarding the structure of predications could build on the network framework to evaluate the communities themselves.",
        "What prop-53 erties differentiate communities?",
        "Are there se-mantic, lexical or statistical properties that contribute to the formation of communities?",
        "Are there discernible differences between words that typify communities as opposed to those that bridge com-munities?",
        "Predication communities are primarily semantic in nature, implying that central nodes would typify meaningful aspects of their community.",
        "It would also be relatively easy to extend network representations to address more qualitative aspects such as coherence, word norms and word associations.",
        "Indeed, a variety of corpus-based research could employ network-based methods like those exemplified in this paper, capitalizing on graph-theory, social network analysis and statistical physics, without departing from relational structures inherent to language.",
