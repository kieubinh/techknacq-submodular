        "Abstract",
        "One research goal in Second Language Acquisition (SLA) is to formulate and test hypotheses about errors and the environments in which they are made, a process which often involves substantial effort; large amounts of data and computational visualisation techniques promise help here.",
        "In this paper we have defined a new task for finding contexts for errors that vary with the native language of the speaker that are potentially useful for SLA research.",
        "We propose four models for approaching this task, and find that one based only on error-feature co-occurrence and another based on determining maximum weight cliques in a feature association graph discover strongly distinguishing contexts, with an apparent trade-off between false positives and very specific contexts."

        "SLA researchers are interested in a wide variety of aspects of humans learning a new language (L2) different from their native one (L1): cognitive issues and developmental sequences for learners Pienemann (2005), sociocultural factors (Lantolf, 2001), and so on.",
        "One long-standing question, dating back to at least Lado (1957), is expressed by Ortega (2009) in the following way: ?What is the role played by first language in L2 develop-ment, vis-`a-vis the role of other universal development forces??",
        "An example of SLA research that looks at this question is the study of Di?ez-Bedmar and Papp (2008), comparing Chinese and Spanish learners of English with respect to the English article system (a, an, the) using corpora of essays by native and non-native speakers of English (Granger, 2011).",
        "Drawing on the 175 non-native texts, they take a particular theoretical analysis (the so-called Bickerton semantic wheel), use the simple Wordsmith tools designed to extract data for lexicographers to identify errors in a semi-automatic way, and evaluate whether Chinese and Spanish L1 speakers do behave differently via hypothesis testing (ANOVA, chi-square and z-tests, in their case).",
        "They conclude that Chinese and Spanish do have characteristic differences, with patterns of zero article and definite article use differing according to semantic context.",
        "Such studies are typically carried out on relatively small datasets, and use fairly elementary tools.",
        "Sources such as Ellis (2008) and Ortega (2009) give good overviews of such studies and of SLA research in general.",
        "A goal of this paper is to investigate a particular way in which Natural Language Processing (NLP) can usefully contribute to SLA.",
        "In terms of existing work, the subfield of Native Language Identification (NLI) has been quite active recently, which looks at predicting the L1 of writers writing in a common L2 within a classification task framework; see for example the recent NLI shared task with 29 entrants (Tetreault et al., 2013).",
        "1 From within linguistics, there has been much interest in how data-driven approaches can contribute to SLA.",
        "Granger (2011) discusses a body of work based on the the methodology of carrying out corpus-based approaches to SLA with a focus on NLP tools; Jarvis and Crossley (2012) in an edited collection present recent work by linguists who extend the corpus-based setup by using a text classification approach, looking at what feature selection might say for SLA.",
        "From within NLP, Swanson and Charniak (2013) and Swanson and Charniak (2014) take a data-driven approach to SLA investigations much in the spirit of this work.",
        "One particular approach to finding aspects of texts characteristic of their L1s that has motivated the present work is described in Yannakoudakis et al. (2012), the goal of which is to develop visualisation tools for SLA researchers.",
        "They present graphs of the relationships between errors and their contexts, such that SLA researchers can navigate through the graphs to find contexts for particular errors that can lead to hypotheses like that of Di?ez-Bedmar and Papp (2008) above.",
        "In this paper, we look at approaches to finding such hypothesis candidates automatically in the context of L1?L2 interaction by analysing the graphs used in the visualisations 1 http://sites.google.com/site/ nlisharedtask2013/ 56 of Yannakoudakis et al. (2012).",
        "Specifically, we do the following: ?",
        "We propose a new task that is more directly oriented to SLA research than NLI has been for the most part, with the goal of identifying error-related contexts that are characteristic of L1s.",
        "?",
        "We evaluate a number of models for finding such contexts, ranging from a simple baseline to treating the problem as a graph-theoretic maximum weighted clique one.",
        "?",
        "We examine the results of some of the models to see how the task and the models might contribute to SLA research.",
        "Because we draw heavily on the work of Yannakoudakis et al. (2012), we first review relevant aspects of that work in ?2; we then present our task definition and experimental setup in ?3; we give results along with a discussion in ?4; we follow with some more detail on related work in ?5; and we conclude in ?6.",
        "2 Developing Hypotheses: A Visualisation Tool The context of the Yannakoudakis et al. (2012) work is automated grading of English as a Second or Other Language (ESOL) exam scripts, as described in Briscoe et al. (2010).",
        "The automated grading takes a classification approach, using a binary discriminative learner, with useful features including lexical and part-of-speech (PoS) n-grams.",
        "The publicly available dataset on which the work was carried out consists of texts from the First Certificate in English (FCE) exam, aimed at upper-intermediate students of English across various L1s, and was presented in Yannakoudakis et al. (2011).",
        "This FCE corpus 2 consists of a subset of 1244 texts of the Cambridge Learner Corpus, 3 and is manually annotated with errors and their corrections, as well as a classification according to an error typology, as in Figure 1.",
        "Yannakoudakis et al. (2012) present their English Profile (EP) visualiser as a way to ?visually analyse as well as perform a linguistic interpretation of discriminative features that characterise learner English?, using the features of this essay classification task.",
        "They define a measure of co-occurrence of features, among themselves and with errors, as a core part of their analysis.",

        "feature?error) relationships is then presented visually.",
        "The paper then presents a case study of how the EP visualiser can be used to assist SLA researchers.",
        "The case study starts by noting that RG_JJ_NN1 is the 18th most discriminative negative feature from the essay classi-fier; then, further inspecting the graph of discriminative features, that it's linked to JJ_NN1_II and VBZ_RG.",
        "Then, looking at feature-error relations, it investigates an association with error MD (missing determiner), and presents some examples that match the features (e.g. Unix is very powerful system but there is one thing against it), along with a discussion of relationships to various L1s.",
        "It is this process of finding interesting features and linking them to particular errors and L1s that we present an approach to automating in this paper.",
        "3 Task Definition & Experimental Setup At a general level, our goal is to find which kinds of constructions (in a loose sense) centred around errors are particularly characteristic of various L1s.",
        "The specific task we define for this paper, then, is to select a set of features (in the terminology of Yannakoudakis et al. (2012))?which we refer to as the ERROR CONTEXT?that, when combined with the er-ror, show a strong association with L1, in a manner we describe below.",
        "So, for example, this may involve finding that an MD error in the context of RG_JJ_NN1, JJ_NN1_II and VBZ_RG shows a strong association with L1.",
        "We investigate a number of models for this selection process: the task then is the identification of which models produce poor error contexts (which will not rank highly in hypothesis testing) and which produce good ones (potentially worth considering by an SLA researcher).",
        "Below we discuss the data we use, the measure of association for an error and its context, the set of errors chosen, and the models for selecting context.",

        "The features used by Yannakoudakis et al. (2012) were derived from their essay classification task.",
        "As we are interested in associations with L1, we instead use features from a system submitted to the NLI shared task (Anonymous, 2013), which was applied to a dataset of Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scripts: the task and its designated corpus are described in the task overview paper (Tetreault et al., 2013).",
        "In this work we use a system trained on the TOEFL11 corpus consisting of texts written in English from speakers of 11 different L1s, with 1100 essays per L1 and balanced across topic.",
        "We only use PoS n-grams (n = 1, 2, 3) as features in this work.",
        "Note that we use the terminology of Yannakoudakis et al. (2012) here: what had their origin as features in the essay classification task are still referred to as features in the visualisation tool, although the task carried out there is not a classification one.",
        "Sim-ilarly, we refer to our PoS n-grams as features, although we are not classifying errors using these features and so are not carrying out feature selection for the typical purpose of optimising classification performance.",
        "For this, as did Yannakoudakis et al. (2012), we use the RASP parser (Briscoe et al., 2006) for tagging; the tags are consequently from the CLAWS2 tagset, 4 which are more fine-grained in terms of linguistic analysis than the more frequently used Penn Treebank tags.",
        "For our task, we then used the subset of the FCE corpus where the languages overlapped with the TOEFL11 corpus: we refer to this as FCESUB.",
        "This gives 799 scripts over 8 languages, distributed as in Table 1; a positive byproduct is that the L1s are more similar in size than the full FCE corpus.",

        "In the first sentence the model seems to find a useful pattern: the adjective that is at the centre of the error occurs in the context of a singular noun.",
        "On the other hand, the second sentence illustrates a problem: because the range of the context is the whole sentence, frequent features such as NN1 will occur a lot in other parts of the sentence that have no apparent relation to the actual error.",

        "The MD error in the last row we examine because (a more complex version of) it was the focus of the case study in Yannakoudakis et al. (2012), which from the examples of that paper looked quite convincing as an error context of relevance to SLA research.",

        "the papers from the shared task (Tetreault et al., 2013) provide a recent sample ?",
        "the emphasis on optimising classification task results, for example by using classifier ensembles (Malmasi et al., 2013), versus analysing features for relevance to other tasks has varied.",
        "Below we discuss works which directly look at how features might be related to language-learning tasks or SLA research.",
        "The seminal work of Koppel et al. (2005) that presented NLI as a classification task included, in addition to standard lexical and PoS n-gram features, errors made by the writers; these errors were automatically identified using Microsoft Word grammar checker.",
        "Kochmar (2011) used the FCE corpus for NLI, including the manually annotated errors as features, and presented an analysis of usefulness of features (including errors) with respect to L1.",
        "Wong and Dras (2011) used syntactic features on the basis of SLA theory that posits that L1 constructions may be reflected in some form of characteristic errors or patterns in L2 constructions to some extent, or through overuse or avoidance of particular constructions in L2 (Lado, 1957; Ellis, 2008); they did note distributional differences of features related to L1.",
        "Wong et al. (2012) induced topic models over function words and PoS n-grams, where some of the topics appeared to reflect L1-specific characteristics.",
        "These works, while interested in the nature of the features, do not evaluate them except via classification accuracy.",
        "Swanson and Charniak (2012) similarly explore using syntax, where they propose a richer representation 62 for L1-specific constructions through Tree Substitution Grammar (TSG).",
        "Swanson and Charniak (2013) subsequently examine both relevancy and redundancy of features through a number of metrics (including the ?",
        "2 -statistic used in this paper).",
        "They then extend a Bayesian induction model for TSG inference based on a supervised mixture of hierarchical grammars, in order to extract a filtered set of more linguistically informed features that could benefit both NLI and SLA research; an aim was to find relatively rare features that are nevertheless useful for L1 prediction.",
        "Swanson and Charniak (2014) continue on from this with a data-driven approach to inferring possible relationships between L1 and L2 structures, again using TSGs.",
        "Malmasi and Dras (2014c) also propose a method for identifying potential language transfer effects by using additional linguistic features such as adaptor grammars and grammatical dependencies to analyse differences in learner language.",
        "This body of work thus shares some similarities with the present paper, but our focus is on errors rather than on the distributional differences, and we look at error contexts that may not constitute a TSG tree or grammatical dependency.",
        "Coming from a linguistic perspective, the works in Jarvis and Crossley (2012) use Linear Discriminant Analysis for classification of texts by L1, and identify interesting features by a stepwise feature selection process in the course of classification, rather than via the measurement of their variability across L1s as here.",
        "More recently, several of these NLI techniques have been adapted and applied to languages other than En-glish, such as Arabic and Chinese (Malmasi and Dras, 2014a; Malmasi and Dras, 2014b).",
        "6 Conclusion In this paper, prompted by work on using computational visualisation techniques to help SLA researchers form hypotheses about errors and the environments in which they are made, we have defined a new task for finding interesting contexts for errors that vary with the native language of the speaker.",
        "We proposed four models, ranging from one based on simple error-feature co-occurrence statistics to one based on the maximum weighted clique on an L1-specific feature association graph; these all managed to find contexts that were more strongly associated with L1s than the raw errors alone, and produced (albeit with many false positives in the case of the simple model) some error contexts that look potentially useful for SLA.",
        "This paper is largely intended to prompt more work on applying NLP techniques to SLA more broadly.",
        "As such, there are many ways in which the work could be further developed.",
        "First, to get rid of obviously incorrect cases, the size of the area over which the feature-feature and feature-error scores are calculated could be restricted, perhaps to the relevant clause or a certain window size.",
        "Second, it may not be the case that the ANOVA F-statistic or ?",
        "2 are the best evaluation mea-sure: in medical work, for example, there is the notion of clinical significance, which takes effect size into account and is often more relevant to the practitioner than statistical significance.",
        "Similarly, the current features may not be the most meaningful.",
        "As part of this, an important step would be to bring in SLA researchers, to assess proposed error contexts and look at what evaluation measures best relate to this.",
        "The role of the present work would then be to rule out models for producing error contexts (like L1ASSOC) that produce weaker results in hypothesis testing: it would thus be complementary to the visualisation work from which it stems, guiding SLA researchers away from unproductive areas of the space of possible hypotheses.",
        "And third, the size of the corpus is (as always) an issue: as these error-annotated corpora are few and far between, a semi-supervised approach or one that in some way incorporated unannotated data would be useful, perhaps using some of the extensive recent work on error annotation.",
