        "Arabic on social media has all the properties of any language on social media that make it tough for natural language processing, plus some specific problems.",
        "These include diglossia, the use of an alternative alphabet (Roman), and code switching with foreign languages.",
        "In this paper, we present a system which can process Arabic written in Roman alphabet (?Arabizi?).",
        "It identifies whether each word is a foreign word or one of another four categories (Arabic, name, punc-tuation, sound), and transliterates Arabic words and names into the Arabic alphabet.",
        "We obtain an overall system performance of 83.8% on an unseen test set."

        "Written language used in social media shows differences from that in other written genres: the vocabulary is informal (and sometimes the syntax is as well); there are intentional deviations from standard orthography (such as repeated letters for emphasis); there are typos; writers use non-standard abbreviations; non-linguistic sounds are written (haha); punctuation is used creatively; non-linguistic signs such as emoticons often compensate for the absence of a broader communication channel in written communication (which ex-cludes, for example, prosody or visual feedback); and, most importantly for this paper, there frequently is code switching.",
        "These facts pose a well-known problem for natural language processing of social media texts, which has become an area of interest as applications such as sentiment analy-sis, information extraction, and machine translation turn to this genre.",
        "This situation is exacerbated in the case of Arabic social media.",
        "There are three principal reasons.",
        "First, the Arabic language is a collection of varieties: Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), which is used in formal settings, and different forms of Dialectal Arabic (DA), which are commonly used informally.",
        "This situation is referred to as ?diglos- sia?.",
        "MSA has a standard orthography, while the dialects do not.",
        "What is used in Arabic social media is typically DA.",
        "This means that there is no standard orthography to begin with, resulting in an even broader variation in orthographic forms found.",
        "Diglossia is seen in other linguistic communities as well, including German-speaking Switzerland, in the Czech Republic, or to a somewhat lesser extent among French speakers.",
        "Sec-ond, while both MSA and DA are commonly written in the Arabic script, DA is sometimes written in the Roman script.",
        "Arabic written in Roman is often called ?Arabizi?.",
        "It is common in other linguistic communities as well to write informal communication in the Roman alphabet rather than in the native writing system, for example, among South Asians.",
        "And third, educated speakers of Arabic are often bilingual or near-bilingual speakers of another language as well (such as English or French), and will code switch between DA and the foreign language in the same utterance (and sometimes MSA as well).",
        "As is well known, code switching is common in many linguistic commu-nities, for example among South Asians.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the issue of processing Arabizi input with code switching.",
        "There are two tasks: identification of tokens that are not DA or MSA (and should not be transliterated into Arabic script for downstream processing), and then the transliteration into Arabic script of the parts identified as DA or MSA.",
        "In this paper, we 1 use as a black box an existing component that we developed to transliterate from Arabizi to Arabic script (Al-Badrashiny et al., 2014).",
        "This paper concentrates on the task of identifying which tokens should be transliterated.",
        "A recent release of annotated data by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC, 2014c; Bies et al., 2014) has enabled novel research on this topic.",
        "The corpus provides each token with a tag, as well as a transliteration if appropriate.",
        "The tags identify foreign words, as well as Arabic words, names, punctua-tion, and sounds.",
        "Only Arabic words and names are transliterated.",
        "(Note that code switching is not distinguished from borrowing.)",
        "Emoticons, which may be isolated or part of an input token, are also identified, and converted into a conventional symbol (#).",
        "This paper presents taggers for the tags, and an end-to-end system which takes Arabizi input and produces a complex output which consists of a tag for each input token and a transliteration of Arabic words and names into the Arabic script.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first system that handles the complete task as defined by the LDC data.",
        "This paper focuses on the task of identifying foreign words (as well as the other tags), on creating a single system, and on evaluating the system as a whole.",
        "This paper makes three main contributions.",
        "First, we clearly define the computational problem of dealing with social media Arabizi, and propose a new formulation of the evaluation metric for the LDC corpus.",
        "Second, we present novel modules for the detection of foreign words as well as of emoticons, sounds, punctuation marks, and names in Arabizi.",
        "Third, we compose a single system from the various components, and evaluate the complete system.",
        "This paper is structured as follows.",
        "We start by presenting related work (Section 2), and then we present relevant linguistic facts and explain how the data is annotated (Section 3).",
        "After summarizing our system architecture (Section 4) and experimental setup (Section 5), we present our systems for tagging in Sections 6, 7 and 8.",
        "The evaluation results are presented in Section 9.",
        "2 Related Work While natural language processing for English in social media has attracted considerable attention recently (Clark and Araki, 2011; Gimpel et al., 2011; Gouws et al., 2011; Ritter et al., 2011; Der-czynski et al., 2013), there has not been much work on Arabic yet.",
        "We give a brief summary of relevant work on Arabic.",
        "Darwish et al. (2012) discuss NLP problems in retrieving Arabic microblogs (tweets).",
        "They discuss many of the same issues we do, notably the problems arising from the use of DA such as the lack of a standard orthography.",
        "However, they do not deal with DA written in the Roman alphabet (though they do discuss non-Arabic characters).",
        "There is some work on code switching between Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and dialectal Arabic (DA).",
        "Zaidan and Callison-Burch (2011) are interested in this problem at the inter-sentence level.",
        "They crawl a large dataset of MSA-DA news commentaries.",
        "They use Amazon Mechanical Turk to annotate the dataset at the sentence level.",
        "Then they use a language modeling approach to predict the class (MSA or DA) for an unseen sentence.",
        "There is other work on dialect identification, such as AIDA (Elfardy et al., 2013; Elfardy et al., 2014).",
        "In AIDA, some statistical and morphological analyses are applied to capture code switching between MSA and DA within the same sentence.",
        "Each word in the sentence is tagged to be either DA or MSA based on the context.",
        "The tagging process mainly depends on the language modeling (LM) approach, but if a word is unknown in the LM, then its tag is assigned through MADAMIRA, a morphological disambiguator Pasha et al. (2014).",
        "Lui et al. (2014) proposed a system that does language identification in multilingual documents, using a generative mixture model that is based on supervised topic modeling algorithms.",
        "This is similar to our work in terms of identifying code switching.",
        "However, our system deals with Ara-bizi, a non-standard orthography with high vari-ability, making the identification task much harder.",
        "Concerning specifically NLP for Arabizi, Darwish (2013) (published in an updated version as (Darwish, 2014)) is similar to our work in that he identifies English in Arabizi text and he also transliterates Arabic text from Arabizi to Arabic script.",
        "We compare our transliteration method to his in Al-Badrashiny et al. (2014).",
        "For identification of non-Arabic words in Arabizi, Darwish (2013) uses word and sequence-level features with CRF modeling; while we use SVMs and decision trees.",
        "Darwish (2013) identifies three tags: Ara-bic, foreign and others (such as email addresses and URLs).",
        "In contrast, we identify a bigger set: Arabic, foreign, names, sounds, punctuation 2 and emoticons.",
        "Furthermore, Darwish (2013) uses around 5K words for training his taggers and 3.5K words for testing; this is considerably smaller than our training and test sets of 113K and 32K words, respectively.",
        "Chalabi and Gerges (2012) presented a hybrid approach for Arabizi transliteration.",
        "Their work does not address the detection of English words, punctuation, emoticons, and so on.",
        "They also do not handle English when mixed with Arabizi.",
        "Voss et al. (2014) deal with exactly the problem of classifying tokens in Arabizi as Arabic or not.",
        "More specifically, they deal with Moroccan Arabic, and with both French and English, meaning they do a three-way classification.",
        "There are many differences between our work and theirs: they have noisy training data, and they have a much more balanced test set.",
        "They also only deal with foreignness, and do not address the other tags we deal with, nor do they actually discuss transliteration itself.",
        "3 Linguistic Facts and Data Annotation 3.1 Arabizi Arabizi refers to Arabic written using the Roman script (Darwish, 2013; Voss et al., 2014).",
        "Arabizi orthography is spontaneous and has no standard references, although there are numerous commonly used conventions making specific usage of the so-called Arabic numerals and punctuation in addition to Roman script letters.",
        "Arabizi is commonly used by Arabic speakers to write mostly in dialectal Arabic in social media, SMS and chat applications.",
        "Arabizi orthography decisions mainly depend on a phoneme-to-grapheme mapping between the Arabic pronunciation and the Roman script.",
        "This is largely based on the phoneme-to-grapheme mapping used in English (in Middle Eastern Arab countries) or French (in Western North African Arab countries).",
        "Since there is no standard orthography for Arabizi, it is not a simple transliteration of Arabic.",
        "For example, in Arabizi, words omit vowels far less frequently than is done when writers follow standard Arabic orthography.",
        "Fur-thermore, there are several cases of many-to-many mappings between Arabic phonemes and Roman script letters: for example, the letter ?t?",
        "is used to represent the sound of the Arabic letters \u0010 H t 1 and 1 Arabic transliteration is presented in the Habash-Soudi-Buckwalter scheme (Habash et al., 2007): (in alphabetical ?",
        "T (which itself can be also be represented using the digit ?6?).",
        "Text written in Arabizi also tends to have a large number of foreign words, that are either borrowings such as telephone, or code switching, such as love you!.",
        "Note that Arabizi often uses the source language orthography for borrowings (es- pecially recent borrowings), even if the Arabic pronunciation is somewhat modified.",
        "As a re-sult, distinguishing borrowings from code switching is, as is usually the case, hard.",
        "And, as in any language used in social media and chat, Arabizi may also include abbreviations, such as isa which means ?<?",
        "@ Z A \u0011 ?",
        "?",
        "@ ?",
        "An ?A?",
        "Allh ?God willing?",
        "and lol ?laugh out loud?.",
        "The rows marked with Arabizi in Figure 1 demonstrate some of the salient features of Ara-bizi.",
        "The constructed example in the figure is of an SMS conversation in Egyptian Arabic.",
        "3.2 Data Annotation The data set we use in this paper was created by the Linguistic Data Consortium (Bies et al., 2014; LDC, 2014a; LDC, 2014b; LDC, 2014c).",
        "We summarize below the annotation decisions.",
        "The system we present in this paper aims at predicting exactly this annotation automatically.",
        "The input text is initially segregated into Arabic script and Arabizi.",
        "Arabic script text is not modified in any way.",
        "Arabizi text undergoes two sets of annotation decisions: Arabizi word tagging and Arabizi-to-Arabic transliteration.",
        "All of the Arabizi annotations are initially done using an automatic process (Al-Badrashiny et al., 2014) and then followed by manual correction and validation.",
        "Arabizi Word Tagging Each Arabizi word receives one of the following five tags: ?",
        "Foreign All words from languages other than Arabic are tagged as Foreign if they would be kept in the same orthographic form when translated into their source language (which in our corpus is almost always English).",
        "Thus, non-Arabic words that include Arabic affixes are not tagged as Foreign.",
        "The definition of ?foreign?",

        "See the rows marked with Tag in Figure 1 for examples of these different tags.",
        "It is important to point out that the annotation of this data was intended to serve a project focusing on machine translation from dialectal Arabic into English.",
        "This goal influenced some of the annotation decisions and was part of the reason for this selection of word tags.",
        "Arabizi-to-Arabic Transliteration The second annotation task is about converting Arabizi to an Arabic-script-based orthography.",
        "Since, dialectal Arabic including Egyptian Arabic has no standard orthography in Arabic script, the annotation uses a conventionalized orthography for Dialectal Arabic called CODA (Habash et al., 2012a; Eskander et al., 2013; Zribi et al., 2014).",
        "Every word has a single orthographic representation in CODA.",
        "In the corpus we use, only words tagged as Arabic or Name are manually checked and corrected.",
        "The transliteration respects the white-space boundaries of the original Arabizi words.",
        "In cases where an Arabizi word represents a prefix or suffix that should be joined in CODA to the next or previous word, a [+] symbol is added to mark this decision.",
        "Similarly, for Arabizi words that should be split into multiple CODA words, the CODA words are written with added [-] symbol delimiting the word boundaries.",
        "The Arabic transliteration task also includes handling emoticons.",
        "Emoticons are digital icons or sequences of keyboard symbols serving to represent facial expressions or to convey the writer's emotions.",
        "Examples of emoticons are :d, :-(, O.O and ?",
        "used to represent laughing, sadness, being surprised and positive emotion, respectively.",
        "All emoticons, whether free-standing or attached to a 4 word, are replaced by a single hash symbol (#).",
        "Free-standing emoticons are tagged as Arabic.",
        "Attached emoticons are not tagged separately; the word they are attached to is tagged according to the usual rules.",
        "See Figure 1 for examples of these different decisions.",
        "Since words tagged as Foreign, Punct, or Sound are not manually transliterated in the corpus, in our performance evaluation we combine the decisions of tags and transliteration.",
        "For foreign words, punctuation and sounds, we only consider the tags for accuracy computations; in contrast, for names and Arabic words, we consider both the tag and transliteration.",
        "4 System Architecture Figure 2 represent the overall architecture of our system.",
        "We distinguish below between existing components that we use and novel extensions that we contribute in this paper.",
        "4.1 Existing Arabization System For the core component of Arabizi-to-Arabic transliteration, we use a previously published system (Al-Badrashiny et al., 2014), which converts Arabizi into Arabic text following CODA conventions (see Section 3).",
        "The existing system uses a finite state transducer trained on 8,500 Arabizi-to-Arabic transliteration pairs at the character level to obtain a large number of possible transliterations for the input Arabizi words.",
        "The generated list is then filtered using a dialectal Arabic morphological analyzer.",
        "Finally, the best choice for each input word is selected using a language model.",
        "We use this component as a black box except that we retrain it using additional training data.",
        "In Figure 2, this component is represented using a central black box.",
        "4.2 Novel Extension In this paper, we add Word Type Tagging as a new set of modules.",
        "We tag the Arabizi words into five categories as discussed above: Arabic, For-eign, Names, Sounds, and Punctuation.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates the full proposed system.",
        "First, we process the Arabizi input to do punctuation and sound tagging, along with emoticon detection.",
        "Then we run the transliteration system to produce the corresponding Arabic transliteration.",
        "The Arabizi input and Arabic output are then used together to do name tagging and foreign word tagging.",
        "The Arabic tag is assigned to all untagged words, i.e., words not tagged as Foreign, Names, Sounds, or Punctuation.",
        "The outputs from all steps are then combined to produce the final Arabic transliteration along with the tag.",
        "5 Experimental Setup 5.1 Data Sets We define the following sets of data: ?",
        "Train-S: A small size dataset that is used to train all taggers in all experiments to determine the best performing setup (feature engi-neering).",
        "?",
        "Train-L: A larger size dataset that is used to train the best performing setup.",
        "?",
        "Dev: The development set that is used to measure the system performance in all experiments ?",
        "Test: A blind set that is used to test the best system (LDC, 2014a).",
        "The training and development sets are extracted from (LDC, 2014b).",
        "Table 1 represents the tags distribution in each dataset.",
        "Almost one of every five words is not Arabic text and around one of every 10 words is foreign.",
        "5.2 Arabizi-to-Arabic Transliteration Accuracy For the Arabizi-to-Arabic transliteration system, we report on using the two training data sets with two modifications.",
        "First, we include the 8,500 word pairs from Al-Badrashiny et al. (2014), namely 2,200 Arabizi-to-Arabic script pairs from the training data used by Darwish (2013) (man- ually revised to be CODA-compliant) and about 6,300 pairs of proper names in Arabic and English from the Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzer (Buckwalter, 2004).",
        "(Since these pairs are not tagged, we do not use them to train the taggers.)",
        "Second, we exclude all the foreign tagged words from training the transliteration system since they were not manually corrected.",
        "Table 2 shows the overall transliteration accuracy of Arabic words and names only, using different training data sets and evaluating on Dev (as determined by the gold standard).",
        "The accuracy when using the original Arabizi-to-Arabic transliteration system from Al-Badrashiny et al. (2014) gives an accuracy of 68.6%.",
        "Retraining it on Train-S improves the accuracy to 76.9%.",
        "The accuracy goes up further to 79.5% when using the 5 Arabizi-to-Arabic Transliteration Arabizi Punctuation, Sound & Emoticon Detection Name Tagger Foreign Word Tagger Combiner Arabic & Tagged Arabizi Figure 2: The architecture of our complete Arabizi processing system.",
        "The \"Punctuation, Sound and Emoticon Detection\" component does labeling that is read by the \"Name\" and \"Foreign Word\" taggers, While the actual Aribizi-to-Arabic transliteration system is used as a black box.",

        "The overall transliteration accuracy of Arabic words and names on Test using the bigger training set Train-L is 83.6%.",
        "6 Tagging Punctuation, Emoticons and Sounds 6.1 Approach We start the tagging process by detecting three types of closed classes: punctuation, sounds and emoticons.",
        "Simple regular expressions perform very well at detecting their occurrence in text.",
        "The regular expressions are applied to the Arabizi in-put, word by word, after lower-casing, since both emoticons and sounds could contain either small or capital letters.",
        "Since emoticons can be composed of just concatenated punctuation marks, their detection is required before punctuation is tagged.",
        "Once de-tected, emoticons are replaced by #.",
