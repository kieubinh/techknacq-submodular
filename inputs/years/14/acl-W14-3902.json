        "In social media communication, multilingual speakers often switch between lan-guages, and, in such an environment, automatic language identification becomes both a necessary and challenging task.",
        "In this paper, we describe our work in progress on the problem of automatic language identification for the language of social media.",
        "We describe a new dataset that we are in the process of cre-ating, which contains Facebook posts and comments that exhibit code mixing between Bengali, English and Hindi.",
        "We also present some preliminary word-level language identification experiments using this dataset.",
        "Different techniques are employed, including a simple unsupervised dictionary-based approach, supervised word-level classification with and without contextual clues, and sequence labelling using Conditional Random Fields.",
        "We find that the dictionary-based approach is surpassed by supervised classification and sequence labelling, and that it is important to take contextual clues into consideration."

        "Automatic processing and understanding of Social Media Content (SMC) is currently attracting much attention from the Natural Language Processing research community.",
        "Although English is still by far the most popular language in SMC, its dominance is receding.",
        "Hong et al. (2011), for exam-ple, applied an automatic language detection algorithm to over 62 million tweets to identify the top 10 most popular languages on Twitter.",
        "They found that only half of the tweets were in English.",
        "More-over, mixing multiple languages together (code mixing) is a popular trend in social media users from language-dense areas (C?ardenas-Claros and Isharyanti, 2009; Shafie and Nayan, 2013).",
        "In a scenario where speakers switch between languages within a conversation, sentence or even word, the task of automatic language identification becomes increasingly important to facilitate further processing.",
        "Speakers whose first language uses a non-Roman alphabet write using the Roman alphabet for convenience (phonetic typing) which increases the likelihood of code mixing with a Roman-alphabet language.",
        "This can be especially observed in South-East Asia and in the Indian subcontinent.",
        "The following is a code mixing comment taken from a Facebook group of Indian university students: Original: Yaar tu to, GOD hain.",
        "tui JU te ki korchis?",
        "Hail u man!",
        "Translation: Buddy you are GOD.",
        "What are you doing in JU?",
        "Hail u man!",
        "This comment is written in three languages: En-glish, Hindi (italics), and Bengali (boldface).",
        "For Bengali and Hindi, phonetic typing has been used.",
        "We follow in the footsteps of recent work on language identification for SMC (Hughes et al., 2006; Baldwin and Lui, 2010; Bergsma et al., 2012), focusing specifically on the problem of word-level language identification for code mixing SMC.",
        "Our corpus for this task is collected from Facebook and contains instances of Bengali(BN)-English(EN)-Hindi(HI) code mixing.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we review related research in the area of code mixing and language identification; in Section 3, we describe our code mixing corpus, the data it-13 self and the annotation process; in Section 4, we list the tools and resources which we use in our language identification experiments, described in Section 5.",
        "Finally, in Section 6, we conclude and provide suggestions for future research on this topic.",
        "2 Background and Related Work The problem of language identification has been investigated for half a century (Gold, 1967) and that of computational analysis of code switching for several decades (Joshi, 1982), but there has been less work on automatic language identification for multilingual code-mixed texts.",
        "Before turning to that topic, we first briefly survey studies on the general characteristics of code mixing.",
        "Code mixing is a normal, natural product of bilingual and multilingual language use.",
        "Significant studies of the phenomenon can be found in the linguistics literature (Milroy and Muysken, 1995; Alex, 2008; Auer, 2013).",
        "These works mainly discuss the sociological and conversational necessities behind code mixing as well as its linguistic nature.",
        "Scholars distinguish between inter-sentence, intra-sentence and intra-word code mixing.",
        "Several researchers have investigated the reasons for and the types of code mixing.",
        "Initial studies on Chinese-English code mixing in Hong Kong (Li, 2000) and Macao (San, 2009) indicated that mainly linguistic motivations were triggering the code mixing in those highly bilingual societies.",
        "Hidayat (2012) showed that Facebook users tend to mainly use inter-sentential switching over intra-sentential, and report that 45% of the switching was instigated by real lexical needs, 40% was used for talking about a particular topic, and 5% for content clarification.",
        "The predominance of inter-sentential code mixing in social media text was also noted in the study by San (2009), which compared the mixing in blog posts to that in the spoken language in Macao.",
        "Dewaele (2010) claims that ?strong emotional arousal?",
        "increases the frequency of code mixing.",
        "Dey and Fung (2014) present a speech corpus of English-Hindi code mixing in student interviews and analyse the motivations for code mixing and in what grammatical contexts code mixing occurs.",
        "Turning to the work on automatic analysis of code mixing, there have been some studies on detecting code mixing in speech (Solorio and Liu, 2008a; Weiner et al., 2012).",
        "Solorio and Liu (2008b) try to predict the points inside a set of spoken Spanish-English sentences where the speakers switch between the two languages.",
        "Other studies have looked at code mixing in different types of short texts, such as information retrieval queries (Gottron and Lipka, 2010) and SMS messages (Farrugia, 2004; Rosner and Farrugia, 2007).",
        "Yamaguchi and Tanaka-Ishii (2012) perform language identification using artificial multilingual data, created by randomly sampling text segments from monolingual documents.",
        "King and Abney (2013) used weakly semi-supervised methods to perform word-level language identification.",
        "A dataset of 30 languages has been used in their work.",
        "They explore several language identification approaches, including a Naive Bayes classifier for individual word-level classification and sequence labelling with Conditional Random Fields trained with Generalized Expectation criteria (Mann and McCallum, 2008; Mann and Mc-Callum, 2010), which achieved the highest scores.",
        "Another very recent work on this topic is (Nguyen and Do?gru?oz, 2013).",
        "They report on language identification experiments performed on Turkish and Dutch forum data.",
        "Experiments have been carried out using language models, dictionaries, logistic regression classification and Conditional Random Fields.",
        "They find that language models are more robust than dictionaries and that contextual information is helpful for the task.",
        "3 Corpus Acquisition Taking into account the claim that code mixing is frequent among speakers who are multilingual and younger in age (C?ardenas-Claros and Isharyanti, 2009), we choose an Indian student community between the 20-30 year age group as our data source.",
        "India is a country with 30 spoken lan-guages, among which 22 are official.",
        "code mixing is very frequent in the Indian sub-continent because languages change within very short geo-distances and people generally have a basic knowledge of their neighboring languages.",
        "A Facebook group 1 and 11 Facebook users (known to the authors) were selected to obtain publicly available posts and comments.",
        "The Facebook graph API explorer was used for data collection.",
        "Since these Facebook users are from West Bengal, the most dominant language is Bengali 1 https://www.facebook.com/jumatrimonial 14 (Native Language), followed by English and then Hindi (National Language of India).",
        "The posts and comments in Bengali and Hindi script were discarded during data collection, resulting in 2335 posts and 9813 comments.",
        "3.1 Annotation Four annotators took part in the annotation task.",
        "Three were computer science students and the other was one of the authors.",
        "The annotators are proficient in all three languages of our corpus.",
        "A simple annotation tool was developed which enabled these annotators to identify and distinguish the different languages present in the content by tagging them.",
        "Annotators were supplied with 4 basic tags (viz. sentence, fragment, inclusion and wlcm (word-level code mixing)) to annotate different levels of code mixing.",
        "Under each tag, six attributes were provided, viz. English (en), Bengali (bn), Hindi (hi), Mixed (mixd), Universal (univ) and Undefined (undef).",
        "The attribute univ is associated with symbols, numbers, emoticons and universal expressions (e.g. hahaha, lol).",
        "The attribute undef is specified for a sentence or a word for which no language tags can be attributed or cannot be categorized as univ.",
        "In addition, annotators were instructed to annotate named entities separately.",
        "What follows are descriptions of each of the annotation tags.",
        "Sentence (sent): This tag refers to a sentence and can be used to mark inter-sentential code mixing.",
        "Annotators were instructed to identify a sentence with its base language (e.g. en, bn, hi and mixd) or with other types (e.g. univ, undef ) as the first task of annotation.",
        "Only the attribute mixd is used to refer to a sentence which contains multiple languages in the same proportion.",
        "A sentence may contain any number of inclusions, fragments and word-level code mixing.",
        "A sentence can be attributed as univ if and only if it contains symbols, numbers, emoticons, chat acronyms and no other words (Hindi, English or Bengali).",
        "A sentence can be attributed as undef if it is not a sentence marked as univ and has words/tokens that can not be categorized as Hindi, English or Bengali.",
        "Some examples of sentence-level annotations are the follow-ing: 1.",

        "The presence of this tag in a sentence conveys that intra-sentential code mixing has occurred within the sentence boundary.",
        "Identification of fragments (if present) in a sentence was the second task of annotation.",
        "A sentence (sent) with attribute mixd must contain multiple fragments (frag) with a specific language attribute.",
        "In the fourth example above, the sentence contains a Hindi fragment oye hoye ..... angreji me kahte hai ke and an English fragment I love u..",
        "!!",
        "!, hence it is considered as a mixd sentence.",
        "A fragment can have any number of inclusions and word-level code mixing.",
        "In the first example below, Jio is a popular Bengali word appearing in the English fragment Jio.. good joke, hence tagged as a Bengali inclusion.",
        "One can argue that the word Jio could be a separate Bengali inclusion (i.e. can be tagged as a Bengali inclusion outside the English fragment).",
        "But looking at the syntactic pattern and the sense expressed by the comment, the annotator kept it as a single unit.",

        "Identification of inclusions can be performed after annotating a sentence and fragment (if present in that sentence).",
        "An inclusion within a sentence or fragment also denotes intra-sentential code mixing.",

        "During cross checking of the annotated data the same error patterns were observed for multiple annotators, i.e. tagging commonly used foreign words into native language.",
        "It only demonstrates that these English words are highly assimilated in the conversational vocabulary of Bengali and Hindi.",
        "Phonetic Similarity of Spellings Due to phonetic typing some words share the same surface form across two and sometimes across three languages.",
        "As an example, to is a word in the three languages: it has occurred 1209 times as English, 715 times as Bengali and 55 times as Hindi in our data.",
        "The meaning of these words (e.g. to, bolo, die) are different in different languages.",

        "Out of the total data, 15% is set aside as a blind test set, while the rest is employed in our experiments through a 5-fold cross-validation setup.",
        "There is a substantial amount of token overlap between the cross-validation data and the test set ?",

        "For systems which do not take the context of a word into account, i.e. the dictionary-based approach (Section 5.1) and the SVM approach without contextual clues (Section 5.2), named entities and instances of word-level code mixing can be safely excluded from training.",
        "For systems which do take context into account, the CRF system (Sec- tion 5.3.1) and the SVM system with contextual clues (Section 5.3.2), these are included in train-ing, because to exclude them would result in unrealistic contexts.",

        "Our English dictionaries are those described in Section 4 (BNC, LexNormList, SemEvalTwit-ter) and the training set words.",
        "For LexNorm-List, we have no frequency information, and so we consider it as a simple word list.",
        "To predict the language of a word, dictionaries with normalized frequency were considered first (BNC, SemEvalTwitter, Training Data), if not found, word list look-up was performed.",
