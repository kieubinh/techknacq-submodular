        "The term Code-Switching (CS) denotes speech which contains more than one language.",
        "Speakers switch their language while they are talking.",
        "This phenomenon appears very often in multilingual communities, such as in India, Hong Kong or Singapore.",
        "Furthermore, it increasingly occurs in former monolingual cultures due to the strong growth of globalization.",
        "In many contexts and domains, speakers switch more often between their native language and English within their utterances than in the past.",
        "This is a challenge for speech recognition systems which are typically monolingual.",
        "While there have been promising approaches to handle Code-Switching in the field of acoustic modeling, language modeling is still a great challenge.",
        "The main reason is a shortage of training data.",
        "Whereas about 50h of training data might be sufficient for the estimation of acoustic mod-els, the transcriptions of these data are not enough to build reliable language models.",
        "In this paper, we focus on exploring and improving the language model for Code-switching speech and as a result improve the automatic speech recognition (ASR) system on Code-Switching speech.",
        "The main contribution of the paper is the extensive investigation of jointly trained maximum entropy (ME) and recurrent neural language models (RNN LMs) for Code-Switching speech.",
        "We revisit the integration of part-of-speech (POS) tags and language identifier (LID) information in recurrent neural network language models and the impact of maximum entropy on the language model performance.",
        "As follow-up to our previous work in (Adel, Vu et al., 2013), here we investigate whether a recurrent neural network alone without using ME is a suitable model for Code-Switching speech.",
        "Afterwards, to directly use the RNN LM in the decoding process of an ASR system, we convert the RNN LM into the n-gram language model using the text generation approach (Deoras et al., 2011; Adel et al., 2014); Furthermore motivated by the fact that Code-Switching is speaker dependent (Auer, 1999b; Vu et al., 2013), we first adapt the recurrent neural network language model to different Code-Switching behaviors and then generate artificial Code-Switching text data.",
        "This allows us to train an accurate n-gram model which can be used directly during decoding to improve ASR performance.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a short overview of related works.",
        "In Section 3, we describe the jointly trained maximum entropy and recurrent neural network language models and their extension for Code-Switching speech.",
        "Section 4 gives a short description of the SEAME corpus.",
        "In Section 5, we summarize the most important experiments and results.",
        "The study is concluded in Section 6 with a summary.",
        "2 Related Work This section gives a brief introduction about the related research regarding Code-Switching and re-34 current language models.",
        "In (Muysken, 2000; Poplack, 1978; Bokamba, 1989), the authors observed that code switches occur at positions in an utterance following syntactical rules of the involved languages.",
        "Code-Switching can be regarded as a speaker dependent phenomenon (Auer, 1999b; Vu et al., 2013).",
        "However, several particular Code-Switching patterns are shared across speakers (Poplack, 1980).",
        "Furthermore, part-of-speech tags might be useful features to predict Code-Switching points.",
        "The authors of (Solorio et al., 2008b; Solorio et al., 2008a) investigate several linguistic features, such as word form, LID, POS tags or the position of the word relative to the phrase for Code-Switching prediction.",
        "Their best result is obtained by combining all those features.",
        "(Chan et al., 2006) compare four different kinds of n-gram language models to predict Code-Switching.",
        "They discover that clustering all foreign words into their POS classes leads to the best performance.",
        "In (Li et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013), the authors propose to integrate the equivalence constraint into language modeling for Mandarin and English Code-Switching speech recorded in Hong Kong.",
        "In the last years, neural networks have been used for a variety of tasks, including language modeling (Mikolov et al., 2010).",
        "Recurrent neural networks are able to handle long-term contexts since the input vector does not only contain the current word but also the previous hidden layer.",
        "It is shown that these networks outperform traditional language models, such as n-grams which only contain very limited histories.",
        "In (Mikolov et al., 2011a), the network is extended by factorizing the output layer into classes to accelerate the training and testing processes.",
        "The input layer can be augmented to model features, such as POS tags (Shi et al., 2011; Adel, Vu et al., 2013).",
        "Fur-thermore, artificial text can be automatically generated using recurrent neural networks to enlarge the amount of training data (Deoras et al., 2011; Adel et al., 2014).",
        "3 Joint maximum entropy and recurrent neural networks language models for Code-Switching 3.1 Recurrent neural network language models The idea of RNN LMs is illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Vector w(t) forms the input of the recurrent neu-Figure 1: RNN language model ral network.",
        "It represents the current word using 1-of-N coding.",
        "Thus, its dimension equals the size of the vocabulary.",
        "Vector s(t) contains the state of the network - ?hidden layer?.",
        "The network is trained using back-propagation through time (BPTT), an extension of the back-propagation algorithm for recurrent neural networks.",
        "With BPTT, the error is propagated through recurrent connections back in time for a specific number of time steps t. Hence, the network is able to capture a longer history than a traditional n-gram LM.",
        "The matrices U , V and W contain the weights for the connections between the layers.",
        "These weights are learned during the training phase.",
        "To accelerate the training process, (Mikolov et al., 2011a) factorized the output layer into classes based on simple frequency binning.",
        "Every word belongs to exactly one class.",
        "Vector c(t) contains the probabilities for each class and vector w(t) provides the probabilities for each word given its class.",
        "Hence, the probability P (w i |history) is computed as shown in equation 1.",
        "P (w i |history) = P (c i |s(t))P (w i |c i , s(t)) (1) Furthermore in (Mikolov et al., 2011b), the authors proposed to jointly train the RNN with ME - RMM-ME to improve the language model and also ASR performance.",
        "The ME can be seen as a weight matrix which directly connects the input with the output layer as well as the input with the class layer.",
        "This weight matrix can be trained jointly with the recurrent neural network.",
        "?Direct- order?",
        "and ?direct connection?",
        "are the two important parameters which define the length of history and the number of the trained connections.",
        "35 3.2 Code-Switching language models To adapt RNN LMs to the Code-Switching task, (Adel, Vu et al., 2013) analyzed the SEAME corpus and observed that there are words and POS tags which might have a high potential to predict Code-Switching points.",
        "Therefore, it has been proposed to integrate the POS and LID information into the RNN LM.",
        "The idea is to factorize the output layer into classes which provide language information.",
        "By doing that, it is intended to not only predict the next word but also the next language.",
        "Hence according to equation 1, the probability of the next language is computed first and then the probability of each word given the language.",
        "In that work, four classes were used: English, Mandarin, other languages and particles.",
        "Moreover, a vector f(t) which contains the POS information is added to the input layer.",
        "This vector provides the corresponding POS of the current word.",
        "Thus, not only the current word is activated but also its features.",
        "Since the POS tags are integrated into the input layer, they are also propagated into the hidden layer and back-propagated into its history s(t).",
        "Hence, not only the previous features are stored in the history but also features from several time steps in the past.",
        "In addition to that previous work, the experiments in this paper aim to explore the source of the improvements observed in (Adel, Vu et al., 2013).",
        "We now clearly distinguish between the impacts due to the long but unordered history of the RNN and the effects of the maximum entropy model which also captures information about the most recent word and POS tag in the history.",
        "4 SEAME corpus To conduct research on Code-Switching speech we use the SEAME corpus (South East Asia Mandarin-English).",
        "It is a conversational Mandarin-English Code-Switching speech corpus recorded by (D.C. Lyu et al., 2011).",
        "Originally, it was used for the research project ?Code-Switch?",
        "which was jointly performed by Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) from 2009 until 2012.",
        "The corpus contains 63 hours of audio data which has been recorded and manually transcribed in Singapore and Malaysia.",
        "The recordings consist of spontaneously spoken interviews and conversations.",
        "The words can be divided into four language categories: English words (34.3% of all to-kens), Mandarin words (58.6%), particles (Singa- porean and Malayan discourse particles, 6.8% of all tokens) and others (other languages, 0.4% of all tokens).",
        "In total, the corpus contains 9,210 unique English and 7,471 unique Mandarin words.",
        "The Mandarin character sequences have been segmented into words manually.",
        "The language distribution shows that the corpus does not contain a clearly predominant language.",
        "Furthermore, the number of Code-Switching points is quite high: On average, there are 2.6 switches between Mandarin and English per utterance.",
        "Additionally, the duration of the monolingual segments is rather short: More than 82% of the English segments and 73% of the Mandarin segments last less than one second.",
        "The average duration of English and Mandarin segments is only 0.67 seconds and 0.81 sec-onds, respectively.",
        "This corresponds to an average length of monolingual segments of 1.8 words in English and 3.6 words in Mandarin.",
        "For the task of language modeling and speech recognition, the corpus has been divided into three disjoint sets: training, development and evaluation set.",
        "The data is assigned to the three different sets based on the following criteria: a balanced distribution of gender, speaking style, ratio of Singaporean and Malaysian speakers, ratio of the four language categories, and the duration in each set.",
        "Table 1 lists the statistics of the SEAME corpus.",

        "Modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Rosenfeld, 2000) was applied.",
        "In total, the vocabulary size is around 16k words.",

        "The first experiment aims at investigating the importance of using LID information for output layer factorization.",
        "All the results are summarized in table 2.",
        "The first RNNLM was trained with a hidden layer of 50 nodes and without using output factorization and ME.",
        "The PPLs were 250.8 and 301.1 on the development and evaluation set, respectively.",
        "We observed some gains in terms of PPL on the development set but not on the evaluation set compared to the n-gram LM.",
        "Even using ME and factorizing the output layer into four classes based on frequency binning (fb), the same trend could be noticed only the PPL on the development set was improved.",
        "Four classes were used to have a fair comparison with the output factorization with LID.",
        "However after including the LID information into the output layer, the PPLs were improved on both data sets.",
        "On top of that, using ME provides some additional gains.",
        "The results indicate that LID is a useful information source for the Code-Switching task.",
        "Furthermore, the improvements are independent of the application of ME.",
        "Model Dev Eval CS 3-gram 268.4 282.9 RNN LM 250.8 301.1 RNN-ME LM 246.6 287.9 RNN LM with fb 246.0 287.3 RNN-ME LM with fb 256.0 294.0 RNN LM with LID 241.5 274.4 RNN-ME LM with LID 237.9 269.3 Table 2: Effect of output layer factorization In the second experiment we investigated the use of POS information and the effect of the ME.",
        "The results in Table 3 show that an integration of POS without ME did not give any further improvement compared to RNN LM.",
        "The reason could lie in the fact that a RNN can capture a long history but not the information of the word order.",
        "Note that in the syntactic context, the word order is one of the most important information.",
        "However using ME allows using the POS of the previous time step to predict the next language and also the next word, the PPL was improved significantly on development and evaluation set.",
        "These results reveal that POS is a reasonable trigger event which can be used to support Code-Switching prediction.",

        "Again without applying ME, we observed that POS information is not helpful to improve the RNN LM.",
        "Using the ME provides a big gain in terms of PPL on both data sets.",

        "Therefore, different LMs were trained with varying values for these parameters.",
        "For each parameter change, the remaining parameters were fixed to the most suitable value which has been found so far.",
        "First, we varied the BPTT step from 1 to 5.",
        "The BPTT step defines the length of the history which is incorporated to update the weight matrix of the 37 RNN.",
        "The larger the BPTT step is, the longer is the history which is used for learning.",
        "Table 5 shows the perplexities on the SEAME development and evaluation sets with different BPTT steps.",
        "The results indicate that increasing BPTT might improve the PPL.",
        "The best PPL can be obtained with a BPTT step of 4.",
        "The big loss in terms of PPL by using a BPTT step of 5 indicates that too long histories might hurt the language model performance.",

        "The results reveal that the larger the direct order is, the lower is the PPL.",
        "We observed consistent PPL improvement by increasing the direct order.",
        "However, the gain seems to be saturated after a direct order of 3 or 4.",

        "The results with four different data points (50M, 100M, 150M and 200M) show that the best model can be obtained on SEAME data set by using 100M of direct connection.",

        "In order to convert the RNN into a n-gram language model, a text generation method which was proposed in (Deoras et al., 2011) can be applied.",
        "Moreover, it allows to generate more training data which might be useful to improve the data sparsity of the language modeling task for Code-Switching speech.",
        "In (Deoras et al., 2011), the authors applied the Gibb sampling method to generate artificial text based on the probability distribution provided by the RNNs.",
        "We applied that technique in (Adel et al., 2014) to generate Code-Switching data and were able to improve the PPL and ASR performance on CS speech.",
        "In addition to that previous work, we now propose to use several Code-Switching attitude dependent language models instead of the final best RNN LM.",
        "Code-Switching attitude dependent language modeling Since POS tags might have a potential to predict Code-Switch points, (Vu et al., 2013) performed an analysis of these trigger POS tags on a speaker level.",
        "The CS rate for each tag was computed for each speaker.",
        "Afterwards, we calculated the minimum, maximum and mean values as well as standard deviations.",
        "We observed that the spread between minimum and maximum values is quite high for most of the tags.",
        "It indicates that although POS information may trigger a CS event, it is rather speaker dependent.",
        "Motivated by this observation, we performed k-mean clustering of the training text into three different portions of text data which describe different Code-Switching behaviors (Vu et al., 2013).",
        "Afterwards, the LM was adapted with each text portion to obtain Code-Switching attitude dependent language models.",
        "By using these models, we could improve both PPL and ASR performance for each speaker.",
        "Artificial text generation To generate artificial text, we first adapted the best RNN-ME LM described in the previous section to three different Code-Switching attitudes.",
        "Afterwards, we generated three different text corpora based on these specific Code-Switching attitudes.",
        "Each corpus 38 contains 100M tokens.",

        "Table 8 shows the perplexity of the resulting n-gram models on the SEAME development and evaluation set.",
        "To make a comparison, we also used the unadapted best RNN-ME LM to generate two different texts, one with 300M tokens and another one with 235M tokens (Adel et al., 2014).",
        "The results show that the n-gram LMs trained with only the artificial text data can not outperform the baseline CS 3-gram.",
        "However they provide some complementary information to the baseline CS 3-gram LM.",
        "Therefore, when we interpolated them with the baseline CS 3-gram, the PPL was improved all the cases.",

        "This can be directly used during decoding to improve ASR performance on Code-Switching speech.",
        "On the SEAME development and evaluation set, we obtained an improvement of up to 18% relative in terms of PPL and 3% relative in terms of MER.",
        "7 Acknowledgment This follow-up work on exploring the impact of maximum entropy in recurrent neural network language models for Code-Switching speech was motivated by the very useful comments and suggestions of the SLSP reviewers, for which we are very grateful.",
