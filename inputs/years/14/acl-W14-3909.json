        "Code switching (CS) occurs when a multilingual speaker uses more than one language in the same conversation or discourse.",
        "Automatic idenefication of the points at which code switching occurs is important for two reasons: (1) to help sociolinguists analyze the frequency, circumstances and motivations related to code switching (Gumperz, 1982), and (2) to automatically determine which language-specific NLP models to use for analyz-ing segments of text or speech.",
        "CS is pervasive in social media due to its informal nature (Lui and Baldwin, 2014).",
        "The first workshop on computational approaches to code switching in EMNLP 2014 organized a shared task (Solorio et al., 2014) on identifying code switch-ing, providing training data of multilingual tweets with token-level language-ID annotations.",
        "See ?2 for a detailed description of the shared task.",
        "This short paper documents our submission in the shared task.",
        "We note that constructing a CS data set that is annotated at the token level requires remarkable manual effort.",
        "However, collecting raw tweets is easy and fast.",
        "We propose leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data in a unified framework; conditional random field autoencoders (Ammar et al., 2014).",
        "The CRF autoencoder framework consists of an encoding model and a reconstruction model.",
        "The encoding model is a linear-chain conditional random field (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) which generates a sequence of labels, conditional on a token sequence.",
        "Importantly, the parameters of the encoding model can be interpreted in the same way a CRF model would.",
        "This is in contrary to generative model parameters which explain both the observation sequence and the label sequence.",
        "The reconstruction model, on the other hand, independently generates the tokens conditional on the corresponding labels.",
        "Both labeled and unlabeled data can be efficiently used to fit parameters of this model, minimizing regularized log loss.",
        "See ?4.1 for more details.",
        "After modeling unlabeled token sequences, we explore two other ways of leveraging unlabeled data: word embeddings and word lists.",
        "The word embeddings we use capture monolingual distributional similarities and therefore may be indicative of a language (see ?4.2).",
        "A word list, on the other hand, is a collection of words which have been manually or automatically constructed and share some property (see ?4.3).",
        "For example, we extract the set of surface forms in monolingual corpora.",
        "In ?5, we describe the experiments and discuss results.",
        "According to the results, modeling unlabeled data using CRF autoencoders did not improve prediction accuracy.",
        "Nevertheless, more experiments need to be run before we can conclude this setting.",
        "On the positive side, word embeddings and word lists have been shown to improve CS prediction accuracy, provided they have decent coverage of tokens in the test set.",
        "2 Task Description The shared task training data consists of code?",
        "switched tweets with token-level annotations.",
        "The data is organized in four language pairs: English?Spanish (En-Es), English?Nepali (En- 80 Ne), Mandarin?English (Zh-En) and Modern Standard Arabic?Arabic dialects (MSA-ARZ).",

        "For each tweet in the data set, the user ID, tweet ID, and a list of tokens?",
        "start offset and end offset are provided.",
        "Each token is annotated with one of the following labels: lang1, lang2, ne (i.e., named entities), mixed (i.e., mixed parts of lang1 and lang2), ambiguous (i.e., cannot be identified given context), and other.",
        "Two test sets were used to evaluate each submission for the shared task in each language pair.",
        "The first test set consists of Tweets, similar to the training set.",
        "The second test set consists of token sequences from a surprise genre.",
        "Since participants were not given the test sets, we only report results on a Twitter test set (a subset of the data provided for shared task participants).",
        "Statistics of our train/test data splits are given in Table 5. lang.",

        "The second and third lines represent our train/test data split for the experiments reported in this paper.",
