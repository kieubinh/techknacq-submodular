        "Code switching is the act of changing language while speaking or writing, as often done by bilinguals (Winford, 2003).",
        "Identifying the transition points is a necessary first step before applying other linguistic algorithms, which usually target a single language.",
        "A switching point may occur between sentences, phrases, words, or even between certain morphological components.",
        "Code switching happens frequently in informal ways of com-munication, such as verbal conversations, blogs and microblogs; however, there are many examples in which languages are switched in formal settings.",
        "For example, alternating between Colloquial Egyptian Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic in modern Egyptian prose is prevalent (Rosen- baum, 2000).",
        "This shared task (Solorio et al., 2014), 1 the first of its kind, challenges participants with identifying those switching points in blogs as well as in microblog posts.",
        "Given posts with a mix of a specific pair of languages, each participating system is required to identify the language of every word.",
        "Four language-pair tracks were offered by the task organizers: Spanish-English, Nepali-English, Modern Standard Arabic and Colloquial 1 http://emnlp2014.org/workshops/ CodeSwitch/call.html Arabic, and Mandarin-English.",
        "For each language pair, a training set of Twitter 2 statuses was pro-vided, which was manually annotated with a label for every word, indicating its language.",
        "In addition to the two language labels, a few additional labels were used.",
        "Altogether there were six labels: (1) lang1?the first language; (2) lang2?the second language; (3) ne?named entity; (4) ambigu-ous -- for ambiguous words belonging to both lan-guages; (5) mixed -- for words composed of morphemes in each language; and (6) other -- for cases where it is impossible to determine the language.",
        "For most of the language pairs, the organizers supplied three different evaluation sets.",
        "The first set was composed of a set of unseen Twitter statuses, provided with no manual annotation.",
        "The other two sets contained data from a ?surprise genre?, mainly composed of blog posts.",
        "We took part only in the Spanish-English track.",
        "Both English and Spanish are written in Latin script.",
        "The Spanish alphabet contains some additional letters, such as those indicating stress (vow- els with acute accents: ?a, ?e, ?",
        "?, ?o, ?u), a u adorned with a diaeresis (?u), the additional letter ?n (e?ne), and inverted question and exclamation punctuation marks ?",
        "and ?",
        "(used at the beginning of questions and exclamatory phrases, respectively).",
        "Although social-media users are not generally consistent in their use of accents, their appearance in a word may disclose its language.",
        "By and large, algorithms for code switching have used the character-based k-mer feature, introduced by (Cavnar and Trenkle, 1994).",
        "3 Our system is an implementation of a multi-class classifier that works on the word level, considering features that we calculate using large Spanish as well as English monolingual corpora.",
        "Working with a sequential classifier, the predicted 2 http://www.twitter.com 3 We propose the term ?k-mer?",
        "for character k-grams, in contradistinction to word n-grams.",
        "139 labels of the previous words are used as features in predicting the current word.",
        "In Section 2, we describe our system and the features we use for classification.",
        "Section 3 contains the evaluation results, as published by the organizers of this shared task.",
        "We conclude with a brief discussion.",
        "2 System Description We use a supervised framework to train a classifier that predicts the label of every word in the order written.",
        "The words were originally tokenized by the organizers, preserving punctuation, emoticons, user mentions (e.g., @emnlp2014), and hashtags (e.g., #emnlp2014) as individual tokens.",
        "The informal language, as used in social media, introduces an additional challenge in predicting the language of every word.",
        "Spelling mistakes as well as grammatical errors are very common.",
        "Hence, we believe that predicting the language of a given word merely using dictionaries for the two languages is likely to be insufficient.",
        "Our classifier is trained on a learning set, as provided by the organizers, enriched with some additional features.",
        "Every word in the order written is treated as a single instance for the classifier, each including features from a limited window of preceding and successive words, enriched with the predicted label of some of the preceding words.",
        "We ran a few experiments with different window sizes, based on 10-fold cross validation, and found that the best token-level accuracy is obtained using a window of size 2 for all features, that is, two words before the focus word and two words after.",
        "The features that we use may be grouped in three main categories, as described next.",
        "2.1 Features We use three main groups of features: Word level: The specific word in focus, as well as the two previous words and the two following ones are considered as features.",
        "To reduce the sparsity, we convert words into lowercase.",
        "In ad-dition, we use a monolingual lexicon for English words that are typically used in Twitter.",
        "For this purpose, we employ a sample of the Twitter General English lexicon, released by Illocution, Inc., 4 containing the top 10K words and bigrams from a relatively large corpus of public English tweets 4 http://www.illocutioninc.com they collected over a period of time, along with frequency information.",
        "We bin the frequency rates into 5 integer values (with an additional value for words that do not exist in the lexicon), which are used as the feature value for every word in focus, and for the other four words in its window.",
        "This feature seems to be quite noisy, as some common Spanish words appear in the lexicon (e.g., de, no, a, me); on the other hand, it may capture typical English misspellings and acronyms (e.g., oomf, noww, lmao).",
        "We could not find a similar resource for Spanish, unfortunately.",
        "To help identify named entities, we created a list of English as well Spanish names of various entity types (e.g., locations, family and given names) and used it to generate an additional boolean fea-ture, indicating whether the word in focus is an entity name.",
        "The list was compiled out of all words beginning with a capital letter in relatively large monolingual corpora, one for English and another for Spanish.",
        "To avoid words that were capitalized because they occur at the beginning of a sentence, regardless of whether they are proper names, we first processed the text with a true-casing tool, provided as part of Moses (Koehn et al., 2007)?",
        "the open source implementation for phrase-based statistical machine translation.",
        "Our list contains about 146K entries.",
        "Intra-word level: Spanish, as opposed to En-glish, is a morphologically rich language, demonstrating a complicated suffix-based derivational morphology.",
        "Therefore, in order to capture repeating suffixes and prefixes that may characterize the languages, we consider as features sub-strings of 1?3 prefix and suffix characters of the word in focus and the other four words in its window.",
        "Although it is presumed that capitalization is not used consistently in social media, we consider a boolean feature indicating whether the first letter of each word in the window was capitalized in the original text or not.",
        "At this level, we use two additional features that capture the level of uncertainty of seeing the sequence of characters that form the specific word in each language.",
        "This is done by employing a 3-mer character-based language model, trained over a large corpus in each language.",
        "Then, the two language models, one for each language, are applied on the word in focus to calculate two log-probability values.",
        "These are binned into ten discrete values that are used as the features?",
        "values.",
        "We add a boolean feature, indi-140 cating which of the two models returned a lower log probability.",
        "Inter-word level: We capture the level of uncertainty of seeing specific sequences of words in each language.",
        "We used 3-gram word-level language models, trained over large corpora in each of the languages.",
        "We apply the models to the focus word, considering it to be the last in a sequence of three words (with the two previous words) and calculate log probabilities.",
        "Like before, we bin the values into ten discrete values, which are then used as the features?",
        "values.",
        "An additional boolean feature is used, indicating which of the two models returned a lower log probability.",
        "2.2 Supervised Framework We designed a sequential classifier running on top of the Weka platform (Frank et al., 2010) that is capable of processing instances sequentially, similar to YamCha (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2003).",
        "We use LibSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011), an implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995), as the underlying tech-nology, with a degree 2 polynomial kernel.",
        "Since we work on a multi-class classification problem, we take the one-versus-one approach.",
        "As mentioned above, we use features from a window of ?2 words before and after the word of interest.",
        "In addition, for every word, we consider as features the predicted labels of the two prior words.",
        "3 Evaluation Results We report on the results obtained on the unseen task evaluation sets, which were provided by the workshop organizers.",
        "5 There are three evaluation sets.",
        "The first is composed of a set of unseen Twitter statuses and the other two contain data from a ?surprise genre?.",
        "The results are available online at the time of writing only for the first and second sets.",
        "The results of the third set will be published during the upcoming workshop meeting.",
        "The training set contains 11,400 statuses, comprising 140,706 words.",
        "Table 1 shows the distribution of labels.",
        "The first evaluation set contains 3,060 tweets.",
        "However, we were asked to download the statuses directly from Twitter, and some of the statuses were missing.",
        "Therefore, we ended up with only 1,661 available statuses, corresponding to 17,723 5 http://emnlp2014.org/workshops/ CodeSwitch/results.php Label Number lang1 77,101 lang2 33,099 ne 2,918 ambiguous 344 mixed 51 other 27,194 Table 1: Label distribution in the training set.",
        "Accuracy 0.868 Recall 0.720 Precision 0.803 F1-Score 0.759 Table 2: Results for the first evaluation set, measured on tweet level.",
        "words.",
        "According to the organizers, the evaluation was performed only on the 1,626 tweets that were available for all the participating groups.",
        "Out of the 1,626, there are 1,155 monolingual tweets and 471 code-switched tweets.",
        "Table 2 shows the evaluation results for the Tel Aviv University (TAU) system on the first set, reported on the tweet level.",
        "In addition, the organizers provide evaluation results, calculated on the word level.",
        "Table 3 shows the label distribution among the words in the first evaluation set, and Table 4 shows the actual results.",
        "The overall accuracy on the word level is 0.858.",
        "The second evaluation set contains 1,103 words of a ?surprise?",
        "(unseen) genre, mainly blog posts.",
        "Out of the 49 posts, 27 are monolingual and 22 are code-switched posts.",
        "Table 5 shows the results for the surprise set, calculated on the post level.",
        "As for the first set, Table 6 shows the distribution of the labels among the words in the surprise set, and in Table 7 we present the results as measured on the word level.",
        "The overall accuracy on the surprise set is 0.941.",
        "4 Discussion We believe that we have demonstrated the potential of using sequential classification for code-switching, enriched with three types of features, some calculated using large monolingual corpora.",
        "Compared to the other participating systems as published by the workshop organizers, our system obtained encouraging results.",
        "In particular, we observe relatively good results in relating words to 141 Label Count lang1 (English) 7,040 lang2 (Spanish) 5,549 ne 464 mixed 12 ambiguous 43 other 4,311 Table 3: Label distribution in the first evaluation set.",
        "Label Recall Precision F1-Score lang1 (English) 0.900 0.830 0.864 lang2 (Spanish) 0.869 0.914 0.891 ne 0.313 0.541 0.396 mixed 0.000 1.000 0.000 ambiguous 0.023 0.200 0.042 other 0.845 0.860 0.853 Table 4: Results for the first evaluation set, measured on word level.",
        "their language; however, identifying named entities did not work as well.",
        "We plan to further investigate this issue.",
        "The results on the surprise genre are similar to that for the genre the system was trained on.",
        "However, since the surprise set is relatively small in size, we refrain from drawing conclusions about this.",
        "Trying the same code-switching techniques on other pairs of languages is part of our planned future research.",
