        "Categorical word representation has been widely used in many natural language processing (NLP) applications including statistical machine translation (SMT), where words are treated as discrete random variables.",
        "Continuous word representa-tions, on the other hand, have been applied successfully in many NLP areas (Manning et al., 2008; Collobert and Weston, 2008).",
        "However, their application to machine translation is still an open research question.",
        "Several works tried to address the question recently (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Zhang et al., 2014; Zou et al., 2013), and this work is but another step in that direction.",
        "While categorical representations do not encode any information about word identities, continuous representations embed words in a vector space, resulting in geometric arrangements that reflect information about the represented words.",
        "Such embeddings open the potential for applying information retrieval approaches where it becomes possible to define and compute similarity between different words.",
        "We focus on continuous representations whose training is influenced by the surrounding context of the token being represented.",
        "One motivation for such representations is to capture word semantics (Turney et al., 2010).",
        "This is based on the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954) which says that words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings.",
        "We make use of continuous vectors learned using simple neural networks.",
        "Neural networks have been gaining increasing attention recently, where they have been able to enhance strong SMT baselines (Devlin et al., 2014; Sundermeyer et al., 2014).",
        "While neural language and translation modeling make intermediate use of continuous representations, there have been also attempts at explicit learning of continuous representations to improve translation (Zhang et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2013).",
        "This work explores the potential of word semantics based on continuous vector representations to enhance the performance of phrase-based machine translation.",
        "We present a greedy algorithm that employs the phrase table to identify phrases in a training corpus.",
        "The phrase table serves to bilingually restrict the phrases spotted in the monolingual corpus.",
        "The algorithm is applied separately to the source and target sides of the training data, resulting in source and target corpora of phrases (instead of words).",
        "The phrase corpus is used to learn phrase vectors using the same methods that produce word vectors.",
        "The vectors are then used to provide semantic scoring of phrase pairs.",
        "We also learn word vectors and employ them to augment the phrase table with paraphrased entries.",
        "This leads to a reduction in 1 the OOV rate which translates to improved BLEU and and TER scores.",
        "We apply the two methods on the IWSLT 2013 Arabic-to-English task and show significant improvements over a strong in-domain baseline.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents a background on word and phrase vectors.",
        "The construction of the phrase corpus is discussed in Section 3, while Section 4 demonstrates how to use word and phrase vectors in the standard phrase-based SMT pipeline.",
        "Experiments are presented in Section 5, followed by an overview of the related word in Section 6, and finally Section 7 concludes the work.",
        "2 Vector Space Models One way to obtain context-based word vectors is through a neural network (Bengio et al., 2003; Schwenk, 2007).",
        "With a vocabulary size V , one-hot encoding of V -dimensional vectors is used to represent input words, effectively associating each word with a D-dimensional vector in the V ?D input weight matrix, where D is the size of the hidden layer.",
        "Similarly, one-hot encoding on the output layer associates words with vectors in the output weight matrix.",
        "Alternatively, a count-based V-dimensional word co-occurrence vector can serve as a word representation (Lund and Burgess, 1996; Lan-dauer and Dumais, 1997).",
        "Such representations are sparse and high-dimensional, which might require an additional dimensionality reduction step (e.g. using SVD).",
        "In contrast, learning word representations via neural models results directly in relatively low-dimensional, dense vectors.",
        "In this work, we follow the neural network approach to extract the feature vectors.",
        "Whether word vectors are extracted by means of a neural network or co-occurrence counts, the context surrounding a word influences its final representation by design.",
        "Such context-based representations can be used to determine semantic similarities.",
        "The construction of phrase representations, on the other hand, can be done in different ways.",
        "The compositional approach constructs the vector representation of a phrase by resorting to its constituent words (or sub-phrases) (Gao et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2010).",
        "Kalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013) obtain continuous sentence representations by applying a sequence of convolutions, starting with word representations.",
        "Another approach for phrase representation considers phrases as atomic units that can not be divided further.",
        "The representations are learned directly in this case (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Hu et al., 2014).",
        "In this work, we follow the second approach to obtain phrase vectors.",
        "To this end, we apply the same methods that yield word vectors, with the difference that phrases are used instead of words.",
        "In the case of neural word representations, a neural network that is presented with words at the input layer is presented with phrases instead.",
        "The resulting vocabulary size in this case would be the number of distinct phrases observed during training.",
        "Although learning phrase embeddings directly is amenable to data sparsity issues, it provides us with a simple means to build phrase vectors making use of tools already developed for word vec-tors, focussing the effort on preprocessing the data as will be discussed in the next section.",
        "3 Phrase Corpus When training word vectors using neural net-works, the network is presented with a corpus.",
        "To build phrase vectors, we first identify phrases in the corpus and generate a phrase corpus.",
        "The phrase corpus is similar to the original corpus except that its words are joined to make up phrases.",
        "The new corpus is then used to train the neural network.",
        "The columns of the resulting input weight matrix of the network are the phrase vectors corresponding to the phrases encountered during training.",
        "Mikolov et al. (2013b) identify phrases using a monolingual point-wise mutual information criterion with discounting.",
        "Since our end goal is to generate phrase vectors that are helpful for trans-lation, we follow a different approach: we constrain the phrases by the conventional phrase table of phrase-based machine translation.",
        "This is done by limiting the phrases identified in the corpus to high quality phrases occurring in the phrase table.",
        "The quality is determined using bilingual scores of phrase pairs.",

        "As such mapping is needed for the training of the projection matrix, we resort to the phrase table to obtain it.",
        "A source and a target phrase vectors are paired if there is a corresponding phrase pair entry in the phrase table whose score exceeds a certain threshold.",
        "Scoring is computed using Eq. 1.",

        "Noisy entries are assumed to have a probability less than a certain threshold and are not used to pair word vectors.",
        "4.3 Paraphrasing While the standard phrase table is extracted using parallel training data, we propose to extend it and infer new entries relying on continuous representations.",
        "With a similarity measure (e.g. cosine sim-ilarity) that computes the similarity between two phrases, a new phrase pair can be generated by replacing either or both of its constituent phrases by similar phrases.",
        "The new phrase is referred to as a paraphrase of the phrase it replaces.",
        "This enables a richer use of the bilingual data, as a source paraphrase can be borrowed from a sentence that is not aligned to a sentence containing the target side of the phrase pair.",
        "It also enables the use of monolingual data, as the source and target paraphrases do not have to occur in the parallel data.",
        "The cross-interaction between sentences in the parallel data and the inclusion of the monolingual data to extend the phrase table are potentially capable of reducing the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate.",
        "In order to generate a new phrase rule, we ensure that noisy rules do not contribute to the generation process, depending on the score of the phrase pair (cf. Eq. 1).",
        "High scoring entries are paraphrased as follows.",
        "To paraphrase the source side, we perform a k-nearest neighbor search over the source phrase vectors.",
        "The top-k similar entries are considered paraphrases of the given phrase.",
        "The same can be done for the target side.",
        "We assign the newly generated phrase pair the same feature values of the pair used to induce it.",
        "However, two extra phrase features are added: one measuring the similarity between the source phrase and its paraphrase, and another for the target phrase and its paraphrase.",
        "The new feature values for the original non-paraphrased entries are set to the 4 highest similarity value.",
        "We focus on a certain setting that avoids interference with original phrase rules, by extending the phrase table to cover OOVs only.",
        "That is, source-side paraphrasing is performed only if the source paraphrase does not already occur in the phrase table.",
        "This ensures that original entries are not interfered with and only OOVs are affected during translation.",
        "Reducing OOVs by extending the phrase table has the advantage of exploiting the full decoding capabilities (e.g. LM scoring), as opposed to post-decoding translation of OOVs, which would not exhibit any decoding benefits.",
        "The k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) approach is computationally prohibitive for large phrase tables and large number of vectors.",
        "This can be alleviated by resorting to approximate k-NN search (e.g. locality sensitive hashing).",
        "Note that this search is performed during training time to generate additional phrase table entries, and does not affect decoding time, except through the increase of the phrase table size.",
        "In our experiments, the training time using exact k-NN search was acceptable, therefore no search approximations were made.",
        "5 Experiments In the following we first provide an analysis of the word vectors that are later used for translation experiments.",
