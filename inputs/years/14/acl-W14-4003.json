      "heading": "1 Introduction",
      "text": [
        "There has been to date relatively little use of inversion transduction grammars (Wu, 1997) to improve the accuracy of MT evaluation metrics, despite long empirical evidence the vast majority of translation patterns between human languages can be accommodated within ITG constraints (and the observation that most current state-of-the-art SMT systems employ ITG decoders).",
        "We show that ITGs can be used to redesign the MEANT semantic frame based MT evaluation metric (Lo et al., 2012) to produce improvements in accuracy and reliability.",
        "This work is driven by the motivation that especially when considering semanticMT metrics, ITGs would be seem to be a natural basis for several reasons.",
        "To begin with, it is quite natural to think of sentences as having been generated from an abstract concept using a rewriting system: a stochastic grammar predicts how frequently any particular realization of the abstract concept will be generated.",
        "The bilingual analogy is a transduction grammar generating a pair of possible realizations of the same underlying concept.",
        "Stochastic transduction grammars predict how frequently a particular pair of realizations will be generated, and thus represent a good way to evaluate how well a pair of sentences correspond to each other.",
        "The particular class of transduction grammars known as ITGs tackle the problem that the (bi)parsing complexity for general syntax-directed transductions (Aho and Ullman, 1972) is exponential.",
        "By constraining a syntax-directed transduction grammar to allow only monotonic straight and inverted reorderings, or equivalently permitting only binary or ternary rank rules, it is possible to isolate the low end of that hierarchy into a single equivalence class of inversion transduc-tions.",
        "ITGs are guaranteed to have a two-normal form similar to context-free grammars, and can be biparsed in polynomial time and space (O ( n 6 ) time andO ( n 4 ) space).",
        "It is also possible to do approximate biparsing in O ( n 3 ) time (Saers et al., 2009).",
        "These polynomial complexities makes it feasible to estimate the parameters of an ITG using standard machine learning techniques such as expectation maximization (Wu, 1995b) .",
        "At the same time, inversion transductions have also been directly shown to be more than sufficient to account for the reordering that occur within semantic frame alternations (Addanki et al., 2012).",
        "This makes ITGs an appealing alternative for eval-22 uating the possible links between both semantic role fillers in different languages as well as the predicates, and how these parts fit together to form entire semantic frames.",
        "We believe that ITGs are not only capable of generating the desired structural correspondences between the semantic structures of two languages, but also provide meaningful constraints to prevent alignments from wandering off in the wrong direction.",
        "In this paper we show that IMEANT, a newmet-ric drawing from the strengths of both MEANT and inversion transduction grammars, is able to exploit bracketing ITGs (also known as BITGs or BTGs) which are ITGs containing only a single non-differentiated non terminal category (Wu, 1995a), so as to produce even higher correlation with human adequacy judgments than any automatic MEANT variants, or other common automatic metrics.",
        "We argue that the constraints provided by BITGs over the semantic frames and arguments of the reference and MT output sentences are essential for accurate evaluation of the phrasal similarity of the semantic role fillers.",
        "In common with the various MEANT semantic MT evaluation metrics (Lo and Wu, 2011a, 2012; Lo et al., 2012; Lo and Wu, 2013b), our proposed IMEANT metric measures the degree to which the basic semantic event structure is preserved by translation'the ?who did what to whom, for whom, when, where, how and why?",
        "(Pradhan et al., 2004)?emphasizing that a good translation is one that can successfully be understood by a human.",
        "In the other versions of MEANT, similarity between the MT output and the reference translations is computed as a modified weighted f-score over the semantic predicates and role fillers.",
        "Across a variety of language pairs and genres, it has been shown thatMEANT correlates better with human adequacy judgment than both n-gram based MT evaluation metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), NIST (Doddington, 2002), and METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), as well as edit-distance based metrics such as CDER (Leusch et al., 2006), WER (Nie?en et al., 2000), and TER (Snover et al., 2006) when evaluating MT output (Lo and Wu, 2011a, 2012; Lo et al., 2012; Lo and Wu, 2013b; Mach?",
        "?ek and Bojar, 2013).",
        "Further-more, tuning the parameters of MT systems with MEANT instead of BLEU or TER robustly improves translation adequacy across different genres and different languages (English and Chinese) (Lo et al., 2013a; Lo and Wu, 2013a; Lo et al., 2013b).",
        "This has motivated our choice of MEANT as the basis on which to experiment with deploying ITGs into semantic MT evaluation.",
        "2 Related Work 2.1 ITGs and MT evaluation Relatively little investigation into the potential benefits of ITGs is found in previous MT evaluation work.",
        "One exception is invWER, proposed by Leusch et al. (2003) and Leusch and Ney (2008).",
        "The invWER metric interprets weighted BITGs as a generalization of the Levenshtein edit distance, in which entire segments (blocks) can be inverted, as long as this is done strictly compositionally so as not to violate legal ITG biparse tree structures.",
        "The input and output languages are considered to be those of the reference and machine translations, and thus are over the same vocabulary (say,English).",
        "At the sentence level, correlation of invWER with human adequacy judgments was found to be among the best.",
        "Our current approach differs in several key respects from invWER.",
        "First,invWER operates purely at the surface level of exact token match, IMEANT mediates between segments of reference translation andMT output using lexical BITG probabilities.",
        "Secondly, there is no explicit semantic modeling in invWER.",
        "Providing they meet the BITG constraints, the biparse trees in invWER are completely unconstrained.",
        "In contrast, IMEANT employs the same explicit, strong semantic frame modeling as MEANT, on both the reference and machine translations.",
        "In IMEANT, the semantic frames always take precedence over pure BITG biases.",
        "Compared to invWER, this strongly constrains the space of biparses that IMEANT permits to be considered.",
        "2.2 MT evaluation metrics Like invWER, other common surface-form oriented metrics like BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), NIST (Doddington, 2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005; Denkowski and Lavie, 2014), CDER (Leusch et al., 2006), WER (Nie?en et al., 2000), and TER (Snover et al., 2006) do not correctly reflect the meaning similarities of the input sentence.",
        "There are in fact several large scale meta-evaluations (Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Koehn and Monz, 2006) reporting cases 23 where BLEU strongly disagrees with human judgments of translation adequacy.",
        "Such observations have generated a recent surge of work on developing MT evaluation metrics that would outperform BLEU in correlation with human adequacy judgment (HAJ).",
        "Like MEANT, the TINE automatic recall-oriented evaluation metric (Rios et al., 2011) aims to preserve basic event structure.",
        "However, its correlation with human adequacy judgment is comparable to that of BLEU and not as high as that of METEOR.",
        "Owczarzak et al. (2007a,b) improved correlation with human fluency judgments by using LFG to extend the approach of evaluating syntactic dependency structure similarity proposed by Liu and Gildea (2005), but did not achieve higher correlation with human adequacy judgments than metrics like METEOR.",
        "Another automatic metric, ULC (Gim?nez and M?rquez, 2007, 2008), incorporates several semantic similarity features and shows improved correlation with human judgement of translation quality (Callison-Burch et al., 2007; Gim?nez and M?rquez, 2007; Callison-Burch et al., 2008; Gim?nez and M?rquez, 2008) but no work has been done towards tuning an SMT system using a pure form of ULC perhaps due to its expensive run time.",
        "Likewise, SPEDE (Wang and Manning, 2012) predicts the edit sequence needed to match the machine translation to the reference translation via an integrated probabilistic FSM and probabilistic PDA model.",
        "The semantic textual similarity metric Sagan (Castillo and Estrella, 2012) is based on a complex textual entailment pipeline.",
        "These aggregated metrics require sophisticated feature extraction steps, contain many parameters that need to be tuned, and employ expensive linguistic resources such asWordNet or paraphrase tables.",
        "The expensive training, tuning and/or running time renders these metrics difficult to use in the SMT training cycle.",
        "3 IMEANT In this section we give a contrastive description of IMEANT: we first summarize the MEANT ap-proach, and then explain how IMEANT differs.",
        "3.1 Variants of MEANT MEANT and its variants (Lo et al., 2012) measure weighted f-scores over corresponding semantic frames and role fillers in the reference andmachine translations.",
        "The automatic versions of MEANT replace humans with automatic SRL and alignment algorithms.",
        "MEANT typically outperforms BLEU, NIST, METEOR, WER, CDER and TER in correlation with human adequacy judgment, and is relatively easy to port to other languages, requiring only an automatic semantic parser and a monolingual corpus of the output language, which is used to gauge lexical similarity between the semantic role fillers of the reference and translation.",

        "For MEANT, they are determined using supervised estimation via a simple grid search to optimize the correlation with human adequacy judgments (Lo andWu, 2011a).",
        "For UMEANT (Lo and Wu, 2012), they are estimated in an unsupervised manner using relative frequency of each semantic role label in the references and thus UMEANT is useful when human judgments on adequacy of the development set are unavailable.",
        "s i,pred and si,j are the lexical similarities based on a context vectormodel of the predicates and role fillers of the arguments of type j between the reference translations and the MT output.",
        "Lo et al. (2012) and Tumuluru et al. (2012) described how the lexical and phrasal similarities of the semantic role fillers are computed.",
        "A subsequent variant of the aggregation function inspired by Mihalcea et al. (2006) that normalizes phrasal similarities according to the phrase length more accurately was used in more recent work (Lo et al., 2013a; Lo and Wu, 2013a; Lo et al., 2013b).",
        "In this paper, we will assess IMEANT against the latest version of MEANT (Lo et al., 2014) which, as shown, uses f-score to aggregate individual token similarities into the composite phrasal similarities of semantic role fillers,since this has been shown to bemore accurate than the previously used aggregation functions.",
        "Recent studies (Lo et al., 2013a; Lo and Wu, 2013a; Lo et al., 2013b) show that tuning MT systems against MEANT produces more robustly adequate translations than the common practice of tuning against BLEU or TER across different data genres, such as formal newswire text, informal web forum text and informal public speech.",
        "25 In an alternative quality-estimation oriented line of research, Lo et al. (2014) describe a cross-lingual variant called XMEANT capable of evaluating translation quality without the need for expensive human reference translations, by utilizing semantic parses of the original foreign input sentence instead of a reference translation.",
        "Since XMEANT's results could have been due to either (1) more accurate evaluation of phrasal similarity via cross-lingual translation probabili-ties, or (2) better match of semantic frames without reference translations, there is no direct evi-dencewhether ITGs contribute to the improvement in MEANT's correlation with human adequacy judgment.",
        "For the sake of better understanding whether ITGs improve semantic MT evaluation, we will also assess IMEANT against cross-lingual XMEANT.",
        "3.2 The IMEANT metric Although MEANT was previously shown to produce higher correlation with human adequacy judgments compared to other automatic metrics, our error analyses suggest that it still suffers from a common weakness among metrics employing lexical similarity, namely that word/token alignments between the reference and machine translations are severely under constrained.",
        "No bijectivity or permutation restrictions are applied, even between compositional segments where this should be natural.",
        "This can cause role fillers to be aligned even when they should not be.",
        "IMEANT, in contrast, uses a bracketing inversion transduction grammar to constrain permissible token alignment patterns between aligned role filler phrases.",
        "The semantic frames above the token level also fits ITG compositional structure, consistent with the aforementioned semantic frame alternation coverage study of Addanki et al. (2012).",
        "Figure 2 illustrates how the ITG constraints are consistent with the needed permutations between semantic role fillers across the reference and machine translations for a sample sentence from our evaluation data, which as we will see leads to higher HAJ correlations than MEANT.",
        "Subject to the structural ITG constraints, IMEANT scores sentence translations in a spirit similar to the way MEANT scores them: it utilizes an aggregated score over the matched semantic role labels of the automatically aligned semantic frames and their role fillers between the reference and machine translations.",
        "Despite the structural differences, like MEANT, at the conceptual level IMEANT still aims to evaluate MT output in terms of the degree to which the translation has preserved the essential ?who did what to whom,for whom, when, where, how and why?",
        "of the foreign input sentence.",
        "Unlike MEANT, however, IMEANT aligns and scores under ITG assumptions.",
        "MEANT uses a maximum alignment algorithm to align the tokens in the role fillers between the reference and machine translations, and then scores by aggregating the lexical similarities into a phrasal similarity using an f-measure.",
        "In contrast, IMEANT aligns and scores by utilizing a length-normalized weighted BITG (Wu, 1997; Zens and Ney, 2003; Saers and Wu, 2009; Addanki et al., 2012).",

        "We note that we have also observed this pattern consistently in smaller-scale experiments?while the monolingual MEANT metric and its cross-lingual XMEANT cousin vie with each other on different data sets, IMEANT robustly and consistently produces top HAJ correlations.",
        "In both the GALE-A and GALE-B partitions, IMEANT comes within a few points of the human upper bound benchmark HAJ correlations computed using the human labeled semantic frames and alignments used in the HMEANT.",
        "Data analysis reveals two reasons that IMEANT correlates with human adequacy judgement more closely than MEANT.",
        "First, BITG constraints indeed provide more accurate phrasal similarity ag-gregation, compared to the naive bag-of-words based heuristics employed in MEANT.",
        "Similar results have been observed while trying to estimate word alignment probabilities where BITG constraints outperformed alignments from GIZA++ (Saers and Wu, 2009).",
        "Secondly, the permutation and bijectivity constraints enforced by the ITG provide better leverage to reject token alignments when they are not appropriate, compared with the maximal alignment approach which tends to be rather promiscuous.",
        "A case of this can be seen in Figure 3, which shows the result on the same example sentence as in Figure 1.",
        "Disregarding the semantic parsing errors arising from the current limitations of automatic SRL tools, the ITG tends to provide clean, sparse alignments for role fillers like the ARG1 of the resumed PRED, preferring to leave tokens like complete and range unaligned instead of aligning them anyway as MEANT's maximal alignment algorithm tends to do.",
        "Note that it is not simply a matter of lowering thresholds for accepting token alignments: Tumuluru et al. (2012) showed that the competitive linking approach (Melamed, 1996) which also generally produces sparser alignments does not work as well inMEANT, whereas the ITG appears to be selective about the token alignments in a manner that better fits the semantic structure.",
        "For contrast, Figure 4 shows a case where IMEANT appropriately accepts dense alignments.",
        "5 Conclusion We have presented IMEANT, an inversion transduction grammar based rethinking of the MEANT semantic frame based MT evaluation approach, that achieves higher correlation with human adequacy judgments of MT output quality than MEANT and its variants, as well as other common evaluation metrics.",
        "Our results improve upon previous research showing that MEANT's explicit use of semantic frames leads to state-of-the-art automatic MT evaluation.",
