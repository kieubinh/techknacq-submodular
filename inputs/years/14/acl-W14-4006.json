        "Statistical machine translation (SMT) models estimate parameters (lexical models, and distortion model) from parallel corpora.",
        "The reliability of these parameter estimates is dependent on the size of the corpora.",
        "In morphologically rich languages, this sparsity is compounded further due to lack of large parallel corpora.",
        "In this paper, we present two approaches that address the issue of sparsity in SMT models for morphologically rich languages.",
        "First, we use an Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based language model (LM) to re-rank the output of a phrase-based SMT (PB-SMT) system and second we use lexical resources such as WordNet to minimize the impact of Out-of-Vocabulary(OOV) words on MT quality.",
        "We further improve the accuracy of MT using a model combination approach.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "We first present our approach of training the baseline model and source side reordering.",
        "In Section 4, we present our experiments and results on re-ranking the MT output using RNNLM.",
        "In Section 5, we discuss our approach to increase the coverage of the model by using synset ID's from the English WordNet (EWN).",

        "3.2 English Transformation Module Hindi is a relatively free-word order language and generally tends to follow SOV (Subject-Object- Verb) order and English tends to follow SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) word order.",

        "Our main motivation is to reduce the impact of OOV words on output quality by replacing words in a source sentence with their corresponding synset IDs.",
        "However, choosing the appropriate synset ID based upon its context and morphological information is important.",
        "For sense selection, we followed the approach used by (Tammewar et al., 2013), which is also described further in this section in the context of our task.",
        "We ignored words that are regarded as Named-Entities as indicated by Stanford NER tagger, as they should not have synonyms in any case.",
        "5.1 Sense Selection Words are ambiguous, independent of their sentence context.",
        "To choose an appropriate sense according to the context for a lexical item is a challenging task typically termed as word-sense disambiguation.",
        "However, the syntactic category of a lexical item provides an initial cue for disambiguating a lexical item.",
        "Among the varied senses, we filter out the senses that are not the same POS tag as the lexical item.",
        "But words are not just ambiguous across different syntactic categories but are also ambiguous within a syntactic category.",
        "In the following, we discuss our approaches to select the sense of a lexical item best suited in a given context within a given category.",
        "Also categories were filtered so that only content words get replaced with synset IDs.",
        "5.1.1 Intra-Category Sense Selection First Sense: Among the different senses,we select the first sense listed in EWN corresponding to the POS-tag of a given lexical item.",
        "The choice is motivated by our observation that the senses of a 53 lexical item are ordered in the descending order of their frequencies of usage in the lexical resource.",
        "Merged Sense: In this approach, we merge all the senses listed in EWN corresponding to the POS-tag of the given lexical item.",
        "The motivation behind this strategy is that the senses in the EWN for a particular word-POS pair are too finely classified resulting in classification of words that may represent the same concept, are classified into different synsets.",
        "For example : travel and go can mean the same concept in a similar context but the first sense given by EWN is different for these two words.",
        "Therefore, we merge all the senses for a word into a super sense ( synset ID of first word occurred in data), which is given to all its synonyms even if it occurs in different synset IDs.",
        "5.2 Factored Model Techniques such as factored modelling (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) are quite beneficial for Translation from English to Hindi language as shown by (Ramanathan et al., 2008).",
        "When we replace words in a source sentence with the synset ID?as, we tend to lose morphological information associated with that word.",
        "We add inflections as features in a factored SMT model to minimize the impact of this replacement.",
        "We show the results of the processing steps on an example sentence below.",
        "Original Sentence : Ram is going to market to buy apples New Sentence : Ram is Synset(go.v.1) to Synset(market.n.0) to Synset(buy.v.1) Synset(apple.n.1) Sentence with synset ID: Ram E is E Synset(go.v.1) ing to E Synset(market.n.0) E to E Synset(buy.v.1) E Synset(apple.n.1) s Then English sentences were reordered to Hindi word-order using the module discussed in Section 3.",
        "Reordered Sentence: Ram E Synset(apple.n.1) s Synset(buy.v.1) E to E Synset(market.n.0) E to E Synset(go.v.1) ing is E In Table 3, the second row shows the BLEU scores for the models in which there are synset IDs for the source side.",
        "It can be seen that the factored model also shows significant improvement in the results.",
        "6 Combining MT Models Combining Machine translation (MT) systems has become an important part of Statistical MT in the past few years.",
        "There are two dominant approaches.",
        "(1) a system combination approach based on confusion networks (CN) (Rosti et al., 2007), which can work dynamically in combining the systems.",
        "(2) Combine the models by linearly interpolating and then using MERT to tune the combined system.",
        "6.1 Combination based on confusion networks We used the tool MANY (Barrault, 2010) for system combination.",
        "However, since the tool is configured to work with TERp evaluation metric, we modified it to use METEOR (Gupta et al., 2010) metric since it has been shown by (Kalyani et al., 2014), that METEOR evaluation metric is better correlated to human evaluation for morphologically rich Indian Languages.",
        "6.2 Linearly Interpolated Combination In this approach, we combined phrase-tables of the two models (Eng (sysnset) Hindi and Base-line) using linear interpolation.",
        "We combined the two models with uniform weights ?",
        "0.5 for each model, in our case.",
        "We again tuned this model with the new interpolated phrase-table using standard algorithm MERT.",
        "7 Experiments and Results As can be seen in Table 3, the model with synset information led to reduction in OOV words.",
        "Even though BLEU score decreased, but METEOR score improved for all the experiments based on using synset IDs in the source sentence, but it has been shown by (Gupta et al., 2010) that METEOR is a better evaluation metrics for morphologically rich languages.",
        "Also, when synset ID?as are used instead of words in the source language, the system makes incorrect morphological choices.",
        "Example : going and goes will be replaced by same synset ID ?aSynset(go.v.1)?a, so this has lead to loss of information in the phrase-table but METEOR catches these complexities as it considers features like stems, synonyms for its evaluation metrics and hence showed better improvements compared to BLEU metric.",

        "But the OOV words across the different models reduced as expected.",
        "The NE words remained almost the same for all the three models but OOV words from category VB,NN,ADJ decreased for Eng(synset)-Hin model and Mixture model significantly.",
        "9 Future Work In the future, we will work on using the two approaches discussed: Re-Ranking & using lexical resources to reduce sparsity together in a system.",
