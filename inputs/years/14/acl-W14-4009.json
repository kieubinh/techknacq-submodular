        "Up to now, most research efforts in statistical machine translation (SMT) research have relied on the use of a phrase-based system as suggested in (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "Recently, however, an entirely new, neural network based approach has been proposed by several research groups (Kalch- brenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014b), showing promising re-sults, both as a standalone system or as an additional component in the existing phrase-based system.",
        "In this neural network based approach, an encoder ?encodes?",
        "a variable-length input sentence into a fixed-length vector and a decoder ?decodes?",
        "a variable-length target sentence from the fixed-length encoded vector.",
        "It has been observed in (Sutskever et al., 2014), (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013) and (Cho et al., 2014a) that this neural network approach ?",
        "Research done while these authors were visiting Uni-versit?e de Montr?eal works well with short sentences (e.g., / 20 words), but has difficulty with long sentences (e.g., ' 20 words), and particularly with sentences that are longer than those used for training.",
        "Training on long sentences is difficult because few available training corpora include sufficiently many long sentences, and because the computational overhead of each update iteration in training is linearly correlated with the length of training sentences.",
        "Additionally, by the nature of encoding a variable-length sentence into a fixed-size vector representa-tion, the neural network may fail to encode all the important details.",
        "In this paper, hence, we propose to translate sentences piece-wise.",
        "We segment an input sentence into a number of short clauses that can be confidently translated by the model.",
        "We show empirically that this approach improves translation quality of long sentences, compared to using a neural network to translate a whole sentence without segmentation.",
        "2 Background: RNN Encoder?Decoder for Translation The RNN Encoder?Decoder (RNNenc) model is a recent implementation of the encoder?decoder approach, proposed independently in (Cho et al., 2014b) and in (Sutskever et al., 2014).",
        "It consists of two RNNs, acting respectively as encoder and decoder.",

        "Reprinted from (Cho et al., 2014b).",
        "From the last hidden state of the encoder, we compute a context vector c on which the decoder will be conditioned: c = g(h T x ), where g may simply be a linear affine transformation of h T x .",
        "The decoder, on the other hand, generates each target word at a time, until the end-of-sentence symbol is generated.",
        "It generates a word at a time given the context vector (from the encoder), a previous hidden state (of the decoder) and the word generated at the last step.",
        "More formally, the decoder computes at each time its hidden state by s t = f (y t?1 , s t?1 , c) .",

        "3 Automatic Segmentation and Translation One hypothesis explaining the difficulty encountered by the RNNenc model when translating long sentences is that a plain, fixed-length vector lacks the capacity to encode a long sentence.",
        "When encoding a long input sentence, the encoder may lose track of all the subtleties in the sentence.",
        "Con-sequently, the decoder has difficulties recovering the correct translation from the encoded representation.",
        "One solution would be to build a larger model with a larger representation vector to increase the capacity of the model at the price of higher computational cost.",

        "In addition to the log-probability, we also use the log-probability log p(e ij | f k ) from a reverse RNN Encoder?Decoder (translating from a target language to source language).",
        "With these two probabilities, we define the confidence score of a phrase pair (e ij , f k ) as: c(e ij , f k ) = log p(f k | e ij ) + log q(e ij | f k ) 2 |log(j ?",

        "The confidence score of a source phrase only is then defined as c ij = max k c(e ij , f k ).",
        "(3) We use an approximate beam search to search for the candidate translations f k of e ij , that maximize log-likelihood log p(f k |e ij ) (Graves et al., 2013; Boulanger-Lewandowski et al., 2013).",

        "Unless the source and target languages follow roughly the same order, such as in English to French transla-tions, a simple concatenation of translated clauses will not necessarily be grammatically correct.",
        "Despite the lack of long-distance reordering 1 in the current approach, we find nonetheless significant gains in the translation performance of neural machine translation.",
        "A mechanism to reorder the obtained clause translations is, however, an important future research question.",
        "Another issue at the heart of any purely neural machine translation is the limited model vocabulary size for both source and target languages.",
        "As shown in (Cho et al., 2014a), translation quality drops considerably with just a few unknown words present in the input sentence.",
        "Interestingly enough, the proposed segmentation approach appears to be more robust to the presence of unknown words (see Sec.",
        "5).",
        "One intuition is that the segmentation leads to multiple short clauses with less unknown words, which leads to more stable translation of each clause by the neural translation model.",
        "Finally, the proposed approach is computationally expensive as it requires scoring all the sub-phrases of an input sentence.",
        "However, the scoring process can be easily sped up by scoring phrases in parallel, since each phrase can be scored independently.",
        "Another way to speed up the segmen-tation, other than parallelization, would be to use 1 Note that, inside each clause, the words are reordered automatically when the clause is translated by the RNN Encoder?Decoder.",

        "We suspect that the existence of many unknown words make it harder for the RNNenc to extract the meaning of the sentence clearly, while this is avoided with the proposed segmentation approach as it effectively allows the RNNenc to deal with a less number of unknown words.",

        "Our investigation shows that the proposed segmentation-based translation is more robust to the presence of unknown words.",
        "However, since each segment is translated in isolation, a segmentation of an input sentence may negatively impact translation quality, especially the fluency of the translated sentence, the placement of punctuation marks and the capitalization of words.",
        "An important research direction in the future is to investigate how to improve the quality of the translation obtained by concatenating translated segments.",
