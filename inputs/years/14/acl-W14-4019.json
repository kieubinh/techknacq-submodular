      "text": [
        "Most syntactic and semantic theories agree on the argument-adjunct distinction, although they vary on the specifics of this distinction.",
        "Common to these theories is that adjunction is a central device for language recursion, as adjunction modifies initial but complete sentences by adding optional phrases; adjunction also contributes to semantic compositionality, albeit in various ways, as syntactic adjuncts may take different semantic roles.",
        "Shieber and Schabes (1990) transfer the role of adjuncts from monolingual syntax (Joshi et al., 1975) to the realm of translation equivalence using a Synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammars (STAG), and propose to view adjunction as a synchronous operation for recursive, compositional translation.",
        "STAG therefore relies substantially on what Hwa (2002) calls the Direct Correspondence Assumption, the notion that semantic or syntactic relations correspond across a bitext.",
        "We know from various works?notably by Hwa et al. (2002) for dependency relations, Arnoult and Sima?an (2012) for adjuncts, and Pad√≥ and Lapata (2009) and Wu and Fung (2009) for semantic roles?that the Direct Correspondence Assumption does not always hold.",
        "A question that has not received much attention is the degree to which the assumption of synchronous adjunction is supported in human translation data.",
        "This is crucial for the succes-ful application of linguistically-motivated STAG, but attempts at answering this question empirically are hampered by a variety of difficulties.",
        "Linguistic structures may diverge between languages (Dorr, 1994), translations may be more or less lit-eral, and annotation resources may be inaccurate, when they are available at all.",
        "Besides, automatic word alignments are known to be noisy and manual alignments are rather scarse.",
        "The work of Arnoult and Sima?an (2012) reports lower and upper bounds of one-to-one adjunct correspondence, using rather limited resources to identify French adjuncts making their results not directly applicable for measuring the stability of the synchronous adjunction assumption.",
        "In this paper we aim at redefining the translation equivalence of adjuncts in ways that allow us to report far more accurate bounds on their cross-linguistic correspondence.",
        "In particular, we are interested in measuring adjunct correspondence ro-bustly, in training data.",
        "Consider for example the sentence pair of Fig-157 ure 1.",
        "Most adjuncts in each sentence translate as adjuncts in the other sentence, but one of these translation equivalences appears to be many-to-many, because of parsing mismatches across the bitext; both parses and adjunct labellers on both sides of the bitext must be on par for adjunct translation equivalences to be established.",
        "Besides, one generally establishes translation equivalence using word alignments, which may be noisy.",
        "Another factor is that of the degree of translation equivalence in the data in general; while parallel bitexts express the same meaning, meaning may diverge locally.",
        "I think that the time A e1 A e6 has been A e7 long taken A e2 , for example , too in handling A e3 applications A e4 routine for changes of facilities A e5 along a pipeline je crois qu?il a pris A f1 de temps A f2 trop `a ?etudier des demandes A f3 de changements d?installations A f4 , A f5 courantes le long d?un pipe-line par exemple Figure 1: Example sentence pair This paper contributes the first study to measure the degree of adjunction synchronicity: we derive many-to-many pairings between adjuncts across a bitext, thus supporting a generic view of translation equivalence, where meaning can be expressed by distinct entities and redistributed freely in translation; practically, this also allows us to capture equivalence in spite of mismatched parses.",
        "We abstract away from word alignments to a certain degree, as we directly pair adjuncts across a bitext, but we still use word alignments?",
        "namely the overlap of adjunct projections with target adjuncts?to decide on these pairings.",
        "We further distinguish between adjunct pairings that are bijective through the word alignment, and other pairings, where the translation equivalence does not exactly agree with the word alignment; we qualify these pairings as weakly equivalent.",
        "Under this new view of adjunct translation equivalence, we perform measures in French-English data.",
        "We show that adjunction is preserved in 40% to 50% of the cases with automatically labelled adjuncts, with differences between data sets, word aligners and sentence length; about 25% more adjuncts form weakly translation-equivalent pairings.",
        "With gold adjunct annota-tions, the proportion of translation-equivalent adjuncts increases to 70%.",
        "These results show that adjunct labelling accuracy on both sides of the data is crucial for adjunct alignment, while suggesting that applications that exploit adjunction can gain from decreasing their dependence on word alignments and idealized experimental conditions , and identifying favorable contexts for adjunct preservation.",
        "2 Alignment-based role pairing How can one find translation-equivalent adjuncts using word alignments, without being too constrained by the latter?",
        "Obviously, adjunct pairs that are consistent with the word alignments are translation equivalent, but we also want to be able to identify translation-equivalent adjuncts that are not exactly aligned to each other, and also to accept many-to-many pairings; not only to get linguistically justified discontinuous pairs, as with the French double negation particle, but also for robustness with regard to dissimilar attachments in the French and English parses.",

        "The weakly-equivalent types we-nm and we-11 regroup both divergent and equivalent pairings: the adjuncts of Examples (5) and (8) are aligned by our method to adjuncts that are not their translation equivalent, the adjunct in Example (6) cannot be aligned to its equivalent because of a parsing error, and the equivalences in Examples (7) and (9) cannot be identified because of a word-alignment error.",

        "All data sets show a dramatic increase of the proportion of adjuncts involved in many-to-many, and to a lesser extent one-to-one weakly equivalent translations.",
        "This increase is accompanied by a decrease of all other adjunct-pairing types (un- aligned adjuncts excepted), and is likely to result from increased word-alignment and parsing errors with sentence length.",
        "A rather surprising result is the high proportion of divergent adjunct translations in the shorter sentences of the Hansards training set; we find the same phenomenon with the GIZA++ alignment.",
        "We attribute this effect to the Hansards set having less literal translations than the other sets.",
        "That we see this effect mostly in shorter sentences may result from translation mismatches being mostly local.",
        "As sentence length increases however, word and adjunct alignment errors are also likely to link more unrelated adjuncts, resulting in a drop of divergent adjuncts.",
        "4.5 Simplifying alignments We perform a simple experiment to test the effect of word-alignment simplification of adjunct translation equivalence.",
        "For this we remove alignment links between function words (as defined in section 3) on both sides of the data, and we realign adjuncts using these simplified alignments.",
        "Table 9 shows that this simplification (column ?-fw?)",
        "slightly decreases the proportion of weakly equivalent pairings with regard to the standard alignment (?std?",
        "), mostly to the benefit of translation-equivalent pairings.",
        "This suggests that further gains may be obtained with better alignments.",

        "They identify complements using (Collins, 2003)'s rules, and regard all other non-head constituents as adjuncts.",
        "Their model is able to generalize to unseen adjunction patterns, and to beat a string-to-tree baseline in an Arabic-English translation task.",
        "Arnoult and Sima?an (2012) exploit adjunct optionality to generate new training data for a phrase-based model, by removing phrase pairs with an English adjunct from the training data.",
        "They identify adjuncts using syntactic heuristics in phrase-structure parses.",
        "They found that few of the generated phrase pairs were actually used at decoding, leading to marginal improvement over the baseline in a French-English task.",
        "They also report 163 figures of role preservation for different categories of adjuncts, with lower bounds between 29% and 65% and upper bounds between 61% and 78%, in automatically aligned Europarl data.",
        "The upper bounds are limited by discontinuous adjunct pro-jections, while the estimation of lower bounds is limited by the lack of adjunct-identification means for French.",
        "There has been a growing body of work on exploiting semantic annotations for SMT.",
        "In many cases, predicate-argument structures are used to provide source-side contextual information for lexical selection and/or reordering (Xiong et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013), without requiring cross-linguistic correspondence.",
        "When correspondence between semantic roles is required, predicates are commonly aligned first.",
        "For instance, Lo et al. (2012) use a maximum-weighted bipartite matching algorithm to align predicates with a lexical-similarity measure to evaluate semantic-role correspondence.",
        "Pad√≥ and Lapata (2009) use the same algorithm with a similarity measure based on constituent overlap to project semantic roles from English to German.",
        "6 Conclusion In this paper we presented the first study of translation equivalence of adjuncts on a variety of French-English parallel corpora and word alignments.",
        "We use a method based on overlap to derive many-to-many adjunct pairings, that are interpretable in terms of translation equivalence.",
        "We found through measurements in French-English data sets that 40% to 50% of adjuncts?",
        "depending on the data?are bijectively aligned across a bitext, whereas about 25% more adjuncts align to adjuncts, albeit not bijectively.",
        "We estimate that a third of these weakly equivalent links represent true, adjunct translation equivalences.",
        "With manually identified adjuncts, we found that about 70% have adjunct translation-equivalents in automatically aligned data.",
        "These are fairly low results if one considers that French and English are relatively close syntactically.",
        "So while they show that adjunct labelling accuracy on both sides of the data is crucial for adjunct alignment, and that applications that exploit adjunction can gain from decreasing their dependence on word alignments and idealized experimental conditions, they call for better understanding of the factors behind translation divergence.",
        "In fact, as a remaining quarter of adjuncts have divergent translations, it would be interesting to determine, for instance, the degree to which divergence is caused by lexical conflation, or reflects non-literal translations.",
