        "Mushrooming as a scalable lifelong learning paradigm, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have enjoyed significant limelight in recent years, both in industry and academia (Hag- gard et al., 2013).",
        "The euphoria is about the transformative potential of MOOCs to revolutionize online education (North et al., 2014), by connecting and fostering interaction among millions of learners who otherwise would never have met and providing autonomy to these learners to grapple with the course instruction at their own pace of understanding.",
        "However, despite this expediency, there is also considerable skepticism in the learning analytics research community about MOOC productiveness (Nawrot and Antoine, 2014), primarily because of unsatisfactory learning outcomes that plague these educational platforms and induce a funnel of participation (Clow, 2013).",
        "With a ?one size fits all?",
        "approach that MOOCs follow, scaled up class sizes and lack of face to face interaction coupled with such high student teacher ratios (Guo and Katharina, 2014), stu-dents?",
        "motivation to follow the course oscillates (Davis et al., 2014).",
        "This is comprehensibly reflected in escalating attrition rates in MOOCs, ever since they have started maturing (Belanger and Thornton, 2013; Schmidt and Zach, 2013; Yang et al., 2013).",
        "Because it is not feasible for MOOC instructors to manually provide individualized attention that caters to different backgrounds, diverse skill levels, learning goals and preferences of stu-dents, there is an increasing need to make directed efforts towards automatically providing better personalized content in e-learning (Sinha et al., 2013; Lie et al., 2014; Sinha, 2014a).",
        "The provision of guidance with regard to the organization of the study and regulation of learning is a domain that also needs to be addressed.",
        "A prerequisite for such an undertaking is that we, as MOOC researchers, understand how diverse ecologies of participation develop as students interact with the course material (Fischer, 2011), and how learners distribute their attention with multiple forms of computer mediated inputs in MOOCs.",
        "Learning in a MOOC requires that students apply self regulation.",
        "While substantial research has been done on studying MOOC discussion forums (Ramesh et al., 2013; Brinton et al., 2013; Anderson et al., 2014; Sinha, 2014b), grading strategies for assignments (Tillmann et al., 2013; Kulkarni et al., 2014) and deployment of reputation systems (Coetzee et al., 2014), inner workings of students?",
        "interaction while watching MOOC video lectures have been much less focused upon.",
        "Given that roughly 5% (Huang et al., 2014) of students actually participate in MOOC discussion forums, it would be legitimate to ask whether choosing video lectures as units of analysis would be more insightful.",
        "After 330,000 reg-3 istrations in MOOC courses at EPFL in 2013, our experience reflects that out of the 100% students who register, 75% show up: 50% of them primarily watch video lectures and the rest 25% additionally work out homeworks and assignments.",
        "Thus, majority of students have video lecture viewing as their primary MOOC activity.",
        "Video lectures form a primary and an extremely crucial part of MOOC instruction design.",
        "They serve as gateways to draw students into the course.",
        "Concept discussions, demos and tutorials that are held within these short video lectures, not only guide learners to complete course assignments, but also encourage them to discuss the taught syllabus on MOOC discussion forums.",
        "Specific to the context of video lectures, prior work has cut teeth on a)how video production style (slides, code, classroom, khan academy style etc) relates to students?",
        "engagement (Guo et al., 2014), b)what features of the video lecture and instruction de-livery, such as slide transitions (change in visual content), instructor changing topic (topic model-ing and ngram analysis) or variations in instruc-tor's acoustic stream (volume, pitch, speaking rate), lead to peaks in viewership activity (Kim et al., 2014b).",
        "There has been increasing focus on unveiling numerous facets of complexity of raw click-level interactions resulting from student activities within individual MOOC videos (Kim et al., 2014a; Sinha et al., 2014).",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge, we present the first study that describes usage of such detailed clickstream information to form cognitive video watching states that summarize student clickstream.",
        "Instead of using summative features that express student engagement, we leverage recurring click behaviors of students interacting with MOOC video lectures, to construct their video watching profile.",
        "Based on these richly logged interactions of stu-dents, we develop computational methods that answer critical questions such as a)how long will students grapple with the course material and what will their engagement trajectory look like, b)what future click interactions will characterize their be-havior, c)whether students are ultimately going to survive through the end of the video and course.",
        "As an effort to improve the second generation of MOOC offerings, we perform a hierarchical three level clickstream analysis, rooted in foundations of cognitive psychology.",
        "Incidentally, we explore at a micro level whether, and how, cognitive mind states govern the formation and occurrence of micro level click patterns.",
        "Towards this end, we also develop a quantitative information processing index and monitor its variations among different student partitions that we define for the MOOC.",
        "Such an operationalization can help course instructors to reason how students?",
        "navigational style reflects cognitive resource allocation for meaning processing and retention of concepts taught in the MOOC.",
        "Our metric aids MOOC designers in identifying which part of the videos might require editing.",
        "The goal is to develop an explanatory techno-cognitive model which shows that a set of metrics derived from low-level behaviors are meaningful, and can in turn be used to make effective predictions on high-level behaviors intuitively.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, we describe our study context in the next section.",
        "In section 3, we motivate our three level hierarchical MOOC video clickstream analysis (operations, actions, information processing activities), describing relevant related work along the way, along with the technical approach followed.",
        "In section 4, we validate our developed methodology by setting up certain machine learning experiments, specifically engagement prediction, next click state prediction, in-video and complete course dropout prediction.",
        "Implications for future work and conclusion is presented in section 5.",
        "2 Study Context The data for our current study comes from an introductory programming MOOC ?Functional Programming in Scala?",
        "that was offered on the Coursera MOOC platform in 2012.",
        "This MOOC comprises 48 video lectures (10 Gb of JSON data), which has been parsed and preprocessed into a convenient format for experimentation.",
        "In these interaction logs, every click of students on the MOOC video player is registered (play, pause, seek forward, seek backward, scroll forward, scroll backward, ratechange).",
        "We have information about the rate at which the video lecture is played, total time spent on playing the video and time spent on/in-between various click events such as play, pause, seek etc.",
        "In total, 65969 students registered for the course, and 36536 of them had 762137 logged video interaction sessions containing the aforementioned types of click events.",
        "If a video is played till the end, then an automatic video-end pause is generated.",
        "Otherwise, 4 the Coursera platform unfortunately does not log whether or not a student has left the video in the middle, leaving the true video engagement time unknown.",
        "To avoid biased data, we only include video sessions containing video-end pauses.",
        "This has yielded a dataset of 222021 video sessions from 21952 students for our analysis in this paper.",
        "3 Operationalizing the Clickstream 3.1 Level 1 (Operations) From our raw clickstream data, we construct a detailed encoding of students?",
        "clicks in the following 8 categories: Play (Pl), Pause (Pa), SeekFw (Sf), SeekBw (Sb), ScrollFw (SSf), ScrollBw (SSb), RatechangeFast (Rf), RatechangeSlow (Rs).",
        "When two seeks happen within a small time range (< 1 sec), we group these seek events into a scroll.",
        "Additionally, to encode ?Rf?",
        "and ?Rs?, we look for the playrate of the click event that occurs just before the ?Ratechange?",
        "click and compare it with students?",
        "currently changed playrate, to determine whether he has sped up/slowed down his playing speed.",
        "The reason behind encoding click-streams to such specific categories, accommodating scrolling behavior and clicks representative of increase and decrease in video playing speed, is to experimentally analyze and understand the impact of such a granularity on our experiments, which are designed with an objective to capture the motley of differently motivated behavioral watching style in students.",
        "As a next step, we concatenate these click events for every student, for every video lecture watched.",
        "Thus, the output from level 1 is this string of symbols that characterizes the sequence of clickstream events (video watching state sequence).",
        "For e.g: PlPaSfSfPaSbPa.., PlSSb-PaRsRsPl.. 3.2 Level 2 (Behavioral Actions) Existing literature on web usage mining says that representing clicks using higher level categories, instead of raw clicks, better exposes the browsing pattern of users.",
        "This might be because high level categories have better noise tolerance than naive clickstream logs.",
        "The results obtained from grouping clickstream sequences at per click resolution are often difficult to interpret, as such a fine resolution leads to a wide variety of se-quences, many of which are semantically equivalent.",
        "Therefore, to get more insights into student behavior in MOOCs, we group clicks encoded at very fine granularity into meaningful behavioral categories.",
        "Doing this also reduces sequence length which is easily interpretable.",
        "There is some existing literature (Banerjee and Ghosh, 2000; Wang et al., 2013), that just considers click as a binary event (yes/no) and discusses formation of concept based categories based on the area/sub area of the stimulus where the click was made.",
        "To summarize a students?",
        "clickstream, we obtain n-grams with maximum frequency from the clickstream sequence (a contiguous sequence of ?n?",
        "click actions).",
        "Such a simple n-gram representation convincingly captures the most frequently occurring click actions that students make in conjunction with each other (n=4 was empirically determined as a good limit on clickstream subsequence overspecificity).",
        "Then, we construct seven semantically meaningful behavioral categories using these discovered n-grams, selecting representative click groups that occur within top ?k?",
        "most frequent n-grams (k=100).",
        "Each behavioral category acts like a latent variable, which is difficult to measure from data directly.",

        "Weight(P, A/B) represents the similarity of the pattern P w.r.t clickstream sequence A or B. In an attempt to quantify the importance of each of the above behavioral actions in characterizing the clickstream, we adopt a fuzzy string matching approach.",
        "Using this approach, we assign a weight to each of the grouped behavioral patterns for a given students?",
        "video watching state sequence (based on similarity of click groups present in each behavioral category, with the full clickstream sequence).",
        "The fuzzy string method (Van, 2014) is justified because it caters to the noise that might be present in raw clickstream logs of stu-dents, in six different ways, as mentioned in Table 1.",
        "After identifying these cases and meticulous experimental evaluation, we apply the following distance metrics and tuning parameters: Cosine similarity metric between the vector of counts of n-gram (n=4) occurrences for Cases 1 and 2, Levenshtein similarity metric for Cases 3 (weight for deletion=0, weight for insertion and substitu-tion=1), 4, 5, 6 (weight for deletion=0.1, weight for insertion, substitution=1).",
        "As a next step, all subcategories of click groups that lie within each behavioral category are aggregated by summing up the individual fuzzy string similarity weights that are obtained with respect to every students?",
        "clickstream sequence.",
        "Then, we perform a discretization of these summed up weights, for each behavioral category, by equal frequency (High/Low).",
        "The concern of adding up two distance metrics that do not lie in the same range, is thus alleviated, because the dichotomization automatically places highly negative values in the ?Low?",
        "category and positive values closer to 0 in the ?High?",
        "category.",
        "The result is a clickstream vector for each video viewing session of the student, where every element of the vector tells us about the weight (importance) of a behavioral category for characterizing the clickstream.",
        "Thus, the output from level 2 is such a summarized clickstream vector.",
        "For e.g: (Skipping=High, Fast Watching=High, Checkback Reference=Low, Re-watch=Low, ....).",
        "3.3 Level 3 (Information Processing) Watching MOOC videos is an interaction between the student and the medium, and therefore the conceptualization of higher-order thinking eventually leading to knowledge acquisition (Chi, 2000), is under control of both the a)student (who decides what video segment to watch, when and in what order to watch, how hard an effort be made to try and understand a specific video segment) and, b)medium/video lecture (the content or features of which decides what capacity allocation is required by the student to fully process the information contained).",
        "Research has consistently found that the level of cognitive engagement is an important aspect of student participation (Carini et al., 2006).",
        "This cognitive processing is influenced by the appetitive (approach) and aversive (avoidance) motivational systems of a student, which activate in response to motivationally relevant stimuli in the environment (Cacioppo and Wendi, 1999).",
        "For ex-ample, in the context of MOOCs, the appetitive system's goal is in-depth exploration and information intake, while the aversive system primarily serves as a motivator for not attending to certain MOOC video segments.",
        "Thus, click behaviors representative of appetitive motivational system are rewatch/clear concept/slow watching, while click behaviors representative of aversive motiva-6 Figure 1: Relating students?",
        "information processing to click behaviors exhibited in the MOOC, based on video lecture perception tional system are skipping/fast watching.",
        "In this work, we try to construct students?",
        "information processing index, based on the ?Limited Capacity Information Processing Approach?",
        "(Basil, 1994; Lang et al., 1996; Lang, 2000), which asserts that people independently allocate limited amount of cognitive resources to tasks from a shared pool.",
        "Figure 1 depicts this idea.",
        "We must acknowledge the fact that video watching in MOOCs requires students to recall facts that they already know (specific chunks of declarative knowledge (Anderson, 2014).",
        "This helps them to build a mental representation of the information presented in a MOOC video lecture segment, follow and understand the concept being currently taught.",
        "However, it must be noted that depending on the a)expertise level, which decides how available the past knowledge is and how hard is it to retrieve the previously known facts, b)perception of video lecture as difficult or simple to under-stand, c)motivation to learn or just have a look at the video lecture to seek specific outcomes, cognitive resource allocation would vary among these time sensitive subprocesses in stage 1 and 2 of the pipeline (depicted in Figure 1).",
        "This in turn, would be reflected by the underlying non linear navigational patterns that students have, specifically the nature of clicks which they make to adjust the speed of information processing (by pausing, seeking forward/backward, ratechange clicks), as responses to the stimuli.",
        "Consider an example of students who watch the MOOC lecture, primarily because of reasons such as gaining familiarity with the topic.",
        "Such students would purposely not allocate their processing resources to ?memory?",
        "part of the information processing pipeline (encode, store, retrieve).",
        "Ad-ditionally, they will decode and process minimal information that is required to follow the story.",
        "On the contrary, students who watch the MOOC lecture, with the aim of scoring well in post-tests (MOOC quizzes and assignments), would allocate high cognitive processing to understand, learn and retain information from the lecture.",
        "Thus, such students would process information more fully and thoroughly, despite a possibility of cognitive overload.",
        "In order to relate our behavioral actions constructed from the raw clickstream with this rich and informative stream of literature, we create a taxonomy of behavioral actions exhibited in the clickstream to construct a quantitative ?Informa- tion Processing Index (IPI)?.",
        "Figure 2 reflects the proposed hierarchy of information processing from high to low using linear weight assignments.",
        "We omit the line of reasoning that goes behind defining the precise position of each behavioral action in this hierarchy due to lack of space.",
        "How-ever, the details can be found in (Sinha, 2014c).",
        "Negative weights are necessary to distinguish between ?high?",
        "and ?low?",
        "weights for each behavioral action.",
        "For example, if skipping=high is weighted -3, skipping=low will be weighted +3 on the information processing index.",
        "Students?",
        "infor-7 mation processing index is defined as follows: Information Processing Index (IPI) = (?1) j 7 ?",
        "i=1 WeightAssign(Behavioral Action i), j=1,2 depending on whether the behavioral action is weighted low or high.",
        "Figure 2: Linear weight assignments for behavioral clickstream actions, according to the information processing hierarchy developed One of the focal utilities of developing such a quantitative index is that meaningful intervention could be provided in real time to students, as they steadily build up their video watching profile while interacting with MOOC video lectures.",
        "Viewing throught the lens of the Goldilocks principle (Kidd et al., 2012), our metric can potentially help instructors in understanding and differentiating between students looking away from the MOOC visual sequence, because of too simple or too complex representation.",
        "Adaptive presentation of instructional materials is another learning science application where leveraging our metric would be beneficial.",
        "Specifically, when IPI > 0, it can be inferred that high information processing is being done by students.",
        "Therefore MOOC instructors need to check for coherency in pace of instruction delivery and students?",
        "understanding.",
        "This might also hint towards redesigning specific video lecture segments and simplifying them so that they become easier to follow.",
        "On the contrary, when IPI < 0, low information processing is being done by students.",
        "Therefore MOOC instructors need to help students better engage with the course, by providing them additional interesting read-ing/assignment material, or fixing video lecture content such that it captures students?",
        "attention.",
        "The neutral case of IPI = 0 occurs when students?",
        "locally exhibited high and low information processing needs in their evolving clickstream sequence counterbalance each other.",
        "So, interventions need to made depending on the video lecture segment, where IPI was >0 or <0.",

        "Thus, it is meaningful to quantify students?",

        "For example, if a student plays 700 secs out of a 1000 sec video, pauses 2 times for 100 secs each, at an average play rate of 1.5, he effectively engages with the video for (700+200)?1.5=1350 secs.",
