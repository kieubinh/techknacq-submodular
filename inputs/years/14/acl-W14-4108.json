        "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have attracted millions of students, and yet, their pedagogy is often less elaborated than the state of the art in learning sciences.",
        "Scaling up learning activities in MOOCs can be viewed as a sacrifice of pedagogical support, made acceptable by the benefits of giving broad access to education for a marginal increase of costs.",
        "Even with students volunteering as teaching assistants in MOOCs, it is not possible to provide at a distance the same support quality in a class of ten thousand as in a class of a hundred, because of the difficulty to collect and analyse data from such a high number of learners.",
        "This means that MOOC instructors need to rely on rich computational methods that capture the formalism of how learners progress through the course and what traits of decreasing engagement with the course are predictive of attrition over time.",
        "The interpretation of the state of the students can then either be performed by the students themselves, by a human coach or by an automated agent that can deliver recommendations to the students.",
        "In this work, we model the sequence of learning activities in the MOOC as a graph with specific properties.",
        "Describing the participants actions sequence as a graph may initially sound as a futile complexity since most MOOCs are built as a simple linear sequence of activities (watch video, do assignments, read forums).",
        "However, when looking at the activity in more detail, some sequences are richer and justify a more powerful descriptive modeling.",
        "The descriptive power of the graph model is to capture the underlying structure of the learning activity.",
        "The hypothesis is that formalizing the workflow of such heterogeneous behavior in MOOCs, is one solution to be able to a) scale up learning activities that may initially appear as non scalable, b) help instructors reason out how educational scenarios concretely unfold with time, such as what happened during the course (at what times were learners active and performing well, lost, disoriented or trapped) and what needs to be repaired.",
        "2 Related Work In this section we outline perspectives on student attrition that have been explored so far in the literature on MOOCs.",
        "Much of this work successfully leverages effective feature engineering and advanced statistical methods.",
        "However, the biggest limitation of most of these emerging works is that they focus solely on discussion forum behavior or video lecture activity, but do not fuse and take them into account.",
        "Some of these works 42 have grown out of research on predicting academic progress of students and identifying students those who are at dropout risk (Kotsiantis et al., 2003; Dekker et al., 2009; Pal, 2012; M?arquez-Vera et al., 2013; Manhaes et al., 2014).",
        "Some prior research has focused on deriving social positioning metrics within discussion forums to understand influencing factors that lead to differently motivated behaviors of students.",
        "For ex-ample, (Yang et al., 2013; Ros?e et al., 2014) used aggregate post-reply discussion forum graph per week, with an aim to investigate posting behavior and collaborative aspects of participation through operationalizations of social positioning.",
        "How-ever, we work at a much finer granularity in the current study and our focus is on individual student modeling instead.",
        "We capture not only forum participation trajectory, but also video lecture viewing activity of every student in their participation week.",
        "Modeling the combined interaction footprint as an activity network, allows us to decipher the type of engagement and organization of behavior for each student, which are reflective of attrition.",
        "Similarly (Ramesh et al., 2014; Wen et al., 2014a; Wen et al., 2014b) published results that describe longitudinal discussion forum behavior affecting student dropout, in terms of posting, viewing, voting activity, level of subjectivity (cog- nitive engagement) and positivity (sentiment) in students?",
        "posts.",
        "Related to this, one recent work of (Rossi and Gnawali, 2014) have made an attempt to overcome the language dependency drawback of these works and capture language independent discussion forum features related to structure, popularity, temporal dynamics of threads and diversity of students.",
        "It is important to note, however, that all this substantial research caters to only about 5% of students who participate in MOOC discussion forums (Huang et al., 2014).",
        "Our recent work has laid a preliminary foundation for research investigating students?",
        "information processing behavior while interacting with MOOC video lectures (Sinha et al., 2014).",
        "We apply a cognitive video watching model to explain the dynamic process of cognition involved in MOOC video clickstream interaction and develop a simple, yet potent information processing index that can be effectively used as an operationalization for making predictions regarding critical learner behavior, specifically in-video and course dropouts.",
        "In an attempt to better understand what features are predictive of students ceasing to actively participate in the MOOC, (Veera- machaneni et al., 2014) have integrated a crowd sourcing approach for effective feature engineering at scale.",
        "Among posting, assignment and grading metrics, students?",
        "cohort membership depending on their MOOC engagement was identified as an influential feature for dropout prediction.",
        "3 Study Context The current study is a part of the shared task for EMNLP 2014 Workshop on Modeling Large Scale Social Interaction in Massively Open Online Courses (Ros?e and Siemens, 2014).",
        "We have both video clickstream data (JSON) and discussion forum activity data (SQL) from one Coursera MOOC as training data, that we use in this work.",
        "Our predictive models will also be tested on 5 other Coursera MOOCs.",
        "In general, Coursera forums, divided into various subforums, have a thread starter post that serves as a prompt for discussion.",
        "The thread builds up as people start following up discussions by their posts and comments.",
        "As far as our forum dataset is concerned, we have 31532 instances of forum viewing and 35306 instances of thread viewing.",
        "In addition to this view data, we have 4840 posts and 2652 comments among 1393 threads initiated in the discussion forums during the span of the course, which received 5060 up-votes and 1763 downvotes in total.",
        "To supplement the forum data, we additionally leverage rich video interaction data from the clickstream data.",
        "The clickstream data contains many errors.",
        "We obtained 82 unique video ids from the clickstream data, but only 45 of them are valid (watched by large number of unique students).",
        "The 37 invalid video ids may be simply due to logging errors.",
        "They are also likely to be videos that were uploaded by the course staff for testing purposes.",
        "There are in total 27739 students registered the course, however, only 14312 students had online video interactions.",
        "The rest of the students may have never logged in, or only have viewed the course pages, or have downloaded the videos without further online engagement.",
        "Among the 14312 students who have video interactions, 14264 of them have valid video events logged, which lead to 181100 valid video sessions for our analysis.",
        "These valid video sessions further contain 43 462341 play events, 295103 pause events, 87585 forward jumps, 98169 backward jumps, 6707 forward scrolls, 5311 backward scrolls, 18051 video-play rate increase and 16163 decrease events, respectively.",
        "Our dropout prediction approach that will be described in the next section is applied to student interactions comprising of only online forum and video viewing activities.",
        "Currently, we do not make use of the pageview click data.",
        "4 Technical Approach 1.",
        "To capture the behaviors exhibited in two primary MOOC activities, namely video lecture viewing and forum interaction, we op-erationalize the following metrics: ?",
        "Video lecture clickstream activi-ties: Play (PL), Pause (PA), SeekFw (FW), SeekBw (BW), ScrollFw (FS), ScrollBw (BS), Ratechange Increase (RCI), Ratechange Decrease (RCD).",
        "When two seek events happen in < 1 second, we group them into a scroll.",
        "We encode ratechange event based on whether students sped up or slowed down with respect to playrate of the last click event.",
        "?",
        "Discussion forum activities: Post (Po), Comment (Co), Thread (Th), Upvote (Uv), Downvote (Dv), Viewforum (Vf), Viewthread (Vt) 2.",
        "Because timing of all such MOOC events are logged in our data, we sort all these activities by timestamp to obtain the sequence of activities done by students.",
        "This gives us a simple sequentially ordered time series that can be used to reason about behavioral pattern of students.",
        "3.",
        "We form the interaction footprint sequence for students by concatenating all their different timestamped MOOC activities for every week of MOOC activity.",
        "For example, if a student watched a video (PL, PA, FW, RCI, PA) at [time ?i?, week ?j?",
        "], viewed a forum at time [?i+1?, week ?j?]",
        "and consequently made a post at [time ?i+2?, week ?j?",
        "], his interaction footprint sequence for week ?j?",

        "Such ?n?",
        "consecutively occurring MOOC activities not only characterize suspicious behaviors that might lead to student attrition but also help us to automatically determine the elements of what might be considered ?best MOOC interaction practices?",
        "that keep students engaged.",
        "?",
        "Proportion of video viewing activities among all video interactions, that are active or passive.",
        "We define passive video viewing as mere play and pause (PL, PA), while rest of the video lecture clickstream activities (FW, BW, FS, BS, RCD, RCI) are considered elements of active video viewing.",
        "?",
        "Proportion of discussion forum activities among all forum interactions, that are active or passive.",
        "We define passive forum activities as viewing a forum or thread (Vf, Vt), upvoting and downvoting (Uv, Dv).",
        "The forum activities of starting a thread (Th), posting (Po) and commenting (Co) are indicative of active forum interaction.",
        "In general, because passive video lecture viewing is high (for example, 48% of all video clickstream activities in our dataset comprise of activity sequences having only PL event), discussion forum conversation networks in MOOCs are sparse (only 10% of forum activities relate to explicitly post-ing, commenting or starting a thread) and passive forum activities are very predominant (90% of forum interactions in our dataset are just passively viewing a thread/forum, upvoting or downvoting), differentiating between such active and passive forms of involvement might clarify participation profiles that are most likely to lead to disengagement of stu-44 dents from the MOOC.",
        "5.",
        "In an attempt to enrich the basic ngram representation and better infer traits of active and passive participation, we extract the following set of graph metrics from the overall interaction footprint sequence.",
        "Specifi-cally, in this modeling scheme, we extract consecutive windows of length two and create a directed edge of weight one between the activities appearing in sequential order.",
        "This results in a directed graph (having self loops and parallel edges), with nodes representing activities done by a student in particular week, while the weighted edges representing the frequencies of activities appearing after one another.",
        "For example, in a sequence, (Vt Po Vt Po Po), corresponding nodes in the graph are Vt and Po, while edges are (Vt, Po), (Po, Vt), (Vt, Po) and (Po, Po).",
        "The activity graph thus describes the visible part of the educational activities (who does what and when) and models the structure of activity sequences, rather than the details of each activity.",
        "Features from the syntactic structure of the graph along with their educational semantics are described below.",
        "?",

        "?",
        "Density: Graph density is a tight-knittedness indicator of how involved students are in different MOOC activ-ities, how clustered their activities are or how frequently they switch back and forth between different activities.",
        "Tech-nically, for a directed network, density = m/n(n?1), where m=number of edges, n=number of nodes.",
        "For our multidi-graph representation, density can be >1, because self loops are counted in the total number of edges.",
        "This also implies that values of density >1 denote high persistence in doing particular set of MOOC activities, because of greater number of self loops.",
        "?",
        "Number of self loops: Though graph density provides meaningful interpretations when > 1, we can't conclusively infer activity persistence in an activity graph with low density.",
        "So, we additionally extract number of self loops to refer to the regularity in interaction behavior.",
        "?",
        "Number of Strongly Connected Components (SCC): SCC define a special relationship among a set of graph vertices that can be exploited (each vertex can be reached from every other vertex in the component via a directed path).",
        "If the number of SCC in an activity graph are high, there is a high probability that students performs certain set of activities frequently to successfully achieve their desired learning outcomes in the course.",
        "This might be an influential indicator for behavioral organization and continuity reflected in overall interaction footprint of students.",
        "Dense networks are more likely to have greater number of SCC.",

        "Central activity: We extract top three activities of students with maximum indegree centrality, for each of their participation weeks.",

        "is the fraction of nodes its incoming edges are connected to.",
        "Depending on which are the central activities of students, we can characterize how active or passive is the participation.",
        "For example, Viewthread and Viewforum (Vt, Vf) are more passive forms of participation than Upvote and Downvote (Uv, Dv), which are in turn more passive than Posting, Comment-ing, Thread starting (Po, Co, Th) and other intense forms of video lecture participation that represent high grappling with the course material.",

        "These cluster assignments can then serve as features that help segregating interaction sequences predictive of dropout versus non-dropouts.",
        "Another interesting enhancement to our work would include grouping commonly occurring activities that learners perform in conjunction with each other and form higher level latent categories indicative of different participation traits.",
        "In our computational work, we have recently been developing techniques for operationalizing video lecture clickstreams of students into cognitively plausible higher level behaviors to aid instructors to better understand MOOC hurdles and reason about unsatisfactory learning outcomes (Sinha et al., 2014).",
        "One limitation of the above work is that we are concerned merely with the timestamped order of activities done by a student and not the time gap between activities appearing in the interaction footprint sequence.",
        "The effect of an activity on a subsequent activity often fades out with time, i.e. as the lag between two activities in-creases: learners forget what they learned in a previous activity.",
        "For example, the motivation created at the beginning of a lesson by presenting an interesting application example does not last for-ever, so as to initiate productive forum discussions.",
        "Similarly, the situation of a thread being started (Th) and a post being made (Po) within 60 secs of completing video lecture viewing, might imply a different behavior, than if these forum activities occur five days after video lecture viewing.",
        "Therefore, we seek to better understand context of the most and least central activities of students in MOOCs, differentiating between subsequences lying within and outside user specified temporal windows.",
        "Our goal is to view the interaction footprint sequence formation in a sequential data mining perspective (Mooney and Roddick, 2013) and discover a)most frequently occurring interaction pathways that lead students to such central activ-ities, b)association rules with high statistical confidences that help MOOC instructors to trace why students engage in certain MOOC activities.",
