        "We present a new dependency parsing method for Korean applying cross-lingual transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques.",
        "Unlike existing transfer learning methods relying on aligned corpora or bilingual lexicons, we propose a feature transfer learning method with minimal su-pervision, which adapts an existing parser to the target language by transferring the features for the source language to the target language.",
        "Specifically, we utilize the Triplet/Quadruplet Model, a hybrid parsing algorithm for Japanese, and apply a delexicalized feature transfer for Korean.",
        "Experiments with Penn Korean Treebank show that even using only the transferred features from Japanese achieves a high accuracy (81.6%) for Korean dependency parsing.",
        "Further improvements were obtained when a small annotated Korean corpus was combined with the Japanese training corpus, confirming that efficient cross-lingual transfer learning can be achieved without expensive linguistic resources."

        "Motivated by increasing demands for advanced natural language processing (NLP) applications such as sentiment analysis (Pang et al., 2002; Nasukawa and Yi, 2003) and question answering (Kwok et al., 2001; Ferrucci et al., 2010), there is a growing need for accurate syntactic parsing and semantic analysis of languages, especially for non-English languages with limited linguistic resources.",
        "In this paper, we propose a new dependency parsing method for Korean which requires minimal human supervision.",
        "Dependency parsing can handle long-distance relationships and coordination phenomena very well, and has proven to be very effective for parsing free-order languages such as Korean and Japanese (K?ubler et al., 2009).",
        "Most statistical parsing methods rely on annotated corpora labeled with phrase structures or dependency relationships, but it is very expensive to create a large number of consistent annotations.",
        "Recently, treebanks have become available for many languages such as English, Ger-man, Arabic, and Chinese.",
        "However, the parsing results on these treebanks vary a lot depending on the size of annotated sentences and the type of annotations (Levy and Manning, 2003; McDonald et al., 2013).",
        "Further, many languages lack annotated corpus, or the size of the annotated corpus is too small to develop a reliable statistical method.",
        "To address these problems, there have been several attempts at unsupervised parsing (Seginer, 2007; Spitkovsky et al., 2011), grammar induction (Klein and Manning, 2004; Naseem et al., 2010), and cross-lingual transfer learning using annotated corpora of other languages (Mc- Donald et al., 2011).",
        "However, the accuracies of unsupervised methods are unacceptably low, and results from cross-lingual transfer learning show different outcomes for different pairs of languages, but, in most cases, the parsing accuracy is still low for practical purposes.",
        "A recent study by McDonald et al. (2013) concludes that cross-lingual transfer learning is beneficial when the source and target languages were similar.",
        "In particular, it reports that Korean is an outlier with the lowest scores (42% or less in UAS) when a model was trained from European languages.",
        "In this paper, we present a new cross-lingual 2 transfer learning method that learns a new model for the target language by transferring the features for the source language.",
        "Unlike other approaches which rely on aligned corpora or a bilingual lexicon, we learn a parsing model for Korean by reusing the features and annotated data used in the Japanese dependency parsing, the Triplet/Quadruplet Model (Kanayama et al., 2000), which is a hybrid approach utilizing both grammatical knowledge and statistics.",
        "We exploit many similarities between the two languages, such as the head-final structure, the noun to verb modification via case and topic mark-ers, and the similar word-order constraints.",
        "It was reported that the mapping of the grammar formalism in the language pair was relatively easy (Kim et al., 2003b; Kim et al., 2003a).",
        "However, as the two languages are classified into independent language families (Gordon and Grimes, 2005), there are many significant differences in their morphology and grammar (especially in the writing sys-tems), so it is not trivial to handle the two languages in a uniform way.",
        "We show the Triplet/Quadruplet Model is suitable for bilingual transfer learning, because the grammar rules and heuristics reduce the number of modification candidates and can mitigate the differences between two languages efficiently.",
        "In addition, this model can handle the relationships among the candidates as a richer feature space, making the model less dependent upon the lexical features of the content words that are difficult to align between the two languages.",
        "Similarly to the delexicalized parsing model in (McDonald et al., 2011), we transfer only part-of-speech information of the features for the content words.",
        "We create new mapping rules to extract syntactic features for Korean parsing from the Japanese annotated corpus and refine the grammar rules to get closer modification distributions in two languages.",
        "Our experiments with Penn Korean Treebank (Han et al., 2002) confirm that the Triplet/Quadruplet Model adapted for Korean outperforms a distance-based dependency parsing method, achieving 81.6% accuracy when no annotated Korean corpus was used.",
        "Further performance improvements were obtained when a small size of annotated Korean corpus was added, confirming that our algorithm can be applied without more expensive linguistic resources such as an aligned corpora or bilingual lexicons.",
        "Moreover, the delexicalized feature transfer method enables the algorithm applicable to any two languages that have similar syntactic structures.",
        "2 Related Work 2.1 Parsing for Korean Since Korean is a morphologically-rich language, many efforts for Korean parsing have focused on automatically extracting rich lexical information such as the use of case frame patterns for the verbs (Lee et al., 2007), the acquisition of case frames and nominal phrases from raw corpora (Park et al., 2013), and effective features from phrases and their neighboring contexts (Choi and Palmer, 2011).",
        "Recently, Choi et al. (2012) discussed the transformation of eojeol-based Korean treebank to entity-based treebank to effectively train probabilistic CFG parsers.",
        "We apply similar techniques as in (Choi et al., 2012) to mitigate the differences between Korean and Japanese syntactic structures.",
        "Chung and Rim (2003) applied the Triplet/Quadruplet Model for Korean parsing as done in our work.",
        "They reported that the model performed well for long-distance dependencies, but, in their experiments, the number of modification candidates was not effectively reduced (only 91.5% of phrases were in one of the three positions, while it was 98.6% in Kanayama's work for Japanese).",
        "In this paper, we introduce more sophisticated grammatical knowledge and heuristics to have similar dependency distributions in the two languages.",
        "Smith and Smith (2004) attempted a bilingual parsing for English and Korean by combining statistical dependency parsers, probabilistic context-free grammars, and word translation models into a unified framework that jointly searches for the best English parse, Korean parse and word alignment.",
        "However, we utilize an existing parser and align the features from the source language to the features for the target language, and, thus, our method is applicable to situations where there is no aligned corpora or word translation models.",
        "2.2 Transfer learning and domain adaptation Recently, transfer learning has attracted much at-tention, as it can overcome the lack of training data for new languages or new domains for both classification and regression tasks (Pan and Yang, 2010).",

        "Durrett et al. (2012) and Georgi et al. (2012) show that transfer parsing can be improved when additional bilingual resources are available, such as bilingual dictionaries and parallel corpora of glossed texts respectively.",
        "Our method does not require such resources and does not have restrictions on the sentence type that can be parsed.",
        "Instead, we use a mixture of a small corpus in a target language (i.e., Korean) and a larger corpus of a source language (Japanese).",
        "This task is similar to domain adaptation, and our objective is to outperform the training model built on each language separately.",
        "To avoid the loss of accuracy due to the differences between two do-mains, we apply the domain adaptation technique proposed by Daum?e III (2007) which duplicates the feature space into three categories with each of the features trained by source, by target, and by combined domains.",

        "As these figures show, the syntactic structures are quite similar in these languages: All of the dependencies are directed from left to right, and the postpositional particles determine if the content word modifies a verb (???",

        "Though both corpora consist mainly of newspaper or magazine articles, the sentences are not aligned with each other, so the statistics show the comparisons of the two corpora, rather than the theoretical comparisons of the two languages.",

        "Then, we describe how we apply the Triplet/Quadruplet Model to Korean parsing in Section 4.3.",
        "4.1 Restriction of modification candidates The Triplet/Quadruplet Model utilizes a small number (about 50) of hand-crafted grammar rules that determine whether a PU can modify each PU to its right in a sentence.",
        "The main goal of the grammar rules is to maximize the coverage, and the rules are simple describing high-level syntactic dependencies, and, thus, the rules can be easily created without worrying about the precision or contradictory rules.",
        "The statistical information is later used to select the right rules for a given sentence to produce an accurate parsing result.",
        "Table 2 shows several grammar rules for Japanese, in which the modified PUs are determined depending on the conditions of the rightmost morpheme in the modifier PU.",
        "An analysis of the EDR corpus shows that 98.6% of the correct dependencies are either the nearest PU, the second nearest PU, or the farthest PU from the modifier (more details in Table 4(a)).",

        "In Japanese, 98.6% of correct modified PUs are located in one of the three positions (1st, 2nd or last), but, in Korean, the ratio falls to 93.9% as shown in Table 4.",

        "Further, since the grammar rules are based only on part-of-speech tags and a small number of functional words, they are similar to the delexicalized parser (McDonald et al., 2011).",
        "These delexicalized rules are more robust to linguistic idiosyncrasies, and, thus, are more effective for transfer learning.",
        "7 Conclusion We presented a new dependency parsing algorithm for Korean by applying transfer learning from an existing parser for Japanese.",
        "Unlike other transfer learning methods relying on aligned corpora or bilingual lexical resources, we proposed a feature transfer method utilizing a small number of hand-crafted grammar rules that exploit syntactic similarities of the source and target languages.",
