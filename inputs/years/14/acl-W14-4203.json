        "A large majority of human languages are under-resourced in terms of text corpora and tools available for applications in natural language processing (NLP).",
        "According to recent surveys (Bender, 2011; Uszkoreit and Rehm, 2012; Bender, 2013), this is especially apparent with syntactically annotated corpora, i.e., treebanks ?",
        "both dependency-based ones and others.",
        "In this paper, we focus on dependency parsing (K?ubler et al., 2009), but the claims should hold in general.",
        "The lack of dependency treebanks is due to the fact that they are expensive and time-consuming to construct (Abeill?e, 2003).",
        "Since dependency parsing of under-resourced languages nonetheless draws substantial interest in the NLP research commu-nity, over time, we have seen a number of research efforts directed towards their processing despite the absence of training data for supervised learning of parsing models.",
        "We give a brief overview of the major research directions in the following subsection.",
        "Here, we focus on supervised learning of dependency parsers, as the performance of unsupervised approaches still falls far behind the state of the art in supervised parser induction.",
        "1.1 Related Work There are two basic strategies for data-driven parsing of languages with no dependency treebanks: annotation projection and model transfer.",
        "Both fall into the general category of cross-lingual dependency parsing as they attempt to utilize existing dependency treebanks or parsers from a resource-rich language (source) for parsing the under-resourced (target) language.",
        "Annotation projection: In this approach, dependency trees are projected from a source language to a target language using word alignments in parallel corpora.",
        "It is based on a presumption that source-target parallel corpora are more readily available than dependency treebanks.",
        "The approach comes in two varieties.",
        "In the first one, parallel corpora are exploited by applying the available state-of-the-art parsers on the source side and subsequent projection to the target side using word alignments and heuristics for resolving possible link ambiguities (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Hwa et al., 2005).",
        "Since dependency parsers typically make heavy use of various morphological and other features, the apparent benefit of this approach is the possibility of straightforward projection of these features, resulting in a feature-rich representation for the target language.",
        "On the downside, the annotation projection noise adds up to dependency parsing noise and errors in word alignment, influencing the quality of the resulting target language parser.",
        "The other variety is rare, since it relies on parallel corpora in which the source side is a depen-13 dency treebank, i.e., it is already manually annotated for syntactic dependencies (Agi?c et al., 2012).",
        "This removes the automatic parsing noise, while the issues with word alignment and annotation heuristics still remain.",
        "Model transfer: In its simplest form, transferring a model amounts to training a source language parser and running it directly on the target language.",
        "It is usually coupled with delexicaliza-tion, i.e., removing all lexical features from the source treebank for training the parser (Zeman and Resnik, 2008; McDonald et al., 2013).",
        "This in turn relies on the same underlying feature model, typically drawing from a shared part-of-speech (POS) representation such as the Universal POS Tagset of Petrov et al. (2012).",
        "Negative effects of using such an impoverished shared representation are typically addressed by adapting the model to better fit the target language.",
        "This includes selecting source language data points appropriate for the target language (S?gaard, 2011; T?ackstr?om et al., 2013), transferring from multiple sources (McDonald et al., 2011) and using cross-lingual word clusters (T?ackstr?om et al., 2012).",
        "These approaches need no projection and enable the usage of source-side gold standard annotations, but they all rely on a shared feature representation across languages, which can be seen as a strong bottleneck.",
        "Also, while most of the earlier research made use of heterogenous treebanks and thus yielded linguistically implausible observations, research stemming from an uniform dependency scheme across languages (De Marneffe and Manning, 2008; McDonald et al., 2013) made it possible to perform more consistent experiments and to assess the accuracy of dependency labels.",
        "Other approaches: More recently, Durrett et al. (2012) suggested a hybrid approach that involves bilingual lexica in cross-lingual phrase-based parsing.",
        "In their approach, a source-side treebank is adapted to a target language by ?trans- lating?",
        "the source words to target words through a bilingual lexicon.",
        "This approach is advanced by Tiedemann et al. (2014), who utilize full-scale statistical machine translation (SMT) systems for generating synthetic target language tree-banks.",
        "This approach relates to annotation pro-jection, while bypassing the issue of dependency parsing noise as gold standard annotations are projected.",
        "The SMT noise is in turn mitigated by better word alignment quality for synthetic data.",
        "The influence of various projection algorithms in this approach is further investigated by Tiedemann (2014).",
        "This line of cross-lingual parsing research substantially improves over previous work.",
        "1.2 Paper Overview All lines of previous cross-lingual parsing research left the topics of related languages and shared rich feature representations largely unaddressed, with the exception of Zeman and Resnik (2008), who deal with phrase-based parsing test-cased on Danish and Swedish treebanks, utilizing a mapping over relatively small POS tagsets.",
        "In our contribution, the goal is to observe the properties of cross-lingual parsing in an environment of relatively free-word-order languages, which are related and characterized by rich morphology and very large morphosyntactic tagsets.",
        "We experiment with four different small- and medium-size dependency treebanks of Croatian and Slovene, and cross-lingually parse into Croa-tian, Serbian and Slovene.",
        "Along with monolingual and direct transfer parsing, we make use of the SMT framework of Tiedemann et al. (2014).",
        "We are motivated by: ?",
        "observing the performance of various approaches to cross-lingual dependency parsing for closely related languages, including the very recent treebank translation approach by Tiedemann et al. (2014); ?",
        "doing so by using rich morphosyntactic tagsets, in contrast to virtually all other recent cross-lingual dependency parsing experiments, which mainly utilize the Universal POS tagset of Petrov et al. (2012); ?",
        "reliably testing for labeled parsing accuracy in an environment with heterogenous dependency annotation schemes; and ?",
        "improving the state of the art for Croatian, Slovene and Serbian dependency parsing across these heterogenous schemes.",

        "Its most recent instance, HOBS 2.0 (Agi?c et al., 2014) slightly departs from the PDT scheme.",
        "Thus, in this exper-iment, we use the older version, HOBS 1.0, and henceforth refer to it as hr PDT for consistency and more clear reference to its annotation.",
        "2 hr SET: The SETIMES.HR dependency treebank of Croatian has a 15-tag scheme.",
        "It is targeted towards high parsing accuracy, while maintaining a clear distinction between all basic grammatical categories of Croatian.",

        "Here, we use an even newer, recently developed version with more than 8,500 sentences from multiple domains.",
        "3 sl PDT: The PDT-based Slovene Dependency Treebank (D?zeroski et al., 2006) is built on top of a rather small portion of Orwell's novel 1984 from the Multext East project (Erjavec, 2012).",

        "The initial 100,000 token corpus has recently doubled in size, as described by Dobrovoljc et al. (2012).",
        "We use the latter version in our experiment.",
        "5 The statistics in Table 1 show a variety of treebank sizes and annotations.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the structural complexity of the treebanks by providing a histogram of egdes by token distance.",
        "While adjacent edges expectedly dominate the distribu-tions, it is interesting to see that almost 30% of all edges in sl SSJ attach to root, resulting in an easily parsable flattened tree structure.",
        "Knowing that relations denoting attributes account for more than one third of all non-root dependents in the re-mainder, one can expect dependency parsing performance comparable to CoNLL-style chunking (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000).",
        "This is further supported by the distributions of sentences in the four treebanks by average tree depth in Figure 2.",
        "We can see that virtually all sl SSJ trees have average depths of 1 to 3, while the other treebanks exhibit the more common structural properties of dependency trees.",
        "In these terms of complexity, the Croatian treebanks are richer than their Slovene counterparts.",
        "In sl SSJ, attributes and edges to root account for more than 60% of all dependencies.",
        "Even in the other three treebanks, 20-30% of the edges are labeled as attributes, while the rest is spread more evenly between the basic syntactic categories such as predicates, subject and objects.",
        "More detailed and more linguistically motivated comparisons of the three annotation guidelines fall outside the scope of our paper.",
        "Instead, we refer to the previously noted publications on the respective tree-banks, and to (Agi?c and Merkler, 2013; Agi?c et al., 2013) for comparisons between PDT and SET in parsing Croatian and Serbian.",
        "2.2 Morphosyntactic Tagset All four treebanks were manually created: they are sentence- and token-split, lemmatized, mor-phosyntactically tagged and syntactically annotated.",
        "In morphosyntactic annotation, they all make use of the Multext East version 4 (MTE 4) guidelines (Erjavec, 2012).",
        "6 MTE 4 is a positional tagset in which morphosyntactic descriptors of word forms are captured by a morphosyn-5 http://eng.slovenscina.eu/ tehnologije/ucni-korpus 6 http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V4/ tactic tag (MSD) created by merging atomic attributes in the predefined positions.",
        "This is illustrated in Table 2 through an example verb tag.",
        "The first character of the tag denotes the part of speech (POS), while each of the following characters encodes a specific attribute in a specific position.",
        "Both the positions and the attributes are language-dependent in MTE 4, but the attributes are still largely shared between these three languages due to their relatedness.",
        "The Slovene treebanks closely adhere to the specification, while each of the Croatian treebanks implements slight adaptations of the tagset towards Croatian specifics.",
        "In hr PDT, the adaptation is governed by and documented in the Croatian Morphological Lexicon (Tadi?c and Fulgosi, 2003), and the modifications in hr SET were targeted to more closely match the ones for Slovene.",
        "7 2.3 Test Sets Recent research by McDonald et al. (2013) has uncovered the downsides of experimenting with parsing using heterogenous dependency annota-tions, while at the same time providing possibly the first reliable results in cross-lingual parsing.",
        "They did so by creating the uniformly annotated Universal Dependency Treebanks collection based on Stanford Typed Dependencies (De Marneffe and Manning, 2008), which in turn also enabled measuring both labeled (LAS) and unla-beled (UAS) parsing accuracy.",
        "Having four treebanks with three different annotation schemes, we seek to enable reliable experimentation through our test sets.",
        "Along with Croatian and Slovene, which are represented in the training sets, we introduce Serbian as a target-only language in the test data.",
        "Following the CoNLL shared tasks setup (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007), our test sets have 200 sentences (approx.",
        "5,000 tokens) per language, split 50:50 between newswire and Wikipedia text.",
        "Each test set is manually annotated for morphosyntax, following the MTE 4 guidelines for the respective languages, and checked by native speakers for validity.",
        "On top of that, all test sets are annotated with all three dependency schemes: PDT, SET and SSJ.",
        "This enables observing LAS in a heterogenous experimental environment, as we test each monolingual and cross-lingual parser on an anno-7 http://nlp.ffzg.hr/data/tagging/ msd-hr.html 16 Language MSD tag Attribute-value pairs hr Vmn Category = Verb, Type = main, Vform = infinitive sl Vmen Category = Verb, Type = main, Aspect = perfective, VForm = infinitive sr Vmn----an-n---e Category = Verb, Type = main, VForm = infinitive, Voice = active, Negative = no, Clitic = no, Aspect = perfective Table 2: Illustration of the Multext East version 4 tagset for Croatian, Serbian and Slovene.",
        "The attributes are language-dependent, as well as their positions in the tag, which are also dependent on the part of speech, denoted by position zero in the tag.",
        "tation layer matching its training set.",
        "In contrast, the MTE 4 tagsets are not adjusted, i.e., each test set only has a single language-specific MTE 4 annotation.",
        "We rely on their underlying similarities in feature representations to suffice for improved cross-lingual parsing performance.",
        "3 Experiment Setup This section describes the experiment settings.",
        "We list the general workflow of the experiment and then provide the details on the parser setup and the more advanced approaches used for target language adaptation of the models.",
        "3.1 Workflow The experiment consists of three work packages: (1) monolingual parsing, (2) direct cross-lingual parsing, and (3) cross-lingual parsing using synthetic training data from SMT.",
        "In the first one, we train dependency parsers on the four treebanks and test them on the corresponding languages, thus assessing the monolingual parsing performance.",
        "The second stage observes the effects of directly applying the parsers from the first stage across the languages.",
        "Finaly, in the third work package, we use four different approaches to automatic translation to create synthetic training data.",
        "We translate the Croatian treebanks to Slovene and vice versa, project the annotations using two different projection algorithms, and train and apply the adapted parsers across the languages.",
        "The details are included in the two following subsections.",
        "Two general remarks apply to our experiment.",
        "First, we perform cross-lingual parsing, and not cross-annotation-scheme parsing.",
        "Thus, we do not compare the dependency parsing scores between the annotation schemes, but rather just between the in-scheme parsers.",
        "Second, we use Serbian as a test-set-only language.",
        "As there are no treebanks of Serbian, we cannot use it as a source language, and we leave SMT and annotation projection into Serbian for future work.",
        "3.2 Dependency Parsing In all experiments, we use the graph-based dependency parser by Bohnet (2010) with default settings.",
        "We base our parser choice on its state-of-the-art performance across various morphologically rich languages in the SPMLR 2013 shared task (Seddah et al., 2013).",
        "While newer contributions targeted at joint morphological and syntactic analysis (Bohnet and Kuhn, 2012; Bohnet et al., 2013) report slightly higher scores, we chose the former one for speed and robustness, and because we use gold standard POS/MSD annotations.",
        "The choice of gold standard preprocessing is motivated by previous research in parsing Croatian and Serbian (Agi?c et al., 2013), and by insight of Seddah et al. (2013), who report a predictable linear decrease in accuracy for automatic preprocessing.",
        "This decrease amounts to approximately 3 points LAS for Croatian and Serbian across various test cases in (Agi?c et al., 2013).",
        "We observe effects of (de)lexicalization and of using full MSD tagset as opposed to only POS tags in all experiments.",
        "Namely, in all work packages, we compare parsers trained with {lexicalized, delexicalized} ?",
        "{MSD, POS} features.",
        "In lexicalized parsers, we use word forms and features, while we exclude lemmas from all experiments ?",
        "both previous research using MSTParser (McDon- ald et al., 2005) and our own test runs show no use for lemmas as features in dependency parsing.",
        "Delexicalized parsers are stripped of all lexical features, i.e., word forms are omitted from training and testing data.",
        "Full MSD parsers use both the POS information and the sub-POS features in the form of atomic attribute-value pairs, while POS-only parsers are stripped of the MSD features ?",
        "they use just the POS information.",
        "The delexicalized POS scenario is thus very similar to the 17 direct transfer by McDonald et al. (2013), since MTE 4 POS is virtually identical to Universal POS (Petrov et al., 2012).",
        "8 3.3 Treebank Translation and Annotation Projection For machine translation, we closely adhere to the setup implemented by Tiedemann et al. (2014) in their treebank translation experiments.",
        "Namely, our translations are based on automatic word alignment and subsequent extraction of translation equivalents as common in phrase-based SMT.",
        "We perform word alignment by using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), while utilizing IBM model 4 for creating the Viterbi word alignments for parallel corpora.",
        "For the extraction of translation tables, we use the de facto standard SMT toolbox Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) with default settings.",
        "Phrase-based SMT models are tuned using minimum error rate training (Och, 2003).",
        "Our monolingual language modeling using KenLM tools 9 (Heafield, 2011) produces standard 5-gram language models using modified Kneser-Ney smoothing without pruning.",
        "For building the translation models, we use the OpenSubtitles parallel resources from OPUS 10 (Tiedemann, 2009) for the Croatian-Slovene pair.",
        "Even if we expect this to be a rather noisy parallel resource, we justify the choice by (1) the fact that no other parallel corpora 11 of Croatian and Slovene exist, other than Orwell's 1984 from the Multext East project, which is too small for SMT training and falls into a very narrow domain, and (2) evidence from (Tiedemann et al., 2014) that the SMT-supported cross-lingual parsing approach is very robust to translation noise.",
        "For translating Croatian treebanks into Slovene and vice versa, we implement and test four different methods of translation.",
        "They are coupled with approaches to annotation projection from the source side gold dependency trees to the target translations via the word alignment information available from SMT.",
        "8 A mapping from Slovene MTE 4 to Universal POS is available at https://code.google.com/p/ universal-pos-tags/ as an example.",
        "9 https://kheafield.com/code/kenlm/ 10 http://opus.lingfil.uu.se/ 11 We note the Croatian-Slovene parallel corpus project described by Po?zgaj Had?zi and Tadi?c (2000), but it appears that the project was not completed and the corpus itself is not publicly available.",
        "LOOKUP: The first approach to translation in our experiment is the dictionary lookup approach.",
        "We simply select the most reliable translations of single words in the source language into the target language by looking up the phrase translation tables extracted from the parallel corpus.",
        "This is very similar to what Agi?c et al. (2012) did for the Croatian-Slovene pair.",
        "However, their approach involved both translating and testing on the same small corpus (Orwell's novel), while here we extract the translations from full-blown SMT phrase tables on a much larger scale.",
        "The trees projection from source to target is trivial since the number and the ordering of words between them does not change.",
        "Thus, the dependencies are simply copied.",
        "CHAR: By this acronym, we refer to an approach known as character-based statistical machine translation.",
        "It is shown to perform very well for closely related languages (Vilar et al., 2007; Tiedemann, 2012; Tiedemann and Nakov, 2013).",
        "The motivation for character-level translation is the ability of such models to better generalize the mapping between similar languages especially in cases of rich productive morphology and limited amounts of training data.",
        "With this, character-level models largely reduce the number of out-of-vocabulary words.",
        "In a nutshell, our character-based model performs word-to-word translation using character-level modeling.",
        "Similar to LOOKUP, this is also a word-to-word translation model, which also requires no adaptation of the source dependency trees ?",
        "they are once again simply copied to target sentences.",
        "WORD: Our third take on SMT is slightly more elaborate but still restricts the translation model to one-to-one word mappings.",
        "In particular, we extract all single word translation pairs from the phrase tables and apply the standard beam-search decoder implemented in Moses to translate the original treebanks to all target languages.",
        "Thus, we allow word reordering and use a language model while still keeping the projection of annotated data as simple as possible.",

        "Generally, the best transfer scores are quite high in comparison with those on Universal Treebanks (McDonald et al., 2013; Tiedemann et al., 2014).",
