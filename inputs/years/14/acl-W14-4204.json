        "Spanish (or castellano), a descendant of Latin, is currently the language with the second largest number of native speakers after Mandarin Chi-nese, namely around 414 million people (Lewis et al., 2014).",
        "Spanish has a large number of regional varieties across Spain and the Americas (Lipski, 1994).",
        "1 They diverge in spoken language and vocabulary and also, albeit to a lesser extent, in syntax.",
        "Between different American varieties of Spanish, there are important differences; how-ever, the largest differences can be found between American and European (?Peninsular?)",
        "Spanish.",
        "Language identification, the task of automatically identifying the natural language used in a given text segment, is a relatively well understood problem (see Section 2).",
        "To our knowledge, how-ever, there is little previous work on the identification of the varieties of a single language, such as the regional varieties of Spanish.",
        "This task is especially challenging because the differences between 1 We are aware that there are natively Spanish-speaking communities elsewhere, such as on the Philippines, but we do not consider them in this study.",
        "variants are subtle, making it difficult to discern between them.",
        "This is evidenced by the fact that humans that are native speakers of the varieties are often unable to solve the problem, particularly when given short, noisy text segments (which are the focus of this work) where the amount of available information is limited.",
        "In this paper, we approximate the problem of language variety identification by the problem of classifying status messages from the micro-blogging service Twitter (?tweets?)",
        "from Spanish speaking countries by the country from which they were sent.",
        "With the tweet, the location of the device from which the tweet was sent can be recorded (depending on the Twitter users?",
        "permis-sion) and can then be retrieved from the metadata of the tweet.",
        "The tweet location information does not always correlate with the actual language variety used in the tweet: it is conceivable, e.g., that migrants do not use the prevalent language variety of the country in which they live, but rather their native variety.",
        "Nevertheless, Twitter can give a realistic picture of actual language use in a certain region, which, additionally, is closer to spoken than to standard written language.",
        "Eventually and more importantly, Twitter data is available from almost all Spanish speaking countries.",
        "We proceed as follows.",
        "We build a balanced collection of tweets sent by Twitter users from five countries, namely Argentina, Chile, Colom-bia, Mexico, and Spain.",
        "Applying different meth-ods, we perform an automatic classification between all countries.",
        "In order to obtain a more detailed view of the difficulty of our task, we also investigate human performance.",
        "For this purpose, we build a smaller sample of tweets from Ar-gentina, Chile and Spain and have them classified by both our system and three native human evaluators.",
        "The results show that automatic classification outperforms human annotators.",
        "The best variant of our system, using a meta-classifier with voting, 25 reaches an overall F-score of 67.72 on the five-class problem.",
        "On the two-class problem, human classification is outperformed by a large margin.",

        "Section 7 discusses the results, and Section 8 concludes the article.",
        "2 Related Work Research on language identification has seen a variety of methods.",
        "A well established technique is the use of character n-gram models.",
        "Cavnar and Trenkle (1994) build n-gram frequency ?profiles?",
        "for several languages and classify text by matching it to the profiles.",
        "Dunning (1994) uses language modeling.",
        "This technique is general and not limited to language identification; it has also been successfully employed in other areas, e.g., in authorship attribution (Ke?selj et al., 2003) and author native language identification (Gyawali et al., 2013).",
        "Other language identification systems use non-textual methods, exploiting optical properties of text such as stroke geometry (Muir and Thomas, 2000), or using compression methods which rely on the assumption that natural languages differ by their entropy, and consequently by the rate to which they can be compressed (Teahan, 2000; Benedetto et al., 2002).",
        "Two newer approaches are Brown (2013), who uses character n-grams, and ?",
        "Reh?u?rek and Kolkus (2009), who treat ?noisy?",
        "web text and therefore consider the particular influence of single words in discriminating between languages.",
        "Language identification is harder the shorter the text segments whose language is to be identified (Baldwin and Lui, 2010).",
        "Especially due to the rise of Twitter, this particular problem has recently received attention.",
        "Several solutions have been proposed.",
        "Vatanen et al. (2010) compare character n-gram language models with elaborate smoothing techniques to the approach of Cavnar and Trenkle and the Google Language ID API, on the basis of different versions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.",
        "Other researchers work on Twitter.",
        "Bergsma et al. (2012) use language identification to create language specific tweet col-lections, thereby facilitating more high-quality results with supervised techniques.",
        "Lui and Baldwin (2014) review a wide range of off-the-shelf tools for Twitter language identification, and achieve their best results with a voting over three individual systems, one of them being langid.py (Lui and Baldwin, 2012).",
        "Carter et al. (2013) exploit particular characteristics of Twitter (such as user profile data and relations between Twitter users) to improve language identification on this genre.",
        "Bush (2014) successfully uses LZW compression for Twitter language identification.",
        "Within the field of natural language processing, the problem of language variant identification has only begun to be studied very recently.",
        "Zampieri et al. (2013) have addressed the task for Spanish newspaper texts, using character and word n-gram models as well as POS and morphological information.",
        "Very recently, the Discriminating between Similar Languages (DSL) Shared Task (Zampieri et al., 2014) proposed the problem of identifying between pairs of similar languages and language variants on sentences from newspaper cor-pora, one of the pairs being Peninsular vs. Argentine Spanish.",
        "However, all these approaches are tailored to the standard language found in news sources, very different from the colloquial, noisy language of tweets, which presents distinct challenges for NLP (Derczynski et al., 2013; Vilares et al., 2013).",
        "Lui and Cook (2013) evaluate various approaches to classify documents into Australian, British and Canadian English, including a corpus of tweets, but we are not aware of any previous work on variant identification in Spanish tweets.",

        "3 To ensure homogeneous conditions for our experiments, our final tweet collection comprises exactly 100,000 tweets from each of the five countries from which most tweets were collected, that is, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Spain.",
        "At this stage, we do not perform any cleanup or normalization operations such as, e.g., deleting forwarded tweets (?re-tweets?",
        "), deleting tweets which are sent by robots, or tweets not written in Spanish (some tweets use code switching, or are entirely written in a different language, mostly in English or in regional and minority languages that coexist with Spanish in the focus countries).",
        "Our reasoning behind this is that the tweet production in a certain country captures the variant of Spanish that is spoken.",
        "We mark the start and end of single tweets by <s> and </s>, respectively.",
        "We use 80% of the tweets of each language for training, and 10% for development and testing, respectively.",
        "The data is split in a round-robin fashion, i.e., every ninth tweet is put into the development set and every tenth tweet is put in the test set, all other tweets are put in the training set.",
        "In order to help with the interpretation of classification results, we investigate the distribution of tweet lengths on the development set, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "We see that in all countries, tweets tend to be either short, or take advantage of all available characters.",
        "Lengths around 100 to 110 characters are the rarest.",
        "The clearest further trend is that the tweets from Colombia and, especially, Argentina tend to be shorter than the tweets from the other countries.",
        "4 Automatic Tweet Classification The classification task we envisage is similar to the task of language identification in short text segments.",
        "We explore three methods that have been used before for that task, namely character n-gram frequency profiles (Cavnar and Trenkle, 1994; Vatanen et al., 2010), character n-gram language models (Vatanen et al., 2010), as well as LZW compression (Bush, 2014).",
        "Furthermore, we explore the usability of syllable-based language 3 We are aware that the Twitter API does not make all sent tweets available.",
        "However, we still assume that this huge difference reflects a variance in the number of Twitter users.",

        "In 3,515 (7%), 4,839 (10%), 5,455 (11%) and 6,102 (12%) cases, respectively, the correct result was hidden in a tie.",
        "If we replace the labels of all tied instances with a new label TIE, we obtain the F-scores shown in Table 7.",
        "While they are higher than the scores for n-gram frequency pro-files, they still lie well below the results for both syllable and character language models.",
        "While previous literature mentions an ideal size limit on the dictionary of 8k entries (Bush, 2014), we obtain better results the larger the dictionaries.",
        "Note that already with a dictionary of size 1000, even without including the ties, we are above the 20.00 F-score of a random baseline.",
        "The high rate of ties constitutes a major problem of this ap-proach, and remains even if we would find improvements to the approach (one possibility could be to use unicode characters instead of bytes for dictionary initialization).",

        "In terms of error rate, the human annotators made between 3 and 4 times more classification errors than the automatic system.",

        "For a simplified version of the problem that only required a decision between two classes (Argentina vs. Chile and Spain vs. Argentina), given a sample of 150 tweets from each class, human classification was outperformed by automatic classification by up to 31 points.",
