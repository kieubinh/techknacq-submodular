        "Each method had lower accuracy for place names than for persons?",
        "names.",
        "The reasons are as follows.",
        "One problem is that some of the characters in the place names are used only in place names, and though they appear in the test set, they do not appear in the training set.",
        "This is the out-of-vocabulary problem, which is a major issue with the corpus-based method.",

        "The sense-based translation method is more accurate than pialign especially in translating type 2 and 3.",
        "This is because our discard process is able to delete infrequently used kanji in the corpus from the training data.",

        "An idiomatic translation dictionary is required for this purpose.",
