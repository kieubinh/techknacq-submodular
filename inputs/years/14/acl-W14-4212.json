        "This paper introduces the first step in this direction the comparison of results of two different systems for two really very closely related languages Czech and Slovak.",
        "2 State of the art There has already been a lot of research in Machine Translation evaluation.",

        "The novelty of the presented paper is in the focus on machine translation for closely related languages and in the comparison of the two mostly used paradigms for this task: shallow parse and transfer RBMT and SMT paradigms.",

        "?lko (Haji?c et al., 2003) was used as a representative of rule-based MT systems, the translation direction from Czech to Slovak was naturally chosen because this is the only direction this system supports for this particular language pair.",
        "The on-line publicly available versions of the systems sere used in the experiment to ensure the reproducibility of the experiment.",
        "All the test data is publicly available at the language technologies server of the University of Primorska 2 .",
        "Let us now introduce the systems in a more detail.",
        "3.1 Google Translate This system is currently probably the most popular and most widely used MT system in the world.",
        "It belongs to the Statistical Machine Translation ?",
        "SMT paradigm.",
        "SMT is based on parametric statistical models, which are constructed on bilingual aligned corpora (training data).",
        "The methods focus on looking for general patterns that arise in the use of language instead of ana-lyzing sentences according to grammatical rules.",
        "The main tool for finding such patterns is counting a variety of objects ?",
        "statistics.",
        "The main idea of the paradigm is to model the probability that parts of a sentence from the source language translate into suitable parts of sentence in the target language.",
        "The system takes advantage of the vast parallel resources which Google Inc. has at their disposal and it is therefore able to translate a large number of language pairs.",
        "Currently (July 2014), this system offers automatic translation among 80 languages.",
        "This makes it a natural candidate as a universal quality standard for MT, especially for pairs of smaller (underrepresented) languages for which there are very few MT systems.",
        "3.2 ?",
        "Ces?",
        "?lko One of the first systems which fully relied on the similarity of related languages, ?",
        "Ces?",
        "?lko (Haji?c et al., 2003), had originally a very simple architecture.",
        "Its first implementation translated from Czech to Slovak.",
        "It used the method of direct word-for-word translation (after necessary morphological processing).",
        "More precisely, it translated each lemma obtained by morphological analysis and morphological tag provided by a tagger to a lemma and a corresponding tag in the target language.",
        "For the translation of lemmas it was necessary to use a bilingual dictionary, the differences in morphology of both languages, although to a large extent regular, did not allow to use a simple transliteration.",
        "The translation 2 Test data: http://jt.upr.si/research_ projects/related_languages/ of lemmas was necessary due to differences in tagsets of the source and target language.",
        "The syntactic similarity of both languages allowed the omission of syntactic analysis of the source language and syntactic synthesis of the target one, therefore the dictionary phase of the system had been immediately followed by morphological synthesis of the target language.",
        "No changes of the word order were necessary, the target language order of words preserved the word order of the source language.",
        "Later versions of the system experimented with the architecture change involving the omission of the source language tagger and the addition of a stochastic ranker of translation hypothesis at the target language side.",
        "The purpose of this experiment was to eliminate tagging errors at the beginning of the translation process and to enable more variants of translation from which the stochastic ranker chose the most probable hypothesis.",
        "This change has been described for example in (Homola and Kubo?n, 2008).",
        "For the purpose of our experiment we are using the original version of the system which has undergone some minor improvements (better tagger, improved dictionary etc.)",
        "and which is publicly available for testing at the website of the LINDAT project 3 .",
        "The decision to use this version is natural, given the fact that this is the only publicly available version of the system.",
        "4 Methodology In the planning phase of our experiment it was necessary to make a couple of decisions which could cause certain bias and invalidate the results obtained.",
        "First of all, the choice of the language pair (Czech to Slo-vak) was quite natural.",
        "These languages show very high degree of similarity at all levels (morphological, syntactic, semantic) and thus they constitute an ideal language pair for the development of simplified rule-based architecture.",
        "We are of course aware that for a complete answer to this question it would be necessary to test more systems and more language pairs, but in this phase of our experiments we do not aim at obtaining a complete answer, our main goal is to develop a methodology and to perform some kind of pilot testing showing the possible directions of future research.",
        "The second important decision concerned the method of evaluation.",
        "Our primary goal was to set up a method which would be relatively simple and fast, thus allowing to manually (the reasons for manual evaluation are given in 4.2.1 subsection) process reasonable volume of results.",
        "The second goal concerned the en-deavor to estimate evaluator's confidence in their judg-ments.",
        "4.1 Basic properties of the language pair The language pair used in our experiment belongs to western Slavic language group.",
        "We must admit that 3 ?",
        "Ces?",
        "?lko: http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/ services/cesilko/ 93 the reason for choosing this language group was purely pragmatic ?",
        "there is an extensive previous experience with the translation of several language pairs from this group, see, e.g. (Haji?c et al., 2003), (Homola and Kubo?n, 2008) or (Homola and Vi?ci?c, 2010).",
        "On top of that, the availability of the ?",
        "Ces?",
        "?lko demo in the LINDAT repository for the free translation of up to 5000 characters naturally led to the decision to use this system (although it is in fact the original version of the system with very simple architecture).",
        "Czech and Slovak represent the closest language pair among the western Slavic languages.",
        "Their morphology and syntax are very similar, their lexicons slightly differ, their word order is free (and also similar).",
        "In the former Czechoslovakia it was quite common that people understood both languages very well, but after the split of the country the younger people who don't have regular contact with the other language experience certain difficulties because the number of the words unknown to them is not negligible.",
        "However, the greatest challenge for the word-for-word translation approach is not the lexicon (the differences in the lexicon can be handled by a bilingual dictionary), but the ambiguity of word forms.",
        "These are typically not part-of-speech ambiguities, they are quite rare although they do exist (st?at [to stay/the state], ?zena [woman/chasing] or t?ri [three/rub(imper.",
        ")]), how-ever, the greatest challenge is the ambiguity of gender, number and case (for example, the form of the adjective jarn??",
        "[spring] is 27-way ambiguous).",
        "Resolving this ambiguity is very important for translation because Czech has very strict requirements on agreement (not only subject predicate agreement, but also agreement in number, gender and case in nominal groups).",
        "Even though several Slavic languages including Slovak exhibit similar richness of word forms, the morphological ambiguity is not preserved at all or it is preserved only partially, it is distributed in a different manner and the ?form-for-form?",
        "translation is not applicable.",
        "For example, if we want to translate the Czech expression jarn??",
        "louka [a spring meadow] into Slovak word for word, it is necessary to disambiguate the adjective which has the same form in Czech for all four genders (in Czech, there are two masculine genders animate and inanimate) while in Slovak, there are three different forms for masculin, feminin and neutral gender - jarn?y, jarn?a, jarn?e.",
        "The disambiguation is performed by a state-of-the art stochastic tagger.",
        "Although this brings a stochastic factor into the system, we still consider ?",
        "Ces?",
        "?lko to be primarily rule based system.",
        "4.2 Experiment outline The aim of the experiment was double: to show the quality of the simple RBMT methods (shallow-parse and shallow transfer RBMT) in comparison to the state-of-the-art SMT system.",
        "The second part of the experiment was to outline the most obvious and most challenging errors produced by each translation paradigm.",
        "4.2.1 Translation quality evaluation This part of the experiment relied on the methodology similar to that used in the 2013 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (Bojar et al., 2013).",
        "We conducted manual evaluation of both systems?",
        "outputs consisting of ranking individual translated sentences according to the translation quality (the evaluators had access to the original sentence).",
        "Unlike the ranking of the SMT Workshop which worked always with 5 trans-lations, our task was much simpler and the ranking naturally consisted of ranking translated sentences of both systems.",
        "The evaluator indicated which of the two systems is better, having also the chance to indicate that both translations are identical, because the systems produced relatively large number of identical results see section 5).",
        "The reason why we didn't automatic measures of translation quality was quite natural.",
        "After a period of wide acceptance of automatic measures like BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001) or NIST (NIST, 2009), recent MT evaluation experiments seem to prefer manual methods.",
        "Many papers such as Callison-Burch et al. (2006) and authors of workshops such as WMT 2013 (Bojar et al., 2013) contend that automatic measures of machine translation quality are an imperfect substitute for human assessments, especially when it is necessary to compare different systems (or, even worse, the systems based on different paradigms).",
        "4.2.2 Test data Our evaluation is based upon a small, yet relevant, test corpus.",
        "Because one of the systems undergoing the evaluation has been developed by Google, the creation of the test set required special attention.",
        "We could not use any already existing on-line corpus as Google regularly enhances language models with new language data.",
        "Any on-line available corpus could have already been included in the training data of Google Translate, thus the results of the evaluation would have been biased towards the SMT system.",
        "Therefore we have decided to use fresh newspaper texts which cannot be part of any training data set used by Google.",
        "We have selected 200 sentences from fresh newspaper articles of the biggest Czech on-line daily newspapers.",
        "Several headline news were selected in order to avoid author bias although the the domain remained daily news.",
        "We have selected articles from ?iDnes?",
        "4 , ?Lidovky?",
        "5 and ?Novinky?",
        "6 .",
        "The test set was created from randomly selected articles on the dates between 14.7.2014 and 18.7.2014.",
        "All the test-data is publicly available at the language technologies server of the University of Primorska 2 .",
        "This part of the experiment consisted in manually examining the translated data from the translation quality evaluation task (described in section 4.2.1).",
        "As we have 4 iDnes: http://www.idnes.cz/ 5 Lidovky: http://www.lidovky.cz/ 6 Novinky: http://www.novinky.cz/ 94 expected, the most common errors of ?",
        "Ces?",
        "?lko were out of the vocabulary errors.",
        "The dictionary coverage of the system has apparently been inadequate for a wide variety of topics from daily news.",
        "The results are presented in section 5.1.",
        "5 Results The results of our experiment are summarized in Table 1.",
        "The evaluation has been performed by 5 native speakers of Slovak, the sentences have been randomized so that no evaluator could know which of the two systems produced which translation.",
        "The evaluators were asked to mark which translation they consider to be better.",
        "Ties were not allowed, but the evaluators were also asked to mark identical sentences.",
        "This requirement served also as a kind of thoroughness check, too many unrecognized identical sentences could indicate that the evaluator lost concentration during the task.",
        "Sent.",
        "count Percentage Identical sentences 43 21.5% Clear win of RBMT 10 5% Clear win of SMT 59 29.5% Win by voting RBMT 23 11.5% Win by voting SMT 62 31% Draw 3 1.5% Total 200 100% Table 1: Evaluation of results The rows of Table 1 marked as Clear win of one of the systems represent the sentences where none of the evaluators marked the other system as the better one.",
        "Win by voting does not distinguish how many evaluators were against the system marked by the majority as being the better of the two.",
        "The 3 sentences in the Draw row represent the cases when 1 or 3 evaluators mistakenly marked the pair of translations as being identical and there was no majority among the remaining ones.",
        "The results clearly indicate that the quality of Google Translate is better, although it clearly dominates in less than one third of translations.",
        "The large number of identical sentences also means that although ?",
        "Ces?",
        "?lko produced only 5% of translations which were clearly better than those of Google, it reached absolutely identical quality of translation in yet another 21.5%.",
        "This actually means that the top quality translations have been achieved in 26.5% by ?",
        "Ces?",
        "?lko and in 51% by Google Translate.",
        "According to our opinion, this ratio (approximately 2:1 in favor of the SMT approach) more realistically describes the difference in quality than the ratio of clear wins (approx.",
        "6:1 for Google Translate).",
        "5.1 Errors This section presents the most obvious errors detected in the evaluation of both systems.",
        "First of all, before we?ll look at individual types of errors of both systems, it is necessary to mention one very surprising fact concerning the translations.",
        "Although we have expected substantial differences between the corresponding sentences, the translations produced by both systems are surprisingly sim-ilar, 21.5% of them being absolutely identical.",
        "On top of that, when we have compared the first 100 translated sentences, we have discovered that the edit distance between the two sets is only 493 elementary operations.",
        "Given that the translations produced by Google Translate contain 9.653 characters in the first 100 sentences of the test set, this actually represents only about 5% difference.",
        "This looks much more like the results of two variants of the same system than the results of two different systems based upon two completely different paradigms.",
        "Because no details about the Google translate for this language pair have been published, it is impossible to judge the reasons for such a similarity.",
        "The following example demonstrates this similarity, it represents quite typical example of a long sentence with very few differences between both translations.",
        "Errors in translations are stressed by a bold font.",
        "Example 1.",

        "The same incorrect translations appeared also in different contexts in other sentences of the test corpus.",
        "Morphological errors Both languages are very similar also with regard to the number of inflected word forms derived from one lemma.",
        "This property seems to cause certain problems to both systems, as we can see in the Example 5, where both systems use an incorrect (but different) form of the same adjective.",
        "It is interesting that in this specific case the correct translation actually means no translation at all because the correct Czech and Slovak forms are identical in this context.",
        "Example 5.",

        "English translation: In March, Malaysian Airlines lost Boeing 777 with 239 people on board, which got lost from air radars on the way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.",
        "Although the morphological errors have a negative influence on automatic measures like BLEU or NIST (incorrect form of a correct word influences the score to the same extent as completely incorrect word), they usually do not change the meaning of the translated sentence and the speakers of the target language can easily reconstruct their correct form and understand the translation.",
        "From this point of view both systems perform very well because the relatively low number of incorrect word forms produced by both systems doesn't reach the threshold when the sentence as a whole would be unintelligible.",
        "Word order Both systems follow very strictly the order of words 96 of source sentences.",
        "This is not surprising in the case of the RBMT system, because its simple architecture is exploiting the fact that the word order of both languages is extremely similar.",

        "The strict correspondence of the word order of source and target sentences is a bit more surprising in the case of the SMT system, whose language model is probably based on a large volume of texts with a wide variety of word order variants.",
        "Czech and Slovak languages both have very few restrictions on the order of words and thus we have supposed that the translated sentences might have an altered word order compared to the source sentences.",
        "The only difference in the order of words appeared in the sentence presented below, where the RBMT system followed the original word order strictly, while the SMT system made changes (ac- ceptable ones) to the order of clitics.",

        "Syntactic errors There are no errors which could be classified as purely violating the syntax of the target language.",
        "The use of an incorrect form of direct or indirect object can be attributed to the category of morphological errors, because neither of the two systems deals with syntax directly.",
        "The RBMT system ignores syntax on the basis of the fact that both languages are syntactically very similar; the SMT system probably primarily relies on phrases discovered in large volumes of training data and thus it takes the syntactic rules into account only indirectly.",
        "Errors in meaning There were very few errors in incorrectly translated meaning of the source sentence into the target one.",
        "Although some SMT systems are infamous for issues related to the preservation of negated expressions, the only two examples of such errors were produced by the RBMT system in our tests.",
