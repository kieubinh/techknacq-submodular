        "Based on spatial linguistic cues in the user utterance (e.g. to my right, on the left), a 2D scoring function is selected to identify areas where the target POI is likely to be.",
        "This function takes into account the position of the POI relative to the car, as well as driver head pose.",
        "Scores for all candidate POIs are calculated.",
        "3) Posterior probabilities of each POI are calculated using the score of step 2 as prior, and non-spatial linguistic information (e.g. POI categories, building properties) as observations.",
        "This posterior calculation is computed using our Bayesian belief tracker called DPOT (Raux and Ma, 2011).",
        "The details are explained in Section 4.",
        "System hardware consists of a 3D depth sensor (Primesense Carmine 1.09), a USB GPS (BU- 353S4), an IMU sensor (3DM-GX3-25) and a close talk microphone (plantronics Voyage Leg-1 We do not deal with issues in language understanding related to dialog history and query type.",

        "3 Data Collection and Analysis 3.1 Collection Setting We collected data using a test route.",
        "The route passes through downtown Mountain View 2 and residential area around Honda Research Institute.",
        "We manually constructed our database containing 250 POIs (businesses such as restaurants, compa-nies) in this area.",
        "Each database entry (POI) has name, geo-location, category and property information explained in Section 3.4.",

        "It takes about 30 minutes to drive the route.",
        "The major difference between residential area and downtown is the POI density.",
        "While each POI in downtown has on average 7.2 other POIs within 50 meters, in residential area POIs have only 1.9 neighbors.",
        "Speed limits also differ between the two (35 mi/h vs 25 mi/h).",
        "We collected data from 14 subjects.",
        "They were asked to drive the test route and make queries about surrounding businesses.",
        "We showed a demo video 3 of the system to the users before starting the data collection.",
        "We also told them that the objective is a data collection for a situated spoken dialog system, rather than the evaluation of the whole system.",
        "We asked subjects to include the full description of the target POI within a single utterance to avoid queries whose understanding requires dialog history information 4 .",
        "Although the system answered based on the baseline strategy explained in Section 4.1, we asked subjects to ignore the system responses.",
        "As a result, we collected 399 queries with a valid target POI.",
        "Queries about businesses that do 2 We assumed that a POI is in downtown when it is located within the rectangle by geo-location coordinates (37.3902, - 122.0827) and (37.3954, -122.0760).",

        "We can also see that the POI position distribution has a large standard deviation.",
        "This is partly because the route has multiple sites from downtown and residential area.",
        "Interestingly, while the average distance to the target POI in downtown is 37.0 meters, that of residential area is 57.4 meters.",
        "We also analyze the relation between face direction and POI positions.",
        "Figure 4 plots the relation between the axial distance and the angular difference ?",
        "(between the user face direction and the target POI direction) (cf.",
        "Figure 2).",
        "The scatter plot suggests that the angular differences for distant target POIs is often small.",
        "For close target POIs the angular differences are larger and have a large variance 6 .",
        "3.3 Analysis of Timing Referring expressions such as ?the building on the right?",
        "must be resolved with respect to the context in which the user intended.",
        "However, in a moving car, such a context (i.e. the position of the car and the situation in the surroundings) can be very different between the time when the user starts speaking the sentence and the time they finish speaking it.",
        "Therefore, situated understanding must be very time sensitive.",
        "To confirm and investigate this issue, we analyze the difference in the POI positions between the time the ASR result is output vs the time the user actually started speaking.",
        "The hypothesis is 6 We will discuss the reason for this in Section 6.2.",
        "Table 3: User-provided linguistic cues Category of linguistic cue Percentage used (%) Relative position to the car (right/left) 59.4 Business category (e.g. restaurant, cafe) 31.8 Color of the POI (e.g. green, yellow) 12.8 Cuisine (e.g. Chinese, Japanese, Mexican) 8.3 Equipments (e.g. awning, outside seating) 7.2 Relative position to the road (e.g. corner) 6.5 that the latter yields a more accurate context in which to interpret the user sentence.",
        "In contrast, our baseline system uses the more straightforward approach of resolving expressions using the context at the time of resolution, i.e. whenever the ASR/NLU has finished processing an utterance (hereafter ?ASR results timing?).",
        "Specifically, we compare the average axial distance to the target POIs and its standard deviation between these two timings.",
        "Table 2 lists these figures broken down by position cue types and sites.",
        "The average axial distance from the car to the target POIs is often small at the ASR result timing, but the standard deviation is generally small at the start-of-speech timing.",
        "This indicates that the target POI positions at the start-of-speech timing is more consistent across users and sentence lengths than that at the ASR result timing.",
        "This result indicates the presence of a better POI likelihood function using the context (i.e. car position and orien-tation) at the start-of-speech timing than using the ASR result timing.",
        "3.4 Analysis of Linguistic Cues We then analyze the linguistic cues provided by the users.",
        "Here, we focus on objective and stable cues.",
        "We exclude subjective cues (e.g. big, beautiful, colorful) and cues that might change in a short period of time (e.g. with a woman dressed in green in front).",
        "We have categorized the linguistic cues used to describe the target POIs.",
        "Table 3 lists the cue types and the percentage of user utterances containing each cue type.",
        "The cues that the users most often provided concern POI position related to the car (right and left).",
        "Nearly 60% of queries included this type of cue and every subject provided it at least once.",
        "The second most frequent cue is category of business, especially in downtown.",
        "Users also provided col-25 ors of POIs.",
        "Other cues include cuisine, equip-ments, relative position to the road (e.g. on the corner).",
        "Another interesting finding from the analysis is that the users provided more linguistic cues with increasing candidate POIs in their field of view.",
        "Actually, the users provided 1.51 categories in average per query in downtown, while they provided 1.03 categories in residential area.",
        "(cf. POI density in Section 3.2: 7.2 vs 1.9) This indicates that users provide cues considering environment complexity.",
        "4 Methods for Situated Language Understanding 4.1 Baseline Strategy We use our previous version (Misu et al., 2013) as the baseline system for situated language understanding.",
        "The baseline strategy consists of the following three paragraphs, which correspond to the process 1)-3) in Section 2 and Figure 1.",
        "The system makes a POI look-up based on the geo-location information at the time ASR result is obtained.",
        "The search range of candidate POIs is within the range (relative geo-location of POIs against the car location) of -50 to 200 meters in the travelling direction and 100 meters to the left and 100 meters to the right in the lateral direction.",
        "The ASR result timing is also used to measure the distances to the candidate POIs.",
        "POI priors are calculated based on the distance from the car (= axial distance) based on ?the closer to the car the likely?",
        "principle.",
        "We use a likelihood function inversely proportional to the distance.",
        "We use position cues simply to remove POIs from a list of candidates.",
        "For example ?right?",
        "position cue is used to remove candidate POIs that are located on< 0 position in the lateral distance.",
        "When no right/left cue is provided, POIs outside of 45 degrees from the face direction are removed from the list of candidates.",
        "No linguistic cues except right/left are used to calculate POI posterior probabilities.",
        "So, the system selects the POI with the highest prior (POI score) as the language understanding result.",

        "Because the standard deviations of the POI distances are small (cf. Section 3.2), we expect that a better POI probability score estimation with the POI positions at this timing in the subsequent processes than the positions at the ASR result timing.",
        "The POI look-up range is the same as the baseline.",
        "We apply Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with diagonal covariance matrices over the input parameter space.",
        "The POI probability (prior) is calculated based on these Gaussians.",
        "We use two input parameters of the lateral and axial distances for queries with right/left cue, and three parameters of the lateral and axial distances and the difference in degree between the target and head pose directions for queries without right/left cue.",
        "(The effect of the parameters is discussed later in Section 6.2.)",
        "We empirically set the number of Gaussian components to 2.",
        "An example GMM fitting to the POI positions for queries with right and left cues is illustrated in Figures 5.",
        "The center of ellipse is the mean of the Gaussian.",
        "We use the five linguistic cue categories of Section 3.4 for the posterior calculation by the belief tracker.",
        "In the following experiments, we use either 1 or 0 as a likelihood of natural language understanding (NLU) observation.",
        "The likelihood for the category value is 1 if a user query (NLU result) contains the target value, otherwise 0.",
        "This corresponds to a strategy of simply removing candidate POIs that do not have the category values specified by the user.",

        "More than half of the errors are due to reference ambiguity.",
        "These errors are expected to be resolved through clarification dialogs.",
        "(e.g. asking user ?Did you mean the one in front or back??)",
        "Linguistic errors might be partly resolved by using a better database with detailed category information.",
        "For dynamic references and subjective cues, use of image processing techniques will help.",

        "Because other categories (e.g. color) are not readily available in a public POI database (e.g. Google Places API, Yelp API), we can obtain reasonable performance without using a special database or 9 Note that, we first determine the function to calculate POI scores (priors) based on the position cues, then calculate scores with the selected function.",
        "Table 6: Effect of linguistic cues linguistic cue Success category used rate (%) No linguistic cues (*) 50.6 (*) + Business category (e.g. cafe) 59.1 (*) + Color of the POI (e.g. green) 57.6 (*) + Cuisine (e.g. Chinese) 54.1 (*) + Equipments (e.g. awning) 53.9 (*) + Relative position (e.g. corner) 51.4 image processing.",
        "We also found that linguistic cues were especially effective in downtown.",
        "Actually, while the improvement 10 was 20.0% in downtown that for residential area was 14.4%.",
        "This mainly would be because the users provided more linguistic cues in downtown considering the difficulty of the task.",
        "6.4 Using Speech Recognition Results We evaluate the degradation by using automatic speech recognition (ASR) results.",
        "We use Google ASR 11 and Julius (Kawahara et al., 2004) speech recognition system with a language model trained from 38K example sentences generated from a grammar.",
        "An acoustic model trained from the WSJ speech corpus is used.",
        "Note that they are not necessarily the best system for this domain.",
        "Google ASR uses a general language model for dictation and Julius uses a mismatched acoustic model in terms of the noise condition.",
        "The query success rate was 56.3% for Julius and 60.3% for Google ASR.",
        "We got ASR accuracies of 77.9% and 80.4% respectively.",
        "We believe the performance will improve when N-best hypotheses with confidence scores are used in the posterior calculating using the belief tracker.",
        "7 Discussion The main limitation of this work comes from the small amount of data that we were able to collect.",
        "It is not clear how the results obtained here would generalize to other sites, POI density, velocities and sensor performances.",
        "Also, results might depend on experimental conditions, such as weather, hour, season.",
        "Hyper-parameters such as the optimal number of Gaussian components might have to be adapted to different situations.",
        "We therefore acknowledge that the scenes we experimented are only a limited cases of daily driving activities.",
        "10 1) + 2) vs 1) + 2) + 3).",
        "11 Although it is not realistic to use cloud-based speech recognition system considering the current latency, we use this as a reference system.",
        "28 However, the methods we propose are general and our findings should be verifiable without loss of generality by collecting more data and using more input parameters (e.g. velocity) for the POI prior calculation.",
        "In addition, much future work remains to realize a natural interaction with the system, such as taking into account dialog history and selecting optimal system responses.",
        "On the other hand, we believe this is one of the best platform to investigate situated interactions.",
        "The major topics that we are going to tackle are: 1.",
        "Dialog strategy: Dialog strategy and system prompt generation for situated environments are important research topics, especially to clarify the target when there is ambiguity as mentioned in Section 6.1.",
        "The topic will include an adaptation of system utterances (en- trainment) to the user (Hu et al., 2014).",
        "2.",
        "Eye tracker: Although we believe head pose is good enough to estimate user intentions because we are trained to move the head in driving schools to look around to confirm safety, we would like to confirm the difference in this task between face direction and eye-gaze.",
        "3.",
        "POI identification using face direction trajec-tory: Our analysis showed that the use of face direction sometimes degrades the POI identification performance.",
        "However, we believe that using a trajectory of face direction will change the result.",
        "4.",
        "Database: We assumed a clean and perfect database but we are going to evaluate the performance when noisy database is used.",

        "While the above studies have handled timing focusing on (para-)linguistic aspect, our work handles timing issues in relation to the user's physical surroundings.",
        "Recent advancements in gaze and face direction estimation have led to better user behavior understanding.",
        "There are a number of studies that have analyzed relationship between gaze and user in-tention, such as user focus (Yonetani et al., 2010), preference (Kayama et al., 2010), and reference expression understanding (Koller et al., 2012), between gaze and turn-taking (Jokinen et al., 2010; Kawahara, 2012).",
        "Nakano et al. (2013) used face direction for addressee identification.",
        "The previous studies most related to ours are reference resolution methods by Chai and Prasov (2010), Iida et al. (2011) and Kennington et al. (2013).",
        "They confirmed that the system's reference resolution performance is enhanced by taking the user's eye fixation into account.",
        "However, their results are not directly applied to an interaction in a rapidly changing environment while driving, where eye fixations are unusual activities.",

        "We focused on issues in understanding user language of timing, spatial distance, and linguistic cues.",
        "Based on the analysis of the collected user utterances, we proposed methods of using start-of-speech timing for the POI prior calcu-lation, GMM-based POI probability (prior) calcu-lation, and linguistic cues for the posterior calculation to improve the accuracy of situated language understanding.",
        "The effectiveness of the proposed methods was confirmed by achieving a significant improvement in a POI identification task.",
