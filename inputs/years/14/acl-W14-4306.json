        "This paper explores dialogue adaptation over repeated interactions within a task-oriented human tutorial dialogue corpus.",
        "We hypothesize that over the course of four tutorial dialogue sessions, tutors adapt their strategies based on the personality of the student, and in particular to student introversion or extraversion.",
        "We model changes in strategy over time and use them to predict how effectively the tutorial interactions support student learning.",
        "The results suggest that students leaning toward introversion learn more effectively with a minimal amount of interruption during task activity, but occasionally require a tutor prompt before voicing uncertainty; on the other hand, students tending toward extraversion benefit significantly from increased interaction, particularly through tutor prompts for reflection on task activity.",
        "This line of investigation will inform the development of future user-adaptive dialogue systems."

        "Throughout dialogue interactions, humans adapt to each other in a variety of ways (Cohen et al., 1981; Power, 1974; Wahlster and Kobsa, 1989).",
        "Some recent studies suggest that dialogue systems that mirror these adaptations to the user, e.g., by adopting the user's vocabulary (Niederhoffer and Pennebaker, 2002) or linguistically aligning to the user's context (Pickering and Garrod, 2004), may be more effective than those that do not.",
        "For supporting human dialogue, it has been demonstrated that tutorial dialogue systems improve in effectiveness when they adapt to user uncertainty (Forbes- Riley and Litman, 2007) or perform ?small talk?",
        "to increase the user's trust in the system (Cassell and Bickmore, 2003).",
        "Some studies have provided evidence that adapting to the user at the personality level also increases effectiveness; for exam-ple, users may become more agreeable when systems mirror their personality (Reeves and Nass, 1997), and varying levels of encouragement may help users of extraverted or introverted personalities accomplish a task more effectively (Tapus and Mataric, 2008).",
        "With this substantial evidence that adapting to user personality may improve the effectiveness of a dialogue system, there is little investigation of how personality affects repeated interactions.",
        "For supporting human learning in particular, we hypothesize that taking personality into account may enhance outcomes by providing a more tailored experience.",
        "To explore this hypothesis, this paper presents an analysis that uses the change in human tutorial dialogue policies over repeated interaction with introverted and extraverted students to predict the effectiveness of the tutoring.",
        "We utilize a widely-used and validated questionnaire, the Big Five Inventory, to determine a personality profile for each student.",
        "We hypothesize that introverted and extraverted students learn more effectively under different dialogue policies.",
        "The results suggest dialogue policy progressions that could aid in the future development of personality-based user-adaptive tutorial dialogue systems.",
        "2 Related Work Humans adapt to their dialogue partner in a variety of ways: for example, using knowledge acquired through the dialogue to inform subsequent utterances (Carberry, 1989), maintaining a set of subdialogues (Litman and Allen, 1987), and structuring dialogue to achieve a common goal (Power, 1974), including asking particular sorts of questions (Cohen et al., 1981), reaching dialogue convergence (Mitchell et al., 2012), and understanding context-specific vocabulary (Grosz, 1983).",
        "It 41 has been strongly suggested by a number of studies that dialogue systems would benefit greatly from mirroring this sort of adaptation, e.g., by adopting the user's syntax (Niederhoffer and Pen-nebaker, 2002), goal-oriented language (Brennan, 1996), and dialogue structure (Levelt and Kelter, 1982).",
        "Some of these factors have been successfully applied to task-oriented dialogue systems.",
        "For example, ?entrainment?",
        "(the alignment between partners at various linguistic levels) has been shown to be predictive of task success in telephone conversation (Nenkova et al., 2008) and of less misunderstanding in personality-matching systems (Mairesse and Walker, 2010).",
        "In order to gauge user personality, we utilize the Big Five Factor model, which was developed to objectively measure five particular aspects of a person's personality (Goldberg, 1993).",
        "This personality model has been widely implemented in a number of studies of personality in dialogue sys-tems, including recommender systems (Dunn et al., 2009) and conversational systems (Mairesse and Walker, 2010).",
        "The investigation of personality as it pertains to tutorial dialogue systems is a natural step for user-adaptive dialogue systems.",
        "3 Tutorial Dialogue Corpus The corpus under examination in this study consists of computer-mediated human-human textual dialogue (Mitchell et al., 2013; Ha et al., 2013).",
        "For each dialogue session, participants included one tutor and one student who cooperated with the goal of creating a working software artifact, a text-based adventure game, by the end of the repeated interactions.",
        "Students were first-year university students from an introductory engineering course who volunteered in exchange for course credit.",
        "No previous computer science knowledge was assumed or required.",
        "The tutors were primarily graduate students with previous experience in tutoring or teaching Java programming.",
        "The tutorial sessions were conducted within a web-based textual dialogue interface for introductory programming in Java.",
        "The tutorial dialogue interface, displayed in Figure 1, consists of four panes in which the student interacts: the task de-scription, the compilation and execution output, the student's Java source code, and the textual dialogue messages between the tutor and the student.",
        "The student could modify, compile, and ex-Figure 1: The task-oriented tutorial dialogue interface.",
        "ecute Java code from within the interface, in addition to conversing with the tutor via the textual dialogue pane.",
        "The content of the interface was synchronized in real time between the student and the tutor; however, the tutor's interactions with the environment were constrained to the textual dialogue with the student and the progression between tasks.",
        "The corpus was collected during two university semesters in Fall 2011 and Spring 2012.",
        "A total of N = 67 students interacted with one of seven tutors to complete the series of interactions during this time frame.",
        "The tutoring curriculum was composed of six task-based lessons completed over four weeks, each constrained to forty minutes in duration.",
        "Each lesson consisted of multiple sub-tasks, with each lesson concluding at a milestone.",
        "This paper considers only the first four of the six lessons, because the fifth lesson suffered from significant data loss due to a database connectivity error, and the sixth lesson consisted of an unstructured review of the previous five lessons, and is therefore a different type of dialogue than the prior lessons.",
        "The structure of the corpus is illustrated in Table 1.",
        "The sessions under consideration contained 67 students, with a total of 45, 904 utterances: 13, 732 student utterances and 32, 172 tutor utterances.",
        "There were an average of 117 utterances per session: 82 tutor utterances (652 words) and 35 student utterances (184 words).",
        "Introverted students averaged 36 utterances and 172 words per session, while extraverted students averaged 34 utterances and 187 words per session.",

        "The average pretest and posttest scores for students scoring above and below the median extraversion score in the four lessons are detailed in Table 3 (determination of extraversion is detailed in Section 3.2).",
        "There was no statistically significant difference between the scores of extraverted and introverted students.",

        "The standard method of testing for the Big Five personality traits is by questionnaire (John and Srivastava, 1999; Gosling et al., 2003).",
        "The students under consideration in this study were administered a Big Five Inventory survey, a type of self-assessment of personality, prior to any interaction with the tutorial dialogue system.",
        "The Big Five Inventory consists of 44 items to measure an individual on the Big Five Factors of per-sonality: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraver-sion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (Goldberg, 1993).",
        "This study focuses on a student's responses to the items reflective of extraversion and introversion.",
        "These items are identified in Table 4.",
        "Extraversion is defined as the part of the Big Five Factors that identifies gregariousness, assertive-ness, activity, excitement-seeking, positive emo-tions, and warmth (John and Srivastava, 1999).",

        "46 Several tutorial dialogue policy progressions were identified as statistically significantly associated with learning gain in both extraverted and introverted students.",
        "An increase in factual questions following extra-domain statements was associated with increased learning in students scoring above the median in extraversion, as was an increase in evaluative questions after explanations, an increase in the number of factual questions following information questions, and an increase in probing questions initiated after the conclusion of a sub-dialogue.",
        "On the other hand, extraverted students achieved a lower learning gain when tutors offered increasing reassurance after yes/no an-swers, asked more open questions after answers to WH-questions, or gave increasing instruction after an information question.",
        "A similar number of tutorial dialogue policy progressions were identified as statistically significantly correlated with learning gain in introverted students.",
        "For these students, a higher learning gain was achieved when tutors followed more information questions with a probing question, more yes/no answers with a prompt for questions, or offered increasing explanation after acknowledgements.",
        "Students scoring below the median in extraversion achieved a lower learning gain when tutors offered more reassurance after information questions, more prompts for questions after information questions, or increasing elaborated positive feedback after pauses in the dialogue.",
        "5 Discussion This section examines the tutorial dialogue policy progressions that were identified as statistically significant to learning gain in these groups of students; recall that each feature represents a change over time in the probability that the second dialogue act follows the first.",
        "First we examine the extraverted student model, and then we examine the introverted student model.",
        "Dialogue excerpts illustrating these dialogue interactions are displayed in Appendix 1.",
        "5.1 Extraverted Students Students scoring higher in extraversion tend to be assertive, outgoing, and energetic (Goldberg, 1993).",
        "As the models show, these characteristics likely influence the extent to which particular dialogue policies are effective for supporting learning for extraverted students.",
        "For example, the high energy nature of the extraversion personality trait may influence how dialogues transition.",
        "The model shows that students learned more when tutors progressed over time toward more positive feedback following extra-domain statements (Extra-Domain Statement S ?",
        "Positive Feedback T ) and toward more probing questions following pauses (Wait ?",
        "Probing Question T ).",
        "Both of these bigrams indicate important transition points within dialogue.",
        "For the former, extra-domain statements represent off-topic utterances, whereas tutor positive feedback can only be task-related (if it were a positive response to an extra-domain statement, the response would also have been tagged extra-domain).",
        "For tutor probing questions following pauses, it is likely that extraverted students benefited from this adaptation over time because in being asked to reflect and explain their current understanding or goals, they may have been re-engaged.",
        "It should be noted that in general, asking students to self-explain can support learning (VanLehn et al., 1992).",
        "Another example of a dialogue policy progression that emerged in the model and illustrates a widely known fact about tutoring is reflected in the Information Question S ?",
        "Information T bigram, which when tutors progressed more toward this approach, is associated with decreased learning.",
        "Our prior work has shown that directing students what to do, even if they have just asked for such direction, is strongly associated with decreased learning (Mitchell et al., 2013).",
        "Extraverted students tend to be assertive, and this characteristic influences how they make and interpret particular dialogue moves.",
        "An example of this can be seen within the model: when tutors progressed toward providing more reassurance after student yes/no answers, students learned less.",
        "This Yes/No Answer S ?",
        "Reassurance T policy is likely a form of indirect feedback or politeness, both of which have been shown to be unhelpful, and sometimes harmful, to learning (Johnson and Rizzo, 2004), and this seems to be a particularly marked effect for extraverted students who may benefit more from direct evaluations of their answers.",
        "Another example of this indirect approach may be within the WH-Question Answer S ?Open Question T tutor policy, whose increasing use over time was associated with lower student learning.",
        "Like reassurance, a follow-up question may be interpreted by extraverted students as an indirect in-47 dication that the previous answer was incorrect, and a more direct approach may have been more helpful.",
        "Finally, extraverted students tend to be talkative.",
        "This tendency is consistent with two of the model's findings regarding the helpfulness of particular types of tutor questions.",
        "Students tended to learn more when tutors progressed toward following student explanations with evaluative questions (Explanation S ?",
        "Evaluative Question T ).",
        "Although students?",
        "responses to evaluative questions (e.g., ?Do you understand??)",
        "are frequently considered to be inherently inaccurate, especially when students are first introduced to material, it may be the case that as students work on a task for an extended period of time, evaluative questions may become increasingly helpful.",
        "Another tutor questioning policy was also positively associated with learning gain for extraverted students: Information Question S ?",
        "Factual Question T involves the tutor answering a question with a question, potentially a very helpful strategy for talkative or highly social students.",
        "5.2 Introverted Students Students scoring lower in extraversion tend to be less talkative, more reserved, and more shy (Gold- berg, 1993).",
        "This may result in introverted students being less outspoken about their understand-ing, and less likely to ask questions about misunderstandings.",
        "These characteristics affect the way that tutor choices impact student learning during tutoring.",
        "For example, when less talkative students ask information questions and tutors tend to provide more reassurance as time goes on, this Information Question S ?",
        "Reassurance T pair is associated with decreased student learning.",
        "It is possible that since introverts are less likely to speak up with a question, the ?stakes?",
        "or importance of providing a direct answer may be higher for these students.",
        "Another dialogue policy progression that is not helpful for student learning is to provide elaborated positive feedback after a pause in dialogue (Wait ?",
        "Elaborated Positive Feedback T ).",
        "Because pauses in the dialogue typically correspond to student task actions, it is possible that introverted students who are on the right track would benefit more from the tutor allowing them to continue working.",
        "Introverted students also tend to describe themselves as shy or inhibited, which may be influential in the apparent helpfulness of tutors?",
        "increasing their question prompts following student answers (Answer Yes/No S ?",
        "Question Prompt T ).",
        "This could be due to the fact that introverted students are prone to giving terse responses, and may need extra encouragement to ask questions if they are uncertain.",
        "Increasing the number of these prompts could increase the likelihood that more of the stu-dent's questions are voiced.",
        "Another helpful type of question for introverted students seems to be probing questions, even when they follow a student question (Question Information S ?",
        "Probing Question T ).",
        "A probing question is an indirect request for reflection, prompting the student to reconsider her approach; this has previously been shown to have a positive effect on learning gain (VanLehn et al., 1992).",
        "6 Conclusion and Future Work Adapting to personality during dialogue may substantially improve the effectiveness of both human-human interactions as well as interactions with dialogue systems.",
        "We have investigated the ways in which human tutorial dialogue policy progressions are associated with learning within a repeated-interactions dialogue study.",
        "The models indicate that depending on a student's tendencies toward introversion or extraversion, different dialogue policy progressions support higher learning.",
        "In particular, introverts may benefit from additional prompting and encouragement to speak their mind, while extraverts may benefit from being given opportunities to discuss their thoughts with a tutor.",
        "While this study has focused on the extraversion facet of personality, future work may benefit from examining the other facets of the Big Five Fac-tors: Neuroticism, Openness, Conscientiousness, and Agreeableness.",
        "How we may best design a tutorial dialogue policy around a more fully-featured model of the student's personality is an important research area.",
        "It will also be important to examine task actions closely in future analyses, as this may have significant effects on task-oriented dialogue system design in particular.",
        "Additionally, analyz-ing the intermediate sessions in order to capture a fuller picture of the interaction over time is a promising direction.",
        "Finally, examining tutor personality may also reveal important insight for the design of tutorial systems.",
        "It is hoped that these lines of investigation will lead to a next generation 48 of user-adaptive dialogue systems with increased effectiveness facilitated by their adaptation to personality traits.",
