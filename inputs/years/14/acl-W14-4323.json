        "We describe an experiment where we annotate 50 personal narratives from weblogs and experiment with methods for achieving higher annotation reliability.",
        "We use the resulting annotated corpus to train a classifier to automatically identify narrative cat-egories, achieving a best average F-score of .658, which rises to an F-score of .767 on the cases with the highest annotator agreement.",

        "Sharing personal experiences by storytelling is a fundamental aspect of human social behavior (Fivush et al., 2005; Fivush and Nelson, 2004; Habermas and Bluck, 2000; Bamberg, 2006; Thorne, 2004; Bohanek et al., 2008; Thorne and Nam, 2009; McLean and Thorne, 2003; Pratt and Fiese, 2004).",
        "Humans appear to be wired to engage with information that is narratively structured (Gerrig, 1993; Bamberg, 2006; Bruner, 1991), and telling stories provides a critical developmental and societal function, by serving as a means to reinforce community value systems and to define individual identity (Thorne and Shapiro, 2011; Thorne et al., 2007).",
        "This has led some theorists to claim that ?the stories they tell?",
        "is the defining aspect of both individuals and cultures.",
        "Unlike any prior time in human history, personal narratives about many life experiences are being told online, and are widely available in social media sources such as weblogs.",
        "A personal narrative about an arrest is shown in Fig. 1, and one about a protest is in Fig. 4.",
        "Narratives such as these provide a valuable resource for learning a wealth of com-monsense knowledge about people, the types of activities they engage in, and the attitudes they hold.",
        "They are also well suited to learning about causal and temporal relationships between events because narrative interpretation explicitly depends on the coherence of these relationships (Graesser et al., 1994; Elson, 2012; Gordon et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2013).",
        "This paper applies and tests a narrative clause labeling scheme to personal narratives.",
        "Our scheme is derived from Labov & Waletzky's (henceforth L&W) theory of oral narrative (Labov, 1997; Labov and Waletzky, 1967).",
        "L&W's theory distinguishes (1) clauses that indicate causal relationships (AC- TION), from (2) clauses that provide traits or properties of the setting or characters (ORIENTATION), from (3) clauses describing the story characters?",
        "emotional reactions to the events (EVALUATION).",
        "We adopt L&W's theory for three reasons.",
        "First, we believe that the narrative structure of personal narratives posted on weblogs will be more similar to oral narrative than they are to classical stories.",
        "Second, we believe that any narrative discourse typology must at least distinguish ACTION, from ORI-ENTATION, and EVALUATION.",
        "Third, personal stories found on the web are often noisy and difficult to interpret; they do not always clearly follow well defined narrative conventions.",

        "However, acquiring this level of analysis on user generated content, such as blog sto-ries, is resource intensive.",
        "Research on computational models of narrative structure typically focus on inferring the causal and temporal relationships between events (Goyal et al., 2010; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009; Riaz and Girju, 2010; Beamer and Girju, 2009; Do et al., 2011; Manshadi et al., 2008; Gordon et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2013).",

        "In fact, L&W say that stories that are only about events are boring.",
        "Current methods for inferring narrative structure, including our own (Hu et al., 2013), do not distinguish event clauses from other narrative clause types.",

        "An orientation clause introduces the time and place of the events of the story, and identifies the participants of the story and their initial behavior.",
        "To properly understand narrative structure, orientations need to be identified as a separate type of utterance distinct from events.",
        "L&W define two other structural types called ABSTRACT and CODA.",
        "The ABSTRACT is an initial narrative clause summarizing the entire sequence of events.",
        "A CODA is final clause which returns the narrative to the time of speaking, indicating the end of the narrative.",
        "The CODA often provides the ?moral?",
        "of the story.",
        "The final element of a story according to L&W is EVALUATION, which L&W identify as essential to every story.",
        "According to L&W, evaluation gives the reason for telling the story, or the point of the story: without EVALUATION there is no story, merely a boring recitation of events.",
        "L&W state that the EVALUATION clauses may also provide information on the consequences of the events as they 172 relate to the goals and desires of the participants, and can be used to describe the events that did not occur, may have occurred, or could occur in the future in the story.",
        "Clauses 14-16 and 18 in Fig. 1 provide the narrator's evaluation of the transpiring events as well as introducing possible but unrealized alternative timelines.",
        "In theories of narrative identity (McAdams, 2003; Thorne, 2004), evaluation performs two additional functions: (1) it expresses the tellers opinion and in doing so reflects the value system of that person and their commu-nity; (2) it constructs and maintains relations between the teller and the listener.",
        "Clauses 20 and 22 illustrate these functions where the narrator directly reveals his affective response to the prior events.",
        "3 Dataset Corpus of Personal Stories.",
        "Previous work (Gor- don and Swanson, 2009) showed that about 5% of all weblog entries are personal stories describing an event in the author's daily life.",
        "They developed an automatic classifier for identifying personal narratives from a random sample of 5,000 posts from a corpus of 44 million entries available as part of the ICWSM 2010 dataset challenge (Burton et al., 2009).",

        "It is an open question what level of phrasal granularity is appropriate to apply to written narratives.",
        "Here, we treat each independent clause as the basic unit of discourse and manually segment each story in our dataset using this definition.",
        "This results in a collection of 1,602 independent clauses.",
        "We then divided the 50 stories into 4 groups and annotated them in batches among 3 annotators in order to refine our annotation guidelines and process.",
        "This dataset is freely available at https://nlds.soe.ucsc.edu/lw.",

        "We found at least 6 primary sources of disagreements: ?",
        "Clauses of more than one category are common with rising action and evaluation, e.g. a clause containing elements of orientation, action, and evaluation: After leaving the apartment at 6:45 AM, flying 2 hours, taking a cab to Seattle, and then driving seven hours up to Whistler including a border crossing, it's safe to say that I felt pretty much like a dick with legs.",

        "We refined these by examining L&W's descriptions of distinguishing features of each category.",
        "Table 2 summarizes the features we automatically extracted from all narrative clauses in the weblogs.",
        "First, we used the Stanford Parser to distinguish independent and dependent clauses and kept track separately of features that occurred in both types of clause.",
        "This is because L&W state that the unit of analysis should be an independent clause with its subordinate clauses, but we felt that these were exactly the cases that often caused difficulties during annotation.",
        "However distinguishing between the features occurring in the two clause types would allow us to determine if and when the features of the subordinate clause were relevant or more informative for automatic classification.",
        "Then, within both dependent and independent clauses, we distinguished the part-of-speech of the main verb (POS), whether the clause contained a negation (Negate), lexical semantic categories from LIWC (Pennebaker et al., 2001), dependency relations (DEP), lexical unigrams (STEM), and whether the verb was one of a class of verbs that are likely to be stative.",

        "The most common errors involved clauses with lexical INDICATORS that are highly correlated with one category, but in the context and interpretation of the story actually function as a different type.",
        "For example, unfortunately, could and n't are all strong indicators of evaluation, but in this case the primary function of the clause is to set the scene for the rest of the story, i.e., orientation.",
        "The interpretation of these clauses is clear to a human, despite the lexical items misleading the classifier.",
        "Another source of error is when the function of the clause in the narrative is ambiguous (PURPOSE in Table 8).",
        "While there may be some misleading lexical indicators in these clauses, there were often no strongly correlated words, such as the adjectives and modal verbs in EVALUATIONS.",
        "The distinction in these cases is that the primary function of the clause within the story is unclear, even to a human reader.",
        "Unsurprisingly, most of the examples in this category had low inter-rater agreement.",
        "Some of the clauses contain figurative language or complex constructions that require a significant amount of world knowledge and INFERENCE to interpret.",
        "For example, understanding the INFERENCE clause in Table 8 requires recognizing the metaphor about rabbit food in order to identify the subjective evaluation the narrator is making.",
        "There are also cases of clauses that contain MULTIPLE categories, at least partially because of the granularity of our segmentation.",

        "We also explicitly excluded the 7 clauses marked not part of the story.",
        "The types of errors described above are not mutually exclusive and in some cases are causally related.",
        "For example, the purpose of a clause may be ambiguous because it contains conflicting lexical indicators.",
        "Similarly, a clause containing multiple categories will likely have strong lexical indicators from each of these categories so that the classification algorithms cannot disambiguate among possible labels.",
        "This might be improved by more data, more sophisticated semantic features, or possibly an analysis focused on discourse relations, such as those in the PDTB (Louis et al., 2010; Prasad et al., 2008), or Elson's STORY INTENTION GRAPH (Rishes et al., 2013; Elson and McKeown, 2010; Elson, 2012).",

        "We show that we can automatically classify narrative clauses with these categories achieving an overall F-score of 0.689, which is substantially higher than a random (0.250) or majority class (0.437) baseline, which increases to an F-score of .767 on the cases where all three annotators agreed.",
        "The learning curves plotted in Fig. 2 clearly suggest that more training data would be beneficial before we investigate more complex features and learning algorithms.",
        "We believe the ability to automatically perform this type of simple narrative analysis will enable and improve many other types of deeper narrative understanding (Rahimtoroghi et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2013).",
        "For example, causal and temporal relationship extraction methods that focus only on clauses in the same action sequence be more accurate, because they exclude disconnected events from the orientation or evaluation sections.",
        "This type of analysis will also enable new methods for learning attitudes and values of societal groups based on the different affective evaluations that are provided in response to action clauses.",
        "Our results also highlight several properties of the data.",
        "Performance is different for results by story rather than over all clauses.",
        "This indicates that some stories are more difficult to classify than others and that ambiguous clauses are not uniformly distributed but are likely to be correlated with particular authors or writing styles.",
        "In other work, we have started to investigate whether we can automatically rate the temporal coherence of personal narratives (Ryan et al., 2014).",
        "We can use this to identify stories with utterances that are likely to be difficult to classify because of the poor quality of the narrative input.",
