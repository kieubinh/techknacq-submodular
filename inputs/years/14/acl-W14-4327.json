        "In this paper we re-examine the two classes of state of the art representa-tions: syntactic production rules and word pair features.",
        "In particular, we focus on the need to reduce sparsity in instance repre-sentation, demonstrating that different representation choices even for the same class of features may exacerbate sparsity issues and reduce performance.",
        "We present results that clearly reveal that lexicalization of the syntactic features is necessary for good performance.",
        "We introduce a novel, less sparse, syntactic representation which leads to improvement in discourse relation recognition.",
        "Finally, we demonstrate that classifiers trained on different repre-sentations, especially lexical ones, behave rather differently and thus could likely be combined in future systems."

        "Implicit discourse relations hold between adjacent sentences in the same paragraph, and are not signaled by any of the common explicit discourse connectives such as because, however, meanwhile, etc.",
        "Consider the two examples below, drawn from the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008), of a causal and a contrast relation, respectively.",
        "The italic and bold fonts mark the arguments of the relation, i.e the portions of the text connected by the discourse relation.",
        "Ex1: Mrs Yeargin is lying.",
        "[Implicit = BECAUSE] They found students in an advanced class a year earlier who said she gave them similar help.",
        "Ex2: Back downtown, the execs squeezed in a few meetings at the hotel before boarding the buses again.",
        "[Implicit = BUT] This time, it was for dinner and dancing a block away.",
        "The task is undisputedly hard, partly because it is hard to come up with intuitive feature representations for the problem.",
        "Lexical and syntactic features form the basis of the most successful studies on supervised prediction of implicit discourse relations in the PDTB.",
        "Lexical features were the focus of the earliest work in discourse recogni-tion, when cross product of words (word pairs) in the two spans connected via a discourse relation was studied.",
        "Later, grammatical productions were found to be more effective.",
        "Features of other classes such as verbs, inquirer tags, positions were also studied, but they only marginally improve upon syntactic features.",
        "In this study, we compare the most commonly used lexical and syntactic features.",
        "We show that representations that minimize sparsity issues are superior to their sparse counterparts, i.e. the better representations are those for which informative features occur in larger portions of the data.",
        "Not surprisingly, lexical features are more sparse (oc- curring in fewer instances in the dataset) than syntactic features; the superiority of syntactic representations may thus be partially explained by this property.",
        "More surprising findings come from a closer examination of instance representation approaches in prior work.",
        "We first discuss how choices in prior work have in fact exacerbated the sparsity problem of lexical features.",
        "Then, we introduce a new syntactically informed feature class, which is less sparse than prior lexical and syntactic fea-tures, and improves significantly the classification of implicit discourse relations.",
        "Given these findings, we address the question if any lexical information at all should be preserved in discourse parsers.",
        "We find that purely syntactic representations show lower recognition 199 for most relations, indicating that lexical features, albeit sparse, are necessary for the task.",
        "Lexical features also account for a high percentage of the most predictive features.",
        "We further quantify the agreement of predictions produced from classifiers using different instance representations.",
        "We find that our novel syntactic representation is better for implicit discourse relation prediction than prior syntactic feature because it has higher overall accuracy and makes correct predictions for instances for which the alternative representations are also correct.",
        "Different representation of lexical features however appear complementary to each other, with markedly higher fraction of instances recognized correctly by only one of the models.",
        "Our work advances the state of the art in implicit discourse recognition by clarifying the extent to which sparsity issues influence predictions, by introducing a strong syntactic representation and by documenting the need for further more complex integration of lexical information.",
        "2 The Penn Discourse Treebank The Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008) contains annotations for five types of discourse relations over the Penn Treebank corpus (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "Explicit relations are those signaled by a discourse connective that occurs in the text, such as ?because?, ?however?, -- for ex-ample?.",
        "Implicit relations are annotated between adjacent sentences in the same paragraph.",
        "There are no discourse connectives between the two sen-tences, and the annotators were asked to insert a connective while marking their senses.",
        "Some pairs of sentences do not contain one of the explicit discourse connectives, but the insertion of a connective provides redundant information into the text.",
        "For example, they may contain phrases such as ?the consequence of the act?.",
        "These are marked Alternative Lexicalizations (AltLex).",
        "Entity relations (EntRel) are adjacent sentences that are only related via the same entity or topic.",
        "Finally, sentences where no discourse relations were identified were marked NoRel.",
        "In this work, we consider AltLex to be part of the Implicit relations, and EntRel to be part of NoRel.",
        "All connectives, either explicit or implicitly in-serted, are associated with two arguments of the minimal span of text conveying the semantic content between which the relation holds.",
        "This is illustrated in the following example where the two arguments are marked in bold and italic: Ex: They stopped delivering junk mail.",
        "[Implicit = SO] Now thousands of mailers go straight into the trash.",
        "Relation senses in the PDTB are drawn from a 3-level hierarchy.",
        "The top level relations are Comparison (arg1 and arg2 holds a contrast rela-tion), Contingency (arg1 and arg2 are causally re-lated), Expansion (arg2 further describes arg1) and Temporal (arg1 and arg2 are temporally related).",
        "Some of the largest second-tier relations are under Expansion, which include Conjunction (arg2 provides new information to arg1), Instantiation (arg2 exemplifies arg1) and Restatement (arg2 semantically repeats arg1).",
        "In our experiments we use the four top level relations as well as the above three subclasses of Expansion.",
        "All of these subclasses occur with frequencies similar to those of the Contingency and Comparison classes, with thousands of examples in the PDTB.",
        "1 We show the distribution of the classes below: Temporal 1038 Comparison 2550 Contingency 4532 Instantiation 1483 Restatement 3271 Conjunction 3646 EntRel/NoRel 5464 3 Experimental settings In our experiments we use only lexical and syntactic features.",
        "This choice is motivated by the fact that lexical features have been used most widely for the task and that recent work has demonstrated that syntactic features are the single best type of representation.",
        "Adding additional features only minimally improves performance (Lin et al., 2009).",
        "By zeroing in only on these classes of features we are able to discuss more clearly the impact that different instance representation have on sparsity and classifier performance.",
        "We use gold-standard parses from the original Penn Treebank for syntax features.",
        "To ensure that our conclusions are based on analysis of the most common relations, we train binary SVM classifiers 2 for the seven relations described above.",
        "We adopt the standard practice in 1 All other sub-classes of implicit relations are too small for general practical applications.",
        "For example the Alternative class and Concession class have only 185 and 228 oc-currences, respectively, in the 16,224 implicit relation annotations of the PDTB.",
        "2 We use SVMLight (Joachims, 1999) with linear kernel.",
        "200 prior work and downsampled the negative class so the number of positive and negative samples are equal in the training set.",
        "3 Our training set consists of PDTB sections 219.",
        "The testing set consists of sections 20-24.",
        "Like most studies, we do not include sections 0-1 in the training set.",
        "We expanded the test set (sections 23 or 23-24) used in previous work (Lin et al., 2014; Park and Cardie, 2012) to ensure the number of examples of the smaller relations, particularly of Temporal or Instantiation, are suitable for carrying out reliable tests for statistical significance.",
        "Some of the discourse relations are much larger than others, so we report our results in term of F-measure for each relation and average unweighted accuracy.",
        "Significance tests over F scores were carried out using a paired t-test.",
        "To do this, the test set is randomly partitioned into ten groups.",
        "In each group, the relation distribution was kept as close as possible to the overall test set.",
        "4 Sparsity and pure lexical representations By far the most common features used for representing implicit discourse relations are lexical (Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008; Pitler et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2009; Hernault et al., 2010; Park and Cardie, 2012).",
        "Early studies have suggested that lexical features, word pairs (cross- product of the words in the first and second ar-gument) in particular, will be powerful predictors of discourse relations (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002; Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2007).",
        "The intuition behind word pairs was that semantic relations between the lexical items, such as drought?famine, child?adult, may in turn signal causal or contrast discourse relations.",
        "Later it has been shown that word pair features do not appear to capture such semantic relationship between words (Pitler et al., 2009) and that syntactic features lead to higher accuracies (Lin et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2010; Park and Cardie, 2012).",
        "Recently, Biran and McKeown (2013) aggregated word pair features with explicit connectives and reported improvements over the original word pairs as features.",
        "In this section, we show that the representation of lexical features play a direct role in feature sparsity and ultimately affects prediction performance.",
        "The first two studies that specifically addressed 3 We also did not include features that occurred less than 5 times in the training set.",

        "the problem of predicting implicit discourse relations in the PDTB made use of very different instance representations.",
        "Pitler et al. (2009) represent instances of discourse relations in a vector space defined by word pairs, i.e. the crossproduct of the words that appear in the two arguments of the relation.",
        "There, features are of the form (w 1 , w 2 ) where w 1 ?",
        "arg1 and w 2 ?",
        "arg2.",
        "If there are N words in the entire vocabulary, the size of each instance would be N ?N .",
        "In contrast, Lin et al. (2009) represent instances by tracking the occurrences of grammatical productions in the syntactic parse of argument spans.",
        "There are three indicator features associated with each production: whether the production appears in arg1, in arg2, and in both arguments.",
        "For a grammar with N production rules, the size of the vector representing an instance will be 3N .",
        "For convenience we call this ?binary representation?, in contrast to the word-pair features in which the cross product of words constitute the representation.",
        "Note that the cross-product approach has been extended to a wide variety of features (Pitler et al., 2009; Park and Cardie, 2012).",
        "In the experiments that follow we will demonstrate that binary representations lead to less sparse features and higher prediction accuracy.",
        "Lin et al. (2009) found that their syntactic features are more powerful than the word pair features.",
        "Here we show that the advantage comes not only from the inclusion of syntactic information but also from the less sparse instance representation they used for syntactic features.",
        "In Table 1 we show the number of features for each representation and the average F score and accuracy for word pairs and words with binary representation (binary-lexical).",
        "The results for each relation are shown in Table 8 and discussed in Section 7.",
        "Using binary representation for lexical information outperforms word pairs.",
        "Thus, the difference in how lexical information is represented accounts for a considerable portion of the improvement reported in Lin et al. (2009).",
        "Most notably, for the Instantiation class, we see a 7.7% increase in F-score.",
        "On average, the less sparse representation 201 translates into 2.34% absolute improvement in F-score and 3.2% absolute improvement in accuracy.",
        "From this point on we adopt the binary representation for the features discussed.",
        "5 Sparsity and syntactic features Grammatical production rules were first used for discourse relation representation in Lin et al. (2009).",
        "They were identified as the most suitable representation, that lead to highest performance in a couple of independent studies (Lin et al., 2009; Park and Cardie, 2012).",
        "The comparison representations covered a number of semantic classes related to sentiment, polarity and verb information and dependency representations of syntax.",
        "Production rules correspond to tree chunks in the constituency parse of a sentence, i.e. a node in the syntactic parse tree with all of its children, which in turn correspond to grammar rules applied in the derivation of the tree, such as S?NP VP.",
        "This syntactic representation subsumes lexical representations because of the production rules with part-of-speech on the left-hand side and a lexical item on the right-hand side.",
        "We propose that the sparsity of production rules can be reduced even further by introducing a new representation of the parse tree.",
        "Specifically, instead of having full production rules where a single feature records the parent and all its children, all (parent,child) pairs in the constituency parse tree are used.",
        "For example, the rule S?NP VP will now become two features, S?NP and S?VP.",
        "Note that the leaves of the tree, i.e. the part-of-speech?word features are not changed.",
        "For ease of reference we call this new representation ?pro- duction sticks?.",
        "In this section we show that F scores and accuracies for implicit discourse relation prediction based on production sticks is significantly higher than using full production rules.",
        "First, Table 2 illustrates the contrast in sparsity among the lexical, production rule and stick representations.",
        "The table gives the rate of occurrence of each feature class, which is defined as the average fraction of features with non-zero values in the representation of instances in the entire training set.",
        "Specifically, let N be the total number of features, m i be the number of features triggered in instance i, then the rate of occurrence is m i N .",

        "Sticks have almost twice the rate of occurrence of that of full production rules.",
        "Both syntactic representations have much larger rate of occurrence than lexical features, and the rate of occurrence of word pairs is more than twice smaller than that of the binary lexical representation.",
        "Next, in Table 3, we give binary classification prediction results based on both full rules and sticks.",
        "The first two rows of Table 3 compare full production rules (prodrules) with production sticks (sticks) using the binary representation.",
        "They both outperform the binary lexical representation.",
        "Again our results confirm that the better performance of production rule features is partly because they are less sparse than lexical represen-tations, with an average of 1.04% F-score increase.",
        "Individually the F scores of 6 of the 7 relations are improved as shown in Table 8.",
        "6 How important are lexical features?",
        "Production rules or sticks include lexical items with their part-of-speech tags.",

        "When lexical items are not included in the rep-resentation, the number of features is reduced to fewer than 30% of that in the original full production rules.",
        "At the same time however, including the lexical items in the representation improves performance even more than introducing the less sparse production stick representation.",
        "Production sticks with lexical information also perform better than the same representation without the POS-word sticks.",
        "The number of features and their rates of occurrences are listed in Table 5.",
