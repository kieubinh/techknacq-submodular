        "We study the design of an information retrieval (IR) system that assists customer service agents while they interact with end-users.",
        "The type of IR needed is difficult because of the large lexical gap between problems as described by cus-tomers, and solutions.",
        "We describe an approach that bridges this lexical gap by learning semantic relatedness using tensor representations.",
        "Queries that are short and vague, which are common in practice, result in a large number of documents being retrieved, and a high cognitive load for customer service agents.",
        "We show how to reduce this burden by providing suggestions that are selected based on the learned measures of semantic relatedness.",
        "Experiments show that the approach offers substantial benefit compared to the use of standard lexical similarity."

        "Information retrieval systems help businesses and individuals make decisions by automatically extracting actionable intelligence from large (un- structured) data (Musen et al., 2006; Antonio Palma-dos Reis, 1999).",
        "This paper focuses on the application of retrieval systems in a contact centers where the system assists agents while they are helping customers with problem resolution.",
        "Currently, most contact center information retrieval use (web based) front-ends to search engines indexed with knowledge sources (Holland, 2005).",
        "Agents enter queries to retrieve documents related to the customer's problem.",
        "These sources are often incomplete as it is unlikely that all possible customer problems can be identified before product release.",
        "This is particularly true for recently released and frequently updated products.",
        "One approach, which we build on here, is to mine problems and resolutions from online discussion forums Yahoo!",
        "Answers 1 Ubuntu Forums 2 and Apple Support Communities 3 .",
        "While these often provide useful solutions within hours or days of a problem surfacing, they are semantically noisy (Gangadharaiah and Narayanaswamy, 2013).",
        "Most contact centers and agents are evaluated based on the number of calls they handle over a period (Pinedo et al., 2000).",
        "As a result, queries entered by agents into the search engine are usually underspecified.",
        "This, together with noise in the database, results in a large number of documents being retrieved as relevant documents.",
        "This in turn, increases the cognitive load on agents, and reduces the effectiveness of the search system and the efficiency of the contact center.",
        "Our first task in this paper is to automatically make candidate suggestions that reduce the search space of relevant documents in a contact center application.",
        "The agent/user then interacts with the system by selecting one of the suggestions.",
        "This is used to expand the original query and the process can be repeated.",
        "We show that even one round of inter-action, with a small set of suggestions, can lead to high quality solutions to user problems.",
        "In query expansion, the classical approach is to automatically find suggestions either in the form of words, phrases or similar queries (Kelly et al., 2009; Feuer et al., 2007; Leung et al., 2008).",
        "These can be obtained either from query logs or based on their representativeness of the initial retrieved documents (Guo et al., 2008; Baeza-yates et al., 2004).",
        "The suggestions are then ranked either based on their frequencies or based on their similarity to the original query (Kelly et al., 2009; Leung et al., 2008).",
        "For example, if suggestions and queries are represented as term vectors (e.g. 1 http://answers.yahoo.com/ 2 http://ubuntuforums.org/ 3 https://discussions.apple.com/ 218 term frequency-inverse document frequency or tf-idf) their similarity may be determined using similarity measures such as cosine similarity or inverse of euclidean distance (Salton and McGill, 1983).",
        "However, in question-answering and problem-resolution domains, and in contrast to traditional Information Retrieval, most often the query and the suggestions do not have many overlapping words.",
        "This leads to low similarity scores, even when the suggestion is highly relevant.",
        "Consider the representative example in Table 1, taken from our crawled dataset.",
        "Although the suggestions, ?does not support file transfer?, ?connection not stable?, ?pairing failed?",
        "are highly relevant for the problem of ?Bluetooth not working?, their lexical similarity score is zero.",
        "The second task that this paper addresses is how to bridge this lexical chasm between the query and the suggestions.",
        "For this, we learn a measure of semantic-relatedness between the query and the suggestions rather than defining closeness based on lexical similarity.",
        "Query Bluetooth not working .",
        "Suggestions devices not discovered, bluetooth greyed out, bluetooth device did not respond, does not support file transfer, connection not stable, pairing failed Table 1: Suggestions for the Query or customer's problem, ?Bluetooth not working?.",
        "The primary contributions of this paper are that: ?",
        "We show how tensor methods can be used to learn measures of question-answer or problem-resolution similarity.",
        "In addition, we show that these learned measures can be used directly with well studied classification techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Logistic Classifiers to classify whether suggestions are relevant.",
        "This results in substantially improved performance over using conventional similarity metrics.",
        "?",
        "We show that along with the learned similarity metric, a data dependent Information Gain (which incorporates knowledge about the set of documents in the database) can be used as a feature to further boost accuracy.",
        "?",
        "We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a complete end-to-end problem-resolution system, which includes crawled data from online forums and gold standard user interaction annotations.",
        "2 System outline As discussed in the Introduction, online discussion forums form a rich source of problems and their corresponding resolutions.",
        "Thread initiators or users of a product facing problems with their product post in these forums.",
        "Other users post possible solutions to the problem.",
        "At the same time, there is noise due to unstructured content, off-topic replies and other factors.",
        "Our interaction system has two phases, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "The offline phase attempts to reduce noise in the database, while the online phase assists users deal with the cognitive overload caused by a large set of retrieved documents.",
        "In our paper, threads form the documents indexed by the system.",
        "The goals of the offline phase are two-fold.",
        "First, to reduce the aforementioned noise in the database, we succinctly represent each document (i.e., a thread in online discussion forums) by its signature, which is composed of units extracted from the first post of the underlying thread that best describe the problem discussed in the thread.",
        "Second, the system makes use of click-through data, where users clicked on relevant suggestions for their queries to build a relevancy model.",
        "As mentioned before, the primary challenge is to build a model that can identify units that are semantically similar to a given query.",
        "In the online phase, the agent who acts as the mediator between the user and the Search Engine enters the user?s/customer's query to retrieve relevant documents.",
        "From these retrieved documents, the system then obtains candidate suggestions and ranks these suggestions using the relevancy model built in the offline phase to further better understand the query and thereby reduce the space of documents retrieved.",
        "The user then selects the suggestion that is most relevant to his query.",
        "The retrieved documents are then filtered displaying only those documents that contain the selected suggestion in their signatures.",
        "The process continues until the user quits.",
        "2.1 Signatures of documents In the offline phase, every document (correspond- ing to a thread in online discussion forums) is represented by units that best describe a problem.",
        "We adopt the approach suggested in (Gangadhara- 219 iah and Narayanaswamy, 2013) to automatically generate these signatures from each discussion thread.",
        "We assume that the first post describes the user's problem, something we have found to be true in practice.",
        "From the dependency parse trees of the first posts, we extract three types of units (i) phrases (e.g., sync server), (ii) attribute-values (e.g., iOS, 4) and (iii) action-attribute tuples (e.g., sync server: failed).",
        "Phrases form good base problem descriptors.",
        "Attribute-value pairs provide configurational contexts to the problem.",
        "Action-attribute tuples, as suggested in (Gangadharaiah and Narayanaswamy, 2013), capture segments of the first post that indicate user wanting to perform an action (?I cannot hear notifications on blue-tooth?)",
        "or the problems caused by a user's action (?working great before I updated?).",
        "These make them particularly valuable features for problem-resolution and question-answering.",
        "2.2 Representation of Queries and Suggestions Queries are represented as term vectors using the term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf- idf) representation forming the query space.",
        "The term frequency is defined as the frequency with which word appears in the query and the inverse document frequency for a word is defined as the frequency of queries in which the word appeared.",
        "Similarly, units are represented as tf-idf term vectors from the suggestion space.",
        "Term frequency in the unit space is defined as the number of times a word appears in the unit and its inverse document frequency is defined in terms of the number of units in which the word appeared.",
        "Since the vocabulary used in the queries and documents are different, the representations for queries and units belong to different spaces of different dimensions.",
        "For every query-unit pair, we learn a measure of similarity as explained in Section 4.",
        "Addi-tionally, we use similarity features based on cosine similarity between the query and the unit under consideration.",
        "We also consider an additional feature based on information gain (Gangadhara- iah and Narayanaswamy, 2013).",
        "In particular, if S represents the set all retrieved documents, S 1 is a subset of S (S 1 ?",

        "(3) We crawled posts and threads from online forums for the products of interest, as detailed in Section 5.1, and these form the documents.",
        "We used trial interactions and retrievals to collect the click-though data, which we used as labeled data for similarity metric learning.",
        "In particular, labels indicate which candidate units were selected as relevant suggestions by a human annotator.",
        "We now explain our training (offline) and testing (online) phases that use this data in more detail.",
        "2.3 Training The labeled (click-through) data for training the relevance model is collected as follows.",
        "Annotators were given pairs of queries.",
        "Each pair is composed of an underspecified query and a specific query (Section 5.1 provides more information on the creation of these queries).",
        "An underspecified query is a query that reflects what a user/agent typically enters into the system, and the corresponding specific query is full-specified version of the underspecified query.",
        "Annotators were first asked to query the search engine with each underspecified query.",
        "We use the Lemur search engine (Strohman et al., 2004).",
        "From the resulting set of retrieved documents, the system uses the information gain criteria (as given in (1) below) to rank and display to the annotators the candidate suggestions (i.e., the units that appear in the signatures of the retrieved documents).",
        "Thus, our system is bootstrapped using the information gain criterion.",
        "The annotators then selects the candidate suggestion that is most relevant to the corresponding specific query.",
        "The interaction with the system continues until the annotators quit.",
        "We then provide a class label for each unit based on the collected click-through information.",

        "S(x) was clicked by a user for his query x, from the list S we provide a + label to indicate that the unit is relevant suggestion for the query.",

        "At each time step, our system proposes a list Z(x) of possible query refinement suggestions z to the user.",
        "The user can select one or none of these suggestions.",

        "Thus, if X is of order M X and W of order M W , A is of order M A = M X +M W .",
        "The particular tensor we are interested in is a 2-D tensor (matrix) X which is the outer product of query and unit pairs (Feats).",
        "In particular, for a query x and unit y, X i,j = x i y j .",
        "Given this representation, standard classification and regression methods from the machine learning literature can often be extended to deal with tensors.",

        "In particular, in our case we use different features to represent queries and units (as discussed in Section 2.2) which are not of the same length, and as a result trivially do not lie in the same space.",
        "Tensor methods also allow us to regularize the components of queries and units separately in different ways.",
        "This can be done for example by, i) forcing W = Q 1 Q 2 , where Q 1 and Q 2 are constrained to be of fixed rank s ii) using trace or Frobenius norms on Q 1 and Q 2 for separate regularization as proxies for the rank iii) using different sparsity promoting norms on the rows of Q 1 and Q 2 iv) weighing these penalties differently for the two matrices in the final loss function.",
        "Note that by analogy to the vector case, we directly obtain generalization error guarantees for our methods.",
        "We also discuss the advantage of the tensor representation above over a natural representation X = [x; y] i.e. X is the column vector obtained by stacking the query and unit representations.",
        "Note that in this representation, for logistic regres-sion, while a change in the query x can change the probability for a unit P (r(X) = 1) it cannot change the relative probability of two different units.",
        "Thus, the ordering of all unit remains the same for all queries.",
        "This flaw has been pointed out in the literature in (Vert and Jacob, 2008) and (Bai et al., 2009), but was brought to our attention by (Elkan, 2010).",
        "Finally, we note that by normalizing the query and unit vectors (x and y), and selecting W = I (the identity matrix) we can recover the cosine similarity metric (Elkan, 2010).",
        "Thus, our representation is atleast as accurate and we show that learning the diagonal and off-diagonal components of W can substantially improve accuracy.",
        "Additionally, for every (query,unit) we also compute information gain (IG) as given in (1), and the lexical similarity (Sim) in terms of cosine similarity between the query and the unit as additional features in the feature vectors.",

        "We then measured the relevance of the reduced result, with respect to the gold standard for that specific query, using metrics used in IR - MRR, Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Success at rank N. Figures 3, 4 and Table 3 evaluate the results obtained with the interaction engine using Feats-IG-Sim and Feats+IG+Sim.",
        "We compared the performance of our algorithms with a Baseline that does not perform any interaction and is evaluated based on the retrieved results obtained with the underspecified queries.",
        "The models for each of the systems were trained using query-suggestion pairs collected from 100 specific queries (data collected as explained in Section 2).",
        "The remaining 100 specific queries were used for testing.",
        "We see that the suggestions predicted by the classifiers using the relevancy model indeed improves the performance of the baseline.",
        "Also, adding the IG and Sim feature further boosts the performance of the system.",

        "(x, y) defined between any query-document pair.",
        "These features are then used, along with labeled training data, to learn the parameters of a model that can then be used to predict the relevance r(x, y) of a new query-document pair.",
        "The output of the model can also be used to re-rank the results of a search engine.",
        "In contrast to this class of methods, we define and parameterize the ?",
        "function and jointly optimize the parameters of the feature mapping and the machine learning re-ranking model.",
        "Latent tensor methods for regression and classification have recently become popular in the image and signal processing domain.",
        "Most of these methods solve an optimization problem similar to our own (9), but add additional constraints limiting the rank of the learned matrix W either explicitly or implicit by defining W = Q 1 Q T 2 , and defining Q 1 ?",
        "R d x ?d and Q 2 ?",
        "R d y ?d .",
        "This approach is used for example in (Pirsiavash et al., 2009) and more recently in (Tan et al., 2013) (Guo et al., 2012).",
        "While this reduces the number of parameters to be learned from d x d y to d(d x + d y ) it makes the problem non-convex and introduces an additional parameter d that must be selected.",
        "This approach of restricting the rank was recently suggested for information retrieval in (Wu et al., 2013).",
        "They look at a regression problem, using click-through rates as the reward function r(x, y).",
        "In addition, (Wu et al., 2013) does not use an initial search engine and hence must learn an affinity function between all query-document pairs.",
        "In contrast to this, we learn a classification function that discriminates between the true and false positive documents that are deemed similar 224 by the search engine.",
        "This has three beneficial effects : (i) it reduces the amount of labeled training data required and the imbalance between the positive and negative classes which can make learning difficult (He and Garcia, 2009) and (ii) allows us to build on the strengths of fast and strong existing search engines increasing accuracy and decreasing retrieval time and (iii) allows the learnt model to focus learning on the query-document pairs that are most problematic for the search engine.",
        "Bilinear forms of tensor models without the rank restriction have recently been studied for link prediction (Menon and Elkan, 2011) and image processing (Kobayashi and Otsu, 2012).",
        "Since the applications are different, there is no preliminary search engine which retrieves results, making them ranking methods and ours a re-ranking approach.",
        "Related work in text IR includes (Beefer- man and Berger, 2000), where two queries are considered semantically similar if their clicks lead to the same page.",
        "However, the probability that different queries lead to common clicks of the same URLs is very small, again increasing the training data required.",
        "Approaches in the past have also proposed techniques to automatically find suggestions either in the form of words, phrases (Kelly et al., 2009; Feuer et al., 2007; Baeza-yates et al., 2004) or similar queries (Leung et al., 2008) from query logs (Guo et al., 2008; Baeza-yates et al., 2004) or based on their probability of representing the initial retrieved documents (Kelly et al., 2009; Feuer et al., 2007).",
        "These suggestions are then ranked either based on their frequencies or based on their closeness to the query.",
        "Closeness is defined in terms of lexical similarity to the query.",
        "However, most often the query and the suggestions do not have any co-occurring words leading to low similarity scores, even when the suggestion is relevant.",
        "(Gangadharaiah and Narayanaswamy, 2013) use information gain to rank candidate suggestions.",
        "However, the relevancy of the suggestions highly depends on the relevancy of the initial retrieved documents.",
        "Our work here addresses the question of how to bridge this lexical chasm between the query and the suggestions.",
        "For this, we use semantic-relatedness between the query and the suggestions as a measure of closeness rather than defining closeness based on lexical similarity.",
        "A related approach to handle this lexical gap by applying alignment techniques from Statistical Machine translation (Brown et al., 1993), in particular by building translation models for information retrieval (Berger and Lafferty, 1999; Rie-zler et al., 2007).",
        "These approaches require training data in the form of question-answer pairs, are again limited to words or phrases and are not intended for understanding the user's problem better through interaction, which is our focus.",
        "6 Conclusions, Discussions and Future Work We studied the problem of designing Information Retrieval systems for interactive problem resolution.",
        "We developed a system for bridging the large lexical gap between short, incomplete problem queries and documents in a database of resolutions.",
        "We showed that tensor representations are a useful tool to learn measures of semantic relat-edness, beyond the cosine similarity metric.",
        "Our results show that with interaction, suggestions can be effective in pruning large sets of retrieved documents.",
        "We showed that our approach offers substantial improvement over systems that only use lexical similarities for retrieval and re-ranking, in an end-to-end problem-resolution domain.",
        "In addition to the classification losses considered in this paper, we can also use another loss term based on ideas from recommender systems, in particular (Menon and Elkan, 2011).",
        "Consider the matrix T with all training queries as rows and all units as the columns.",
        "If we view the query refinement problem as a matrix completion prob-lem, it is natural to assume that this matrix has low rank, so that T can be written as T = U?V T , where ?",
        "is a diagonal matrix and parameter of our optimization.",
        "These can then be incorporated into the training process by appropriate changes to the cost and regularization terms.",
        "Another benefit of the tensor representation is that it can easily be extended to incorporate other meta-information that may be available.",
        "For ex-ample, if context sensitive features, like the identity of the agent, are available these can be incorporated as another dimension in the tensor.",
        "While optimization over these higher dimensional tensors may be more computationally complex, the problems are still convex and can be solved efficiently.",
        "This is a direction of future research we are pursuing.",
        "Finally, exploring the power of information gain type features in larger database systems is of interest.",
