        "Spoken dialog systems, a field rapidly growing with the spread of smart mobile devices, has to deal with challenges to become a primary user interface for natural interaction using conversations.",
        "One of the challenges is to maintain the state of the dialog in the conversational process, which is called dialog state tracking.",
        "The dialog state encapsulates the information needed to successfully finish the dialog, such as users?",
        "goal or requests, and thus it is an essential entity in spoken dialog systems.",
        "However, the error incurred by Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) makes the true user utterance not directly observable, and this makes it difficult to figure out the true dialog state.",
        "Various methods have been used to construct dialog state trackers.",
        "The traditional methods used in most commercial systems use hand-crafted rules that typically rely on the most likely result from SLU.",
        "However, these rule-based systems are prone to frequent errors as the most likely result is not always correct.",
        "Hence, these systems often drive the users to respond using simple keywords and to explicitly confirm everything they say, which is far from a natural conversational interaction.",
        "An accurate tracking of the dialog state is crucial for natural and efficient dialogs.",
        "On the other hand, modern methods take a statistical approach to calculate the posterior distribution over the dialog states using multiple results from SLU in order to overcome the error in the most likely SLU result.",
        "Statistical dialog state trackers can be categorized into two approaches depending on how the posterior calculation is modeled.",
        "The generative approach uses the generative model that describes how the SLU results are generated from the hidden dialog state and uses the Bayes?",
        "rule to calculate the posterior.",
        "It has been a popular approach for statistical dialog state tracking, since it naturally fits into the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) (Williams and Young, 2007), an integrated model for dialog state tracking and dialog strategy optimization.",
        "In the POMDP point of view, the dialog state tracking is essentially belief monitoring, which is the task of calculating posterior distribution over the hidden state given the history of observations.",
        "Examples of the dialog state trackers that take the generative approach include (Young et al., 2010; Thomson and Young, 2010; Raux and Ma, 2011) On the other hand, the discriminative approach directly models the posterior distribution.",
        "Since it avoids modeling of unnecessary aspects of the task, it typically achieves a better tracking accuracy compared to the generative approach.",
        "Examples of discriminative dialog state trackers include (Lee, 2013; Metallinou et al., 2013).",
        "How-ever, their feature functions often refer to past ob-servations, and it remains yet to be seen whether 273 the discriminative approach can be successfully incorporated into POMDP or reinforcement learning (RL) for dialog strategy optimization.",
        "This paper is concerned with the generative approach to dialog state tracking.",
        "In our earlier work (Kim et al., 2013), the optimization of the tracker was carried out independently for each component model (observation model, user action model, and belief refinement model) that comprised our tracker.",
        "This was not exactly a proper way to train the tracker for overall performance optimization.",
        "In this paper, we present an optimization method, which we call ?cascading gradient descent?, that trains component models simultaneously.",
        "We show that this approach yields a dialog state tracker that performs on par with the best ones that participated in the second Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC2).",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: We briefly review the background of our work in section 2, and present our method in section 3.",
        "We then explain the DSTC2 dialog domain and the experimental settings in section 4, and discuss the results in section 5.",
        "Finally, we conclude the paper with the summary and the suggestion for future work in section 6.",
        "2 Background and Related Work The dialog state tracking is formalized as fol-lows: In each turn of the dialog, the spoken dialog system executes system action a, and the user with goal g responds to the system with utterance u.",

        "This is not feasible for real dialog domains that have a large number of user goals (the DSTC2 dialog domain used on this paper has 371070 user goals).",

        "4.1 Task Description We used the DSTC2 dialog domain in which the user queries the database of local restaurants.",
        "The dataset for the restaurant information domain were originally collected using Amazon Mechanical Turk.",
        "A usual dialog proceeds as follows: the user specifies the constraints (e.g. type of food, location, etc) or the name of restaurant he wants, and the system offers the name of a restaurant that qualifies the constraints.",
        "User then accepts the of-fer, and requests for additional information about accepted restaurant.",
        "The dialog ends when all the information requested by the user is provided.",
        "The dialog state tracker should thereby clarify three types of information inside the state: goal, method, and requested.",
        "The goal state is composed of name, pricerange, area, and food slots, which is the information of the constraints that the user has.",
        "The method state represents what method user is using to accomplish his goal, whose value is one of the none, by constraints, by alternatives, by name, or finished.",
        "Lastly, the requested state represents the information currently requested by the user, such as the address, phone number, postal code, etc.",
        "In this paper, we restrict ourselves to tracking the goal states only, but our tracker can be easily extended to track others as well.",
        "The dialog state tracker updates the belief turn by turn, receiving SLU N-best hypotheses each with an SLU confidence score in every turn.",
        "Despite the large number of states a dialog can have, in the most cases, the coverage of N-best hypotheses is enough to limit the consideration of possible goal state to values that has been observed in SLU hypotheses.",
        "Consequently, the task of the dialog state tracker is to generate a set of observed values and their confidence scores for each slot, with the confidence score corresponding to the posterior probability of the goal state being the true goal state.",
        "The dialog state tracker also maintains a special goal state, called None, which represents that the true goal state has not been observed.",
        "Its posterior probability is also computed together with the observed goal states as a part of the belief update.",

        "?",
        "dstc2 dev: Composed of 506 dialogs of 3836 turns, produced from the dialog managers used in dstc2 train set.",
        "Most of dialog state trackers show lower performance on this dataset than others.",
        "?",
        "dstc2 test: Composed of 1117 dialogs of 9689 turns, produced from the dialog policy trained by reinforcement learning, which is not used for the train and dev datasets.",
        "We used both train and dev sets as the training data, as if they were one big dataset.",
        "Although the true labels for the test dataset were made public after the challenge, we did not use these labels in any way for optimizing our tracker.",
        "5.2 Pre-training One of the drawbacks in using gradient descent is convergence to a local optimum.",
        "We also observed this phenomena during the training of our dialog state tracker via cascading gradient descent.",
        "Randomized initialization of parameters is a common practice for gradient descent, but given the high-dimensionality of the parameter space, the randomized initialization had a limited effect in converging to a sufficiently good local optimum.",
        "We adopted a pre-training phase where the parameters of each component model are optimized individually.",
        "Once the pre-training is done for each component model, we gathered the parameter values and took them as the initial parameter value for the cascading gradient descent.",
        "This pre-training phase helped tremendously converging to a good local optimum, and reduced the number of iterations as well.",
        "We pre-trained the parameters of each component model as follows: ?",
        "Observation Model: True user action labels in the training set are used as targets for the observation model.",
        "For every user action hypothesis in theN -best list, set the target value to 1 if the user action hypothesis is the true user action, and 0 otherwise.",
        "A simple gradient descent was used for pre-training.",
        "?",
        "User Action Model: Although the user action and the system action labels are avail-able, the partition of the user goals is not readily available.",
        "However, the latter can be easily obtained by running an unoptimized tracker.",

        "Belief Refinement Model: Since there is only a single parameter for this model, we did not perform pre-training.",
        "5.3 Results and Discussion Table 3 shows the test set score of tracker implemented based on proposed algorithm, with the score of other trackers submitted to DSTC2.",
        "We tried 200 random initialised weights to train model with proposed algorithm, and learned model with the lowest training L2 error is picked to show the result on the test set.",
        "Because we only used live SLU and past data to track dialog state, other tracker results with the same condition are selected to compare with our tracker.",
        "The implementation of our algorithm was not ready until the DSTC2 deadline.",
        "We participated as Team 8 using the old optimization method in (Kim et al., 2013).",
        "As shown in the table 3, the new algorithm shows a substantial improve-ment, achieving almost 15% decrease in the L2 error.",
        "Since both trackers are fine-tuned, this improvement seems to be originated from the new optimization algorithm.",
        "For all three featured metrics used to evalu-ate, tracker constructed with our proposed method shows competitive performance.",
        "The key to excel baseline tracker was to discover the relation between user action and system action.",
        "For exam-ple, user actions that tell about the same slot system was talking about but giving different value are usually correcting wrong recognitions so far, which should significantly reduce the belief over state the system was tracking.",
        "Due to the objective function that is designed to optimize L2 error, our tracker shows better performance at L2 error than the other metrics.",
        "For both all goal metric and joint goal metric, our tracker shows low L2 error when compared to other trackers while the rank of accuracy metric is not so high.",
        "When the fact that our method as a generative state tracker benefits from the ability to be easily incorporated into POMDP framework is con-sidered, only similar performance to other trackers is satisfactory.",
