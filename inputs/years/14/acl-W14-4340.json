        "While communicating with a user, statistical spoken dialog systems must maintain a distribution over possible dialog states in a process called dialog state tracking.",
        "This distribution, also called the belief state, directly determines the system's decisions.",
        "In MDP-based systems, only the most likely dialog state is considered and in this case the primary metric is dialog state accuracy (Bo- hus and Rudnicky, 2006).",
        "In POMDP-based sys-tems, the full distribution is considered and then the shape of the distribution as measured by an L2 norm is equally important (Young et al., 2009).",
        "In both cases, good quality state tracking is essential to maintaining good overall system performance.",
        "Typically, state tracking has assumed the output of a Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) component in the form of a semantic decoder, which maps the hypotheses from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to a list of semantic hypotheses.",
        "This paper considers mapping directly from ASR hypotheses to an updated belief state at each turn in the dialog, omitting the intermediate SLU processing step.",
        "This word-based state tracking avoids the need for an explicit semantic representation and also avoids the possibility of information loss at the SLU stage.",
        "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) provide a natural model for state tracking in dialog, as they are able to model and classify dynamic sequences with complex behaviours from step to step.",
        "Whereas, most previous approaches to discriminative state tracking have adapted stationary classifiers to the temporal process of dialog (Bohus and Rudnicky, 2006; Lee and Eskenazi, 2013; Lee, 2013; Williams, 2013; Henderson et al., 2013b).",
        "One notable exception is Ren et al. (2013), which used conditional random fields to model the sequence temporally.",
        "Currently proposed methods of discriminative state tracking require engineering of feature functions to represent the turn in the dialog (Ren et al., 2013; Lee and Eskenazi, 2013; Lee, 2013; Williams, 2013; Henderson et al., 2013b).",
        "It is unclear whether differences in performance are due to feature engineering or the underlying models.",
        "This paper proposes a method of using simple n-gram type features which avoid the need for feature engineering.",
        "Instead of using inputs with a select few very informative features, the approach is to use high-dimensional inputs with all the information to potentially reconstruct any such hand-crafted feature.",
        "The impact of significantly increasing the dimensionality of the inputs is managed by careful initialisation of model parameters.",
        "Accuracy on unseen or infrequent slot values is an important concern, particularly for discriminative classifiers which are prone to overfitting training data.",
        "This is addressed by structuring the recurrent neural network to include a component which is independent of the actual slot value in question.",
        "It thus learns general behaviours for specifying slots enabling it to successfully decode 292 ASR output which includes previously unseen slot values.",
        "In summary, this paper presents a word-based approach to dialog state tracking using recurrent neural networks.",
        "The model is capable of generalising to unseen dialog state hypotheses, and requires very little feature engineering.",
        "The approach is evaluated in the second Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC2) (Henderson et al., 2014) where it is shown to be extremely competi-tive, particularly in terms of the quality of its confidence scores.",
        "Following a brief outline of DSTC2 in section 2, the definition of the model is given in section 3.",
        "Section 4 then gives details on the initialisation methods used for training.",
        "Finally results on the DSTC2 evaluation are given in 5.",
        "2 The Second Dialog State Tracking Challenge This section describes the domain and methodology of the second Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC2).",
        "The challenge is based on a large corpus collected using a variety of telephone-based dialog systems in the domain of finding a restaurant in Cambridge.",
        "In all cases, the subjects were recruited using Amazon Mechanical Turk.",
        "The data is split into a train, dev and test set.",
        "The train and dev sets were supplied with labels, and the test set was released unlabelled for a one week period.",
        "At the end of the week, all participants were required to submit their trackers?",
        "output on the test set, and the labels were revealed.",
        "A mis-match was ensured between training and testing conditions by choosing dialogs for the evaluation collected using a separate dialog manager.",
        "This emulates the mis-match a new tracker would encounter if it were actually deployed in an end-to-end system.",
        "In summary, the datasets used are: ?",
        "dstc2 train Labelled training consisting of 1612 dialogs with two dialog managers and two acoustic conditions.",
        "?",
        "dstc2 dev Labelled dataset consisting of 506 calls in the same conditions as dstc2 train, but with no caller in common.",
        "?",
        "dstc2 test Evaluation dataset consisting of 1117 dialogs collected using a dialog manager not seen in the labelled data.",
        "In contrast with DSTC1, DSTC2 introduces dynamic user goals, tracking of requested slots and tracking the restaurant search method.",
        "A DSTC2 tracker must therefore report: ?",
        "Goals: A distribution over the user's goal for each slot.",
        "This is a distribution over the possible values for that slot, plus the special value None, which means no valid value has been mentioned yet.",
        "?",
        "Requested slots: A reported probability for each requestable slot that has been requested by the user, and should be informed by the system.",
        "?",
        "Method: A distribution over methods, which encodes how the user is trying to use the dialog system.",
        "E.g. ?by constraints?, when the user is trying to constrain the search, and ?fin- ished?, when the user wants to end the dialog.",
        "A tracker may report the goals as a joint over all slots, but in this paper the joint is reported as a product of the marginal distributions per slot.",
        "Full details of the challenge are given in Henderson et al. (2013a), Henderson et al. (2014).",
        "The trackers presented in this paper are identified under ?team4?",
        "in the reported results.",
        "3 Recurrent Neural Network Model This section defines the RNN structure used for dialog state tracking.",
        "One such RNN is used per slot, taking the most recent dialog turn (user input plus last machine dialog act) as input, updating its internal memory and calculating an updated belief over the values for the slot.",
        "In what follows, the notation a?b is used to denote the concatenation of two vectors, a and b. The i th component of the vector a is written a| i .",
        "3.1 Feature Representation Extracting n-grams from utterances and dialog acts provides the feature representations needed for input into the RNN.",
        "This process is very similar to the feature extraction described in Henderson et al. (2012), and is outlined in figure 1.",
        "For n-gram features extracted from the ASR N -best list, unigram, bigram and trigram features are calculated for each hypothesis.",
        "These are then weighted by the N -best list probabilities and summed to give a single vector.",
        "Dialog acts in this domain consist of a list of component acts of the form acttype(slot=value) where the slot=value pair is optional.",
        "The n-gram type features 293 extracted from each such component act are ?acttype?, ?slot?, ?value?, ?acttype slot?, ?slot value?",
        "and ?acttype slot value?, or just ?acttype?",
        "for the act acttype().",
        "Each feature is given weight 1, and the features from individual component acts are summed.",
        "To provide a contrast, trackers have also been implemented using the user dialog acts output by an SLU rather than directly from the ASR output.",
        "In this case, the SLU N -best dialog act list is encoded in the same way except that the n-grams from each hypothesis are weighted by the corresponding probabilities, and summed to give a single feature vector.",
        "Consider a word-based tracker which takes an ASR N -best list and the last machine act as input for each turn, as shown in figure 1.",
        "A combined feature representation of both the ASR N -best list and the last machine act is obtained by concatenating the vectors.",
        "This means that in figure 1 the food feature from the ASR and the food feature from the machine act contribute to separate components of the final vector f .",

        "In general, the RNN appears to be a promising model, which deals naturally with sequential input and outputs.",
        "High dimensional inputs are handled well, with little feature engineering, particularly when carefully initialised (e.g. as here using denoising autoencoders and shared initialisation).",
        "Future work should include making joint predictions on components of the dialog state.",
        "In this paper each component was tracked using its own RNN.",
        "Though not presented in this paper, no improvement could be found by joining the RNNs.",
        "However, this may not be the case for other domains in which slot values are more highly correlated.",
        "The concept of tagging the feature functions allows for generalisation to unseen values and slots.",
        "This generalisation will be explored in future work, particularly for dialogs in more open-domains.",
