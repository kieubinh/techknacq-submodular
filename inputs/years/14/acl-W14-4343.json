        "Dialog state tracking is important because spoken dialog systems rely on it to choose proper actions as spoken dialog systems interact with users.",
        "However, due to automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spoken language understanding (SLU) errors, it is not easy for the dialog manager to maintain the true state of the dialog.",
        "In recent years, much research has been devoted to dialog state tracking.",
        "Many approaches have been applied to dialog state tracking, from rule-based to statistical models, from generative models to discriminative models (Wang and Lemon, 2013; Zilka et al., 2013; Henderson et al., 2013; Lee and Eskenazi, 2013).",
        "Recently, shared research tasks like the first Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC 1) (Williams et al., 2013) have provided a common testbed and evaluation suite for dialog state tracking (Henderson et al., 2013).",
        "Compared with DSTC 1 which is in the bus timetables domain, DSTC 2 introduces more complicated and dynamic dialog states, which may change through the dialog, in a new domain, i.e. restaurants domain (Henderson et al., 2014).",
        "For each turn, a tracker is supposed to output a set of distributions for each of the three components of the dialog state: goals, method, and requested slots.",
        "At a given turn, the goals consists of the user's true required value having been revealed for each slot in the dialog up until that turn; the method is the way the user is trying to interact with the system which may be by name, by constraints, by alternatives or finished; and the requested slots consist of the slots which have been requested by the user and not replied by the system.",
        "For evaluation in DSTC 2, 1-best quality measured by accu-racy, probability calibration measured by L2, and discrimination measured by ROC are selected as featured metrics.",
        "Further details can be found in the DSTC 2 handbook (Henderson et al., 2013).",
        "Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of rule-based (Zilka et al., 2013), maximum entropy (MaxEnt) (Lee and Eskenazi, 2013) and deep neural network (DNN) (Henderson et al., 2013) models separately.",
        "Motivated by this, the SJTU system employs a combination of a rule-based model, a MaxEnt and a DNN model.",
        "The three models were first trained (if necessary) on the training set and tested for each of the three components of the dialog state, i.e goals, method, and requested slots on the development set.",
        "Then, models with the best performance for each of the three components were selected to form a combined model.",
        "Finally, the combined model was retrained using both training set and development set.",
        "Additionally, as the live SLU was found not good enough with some information lost compared with the live ASR, a new semantic parser was implemented which took the live ASR as input and the SJTU system used the result from the new semantic parser instead of the live SLU.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the design of the new 318 semantic parser.",
        "Section 3 presents the rule-based model.",
        "Section 4 describes the statistical models including the maximum entropy model and the deep neural network model.",
        "Section 5 shows and discusses the performance of the SJTU system.",
        "Fi-nally, section 6 concludes the paper.",
        "2 Semantic Parser It was found that the live SLU provided by the organisers has poor quality.",
        "Hence, a new statistical semantic parser is trained to parse the live ASR hypotheses.",
        "2.1 Semantic Tuple Classifier The semantics of an utterance is represented in functor form called dialogue act consisting of a dialogue act type and a list of slot-value pairs, for example: request(name,food=chinese) where ?request?",
        "is the dialogue act type,?name?",
        "is a slot requested and ?food=chinese?",
        "is a slot-value pair which provides some information to the system.",
        "In DSTC 2, there are many different dialogue act types (e.g.",
        "?request?, ?inform?, ?deny?, etc) and different slot-value pairs (e.g.",
        "?food=chinese?, ?pricerange=cheap?, ?area=center?, etc), which are all called semantic items.",
        "A semantic tuple (e.g. act type, type-slot pair, slot-value pair) classifier (STC) approach developed by Mairesse et al. ( 2009) is used in the SJTU system.",
        "It requires a set of SVMs to be trained on n-gram features from a given utterance: a multi-class SVM is used to predict the dialogue act type, and a binary SVM is used to predict the existence of each slot-value pair.",
        "Henderson et al. ( 2012) improved this method with converting the SVM outputs to probabilities, and approximating the probability of a dialogue-act d of type d-type j with a set of slot-value pairs S by: P (d|u) = P (d-type j |u) ?",
        "sv?S P (sv|u) ?",
        "sv/?S (1?",
        "P (sv|u)) (1) where u denotes an utterance and sv runs over all possible slot-value pairs.",
        "2.2 Dialogue Context Features In addition to the n-gram feature used in the original STC parser, the dialogue context can be exploited to constrain the semantic parser.",
        "In DSTC 2, the dialogue context available contains the history information of user's ASR hypotheses, the system act and the other output of system (e.g. whether there is a barge-in from the user or not, the turn-index) and so on.",
        "In the SJTU system, the context features from the last system act (in- dicators for all act types and slot-value pairs on whether they appear), an indicator for ?barge-in?",
        "and the reciprocal of turn-index are combined with the original n-gram feature to be the final feature vector.",
        "2.3 Generating Confidence Scores For testing and predicting the dialogue act, the semantic parser is applied to each of the top N ASR hypotheses h i , and the set of results D i with m i distinct dialogue act hypotheses would be merged in following way: P (d|o) = N ?",
        "i=1 { p(h i |o)p(d|h i ) if d ?",
        "D i 0 otherwise where o is the acoustic observation, d runs over each different dialogue act in D i , i = 1, ..., N , p(h i |o) denotes the ASR posterior probability of the i-th hypothesis, p(d|h i ) denotes the semantic posterior probability given the i-th ASR hypothesis as in equation (1).",
        "Finally, a normalization should be done to guarantee the sum of P (d|o) to be one.",
        "2.4 Implementation The STCs-based semantic parser is implemented with linear kernel SVMs trained using the Lib-SVM package (Chang and Lin, 2011).",
        "The SVM misclassification cost parameters are optimised individually for each SVM classifier by performing cross-validations on the training data.",
        "3 Rule-based Model In this section, the rule-based model which is slightly different from the focus tracker (Hender- son et al., 2013) and HWU tracker (Wang, 2013) is described.",
        "The idea of the rule-based model is to maintain beliefs based on basic probability operations and a few heuristic rules that can be observed on the training set.",
        "In the following the rule-based model for joint goals, method and requested slots are described in detail.",
        "319 3.1 Joint Goals For slot s, the i-th turn and value v, p + s,i,v (p ?",

        "In particular, when i = 0, b s,0,v = 1 if v = ?None?, otherwise 0.",
        "The motivation here comes from HWU tracker (Wang, 2013) that only p + s,?,v positively contributes to the belief of slot s being v, and both p + s,?,v ?",
        "(v ?",
        "6= v) and p ?",
        "s,?,v contribute to the belief negatively.",
        "3.2 Method For the i-th turn, p i,m is used to denote the sum of all the confidence scores assigned by the SLU to method m. Then the belief of ?the method being m in the i-th turn?",

        "In particular, b 0,m = 0 when i = 0 and m 6= ?none?.",
        "An explanation of the above formula is given by Zilka et al. (2013).",
        "The idea is also adopted by the focus tracker (Henderson et al., 2013).",
        "3.3 Requested Slots For the i-th turn and slot r, p i,r is used to denote the sum of all the confidence scores assigned by the SLU to r is one of the requested slots.",
        "Then the belief of ?r being one of the requested slots in the i-th turn?",
        "denoted by b i,r is defined as follows.",
        "?",
        "If i = 1, or system has at least one of the following actions: ?canthelp?, ?offer?, ?reqmore?, ?confirm-domain?, ?expl-conf?, ?bye?, ?request?, b i,r = p i,r ?",
        "Otherwise, b i,r = b i?1,r (1?",
        "p i,r ) + p i,r This rule is a combination of the idea of HWU tracker (Wang, 2013) and an observation from the labelled data that once system has some certain ac-tions, the statistics of requested slots from the past turn should be reset.",
