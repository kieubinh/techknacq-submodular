        "In this section, we evaluate the extraction performance of this and other methods.",
        "The evaluation results are shown in Table 2.",
        "The data set for evaluation consists of 10,000 new sentences from Web documents.",
        "We use each method to extract positive sentences from the set for evaluation.",
        "We then randomly extract 100 data items (200 for the baseline method only) from the sentences extracted by each method and manually evaluate them.",
        "From the evaluation results we approximately calculate the precision rates, the recall rates, and the F-measures.",
        "We estimate the denominator of the recall rate from the number of positive examples detected by the baseline method.",
        "The baseline method judges that all the inputs are positive.",
        "In the ?ML method (xth)?",
        "we use supervised data for machine learning after adding the xth positive and negative examples to the supervised data (by the method in Section 2.2).",
        "In ?Pattern method 1?",
        "we extract sentences that contain words whose positive appearance ratio is at least 0.8 and that appear at least four times as positive examples.",
        "In ?Pattern method 2?",
        "we extract sentences that contain the word ?kando?",
        "(impression) as positive examples.",
        "With machine learning we obtain a precision rate of 0.40 after we add the 10th positive and negative examples to the supervised data.",
        "This precision rate is much higher than the 0.07 rate we obtain with the 34 baseline method.",
        "Some may think that the 0.40 precision rate obtained with machine learning is low.",
        "However, since the task of extracting impressive sentences is a very difficult one, and since the rate is much higher than the baseline method rate, we can say that the machine learning results are at least adequate.",
        "5 Related studies Many methods have been reported that estimated the orientation (positive or negative contents) or the emotion of a sentence (Turney and Littman, 2003; Pang and Lee, 2008; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Alm et al., 2005; Aman and Szpakowicz, 2007; Strapparava andMihalcea, 2008; Inkpen et al., 2009; Neviarouskaya et al., 2009).",
        "However, the studies did not address the task of collecting and analyzing impressive sentences to support the generation of such sentences.",
        "There have been studies that addressed the task of automatically evaluating sentences to support sentence generation (Bangalore and Whittaker, 2000; Mutton and Dale, 2007).",
        "However, the studies did not address the task of generating impressive sentences.",
        "In our study, we used machine learning to extract impressive sentences.",
        "There have been other studies as well in which machine learning was used to extract information (Murata et al., 2011; Stijn De Saeger and Hashimoto, 2009).",
        "Murata et al. extracted articles describing problems, their solutions, and their causes (Murata et al., 2011).",
        "Saeger et al. extracted several types of words from a large scale of Web documents by using machine learning (Stijn De Saeger and Hashimoto, 2009).",
        "In their method, they manually make supervised data sets for extracted words and extract more words from Web documents using supervised methods.",
        "Their study is similar to ours in that both use the same framework of manually making a small scale supervised data set and then extracting more data items from Web documents.",
        "6 Conclusion We collected sentences in Japanese that impressed readers (?impressive sentences?)",
        "and examined them through the use of characteristic words in order to support the generation of impressive sentences.",
        "In our examination, we obtained jinsei (human life), hitobito (people), koufuku (happiness), yujou (friend- liness), seishun (youth), ren?ai (love), etc.",
        "as words that often appear in impressive sentences.",
        "Sentences in which one or more of these words are used would be likely to impress the listener or reader.",
        "The results we obtained should provide useful information for generating impressive sentences.",
        "In this study, we used machine learning to extract impressive sentences and found that with this method we could extract them from a large amount of Web documents with a precision rate of 0.40.",
        "In future work, we intend to use this method to collect more impressive sentences.",
        "We also plan to analyze the sentences by using not only words but also parameters such as syntax patterns and rhetorical expressions.",
