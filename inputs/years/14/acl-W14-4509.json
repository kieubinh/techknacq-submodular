        "In this paper, we present a study about connections between a product (the target of a problem phrase) and words (problem indicators), describing unexpected situations specific to products.",
        "We define problem indicators as words describing phrases that contain obvious links to a problem (e.g., problem, issue).",
        "We also define problem indicators as words that mention implicit problems (e.g., after, sometimes).",
        "The problem indicator may be presented as an action verb with a negation expressing product failure.",
        "The task is to identify which noun phrases (NPs) referred to the problem target in the sentence.",

        "The first subtask, problem phrase identification, determines whether a given sentence contains problem phrases.",
        "The second subtask, target phrase extraction, identifies the targets of a given problem phrase.",

        "However, the presence of indicators in the sentence may have insufficient context to determine the prob-lem's existence.",
