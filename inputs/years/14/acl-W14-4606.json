        "Dhonnchadha, 2009; Lynn et al., 2012a; Lynn et al., 2012b; Lynn et al., 2013).",
        "One such resource is the Irish Dependency Treebank (Lynn et al., 2012a) which contains just over 1000 gold standard dependency parse trees.",
        "These trees are labelled with deep syntactic information, marking grammatical roles such as subject, object, modifier, and coordinator.",
        "While a valuable resource, the treebank does not compare in size to similar resources of other languages.",
        "1 The small size of the treebank affects the accuracy of any statistical parsing models learned from this treebank.",
        "Therefore, we would like to investigate whether training data from other languages can be successfully utilised to improve Irish parsing.",
        "Cross-lingual transfer parsing involves training a parser on one language, and parsing data of another language.",
        "McDonald et al. (2011) describe two types of cross-lingual parsing, direct transfer parsing in which a delexicalised version of the source language treebank is used to train a parsing model which is then used to parse the target language, and a more complicated projected transfer approach in which the direct transfer approach is used to seed a parsing model which is then trained to obey source-target constraints learned from a parallel corpus.",
        "These experiments revealed that languages that were typologically similar were not necessarily the best source-target pairs, sometimes due to variations between their language-specific annotation schemes.",
        "In more recent work, however, McDonald et al. (2013) reported improved results on cross-lingual direct transfer parsing using a universal annotation scheme, to which six chosen treebanks are mapped for uniformity purposes.",
        "Underlying the experiments with this new annotation scheme is the universal part-of-speech (POS) tagset designed by Petrov et al. (2012).",
        "While their results confirm that parsers trained on data from languages in the same language group (e.g.",
        "Romance and Germanic) show the most accurate results, they also show that training data taken across language-groups also produces promising results.",
        "We attempt to apply the direct transfer approach with Irish as the target language.",
        "The Irish language belongs to the Celtic branch of the Indo-European language family.",
        "The natural first step in cross-lingual parsing for Irish would be to look to those languages of the Celtic language ",
        "1 For example, the Danish dependency treebank has 5,540 trees (Kromann, 2003); the Finnish dependency treebank has 15,126 trees (Haverinen et al., 2013) 41 group, i.e. Welsh, Scots Gaelic, Manx, Breton and Cornish, as a source of training data.",
        "However, these languages are just as, if not further, under-resourced.",
        "Thus, we attempt to use the languages of the universal dependency treebanks (McDonald et al., 2013).",
        "The paper is organised as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we give an overview of the status of the Irish language and the Irish Dependency Treebank.",
        "Section 3 describes the mapping of the Irish Dependency Treebank's POS tagset (U??",
        "Dhonnchadha and van Genabith, 2006) to that of Petrov et al. (2012), and the Irish Dependency Treebank annotation scheme (Lynn et al. (2012b)) to the Universal Dependency Scheme.",
        "Following that, in Section 4 we carry out cross-lingual direct transfer parsing experiments with ten harmonised treebanks to assess whether any of these languages are suitable for such parsing transfer for Irish.",
        "Section 5 summarises our work.",
        "2 Irish Language and Treebank Irish, a minority EU language, is the national and official language of Ireland.",
        "Despite this status, Irish is only spoken on a daily basis by a minority.",
        "As a Celtic language, Irish shares specific linguistic features with other Celtic languages, such as a VSO (verb-subject-object) word order and interesting morphological features such as inflected prepositions and initial mutations, for example.",
        "Compared to other EU-official languages, Irish language technology is under-resourced, as highlighted by a recent study (Judge et al., 2012).",
        "In the area of morpho-syntactic processing, recent years have seen the development of a part-of-speech tagger (U??",
        "Dhonnchadha and van Genabith, 2006), a morphological analyser (U??",
        "Dhonnchadha et al., 2003), a shallow chunker (U??",
        "Dhonnchadha, 2009), a dependency treebank (Lynn et al., 2012a; Lynn et al., 2012b) and statistical dependency parsing models for MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2006) and Mate parser (Bohnet, 2010) trained on this treebank (Lynn et al., 2013).",
        "The annotation scheme for the Irish Dependency Treebank (Lynn et al., 2012b) was inspired by Lexical Functional Grammar (Bresnan, 2001) and has its roots in the dependency annotation scheme described by C?etino?glu et al. (2010).",
        "It was extended and adapted to suit the linguistic characterisics of the Irish language.",
        "The final label set consists of 47 dependency labels, defining grammatical and functional relations between the words in a sentence.",
        "The label set is hierarchical in nature with labels such as vparticle (verb particle) and vocparticle (vocative particle), for example, representing more fine-grained versions of the particle label.",
        "3 A universal dependency scheme for the Irish Dependency Treebank In this section, we describe how a ?universal?",
        "version of the Irish Dependency Treebank was created by mapping the original POS tags to universal POS tags and mapping the original dependency scheme to the universal dependency scheme.",
        "The result of this effort is an alternative version of the Irish Dependency Treebank which will be made available to the research community along with the original.",
        "3.1 Mapping the Irish POS tagset to the Universal POS tagset The Universal POS tagset (Petrov et al., 2012) has been designed to facilitate unsupervised and cross-lingual part-of-speech tagging and parsing research, by simplifying POS tagsets and unifying them across languages.",
        "The Irish Dependency Treebank was built upon a POS-tagged corpus developed by U??",
        "Dhonnchadha and van Genabith (2006).",
        "The treebank's tagset contains both coarse- and fine-grained POS tags which we map to the Universal POS tags (e.g.",
        "Prop Noun?",
        "NOUN).",
        "Table 1 shows the mappings.",

        "In Irish syntax literature, there is some discussion over its syntactic role, whether it is a verb or a linking particle.",
        "The role normally played is that of a linking element between a subject and a predicate.",
        "However, Lynn et al. (2012a)'s syntactic analysis of the copula is in line with that of Stenson (1981), regarding it as a verb.",
        "In addition, because the copula is often labelled in the Irish annotation scheme as the syntactic head of the matrix clause, we have chosen VERB as the most suitable mapping for this part of speech.",

        "The mappings are given in Table 2.",
        "As with the POS mapping discussed in Section 3.1, mapping the Irish dependency scheme to the universal scheme was relatively straightforward, due in part, perhaps, to a similar level of granularity suggested by the similar label set sizes (Irish 47; standard universal 41).",

        "A parser is trained on a concatenation of all the delexicalised source data described in Section 4.1 and tested on the full delexicalised Universal Irish Dependency Treebank.",
        "Combining all source data produces parsing results of 57.69% (UAS) and 41.38% (LAS), which is outperformed by the best individual source language model.",
        "Parsing with the large English training set (LargestT) yielded results of 51.59 (UAS) and 33.97 (LAS) compared to a UAS/LAS of 51.72/35.05 for the smaller English training set.",
        "We investigated more closely why the larger training set did not improve performance by incrementally adding training sentences to the smaller set ?",
        "none of these increments reveal any higher scores, suggesting that English is not a suitable source training language for Irish.",
        "It is well known that sentence length has a negative effect on parsing accuracy.",
        "As noted in earlier experiments (Lynn et al., 2012b), the Irish Dependency Treebank contains some very long difficult-to-parse sentences (some legal text exceeds 300 tokens in length).",
        "The average sentence length is 27 tokens.",
        "By placing a 30-token limit on the Universal Irish Dependency Treebank we are left with 778 sentences, with an average sentence length of 14.",
        "We use this new 30-token-limit version of the Irish Dependency Treebank data to test our parsing models.",
        "The results are shown in the lower half of Table 3.",
        "Not surprisingly, the results rise substantially for all models.",
        "4.3 Discussion McDonald et al. (2013)'s single-source transfer parsing results show that languages within the same language groups make good source-target pairs.",
        "They also show reasonable accuracy of source-target pairing across language groups.",
        "For instance, the baseline when parsing French is 81.44 (UAS) and 73.37 (LAS), while the transfer results obtained using an English treebank are 70.14 (UAS) and 58.20(LAS).",
        "Our baseline parser for Irish yields results of 78.54 (UAS) and 71.59 (LAS), while Indonesian-Irish transfer results are 61.69 (UAS) and 43.88 (LAS).",
        "The lowest scoring source language is Japanese.",
        "This parsing model's output shows less than 3% accuracy when identifying the ROOT label.",
        "This suggests the effect that the divergent word orders have 6 All scores are micro-averaged.",
        "47 on this type of cross-lingual parsing ?",
        "VSO (Irish) vs SOV (Japanese).",
        "Another factor that is likely to be playing a role is the size of the Japanese sentences.",
        "The average sentence length in the Japanese training data is only 9 words, which means that this dataset is comparatively smaller than the others.",
        "It is also worth noting that the universal Japanese treebank uses only 15 of the 41 universal labels (the universal Irish treebank uses 30 of these labels).",
        "As our best performing model (Indonesian) is an Austronesian language, we investigate why this language does better when compared to Indo-European languages.",
        "We compare the results obtained by the Indonesian parser with those of the English parser (SingleT).",
        "Firstly, we note that the Indonesian parser captures nominal modification much better than English, resulting in an increased precision-recall score of 60/67 on compmod.",
        "This highlights that the similarities in noun-noun modification between Irish and Indonesian helps cross-lingual parsing.",
        "In both languages the modifying noun directly follows the head noun, e.g. ?the statue of the hero?",
        "translates in Irish as dealbh an laoich (lit.",
        "statue the hero); in Indonesian as patung palawan (lit.",
        "statue hero).",
        "Secondly, our analysis shows that the English parser does not capture long-distance dependencies as well as the Indonesian parser.",
        "For example, we have observed an increased difference in precision-recall of 44%-44% on mark, 12%-17.88% on cc and 4%-23.17% on rcmod when training on Indonesian.",
        "Similar differences have also been observed when we compare with the French and English (LargestT) parsers.",
        "The Irish language allows for the use of multiple conjoined structures within a sentence and it appears that long-distance dependencies can affect cross-lingual parsing.",
        "Indeed, excluding very long sentences from the test set reveals substantial increases in precision-recall scores for labels such as advcl, cc, conj and ccomp ?",
        "all of which are labels associated with long-distance dependencies.",
        "With this study, we had hoped that we would be able to identify a way to bootstrap the development of the Irish Dependency Treebank and parser through the use of delexicalised treebanks annotated with the Universal Annotation Scheme.",
        "While the current treebank data might capture certain linguistic phenomena well, we expected that some cross-linguistic regularities could be taken advantage of.",
        "Although the best cross-lingual model failed to outperform the monolingual model, perhaps it might be possible to combine the strengths of the Indonesian and Irish treebanks?",
        "We performed 5-fold cross-validation on the combined Indonesian and Irish data sets.",
        "The results did not improve over the Irish model.",
        "We then analysed the extent of their complementarity by counting the number of sentences where the Indonesian model outperformed the Irish model.",
        "This happened in only 20 cases, suggesting that there is no benefit in using the Indonesian data over the Irish data nor in combining them at the sentence-level.",
        "5 Conclusion and Future Work In this paper, we have reported an implementation of cross-lingual direct transfer parsing of the Irish language.",
        "We have also presented and explained our mapping of the Irish Dependency Treebank to the Universal POS tagset and Universal Annotation Scheme.",
        "Our parsing results show that an Austronesian language surpasses Indo-European languages as source data for cross-lingual Irish parsing.",
        "In extending this research, there are many interesting avenues which could be explored including the use of Irish as a source language for another Celtic language and experimenting with the projected transfer approach of McDonald et al. (2011).",
