        "This paper presents an overview of the GALLU (Gwaith Adnabod Lleferydd Uwch-IPA: [?a??",
        "], trans-lation: further speech recognition work) project to develop speech recognition technology for the Welsh language.",
        "Wales has a population of around 3 million people, of whom around 20% speak Welsh (Office for National Statistics, 2012).",
        "Lesser-resourced languages typically lag in digital inno-vation, including in language technologies.",
        "However since 2012, the Welsh Government has updated and revised a strategy for supporting Welsh-language technology.",
        "Emphasis is placed on ?more tools and resources ?",
        "to facilitate the use of Welsh, including in the digital environment?",
        "(Welsh Govern-ment, 2012: 45) and ?the development of new Welsh-language software applications and digital ser-vices?",
        "(Welsh Government, 2013; 12).",
        "With funding from the Welsh Government and S4C (the Welsh language television channel), the GALLU project aims to develop speech recognition technology for the Welsh language.",
        "The resources will be available under a permissive open-source licence, and will therefore be available for use in a broad spectrum of platforms and devices, including voice control for smart televisions.",
        "2 Previous speech technology for Welsh Prior to the GALLU project, the most substantial work on Welsh speech technology was developed under the WISPR (Welsh and Irish Speech Processing Resources) project (Prys et al., 2004).",
        "Previous work on a diphone-based synthesiser (Williams, 1994; 1995) and also a small speech database for Welsh (Williams, 1999) was built upon by the WISPR project.",
        "An improved synthetic Welsh voice was developed as part of the WISPR project as well as an MSAPI interface to Festival for use in Microsoft Windows environments (Bangor University Text to Speech, [no date]).",
        "Following the release of the WISPR resources under an open-source (BSD) licence, further work was facilitated to develop commercial Welsh voices by the Language Technologies Unit at Bangor University, by the Finnish company Bitlips (Bitlips Text to Speech, [no date]) and the Polish company Ivona (Ivona Text to Speech, [no date]).",
        "A ?Basic Welsh speech recognition\" (Bangor University, [no date]) project at the Language Technologies Unit at Bangor University in 2008-9 resulted in laboratory prototypes for a) a ?command and control?",
        "application for a PC where applications could be launched by voice control and b) a simple voice-driven calculator.",
        "The GALLU project will build on this to develop further Welsh speech recognition resources.",
        "This work is licenced under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License.",
        "55 3 Data design The Welsh language has up to 29 consonants and a large number of vowels: up to 13 monophthongs and 13 diphthongs dependent on the variety (Awbery, 1984; Ball, 1984; Jones, 1984; Ball and Wil-liams, 2001; Mayr and Davies, 2011; amongst others).",
        "In order to collect the appropriate data to train an acoustic model within HTK ([no date]), a set of phonetically rich words has been designed for contributors to read aloud.",
        "In designing the prompt set it was important to ensure that a small number of prompts contain representations of all of the phonemes in the language.",
        "The WISPR project's letter-to-sound rules were rewritten based on data mining from a lexicon, and a list of the most common sounds and words was extracted from a text corpus.",
        "The final prompt set will contain approximately 200 prompts (8 words per prompt) covering all of the phonemes in the language which may be recorded by contributors across different sessions.",

        "The next steps for the project involve further data collection and linguistic model development.",
        "4 Data collection: crowdsourcing and the Paldaruo Application A large number of speakers are required in order to train the acoustic model which forms the basis of the speech recognition system.",
        "Recruiting speakers to attend a recording session at a sound booth with recording software can prove expensive and time consuming.",
        "In attempting to tackle this issue, a crowdsourcing approach is being used as a method for collecting data.",
        "Crowdsourcing is a low-cost and efficient way of collecting speech data.",
        "A mobile application ?Paldaruo?",
        "(Welsh for ?chattering?)",
        "has been developed for iOS and Android devices.",
        "Such devices, with inbuilt microphones and internet connectivity, provide a convenient mechanism for many volunteers to contribute speech corpus data.",
        "The app is optimised for ease of use in order to maximise potential contributions.",
        "Each volunteer creates their own profile within the app providing metadata related to sex, age, linguistic characteristics and geographical background.",
        "Following this, the volunteers explicitly agree to their contributions being collected and used.",
        "The prompts, described above, are presented one at a time and the volunteer records each one individually.",
        "The recording is replayed and the volunteer verifies the quality or re-records.",
        "The user can stop and resume at any time.",
        "Prompts are provided to the volunteer in a random order; completed prompts will be included in the corpus even if the user does not record the full set.",
        "The app accesses the microphone of the user's mobile device and records 48 kHz PCM files, which are sent to a server developed and hosted by the Language Technologies Unit at Bangor University.",
        "Uploads are queued in the background so that network speed issues do not interrupt the recording process.",
        "56 Translation: Paldaruo Crowdsourcing a Welsh speech recognition corpus Help us to develop Welsh speech recognition.",
        "Contribute your voice through nattering into this app.",
        "Funders: S4C Welsh Government Begin > More information?",
        "Figure 1: Welcome screen in the Paldaruo App The app was evaluated in a pilot application (see 5) and proved successful in obtaining a useful speech corpus from invited volunteers.",
        "However issues were highlighted with regards to background noise and recording volume levels.",
        "To address this, the app now includes background noise and volume level checks.",
        "The official media launch of the app, with the final prompt set, will take place on 7th July 2014.",
        "There will be television coverage on S4C with high-profile individuals including the First Minister of Wales and celebrities providing endorsements and appeals for volunteers.",
        "5 Data Application 5.1 Pilot Data Application To date a small pilot speech corpus has been collected with the Paldaruo app covering the phonemes that appear in a vocabulary to control a robotic arm.",
        "20 speakers contributed to this corpus and recorded 38 prompts (approx.",
        "200 words) each, totalling around 4000 words.",
        "Certain commands, for instance ?up?, exhibit dialect-dependent lexical variation, and in these cases every speaker recorded both regional forms.",
        "Command: Translation: golau ymlaen light on gafael agor grip open gafael cau grip close arddwrn i fyny / arddwrn lan wrist up arddwrn i lawr wrist down penelin i fyny / penelin lan elbow up penelin i lawr elbow down ysgwydd i fyny / ysgwydd lan shoulder up ysgwydd i lawr shoulder down troi i?r dde turn to the right troi i?r chwith turn to the left This corpus has been used to develop a pilot speaker-independent Welsh-language speech recognition system for controlling the robotic arm.",
        "The pilot system uses HTK ([no date]) and Julius ([no date]), and follows the design of an existing English system (AonSquared, [no date]).",
        "It controls the robotic arm from a Raspberry Pi (a credit card-sized computer, popular in schools and coding clubs, costing around ?35; see (Raspberry Pi Foundation, [No date]).",
        "The authors hope this simple demonstration will be recreated in schools and coding clubs for children throughout Wales, fitting in with the Welsh 57 Government's aim to support initiatives aimed at encouraging and supporting young people to engage -- in the digital world in a Welsh-language context?",
        "(Welsh Government, 2013: 14).",
        "5.2 Licensing GALLU will follow the successful strategy of the WISPR project in using permissive open-source licensing.",
        "All outputs will be made available under the MIT licence (MIT, [No date]) which allows royalty-free use in both open-source and proprietary systems, including desktop computer software, web applications, mobile apps and embedded systems such as television set firmware.",
        "This strategy allows the widest possible use of the project's outputs, and the maximal availability of Welsh speech recognition technology.",
        "5.3 Application to other languages The authors hope other lesser-resourced languages can harness the project's outputs and experience.",
        "The source code of the Paldaruo crowdsourcing app can easily be adapted for use in other languages.",
        "The process for developing the LVCSR system has been documented and will be published in the form of a tutorial.",
        "All project outputs, including the source code for the app, will be available under the MIT licence.",
