        "Human memory is fundamentally associative.",
        "To focus just on lexical access issues, it is often the case that people cannot immediately recall a word expressing a specific concept but they can give one or more words referring to concepts associated with the desired one in their minds.",
        "The failure to retrieve a word from memory, combined with partial recall and the feeling that retrieval is imminent, is generally referred to as the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon (TOT), sometimes called presque vu (Brown, 1991).",
        "Before one starts to think about automatic means supporting the lexical access, it is important to distinguish various situations in which TOT appears.",
        "First, the personal state of the language producer (writer/speaker) plays a crucial role.",
        "Fatigue or lack of attention can increase frequency of TOT situations.",
        "Specific problems come with mild cognitive impairments (incipient dementia) which is more frequent in elders.",
        "The communication mode (written or spoken language) also needs to be taken into account ?",
        "it often helps to recollect an intended word if one just says associated words aloud.",
        "Conse-quently, people can prefer expressing the hesitation over a TOT word as a question to a family member, a friend or an automatic assistant.",
        "The spoken communication generally brings longer, more specific and detailed clues that can potentially lead to better identification of the word to be reminded.",
        "The language (mother tongue v. foreign language) and producer's familiarity and proficiency also need to be considered.",
        "Language learners would frequently associate a word with others that sound similar but are not related semantically, they could combine clues in their native language and the target one, mis-spell/mispronounce words, etc.",
        "Although the search across languages is not typically considered as a kind of the TOT phenomenon, we include this situation in the considered scenario.",
        "Research prototypes of automatic assistants have to consider the above-mentioned settings and clearly identify in what types of TOT they can help.",
        "The primary decision a tool designer needs to make relates to the appropriate interface.",
        "The ultimate goal of the work described in this paper consists in integrating a TOT-aware assistants into natural user interfaces.",
        "Rather than on a desktop or tablet computer with a standard keyboard or (hand)written input, we focus on smart-phones or even wearable interfaces (smart watches, glasses), intelligent home/office infrastructure components, or robotic companions that can communicate in natural (spoken) language and that help users in their language producing tasks.",
        "22 Although the current research deals strictly with explicitly expressed requests for a TOT-situation help, there is a possibility of automatic detection of TOT-related hesitations and immediate generation of word suggestions.",
        "In any case, the state of the art on this topic is at the beginning and these types of automatic assistants are mostly research prototypes.",
        "To be able to evaluate the ongoing development work, the first author of this paper started to document and collect real TOT events.",
        "This includes personal experiences but also cases appearing during his communication with colleagues, family members, etc.",
        "In a relatively short time of three months, 19 documented cases were recorded.",
        "This shows that a collective effort in this area could easily lead to a new reasonably-large resource that would help to direct future research (see the concluding section).",
        "As we aim at a general TOT setting, the collected data include full descriptions of the clues, not just keyword-based TOT searches.",
        "For written-only interfaces, we provide a list of extracted keywords too.",
        "Thus, there would the full sentence: It is like racism but on women (the correct answer ?",
        "discrimination) and the set of two keywords ?",
        "racism, women ?",
        "for the written case.",
        "Although its current limited size does not allow deriving statistically-significant results (only 3 out of 19 TOT cases can be correctly retrieved by our method if we allow 4 suggestions), the resource can be used to demonstrate crucial differences between the task of TOT- and reverse-association predictions (see the next section).",
        "In addition to this discussion, the paper presents methods used for the stimulus-response association prediction submitted as our contribution to the CogALex 2014 shared task and their results.",
        "Section 3 introduces the methods, while Section 4 summarizes results under varying parameters.",
        "We conclude with future directions of our research and a proposal for a joint TOT-related activity.",
        "2 Related Work There is a long-term interest in intelligent dictionary interfaces that reflect natural lexical-access needs.",
        "Yet, advanced mechanisms of the access by meaning are rarely implemented as their integration presents significant challenges.",
        "Zock and Bilac (2004) discuss lookup mechanisms on the basis of word associations.",

        "Free-word associations are frequently used as testing data for word relatedness experiments.",
        "Church and Hanks (1990) estimate word associations by a corpus-based association ratio.",
        "Word association thesauri or norms, representing a collection of empirical data obtained through large-scale psycholinguistic free-association tests, often define a gold standard.",
        "In particular, Zesch and Gurevych (2007) employ the University of South Florida word association, rhyme, and word fragment norms (Nelson et al., 1998) to compare characteristics of its graph representation to that of Wikipedia.",
        "Rapp (2008) experiments with associative responses to multiword stimuli on the Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus.",
        "The CogALex 2014 shared task is very close to the experimental setting discussed in (Rapp, 2013) which also aims at computing a stimulus word leading to responses given in EAT.",
        "A fixed-window size to count word co-occurrences is used first.",
        "Log-likelihood ratios are employed to rank candidate words and products of the ranks then define the winner.",
        "Providing 7 responses (as compared to 5 in the CogALex 2014 shared task), the stimulus word is predicted with 54 % accuracy.",
        "However, only a specific subset (Kent and Rosanoff, 1910) of EAT is used which comprises 100 words.",
        "It is also not fully clear from which set of potential words target answers are chosen.",
        "This is a crucial aspect that influences accuracy.",
        "For example, Rapp (2014) took into account only primary associative responses from EAT, i. e,.",
        "only 2,792 words.",
        "Obviously, it is far simpler to choose the correct answer from a limited set than from all existing words.",
        "Other word association resources are also frequently used as test data.",
        "In addition to the Wordnet itself, they include TOEFL (Landauer and Dumais, 1997) and ESL synonym questions (Turney, 2001), RG-65 (Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965) and WordSimilarity-353 (Finkelstein et al., 2001) test collections for degree of synonymy or SAT analogy questions (Turney et al., 2003) for the relational similarity.",

        "3 Free word associations v. TOT ?",
        "similarities and differences The CogALex 2014 shared task was motivated by natural lexical access but it was defined as computing reversed free-word associations.",
        "Participating automatic systems were employed to determine the most probable stimulus leading to given five most frequent responses from a free association test.",
        "For example, given words circus, funny, nose, fool, and fun, participating systems were supposed to compute word clown as the answer.",
        "Training and test datasets came from the Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus (EAT) 1 (Kiss et al., 1972).",
        "EAT comprises about 100 associative responses given by British students for each of 8,400 stimuli.",
        "Items containing multi-word units and non-alphabetical characters were filtered out from the CogALex 2014 experimental data.",
        "Although it has been shown that free word association norms and thesauri provide a valuable source of information for TOT-assisting (Sinopalnikova and Smrz, 2006), the two corresponding phenomena are not identical.",
        "Indeed, available data and experience clearly point out similarities but also significant differences.",
        "Both, individual free associations as well as TOT can be full of idiosyncrasies.",
        "However, while association norms and thesauri try to present prototypical, generalized, most frequent associations, TOT assistants need to cope with personal specificity.",
        "Ideally, a system should be able to help its user remind a word given the clue it was mentioned by Mary during our yesterday's conversation.",
        "Both the phenomena are also strongly culturally-dependent.",
        "Among others, this can make some resources such as large-scale corpora for particular language variants unusable.",
        "For example, let us consider the very first item from the CogALex test set ?",
        "word capable is to be guessed as the stimulus for responses able, incapable, brown, clever, good.",
        "Putting aside the first two response words sharing their roots with the stimulus for a while (see the related discussion below), we come to word brown.",
        "This refers to Lancelot Brown, more commonly known as Capability Brown ?",
        "an 18th century English landscape architect.",
        "This association is specific for the U.K. and it is hardly known to Americans.",
        "For example, the two words never collocate in the 450 million Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) 2 , while Capability Brown is mentioned 36 times in the 100 million British National Corpus (BNC) 3 .",
        "This observation led us to the question what is the overlap between two distinct word association the-sauri/norms.",
        "To explore this, we compared EAT to the University of South Florida Word Association Norm (SFWAN) 4 (Nelson et al., 1998).",
        "SFWAN consists of 5,019 normed words and their 72,176 responses.",
        "EAT and SFWAN have 3,545 stimulus terms in common.",
        "There are 11,788 words used as one or more responses in both the sets.",
        "Despite the substantial overlap of the stimulus and response sets, responses for same stimulus words in SFWAN rarely correspond to those given in EAT.",
        "Using a simple algorithm of the highest overlap among response sets, only 106 stimuli from the CogALex test set (out of 2,000) can be correctly determined from SFWAN.",
        "It can be partially explained by the cultural differences between the U.K. and the U.S.A., but also by relatively distant times of collecting/publishing the resources (1972 v. 1998), slightly different settings of the experiments and non-uniform presentation of the results.",
        "In any case, this finding casts doubts upon suitability of EAT for the shared task if no available (large) corpus data reflects the time and the setting of corresponding word association experiments (reflecting the background of students in 1972).",
        "It can be also argued that observed associations corresponding to TOT clue words are of different nature than (reversed) free-word associations.",
        "Definitely, numbers of given clues vary, sometimes, there are two or three words only, sometimes, there are full sentences giving more than 5 keywords to associate 1 http://www.eat.rl.ac.uk/ 2 http://corpus.byu.edu/coca/ 3 http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/ 4 http://web.usf.edu/FreeAssociation/ 24 with.",

        ".",
        ", it is used for.",
        ".",
        ".",
        ").",
        "Subjects are usually instructed to give the first response in their mind to the stimulus in free word association tests.",
        "On the other hand, TOT clues are usually related to the searched word in much more subtle way.",
        "At least, it is usually enough to mention any word of the same root/stem as a candidate and the subject finds the word in TOT situations.",
        "Thus, testing free associations such as choler-cholera, capable-incapable, misuse-abuse, actor-actress is completely irrelevant for vocabulary access problems.",
        "Native speakers have usually no problem to retrieve a word from memory if it forms a part of an idiom and the other part of the idiom is suggested.",
        "Thus, predicting either word of tooth a nail is not relevant for TOT situations (in any language that lexicalizes Latin dentibus et vnguibus).",
        "Considering lexical access in a foreign language, the reason for the same conclusion can be opposite ?",
        "an idiom can be unknown to a learner so that it is not probable that a part will be given as a clue.",
        "In languages naturally conceptualizing different parts of speech, writers or speakers always know what word category they search for.",
        "The collected data as well as intuition also suggest that TOT clues would not mix various senses of a word to be recalled.",
        "Consequently, free associations such as stage ?",
        "theatre/coach or March ?",
        "April/Hare have also nothing to do with TOT.",
        "4 Methods This section introduces methods used to compute multi-word reversed associations in our experiments.",
        "The primary method applied in the submitted system takes advantage of deep learning from web-scale corpora.",
        "To be sure that computed word associations automatically derived from large textual data cannot be matched by those resulting from a manually created resource, associations predicted by various Wordnet-based measures were also considered.",
        "The Word2Vec technique 5 available in Python package GenSim 6 ( ?",

        "Word2Vec defines an efficient way to work with continuous bag-of-word (CBOW) and skip-gram (SG) architectures computing vector representations from very large data sets (Mikolov et al., 2013).",
        "The CBOW and SG approaches are both based on distributed representations of words learned by neural networks.",
        "The CBOW architecture predicts a current word based on contexts, while the SG algorithm predicts surrounding words given a current word.",
        "Mikolov et al. (2013) showed that the SG algorithm achieves better accuracies in tested cases.",

        "Unrestricted systems could use any kind of data to compute results, while restricted systems were allowed only to draw on the freely available UKWaC corpus (Ferraresi et al., 2008) in order to predict word associations.",
        "We implemented systems for both the categories.",
        "Our unrestricted system employs the ClueWeb12 corpus.",
        "7 UKWaC comprises about 2 billion words and has size of about 30 GB (including annotations).",
        "The ClueWeb12 dataset consists of more than 733 million English web pages (collected between February and May 2012).",
        "The size of the complete ClueWeb12 data is 1.95 TB.",
        "To speed-up the process of training, only a fraction of the ClueWeb12 dataset was used to compute the Word2Vec models.",

        "Results for various combinations of parameters are summarized in Table 1.",

        "A strict evaluation comparing exact strings can then harm systems that do not try to match particular wordforms.",
