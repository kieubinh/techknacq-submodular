        "Semantic similarity is a complex concept which has been widely discussed in many research domains (e.g., linguistics, philosophy, information theory communication, or artificial intelligence).",
        "In natural language processing (NLP), two types of semantic similarity are identified: attributional and relational similarities.",
        "Until now, many researchers reported for measuring these similarities.",
        "Attributional similarity consists in comparing semantic attributes contained in each word.",
        "For ex-ample, the two words car and automobile share many attributes and, consequently, their attributional similarity is high , whereas the attributional similarity between car and drive is low.",
        "If the attributional similarity is high, this means that the words are structurally similar.",
        "Indeed, car and automobile are considered as synonyms because they share almost all of their structural attributes.",
        "Attributional similarity is not confined to synonymy but is also related to such relations as hypernymy/hyponymy.",
        "Relational similarity compares the semantic relations between pairs of words.",
        "For example, fish : fins :: bird : wings asserts that fish is to fins as bird is to wings: i.e., the semantic relations between fish and fins are highly similar to the semantic relations between bird and wings.",
        "To find the relational similarity between two words, knowledge resources such as WordNet (Miller, 1995) or Ontology (Suchanek et al., 2007) are generally used.",
        "Lexical syntactic patterns between two words also help in identifying relational similarity.",
        "For instance, the lexical syntactic patten -- is a?",
        "helps to identify hypernyms (Hearst, 1992; Snow et al., 2004).",
        "To measure the attributional similarity between words or the relational similarity between word pairs, Vector Space Models (VSM) are mainly used (Turney, 2005; Turney and Littman, 2005; Turney, 2006).",
        "The expressiveness of a vector space model differs in the way it is built the matrices.",
        "The different way to build the matrices is based on two types of associations.",
        "In this paper, we use two types of associations which are well-known in linguistics: syntagmatic associations and paradigmatic associations.",
        "Syntagmatic associations originate from word co-occurrences in texts.",
        "Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) relies on such syntagmatic associations.",
        "It has been successful at simulating a wide range of psychological and psycholinguistic phenomena, from judgments of semantic similarity (Landauer and ",
        "77 Dumais, 1997).",
        "Paradigmatic associations, however, reflect more the semantic attributes of words.",
        "Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL) (Lund and Burgess, 1996) is related to LSA, but also makes use of paradigmatic associations by capitalizing on positional similarities between words across contexts.",
        "LSA and HAL consider simply different types of space built from texts, and the differences are reflected in the structural representations formed by each model (Jones and Mewhort, 2007).",
        "In this paper, we propose a vector space model with both syntagmatic and paradigmatic associations to measure relational similarity between word pairs.",
        "The dimensions for each word pair in our proposed model show the distribution between words.",
        "To avoid data sparseness in the dimensions, we make use of a word clustering method in a preprocessing step.",
        "We then build our proposed model with syntagmatic and paradigmatic associations on the results of the clustering step.",
        "We conduct two experiments on SemEval-2012 task 2 and Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) analogy quizzes to measure relational similarity to evaluate our model.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "We describe similar research in Section 2.",
        "Our proposed vector space model to capture syntagmatic and paradigmatic associations is presented in Section 3.",
        "The experimental results and evaluations for relational similarity, and SAT analogy quizzes are shown in Section 4.",
        "We present our conclusions in Section 5.",
        "2 Related work A popular approach with vector space model for measuring similarities between words is to compute the similarities of their distribution in large text data.",
        "The underlying assumption is the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954): words with similar distribution in language should have similar meanings.",
        "The two main approaches, LSA and HAL, for producing word spaces differ in the way context vectors are produced.",
        "LSA with term-document matrices have a greater potential for measuring semantic similarity between words.",
        "LSA capitalizes on a word's contextual co-occurrence, but not on how a word is used in that context.",
        "HAL's co-occurrence matrix is a sparse word-word matrix.",
        "In HAL, words that appear in similar positions around the same words tend to develop similar vector representations.",
        "HAL is related to LSA, but HAL can be said to insist more on paradigmatic associations and LSA more on syntagmatic associations.",
        "Bound Encoding of the AGgregate Language Environment (BEAGLE) (Jones andMewhort, 2007) is a model that combines syntagmatic and paradigmatic associations.",
        "The BEAGLE model has two matrices for representing word meanings with syntagmatic and paradigmatic associations: one for order information and another one for contextual information.",
        "By combining the order information and contextual information, the BEAGLE model can express syntagmatic and paradigmatic associations.",
        "These models are built from word to word co-occurrences and word to document (context) co-occurrences, which measure only attributional similarity between words.",
        "We claim, however, that attributional similarity between words is of little value.",
        "For example, the attributional similarity between ?fish?",
        "and ?fins?",
        "is weak, and it is also the case between ?bird?",
        "and ?wings?.",
        "However, in terms of relational similarity, there is a high similarity between ?fish:fins?",
        "and ?bird:wings?.",
        "This shows that there may be more potentiality in comparing word pairs rather than simply words.",
        "Turney (2005) and Turney and Littman (2005) used an approach called Latent Relational Analysis (LRA) in which a vector space of distributional features was derived from a large Web corpus and then reduced using singular value decomposition (SVD).",
        "For measuring relational similarity, the similarity between two pairs is calculated by the cosine of the angle between the vectors that represent the two pairs in their approach.",
        "The main difference between LSA and LRA is the way the semantic space is built.",
        "In LSA, the word-document matrices are built for measuring attributional similarity between words as above mentions.",
        "In LRA, the pair-pattern matrices are built for measuring relational similarity between word pairs.",
        "As an extension, Turney (2008) designed the Latent Relation Mapping Engine (LRME), by combining ideas from the Structure Mapping Engine (SME) (Gentner, 1983) and LRA, to remove the requirement for hand-coded representations in SME.",
        "Here, we consider that syntagmatic and paradigmatic associations can adapted to pair-pattern matrices for measuring relational similarity.",
        "The extension of pair-pattern matrices are pair-feature matrices in our proposed model.",
        "78 3 Proposed model In this section, we describe our proposed pair-feature matrices which capture syntagmatic and paradigmatic associations.",
        "To build the pair-feature matrices, we consider that syntagmatic associations between words are co-occurrences and paradigmatic associations are substitutions between words in the same contexts.",
        "The direct use of such features leads to a large number of dimensions, which may result in data sparseness.",
        "Section 3.1 will be dedicated to the solution we propose to avoid this problem.",
        "We show how to build our pair-feature matrices with syntagmatic and paradigmatic associations in Section 3.2.",
        "3.1 Data sparseness A critical problem in statistical natural language processing is data sparseness.",
        "One way to reduce this problem is to group words into equivalence classes.",
        "Typically, word classes are used in language modeling to reduce the problem of data sparseness.",
        "The practical goal of our proposal is to achieve reasonable performance in measuring relational similarity and semantic proportional analogy from a small corpus.",
        "We will show that even small corpora have a great potential to measure similarity in actual tasks.",
        "Building a pair-feature matrices in such a setting obviously leads to sparseness since word pairs do not easily co-occur in the sentences of small corpora.",
        "We use clustering methods to cluster words into equivalence classes to reduce the problem.",
        "Here, we make use of monolingual word clustering (Och, 1999) 1 .",
        "This method is based on maximum-likelihood estimation with Markov model.",
        "We build our proposed pair-feature model described in Section 3.2 based on the results of word clustering.",
        "3.2 Vector Space Model (VSM) VSM (Salton et al., 1975) is an algebraic model for representing any object as a vector of identifiers.",
        "There are many ways to build a semantic space, like term-document, term-context, and pair-pattern matrices (Turney and Pantel, 2010).",
        "Turney (2006) showed that pair-pattern matrices are suited to measuring the similarity of semantic relations between pairs of words; that is, relational similarity.",
        "Conversely, word-context matrices are suited to measuring attributional similarity.",
        "In this paper, we build a vector space of pair-feature after preprocessing the training corpus by a word clustering method.",
        "In a pair-feature matrix, row vectors correspond to pairs of words, such as ?fish:fins?",
        "and ?bird:wings?, and column vectors correspond to the features grouped by the word clustering method.",
        "We set 3 ?",
        "N column vector size, N features annotated by the word clustering method described in previous section.",
        "The reason for setting the vector size to three times the number of features is to represent syntagmatic and paradigmatic associations in our proposed model.",
        "Our main original idea is to build a column vector of affixes.",
        "A sentence containing a word pair is divided into three parts: ?",
        "a prefix part, which consists in the word classes found around the first word of the word pair in the sentence in a window of a given size called the context window; ?",
        "an infix part, which consists in the word classes of the words found the words of between the word pair in the sentence; ?",
        "a suffix part, which consists in the word classes found around the second word of the word pair in the sentence in a window of a given size (context window); We suppose that prefixes and suffixes are paradigmatic features and that infixes are syntagmatic features.",
        "The paradigmatic features indirectly capture similar words around the first and the second words.",
        "By opposition, the syntagmatic features directly capture the syntactical pattern between a word pair.",
        "These features also characterize the syntactic structure of sentences.",
        "This model will deliver similar features for word pairs appearing in sentences exhibiting similar syntactic patterns.",
        "By combining syntagmatic and paradigmatic features in our proposed model, we can express these associations in one vector space.",
