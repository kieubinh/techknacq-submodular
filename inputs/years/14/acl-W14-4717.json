        "Chinese noun classifiers are an indispensible part of the Chinese language, but are difficult for non-native speakers to use correctly.",
        "Chinese language teachers often face challenges in finding an effective way to teach classifiers, as the rules for defining which nouns can be associated with which classifiers are not straightforward.",
        "Many theoretical studies have explored the nature of Chinese classifiers, but few studies take an empirical approach to the investigation of effective teaching and learning methods of classifiers.",
        "Learners often find that existing dictionaries either do not have classifiers as lexical entries, or give very brief explanations that are hardly helpful.",
        "This paper presents the progress of an ongoing project on the construction of an e-dictionary of Chinese classifiers.",
        "The objective of the project is to provide a platform for Chinese language learners to explore and learn classifier uses in a bottom-up fashion.",
        "The current work is on the design of an e-learning tool database and its connection to the e-dictionary database.",

        "As a classifier language, Chinese does not provide a way for its speakers to avoid using classifiers.",
        "That is, they are a compulsory grammatical element in a phrase structure.",
        "The basic construction of a classifier phrase has a numeral (e.g., y??",
        "?one?, sh??",
        "?ten?",
        "), or a determiner (e.g., zh`e ?this?, n`a ?that?",
        "), or a qualifier (e.g., j ?",
        "i ?several?, m?ei ?each?",
        "), placed before a classifier and a noun after it.",
        "Thus, a simple English noun phrase such as ?a book?",
        "needs to be expressed in Chinese with the classifier b?en in between the numeral y??",
        "and the noun, ?book?",
        "as y?",
        "?b?en sh?u.",
        "In brief, a classifier is a word or morpheme that is used to classify nouns based on their inherent semantic features.",
        "However, the semantics and the uses of Chinese classifiers have become far more complex than their syntactic structure looks.",
        "It is hard to define their lexical meanings and their uses seem to have rules to follow but violations are common.",
        "It is impossible for learners to make a correct choice of a classifier if they simply follow its grammatical rules.",
        "This is mainly because Chinese classifiers contain information about the features of the noun referents they can be associated with.",
        "However, most of the classifiers can be associated with a number of different types of nouns.",
        "Their noun-dependent meanings are inexplicit and ambigous.",
        "Conventional dictionaries give brief definitions of classifiers, which is a way to avoid complicated descriptions and lengthy listing of their associated nouns, but are of little help to language learners.",
        "Classifiers can be divided into different types based on their semantic functions.",
        "Some of them carry the unique features of the Chinese language; others are representational of classifier languages, and yet all of them have the functions of measure words.",
        "Regarding the differences between classifiers and measure words, Tai & Wang (1990) stated that ?A classifier categorizes a class of nouns by picking out some salient perceptual properties, either physically or functionally based, which are permanently associated with entities named by the class of nouns; a measure word does not categorize but denotes the quantity of the entity named by a noun?.",
        "This definition makes a clear distinction between a classifier and a measure word from a multi-dimensional perspective.",
        "Measure words are language universal while classifiers are ",
        "126 language specific.",
        "There is an ontological base on which classifiers and nouns are associated with (Sowa, 2000; Huang and Ahrens, 2003; Philpot et al., 2003; Nichols et al., 2005), while measure word associations with nouns could be simply based on the notion of quantification.",
        "Understanding the differences between the two concepts can help learners of Chinese increase their awareness of the semantic and cognitive bases of classifier associations with nouns (Gao, 2010; Gao, 2011; Quek and Gao, 2011).",
        "Due to the complexity of classifiers?",
        "functions, different definitions and classifications have been found.",
        "Some researchers define Chinese classifiers based on their grammatical functions.",
        "For exam-ple, Chao (1968) divided classifiers into nine categories.",
        "They are ?classifiers or individual measures?, ?classifiers associated with v-o?, ?group measures?, ?partitive measures?, ?container measures?, ?tempo- rary measures?, ?standard measures?, ?quasi-measures or autonomous measures?, and ?measures for verbs of action?.",
        "His classification shows that he did not distinguish between classifiers and measure words.",
        "The advantages of such a classification are that it includes all the types of classifiers mentioned above and that classifiers?",
        "measuring function is emphasized.",
        "But a big disadvantage is that the embedded meanings of the specific noun classifiers and the ontological nature of the noun referents that classifiers are associated with are largely ignored.",
        "This way of classification may help beginning learners to understand the basic functions of Chinese classifiers, but will not help more advanced learners.",
        "Yue (2009) took a different approach.",
        "He treated classifiers and measure words as quantifiers and divided those collected from corpus data into eleven categories based on the kinds of nouns the quantifiers are associated with.",
        "They were defined as quantifiers ?representing a group of people?, ?indicating groups of animals?, ?representing types?, ?representing individual thing or person?, ?representing a pair?, ?representing a set?, ?representing a huge amount of things?, ?representing a slight amount of things?, ?representing capacity?, ?representing weather?, and ?representing emotions?.",
        "Regardless of the unnecessary new term he used to refer to classifiers, his classification is more cognitively based and closer to language learners?",
        "knowledge of noun referents and their categories.",
        "Using computer technology to apply empirical research findings of classifier knowledge to natural language processing (NLP) has provided a new approach for the semantic analysis of classifiers (Nirenburg and Raskin, 2004; Hwang et al., 2008) and for computer-assisted language learning (Guo and Zhong, 2005).",
        "However, no e-learning systems developed so far have been found to be able to help language learners to use the semantic features of classifiers?",
        "associated nouns to learn classifiers systematically.",
        "Yet, the emergence of Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) has made it possible for language learners to explore various kinds of user-friendly and flexible e-learning tools (Davies, 2011).",
        "CALL incorporates technology into the language learning process and also applies itself across a broad spectrum of teaching styles, textbooks, and courses (Donaldson and Haggstrom, 2006).",
        "Its bidirectional and individualized features make it possible for learners to use it effectively to improve different aspects of language skills (Mallon, 2006; Chang et al., 2008).",
        "The idea of designing an e-dictionary of Chinese classifiers is similar to that of CALL.",
        "Findings from empirical studies on classifier learning provide a practical guideline in the process of the designing.",
        "In order to make the e-dictionary a useful learning tool for both beginning and advanced learners of Chi-nese, measure words and classifiers are both labelled as classifiers.",
        "However, in the feature descriptions learners can understand and identify the functions of the words categorically.",
        "Currently the dictionary database includes 859 classifiers collected from dictionaries and other resources.",
        "The number of associated nouns classified is currently 6420.",
        "Different tables (as sub-databases) are set up according to the classifications of classifiers and the nouns included.",
        "In addition to the conventional functions of a dictionary built up for the e-dictionary of classifiers, an e-learning system is implemented to allow learners at different levels to have a self-paced exploration of the relationships between a classifier and a noun or many nouns from different categories.",
        "In this paper the focus will be on the descriptions of the designs of the e-learning database and its interface.",
        "2 Classifier-based Classification of Noun Categories Classifiers must be used together with nouns to form classifier phrases but their associations with nouns are not contextually based nor are they of a free choice.",
        "The mapping can be complicated.",
        "A classifier 127 can be associated with a number of nouns from different categories and a noun can be mapped to more than one classifiers.",
        "For example, the classifier ti?ao enters into nine noun categories and the noun ch?e?car?",
        "can be associated with li`ang and t?ai as well.",
        "Learners may quickly feel intimidated when at a first trial to identify the possibilities of the multi associations.",
        "Therefore, in designing the database, instead of mapping classifiers to nouns directly, we make use of classifiers?",
        "noun-dependent features to first identify all the nouns that each classifier can be associated with and then classify the nouns into categories.",
        "So far eleven noun categories have been identified and classified as ?nature?, ?humans & body parts?, ?animals?, ?vegetables & fruits?, ?man-made objects?, ?buildings?, ?clothing?, ?food?,?furniture?, ?tools?, and ?vehicles?.",
        "A hierarchy of noun classifiers is built up according to the number of noun categories each classifier is associated with.",
        "These noun categories are not word classes defined with the principles in lexicology.",
        "They are defined based on the ontological categories of the noun referents of real-world entities, which are supposedly directly linked to learners?",
        "understanding of nouns and their referents of the language.",
        "Grouping classifiers?",
        "associated nouns into categories based on the ontological categories of noun referents is one of the special features of the design of this dictionary.",
        "The classifiers are set in a hierarchical order in the database according to the number of noun categories they enter into.",
        "The highest number of noun categories that a classifier has been identified as being associable with more than one noun categories is nine.",
        "Of all the classifiers in the database, about more than 50% of them are associated with more than three noun categories.",
        "The fewer noun categories a classifier is associated with, the easier it is assumed to be for learners to grasp.",
        "For example, the classifier li`ang occurs only in the category of vehicles, (e.g., car, lorry, bicycle, etc.).",
        "Learners generally do not confuse or misuse it for other types of nouns.",
        "Due to the differences in the mult-categorical associations, some classifiers are more commonly used than others.",
        "The nineteen classifiers listed in Table 1 are the ones that are associated with at least three noun categories and they are the most commonly used ones as well.",
        "In the analysis of linguistic categories, a cognitive approach defines categories by groups of features and relationships within certain linguistic domains.",
        "The occurrence of a noun with a particular classifier in a phrase structure is dependent upon the categorical features of both the noun and the classifier.",
        "However, the embedded semantic networks of the categories are not obviously well connected, which is mainly due to the diachronic and sociolinguistic changes of the Chinese language.",
        "As a result, native speakers?",
        "categorization dependent on not only noun referents?",
        "intrinsic properties but also their functional and human perceptual ones.",
        "In other words, classifier and noun associations encode as well human cognitive understandings of the real world entities.",
        "The use of classifiers has thus been found changed over time.",
        "More noun and classifier associations are found to be possible cross-categorically.",
        "That is, one single classifier can associate itself with a number of nouns from different noun categories and similarly, one single noun can also be associated with not one but two or three classifiers.",
        "This cross-categorization extension complicates the classification of classifiers to a great extent.",
        "Theoretically, it does not seem to be possible for linguists to build a meta-theory for a systematic organization of logically transparent classifier-noun categories and thus hard for lexicographers to find an effective way to illustrate the semantic relationships between classifiers and nouns.",
        "The main obstacle in classifier acquisition seem to be due to the fact that the the nature of the semantic meanings of classifiers is opaque.",
        "The complex classifier associations with nouns have consequently caused noun categorizations to be linguistically unconventional.",

        "the shape of the noun referents that is defined as ?longitudinal?.",
        "This shows that the classifier ti?ao is inhabited with this semantic feature and it is possibly the cognitive basis on which native speakers of Chinese associate it with the related noun referents accordingly.",

        "What needs to be further specified is to define each noun with a unique feature of its own, no matter whether it is from its lexical semantic meanings, pragmatic functions, or human perceptions.",
        "For example, in addition to the feature labelled as ?longitudinal?, -- for supporting walking?",
        "is added as a feature to ?stick?, ?a piece of human skeleton?",

        "Categorical records created as data files are used to store the associated nouns.",
        "The records created so far include eleven categories of nouns as are described in Section 2.",
        "Such a categorization appears explicit, but its top-down approach fails to reveal the feature-based mapping between a classifier and its associated nouns.",
        "The objective of the e-learning approach, on the other hand, is to guide users to search for correct classifier and noun pairs by looking for the defined features of the noun referents, firstly from those broadly defined as ?animacy?, ?shape?, ?size?, ?thickness?, ?length?, and ?function?",
        "to those specific ones extracted from each particular noun referent.",
        "With such a bottom-up approach, the e-dictionary allows users to learn to use the particularly interrelated features of a classifier and its associated noun referents in a case-by-case fashion.",
        "In this way learners can better understand the point that a classifier reflects the cognitive classification of its associated noun referents.",
        "Each individual record thus contains both general and specific information of a classifier and its associated nouns as data entries, The features decomposed from the noun referents are 130 Figure 1: Mapping among the tiers of classifiers, nouns, and defined features.",
        "defined and recorded as independent data entries linked to the e-learning tool.",

        "The aim of this project is to clarify the embedded relationships 134 between classifiers and their associated nouns so as to assist Chinese language learners in the acquisition of classifier phrases.",
        "At the first stage of the project, classifiers and their associated nouns were collected from dictionaries and other resources.",
        "A database for the e-dictionary part which contains the functions that are characteristic of conventional dictionaries was designed and set up.",
        "Learners can search for a classifier or a noun for their association as a classifier phrase.",
        "Then, a feature-based approach in designing the classifier e-dictionary was extended to an e-learning environment created for learners to explore.",
        "At the current stage, the task is on the design and setting up of an e-learning system attached to the e-dictionary.",
        "As an experiment, MySQL was used to build up the database shared by the conventional dictionary and the e-learning system.",
        "The structure of this database is formed in the way in which classifiers and nouns are stored in different tables but can be linked together.",
        "All the information stored in different tables was connected through respective grouping criteria which allow the data to be extended to the e-learning environemnt.",
        "One table contains one type of information, such as classifiers in character, classifiers in pinyin, definitions of classifiers, types of classifiers, classifier associated nouns in Chinese and English, categories of the associated nouns, and semantic features of the nouns.",
        "Every two tables share at least one common parameter, which enables cross-table search as described in Section 4.2.",
        "Such a design is able to boost the efficiency of the search function.",
        "In addition, the database can be enriched easily through MySQL code or phpMyAdmin to import new data.",
        "A web application for self-learning in the e-learning environment was designed using PHP language.",
        "It serves as an e-learning tool for learning Chinese classifiers.",

        "associated nouns and their classified categories.",
        "The feasibility of the functions of the e-learning tool and its web application need to be further improved.",
        "Currently there are a few limitations.",
        "For example, subjectivity is a limitation of this database.",
        "In the process of decomposing nouns into respective semantic features, human cognition plays an important role.",
        "However, this parameter varies from person to person.",
        "Moreoever, speakers of Chinese in different regions may tend to use different cognitive strategies in their associations with the semantic meanings of classifiers.",
        "Therefore, data from experiments and empirical studies are needed for the future improvement of the semantic analysis and descriptions of the noun-classifier associations.",
        "Another aspect to improve is that regional featured uses of certain classifiers such as Singaporean Chinese speakers?",
        "use of l`?",
        "with noun referents that are both big and small (e.g., ?watermelon?",
        "and ?bean?)",
        "can be explained and included in separate tables so that learners can be aware of the regional differences in classifier use.",
        "The advantages of the web application design are its multipurpose search functions and flexible links to the various parts of the database behind.",
        "With the various search functions, learners will be able to investigate classifiers from different aspects, which is ideal for self-learning.",
        "On the page of ?Searching a noun for its classifier(s)?, both Chinese and English entries are acceptable, which makes it easier for learners to explore and make a flexible use of its learning functions.",
        "However, on the page of ?Searching a classifier for its associated noun(s)?, only Chinese character entries are available.",
        "A future addition can be made to allow entries by Pinyin as well.",
        "For the database development in the future, the web application is designed to be linked to the database in a dynamical fashion.",
        "Any changes made to the database can be reflected on the web page automatically.",
        "This will also allow us to make further development without much of a change in the current layout in the e-learning system.",
        "6 Conclusion Based on the Chinese classifier e-dictionary of (Gao, 2011), designed to help students learn the proper use of Chinese classifiers, this paper further explores the designs of the database and of an e-learning tool interface to better understand the association of classifiers and nouns.",

        "noun-dependent features case by case.",
        "To make use of the advantage of internet, further investigation of another feature within a search can be made possible through hyperlinked text.",
        "The final goal is to make the outcome of this project available online as learning resources for the general public and as an e-learning tool for Chinese language learners.",
        "Further development of this project and explorations of other possible database designs are necessary as our end goal is to provide an effective learning tool.",
        "Experimental studies are also needed to discriminate the subjectivity of the descriptions of human congnition in the illustrations of classifier-noun associations.",
