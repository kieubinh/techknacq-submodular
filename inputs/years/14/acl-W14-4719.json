        "We compare four common lexical access approaches to aggregation, preferences, and constraints: bag-of-words, two different types of maximal alignment, and inversion transduction grammar based methods.",

        "For UMEANT (Lo and Wu, 2012), they are estimated in an unsupervised manner using relative frequency of each semantic role label in the references and thus UMEANT is useful when human judgments on adequacy of the development set are unavailable.",
        "3 Comparison of multiword expression association approaches To assess alternative lexical access preferences and constraints for computing multiword expression associations, we now consider four alternative approaches to defining the lexical similarities s i,pred and s i,j , all of which employ a standard context vector model of the individual words/tokens in the multiword expression arguments between the reference and machine translations, as descibed by Lo et al. (2012) and Tumuluru et al. (2012).",

(2006) who normalize phrasal similarities according to the phrase length.",
        "s i,pred = 1 2 (prece i,pred,fi,pred + recei,pred,fi,pred) s i,j = 1 2 (prece i,j ,f i,j + rece i,j ,f i,j ) 3.3 Maximum alignment (f-score) The second of the maximum alignment based approaches replaces the above linear averaging of precision and recall with a proper f-score.",
        "Although this is less consistent with the previous literature, such as Mihalcea et al. (2006), it seems more consistent with the overall f-score based approach of MEANT, and thus we include it in our comparison as a variant of the maximum alignment strategy.",

        "rece i,j ,f i,j prece i,j ,f i,j + rece i,j ,f i,j 3.4 Inversion transduction grammar based There has been to date relatively little use of inversion transduction grammars (Wu, 1997) to improve the accuracy of MT evaluation metrics?despite (1) long empirical evidence the vast majority of translation patterns between human languages can be accommodated within ITG constraints, and (2) the observation thatmost current state-of-the-art SMT systems employ ITG decoders.",
        "Especially when considering semanticMTmetrics, ITGs would seem to be a natural strategy for multiword expression association for several cognitively motivated reasons, having to do with language universal properties of cross-linguistic semantic frame structure.",
        "To begin with, it is quite natural to think of sentences as having been generated from an abstract concept using a rewriting system: a stochastic grammar predicts how frequently any particular realization of the abstract concept will be generated.",
        "The bilingual analogy is a transduction grammar generating a pair of possible realizations of the same underlying concept.",
        "Stochastic transduction grammars predict how frequently a particular pair of realizations will be generated, and thus represent a good way to evaluate how well a pair of sentences correspond to each other.",
        "The particular class of transduction grammars known as ITGs tackle the problem that the (bi)parsing complexity for general syntax-directed transductions (Aho and Ullman, 1972) is exponential.",
        "By constraining a syntax-directed transduction grammar to allow only monotonic straight and inverted reorderings, or equivalently permitting only binary or ternary rank rules, it is possible to isolate the low end of that hierarchy into a single equivalence class of inversion transductions.",
        "ITGs are guaranteed to have a two-normal form similar to context-free grammars, and can be biparsed in polynomial time and space (O ( n 6 ) time and O ( n 4 ) space).",
        "It is also possible to do approximate biparsing in O ( n 3 ) time (Saers et al., 2009).",
        "These polynomial complexities makes it feasible to estimate the parameters of an ITG using standard machine learning techniques such as expectation maximization (Wu, 1995b) .",
        "At the same time, inversion transductions have also been directly shown to be more than sufficient to account for the reordering that occur within semantic frame alternations (Addanki et al., 2012).",
        "This language universal property has an evolutionary explanation in terms of computational efficiency and cognitive load for language learnability and interpretability (Wu, 2014).",
        "ITGs are thus an appealing alternative for evaluating the possible links between both semantic role fillers in different languages as well as the predicates, and how these parts fit together to form entire semantic frames.",
        "We believe that ITGs are not only capable of generating the desired structural correspondences between the semantic structures of two languages, but also provide meaningful constraints to prevent alignments from wandering off in the wrong direction.",
        "Following this reasoning, alternate definitions of s i,pred and si,j can be constructed in terms of bracketing ITGs (also known as BITGs or BTGs) which are ITGs containing only a single non-differentiated 147 nonterminal category (Wu, 1995a).",
        "The idea is to attack a potential weakness of the foregoing three lexical association strategies, namely that word/token alignments between the reference and machine translations are severely underconstrained.",
        "No bijectivity or permutation restrictions are applied, even between compositional segments where this should be natural.",
        "This can cause multiword expressions of semantic role fillers to be matched even when they should not be.",
        "In contrast, using a bracketing inversion transduction grammar can potentially better constrain permissible token alignment patterns between aligned role filler phrases.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates how the ITG constraints are consistent with the needed permutations between semantic role fillers across the reference and machine translations for a sample sentence from the evaluation data.",
        "In this approach, both alignment and scoring are performed utilizing a length-normalized weighted BITG (Wu, 1997; Zens and Ney, 2003; Saers and Wu, 2009; Addanki et al., 2012).",

        "For both reference and machine translations, the ASSERT (Pradhan et al., 2004) semantic role labeler was used to automatically predict semantic parses.",
        "4.2 Results and discussion The sentence-level correlations in Table 1 show that the ITG based strategy outperforms other automatic metrics in correlation with human adequacy judgment.",
        "Note that this was achieved with no tuning whatsoever of the rule weights (suggesting that the performance could be further improved in the future by slightly optimizing the ITG weights).",
        "The ITG based strategy shows 3 points improvement over the next best strategy, which is maximal alignment under f-score aggregation.",
        "The ITG based approach produces much higher HAJ correlations than any of the other metrics.",
        "In fact, the ITG based strategy even comes within a few points of the human upper bound benchmark HAJ correlations computed using the human labeled semantic frames and alignments used in the HMEANT.",
        "Data analysis reveals two reasons that the ITG based strategy correlates with human adequacy judgement more closely than the other approaches.",
        "First, BITG constraints indeed provide more accurate phrasal similarity aggregation, compared to the naive bag-of-words based heuristics.",
        "Similar results have been observed while trying to estimate word alignment probabilities where BITG constraints outperformed alignments from GIZA++ (Saers and Wu, 2009).",
        "Secondly, the permutation and bijectivity constraints enforced by the ITG provide better leverage to reject token alignments when they are not appropriate, compared with the maximal alignment approach which tends to be rather promiscuous.",
        "The ITG tends whenever appropriate to accept clean, sparse alignments for role fillers, prefering to leave tokens unaligned instead of aligning them anyway as the other strategies tend to do.",
        "Note that it is not simply a matter of lowering thresholds for accepting token alignments: Tumuluru et al. (2012) showed that the competitive linking approach (Melamed, 1996) does not work as well as the strategies considered in this paper, whereas the ITG appears to be selective about the token alignments in a manner that better fits the semantic structure.",
