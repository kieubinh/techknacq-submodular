        "We present a morphological model implemented in order to feed the French Lexical Network database?",
        "hereafter fr-LN?, presently under development at the ATILF CNRS lab.",
        "The fr-LN belongs to the broad family of lexical resources designed as networks of lexical units (Fellbaum, 1998; Baker et al., 2003; Ruppenhofer et al., 2010; Spohr, 2012).",
        "Its design, content and mode of construction has already been documented in various publications (Lux-Pogodalla and Polgu?re, 2011; Gader et al., 2012; Polgu?re, 2014; Polgu?re, to appear) and we strictly focus here on its newly developed morphological component.",
        "The morphological description of French lexemes discussed below possesses two main characteristics: 1. it is dynamically created from a full-fledged grammatical model of French inflectional morphology; 2. it is meant to be used in the context of a lexicographic project where morphological tables are individually associated to senses of (polysemic) vocables, thus accounting for potential morphological discrepancies between senses within a given vocable.",
        "We believe that our approach allows for a cognitively sound implementation of morphology in lexical databases that are primarily oriented towards the description of senses (rather than forms).",
        "Indeed, we do not simply inject lists of lexical forms into the fr-LN database but describe morphological knowledge by means of a ?true?",
        "model of French inflectional morphology.",
        "154 1.1 Interconnection between lexical and morphological models There are at least two main characteristics that a cognitively sound lexical model of a given language has to possess.",
        "?",
        "First and foremost, it must account for the Speaker's knowledge of lexical rules (a lexical unit and all its properties being considered here as being a cluster of lexical rules).",
        "?",
        "Second, it must be structured in a way that makes it possible to support the modeling of (i) ?natural?",
        "processes of lexical knowledge evolution?acquisition, consolidation, relativization, loss of lexical knowledge -- and (ii) linguistic processes of speech, understanding, paraphrase, translation, word association (Dunbar, 2012), etc.",
        "Lexical knowledge, however, is intricately related to grammatical knowledge, to the point that it is not necessarily possible to radically separate lexical information from grammatical information in a cognitive lexicon.",
        "This is particularly true for language morphology, that can be said to belong simultaneously to both the lexical and grammatical modules of natural languages.",
        "Consequently, a lexical model that aims at cognitive relevance has to take the morphological bull by the horns and handle morphological properties and behavior of lexical units by modeling actual morphological knowledge.",
        "Not all lexical resources link a lexical unit to its forms and morphology is often ?externalized,?",
        "using separate dedicated resources (see section 1.2 below).",
        "However, for a language that is rather rich in terms of inflectional morphology, such as French, it is particularly interesting to embed in lexical resources an explicit morphological model.",
        "The purpose of such model is to allow lexicographers to account for inflected forms of lexical units by associating each individual unit (= sense) to inflectional classes and dynamically obtain in the process morphological tables of all corresponding lexical forms.",
        "Before we proceed, let us enumerate the basic terminology that will be used throughout the paper.",
        "?",
        "Lexical units are of two kinds: (i) lexemes?CHEVAL I.1a ?horse?",

        "1.2 Current approaches to morphology in sense-oriented lexical databases In this section, we briefly summarize the treatment of morphological information in major sense-oriented lexical databases and explain why we decided to elaborate an approach of our own.",
        "Our initial constraints were that we wanted to truly handle forms related to lexemes with respect to general rules of inflectional morphology.",
        "Additionally, we wanted to model in an elegant way phenomena such as spelling variation (cuill?re ?spoon?",
        "?",

        "?",

        "To our knowledge, no current general purpose lexical database -- for French or other languages?",
        "currently meet these requirements.",
        "WordNet, for instance, only stores base forms of lexemes and has no embedded morphological model of English.",
        "An external lemmatizer, Morphy, 1 is used to access lexical senses via inflected forms.",
        "The situation is different in FrameNet.",
        "As indicated in (Ruppenhofer et al., 2010, p. 93?94), lemmas are stored in the Lexical Database component of FrameNet, together with corresponding wordforms.",
        "However, no grammatical model of inflection is embedded in the database and made available for lexicographic purposes.",
        "1 https://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/man/morphy.7WN.html 155 2 Dynamic approach to morphological description This section is devoted to the presentation of the morphological model embedded in the fr-LN.",
        "We proceed in two steps.",
        "Firstly (section 2.1), we detail the limitations of existing morphological databases for French, which explain why we decided to not ?inject?",
        "their content in the fr-LN.",
        "Secondly (section 2.2), we present the general design of our morphological model and detail its dynamic nature.",
        "2.1 Limitations of existing morphological resources for French In order to model ?morphological knowledge?",
        "within a lexical database, one can either make use of an already existing morphological ressource (that will be connected to or embedded into the database), or develop a specific, tailor-made morphological database module?see (Issac, 2010) for a detailed discussion.",
        "There exist indeed several morphological resources for French that, in principle, could have been used as embedded morphological modules in the fr-LN.",
        "We will explain why limitations found in these resources have led us to choose the second option and design our own morphological model.",
        "We have mainly examined six morphological resources for French, all developed during the past ten years: Manulex, Morphalou, Lexique 3, Lefff, Flexique and Morfetik.",
        "2 Here is a brief recap of the observations we have made, based on our specific needs and expectations.",
        "For lack of space, we cannot make a detailed presentation of these resources and our evaluation will by necessity be rather sketchy.",
        "Manulex was designed for psycholinguistic research (L?t?",
        "et al., 2004).",
        "It contains 48,886 French wordforms.",
        "The list of wordforms results from a ?grade-based word frequency list extracted from a corpus of first to fifth grade readers used in French elementary schools?",
        "(L?t?",
        "et al., 2004, p. 159).",
        "Manulex has therefore a limited coverage, when compared to other existing resources that target the bulk of the French lexicon and can store up to 500,000 forms.",
        "But coverage is not the only issue.",
        "The quality of data can vary greatly from database to database.",
        "In Morphalou (Romary et al., 2004), for instance, one can find a lot of miscategorizations and misspellings.",
        "Reusing Morphalou's data would thus raise many maintenance issues.",
        "While having a larger coverage than Manulex and data of better quality than Morphalou, Lexique 3 (New, 2006) poses several problems of its own.",
        "First, inflectional paradigms are not complete, because Lexique 3's wordlist was extracted from the Frantext corpus (Mont?mont, 2008), that contains only part of the lexicon of contemporary French.",
        "Second, pairs like chat ?cat?",
        "?",
        "chatte ?female cat?",
        "have been encoded as one entry, which contradicts our theoretical and descriptive choices.",
        "Following (Mel?",
        "?",
        "cuk, 2000; Delaite and Polgu?re, 2013), we consider that no inflectional mechanism is involved here.",
        "There are two distinct CHAT ?",
        "CHATTE nominal lexemes in French; the feminine is morphologically derived (i.e. produced by morphological derivation) from the masculine and has to be accounted for separately.",
        "Both aspects?incompleteness and inapropriate descriptive postulates such as in the case of N masc ?",
        "N fem pairs?disqualified Lexique 3 in our quest for an already-existing resource.",
        "Flexique (Bonami et al., 2013) is derived from Lexique 3, but the problems we just mentioned are solved: paradigms are now complete and pairs like CHAT ?",
        "CHATTE have been encoded as two separate entries.",
        "However, Flexique?just as the two remaining resources Lefff 3 (Sagot, 2010) and Morfetik (Mathieu-Colas, 2009)?lacks alternative forms for inflections 4 or orthographic variants, as reported by the authors themselves.",
        "Last but not least, all resources cited above associate a morphological description to a lexical entry, not to a specific sense.",
        "However, not all senses of a given polysemic vocable necessarily possess the same morphological behavior, and this is valid for most of natural languages.",
        "For instance, the sense ?flag or other symbolic object?",
        "of the COLOR vocable is plural only (to raise the colors).",
        "In other words: 2 These resources are all available for research.",
        "The dictionaries of the Antidote suite incorporate a powerful morphological model for French (Antidote, 2014).",
        "However, Antidote is a commercial product; we cannot examine its internal design and its morphological model is of course not available for embedding in a lexical database such as fr-LN, whose linguistic content will be freely available.",

        "4 For instance, these resources do not indicate that Fr.",

        "has two alternative plural forms ails ?",

        "In this respect, and to our knowledge, there exists no sense-based morphological model available for French prior to our work.",
        "This left us with no choice but to design a model of our own, that would be specially designed to accompany our lexicographic project and be better suited for applications such as word sense identification backed by lexical knowledge (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998).",
        "2.2 General design of the fr-LN dynamic morphological model The core of our morphological model is a set of Morphological Templates that define corresponding inflection classes as Prototypical Tables of inflection.",
