        "Terminological resources have traditionally focused on terms referring to entities, thereby ignoring other important concepts (processes, events and properties) in specialized fields of knowledge.",
        "Consequently, large parts of the conceptual structure of these fields are not taken into consideration nor represented.",
        "In this article, we show how terms that refer to processes and events (and, to a lesser extent, properties) can be characterized using Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1982) and the methodology developed within the FrameNet project (Ruppenhofer et al., 2010).",
        "More specifically, we applied the framework to a subset of terms in the field of the environment.",
        "Frames are unveiled first by comparing similarities between the argument structures of terms already recorded in a terminological database and the relationships they share with other terms.",
        "A comparison is also carried out with the lexical units recorded in FrameNet.",
        "Then, relations between frames are defined that allow us to build small conceptual scenarios that are specific to the field of the environment.",
        "These relations are determined on the basis of the set of relations listed in the FrameNet project.",
        "This article reports on the methodology, the frames defined up to now and two specific conceptual scenarios (Risk_scenario and Managing_waste)."

        "Traditionally, terminological resources have been designed as knowledge repositories and until recently the focus has been placed on finding ways to represent the knowledge conveyed by terms.",
        "In fact, in several terminological applications, terms are viewed as the linguistic components of knowledge structures (i.e. linguistic labels attached to nodes that represent concepts).",
        "This perspective has led to the design of domain ontologies (or less formal structures) in which concepts are linked via a network of relations (is-a, part-of, cause-effect, etc) and terms are disambiguated linguistic labels assigned to these concepts.",
        "However, it has been pointed out that, although interesting, these knowledge structures have important drawbacks as far as linguistic aspects are concerned: 1.",
        "They tend to focus on terms that denote entities (expressed by nouns) and little consideration is given to processes and events; 2.",
        "Other types of units that could be relevant for terminology, such as predicative terms (that designate processes, events and properties) are not represented in a way that fully captures their meaning; 3.",
        "They either overlook the linguistic properties of terms altogether, or linguistic properties (such as variation) are taken into account in a peripheral component of the representation.",
        "An increasing number of researchers proposed alternative methods to add linguistic components to terminological knowledge structures (Faber, 2006, 2012; Montiel et al., 2010, among others).",
        "Others have developed methods to describe terms as linguistic units with frameworks designed for the lexicon in general.",
        "An interesting aspect of this latter work is the consideration given to terms that have been overlooked in knowledge structures, i.e. predicative terms and more specifically verbs (Condamines 1993; Lerat 2002; L?Homme 1998; Lorente 2002).",
        "It is generally recognized that both the relationship with knowledge and linguistic properties are important aspects of terminological description, and methods should be developed to merge them into resources.",
        "However, it seems that terminologists still struggle to find an adequate balance between conceptual and linguistic representations (L?Homme, 2014).",
        "One possible solution resides in frames or frame-like representations that attract the interest of an increasing number of researchers (Dolbey et al., 2006; Faber, 2006, 2012; Schmidt 2009, among others, see Section 3).",
        "186 This is the solution we chose in this paper.",
        "More specifically, we applied principles based on Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1982, 1985; Fillmore and Baker, 2010) and the methodology developed within the FrameNet project (Fillmore et al., 2003; Ruppenhofer et al., 2010) to linguistic data related to the field of the environment.",
        "A first part of this work was reported in L?Homme et al. (2014), in which frames were defined based on the contents of a resource containing environment terms (e.g., change, impact, recycle).",
        "In this paper, we summarize our methodology to discover frames, and report on what has been done to define relations between frames and build conceptual scenarios that represent processes and events in the field.",
        "We then describe two specific scenarios that apply to the field of the environment (Risk_scenario and Managing_waste).",
        "2 Theoretical assumptions and motivations Processes and events represent an important part of the set of concepts to be represented in many fields of knowledge.",
        "This is the case in environment where events (e.g., ?storm?, ?melt?, and ?warming?)",
        "and processes (e.g., ?damage?, ?threaten?)",
        "can be observed.",
        "However, traditional terminological models (and even less traditional ones, such as ontological representations) are not properly equipped to describe these concepts and account for their specific linguistic properties, namely the fact that they require arguments (X changes Y; impact of X on Y).",
        "Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1982; Fillmore and Baker, 2010) and its related application FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al., 2010) are specifically adapted to account for these concepts and offer different means to represent their conceptual as well as their linguistic properties.",
        "Frame Semantics (FS) is based on the assumption that the meanings of lexical units (LUs) are constructed in relation to background knowledge, whose structure can be analyzed in terms of semantic frames.",
        "Frames are conceptual scenarios in which different participants (called frame elements, FEs) appear.",
        "For instance, the Criminal_investigation frame is defined as follows in FrameNet: This frame describes the process that involves the determination by an authority, the Investigator, of the circumstances surrounding an Incident by means of inquiry.",
        "The frame states that there are three obligatory participants in this scenario (FEs): Investigator, Incident, and Suspect (other non-obligatory participants ?",
        "non-core FEs ?",
        "are also listed).",
        "Lexical units such as clue.n, inquire.v, inquiry.n, investigate.v, investigation.n evoke this frame.",
        "These lexical units and their participants are also annotated in selected sentences, thus linking the conceptual and linguistic representations levels of the description, as shown below for the verb investigate: ?",
        "NP police, sheriff, officer-T-(1) About 30 adults were arrested in raids on ten Children of God homes on Wednesday night by [Investigator police] INVESTIGATING Target [Incident claims of child abuse].",
        "[Suspect INI] [Investigator Anti-terrorist officers] were quickly on the scene and INVESTIGATING Target [Incident the further reports of suspect devices].",
        "[Suspect INI] ?",
        "T-NP allegation-(1) The Botswana government says that [Investigator it] will INVESTIGATE Target [Incident the torture allegations].",
        "[Suspect INI] ?",
        "T-NP case-(1) [Investigator The union] is also INVESTIGATING Target [Incident a number of cases of child labour and the sexual abuse of children by employers].",
        "[Suspect INI] Frames can share relationships with other frames as shown in Figure 1.",
        "Criminal_investigation is a subframe of Crime_scenario, it is preceded by Committing_crime and precedes Criminal_process.",
        "We believe that frames are well suited to represent the properties of predicative terms: annotations serve to capture their linguistic properties and link these properties to an abstract representation level, i.e. the frame.",
        "Furthermore, and this is what is explored in this paper, relations between frames, can help unveil larger conceptual scenarios in which these terms are involved.",
        "In FrameNet, some subject-specific frames can already be found, as shown below (Figure 1) with Crime_scenario and other related frames.",
        "187 We assume that this can be applied to the frames of a specialized field such as the environment.",
        "However, we believe that the specialized lexicon will display some characteristics that will result in the necessity to define specific frames and perhaps specific scenarios.",
        "We explore this on a subset of data that is presented in Section 4.",
        "3 Related work In addition to projects aiming to describe the general lexicon in English (FrameNet, 2014), and in other languages, such as German, Japanese, and Spanish (Boas, 2009), an increasing number of researchers in terminology or related fields suggest that Frame Semantics (FS) or compatible frameworks are well suited to describe terms.",
        "In Dolbey et al. (2006), Frame Semantics is adapted in order to develop frames in the field of biomedicine and link these frames to existing ontologies.",
        "Another application in medicine can be found in Wandji et al. (2013) where authors attempt to discover frames in the field with natural language processing techniques and an external resource (a medical terminology).",
        "Schmidt (2009) introduced some adaptations to the original framework of FS to account for multilingual data (English, French and German) in the field of soccer.",
        "Pimentel (2013) used the framework to establish equivalence relationships between English and Portuguese verbs in the field of law.",
        "L?Homme (2012) describes an annotation module added to two terminological resources (computing and environment) that is based on the annotation methodology developed within the FrameNet project.",
        "Finally, Faber (2012) refers to FS in order to account for concepts in the field of the environment and proposes a general frame (the environment event) to represent the interrelated processes and events observed in the field.",
        "The proposal has led to an approach in terminology called Frame-based terminology.",
        "The work reported in this article bears some similarities with and differs from the work cited above in the following ways: 1.",
        "Contrary to some of this work, frames are discovered after terms are described rather than postulated prior to the descriptive work (we took a strictly bottom-up approach); 2.",
        "Frames are defined by observing similarities between terms (Sections 4.2 and 4.3); 3.",
        "Relations between frames are based on those already defined in FrameNet, but they must be valid from the point of view of the field of the environment.",
        "Hence, some differences are likely to be observed with similar frames appearing in FrameNet or with frames defined for other fields of knowledge.",
        "4 Methodology This section describes the data used in this work (extracted from a terminological database), and the different steps taken to unveil semantic frames and relations between them.",
        "4.1 The terminological database Our analysis is based on data recorded in an existing terminological database that contains terms in the field of the environment (it covers four subfields: climate change, residual material management, Figure 1.",

        "In this work, we took into account verbs, nouns (that refer to events or processes) and a small set of adjectives (e.g., Eng.",

        "A subset of 169 English terms and 205 French terms underwent the analysis described in the following subsections.",
        "4.2 Annotated contexts In the database, several predicative terms (and all those that were selected for this analysis) come with up to 20 annotated sentences.",
        "The annotation is based on the methodology developed within the FrameNet project (Ruppenhofer et al., 2010).",
        "The original objectives of the annotations were twofold: 1.",
        "Show how actants (i.e. arguments) stated in the actantial (i.e. argument) structure are realized linguistically; 2.",
        "Supply terminologists writing entries with linguistic evidence to support their intuitions.",
        "In annotations (Figure 3), the predicative unit appears in capital letters and in bold.",
        "Participants are divided into two different types: actants (in bold) correspond to obligatory participants (roughly equivalent to FN's core frame elements); circumstants are non-obligatory participants (that correspond roughly to non-core FEs).",

        "The methodology, based on principles borrowed from Frame Semantics and its implementation in FrameNet, was applied to English and French terms that are related to the field of the environment.",
        "It allowed us to unveil frames that are similar to those recorded in FrameNet, but also new ones that might be specific to the specialized field we chose to describe.",
        "It also allows us to represent small conceptual scenarios.",
