        "The modelling of the semantics of adjectives is notoriously challenging.",

        "The use of first order logic (hence also description logics), while effective for nouns and verbs, breaks down in the case of adjectives.",
        "We argue that this is primarily due to a lack of logical expressivity in the underlying ontology languages.",
        "In particular, beyond the straightforward intersective adjectives, there exist gradable adjectives, requiring fuzzy or non-monotonic semantics, as well as operator adjectives, requiring second-order logic for modelling.",
        "We consider how we can extend the ontology-lexicon interface as realized by extant models such as lemon in the face of the issues mentioned above, in particular those arising in the context of modelling the ontological semantics of adjectives.",
        "We show howmore complex logical formalisms that are required to capture the ontological semantics of adjectives can be backward engineered into OWL-based modelling by means of pseudo-classes.",
        "We discuss the implications of this modelling in the context of application to ontology-based question answering."

        "Ontology-lexicon models, such as lemon (Lexicon Model for Ontologies) (M c Crae et al., 2012) model the semantics of open class words by capturing their semantics with respect to the semantic vocabulary defined in a given ontology.",
        "Such ontology-lexica are built around the separation of a lexical layer, describing how a word or phrase acts syntactically and morphologically, and a semantic layer describing how the meaning of a word is expressed in a formal logical model, such as OWL (Web Ontology Lan-guage) (Deborah L. M c Guinness and others, 2004).",
        "As such, the modelling is based around a lexical entry which describes the morphology and syntax of a word, and is linked by means of a lexical sense to an ontology entity defined in a given ontology described in formal logic.",
        "It has been shown that this principle known as semantics by reference (Buitelaar, 2010) is an effective model that can support the task of developing question answering systems (Unger and Cimiano, 2011) and natural language generation (Cimiano et al., 2013) over backends based on Semantic Web data models.",
        "The Pythia system, which builds on the lemon formalism to declaratively capture the lexicon-ontology interface, for exam-ple, has been instantiated to the case of answering questions from DBpedia (Unger and Cimiano, 2011).",
        "However, as has been shown by the Question Answering over Linked Data (Lopez et al., 2013, QALD) benchmarking campaigns, there are many questions that can be asked over this database that require a deeper representation of the semantics of words, adjectives in particular.",
        "For example, questions such ",
        "198 as (1a) require understanding of the semantics of ?high?",
        "in a manner that goes beyond the expressivity of OWL.",
        "The formalization of this question as an executable query formulated with respect to the SPARQL query language is provided in (1b).",
        "In particular, the interpretation of this question involves the formal interpretation of the word ?high?",
        "as relating to the property dbo:elevation, including ordering and subset selection operations.",
        "1.",
        "(a) What is the highest mountain in Australia?",
        "(b) SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { ?uri rdf:type dbo:Mountain .",
        "?uri dbo:locatedInArea res:Australia .",
        "?uri dbo:elevation ?elevation . }",
        "ORDER BY DESC(?elevation) LIMIT 1 In the above query, we select an entity denoted by the query variable ?uri that has the properties that i) the entity's type is a mountain, ii) it is located in Australia, and iii) it has an elevation bound to the variable ?elevation.",
        "We then sort the query in descending order by the value of the elevation and limit so the query returns only the first result, in effect choosing the largest value in the data set.",
        "It has been claimed that first-order logic and thus by extension description logics, such as OWL, ?fail decidedly when it comes to adjectives?",
        "(Bankston, 2003).",
        "In fact, we largely agree that the semantics of many adjectives are difficult or impossible to describe in first-order logic.",
        "However, from the point of view of the ontology-lexicon interface, the logical expressivity of the ontology is not a limiting factor.",
        "In fact, due to the separation of the lexical and ontology layers in a model such as lemon, it is possible to express the meaning of words without worrying about the formalism used in the ontology.",
        "To this extent, we will first demonstrate that adjectives are in general a case where the use of description logics (DL) breaks down, and for which more sophisticated logical formalisms must be applied.",
        "We then consider to what extent this can be handled in the context of the ontology-lexicon, and introduce pseudo-classes, that is OWL classes with annotations, which we use to express the semantics of adjectives in a manner that would allow reasoning with fuzzy, high-order models.",
        "To this extent, we base our models on the previously introduced design patterns (M c Crae and Unger, 2014) for modelling ontology-lexica.",
        "Finally, we show how these semantics can be helpful in practical applications of question answering over the DBpedia knowledge base.",
        "2 Classification of adjectives There are a number of classifications of adjectives.",
        "First we will start with the most fundamental distinction between attributive and predicative usage, that is the use of adjectives in noun phrases (?X is a A N?)",
        "versus as objects of the copula (?X is A?).",
        "It should be noted that there are many adjectives for which only predicative or attributive usage is allowed, as shown in (3a) and (3).",
        "2.",
        "(a) Clinton is a former president.",
        "(b) ?",
        "Clinton is former.",
        "3.",
        "(a) The baby is awake.",
        "(b) ?",
        "The awake baby.",
        "One of the principle classifications of the semantics of adjectives (for example (Partee, 2003; Bouillon and Viegas, 1999; Morzycki, 2013b)) is based on the meaning of adjective noun compounds relative to the meaning of the single words that form the compound.",
        "This classification is as follows (where ?",
        "denotes entailment).",
        "Intersective (X is a A N ?",
        "X is A ?",
        "X is a N ) Such adjectives work as if they were another noun and indicate that the compound noun phrase is a member of class denoted by the noun and the class denoted by the adjective.",
        "For example, in the phrase ?Belgian violinist?",
        "it refers to a person in the class intersection Belgian ?",
        "V iolinist(X), and hence we can infer that a ?Belgian violinist?",
        "is a subclass of a ?Belgian?.",
        "Furthermore, we could conclude that if the same person were a surgeon, he/she would also be a ?Belgian Surgeon?.",
        "199 Subsective (X is a AN ?",
        "X is a N , but X is a A N ??",
        "X is A) Such adjectives acquire their specific meaning in combination with the noun the modify.",
        "For example, a ?skilful violinist?",
        "is certainly in the class V iolinist(X) but the described person is ?skilful as a violinist?, but not skilful in general, e.g. as a surgeon.",
        "Privative (X is a A N ??",
        "X is a N ) These adjectives modify the meaning of a noun phrase to create a noun phrase that is potentially incompatible with the original meaning.",
        "For example, a ?fake gun?",
        "is not a member of the class of guns.",
        "Another important distinction is whether adjectives are gradable, i.e. whether a comparative or superlative statement with these adjectives makes sense.",
        "For example, adjectives such as ?big?",
        "or ?tall?",
        "can express relationships such as ?X is bigger than Y ?.",
        "However it is not possible to say that one individual is ?more former?.",
        "Most gradable adjectives are subsective (e. g.?a big mouse?",
        "is not ?a big animal?",
        "(Morzycki, 2013a)).",
        "Finally, we consider operator or property-modifying adjectives.",
        "They can be understood along the lines of privative adjectives but differ in that they represent operators that modify some property in the qualia structure (Pustejovsky, 1991) of the class.",
        "For instance, we may express the adjective ?former?",
        "in lambda calculus as a function that takes a class C as input and returns the class of entities that were a member of C to some prior time point t (Partee, 2003): ?C[?x?tC(x, t) ?",
        "t < now] Such adjectives have not only a difference in semantic meaning but can also frequently have syntactic impact, for example in adjective ordering restrictions, as they may be reordered with only semantic impact (Teodorescu, 2006), e.g., 4.",
        "(a) A big red car.",
        "(b) ?",
        "A red big car.",
        "5.",
        "(a) A famous former actor.",
        "(b) A former famous actor.",
        "Finally, we define object-relational adjectives as those adjectives which have a meaning that expresses a relationship between two individuals or events 1 , for example: 6.",
        "He is related to her.",
        "7.",
        "She is similar to her brother.",
        "8.",
        "This is useful for something.",
        "3 Representation of adjectives in the ontology-lexicon interface In general it is assumed that adjectives form frames with exactly one argument except for extra arguments provided by adjuncts, typically prepositional phrases.",
        "Most adjectives are thus associated with a predicative frame, which much like the standard noun predicate frame (X is a N ) is stereotyped in English as: X is A The attributive usage of an adjective is associate to a stereotypical frame where the N?",
        "argument is not semantically bound, but can instead be obtained by syntactic unification to a noun predicate frame: X is A N?",
        "As such, when we encounter the attributive usage of an adjective such as in 9, we understand this as the realization of two frames, given in 10.",
        "9.",
        "Juan is a Spanish researcher.",
        "10.",
        "(a) Juan is a researcher.",
        "(b) Juan is a Spanish N?",
        "Note that we do not provide modelling for adjectives where the meaning is unique for a particular noun phrase, such as ?polar bear?, which we would capture as a normal noun phrase with meaning ursus maritimus.",
        "1 Our definition of relational here is borrowed from the idea of relational nouns (De Bruin and Scha, 1988) as a word that requires an argument.",
        "Our definition is also different from the one for ?relational adjectives?",
        "as proposed by (Morzycki, 2013a).",
        "200 Figure 1: Modelling of an intersective adjective ?Belgian?",
        "in lemon 3.1 Intersective adjectives Intersective adjectives are the most straightforward class, as in many cases they can be modelled essentially as a noun or verb (e.g. deverbal adjectives such as ?broken?).",
        "Intersective adjectives take one argument and can thus be modelled as unary predicates in first-order logic or classes in OWL, as described by M c Crae and Unger (2014).",
        "For practical modelling examples, we will use the lemon model, since it is the most prominent implementation of the ontology-lexicon interface.",
        "The primary mechanism of modelling the syntax-semantics interface in the context of lemon is by means of assigning a frame as a syntactic behaviour of an entry and giving it syntactic arguments, which can then be linked to the lexical sense, which stands proxy for a true semantic frame in the ontology.",
        "For example, the modelling of an adjective such as ?Belgian?",
        "can be achieved as follows (depicted in Figure 1) 2 .",
        "lexicon:belgian a lemon:LexicalEntry ; lemon:canonicalForm belgian:Lemma ; lemon:synBehavior belgian:AttrFrame , belgian:PredFrame ; lemon:sense belgian:Sense .",
        "belgian:Lemma lemon:writtenRep \"Belgian\"@eng .",
        "belgian:AttrFrame lexinfo:attributiveArg belgian:AttrSynArg .",
        "belgian:PredFrame lexinfo:copulativeArg belgian:PredSynArg .",
        "belgian:sense lemon:reference [ a owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty dbpedia:nationality ; owl:hasValue dbpedia:Belgium ] ; lemon:isA belgian:AttrSynArg , belgian:PredSynArg .",
        "In this example, the word ?Belgian?",
        "is associated with a lemma with representation ?Belgian?, two frame objects and a lexical sense.",
        "The frame objects describe the attributive and predicative usage, and are associated with an attributive and copulative argument respectively.",
        "The sense links the word to the anonymous ontological class for objects that have ?Belgium?",
        "as the value of their ?national- ity?",
        "property and furthermore the arguments of each frame are linked to the sense in order to establish a correspondence between the ontology class and the syntactic frames.",
        "Note that here we use the external vocabulary defined in the LexInfo ontology (Cimiano et al., 2011) to define the meaning of the arguments of the frame as the attributive argument, corresponding to the frame stereotype ?X is A N??",
        "and the copulative argument for the frame stereotype ?X is A?.",
        "Furthermore, the 2 We assume that the namespaces are defined for the lexicon as lexicon, e.g., http://www.example.org/lexicon and for the entry, e.g., belgian is http://www.example.org/lexicon/belgian#.",
        "Other namespaces are assumed to be as usual.",
        "201 class of Belgians is not named in our reference ontology DBpedia, so we introduce an anonymous class with the axiomatization, i.e. ?",
        "nationality .Belgium.",
        "It is in fact common that the referent of an adjective is not named in an ontology.",
        "An obvious choice is thus to model denominal adjectives as classes of the form ?",
        "prop.Value, where Value is an individual that represents the semantics of the noun from which the adjective was derived.",
        "This modelling is so common that it has already been encoded as two design patterns, called IntersectiveObjectPropertyAdjective and IntersectiveDatatypePropertyAdjective (see (M c Crae and Unger, 2014)).",
        "Simi-larly, most deverbal adjectives refer to an event, and as such a common modelling is of the form ?",
        "theme ?1 .EventClass.",
        "For example, ?vandalized?",
        "may be ?",
        "theme ?1 .VandalismEvent.",
        "3.2 Gradable adjectives and relevant observables Gradable adjectives have a number of properties which differentiate them from intersective adjectives: ?",
        "They occur in comparative constructions, in English with either ?-er?",
        "or ?more?",
        "(Kennedy and Mc-Nally, 1999), e.g. ?smaller?",
        "and ?more frequent?, as opposed to intersectives such as ?",
        "*less geologi-cal?",
        "and ?",
        "*more wooden?.",
        "?",
        "Gradable adjectives can be defined as ?scalar?, since their value can ideally be measured on a scale of set degrees ?",
        "They have a context-dependent truth-conditional variability, meaning that their positive form is understood in relation to the class of the object modified by the adjective.",
        "For example, an ?expensive watch?",
        "has a different price scale to an ?expensive bottle of water?.",
        "?",
        "They are frequently fuzzy (or vague) (Kennedy, 2007).",
        "?",
        "There may be a minimum or maximum of the adjective's scale, which can be determined by, for example, whether they can modified by adverbs such as ?completely?",
        "or ?utterly?.",
        "As such, we define gradable adjectives relative to a particular property.",
        "These adjectives are also called ?observable?",
        "(Bennett, 2006) 3 as they are related to some observable or measurable property, e.g. size in the case of ?big?.",
        "However, a specification of the observable property is clearly not sufficient to differentiate between the meaning of antonyms such as big and small.",
        "Thus, we introduce the notions of covariance and contravariance, which specify whether the comparative form indicates a higher property value for the subject or the object.",
        "In this sense ?big?",
        "is covariant with size, as bigger things have a higher size value, and ?small?",
        "is contravariant with size.",
        "4 We also introduce a third concept, i.e. the one of absolute gradability, which expresses the fact that the degree of membership in the denotation of the adjective is stronger the more it approaches a prototypical or ideal value.",
        "A common example of this is colours, where we may say that some object is redder than another if it is closer to some ideal value of red (e.g., RGB 0xff0000).",
        "While these notions can handle the comparative structure of the semantics of adjectives, the predicative and superlative usage of adjectives is complicated by three factors that we will outline below.",
        "We notice that gradable classes are not crisply defined like in the case of many intersective adjectives.",
        "In fact, while we can clearly define all people in the world as ?Belgian?",
        "or ?not Belgian?, according to whom holds a Belgian passport or not, it is not easy to split the world's population into ?tall?",
        "and ?not tall?",
        "(This is known as sorites paradox (Bennett, 2006)).",
        "Furthermore, while it may be easy to say that someone with height 6?6?",
        "(198cm) is ?tall?, it is not clear whether someone with height 6?",
        "(182cm) is ?tall?, although compared to an average (different) height for a man, they are ?taller?.",
        "As such, one frequently used way to deal with this class of vague adjectives (and nouns) is via fuzzy logic (Goguen, 1969; Zadeh, 1975; Zadeh, 1965; Dubois and Prade, 1988; Bennett, 2006).",
        "Secondly, we notice that these class boundaries are non-monotonic, that is that with knowledge of more instances of the relative class we must revise our class boundaries.",
        "This is especially the case for superlatives, as the discovery of a new tallest person 3 Note that in many cases the property is quite abstract such as in ?breakable?.",
        "4 The use of these terms is borrowed from type systems, and resembles the concept of ?converse observables?",
        "as introduced by ((Bennett, 2006):42).",
        "As stated by the author, adjectives often come in pairs of polar opposites (e. g. conv(tall) = short, and both refer to the same observable (in this case size).",
        "Some observables analogously hold converse relationships with other observables (e. g. conv(flexibility) = rigidity or conv(tallness) = shortness).",
        "202 in the world would remove the existing tallest person in the world from the class of tallest person in the world.",
        "This non-monotonicity also affects the class boundaries of the gradable class itself.",
        "For example, in the 18th century, the average height of a male was 5?5?",
        "(165cm) 5 ; as such a male of 6?",
        "would have clearly been considered tall.",
        "It follows from this that each instance added to our ontology might lead to a revision of the class boundaries of a gradable class, hence leading to the fact that gradable adjectives are fundamentally non-monotonic.",
        "We must also notice that gradability can only be understood relative to the class that we wish to grade.",
        "Thus, while it is a priori unclear whether 6?",
        "is tall for a male, it is clear that 6?",
        "is tall for a female given the current average height of a female being about 5?4?",
        "(162cm).",
        "We can therefore conclude that gradable adjectives are fuzzy, non-monotonic and context-sensitive, all of which are incompatible with the description logic used in OWL.",
        "Pseudo-classes in lemonOILS Currently there are only limited models for representing fuzzy logic in the context of the Web (Zhao and Boley, 2008).",
        "In order to capture the properties of gradable adjectives, we introduce a new model which we name lemonOILS (The lemon Ontology for the Interpretation of Lexical Semantics) 6 .",
        "This ontology introduces three new classes: ?",
        "CovariantScalar, indicating that the adjective is covariant with its bound property ?",
        "ContravariantScalar, indicating that the adjective is contravariant with its bound property ?",
        "AbsoluteScalar, indicating that the property represents similarity to an absolute value In addition, the following properties are introduced to enable the description of gradable adjectives.",
        "Note that all these properties are typed as annotation properties in the OWL ontology, so that they do not interfere with the standard OWL reasoning.",
        "?",
        "boundTo indicates the property that a scalar refers to (e.g., ?size?",
        "for ?big?)",
        "?",
        "threshold specifies a sensible minimal value for which the adjective can be said to hold ?",
        "absoluteValue is the ideal value of an absolute scalar ?",
        "degree is specified as weak, medium, strong or very strong, corresponding to approximately 50%, 25%, 5% or 1% of all known individuals ?",
        "comparator indicates an object property that is equivalent to the comparison of the adjective (e.g., an object property biggerThan may be considered a comparator for the adjective class big) ?",
        "measure indicates a unit that can be used as a measure for this adjective, e.g., ?John is 175 centimetres tall?.",
        "Using such classes we can capture the semantics of gradable adjectives syntactically but not formally within an OWL model.",
        "As such, we call these introduced classes pseudo-classes.",
        "An example of modelling an adjective such as ?high?",
        "is given below (and depicted in Figure 2).",

        "or not), it is fuzzy (given by the strength of the probability of the proposition big C (x)), and it is context-sensitive (as whether an individual counts as big or not depends on the class C).",
        "Furthermore, our definition does not rely on defining ?big?",
        "for a given class, but instead is inferred from some known number of instances of this class.",

        "The supervaluation theory and SUMO Another way to capture the meaning of these vague terms can be achieved by supervaluation semantics.",
        "Through supervaluation theory, the modelling or positioning of sorites vague concepts is grounded in a judgement or meaning that lies on arbitrary thresholds, but these thresholds are based on a number of relevant objective measures (Bennett, 2006).",
        "A recent extension of the SUMO ontology (Niles and Pease, 2001, Suggested Upper Merged On-tology) 7 includes default measurements (currently amounting to 300+) added to the Artifacts, Devices and Objects enlisted in the ontology (and marked with capitals).",
        "The compilation of defaultMeasurements in SUMO has been just conducted on observables, not on predicates.",
        "Given for instance an Artifact such as Book, the compilation of its default measurements would look like: ;;Book (defaultMinimumHeight Book (MeasureFn 10 Inch)) (defaultMaximumHeight Book (MeasureFn 11 Inch)) (defaultMinimumLength Book (MeasureFn 5.5 Inch)) (defaultMaximumLength Book (MeasureFn 7 Inch)) (defaultMinimumWidth Book (MeasureFn 1.2 Inch)) (defaultMaximumWidth Book (MeasureFn 5.5 Inch)) 7 www.ontologyportal.org 204 The example for Book shows that the default measurements for the observable reflect a standard kind of book, i.e., one of the most commonly known kinds of the same artifact.",
        "As for this case, SUMO implies Book to be a physical object with a certain length, height and width (and possibly weight).",
        "A weakness here is that the there is no systematic connection between the defaultMinimumHeight and Height or Width, since these physical properties have been defined in SUMO just in terms of first-order logic, and have not been assigned default measurements yet.",
        "With lemonOILS we can add this information as follows: sumo:Book oils:default [ oils:defaultFor sumo:height ; oils:defaultMin \"10in\" ; oils:defaultMax \"11in\" ] .",
        "Then, if we understand a lexical entry ?high?",
        "as referring to a scalar covariant pseudo-class for sumo:height, it is possible to understand that a ?high?",
        "object exceeds the default minimum set established for the same object and owns at the same time a value for ?high?",
        "which does not go beyond the established default maximum.",
        "A further weakness of this approach is captured by the following example: 12.",
        "Avery Johnson is a short basketball player.",
        "Here, we see the difficulty in interpreting the sentence, as Avery Johnson is in fact of average height (5?10?)",
        "but for the class of basketball players he is unusually short.",
        "While SUMO has some very specific listings of subsets for the same Artifact 8 , SUMO does not provide a well-structured subset net for e. g. Person.As a way to address this bottleneck, we could introduce default values for every subclass of Person, as well as to introduce default values for the same Artifact in conjunction with a predicate or adjective (e. g. BigPerson, BulkyPerson).",
        "The creation of such ad hoc subclasses is not feasible in general, as we would have to introduce a new class into the ontology for every combination of an adjective and a noun.",
        "On the other side though, the SUMO default measurements serve the purpose they were originally conceived for, namely to be an arbitrary, yet computable approximation of physical measures.",
        "3.3 Operator adjectives Operator adjectives are those that combine with a noun to modify the meaning of the noun itself.",
        "There are two primary issues with the understanding of the adjective in this manner.",
        "Firstly, the reference of the lexical item does not generally refer to an existing item in the ontology, but rather is novel and productive, in the sense that it generates a new class.",
        "Secondly, the compositional nature of adjective-noun compounds is no longer simple, as in the cases of intersective and gradable adjectives.",
        "This means that, in order to understand a concept such as a ?fake gun?, we must first derive a class of FakeGuns from the class of Guns.",
        "Thus the modified noun phrase must be an argument of the operator adjective.",
        "To this extent we claim that it is not generally possibly to represent the meaning of an operator adjective within the context of an OWL ontology.",
        "Instead, following Bankston (Bankston, 2003), we claim that the reference of an operator adjective must be a higher order predicate.",
        "If we assume that there are operators of the form of a function, then the argument of an operator is the attributed noun phrase.",
        "As such, we introduce a frame operator attributive, that has one argument which is the noun.",
        "Thus we understand that the interpretation of ?fake gun?",
        "is by means of an operator fake, which is a function that takes a class and produces a new class, i.e., [fake(Gun)](X).",
        "Capturing such an operator lies beyond the expressivity of first-order logic.",
        "To fully capture the semantics of such an operator adjective, formalisms beyond first-order logic are thus clearly needed.",
        "3.4 Object-relational adjectives Object-relational adjectives are those that require a second argument, such as ?known?, which can only be understood as being ?known?",
        "to some person, in comparison to ?famous?.",
