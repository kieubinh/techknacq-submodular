        "Terminology plays an important role in various NLP tasks including Machine Translation (MT) and Information Retrieval.",
        "It is also exploited in human translation workflows, where it plays a key role in ensuring translation consistency and reducing ambiguity across large translation projects involving multiple files and translators over a long period of time.",
        "The creation of monolingual and bilingual terminological resources using human experts are, however, expensive and time-consuming tasks.",
        "In contrast, automatic terminology extraction is much faster and less expensive, but cannot be guaranteed to be error-free.",
        "Accordingly, in real NLP applications, a manual inspection is required to amend or discard anomalous items from an automatically extracted terminology list.",
        "The automatic terminology extraction task starts with selecting candidate terms from the input domain corpus, usually in two different ways: (i) linguistic processors are used to identify noun phrases that are regarded as candidate terms (Kupiec, 1993; Frantzi et al., 2000), and (ii) non-linguistic n-gram word sequences are regarded as candidate terms (Deane, 2005).",
        "Various statistical measures have been used to rank candidate terms, such as C-Value (Ananiadou et al., 1994), NC-Value (Frantzi et al., 2000), log-likelihood comparison (Rayson and Garside, 2000), and TF-IDF (Basili et al., 2001).",
        "In this paper, we present our bilingual terminology extraction model, which is composed of two consecutive and independent processes: 1.",
        "A log-likelihood comparison method is employed to rank candidate terms (n-gram word sequences) independently from the source and target sides of a parallel corpus, 2.",
        "The extracted source terms are aligned to one or more extracted target terms using a Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation (PB-SMT) model (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "We then evaluate our novel bilingual terminology extraction model on various domain corpora considering English-to-Spanish and low-resourced and less-explored English-to-Hindi language-pairs and see excellent performance for all data sets.",
        "42 The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we discuss related work.",
        "In Section 3, we describe our two-stage terminology extraction model.",
        "Section 4 presents the results and analyses of our experiments, while Section 5 concludes, and provides avenues for further work.",
        "2 Related Work Several algorithms have been proposed to extract terminology from a domain-specific corpus, which can be divided into three broad categories: linguistic, statistical and hybrid.",
        "Statistical or hybrid approaches dominate this field, with some of the leading work including the use of frequency-based filtering (Daille et al., 1994), NC-Value (Frantzi et al., 2000), log-likelihood and mutual information (Rayson and Gar-side, 2000; Pantel and Lin, 2001), TF-IDF (Basili et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2009), weirdness algorithm (Ahmad et al., 1999), Glossex (Kozakov et al., 2004) and Termex (Sclano and Velardi, 2007).",
        "In this work, we focus on extracting bilingual terminology from a parallel corpus.",
        "He et al. (2006) demonstrate that using log-likelihood for term discovery performs better than TF-IDF.",
        "Accordingly, similarly to Rayson and Garside (2000) and Gelbukh et al. (2010), we extract terms independently from both sides of a parallel corpus using log-likelihood comparisons with a generic reference corpus.",
        "Some of the most influential research on bilingual terminology extraction includes Kupiec (1993), Gaussier (1998), Ha et al. (2008) and Lefever et al. (2009).",
        "Lefever et al. (2009) proposed a sub-sentential alignment-based terminology extraction module that links linguistically motivated phrases in parallel texts.",
        "Unlike our approach, theirs relies on linguistic analysis tools such as PoS taggers or lemmatizers, which might be unavailable for under-resourced languages (e.g., Hindi).",
        "Gaussier (1998) and Ha et al. (2008) applied statistical approaches to acquire parallel term-pairs directly from a sentence-aligned corpus, with the latter focusing on improving monolingual term extraction, rather than on obtaining a bilingual term list.",
        "In contrast, we build a PB-SMT model (Koehn et al., 2003) from the input parallel corpus, which we use to align a source term to one or more target terms.",
        "While Rayson and Garside (2000) and Gelbukh et al. (2010) only allowed the extraction of single-word terms, we focus on extraction of up to 3-gram terms.",
        "3 Methodology In this section, we describe our two-stage bilingual terminology extraction model.",
        "In the first stage, we extract monolingual terms independently from either side of a sentence-aligned domain-specific parallel corpus.",
        "In the second stage, the extracted source terms are aligned to one or more extracted target terms using a PB-SMT model.",
        "3.1 Monolingual Terminology Extraction The monolingual term extraction task involves the identification of terms from a list of candidate terms formed from all n-gram word sequences from the monolingual domain corpus (i.e. in our case, each side of the domain parallel corpus, cf.",
        "Section 4.1).",
        "On both source and target sides, we used lists of language-specific stop-words and punctuation marks in order to filter out anomalous items from the candidate termlists.",
        "In order to rank the candidate terms in those lists, we used a log-likelihood comparison method that compares the frequencies of each candidate term in both the domain corpus and the large general corpus used as a reference.",
        "1 The log-likelihood (LL) value of a candidate term (C n ) is calculated using equation (1) from Gelbukh et al. (2010).",
        "LL = 2 ?",
        "((F d ?",
        "log(F d /E d )) + (F g ?",
        "log(F g /E g ))) (1) where F d and F g are the frequencies of C n in the domain corpus and the generic reference corpus, respectively.",
        "E d and E g are the expected frequencies of C n , which are calculated using (2) and (3).",
        "E d = N n d ?",
        "(F d + F g )/(N n d + N n g ) (2) E g = N n g ?",
        "(F d + F g )/(N n d + N n g ) (3) 1 Before the term-extraction process begins, we apply a number of preprocessing methods including tokenisation to the input domain corpus and the generic reference corpus.",
        "43 where N n d and N n g are the numbers of n-grams in the domain corpus and reference corpus, respectively.",
        "Thus, each candidate term is associated with a weight (LL value) which is used to sort the candidate terms: those candidates with the highest weights have the most significant differences in frequency in the two corpora.",
        "However, we are interested in those candidate terms that are likely to be terms in the domain corpus.",
        "Gelbukh et al. (2010) used the condition in (4) in order to filter out those candidate terms whose relative frequencies are bigger in the domain corpus than in the reference corpus, and we do likewise.",
        "F d /N n d > F g /N n g (4) In contrast with Gelbukh et al. (2010), we extract multi-word terms up to 3-grams, whereas they focused solely on extracting single word terms.",
        "3.2 Creating a Bilingual Termbank We obtained source and target termlists from the bilingual domain corpus using the approach described in Section 3.1.",
        "We use a PB-SMT model (Koehn et al., 2003) to create a bilingual termbank from the extracted source and target termlists.",
        "This section provides a mathematical derivation of the PB-SMT model to show how we scored candidate term-pairs using the PB-SMT model.",
        "We built a source-to-target PB-SMT model from the bilingual domain corpus using the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "In PB-SMT, the posterior probability P(e I 1 |f J 1 ) is directly modelled as a (log-linear) combination of features (Och and Ney, 2002), that usually comprise M translational features, and the language model, as in (5): log P(e I 1 |f J 1 ) = M ?",

        "The LLC is also the second-best performing algorithm on the EMILLE and the Lauchpad corpora.",
        "We see in Table 6 that the percentage of valid source terms is quite low on the EMILLE corpus.",
        "This might be caused by it containing information leaflets in a variety of domains (consumer, education, housing, health, legal, social), which might bring down the percentage of valid source terms on this corpus.",
        "Note that the percentage of valid source terms (VST) reported in Table 3 is calculated taking the top-100 source terms from the bilingual term-pair list that were extracted using the method described in Section 3.2.",
        "For comparison purposes we again report this percentage (VST in Table 3) in the second row in Table 6.",
        "Our bilingual term extraction method discards any anomalous pairs from the initial candidate term-pair list (cf.",
        "Section 3.2).",
        "This essentially removes some of the source entries that are not pertinent to the domain.",
        "As a result, the percentage of the valid source terms extracted applying our bilingual terminology extraction method (Table 3) is higher than the percentage of the valid source terms extracted applying our monolingual terminology extraction algorithm (LLC) (Table 6).",
        "We clearly see from Tables 3 and 6 that this bilingual approach to term extraction not only achieves remarkable performance on the bilingual task, but that when used in a monolingual context it outperforms most state-of-the-art extraction algorithms, and is comparable with the best ones.",
        "We should also note that JATE's implementation of these algorithms (including Weirdness) uses language-dependent modules such as a lemmatizer, unlike our implementation of LLC which is language-independent.",
        "5 Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we presented a bilingual multi-word terminology extraction model based on two independent consecutive processes.",
        "Firstly, we employed a log-likelihood comparison method to extract source and target terms independently from both sides of a parallel domain corpus.",
        "Secondly, we used a PB-SMT model to align source terms to one or more target terms.",
        "The manual evaluation results on ten different domain corpora of two syntactically divergent language-pairs showed the accuracy of our bilingual terminology extraction model to be very high, especially in the light of the rather noisier monolingual candidate terms presented to it.",
        "Given the reported high levels of performance ?",
        "minimum levels of 93.1% and 94.9% in the 4-best set-up across all six domains for English-to-Spanish and all four domains for English-to-Hindi, respectively ?",
        "we are convinced that the extracted bilingual multiword termbanks are useful ?as is?, and with a small amount of post-processing from domain experts would be completely error-free.",
        "The proposed bilingual terminology extraction model has been tested on a highly investigated language-pair, English-to-Spanish, and a less-explored and low-resourced English-to-Indic language-pair, English-to-Hindi.",
        "Interestingly, the performance of the bilingual terminology extraction model is excellent for the both language-pairs.",
        "We also tested several state-of-the-art monolingual terminology extraction algorithms including our own (log-likelihood comparison) on the source-side of the four English-to-Hindi domain data sets.",
        "According to the manual evaluation results, our monolingual multiword term extraction model proves to be the best-performing algorithm on two domain data sets and the second best-performing algorithm on the remaining two domain data sets.",
        "Our monolingual multiword terminology extraction method is clearly comparable to the state-of-the-art monolingual terminology extraction algorithms.",
        "In this work, we considered all n-gram word sequences from the domain corpus as candidate terms.",
        "49 In future work, we would like to incorporate the candidate phrasal term identification model of Deane (2005), which would omit irrelevant multiword units, and help us extend our evaluation beyond the top-100 terms.",
        "We also plan to demonstrate the impact of the created termbanks on translator productivity in a number of workflows ?",
        "different language pairs, domains, and levels of post-editing ?",
        "in an industrial setting.",
