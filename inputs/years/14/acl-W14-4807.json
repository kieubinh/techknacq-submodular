        "The annotated terms are marked as either valid or invalid, and valid terms are further classified as technology and non-technology terms.",
        "Technology terms signify methods, algorithms, and solutions in computational linguistics.",

        "Evaluation of these methods?as described in Vivaldi and Rodr?",
        "?guez (2007) and Nazarenko and Zargayouna (2009) -- is inherently a difficult task.",
        "Regardless of the employed metric and method for the performance comparison of CT algorithms, however, choosing a shared dataset consisting of a fixed set of documents?which can be accessed freely and easily -- is a major step towards alleviating a number of obstacles in the evaluation process.",
        "From a mathematical perspective, changes in the document set will alter the underlying distribution of words and terms in the benchmark dataset.",
        "Consequently, this can vary the performance of methods.",
        "From perspectives that involve meaning interpretation, as described in L?Homme (2014), terms are defined against a context.",
        "This context is the representative of a specialized subject field and reflects the requirements of the intended application for the extracted terms.",
        "In an evaluation dataset, the specialized subject field is largely defined by the set of documents in this dataset.",
        "Therefore, variation in the set of documents can result in variant set of terms.",
        "Creating datasets for benchmarking CT techniques have been addressed in several research efforts.",
        "The GENIA corpus is a well-known example of such reference datasets in bio-text mining: a corpus of 2000 abstracts from scientific publications in biological literature that is accompanied by the annotations of 100,000 terms organized in a well-defined ontology (Kim et al., 2003).",
        "The Colorado Richly Annotated Full Text Corpus (CRAFT) is another example of a bio-text mining dataset, which consists of 97 articles from the PubMed Central Open Access subset annotated with biomedical concepts such as ?mouse genes?",

        "52 The use of these datasets for CT research and terminology extraction has one obstacle: the minimal prerequisite knowledge that is required to understand these specialized discourse and literature.",
        "This understanding of text is, perhaps, essential to enable a CT researcher to first comprehend and then describe a linguistic phenomenon.",
        "Hence, conducting research in these specialized fields requires a training for terminologists.",
        "For example, research in bio-text mining is often conducted by a team that includes experts in biology, bioinformaticians and computational linguists who have specialized training in this field.",
        "Conducting CT research in these specialized domains, therefore, may not be the first choice for computational linguists who have a keen interest and specialized knowledge in the computational analysis of languages?or want to train themselves to gain this knowledge.",

        "The ACL RD-TEC is drawn from the ACL ARC (Bird et al., 2008).",
        "The ACL ARC is a fixed set of scholarly publications in the domain of computational linguistics.",
        "It has been developed with an aim to provide a platform for benchmarking methods of scholarly document processing.",
        "2 We report further processes and annotations that have been carried out on the ACL ARC in order to move a step closer to a reference dataset of familiar materials for the CT research community.",
        "Before describing the dataset, Section 2 delineates the terms that are used in this paper and gives a brief summary of computational terminology.",
        "In Section 3, we explain the automatic and manual processes performed to create the ACL RD-TEC and summarize the statistics of the current release.",
        "Finally, we conclude and describe our goals for the immediate future in Section 4.",
        "2 Computational Terminology Computational terminology inherits its complexity from the difficulties in the interpretation of meaning in language.",
        "In terminology, these complications are often summarized by the question ?what counts as a term??",
        "The Oxford Dictionary defines a term as ?a word or phrase used to describe a thing or to express a concept, specially in a particular kind of language or branch of study?.",
        "According to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), a term is ?a verbal designation of a general concept in a specific subject field (ISO 1087-1(2000))?.",
        "As stated by Cabr?e (2010), linguistically, terms are lexical units and carry a special meaning in particular contexts.",
        "A lexical unit is often considered as a lexical form?a single token, part of a word, a word or a combination of these?that is paired with a single meaning and serves as the basic element of a lan-guage's vocabulary.",
        "As stated by L?Homme (2014), terms are the denomination of items of knowledge, i.e. concepts.",
        "According to their lexical forms, terms are usually classified as simple or complex.",
        "Simple terms consist of one token; complex terms are composed of more than one token or word.",
        "For instance, ?lexicography?",
        "and ?multilingual terminology management?",
        "are, respectively, examples of a simple and a complex term in the domain of computational linguistics.",
        "The extracted lexical units constitute a terminological resource, also known as terminology: a specialized vocabulary of knowledge in a domain.",
        "Terms and their use are studied in a relatively young discipline, which is also called terminology (Cabr?e, 2003; Kageura, 1999): ?the field of activity concerned with the collection, description, processing and presentation of terms (Sager, 1990)?.",
        "While terminology can be approached from several perspectives, e.g. as a branch of philosophy, soci-ology, or cognitive science, terminology is dominantly considered as a linguistic and cognitive activity.",
        "1 Considering that knowledge and vocabulary are highly correlated, and vocabulary can be gained by exposure to literature.",

        "They signify concepts in a communicative context.",
        "In the figures above, the dashed lines indicate the direction in which the meaning of a term is elaborated according to these theories.",

        "Figure 2c illustrates an ambiguous term-concept relation, a polysemous relationship where a term may denote several concepts.",
        "Modern terminology is therefore pursued within a linguistic framework and as the study of specialized languages (Faber, 2012).",
        "The meanings of terms and the process of concept denomination are studied within the framework of a ?theory of terminology?.",
        "As stated in Cabr?e (2003), a theory of terminology elaborates the fundamental problem of interpretation of meaning into a set of questions in which the definition of a terminological unit -- and its characteristics -- is the nucleus.",
        "The general theory of terminology (GTT) by W?uster (1974, as cited in Campo (2013, chap.",
        "2)) is recognized as the first theory of terminology.",
        "The GTT, which is also known as traditional terminology, puts concepts first; terms are unambiguous linguistic labels that are defined independently of the context in which they are used (L?Homme, 2014) (Figure 1a).",
        "As implied by the given definition in ISO 1087-1(2000), the GTT is the most widely adopted theory amongst terminologists.",
        "3 Consequently, the GTT regards terms and concepts as having mono-referential relationships (Figure 2a).",
        "The objective behind GTT, understandably, is to eliminate ambiguity in natural language to improve clarity in technical communication.",
        "In an authoritative institutional organization that promotes or enforces standards, terms can be made and shared in a top-down manner; hence, the meaning of terms can be interpreted by the mechanism described in the GTT.",
        "4 However, in practice and in many organizations, new terms are introduced in a bottom-up synthesis process.",
        "A lexical form (which may or may not be newly invented) in contexts that bear a concept (which may or may not be newly invented) is used frequently inasmuch as it becomes a term 5 in the organization.",
        "In practice, therefore, terms can be ambiguous: a term can refer to several concepts?similar to polysemy?homonymy in lexical semantics (Figure 2c); or, contrariwise, a particular concept can be denoted by several terms (Figure 2b).",
        "Heid and Gojun (2012) suggest that the rapid evolution of organizations as well as multi-players that are involved in an uncoordinated way, specifically in multidisciplinary domains, reinforces this situation and thus term ambiguity.",
        "3 Accordingly, Felber (1982) defines terminology as ?the combined action of groups of subject specialists (terminology commissions) of specialised organisations?.",
        "4 it is, perhaps, best demonstrated in the applications of controlled natural languages.",

        "In contrast to the GTT, recent theories of terminology, e.g. the communicative theory of terminology (CTT) by Cabr?e (see 1999, chap.",
        "3), acknowledges the situation stated above and takes a bottom-up distributional approach to terminology in the sense that the meanings of terms, thus the elements of domain knowledge, are not preconceived.",
        "Terms are linguistic units that are understood differently with regards to the communicative context, e.g. by the text surrounding them, the application they are used and so on.",
        "Terms signify concepts by syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations that they hold in a specialized communicative discourse (Figure 1b).",
        "6 Methods that modern CT embraces, therefore, can be distinguished and classified by the communicative context in which they are employed.",
        "In CT, the task of automatic term recognition (ATR) is at the centre of attention.",
        "The input of ATR is a large collection of documents, i.e. a domain-specific corpus, and the output is a terminological resource.",
        "In ATR, the meaning of the generated terms is interpreted in a wide spectrum of concepts in the domain that is being investigated and represented by the input corpus.",
        "ATR facilitates the automatic construction of terminological resources; hence, it is a significant processing resource in knowledge engineering tasks and applications such as information retrieval and machine translation.",
        "As articulated by Kageura and Umino (1996), ATR deals with the computation of measures known as unithood and termhood.",
        "It is believed that the majority of terms in a domain are complex terms.",
        "Unithood indicates the degree to which a sequence of tokens can be combined to form a complex term.",
        "It is, thus, a measure of the syntagmatic relation between the constituents of complex terms: a lexical association measure to identify collocations.",
        "In the absence of explicit linguistic criteria for distinguishing complex terms from other natural language text phrases, a unithood measure construes the problem of complex term identification as the identification of stable lexical units (Sager, 1990).",
        "7 Termhood, on the other hand, -- is the degree to which a stable lexical unit is related to some domain-specific concepts?",
        "(Kageura and Umino, 1996).",
        "It characterizes a paradigmatic relation between lexical units?either simple or complex terms -- and the communicative context that verbalizes domain-concepts.",
        "Termhood, thus, envisages the measurement of meaning.",
        "In the absence of a formal answer to the question ?what domain-specific concepts are?",
        "?, devising a termhood measure for distinguishing terms and non-terms is a difficult and often conflictual task?hence, the evaluation of CT.",
        "In ATR, the communicative context is a domain-specific corpus.",
        "ATR, therefore, should not be confused with other tasks in CT?such as keyword extraction, entity recognition, etc.",
        "?that bear a close resemblance to it.",
        "These tasks are similar to ATR in the sense that they extract stable lexical units from natural language text.",
        "However, they are different from ATR, because the meaning of the extracted lexical units, thus the termhood measure, is interpreted in a context other than a domain-specific corpus (Figure 3).",
        "For example, an automatic keyphrase extraction algorithm extracts lexical units from a single document that best describe the content of this document.",
        "Both unithood and termhood must be also measured in automatic keyphrase extraction.",
        "However, the criterion for their definition and the information available for their computation are different than ATR.",
        "6 As can be understood, the main difference between the GTT and the CTT is the interpretation of the process of pairing concepts and lexical forms that is mentioned in the definition of lexical units.",

        "We can further distinguish CT methods based on the direction in which terms and text are related.",
        "Recent developments of ontological resources have stimulated a research strand that targets the reverse task of intermediary applications.",
        "The goal of these applications is to fill the gap between an available ontology, i.e. a knowledge base, and natural language text.",
        "In these tasks, given a particular concept in a knowledge base (e.g. a class and its instances in an ontology), a method?which we call term mapping following Krauthammer and Nenadic (2004)?decides if this concept or its instances has been mentioned in a given text snippet.",
        "Entity linking, which has been promoted through the series of Text Analysis Conferences, 8 is another term that characterizes these research efforts (see also Rao et al., 2013).",
        "The familiar task of named entity recognition (NER), as introduced at the Message Understanding Conference (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996), can also be placed in this category.",
        "In NER, the types of target terms are known prior to the extraction task, e.g. city, location and so on.",
        "In contrast to term mapping techniques, there are methods that organize constituent terms of a terminological resource into a variety of classes.",
        "In these methods, the usage of terms in a given domain-specific corpus is assessed to decide about their membership in concept classes.",
        "If the classes are known prior to the assignment task, then the task is known as term classification; otherwise, if the classes are not known, the task is called term clustering.",
        "As suggested by Krauthammer and Nenadic (2004), these three tasks?",
        "i.e. term recognition, term classification and term mapping?are essential for automatic construction and maintenance of terminological resources and to form a closed loop between terminology and natural language text (Figure 4).",
        "A more elaborate taxonomy of CT techniques can be obtained by distinguishing additional elements and characteristics of the communicative context, e.g. the way in which an end user benefits from the extracted terms, the role of background knowledge, linguistic characteristics of the extracted terms and so on.",
        "We leave this study for another occasion.",
        "2.1 Prevalent Mechanism in Term Extraction Tasks As suggested in Nakagawa (2001), the algorithms for term recognition are usually in the form of a two-step procedure: candidate term extraction followed by term scoring and ranking (Figure 5).",
        "Candidate term extraction deals with the term formation and the extraction of candidate terms.",
        "In a few applications, candidate term extraction can assess the morphosyntactic structure of terms, e.g. as suggested in Ananiadou (1994) and Zweigenbaum and Grabar (1999), to identify candidate terms.",
        "In these methods, existing terminologies are often available before to the extraction task and employed to identify new candidate terms.",
        "Besides this, one can identify four major methods for the extraction of candidate terms: linguistic filtering based on part of speech (PoS) tag sequences, n-gram technique, linguistic filtering based on syntactic relations and techniques that rely on the presence of particular markers in text.",
        "Methods for the extraction of candidate terms are not limited to these categories.",
        "For instance, contrastive approaches exploit a reference corpus of general language to identify simple candidate terms (Drouin, 2004, 2003); for complex terms, the comparison between corpora is followed by one of the techniques listed above.",
        "A combination of these methods can also be employed to improve 8 http://www.nist.gov/tac/about/ 56 the results (e.g. see Aubin and Hamon, 2006).",
        "Linguistic filters in the form of PoS tag sequence patterns are the most widely adopted technique for the extraction of candidate terms.",
        "In this method, any sequence of tokens with certain PoS tags are assumed as candidate terms (Justeson and Katz, 1995; Daille, 1995).",
        "Likewise, the knowledge about PoS patterns that cannot form candidate terms may be used to restrict the presence of token sequences in a list of candidate terms (Bourigault, 1992).",
        "In the n-gram technique, however, any sequences of tokens of length n, often 1 ?",
        "n ?",
        "6, that appear in the input text are considered as candidate terms.",
        "This method generates a large set of candidate terms.",
        "The number of candidate terms, therefore, is often reduced by filtering n-grams that contain tokens from a stop-word list.",
        "When linguistic processing tools are lacking, such as the case of under-resourced languages (see e.g. Pinnis et al., 2012), or the computational cost or accuracy hinders their usage, the n-gram technique is favourable.",
        "Linguistic filters that employ syntactic relations have also been used for the extraction of candidate terms.",
        "The first sub-category of these methods use shallow parsing to identify noun phrases as candidate terms (Nakagawa, 2001).",
        "The second sub-category of these methods generate candidate terms from available terminological resources to identify term variations (Jacquemin and Tzoukermann, 1999).",
        "The third subcategory, which is often employed for multilingual term extraction, exploits the head-modifier principle to identify candidate terms (Hippisley et al., 2005).",
        "Finally, a category of candidate term extraction methods takes advantage of the presence of specific markers in input text that can be used to determine boundaries of terms, e.g. the presence of mark-up metadata in Hartmann et al. (2012).",
        "Subsequent to candidate term extraction, a scoring procedure?which can be seen as a semantic weighting mechanism -- is employed to indicate how likely it is that a candidate term is a term we would like to extract.",
        "As Figure 5 suggests, the scoring procedure usually combines termhood and unithood scores.",
        "Although several categorizations of the scoring and ranking methods can be given from a methodological point of view (e.g. statistics-based, machine learning-based, rule-based, etc.)",
        "or by the kind of information that is exploited for weighting (e.g. linguistic-based, statistical-based, hybrid) as stated ear-lier, all these techniques rely on the text and take a corpus-based distributional approach to score and rank terms.",
        "The usage of candidate terms in a communicative context (e.g. domain-corpus) is formulated in a machine-tractable format, e.g. in the form of a contingency table or a vector space model.",
        "It is then assessed using statistical measures, similarity metrics, language models or a set of rules, depending on the method employed and the objective of the task in hand, which defines the type of paradigmatic relation that the termhood measure characterizes.",
        "The c-value algorithm, for instance, is an statistical method of assigning scores to candidate terms in an ATR task.",
        "It is used as a baseline in a number of ATR evaluation tasks.",
        "For each candidate term t, the c-value score of t is calculated using four criteria (Frantzi et al., 1998): the frequency of t in the corpus; the frequency of t when it appears nested in other terms longer than t; the number of those longer terms shown by T t ; and the number of the constituent words of t shown by |t|.",
        "The c-value score is given by c-value(t) = { log 2 |t|f (t) if t /?",

        "b?T t f (b)) otherwise , (1) where T t denotes the set of all the terms that contain t and are longer than t, and f(s) denotes the frequency of an arbitary term s in the corpus.",
        "Other widely applied statistical measures for termhood assements in ATR include term frequency?inverse document frequency (tf -idf ), term frequency (tf ), and inverse document frequency (idf ).",
        "We leave the study of scoring mechanisms for another occasion.",
        "3 The ACL RD-TEC: Further Annotation Layers for ACL ARC We introduce the ACL RD-TEC, a spin-off of the ACL ARC.",
        "In its first release, the ACL RD-TEC consists of manual annotations that can be used for the evaluation of ATR and term classification tasks that are explained in the previous section.",

        "and ?acknowledgements?",
        "are removed from the corpus and are organized in separate files.",
        "In addition, text cleaning is performed, e.g. broken words and text segments are joined, footnotes and captions are removed and sections are organised into paragraphs.",
        "The sectioning process is followed by the text segmentation process using the OpenNLP sentence splitter 10 and the Stanford tokenizer.",
        "The text is then annotated by the Stanford PoS tagger.",
        "11 The process is finalized by making an inverted index of the cleansed full-text documents and assigning unique identifiers to each one of the extracted linguistic units: types (i.e. PoS-tagged and lemmatized words), sentences, paragraphs and (sub)sections.",
        "All of these units are stored in separate flat tables, in which all units, except types, are presented as tuples, consisting of pairs of unique identifiers and their relative locations in the text units they constitute.",
        "Therefore, text units can be easily traced back to the publications that they appeared in.",
        "The statistics of the resulting data are given in Table 1.",
        "Afterwards, candidate terms are extracted from the processed corpus using three methods: PoS-based filtering, n-gram-based technique and noun phrase (NP) chunking.",
