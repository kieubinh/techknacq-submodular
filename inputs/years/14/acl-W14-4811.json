        "However, there is little research into the use of modern terminology extraction tools and pipelines for the task of simultaneous interpretation.",
        "At the start of computer-assisted termbank development, Moser-Mercer (1992) overviewed the needs and workflow of practicing interpreters with respect to terminology and offered some guidelines for developing term management tools specifically for the interpreters.",
        "That study did review the functionalities of some termbanks and term management systems, yet there was no mention of corpus collection (a fairly new idea at the time) or automatic term extraction.",
        "A few previous studies mentioned the application of corpora as potential electronic tools for the interpreters.",
        "Fantinuoli (2006) and Gorjanc (2009) discussed the functions of specific online crawling tools and explored ways to extract specialised terminology from disposable web corpora for interpreters.",
        "Our work is most closely connected to Fantinuoli's work on evaluation of termlists obtained from Web-derived corpora.",
        "However, that study relied on a single method of corpus collection and term extraction, and did not include an investigation into integration of corpus research into practice of interpreter training.",
        "R?tten (2003) suggested a conceptual software model for interpreters?",
        "terminology management, in which termlists are expected to be extracted (semi-)automatically and then to be revised by their users, the interpreters, who can concentrate on those terms which are relevant and important to remember.",

        "perception on the usefulness of the automatically-generated lists in their preparation for interpreting tasks.",
        "In the remainder of this paper we will describe the pipelines for corpus collection and terminology extraction (Section 2), present the results of their numeric evaluation (Section 3), and discuss options for future research, including the challenges for the term extraction pipelines in this setting (Section 4).",

        "terminology preparation with the use of term extraction tools.",
        "We compare several approaches to corpus compilation and processing for specialised texts as well as several pipelines for terminology extraction.",
        "2.1 Description of the procedure Two specialized topics In this study MA student interpreters were invited to prepare for simultaneous interpreting tasks on two specialised topics: fast reactors (FR) and Seabed minerals (SM).",
        "They were provided with two monolingual specialised corpora in both English and Chinese for their advance preparation on each of the topics (FR & SM).",
        "Three term extractors The students started with the FR topic, and were asked to manually generate their own lists from the provided corpora (FR1 En & Zh) before their simultaneous interpreting exercise on the topic in both directions (English?Chinese and Chinese?English).",
        "After their interpreting tasks, they were then asked to evaluate the relevance of two monolingual lists (En & Zh) which were automatically generated by one of the three tools (TTC TermSuite, Syllabs Tools and TeaBoat).",
        "The purpose here is to see which tool could extract more relevant terms for the needs of trainee interpreters.",
        "We collected and compared the annotation results from the students to select a single tool with comparatively better performance.",
        "We then invited the students to prepare for the other topic (SM) by using automatically-generated lists in the simultaneous interpreting preparation.",
        "2.2 Corpus compilation There are two types of sources where comparable corpora are from: 1.",
        "Conference documents and relevant background documents provided by the conference organisers 2.",
        "Specialised corpora collected from the internet using WebBootCat (Baroni and Bernardini, 2004) Table 1 presents all the corpora we use in this study.",
        "FR0/SM0 has been created from a single relevant document, representing the speech that the trainee interpreters were asked to interpret from in this experiment.",
        "We also ran term extraction from this ?corpus?",
        "since often a text of this length is the only source of information given to the interpreters in advance.",
        "We tried to balance the terminological difficulty for both languages, even if this was not always possible.",
        "After manual term selection, we found that FR0-Zh contains 147 terms per 591 seconds of delivery (15 terms per minute), FR0-En: 86 terms per 566 seconds (9 t/min), SM0-Zh: 157 terms per 604 seconds (16 t/min), SM0-En: 169 terms per 750 seconds (14/min).",
        "1 1 Counting the term density per unit of text is not straightforward, because of very different tokenisation rules in Chinese and English.",
        "87 Seeds (En) Seeds (Zh) fast breeder reactor ????????",
        "fission ??",
        "decay heat ??",

        "coolant ???",
        "Table 2: Parallel keyword seeds on Fast Reactors for FR2 FR1 (En & Zh) and SM1 (En & Zh) are comparable corpora, which represent conference documents and relevant background documents passed from the conference organisers, including speech outlines, research papers from experts and research institutes, reports from national and international authorities, as well as popular science articles, Wikipedia articles, specialised journal articles and interviews, etc.",
        "FR2 (En & Zh) and SM2 (En & Zh) are corpora collected by Web crawling using Bootcat(Baroni and Bernardini, 2004).",
        "For instance, to produce FR2 we started with a set of ten relevant keywords in English and Chinese as shown in Table 2, then used BootCat to retrieve online resources and generate two corpora (FR2 En & Zh).",
        "All the keyword seeds are from the English speech-FR0 that the students were going to interpret from, and are therefore considered very relevant and important terms.",
        "The Chinese keywords are the translations of the English ones.",
        "Preprocessing included webpage cleaning (Baroni et al., 2008), as well as basic linguistic processing.",
        "Lemmatisation and tagging for English was done using TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994), while for Chinese we used ?Segmenter?, an automatic tokenisation tool (Liang et al., 2010) followed by TreeTagger for POS tagging.",
        "Lemmatisation is needed because the keywords in a glossary are expected to be in their dictionary form.",
        "Lemmatisation also helps in reducing the nearly identical forms, e.g., sulphide deposit(s).",
        "However, lemmatisation also leads to imperfect terms, e.g., recognise type of marine resource, while the plurals and participles should be expected in a dictionary form (recognised type of marine resources).",
        "2.3 Automatic term extraction TTC TermSuite (Daille, 2012) is based on lexical patterns defined in terms of Part-of-Speech (POS) tags with frequency comparison against a reference corpus using specificity index (Ahmad et al., 1994), which extracts both single (SWT) and multi-word terms (MWT) outputs their lemmas, part of speech, lexical pattern, term variants (if any), etc.",
        "The most important feature of the TTC TermSuite is the fact that term candidates can be output with their corresponding term variants.",
        "Syllabs Tools (Blancafort et al., 2013) is a knowledge-poor tool, which is based on unsupervised detection of POS tags, following the procedure of (Clark, 2003), and on the Conditional Random Field framework for term extraction (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "Teaboat (Sharoff, 2012) does term extraction by detecting noun phrases using simple POS patterns in IMS Corpus Workbench (Christ, 1994) and by applying log-likelihood statistics (Rayson and Garside, 2000) to rank terms by their relevance to the corpus in question against the Internet reference corpora for English and Chinese (Sharoff, 2006).",
        "3 Term extraction evaluation Fantinuoli (2006) used five categories to find the level of specialisation and well-formedness of the automatically-generated candidate termlist: 1. specialised terms that were manually extracted by the terminologist (and are contained in the reference term list); 88 FR-TTC FR-Teaboat FR-Syllabs SM-Syllabs EN ZH EN ZH EN ZH EN ZH 0.541 0.500 0.166 0.435 0.181 0.662 0.117 0.221 Table 3: Krippendorff's ?",
        "for different term lists 2. highly specialised terms that were not detected by the terminologist; 3. non-specialised terms that are commonly used in the field of his study (medicine); 4. general terms that are not specific to the medical field; 5. ill-formed, incomplete expressions and fragments.",
        "Our annotation system extends Fantinuoli's study because the purpose of annotation in this project is to give the interpreters possibility to extract relevant terms from all the candidate terms regardless of their levels of specialisation.",
        "Our premise is that interpreters may need relevant terms, both highly specialised and less specialised, in order to prepare themselves for a conference.",
        "The annotators are the end users of the list, i.e. the trainee interpreters who participated in this research.",
        "Since the interpreters are tasked with translating speeches in the domain, they need themselves to decide what is likely to be relevant instead of relying on the terminologists who describe the overall structure of the domain.",
        "The following is the five-category annotation system that we used in this research: R relevant terms (terms closely relevant to the topic), eg.",
        "breed ratio, uranium-238, decay heat removal system; P potentially relevant terms (a category between ?I?",
        "and ?R?",
        ": they are terms; but annotators are not sure whether they are closely relevant to the topic of their assignment), eg.",
        "daughter nuclide, neutron poison, Western reactor; I irrelevant terms (terms not relevant to the topic), eg.",
        "schematic diagram, milk crate; G general words (rather than terms), eg.",
        "technical option, monthly donation, Google tag, discussion forum; IL ill-formed constructions (parts of terms or chunks of words), eg.",
        "var, loss of cooling, separate sample container, first baseline data, control ranging.",
        "It only took several minutes to generate a termlist after uploading the designated corpus onto TTC TermSuite, Syllabs Tools and TeaBoat.",
        "Each of them automatically generated corresponding monolingual termlists sorted by their term specificity scores.",
        "For all the tools we set the threshold of obtaining 500 terms (if possible), as a practical limit for all evaluation experiments.",
        "The trainee interpreters were asked to annotate the list by using the above annotation system.",
        "Each of them reported that it took them about 60 minutes to annotate both lists (in EN& ZH) on each of the topics (FR & SM).",
        "All the annotators were briefed about what counts as terms and the annotation system before they started their evaluation of term lists.",
        "We aim for consistency, yet inter-annotator disagreement does exist and there is a certain degree of subjectivity in annotation.",
        "To measure the level of agreement we used Krippendorff's ?",
        "over the other measures, such as Fleiss?",
        "?, because Krippendorff's ?",
        "offers an extension of such measures as Fleiss?",
        "?",
        "and Scott's pi by introducing a distance metric for the pairwise disagreements, thus making it possible to work with interval-scale ratings, e.g., considering disagreement between R and P as less severe than between R and I (Krippendorff, 2004).",
        "The values of Krippendorff's ?",
        "(see Table 3) are relatively low.",
        "The most common cases of disagreement are between R and P (the boundary between them often depends on the amount of knowledge on the side of the annotator), but also quite surprisingly between R and IL, when some annotators interpret ill-formed sequences as a contribution to useful terms.",
        "With the disagreement taken into consideration, our evaluation on the number of relevant terms was judged by the agreement between at least two annotators among four to six annotators for the topic of FR.",
        "This established the gold standard lists reported in Table 4.",
        "The annotation results from Table 4 for English show that Syllabs generated more relevant terms than the other two tools from both FR0 and FR1.",
        "Both Syllabs and Teaboat generated good numbers of 89 English: Tool FR0 FR1 FR2 SM1 Syllabs 85/104(82%) 309/500 (62%) 400/500 (80%) 441/500 (88%) Teaboat 44/56(79%) 232/376 (62%) 413/499 (83%) TTC NA 136/500 (27%) 287/500 (57%) Chinese: Tool FR1 SM1 Syllabs 156/500(31%) 130/500 (26%) Teaboat 141/450(31%) TTC 119/500(24%) Table 4: Number of relevant (R) terms against candidate terms relevant terms from FR2.",
        "In addition, Syllabs?",
        "and TeaBoat's English lists contain more specialised terms in the domain of FR, such as defence-in-depth, once-through fuel cycle, suppression chamber of the containment, etc.",
        "These specialised terms with relatively low frequency are not included in the TTC's list.",
        "The terms included in TTC's list are more general terms, such as steam, energy, liquid, heat, leak, etc., which are likely to be already known by the trainee interpreters.",
        "The English termlists from all the tools contain a number of repetitions in the form of term variants, following Daille's definition as ?an utterance which is semantically and conceptually related to an original term?",
        "(Daille, 2005).",
        "The automatically generated termlists contain the following types of term variations, which are counted as individual term candidates scattered in the termlists: Morphological variation: bathymetry vs bathymetric (not different when translated into Chinese) Anaphoric variation: pollymetallic sulphide deposit vs deposit Pattern switching: meltdown of the core vs core meltdown; level of gamma radiation vs gamma radiation level Synonymy in variation: deep sea mining vs deep seabed mining, seabed vs seafloor, ferromanganese crust vs iron-manganese crust One the one hand, these variations provide useful lexical information about the term, preparing the interpreters for what is possible in their assignment; on the other hand, the term variants need to be explicitly linked, which is possible only in the TTC TermSuite tool.",
        "The annotation results from Table 4 for Chinese show, both Syllabs?",
        "and Teaboat's lists offer obviously less relevant terms from FR1 compared with the English lists.",
        "When we further investigate the distribution of the term classes in annotations in Table 5, Syllabs?",
        "Chinese list on FR1 contains a large number of ill-formed constructions, including incomplete terms, eg.",
        "??",
        "?water reactor?, ????",

        "?development?,??",
        "?production?",
        "or??",
        "?project?.",
        "Both categories (G and IL) are frequent in the TTC's Chinese list.",
        "On the basis of these results, we selected a single tool (Syllabs) with comparatively better performance in both languages to generate termlists on SM1 (En & Zh) and asked 12 annotators to select the relevant terms and learn the terms during their interpreting preparation.",
        "Among the 500 candidate terms for English, 441 terms were agreed as relevant by at least two annotators, 266 terms were agreed by five annotators.",
        "Precision rates are 88.2% and 53.2% respectively.",
        "On the other hand, only 130 terms were agreed as relevant by two annotators from the 500 Chinese candidate terms.",
        "The precision rate for the Chinese list is 26%.",
        "The results basically replicate the previous findings on FR1.",
        "The other pattern we observe from the current data is that the larger the corpus is, the more relevant terms the tools can generate.",
        "If the corpus is of very limited size (eg.",
        "FR0-en has only 774 words), the TTC TermSuite fails to generate any list for a ?corpus?",
        "of only 774 words, while the Syllabs and Teaboat tools produce shorter lists of 104 or 56 terms respectively.",
        "The situation is similar to other studies which used small (single-document) corpora, e.g., (Matsuo and Ishizuka, 2004).",

        "Among the three term extractors (TTC TermSuite, Syllabs Tools and Teaboat), Syllabs is more reliable in generating more relevant terms in English.",
        "All the three tools perform less satisfactory in generating relevant terms in Chinese.",

        ".",
        "Further investigation might be helpful in finding out how the pre-processing steps affect the performance of the term extractors and which terms are affected by each source of errors.",
        "Manual selection Vs Automatic extraction of terms For the interpreters, manually selecting terms from a single document of limited size (eg.",
        "FR0-en=774 words) is possible.",
        "However, when conference documents amount to the size of FR1 (FR1-en=42,006 words), it took the trainee interpreters 9 hours on average to extract terms manually and to produce initial termlists, since they had to spend the majority of their time on reading through fairly complex documents, copying the terms from the texts onto their own termlists and searching for unfamiliar terms.",
        "91 With the use of automatically-generated termlists on the same preparation task, students in the experiment group spent an average of 4 hours producing their initial bilingual termlists.",
        "Therefore half of the time spent on reading could be saved for the interpreters to get familiar with the concepts relevant to the terms and further activate the terms for their simultaneous interpreting tasks.",
        "Furthermore, if interpreters are given limited time for preparation, they would not be able to read through larger corpora of the size of FR2 (FR2-en=206,197 words) and to produce termlists from them manually.",
        "That is probably when such tools we discussed in this article may have obvious advantage over the manual terms extraction by the interpreters.",
        "Moreover, in other studies we also demonstrated that in addition to providing an automatically-extracted termlist, it is also beneficial to link the terms to their uses in the concordance lines of the corpus they have been extracted from.",
        "This is expected to give the interpreters an easy access to the context of the terms to see how they are used and get more background knowledge about the domain.",

        "(even taking into account the 24% to 31% precision rate for Chinese).",

        "On the other hand, students reported that the termlists in Chinese offered much less relevant terms and contained quite a number of ill-formed constructions compared with the lists in English; therefore they felt the lists in Chinese were less useful and less reliable.",
        "Extraction of proper names Proper names (including names of organisations, names of places, names and titles of people) are equally if not more important than terms for interpreters, yet many of them are not included in the automatically-generated lists by the three term extractors (TTC, Syllabs and Teaboat).",
