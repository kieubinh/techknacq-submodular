        "The exact definition of a multiword expression (MWE) is a challenging task and it varies from author to author.",
        "For example, Moon (1998) says: ??",
        "there is no unified phenomenon to describe but rather a complex of features that interact in various, often untidy, ways and represent a broad continuum between non-compositional (or idiomatic) and compositional groups of words.?",
        "Moreover, this phenomenon receives different names in the literature (Proost, 2005): phraseological units, fixed expressions, word combinations, phrasemes, etc.",
        "In this study, we consider MWE in a similar way Mel'?uk (1998) defines a phraseme: a phrase which is not free, i.e. the expression's signifier and/or signified are not unrestrictedly and regularly constructed.",
        "A phrase P is unrestrictedly constructed when the rules applied to construct P are not mandatory.",
        "For example, instead of the phrase: ?doing a research?",
        "it is possible to say ?performing a research?, ?executing a research?",
        "i.e., this expression is not fixed.",
        "However, in a sign like ?No smoking?, it is not common to see variants like ?Smoking prohibited?",
        "or ?Do not smoke?, although those are grammatically correct variants which express the same meaning.",
        "Then, ?No smoking?",
        "is a phraseme (MWE), because it is not unrestrictedly constructed.",
        "A phrase P is regularly constructed when the words forming it are combined following the general rules of the grammar and its sense can be derived exclusively from the sense of its constituent words.",
        "The phrase: ?he died yesterday?, is regularly constructed because it follows the rules of the grammar and its sense follows from the sense the words forming it.",
        "However, the expression ?kicked the bucket?",
        "is not regularly constructed, in relation to its meaning (the combination of words follows the rules of the grammar), because its sense, ?died?, cannot be derived from the sense of its constituent ______________ This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "104 words.",
        "On the other hand, the expression ?passing by?",
        "is not regularly constructed because it does not follow the general rules of the grammar.",
        "According to Mel?",
        "?uk (1998), it is possible to divide the phrasemes (MWEs) in two groups: pragmatemes and semantic phrasemes.",
        "As pragmatemes, we can have: Expressions in which both the signified and the signifier are not unrestrictedly constructed (although they are regularly constructed), e.g. ?all you can eat?, or Expressions in which only the signified is not unrestrictedly constructed.",
        "For example, in a library it is possible to have signs like ?Please be quiet?, ?No talking please?, etc.",
        "In this case, the signifier (the form, the words forming the expression) is more or less free; however, the sense is always the same.",
        "In semantic phrasemes, the signified is free (it is constructed unrestrictedly; however, it is not constructed regularly) and the signifier is not free.",
        "We can have three types of semantic phrasemes: - Idioms: the sense of the expression goes beyond the sense of its constituent words, and does not include their senses.",
        "Examples: ?of course?, ?",
        "(to) pull (someone?s) leg?, ?",
        "(to) spill the beans?",
        "; - Collocations: the sense of the expression includes the sense of one of its constituent words, say, w1.",
        "The other word is freely chosen and w1 is chosen contingent to it.",
        "Collocations can be (Manning and Schütze, 1999): light verbs constructions (e.g. make a call, take a decision), verb particle constructions (e.g. to switch on, to pass by), proper names (e.g. San Francisco, Bill Gates) and terminological expressions, i.e., multiword terms (e.g. gross domestic product, light year).",
        "- Quasi-phrasemes or quasi-idioms: the signified of the expression contains the signified of its constituent words; however, it also contains a signified that goes beyond the signified of the isolated words (e.g. (to) start a family, bed and breakfast).",
        "For a more complete explanation about pragmatemes and semantic phrasemes, refer to (Mel?",
        "?uk, 1998) or to (Morgan, 1978).",
        "For a more detailed linguistic description on the properties of MWEs, see (Baldwin and Kim, 2010).",
        "In this paper, we assume as MWE any kind of phraseme.",
        "However, we are interested in the study of Portuguese two-word expressions formed mostly by nouns, adjectives and verbs.",
        "For this reason, since most of pragmatemes and idioms are formed by more than two words, basically our focus is on quasi-phrasemes and collocations (mostly light verbs constructions, proper names and multiword terms (MWT)).",
        "The literature on MWE extraction describes different methods for the identification or extraction of MWEs.",
        "Many of them rely on association measures, such as Dice's coefficient (Smadja, 1996) or mutual information (Church and Hanks, 1990).",
        "A complete explanation on the use of this association measures on the task of extraction MWEs from text can be found in (Manning and Schütze, 1999).",
        "The main idea behind such measures is that the higher the association among the words that appear together in a text, the higher the probability that they constitute a single semantic unit.",
        "There are other methods, which use linguistic information or hybrid approaches that combine statistical measures with the linguistic information, such as the grammatical class of each word, the sense of the expression or the syntactic regularities.",
        "Yet others are based on classification algorithms, popular in machine learning systems.",
        "In this study we performed two types of comparison.",
        "In the first one, we compared the performance of nine different classification algorithms in the task of identifying MWEs.",
        "In the second, we compared two different tools, Text-NSP and Termostat, using different association measures, in the task of extracting MWEs from text.",
        "Although our focus is in general MWE, the current study could also be applied to corpus in a specific area for the extraction of multiword terms (MWT).",
        "2 Related Work Baptista (1994) presents a linguistic study about the nominal expressions formed by more than two words in Portuguese.",
        "From a set of 10,000 expressions, he created a typology of nominal MWEs.",
        "He found that 70% of the nominal MWEs follow only five different patterns (A = adjective, N = noun, V = verb and P = preposition): A-N, N-A, N-P-N, N-N and V-N.",
        "He analyses the syntactic proprieties of each of these groups, focusing his attention on the patterns N-A and N-P-N, which he considers less 105 rigid and more difficult to treat automatically.",
        "Finally, he integrates the MWEs?",
        "morphological information to an electronic dictionary.",
        "Antunes and Mendes (2013) propose the creation of a MWE typology that includes its semantic, syntactic and pragmatic properties, aiming the annotation of a MWE lexicon using this typology information.",
        "They divide the MWEs in three groups, from a semantic standpoint: expressions with compositional meaning, e.g. ?banana bread?, expression with partial idiomatic meaning, e.g. ?vontade de ferro?",
        "(iron will) and expressions with total idiomatical meaning (or with no compositionality), e.g. ?spill the beans?.",
        "Within each of these three groups, the expressions are subdivided according to their grammatical categories and lexical and syntactical fixedness.",
        "After a survey and a comparison on different association measures, algorithms and tools used on the identification of MWEs, Portela (2011) presents a study on the identification of Portuguese MWEs following two patterns, N-A and N-P-N, using different association measures.",
        "After the extraction of candidates, syntactic criteria are applied to them, to verify their fixedness and determine if a candidate is a MWE.",
        "Examples of syntactic criteria applied to bigrams following the pattern N-A and N-P-N: Loss of adjective's predicative characteristic: when the adjective comes after the noun and it can be paraphrased by a copulative verb (e.g. verb ?to be?)",
        "+ the same adjective, keeping the same sense, the adjective has a predicative function.",
        "For example, in the expression: ?homem cansado?",
        "(tired man, lit.",
        "man tired), it is possible to substitute ?cansado?",
        "for ?que estava cansado?",
        "(that was tired), and the adjective's predicative characteristic is maintained.",
        "However, in the expression ?sorriso amarelo?",
        "(false, not natural smile, lit.",
        "smile yellow), if we substitute the expression for ?sorriso que ?",
        "amarelo?, (smile that is yellow), the predicative characteristic is not maintained, because the original sense is lost.",
        "This loss of predicative characteristic shows that the expression is fixed, and it is evidence that the expression is a MWE.",
        "Insertion of elements in the expression (N-P-N): consider the expression ?livro de bolso?",
        "(pocket book, lit.",
        "book of pocket).",
        "It is not possible to freely insert a modifier, for example ?",
        "*livro do Paulo de bolso?",
        "(lit.",
        "book of Paulo of Pocket).",
        "In this example, the modifier can be inserted only at the end of the expression: ?livro de bolso do Paulo?.",
        "This kind of fixedness is evidence that the expression is a MWE.",
        "3 Methodology We restricted the present study on the extraction of two-word MWEs.",
        "For their data, for example, Piao et al. (2003) found that 81.88% of the recognized MWEs were bigrams.",
        "The current study uses CETENFolha (Corpus de Extractos de Textos Electr?nicos/NILC Folha de S?o Paulo) as a Brazilian Portuguese corpus, available on the Linguateca Portuguesa website, which is part of a project on the automatic processing of the Portuguese language (Kinoshita et al., 2006).",
        "CETENFolha is composed by excerpts from the Brazilian newspaper \"Folha de S?o Paulo\", and contains over 24 million words.",
        "At the current stage, we use a small fraction of the corpus, comprising 3,409 excerpts of text (about 250,000 words).",
        "Each excerpt corresponds to individual news covering different areas.",
        "The number 3,409 represents 1% of the number of excerpts composing the corpus.",
        "We performed different types of evaluation.",
        "First, we generated a reference file containing the most frequent MWEs in the corpus and we compared nine different classification algorithms against this reference in the task of identifying Portuguese MWEs.",
        "Second, we tested a multilayer perceptron using three different training functions in the task of classifying MWEs in different patterns.",
        "We also extracted automatically the 2,000 most frequent bigrams from the entire corpus and we identified, by hand, which ones are MWEs, and we classified them in patterns.",
        "Finally, we used two different tools for the identification of MWEs: Text-NSP (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003) and Termostat (Drouin, 2003).",
        "For these tools, we are interested in two types of evaluation.",
        "In the first evaluation, we used our reference list to automatically compare the best candidates obtained by each tool against this reference.",
        "In the second evaluation, we manually counted the number of MWEs, among a list of the 500-best candidates ranked by one of the association measures, log-likelihood, and we calculated the precision for each tool.",
        "106 3.1 Reference File Creation Before the indexation, some pre-processing methods on the corpus were performed, such as lemmatization and elimination of stop words (articles, prepositions, conjunctions).",
        "In this study, we are mostly interested in analyzing MWEs formed by nouns, adjectives and verbs.",
        "And since those stop words are very common in Portuguese, their elimination reduces considerably the number of MWE candidates that would not be relevant to this study.",
        "In this case, some common Portuguese MWEs are not considered, especially the ones following the pattern noun-preposition-noun, e.g. ?teia de aranha?",
        "(cobweb), or the pattern preposition-noun, e.g.",
        "?",
        "'s vezes?",
        "(sometimes).",
        "We obtained 49,589 bigrams and we established a frequency of 3 as a threshold.",
        "We selected 1,170 bigrams that appeared more than 3 times in our corpus?",
        "excerpts as our MWE candidates, and by hand we recognized 447 of them as Portuguese MWEs, and we considered those 447 MWEs as our reference file.",
        "It is important to note that our reference file does not contain all the two-word MWEs in the corpus?",
        "excerpt, since we generated more than 49,000 bigrams, and we could not evaluate all of them by hand.",
        "Furthermore, the corpus is formed by newspaper texts, treating different subjects, thus it is more difficult to create a closed set of all possible two-word MWEs.",
        "Therefore, our evaluation in the present study is based on a comparison of how many of the most frequent two-word MWEs in our corpus are ranked as n-best candidates by some of the association measures implemented by each tool.",
        "3.2 Comparison of Different Classification Algorithms First, we computed the frequency of each of those 1,170 bigrams and the frequency of its constituent words.",
        "Then, we classified by hand each of the words according to their grammatical class: 1 for nouns, 2 for adjectives, 3 for verbs, 4 for other classes (adverbs, pronouns and numbers) and 5 for proper names.",
        "We decided not to use a POS-tagger to guarantee the correct grammatical class assignment to each word.",
        "This gave us 25 patterns of bigrams: N-N (noun-noun), N-A (noun- adjective), N-V (noun-verb), V-N, PN-PN (proper name-proper name), etc.",
        "Second, we created a matrix of 1,170 lines and five columns.",
        "For each line, the first column represents the frequency of a bigram in the excerpt of text, the second column represents the frequency of the first bigram's word, the third column represents the frequency of the second bigram's word, the fourth column represents the grammatical class of the first bigram's word and the fifth column represents the grammatical class of the second bigram's word.",
        "This matrix was used to evaluate the precision and recall of nine different classification algorithms: decision tree, random forest, ada boost (using decision stamp as classifier), bagging (using fast decision tree learner as classifier), KNN (K nearest neighbors), SVM, multilayer perceptron, naive Bayesian net and Bayesian net.",
        "3.3 Bigrams Pattern Classification We chose one of the algorithms with the best performance (multi-layer perceptron) and we evaluated it using three different training functions, Bayesian regulation back propagation (br), Levenberg-Marquardt (lm) and scaled conjugate gradient (scg), and we compared their performance in the classification of different patterns of bigrams as MWE.",
        "The data used for the classification is formatted in the same way as in the Subsection 3.2.",
        "However, for this comparison, we used only the patterns that gave 10 or more samples of MWE, for example, the patterns: N-A, N-N and N-PN.",
        "3.4 The Text-NSP Tool Text-NSP is a tool used in the task of MWE extraction from texts (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003).",
        "In order to use Text-NSP tool, we do not provide a file containing the POS patterns of the bigrams that we would like to extract as MWE candidates.",
        "Therefore, before applying this tool, the only preprocessing task we performed with the source corpus, was removing the XML tags they contained.",
        "The next step was to define a stop words list file, since we were interested in finding MWEs following the bigram's patterns formed only by nouns, adjectives, verbs and others classes (adverbs, pronouns and numbers), e.g. N-N, N-A, N-V, O-N. We ran the program using the ?count.pl?",
        "script, giving the stop words file and the corpus files as parameters, and 2 as n-gram value, which refers to our aim to generate only bigrams.",
        "107 The output file is a list of all bigrams in the corpus, and each line contains a bigram, the frequency of the bigram, and the frequency of each of the two words forming the bigram.",
        "Using the output file and the ?statistics.pl?",
        "script, we generated the candidates?",
        "files ranked by four different association measures: Dice's coefficient (dice), log-likelihood (ll), pointwise mutual information (pmi) and Student's t-test (t).",
        "Then we transformed each of the candidate files to the XML format used by MWEtoolkit (Ramisch, 2012) and used MWEtoolkit's scripts to create files with the n-best candidates (n = 50, 100, 500, 1000 and 3000) and compare each candidate file against the reference file.",
        "3.5 The Termostat Tool Termostat (Drouin, 2003) is a tool developed for an automatic extraction of terms.",
        "It can be currently used with five different languages: English, French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish.",
        "It generates statistics for simple and complex expressions.",
        "Since in this study we are interested in MWE, we extracted only the complex expressions.",
        "As for Text-NSP, Termostat requires the elimination of the XML tags the corpus contained; which was the only pre-processing step of the corpus.",
        "After the analysis of the corpus, the system generated the lists of expressions ranked by four association measures: log-likelihood (ll), chi-squared (?2), log-odds ratio (lor) and the ?sp?cificit??",
        "measure (Lafon, 1980) (sp).",
        "Then we proceeded as for Text-NSP: we created files with the n-best candidates, ranked by the four association measures and compared each candidate file against the reference file.",
        "3.6 Comparison between the 500-best Candidates of each Tool Using the association measure that is implemented by both tools, the log-likelihood, we analyzed the 500-best candidates ranked by this association measure using each tool.",
        "We selected by hand the MWEs among those candidates and we calculated the precision of each tool, for the n-best first candidates (n = 50, 100, 150?500).",
        "4 Evaluations 4.1 Comparison of Different Classification Algorithms First, we had to proceed to an indirect estimative of the recall.",
        "We found 49,589 bigrams in the selected excerpts of texts, and the manual evaluation of each one, in order to decide which one is a MWE, would take too much time.",
        "So, we estimated the amount of MWEs for the total 49,589 bigrams as in (Piao et al., 2003).",
        "Using 100 excerpts of text we generated all the bigrams, with all frequencies.",
        "We obtained 1,715 bigrams.",
        "Then, we found by hand 136 MWEs, which tells us that about 7.93% of the bigrams are MWEs.",
        "Considering that the corpus is homogeneous, we can extrapolate and say that about 7.93% of the 49,589 bigrams in our total excerpts are MWEs, which gives 3,932 MWEs.",
        "Since we found 447 MWEs after applying the filter of frequency (> 3), our base recall is 11.37% (447/3,932).",
        "We used this base recall as a multiplying factor for the recall given by each classification algorithm.",
        "We used our generated data to test nine different classification algorithms: decision tree, random forest, ada boost, bagging, KNN (K nearest neighbors), SVM, multilayer perceptron, naive Bayesian net and Bayesian net.",
        "The main parameters used with each algorithm are listed below.",

        "The results are summarized in Table 1, where Recall-1 is the recall given by each algorithm based on the 447 MWEs found among the MWE candidates and Recall-2 is Recall-1 multiplied by 0.1137 (base recall, as previously calculated), which gives an estimative of the recall for the entire corpus.",
        "As we see in Table 1, the values of precision are very similar for all the algorithms, varying between 0.830 (random forest) and 0.857 (bagging), with the exception of SVM, which gave a precision of 0.738.",

        "We observe that we obtained good precision and weak recall.",
        "This is due, as observed by Piao et al. (2003), to the fact that the extraction of the MWE candidates is based only on the frequency of the bigrams, and only after the extraction of these candidates we applied the linguistic information (classification in grammatical classes).",
        "However, we must consider that, although we extracted only about 11% of the MWEs, these 11% are the most frequent and they represent about 46% of all the MWEs in the corpus, if we sum up the frequency of each MWE.",
