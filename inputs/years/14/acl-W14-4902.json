        "The aim of the paper is to introduce possibilities of interplay between two linguistic phenomena -- discourse and coreference relations -- annotated in the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT).",

        "In other words, the paper tries to show how we can build on existing annotation of coreference to improve another level of annotation ?",
        "discourse.",
        "1.1 Annotation of Discourse Relations in the Prague Dependency Treebank The Prague Dependency Treebank is a corpus of almost 50 thousand sentences of Czech journalistic texts that offers linguistic data manually annotated on three layers -- it interlinks morphological, syntactic and complex semantic (or tectogrammatic) annotation (Haji? et al., 2006, Bej?ek et al., 2012).",
        "For the semantic layer of PDT, there also exists annotation of coreference (Nedoluzhko et al., 2011), and discourse (as the only annotated corpus of Czech; see Pol?kov? et al., 2012a).",
        "Discourse relations are marked between two verbal arguments (i.e. two relevant parts of text) if they are signalled by a certain discourse marker -- see an example from PDT: (1) The mattress was terrible, no quality at first sight.",
        "However, he did not care.",
        "(In original: [Matrace] byla na prvn?",
        "pohled stra?n?, nekvalitn?.",
        "On na to ale v?bec nedbal.)",
        "1 In this paper, we understand discourse in narrow sense, i.e. as text relations between sentences (verbal arguments).",
        "Coreference is here used as an umbrella term for grammatical and textual coreference and bridging relations expressed in section 4.",
        "Although bridging relations differ from coreference in traditional sense, as they express an indirect relation based on association, we use the general term coreference in the text for better transparency.",
        "added by the organizers.",
        "pohled stra?n?, nekvalitn?)",
        "and the second he did not care (on na to ale v?bec nedbal).",
        "Between these two arguments, there is a discourse relation of opposition signalled by the conjunction however (ale).",
        "Therefore, in this case, however (ale) has a function of discourse marker.",
        "In the first phase of discourse annotation (see the Prague Discourse Treebank 1.0, Pol?kov?",
        "et al., 2012a), only discourse relations (between verbal arguments) introduced by explicit connectives have been captured.",
        "Explicit connectives are understood as closed class expressions with connecting function at the level of discourse description (see Pol?kov?",

        "potom, pak) and particles (mainly rhematizers as too, only ?",
        "tak?, jen).",
        "However, during annotation, there occurred also other expressions exactly with the same connecting function that differed from connectives in both lexical and syntactic aspect.",
        "These expressions were called alternative lexicalizations of discourse connectives (shortly AltLexes) in the Penn Discourse Treebank2 (see Prasad et al., 2010); their examples are this is the reason why (to je d?vod, pro?",

        "In some cases, explicit discourse connectives and their alternative lexicalizations are even interchangeable ?",

        "signalling a discourse relation of reason and result.",
        "This AltLex is replaceable by the connective therefore and the meaning remains exactly the same.",
        "The example demonstrates that a complete discourse annotation should contain also relations expressed by AltLexes.",
        "Therefore, a detailed research on AltLexes is useful and needed.",
        "In this respect, the present paper tries to demonstrate how the new instances of Czech AltLexes may be automatically found in the Prague Dependency Treebank on the basis of the already finished coreference annotation.",
        "2 Alternative Lexicalizations of Discourse Connectives in PDT Alternative lexicalizations of discourse connectives were firstly described in detail for English (see Prasad et al., 2010).",
        "English AltLexes were examined from the lexico-syntactic and semantic point of view.",
        "Similar analysis has been made also for Czech (see Rysov?, 2012a) ?",
        "the research was carried out on the basis of the annotated data from PDT.",
        "In the first stage of discourse annotation in PDT (i.e. annotation of Czech data), the annotators (trained students of linguistics) were asked to fill a comment ?AltLex?",
        "to such expressions that function in the text, according to their interpretation, as Czech AltLexes.",
        "The aim of the first stage (regarding the AltLexes) was to collect an adequate sample of material that allowed the preliminary analysis of Czech AltLexes (see Rysov?, 2012a).",
        "Altogether, PDT contains 49,431 sentences with the annotation of discourse.",
        "Within them, there were 306 expressions (or tokens) with the annotators?",
        "comment ?AltLex?.",
        "This number seems to be rather low.",
        "However, the annotators did not mark all instances of AltLexes ?",
        "in the first stage, the aim was not a final and complete annotation (as Czech AltLexes are a new and uninvestigated topic) but a collection of material for further research.",
        "So for example, we found out that the Czech AltLex because of (d?ky) appears in PDT in 14 instances although firstly, it was marked in the annotators?",
        "comment just in one case.",
        "2 The terms AltLex's and explicit discourse connectives are used in the Prague Dependency Treebank and Penn Discourse Treebank not fully identically.",
        "For example, Penn Discourse Treebank captures prepositional phrases as connectives whereas Prague Dependency Treebank as AltLex's etc.",
        "However, both understand connectives as closed class expressions and AltLex's as open class expressions with connecting function at the level of discourse.",
        "12 Therefore, it is obvious that the preliminary number 306 of Czech AltLexes will considerably grow and that in the following stage of annotation, it is necessary to search for Czech AltLexes more systematically.",
        "3 A Specific Group of Czech AltLexes: Preposition + an Anaphoric Expression On the basis of the 306 tokens gained from the first stage of annotation, there was created a preparatory list of Czech AltLexes (see Rysov?, 2012b).",
        "It appeared that one significant group of them is formed by Czech prepositions followed by an anaphoric expression referring to the previous argument.",
        "These are expressions like because of this (kv?li tomu), due to this fact (d?ky t?to skute?nosti), despite this situation (navzdory t?to situaci) etc.",
        "?",
        "see an example from PDT: (3) President Fernando Collor probably hoarded millions to his own pocket.",
        "Because of this, he is supposed to fail.",
        "(In original: Prezident Fernando Collor si ?dajn?",
        "nahrabal do vlastn?",
        "kapsy mili?ny.",
        "Kv?li tomu pravd?podobn?",
        "padne.)",
        "In the example, there is a discourse relation of reason and result introduced by the AltLex because of this (kv?li tomu) that is replaceable by the connective therefore (proto) in this case.",
        "In this group of AltLexes, it is the preposition that carries the core of lexical meaning as well as the property of being an AltLex (see Rysov?, 2012b).",
        "It means that the preposition carries the information about the type of the discourse relation ?",
        "e.g. the example (3) demonstrates that it is the expression because of (kv?li) that signals a relation of reason and result and therefore the preposition is also the fixed part of the AltLex.",
        "At the same time, the preposition obligatorily combines with an anaphoric reference that may vary ?",
        "in the example (3), it is the pronoun this (tomu) but it is variable with other anaphoric ex-pressions, so there are such variants of AltLexes like because of this / this fact / this situation (d?ky tomu / t?to skute?nosti / t?to situaci) etc.",
        "Other examples of prepositions (meant in the Czech originals ?",
        "see Kroupov?, 1984) from this group of AltLexes are in addition to (krom?",
        "), due to (kv?li), unlike (na rozd?l od), on the basis of (na z?klad?",
        "), despite (navzdory), in spite of (p?es), due to (vinou), considering (vzhledem k).",
        "As said above, these types of AltLexes must combine with some complementation due to their valency.",
        "Therefore, it is impossible to use, for example, *because of, I will do it (*kv?li to ud?l?m), but only because of this, I will do it (kv?li tomu to ud?l?m).",
        "So if there is some obligatory complementation, i.e. a general rule in all of these AltLexes, we may use this information for their automatic searching.",
        "Moreover, all of these prepositions function as AltLexes only if they combine with some anaphoric expression referring to the previous argument.",
        "If they occur with a non-anaphoric expression, they are not AltLexes, like in this example: (4) I was ill a whole month.",
        "I could not sleep due to cough at night.",
        "(In original: Marodila jsem cel?",
        "m?s?c.",
        "V noci jsem nemohla sp?t kv?li ka?li.)",
        "It is obvious that the expression due to cough (kv?li ka?li) from the second sentence does not refer to any part of the previous one and that it does not signal any discourse relation between the two sentences.",
        "On the contrary, there is the following example of the same preposition with anaphoric reference functioning as AltLex: (5) Italy saves.",
        "Because of this, some journals will no longer come out.",

        "den?ky.)",
        "In this example, the whole expression because of this (kv?li tomu) introduces a discourse relation of reason and result between the two arguments.",
        "We may replace it, for example, by the connective therefore (proto).",
        "It is obvious that combination of prepositions as due to (kv?li), because of (d?ky) with an anaphoric reference is, for them, a condition for being AltLex.",
        "This condition may be well used especially in corpora with annotated coreference as the Prague Dependency Treebank.",
        "4 Annotation of Coreference in PDT and Its Use for Discourse 4.1 Types of Coreference Annotation of coreference in PDT was finished in 2011 (cf. Nedoluzhko et al., 2011).",
        "The annotated relations are divided into four groups: a) grammatical coreference ?",
        "mostly inter-sentential coreference derivable using Czech grammatical rules (the vertical arrow in Fig. 1); b) textual coreference ?",
        "inter- and intra-sentential coreference of pronouns and nouns derivable only from the sentence meaning (the horizontal arrows in Fig. 1); c) bridging anaphora ?",
        "inter- and intra-sentential relations such as part-whole, subset-set, function etc.",
        "; d) special types of reference (exophora ?",
        "referring to elements outside the text, and segment ?",
        "referring to an unspecified larger part of the preceeding context) (see Nedoluzhko, 2011).",
        "4.2 AltLexes ?",
        "Coreference Leading to the Verbal Argument As said in the section 3, there is one group of Czech AltLexes functioning as discourse markers only in combination with some anaphoric expression.",
        "The second condition is that this anaphoric expression must refer to a (whole) verbal argument.",
        "PDT captures it in the tree structure with the highest verbal node representing the whole argument (discourse relations are realized by thick orange arrows leading between two verbal nodes symbolising the two arguments).3 It means that when searching for tokens from this group of AltLexes, we may omit anaphoric expressions referring to non-verbal parts of text ?",
        "see an example from PDT, depicted in Figure 1: 3 It is important to understand that coreference and all discourse relations, although technically annotated between two nodes, in fact express a relation between the whole subtrees of the two nodes, as (on the tectogrammatical layer of PDT) a node represents the whole subtree it governs.",

        "However, this plan (tento pl?n) does not refer to the whole previous argument (sen- tence) but only to its nominal part plan (pl?n) ?",
        "it means that there is annotated a coreference relation between these two nouns (see Figure 1 and the dark curved arrow between the two nodes plan in the two trees).",

        "see Figure 2 with the annotated coreference relation going from this (ten) to a verb to have (m?t).",
        "The discourse relation is represented by a thick orange arrow going from the verb to have (m?t) to a verb to look for (hledat).",
        "These examples demonstrate that tokens of this type of AltLexes in PDT may be automatically looked up on the basis of the two conditions: a) the preposition must combine with an anaphoric expression; b) this expression must be in a coreference or bridging relation (according to the finished annotation of coreference ?",
        "see Nedoluzhko et al., 2011) with some verbal node (representing the whole argument).",
        "4.3 Searching in the Data The primary format of PDT is called Prague Markup Language (PML).",
        "It is an abstract XML-based format designed for annotation of treebanks.",
        "For editing and processing data in the PML format, a highly 15 customizable tree editor TrEd4 was developed (Pajas and ?t?p?nek, 2008).",
        "The search was performed in PML Tree Query (PML-TQ)5, a powerful client-server based query engine for treebanks (Pajas and ?t?p?nek, 2010), with the client part implemented as an extension to the tree editor TrEd.",
        "Using the query engine, we searched for places in the data with a given preposition and an anaphoric expression relating to a verbal node either as grammatical coreference, textual coreference, bridging anaphora, or coreference to segment.",
        "The antecedent of the relation could either be directly the verbal node or a coordination or apposition of verbal nodes, or it could be unspecified in case of coreference to segment.",
        "Let us present a simplified example of such a query; this particular query searches for relevant places in the PDT data with a preposition due to (vinou) plus an anaphoric expression: 1 t-node $t := 2 [ (1+x coref_gram.rf t-node 3 [ gram/sempos = \"v\" ] or 4 1+x coref_text/target-node.rf t-node 5 [ gram/sempos = \"v\" ] or 6 1+x bridging/target-node.rf t-node 7 [ gram/sempos = \"v\" ] or 8 1+x coref_gram.rf t-node 9 [ nodetype = \"coap\", t-node 10 [ gram/sempos = \"v\" ] ] or 11 1+x coref_text/target-node.rf t-node 12 [ nodetype = \"coap\", t-node 13 [ gram/sempos = \"v\" ] ] or 14 1+x bridging/target-node.rf t-node 15 [ nodetype = \"coap\", t-node 16 [ gram/sempos = \"v\" ] ] or 17 coref_special = \"segm\"), 18 a/lex.rf|a/aux.rf a-node 19 [ m/form ~ \"^[Vv]inou$\" ] ]; 20 21 >> give $t.id Line 1 declares a tectogrammatical node (and names it $t for later reference), lines 2?17 specify a disjunction of seven possible ways of an anaphoric reference (lines 2 and 3 define a grammatical coreference from the given node to a verbal node (semantic part-of-speech equals \"v\"), lines 4 and 5 define the same condition for textual coreference, lines 6 and 7 for bridging anaphora.",
        "Lines 8?16 express the same three relations, this time with an anaphoric verbal node being a part of a coordination or apposition (the relation is between the given node $t and the node representing the coordination or apposition (nodetype=\"coap\")), and line 17 searches for a coreference to a not further specified segment).",
        "Lines 18 and 19 express that on the surface, the given node $t represents the preposition due to (vinou).",
        "Finally, an output filter on line 21 gives identifiers of positions in the data found by the query.",
        "For each preposition from a given list (see Table 1 below), the query produced a list of positions in the data.",
        "These positions were gone through by human annotators and discourse relations with all required additional information were marked there.",
        "4.4 Results, Evaluation and Discussion Altogether, PDT contains 1,482 tokens of selected prepositions (we worked with the types of prepositions that were, in some instances, marked as AltLexes in the preliminary phase of annotation).",
        "Within them, we have automatically looked up 89 instances functioning as AltLexes.",
        "The results demonstrate that using coreference annotation significantly helped reduce the final number of relevant instances (i.e. those being AltLexes) and that it substantially facilitated the annotation of discourse (instead of 1,482 instances, the human annotators had to go only through 89 of them, i.e. only through 6 % out of the total number in the whole PDT) ?",
        "see Table 1 that introduces the total number of all instances of given prepositions (in any role) in PDT and their final reduced numbers in the role of Alt-4 http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/tred/ 5 http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pmltq/ 16 Lexes.",
        "So, for example, the preposition in addition to (krom?)",
