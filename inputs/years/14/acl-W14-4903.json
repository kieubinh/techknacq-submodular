        "Abstract",
        "Recent work on error detection has shown that the quality of manually annotated corpora can be substantially improved by applying consistency checks to the data and automatically identifying incorrectly labelled instances.",
        "These methods, however, can not be used for automatically annotated corpora where errors are systematic and cannot easily be identified by looking at the variance in the data.",
        "This paper targets the detection of POS errors in automatically annotated corpora, so-called silver standards, showing that by combining different measures sensitive to annotation quality we can identify a large part of the errors and obtain a substantial increase in accuracy."

      "text": [
        "Today, linguistically annotated corpora are an indispensable resource for many areas of linguistic research.",
        "However, since the emergence of the first digitised corpora in the 60s, the field has changed considerably.",
        "What was considered ?very large?",
        "in the last decades is now considered to be rather small.",
        "Through the emergence of Web 2.0 and the spread of user-generated content, more and more data is accessible for building corpora for specific purposes.",
        "This presents us with new challenges for automatic preprocessing and annotation.",
        "While conventional corpora mostly include written text which complies to grammatical standards, the new generation of corpora contain texts from very different varieties, displaying features of spoken language, regional variety, ungrammatical content, typos and non-canonical spelling.",
        "A large portion of the vocabulary are unknown words (that is, not included in the training data).",
        "As a result, the accuracy of state-of-the-art NLP tools on this type of data is often rather low.",
        "In combination with the increasing corpus sizes, it seems that we have to lower our expectations with respect to the quality of the annotations.",
        "Time-consuming double annotation or a manual correction of the whole corpus is often not feasible.",
        "Thus, the use of so-called silver standards has been discussed (Hahn et al., 2010; Kang et al., 2012; Paulheim, 2013), along with their adequacy to replace carefully hand-crafted gold standard corpora.",
        "Other approaches to address this problem come from the areas of domain adaptation and error detection.",
        "In the first field, the focus is on adapting NLP tools or algorithms to data from new domains, thus increasing the accuracy of the tools.",
        "In error detection, the goal is to automatically identify erroneous labels in the data and either hand those instances to a human annotator for manual correction, or to automatically correct those cases.",
        "Here, the focus is not on improving the tools but on increasing the quality of the corpus and, at the same time, reducing human effort.",
        "These approaches are not mutually exclusive but can be seen as complementary methods for building high-quality language resources at a reasonable expense.",
        "We position our work at the interface of these fields.",
        "Our general objective is to build a high-quality linguistic resource for informal spoken youth language, annotated with parts of speech (POS) information.",
        "As we do not have the resources for proofing the whole corpus, we aim at building a silver standard where the quality of the annotations is high enough to be useful for linguistic research.",
        "For automatic ",
        "20 preprocessing, we use tagging models adapted to our data.",
        "The main contribution of this paper is in developing and evaluating methods for POS error detection in automatically annotated corpora.",
        "We show that our approach not only works for our data but can also be applied to canonical text from the newspaper domain, where the POS accuracy of standard NLP tools is quite high.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 reviews related work on detecting annotation errors in corpora.",
        "Section 3 describes the underlying assumptions of our approach.",
        "In Section 4, we describe the experimental setup and data used in our experiments, and we present our results in Section 5.",
        "We conclude in Section 6.",
        "2 Related Work Most work on (semi-)automatic POS error detection has focussed on identifying errors in POS assigned by human annotators where variation in word-POS assignments in the corpus can be caused either by ambiguous word forms which, depending on the context, can belong to different word classes, or by incorrect judgments made by the annotators (Eskin, 2000; van Halteren, 2000; Kv?eto?n and Oliva, 2002; Dickinson and Meurers, 2003; Loftsson, 2009).",
        "The variation n-gram algorithm (Dickinson and Meurers, 2003) allows users to identify potentially incorrect tagger predictions by looking at the variation in the assignment of POS tags to a particular word ngram.",
        "The algorithm produces a ranked list of varying tagger decisions which have to be processed by a human annotator.",
        "Potential tagger errors are positioned at the top of the list.",
        "Later work (Dickinson, 2006) extends this approach and explores the feasibility of automatically correcting these errors.",
        "Eskin (2000) describes a method for error identification using anomaly detection, where anomalies are defined as elements coming from a distribution different from the one in the data at hand.",
        "Kv?eto?n and Oliva (2002) present an approach to error detection based on a semi-automatically compiled list of impossible ngrams.",
        "Instances of these ngrams in the data are assumed to be tagging errors and are selected for manual correction.",
        "All these approaches are tailored towards identifying human annotation errors and cannot be applied to our setting where we have to detect systematic errors made by automatic POS taggers.",
        "Thus, we can not rely on anomalies or impossible ngrams in the data, as the errors made by the taggers are consistent and, furthermore, our corpus of non-canonical spoken language includes many structures which are considered impossible in Standard German.",
        "Rocio et al. (2007) address the problem of finding systematic errors in POS tagger predictions.",
        "Their method is based on a modified multiword unit extraction algorithm which extracts cohesive sequences of tags from the corpus.",
        "These sequences are then sorted manually into linguistically sound ngrams and potential errors.",
        "This approach addresses the correction of large, automatically annotated corpora.",
        "It successfully identifies (a small number of) incorrectly tagged high-frequency sequences in the text which are often based on tokenisation errors.",
        "The more diverse errors due to lexical ambiguity, which we have to deal with in our data, are not captured by this approach.",
        "Most promising is the approach of Loftsson (2009) who evaluates different methods for error detection, including an ensemble of five POS taggers, where error candidates are defined as those instances for which the predictions of the five taggers disagree.",
        "His method successfully identifies POS errors and thus increases the POS accuracy in the corpus.",
        "Using the tagger ensemble, Loftsson (2009) is able to identify error candidates with a precision of around 16%.",
        "He does not report recall, that is how many of the erroneously tagged instances in the corpus have been found.",
        "We apply the ensemble method to our data and use it as our baseline.",
        "Relevant to us is also the work by Dligach and Palmer (2011), who show how the need for double annotation can be efficiently reduced by only presenting carefully selected instances to the annotators for a second vote.",
        "They compare two different selection methods.",
        "In the first approach, they select all instances where a machine learning classifier disagrees with the human judgement.",
        "In the second approach, they use the probability score of a maximum entropy classifier, selecting instances with the smallest prediction margin (the difference between the probabilities for the two most probable predic-tions).",
        "Dligach and Palmer (2011) test their approach in a Word Sense Disambiguation task.",
        "The main 21 ideas of this work, however, can be easily applied to POS tagging.",
        "3 Identifying Systematic POS Errors Taggers make POS errors for a number of reasons.",
        "First of all, anomalies in the input can cause the tagger to assign an incorrect tag, e.g. for noisy input with spelling or tokenisation errors.",
        "Another source of errors are out-of-vocabulary words, that is word forms unknown to the tagger because they do not exist in the training data.",
        "A third reason for incorrect tagger judgments are word forms which are ambiguous between different parts of speech.",
        "Those cases can be further divided into cases where the information for identifying the correct label is there but the tagger does not make use of it, and into cases that are truly ambiguous, meaning that even a human annotator would not be able to disambiguate the correct POS tag.",
        "Tagger errors can also be caused by ill-defined annotation schemes or errors in the gold standard (see Manning (2011) for a detailed discussion on different types of POS errors).",
        "To assess the difficulty of the task, it might be interesting to look at the agreement achieved by human annotators for POS tagging German.",
        "The inter-annotator agreement for POS annotation with the STTS on written text is quite high with around 0.97-0.98 Fleiss ?, and for annotating spoken text using an extended version of the STTS similar numbers can be obtainded (Rehbein and Schalowski, 2013).",
        "In this work, we are not so much interested in finding tokenisation and spelling errors but in identifying automatic tagger errors due to lexical ambiguity.",
        "Our work is based on the following assumptions: Assumption 1: Instances of word forms which are labelled differently by different taggers are potential POS errors.",
        "Assumption 2: POS tags which have been assigned with a low probability by the tagger are potential POS errors.",
        "In the remainder of the paper, we present the development of a system for error detection and its evaluation on a corpus of informal, spontaneous dialogues and on German newspaper text.",
        "We report precision and recall for our system.",
        "Precision is computed as the number of correctly identified error candidates, divided by the number of all (correctly and incorrectly identified) error candidates (number of true positives / (number of true positives + false positives)), and recall by dividing the number of identified errors by the total number of errors in the data (true positives / (true positives + false negatives)).",
        "4 Experimental Setup The data we use in our experiments comes from two sources, i) from a corpus of informal, spoken German youth language (The KiezDeutsch Korpus (KiDKo) Release 1.0) (Rehbein et al., 2014), and ii) from the TIGER corpus (Brants et al., 2002), a German newspaper corpus.",

        "The current version of the corpus includes the audio signals aligned with tran-scriptions, as well as a normalisation layer and POS annotations.",
        "Additional annotation layers (Chunk- ing, Topological Fields) are in progress.",
        "The transcription scheme has an orthographic basis but, in order to enable investigations of prosodic characteristics of the data, it also tries to closely capture the pronunciation, including pauses, and encodes disfluencies and primary accents.",
        "On the normalisation layer, non-canonical pronunciations and capitalisation are reduced to standard German spelling.",
        "The normalisation is done on the token level, and non-canonical word order as well as disfluencies are included in the normalised version of the data (Example 1).",
