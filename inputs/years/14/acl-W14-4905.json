        "Syntactic parsing has been an attractive topic for both theoretical and computational linguists for many years.",
        "In combination with supervised machine learning techniques, several corpus-based parsers have been implemented (e.g., (Nivre et al., 2007), (de Marneffe et al., 2006), (McDonald et al., 2005)), combined (e.g., (Surdeanu and Manning, 2010)), and adapted (e.g., (McClosky et al., 2010),(Zhang and Wang, 2009)).",
        "The performance of such techniques directly correlates with the size of training data: the more annotated data, the better.",
        "However, the annotation process is very resource consuming, thus we have been seeking for alternative ways of faster and cheaper annotation.",
        "Namely, we have been inspired by the solution of crowdsourcing, see e.g. (Brabham, 2013).",
        "In Czech schools, practicing morphology and syntax is an obligatory part of the curriculum.",

        "In addition, the editor can be used for drawing sentence diagrams in any natural language.",
        "On the other hand, transformation rules have to be specified with respect to a particular target annotation scheme.",
        "We introduced this approach in (Hana and Hladk?a, 2012).",
        "Data quality belongs to the most important issues related to crowdsourcing, see e.g. (Sabou et al., 2012), (Wang et al., 2010), (Hsueh et al., 2009).",

        ": one for the subject and one for predicate.",
        "However, it is trivial to transform them into the corresponding tree, considering the subject to be the daughter of the predicate.",
