        "Annotation of discourse typically involves three subtasks: segmentation (identification of discourse units, including their boundaries), segment classification (labeling the role of discourse units) and relation identification (indicating the link between the discourse units) (Peldszus and Stede, 2013a).",
        "The difficulty of achieving an Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) of .80, which is generally accepted as good agree-ment, is compounded in studies of discourse annotations since annotators must unitize, i.e. identify the boundaries of discourse units (Artstein and Poesio, 2008).",
        "The inconsistent assignment of boundaries in annotation of discourse has been noted at least since Grosz and Sidner (1986) who observed that although annotators tended to identify essentially the same units, the boundaries differed slightly.",
        "The need for annotators to identify the boundaries of text segments makes measurement of IAA more difficult because standard coefficients such as ?",
        "assume that the units to be coded have been identified before the coding begins (Artstein and Poesio, 2008).",
        "A second challenge for measuring IAA for discourse annotation is associated with larger numbers of annotators.",
        "Because of the many ways that ideas are expressed in human language, using multiple annotators to study discourse phenomena is important.",
        "Such an approach capitalizes on the aggregated intuitions of multiple coders to overcome the potential biases of any one coder and helps identify limitations in the coding scheme, thus adding to the reliability and validity of the annotation study.",
        "The more annotators, however, the harder it is to achieve an IAA of .80 (Bayerl and Paul, 2011).",
        "What to annotate also depends, among other characteristics, on the phenomenon of interest, the text being annotated, the quality of the annotation scheme and the effectiveness of training.",
        "But even if these are excellent, there is natural variability in human judgment for a task that involves subtle distinctions about which competent coders disagree.",
        "An accurate computational model should reflect this variability (Aakhus et al., 2013).",

        "PAT states that argument can arise at any point when two or more actors engage in calling out and making problematic some aspect of another actor's prior contribution for what it (could have) said or meant (Van Eemeren et al., 1993).",

        "(Krip- pendorff, 1995; Krippendorff, 2004b), which was developed for content analysis in the social sciences, provide inconsistent results when applied to segmentations involving fuzzy boundaries and multiple coders.",
        "In addition, these metrics do not tell us which parts of a text are easier or harder to annotate, or help choose a reliable gold standard.",
        "Our second contribution is a new method for assessing IAA using hierarchical clustering to find parts of text that are easier or harder to annotate.",
        "These clusters could serve as the basis for assessing the performance of systems that automatically identify ADUs the system would be rewarded for identifying ADUs that are easier for people to recognize and penalized for identifying ADUs that are relatively hard for people to recognize.",
        "2 Annotation Study of Argumentative Discourse Units: Callouts and Targets In this section, we describe the annotation study we conducted to determine whether trained human judges can reliably identify Callouts and Targets.",
        "The main annotation task was to find Callouts and the Targets to which they are linked and unitize them, i.e., assign boundaries to each ADU.",
        "As mentioned above, these are the steps for argument mining delineated in Peldszus and Stede (2013a).",
        "The design of 121 the study was consistent with the conditions for generating reliable annotations set forth in Krippendorff (2004a, p. 217).",
        "We selected five blog postings from a corpus crawled from Technorati (technorati.com) between 2008- 2010; the comments contain many disputes.",
        "We used the first 100 comments on each blog as our corpus, along with the original posting.",
        "We refer to each blog and the associated comments as a thread.",
        "The complexity of the phenomenon required the perspective of multiple independent annotators, despite the known difficulty in achieving reliable IAA with more than two annotators.",
        "For our initial study, in which our goal was to obtain naturally occurring examples of Callouts and Targets and assess the challenges of reliably identifying them, we engaged five graduate students with a strong humanities background.",
        "The coding was performed with the open-source Knowtator software (Ogren, 2006).",
        "All five judges annotated all 100 comments in all five threads.",
        "While the annotation process was under way, annotators were instructed not to communicate with each other about the study.",

        "task was to find each instance of a Callout, determine the boundaries, link the Callout to the most recent Target and determine the boundaries of the Target.",

        "We plan to study chains of responses in future work.",
        "Prior to the formal study, each annotator spent approximately eight hours in training, spread over about two weeks, under the supervision of a PhD student who had helped to develop the guidelines.",
