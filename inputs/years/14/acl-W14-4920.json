        "We present an interactive procedure to annotate a large-scale corpus of Modern Standard and Egyptian Arabic tweets for event modality that comprises obligation, permission, commitment, ability, and volition.",
        "The procedure splits up the annotation process into a series of simplified questions, dispenses with the requirement of expert linguistic knowledge, and captures nested modality triggers and their attributes semi-automatically."

        "Event modality, according to Palmer (2001), describes events that are not actualized but are merely potential.",
        "It comprises obligation, permission, commitment, ability, and volition.",
        "Both obligation and permission emanate from an external authority such as the law; whereas commitments are the obligations placed by speakers on themselves as in promises.",
        "Ability is the (in)capacity to do something.",
        "Volition is broadly defined as intensions, desires, wishes, and preferences.",
        "Event modality is used for several NLP tasks, including sales and marketing analysis (Ramanand et al. 2010, Carlos and Yalamanchi 2012), sentiment analysis (Chardon et al. 2013), the automatic detection of request emails (Lampert et al. 2010), and the classification of animacy and writers' emotions (Liao and Liao 2009, Bowman and Chopra 2012).",
        "To-date, there are no large-scale Arabic corpora annotated for event modality compared to English (Baker et al. 2010, 2012; Rubinstein et al. 2013), Japanese (Matsuyoshi et al. 2010), Portuguese (Hendrickx et al. 2012), and Chinese (Cui and Chi 2013).",
        "One obstacle for the creation of modality-annotated corpora is the lack of consensus definitions of modality and its attributes to be rendered into annotation tasks and guidelines.",
        "Furthermore, most modality annotation schemes use sophisticated theoretical guidelines that need annotators with linguistic background; hence, annotation typically takes place in in-lab settings at small scales.",
        "In this paper, we present an interactive annotation procedure to annotate event modality and its attributes of sense, polarity, intensification, tense, holders, and scopes in Modern Standard and Egyptian Arabic tweets.",
        "The procedure depicts the following ideas: first, it defines each annotation task as a series of questions displayed1/hidden based on prior answers; second, it avoids lengthy theoretically-sophisticated definitions and uses the questions instead as simplified self-explanatory annotation prompts; and third, based on the elicited answers it automatically determines nested triggers and their attributes.",
        "The fact that our procedure does not require special linguistic background and consists of easy-to-administer questions makes it eligible for large-scale crowdsourcing annotation.",
        "Our corpus comprises 9949 unique tweets, annotated for 12134 tokens that map to 315 unique types of event modality triggers and their attributes of sense, polarity, intensification, tense, holders, and scopes.",
        "The reason to work on the genre of tweets is that our corpus is part of a larger project to incorporate linguistic features, such as modality, with network-based features to automatically identify the key players of political discourse on Twitter for countries with fast-changing politics such as Egypt.",
        "The fact that our corpus is harvested from the Arabic Egyptian Twitter entails that the corpus is diglossic for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "License details: http:// creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ 139 formal Arabic variety, and Egyptian Arabic (EA), the native Arabic dialect of Egypt.",
        "We evaluate the annotation results with Krippendorff's alpha (Krippendorff 2011).",
        "Results show high inter-annotator reliability rates, indicating that our annotation scheme and procedure are effective.",
        "The contribution of this paper, therefore, is twofold: first, we create a novel annotated resource for Arabic NLP that is larger than existing corpora even for languages other than Arabic; and second, we present an efficient and easy-to-administer annotation procedure with interactive crowdsourcing potentials.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the annotation scheme, guidelines and the interactive procedure; Section 3 gives examples for the final output representations; Section 4 describes corpus harvesting and sampling; Section 5 provides the annotation results and disagreement analysis; and Section 6 compares and contrasts our work with related work.",
        "2 Annotation Scheme: Tasks and Guidelines Our annotation scheme comprises six tasks to label sense, polarity, intensification, tense, holders, and scopes for each event modality.",
        "Prior to the beginning of the interactive procedure, we highlight all event modalities in each tweet using a string-match algorithm and the lexicons from Al-Sabbagh et al. (2013, 2014a).",
        "The algorithm finds all potential event modality triggers (i.e. words/phrases that convey event modality) within each tweet in our corpus and marks them as annotation units.",
        "A total of 12134 candidate triggers are highlighted in 9949 tweets.",
        "2.1 Task 1: Sense Sense annotation is to decide for each candidate trigger in context whether it actually conveys event modality given the tweet's context.",

        "Each event modality sense is represented by an exemplar set manually selected so that: (1) each exemplar is an unambiguous event modality trigger; (2) exemplars are in both MSA and EA; (3) exemplars comprise both simple words and multiword expressions; (4) exemplars are both affirmative and negative; and (5) exemplars are of different intensities.",
        "Presented with a pre-highlighted candidate trigger in context and the exemplar sets, annotations are to decide whether the candidate trigger is synonymous with any of the exemplar sets.",
        "If not, the trigger is then assumed as non-modal.",
        "If an annotator decides that a given candidate trigger is a non-modal, no further questions about polarity, intensification, tense, holders, or scopes are displayed.",
