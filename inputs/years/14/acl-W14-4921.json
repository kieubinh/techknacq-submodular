        "Abstract",
        "This paper presents an annotation scheme for a new semantic annotation task with relevance for analysis and computation at both the clause level and the discourse level.",
        "More specifically, we label the finite clauses of texts with the type of situation entity (e.g., eventualities, statements about kinds, or statements of belief) they introduce to the discourse, following and extending work by Smith (2003).",
        "We take a feature-driven approach to annotation, with the result that each clause is also annotated with fundamental aspectual class, whether the main NP referent is specific or generic, and whether the situation evoked is episodic or habitual.",
        "This annotation is performed (so far) on three sections of the MASC corpus, with each clause labeled by at least two annotators.",
        "In this paper we present the annotation scheme, statistics of the corpus in its current version, and analyses of both inter-annotator agreement and intra-annotator consistency."

        "Linguistic expressions form patterns in discourse.",
        "Passages of text can be analyzed in terms of the individuals, concepts, times and situations that they introduce to the discourse.",
        "In this paper we introduce a new semantic annotation task which focuses on the latter and in particular their aspectual nature.",
        "Situations are expressed at the clause level; situation entity (SE) annotation is the task of associating individual clauses of text with the type of SE introduced to the discourse by the clause.",
        "Following Smith (2003), we distinguish the following SE types (see Sec.",
        "3.1): EVENTS, STATES, GENERALIZING SEN-TENCES, GENERIC SENTENCES, FACTS, PROPOSITIONS, QUESTIONS and IMPERATIVES.",
        "Although these categories are clearly distinct from one another on theoretical grounds, in practice it can be difficult to cleanly draw boundaries between them.",
        "We improve annotation consistency by defining the SE types in terms of features whose values are easier for annotators to identify, and which provide guidance for distinguishing the more complex SE types.",
        "As with most complex annotation tasks, multiple interpretations are often possible, and we cannot expect agreement on all instances.",
        "The feature-driven approach (see Sec.",
        "3.2) is a valuable source of information for investigating annotator disagreements, as the features indicate precisely how annotators differ in their interpretation of the situation.",
        "Analysis of intra-annotator consistency shows that personal preferences of annotators play a role, and we conclude that disagreements often highlight cases where multiple interpretations are possible.",
        "We further argue that such cases should be handled carefully in supervised learning approaches targeting methods to automatically classify situation entity types.",
        "As the first phase of the SE annotation project, we are in the process of annotating the written portion of MASC (Ide et al., 2010), the manually-annotated subcorpus of the Open American National Corpus.",
        "MASC provides texts from 20 different genres and has already been annotated with various linguistic and semantic phenomena.",
        "1 MASC offers several benefits: it includes text from a wide variety of genres, it facilitates study of interactions between various levels of analysis, and the data is freely available with straightforward mechanisms for distribution.",
        "In this paper we report results for three of the MASC This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "1 http://www.americannationalcorpus.org/MASC/Full_MASC.html 149 genres: news, letters, and jokes.",
        "Once a larger portion of MASC has been labeled with SEs and their associated features, we will add our annotations to those currently available for MASC.",
        "We mark the SE types of clauses with the aim of providing a large corpus of annotated text for the following purposes: (1) To assess the applicability of SE type classification as described by Smith (2003): to what extent can situations be classified easily, which borderline cases occur, and how do humans perform on this task?",
        "(see Sec.",
        "4) (2) Training, development and evaluation of automatic systems classifying situation entities, as well as sub-tasks which have (partially) been studied by the NLP community, but for which no large annotated corpora are available (for example, automatically predicting the fundamental aspectual class of verbs in context (Friedrich and Palmer, 2014) or the genericity of clauses and noun phrases).",
        "(3) To provide a foundation for analysis of the theory of Discourse Modes (Smith, 2003), which we explain next (Sec.",
        "2).",
        "2 Background and related work Within a text, one recognizes stretches that are intuitively of different types and can be clustered by their characteristic linguistic features and interpretations.",
        "Smith (2003) posits five discourse modes: Narrative, Report, Description, Informative and Argument/Commentary.",
        "Texts of almost all genre categories have passages of different modes.",
        "The discourse modes are characterized by (a) the type of situations (also called situation entities) introduced in a text passage, and (b) the principle of text progression in the mode (temporal or atemporal, and different manners of both temporal and atemporal progression).",
        "This annotation project directly addresses the first of these characteristics, the situation entity types (SE types).",
        "Some previous work has addressed the task of classifying SE types at the clause level.",
        "Palmer et al. (2004) enrich LFG parses with lexical information from both a database of lexical conceptual structures (Dorr, 2001) and hand-collected groups of predicates associated with particular SE types.",
        "The enriched parses are then fed to an ordered set of transfer rules which encode linguistic features indicative of SE types.",
        "The system is evaluated on roughly 200 manually-labeled clauses.",
        "Palmer et al. (2007) investigate various types of linguistic features in a maximum entropy model for SE type classification.",
        "The best results are still below 50% accuracy (with a most-frequent-class baseline of 38%), and incorporating features from neighboring clauses is shown to increase performance.",
        "Palmer et al. (2007) annotate data from one section of the Brown corpus and a small amount of newswire text, with two annotators and no clear set annotation guidelines.",
        "In addition, work by Cocco (2012) classifies clauses of French text according to a six-way scheme that falls somewhere between the SE level and the level of discourse modes.",
        "The types are: narrative, argumentative, descriptive, explicative, dialogal, and injunctive.",
        "Other related works address tasks related to the features we annotate.",
        "One strand of work is in automatic classification of aspectual class (Siegel and McKeown, 2000; Siegel, 1999; Siegel, 1998; Klavans and Chodorow, 1992; Friedrich and Palmer, 2014) and its determination as part of temporal classification (UzZaman et al., 2013; Bethard, 2013; Costa and Branco, 2012).",
        "A second aims to distinguish generic vs. specific clauses (Louis and Nenkova, 2011) or to identify generic noun phrases (Reiter and Frank, 2010).",
        "The latter work leverages data with noun phrases annotated as either generic and specific from the ACE-2 corpus (Mitchell et al., 2003); their definitions of these two types match ours (see Sec.",
        "3.2.1).",
        "3 Annotation Scheme and Process In this section, we first present the inventory of SE types (Sec.",
        "3.1).",
        "We then describe our feature-driven approach to annotation (Sec.",
        "3.2) and define the SE types with respect to three situation-related features: main referent type, fundamental aspectual class, and habituality.",
        "Some situation entity types are easier to recognize than others.",
        "While some can be identified on the basis of surface structure and clear linguistic indicators, others depend on internal temporal (and other) properties of the verb and its arguments.",
        "Annotators take the following approach: first, easily-identifiable SE types (Speech Acts and",
        "Abstract",
        "Entities) are marked.",
        "If the clause's SE type is not one of these, values for the three features are determined, and the final determination of SE type is based on the features.",
        "150 3.1 Situation entity types Following Smith (2003), we distinguish the following SE types: Eventualities.",
        "These types describe particular situations such as STATES (1a) or EVENTS (2).",
        "The type REPORT, a subtype of EVENT, is used for situations introduced by verbs of speech (1b).",
        "(1) (a) ?Carl is a tenacious fellow?, (STATE) (b) said a source close to USAir.",
        "(EVENT ?",
        "REPORT) (2) The lobster won the quadrille.",
        "(EVENT) General Statives.",
        "This class includes GENERALIZING SENTENCES (3), which report regularities related to specific main referents, and GENERIC SENTENCES (4), which make statements about kinds.",

        "(GENERALIZING) (4) The lion has a bushy tail.",
        "(GENERIC)",
        "Abstract",
        "Entities are the third class of SE types, and comprise FACTS (5) and PROPOSITIONS (6).",
        "These situations differ from the other types in how they relate to the world: Eventualities and General Statives are located spatially and temporally in the world, but",
        "Abstract",
        "Entities are not.",
        "FACTS are objects of knowledge and PROPOSITIONS are objects of belief from the respective speaker's point of view.",
        "(5) I know that Mary refused the offer.",
        "(FACT) (6) I believe that Mary refused the offer .",
        "(PROPOSITION) We limit the annotation of",
        "Abstract",
        "Entities to the clausal complements of certain licensing predicates, as well as clauses modified by a certain class of adverbs, as it is not always possible to identify sentences directly expressing Facts or Propositions on linguistic grounds (Smith, 2003).",
        "In (6), believe is the licensing predicate, and Mary refused the offer is a situation that is introduced as not being in the world, but about the world (Smith, 2003).",
        "Annotators are asked to additionally label the embedded SE type when possible.",
        "For example, that Mary refused the offer in (5) and (6) would be labeled as EVENT.",
        "Speech Acts.",
        "This class comprises QUESTIONS and IMPERATIVE clauses (Searle, 1969).",
        "Derived SE types.",
        "In some cases, the SE type of a clause changes based on the addition of some linguistic indication of uncertainty about the status of the situation described.",
        "We refer to these as derived SE types.",
        "More specifically, clauses that would otherwise be marked as EVENT may be coerced to the type STATE due to negation, modality, future tense, conditionality, and sometimes subjectivity: e.g. John did not win the lottery, a negated event, introduces a STATE to the discourse.",
        "3.2 Features for distinguishing situation entity types In this section, we describe three features that allow for the clear expression of differences between SE types.",
        "Fleshing out the descriptions of SE types with these underlying features is useful to convey the annotation scheme to new annotators, to get partial information when an annotator has trouble making a decision on SE type, and to analyze disagreements between annotators.",
        "3.2.1 Main referent type: specific or generic This feature indicates the type of the most central entity mentioned in the clause as a noun phrase.",
        "We refer to this entity as the clause's main referent.",
        "This referent can be found by asking the question: What is this clause about?",
        "Usually, but not always, the main referent of a clause is realized as its grammatical subject.",
        "We appeal to the annotator's intuitions in order to determine the main referent of a clause.",
        "In case the main referent does not coincide with the grammatical subject as in example (7), this is to be indicated during annotation.",
        "(7) There are two books on the table.",
        "(specific main referent, STATE) 151 Some SE types (STATES, GENERALIZING SENTENCES and GENERIC SENTENCES, for details see Table 1) are distinguished by whether they make a statement about some specific main referent or about a generic main referent.",
        "Specific main referents are particular entities (8), particular groups of entities (9), organizations (10), particular situations (11) or particular instantiations of a concept (12).",
        "(8) Mary likes popcorn.",
        "(particular entity ?",
        "specific, STATE) (9) The students met at the cafeteria.",
        "(a particular group ?",
        "specific, STATE) (10) IBM was a very popular company in the 80s.",
        "(organization ?",
        "specific, STATE) (11) That she didn't answer her phone really upset me.",
        "(particular situation ?",
        "specific, EVENT) (12) Today's weather was really nice.",
        "(particular instantiation of a concept ?",
        "specific, STATE) The majority of generic main referents are noun phrases referring to a kind rather than to a particular entity, and generic mentions of concepts or notions (14).",
        "Definite NPs and bare plural NPs (13) are the main kind-referring NP types (Smith, 2003).",
        "(13) The lion has a bushy tail.",
        "/ Dinosaurs are extinct.",
        "(generic, GENERIC SENTENCE) (14) Security is an important issue in US electoral campaigns.",
        "(generic, GENERIC SENTENCE) While some NPs clearly make reference to a well-established kind, other cases are not so clear cut, as humans tend to make up a context in which an NP describes some kind (Krifka et al., 1995).",
        "Sentence (15) gives an example for such a case: while lions in captivity are not a generally well-established kind, this term describes a class of entities rather than a specific group of lions in this context.",
        "(15) Lions in captivity have trouble producing offspring.",
        "(generic, GENERIC SENTENCE) Gerunds may occur as the subject in English sentences.",
        "When they describe a specific process as in (16a), we mark them as specific.",
        "If they instead describe a kind of process as in (16b), we mark them as generic.",
        "(16) (a) Knitting this scarf took me 3 days.",
        "(specific, EVENT) (b) Knitting a scarf is generally fun.",
        "(generic, GENERIC SENTENCE) We also give annotators the option to explicitly mark the main referent as expletive, as in (17).",
        "(17) It seemed like (expletive = no main referent, STATE) he would win.",
        "(specific, STATE) 3.2.2 Fundamental aspectual class: stative or dynamic Following Siegel and McKeown (2000), we determine the fundamental aspectual class of a clause.",
        "This notion is the extension of lexical aspect or aktionsart, which describe the ?real life shape?",
        "of situations denoted by verbs, to the level of clauses.",
        "More specifically, aspectual class is a feature of the main verb and a select group of modifiers, which may differ per verb.",
        "The stative/dynamic distinction is the most fundamental distinction in taxonomies of aspectual class (Vendler, 1967; Bach, 1986; Mourelatos, 1978).",
        "We allow three labels for this feature: dynamic for cases where the verb and its arguments describe some event (something happens), stative for cases where they introduce some properties of the main referent to the discourse, or both for cases where annotators see both interpretations.",
        "It is important to note that the fundamental aspectual class of a verb can be different from the type of situation entity introduced by the clause as a whole.",
        "The basic situation type of building a house is dynamic, and in the examples below we see this fundamental aspectual class appearing in clauses with different situation entity types.",
        "Example (18) describes an EVENT.",
        "Clause (19), on the other hand, is a GENERALIZING SENTENCE, as it describes a pattern of events; this is a situation with a derived type.",
        "The same is true for example (20), which is a STATE because of its future tense.",
        "(18) John built a house.",
        "(EVENT, dynamic fundamental aspectual class) (19) John builds houses.",
        "(GENERALIZING SENTENCE, dynamic fundamental aspectual class) (20) John is going to build a house.",
        "(STATE, dynamic fundamental aspectual class) 152 3.2.3 Habituality Another dimension along which situations can be distinguished is whether they describe a static state, a one-time (episodic) event (21) or some regularity of an event (22) or a state (23), which is labeled habitual.",
        "The term habitual as used in this annotation project covers more than what is usually considered a matter of habit, extending to any clauses describing regularities (24).",
        "The discussion related to this linguistic feature in this section follows Carlson (2005).",
        "If one can add a frequency adverbial such as typically/usually to the clause and the meaning of the resulting sentence differs at most slightly from the meaning of the original sentence, or the sentence contains a frequency adverbial such as never, the sentence expresses a regularity, i.e., is habitual.",
        "Another property of habituals is that they are generalizations and hence have the property of tolerating exceptions.",
        "If we learn that Mary eats oatmeal for breakfast, it does not necessarily need to be true that she eats oatmeal at every breakfast.",
        "It is important to note that unlike fundamental aspectual class, habituality is an attribute of the entire situation.",
        "(21) Mary ate oatmeal for breakfast this morning.",
        "(episodic, EVENT) (22) Mary eats oatmeal for breakfast.",
        "(habitual, GENERALIZING SENTENCE) (23) I often feel as if I only get half the story.",
        "(habitual, stative fundamental aspectual class, GENERALIZING SENTENCE) (24) Glass breaks easily.",
        "(habitual, GENERIC SENTENCE) 3.3 SE types and their features The feature-driven approach to annotation taken here is defined such that, ideally, each unique combination of values for the three features leads to one SE type.",
        "Table 1 shows the assignment of SE types to various combinations of feature values.",
        "This table covers all SE types except ABSTRACT ENTITIES and SPEECH ACTS, which are more easily identifiable based on lexical and/or syntactic grounds.",
        "Annotators are also provided with information about linguistic tests for some SE types and feature values, both for making feature value determinations and to support selection of clause-level SE type labels.",

        "4 Annotator agreement and consistency This section presents analyses of inter-annotator agreement and intra-annotator consistency, looking at agreement for individual feature values as well as clause-level SE type.",
        "4.1 Data and annotators The current version of our corpus consists of three sections (news, letters and jokes) of MASC corpus (Ide et al., 2010).",
        "We hired three annotators, all either native or highly-skilled speakers of English, and had a training phase of 3 weeks using several Wikipedia documents.",
        "Afterwards, annotation of the texts began and annotators had no further communication with each other.",
