        "Abstract",
        "When PRC was founded on mainland China and the KMT retreated to Taiwan in 1949, the relation between mainland China and Taiwan became a classical Cold War instance.",
        "Neither travel, visit, nor correspondences were allowed between the people until 1987, when government on both sides started to allow small number of Taiwan people with relatives in China to return to visit through a third location.",
        "Although the thawing eventually lead to frequent exchanges, direct travel links, and close commercial ties between Taiwan and mainland China today, 38 years of total isolation from each other did allow the language use to develop into different varieties, which have become a popular topic for mainly lexical studies (e.g., Xu, 1995; Zeng, 1995; Wang & Li, 1996).",
        "Grammatical difference of these two variants, however, was not well studied beyond anecdotal observation, partly because the near identity of their grammatical systems.",
        "This paper focuses on light verb variations in Mainland and Taiwan variants and finds that the light verbs of these two variants indeed show distributional tendencies.",
        "Light verbs are chosen for two reasons: first, they are semantically bleached hence more susceptible to changes and variations.",
        "Second, the classification of light verbs is a challenging topic in NLP.",
        "We hope our study will contribute to the study of light verbs in Chinese in general.",
        "The data adopted for this study was a comparable corpus extracted from Chinese Gigaword Corpus and manually annotated with contextual features that may contribute to light verb variations.",
        "A multivariate analysis was conducted to show that for each light verb there is at least one context where the two variants show differences in tendencies (usually the presence/absence of a tendency rather than contrasting tendencies) and can be differentiated.",
        "In addition, we carried out a K-Means clustering analysis for the variations and the results are consistent with the multivariate analysis, i.e. the light verbs in Mainland and Taiwan indeed have variations and the variations can be successfully differentiated.",
        "1 Introduction: Language Variations in the Chinese Context Commonly dichotomy of language and dialect is not easily maintained in the context of Chinese language(s).",
        "Cantonese, Min, Hakka, and Wu are traditionally referred to as dialects of Chinese but are mutually unintelligible.",
        "However, they do share a common writing system and literary and textual tradition, which allows speakers to have a shared linguistic identity.",
        "To overcome the mutual unintelligibility problem, a variant of Northern Mandarin Chinese, is designated as the common language about a hundred years ago (called ???",
        "Putonghua ?common language?",
        "in Mainland China, and ??",
        "Guoyu ?national language?",
        "in Taiwan).",
        "Referred to as Mandarin or Mandarin Chinese, or simply Chinese nowadays, this is the one of the most commonly learned first or second languages in the world now.",
        "However, not unlike English, with the fast globalization of the Chinese language, both the term ?World Chineses?",
        "and the recognition that there are different variants of Chinese emerged.",
        "In this paper, we studied two of the most important variants of Chinese, Mainland Mandarin and Taiwan Mandarin.",
        "1 1.1 Variations between Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin: Previous studies The lexical differences between Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin have been the focus of research in Chinese Linguistics in the recent years.",
        "A number of studies were carried out on lexical variations between these two variants of Mandarin Chinese, including variations in the meanings of the same word or using different words to express the same meaning (e.g., Xu, 1995; Zeng, 1995; Wang,1996).",
        "Some dictionaries also list the lexical differences between Mainland Mandarin and Taiwan Mandarin (e.g., Qiu, 1990; Wei & Sheng, 2000).",
        "By contrast, only a few of such studies were corpus driven (e.g. Hong and Huang 2008, 2013; Huang and Lin, 2013), and even few studies have been done on the grammatical variations of Mainland and Taiwan Chinese.",
        "Huang et al. (2013), the only such study based on comparable corpora so far, suggested that the subtlety of the underlining grammatical variations of these two dialectal variants at early stage of divergence may have contributed to the challenge as well as scarcity of previous studies.",
        "1.2 Light Verbs in Light Verb Variations The study of English light verb constructions (LVCs) (e.g., take a look, make an offer) has been an important topic in linguistics (Jespersen, 1965; Butt and Geuder, 2003; among others) as well as in Computational Linguistics (Tu and Dan, 2011; Nagy et al., 2013; Hwang et al., 2010; among others).",
        "Identification of LVCs is a fundamental crucial task for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as information retrieval and machine translation.",
        "For example, Tu and Dan (2011) proposed a supervised learning system to automatically identify English LVCs by training with groups of contextual or statistical features.",
        "Nagy et al. (2013) introduced a system that enables the full coverage identification of English LVCs in running context by using a machine leaning approach.",
        "However, little work has been done to identify Chinese LVCs, especially between different variants of Chinese (cf. Hwang et al., 2010).",
        "Chinese LVCs are similar to English LVCs in the sense that the light verb itself is semantically bleached and does not contain any eventive or contentive information, so the predicative information of the construction mainly comes from the complement taken by the light verb (e.g., Zhu, 1985; Zhou, 1987; Cai, 1982).",
        "For instance, ??",
        "jinxing originally meant ?move forward/proceed?, but in an LVC such as????",
        "jinxing taolun proceed discuss ?to discuss?, ??",
        "jinxing only contributes aspectual information whereas the core meaning of the LVC comes from the complement ??",
        "taolun ?discuss?.",
        "Chinese also differs from English in that many of the Chinese light verbs have similar usages and thus are often interchangeable, e.g., all the five light verbs ??",
        "congshi, ?",
        "gao, ??",
        "jiayi, ??",
        "jinxing, and ?",
        "zuo can take ??",
        "yanjiu ?do research?",
        "as their complement and form a LVC.",
        "But Huang et al. (2013) also observed that differences in collocation constraints can sometimes be found between different variants of Mandarin Chinese.",
        "For instance, constructions like ????",
        "jinxing tou-piao proceed cast-ticket ?to cast votes?, where the complement is in the V(erb)-O(bject) form, usually can only be found in Taiwan Mandarin.",
        "Hence, Chinese LVCs are challenging for both linguistic studies and computational applications in two aspects: (a) to identify collocation constraints of the different light verbs in order to automatically classify and predict their uses in context, and (b) to identify the collocation constraints of the same light verb in order to differentiate and predict the two Chinese variants based on the use of such light verbs.",
        "The first issue has been explored in Lin et al. (2014): by analyzing Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin data extracted from comparable corpora with statistical and machine learning approaches, the authors find the five light verbs??",
        "congshi, ?",
        "gao, ??",
        "jiayi, ??",
        "jinxing, and ?",
        "zuo can be reliably differentiated from each other in each variety.",
        "But to the best of our knowledge, there has been no previous computational study on modeling the light verb variations, or other syntactic variations of Chinese dialects or variants of the same dialect.",
        "Therefore, this paper builds on the study of Lin et al. (2014) and will adopt a comparable corpus driven approach to model light verb variations in Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin.",
        "2 Data and annotation Our study focuses on five light verbs, ??",
        "jiayi, ??",
        "jinxing, ??",
        "congshi, ?",
        "gao and ?",
        "zuo (these words literally meant ?proceed?, ?inflict?, ?engage?, ?do?, and ?do?",
        "respectively).",
        "These five are 2 chosen for two reasons.",
        "First, they are the most frequently used light verbs in Mandarin Chinese (Diao, 2004); second, although the definition of Chinese light verbs is still debatable, these five are considered the most typical light verbs in most previous studies.",
        "The data for this study was extracted from the Annotated Chinese Gigaword Corpus (Huang, 2009) maintained by LDC which contains over 1.1 billion Chinese words, consisting of 700 million characters from Taiwan Central News Agency (CNA) and 400 million characters from Mainland Xinhua News Agency (XNA).",
        "For each of the five light verbs, 400 sentences were randomly selected, half from the Mainland XNA corpus and the other half from the Taiwan CNA Corpus, which results in 2,000 sentences in total.",
        "Previous studies (Zhu, 1985; Zhou, 1987; Cai, 1982; Huang et al., 2013; among others) have proposed several syntactic and semantic features to compare and identify the similarities and differences among light verbs.",
        "For example, while Taiwan ??",
        "congshi can take informal or semantically negative event complements such as ???",
        "xingjiaoyi ?sexual trade?, Mainland ??",
        "congshi is rarely found with such complements (Huang et al. 2013).",
        "In our study, we selected 11 features covering both syntactic and semantic features which may help to identify light verb variations, as in Table 1.",
        "All 2,000 sentences with light verbs were manually annotated with the 11 features.",
        "The annotator is a trained expert on Chinese linguistics.",
        "All ambiguous cases were discussed with another two experts in order to reach an agreement (the features and annotation were the same with Lin et al. (2014)).",
        "3 Modelling and Predicting Two Variants We carried out both a multivariate analysis and machine learning algorithm to explore the possible differences existing between Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin light verbs.",
        "Our analysis shows that for each light verb, there is at least one context where the two variants of Mandarin show differences in usage tendencies and thus can be differentiated, although the differences more often lie in the presence/absence of a tendency rather than complementary distribution.",
        "3.1 Multivariate Analysis of Light Verb Variations As introduced in Section 1, the five or some of the five light verbs sometimes can be interchangeably used in both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin.",
        "This indicates that the interchangeable light verbs share some features.",
        "In other words, it is unlikely that a particular feature is preferred by only one light verb and thus differentiates the verb from the others.",
        "This is also proved in Lin et al. (2014).",
        "For instance, their study finds both Mainland and Taiwan ??",
        "congshi and ?",
        "gao significantly prefer nominal complements (POS.N).",
        "Therefore, to better explore the light verb differences in the two variants, we adopt a multivariate analysis for this study.",
        "The multivariate analysis we used is polytomous logistic regression (Arppe 2008, cf. Han et al. 2013, Bresnan et al. 2007), and the tool we used is the Polytomous() function in the Polytoumous package in R (Arppe 2008).",
        "The polytomous logistic regression is an extension of standard logistic regression; it calculates the odds of the occurrence of a particular light verb when a particular feature is present, with all other features being equal (Arppe, 2008).",
        "In addition, it also allows for simultaneous estimation of the occurrence probability of all the five light verbs.",
        "Before we discuss the light verb variations based on multivariate analysis, we will show that the polytomous multivariate model adopted is reliable for our study.",
        "Table 2 presents the probability estimates of Mainland and Taiwan light verbs calculated by the model.",
        "The results indicate that the overall performance of the model is good: the most frequently predicted light verb (in each column) corresponds to the light verb that actually occurs in the data (in each row) (see the numbers in bold).",
        "In addition, the recall, precision, and F-measure of the estimates given in Table 3 show that each light verb in each variant can be successfully identified with a F-score better than chance (0.2), while the performance varies from light verb to light verb, which is thus consistent with the results in Lin et al. (2014).",
        "The only exception is ?",
        "gao in Mainland Mandarin, but the low F-score of ?",
        "gao (0.14) is consistent with the linguistic observation that this verb is rarely used as a light verb in Mainland Mandarin.",
        "More detailed information of the factors that can distinguish the five light verbs in each 3 variant can also be found in Table 4.",

        "The features in Table 1 could be expanded to 17 binary features.",
        "For example, ASP could be expanded into four binary features: ASP.le, ASP.zhe, ASP.guo, ASP.none.",
        "Each instance of a light verb in the corpus was represented by a vector with 17 dimensions.",
        "Each dimension stores the value of one of the 17 binary features determined by the context where the light verb is used.",
        "6 Cluster ID 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 congshi TW 39 43 1 84 2 21 4 4 1 1 ML 62 48 0 83 1 4 1 1 0 0 gao TW 38 141 0 0 9 10 2 0 4 0 ML 88 64 3 8 11 5 10 4 6 4 jiayi TW 152 0 6 28 11 2 0 4 0 0 ML 117 3 6 62 18 2 5 14 1 1 jinxing TW 26 79 7 2 38 30 0 3 15 1 ML 23 80 16 0 55 22 5 2 1 0 zuo TW 20 3 0 2 23 130 20 2 1 6 ML 23 44 3 16 38 45 20 11 8 3 Table 5: The distribution of data origin by the clustering result.",
        "Then we adopt a clustering algorithm K-Means to identify the variations of light verbs in Taiwan and Mainland Mandarin.",
        "The assumption is that the instances of a light verb will form different clusters in the hyperspace according to the distances among them.",
        "Each cluster reflects a special use of a light verb.",
        "For example, there could be one cluster, where all the instances take non-accomplishment event argument, e.g., ????/??/??",
        "jiayi fenxi/ yanjiu/ pinglun inflict analyze/ research/ comment ?to analyze/ research/ comment?, etc.",
        "In this sense, if there are light verb variations between Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin, the light verbs will be distributed to two clusters, one with data mainly from Mainland Mandarin, whereas the other mainly from Taiwan Mandarin.",
        "Meanwhile, if a cluster contains much more data from one variant than the other, it indicates the usage of a light verb is mainly restricted to the variant with more data; or if a cluster contains data of similar amount from both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin, it indicates that the two variants share common usages regarding the light verbs.",
        "Therefore, for each light verb, all 400 examples from both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin are mixed together for the analysis.",
        "As the K-Means algorithm requires an input of the number N of the clusters, the selection of N is then an issue we need to consider.",
        "Remembering that the clusters reflect the use of a light verb rather than data origin, the selection of N should be based on the consideration of how many different uses a light verb may have.",
        "As there are 17 expanded binary features, the whole space of the values of the vectors is 217 = 128K.",
        "However, the number of different uses for a light verb should not be too large.",
        "There is no problem if N is set slightly larger than the real number of different uses of a light verb.",
        "For example, if there are 5 different uses for a light verb and we set N=6, then we can imagine that there may be two clusters that reflect the same use of the light verb.",
        "On the contrary, if N is set too small, all different uses will be mixed together.",
        "Then, the clustering result may not be able to show any interesting result we expected.",
        "In our experiments, we set N=10 for all the five light verbs.",

        "The fact that newly emergent variants differ from each other comparatively rather than contrastively may also have important linguistics implications.",
        "In addition, by successfully differentiating these two variants based on their uses of light verbs, the result also suggests that variations among such newly emergent variants may arise from categories that are semantically highly bleached and tend to be/or have been grammaticalized.",
        "Computationally, the ability of machine learning approaches to differentiate Mainland and Taiwan variants of Mandarin Chinese potentially contributes to overcoming the challenge of automatic identification of subtle language/dialect variations among other light verbs, other lexical categories, as well as other languages/dialects.",
