        "The standard form of written Arabic is Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) .",
        "It differs significantly from various spoken varieties of Arabic (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2011; Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2014; Elfardy and Diab, 2013).",
        "Even though these dialects do not originally exist in written form, they are present in social media texts.",
        "Recently a dataset of dialectal Arabic has been made available in the form of the Arabic Online Commentary (AOC) set (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2011; Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2014).",
        "The data consists of reader commentary from the online versions of Arabic newspapers, which have a high degree of dialect content.",
        "Data for the following dialects has been collected: Levan-tine, Gulf, and Egyptian.",
        "The data had been obtained by a crowd-sourcing effort.",
        "In the current paper, we present results for a binary classification task only, where we predict the dialect of Egyptian Arabic ARZ vs. MSA sentences from the Al-Youm Al-Sabe?",
        "newspaper online commentaries 1 .",
        "Our ultimate goal is to use the dialect classifier for building a dialect-aware Arabic-English statistical machine translation (SMT) system.",
        "Our Arabic-English training data contains a significant amount of Egyptian dialect data only, and we would like to adapt the components of our hierarchical phrase-based SMT system (Zhao and Al-Onaizan, 2008) to that data.",
        "Similar to (Elfardy and Diab, 2013), we present a sentence-level classifier that is trained in a supervised manner.",
        "Our approach is based on an Arabic tokenizer, but we do not use a range of specialized tokenizers or orthography normalizers.",
        "In contrast to the language-model (LM) based classifier used by (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2014), we present a linear classifier approach that works best without the use of LM-based features.",
        "Some improvements in terms of classification accuracy and 10-fold cross validation under the same data conditions as (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2011; Elfardy and Diab, 2013) are presented.",
        "In general, we aim at a smaller amount of domain specific feature engineering than previous related approaches.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we present related work on language and dialect identification.",
        "In Section 3, we discuss the linear classification model used in this paper.",
        "In Section 4, we evaluate the classifier performance in terms of classification accuracy on two data sets and present some ?",
        "Part of the work was done while the author was a student intern at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center.",
        "1 We use the ISO 639-3 code ARZ for denoting Egyptian Arabic.",
        "110 error analysis.",
        "Finally, in Section 5, we discuss future work on improved dialect-level classification and its application to system adaptation for machine translation.",
        "2 Related Work From a computational perpective, we can view dialect identification as a more fine-grained form of language identification (ID).",
        "Previous work on language ID examined the use of character histograms (Cav- nar and Trenkle, 1994; Dunning, 1994), and high accuracy prediction results have been reported even for languages with a common character set.",
        "(Baldwin and Lui, 2010) present a range of document-level language identification techniques on three different data sets.",
        "They use n-gram counting techniques and different tokenization schemes that are adopted to those data sets.",
        "Their classification task deals with several languages, and it becomes more difficult as the number of languages increases.",
        "They present an SVM-based multiclass classification approach similar to the one presented in this paper which performs well on one of their data sets.",
        "(Trieschnigg et al., 2012) generates n-gram features based on character or word sequences to classify dialectal documents in a dutch-language fairy-tale collection.",
        "Their baseline model uses N -gram based text classification techniques as popularised in the TextCat tool (Cavnar and Trenkle, 1994).",
        "Following (Baldwin and Lui, 2010), the authors extend the usage of n-gram features with nearest neighbour and nearest-prototype models together with appropriately chosen similarity metrics.",
        "(Zampieri and Gebre, 2012) classify two varieties of the same language: European and Brazilian Portuguese.",
        "They use word and character-based language model classification techniques similar to (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2014).",
        "(Huang and Lee, 2008) present simple bag-of-word techniques to classify varieties of Chinese from the Chinese Gigaword corpus.",
        "(Kruengkrai et al., 2005) extend the use of n-gram features to using string kernels: they may take into account all possible sub-strings for comparison purposes.",
        "The resulting kernel-based classifier is compared against the method in (Cavnar and Trenkle, 1994).",
        "(Lui and Cook, 2013) present a dialect classification approach to identify Australian, British, and Canadian English.",
        "They present results where they draw training and test data from different sources.",
        "The successful transfer of models from one text source to another is evidence that their classifier indeed captures dialectal rather than stylistic or formal differences.",
        "Language identification of related languages is also addressed in the DSL (Discriminating Similar Languages) task of the present Vardial workshop at COLING 14 (Tan et al., 2014).",
        "While most of the above work focuses on document-level language classification, recent work on handling Arabic dialect data addresses the problem of sentence-level classification (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2011; Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2014; Elfardy and Diab, 2013; Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2014).",
        "The work is based on the data collection effort by (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2014) which crowdsources the annotation task to workers on Amazons Mechanical Turk.",
        "The classification results by (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2014) are based on n-gram language-models, where the n-grams are defined both on words and characters.",
        "The authors find that unigram word-based models perform best.",
        "The word-based models are obtained after a minimal amount of preprocessing such as proper handling of HTML entities and Arabic numbers.",
        "Classification accuracy is significantly reduced for shorter sentences.",
        "(Elfardy and Diab, 2013) presents classifcation result based on various tokinization and orthographic normalization techniques as well as so-called meta features that estimate the informalness of the data.",
        "Like our work, the authors focus on a binary dialect classification based on the ARZ-MSA portion of the dataset in (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2011).",

        "We focus on the binary classification between MSA and ARZ.",
        "Details on the data sources can be found in Table 1.",
        "We present accuracy results in terms of 10-fold stratified cross-validation which are comparable to previously published work.",
        "3.1 Tokenization and Dictionaries The Arabic tokenizer used in the current paper is based on (Lee et al., 2003).",
        "It is a general purpose tokenizer which has been optimized towards improving machine translation quality of SMT systems rather than dialect classification.",
        "Together with the tokenized text, a maximum-entropy based tagger provides the part-of-speech (PoS) tags for each token.",
        "In addition, we have explored a range of features that are based on the output of the AIDA software package (Elfardy and Diab, 2012; Mona Diab et al., 2009 2011).",
        "The AIDA software has been made available to the participants of the DARPA-funded Broad Operational Language Translation (BOLT) project.",
        "AIDA is a system for dialect identification, classification and glossing on the token and sentence level for written Arabic.",
        "AIDA aggregates several components including dictionaries and language models in order to perform named entity recognition, dialect identification classification, and MSA English linearized glossing of the input text.",
        "We created a dictionary from AIDA resources that includes about 41 000 ARZ tokens.",
        "In addition, we obtained a second small dictionary of about 70 ARZ dialect tokens with the help of a native speaker of Arabic.",
        "The list was created by training two IBM Model 1 lexicons, one on Egyptian Arabic data and another on MSA data.",
        "We then inspected the ARZ lexicon entries with the highest cosine distance to their MSA counterparts and kept the ones that are strong ARZ words.",
        "The tokens in both dictionaries are not ARZ exclusive, but could occur in MSA as well.",
        "3.2 Feature Set In our work, we employ a simple set of binary feature functions based on the tokenized Arabic sentence.",
        "For example, we define a token bigram feature as follows: ?",
        "Bi (t k , t k?1 ) = { 1 t k = ??",
        "?",
        "\u0010 ??",
        "and t k?1 = ???g?",
        "0 otherwise .",
        "(3) 112 Token unigram and trigram features are defined accordingly.",
        "We also define unigram, bigram, and trigram features based on PoS tags.",
        "Currently, just PoS unigrams are used in the experiments.",
        "We define dictionary-based features as follows: ?",
        "Dict l (t k ) = { 1 t k = ?",
        "\u0010 I \u0010 ???X?",
        "and t k ?",
        "Dict l 0 otherwise , (4) where we use the two dictionaries Dict 1 and Dict 2 as described in Section 3.1.",
        "The dictionaries are handled as token sets and we generate separate features for each of them.",
        "We generate some features based on the AIDA tool output.",
        "AIDA provides a dialect label for each input token t k as well as a single dialect label at the sentence level.",
        "A sentence-level binary feature based on the AIDA sentence level classification is defined as follows: ?",
        "AIDA (t n 1 ) = { 1 AIDA(t n 1 ) is ARZ 0 otherwise (5) where AIDA(t n 1 ) is the sentence-level classification of the AIDA tool.",
        "A word-level feature ?",
        "AIDA (t k ) is defined accordingly.",
        "These features improve the classification accuracy of our best system significantly.",
        "We have also experimented with some real-valued feature.",
        "For example, we derived a feature from dialect-specific language model probabilities: ?",
        "LM (t n 1 ) = 1/n ?",
        "[ log(p MSA (t n 1 )) ?",
        "log(p ARZ (t n 1 ))] , where log(p ARZ (t n 1 )) is the language-model log probability for the dialect class ARZ .",
        "We used a trigram language model.",
        "p MSA (?)",
        "is defined accordingly.",
        "In addition, we have implemented a range of so-called ?meta?",
        "features similar to the ones defined in (Elfardy and Diab, 2013).",
        "For example, we define a feature ?",
        "Excl (t n 1 ) which is equal to the length of the longest consecutive sequence of exclamation marks in the tokenized sentence t n 1 .",
        "Similarly, we define features that count the longest sequence of punctuation marks, the number of tokens, the averaged character-length of a token in the sentence, and the percentage of words with word-lengthening effects.",
        "These features do not directly model dialectalness of the data but rather try to capture the degree of in-formalness.",
        "Contrary to (Elfardy and Diab, 2013) we find that those features do not improve accuracy of our best model in the cross-validation experiments.",
        "On the DEV12 set, the use of the meta features results in a significant drop in accuracy.",
        "4 Experiments In this section, we present experimental results.",
        "Firstly, Section 4.1 demonstrates that our data is annotated consistently.",
        "In Section 4.2, we present dialect prediction results in terms of accuracy and F-score on our two data sets.",
        "In Section 4.3, we perform some qualitative error analysis for our classifier.",
        "In Section 4.4, we present some preliminary effects on training a SMT system.",
        "4.1 Annotator Agreement To confirm the consistent annotation of our data, we have measured some inter-annotator and intra-annotator agreement on it.",
        "A native speaker of Arabic was asked to classify the ARZ-MSA portion of the dialect data using the following three labels: ARZ, MSA, Other.",
        "We randomly sampled 250 sentences from the ARZ-MSA portion of the Zaidan data maintaining the original dialect distribution.",
        "The confusion matrix is shown in Table 2.",
        "It corresponds to a kappa value of 0.84 (using the definition of (Fleiss, 1971)), which indicates a very high agreement.",
        "In addition, we did re-annotate a sub-set of 200 sentences from the DEV12 set over a time period of three months using our own annotator.",
        "The kappa value of the corresponding confusion matrix is 0.93, indicating very high agreement as well.",
        "4.2 Classification Experiments Following previous work, we present dialect prediction results in terms of accuracy: ACC = # sent correctly tagged # sent , (6) 113 Predicted Class (IBM) ARZ MSA Other Actual ARZ 125 4 1 Class MSA 14 105 1 (AOC) Other 0 0 0 Table 2: Inter annotator agreement on 250 randomly selected AOC sentences from the data in Table 1.",
        "An in-lab annotator's dialect prediction is compared against the AOC data gold-standard dialect labels.",
        "where ?# sent?",
        "is the number of sentences.",
        "In addition, we present dialect prediction results in terms of precision, recall, and F-score.",

        "Prec ?Recall (Prec+Recall) .",
        "MSA prediction F-score is defined analogously.",
        "Experimental results are presented in Table 3, where we present results for different sets of feature types and the two test sets in Table 1.",
        "In the top half of the table, results are presented in terms of 10-fold cross validation on the ARZ-MSA portion of the AOC data.",
        "In the bottom half, we present results on DEV12 tune set, where we use the entire dialect data in Table 1 for training (about 26K sentences).",
        "As our baseline we have re-implemented the language-model-perplexity based approach reported in (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2011).",
        "We train language models on the dialect-labeled commentary training data for each of the dialect classes c ?",
        "{MSA,ARZ}.",
        "During testing, we compute the language model probability of a sentence s for each of the classes c. We assign a sentence to the class c with the highest probability (or the lowest perplexity) .",
        "For the 10-fold cross validation experiments, 10 language models are built and perplexities are computed on 10 different test sets.",
        "The resulting (averaged) accuracy is 83.3 % for cross-validation and 82.2 % on the DEV12 tune set.",
        "In comparison, (Elfardy and Diab, 2013) reports an accuracy of 80.4 % as perplexity-based baseline.",
        "We have carried out additional experiments with a simple feature set that consists of only unigram token and bigram token features as defined in Eq. 3.",
        "Such a system performs surprisingly well under both testing conditions: we achieved an accuracy of 87.7 % on the AOC data and an accuracy of 83.4 % on the DEV12 test set.",
        "On the AOC set using 10-fold cross validation, we achieve only a small improvement from using the dictionary features defined in Eq. 4.",
        "The accuracy is improved from 87.7 % to 88.0 %.",
        "On the DEV12 set, we obtain a much larger improvement from using these features.",
        "Furthermore, we have investigated the usefulness of the AIDA-based features.",
        "The stand-alone sentence-level classification of the AIDA tool performs quite poorly.",
        "On the DEV12 set, it achieves an accuracy of just 77.9 %.",
        "But using the AIDA assigned sentence-level and token-level dialect labels based on the binary features defined in Eq. 5 improves accuracy significantly, e.g. from 85.3 % to 87.8 % on the DEV12 set.",
        "In the current experiments, the so-called meta features which are computed at the sentence level do not improve classification accuracy.",
        "The meta features are only useful in classifying dialect data based on the in-formalness of the data, i.e. the ARZ news commentaries tend to exhibit more in-formalness than the MSA commentaries.",
        "Finally, the sentence-level perplexity feature defined in Eq. 6 did not improve accuracy as well (no results for this feature are presented in Table 3).",
        "4.3 Classifier Analysis In this section, we perform a simple error analysis of the classifier performance on some dialect data for which the degree of dialectalness is known.",

        "Or, we will be adopting an SMT system to a development or test set where we use the classifier to predict the dialect for each sentence and use a dialect-specific SMT system on each of them individually.",
        "Our approach of using just binary feature functions in connection with a sentence-level global linear model can be related to work on PoS-tagging (Collins, 2002).",
        "(Collins, 2002) trains a linear model based on Viterbi decoding and the perceptron algorithm.",
        "The gold-standard PoS tags are given at the word-level, but the training uses a global representation at the sentence level.",
        "Similarly, we use linear SVMs (Hsieh et al., 2008) to train a classification model at the sentence level without access to sentence length statistics, i.e. our best performing classifier does not compute features like the percentage of punctuation, numbers, or averaged word length as has been proposed previously (Elfardy and Diab, 2013).",
        "All of our features are actually computed at the token level (with the exception of a single sentence-level AIDA-based feature).",
        "An interesting direction for future work could be to train the dialect classifier at the sentence level, but use it to compute token-level predictions for a more fine-grained analysis.",
        "Even though the token-level prediction task corresponds to a word-level tag set of just size 2, Viterbi decoding techniques could be used to introduce novel context-dependent features, e.g. dialect tag n-gram features.",
        "Such a token-level predictions might be used for weighting each phrase pair in an SMT system using methods like the instance-based adaptation approach in (Foster et al., 2010).",
