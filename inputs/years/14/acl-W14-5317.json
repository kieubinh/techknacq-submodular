        "Language identification constitutes the first stage of many NLP pipelines.",
        "Before applying tools trained on specific languages, one must determine the language of the text.",
        "It is also is often considered to be a solved task because of the high accuracy of language identification methods in the canonical formulation of the problem with long monolingual documents and a set of mostly dissimilar languages to choose from.",
        "We consider a different setting with much shorter text in the form of single sentences drawn from very similar languages or dialects.",
        "This paper describes experiments related to and our submissions to the Discriminating Similar Languages (DSL) shared task.",
        "This shared task has six subtasks, each a classification task in which a sentence must be labeled as belonging to a small set of related languages: ?",
        "Task A: Bosnian vs. Croatian vs. Serbian ?",
        "Task B: Indonesian vs. Malay ?",
        "Task C: Czech vs. Slovak ?",
        "Task D: Brazilian vs. European Portuguese ?",
        "Task E: Argentinian vs. Peninsular Spanish ?",
        "Task F: American vs. British English The first three tasks involve classes that could be rightly called separate languages or dialects.",
        "The classes of each of the final three tasks have high mutual intelligibility and are so similar that some linguists may not even classify them as separate dialects.",
        "We will use the term ?language variant?",
        "to refer to such classes.",
        "In this paper we experiment with several types of methods aimed at improving the classification accuracy of these tasks: machine learning methods, data pre-processing, feature selection, and additional training data.",
        "We find that a simple na?",
        "?ve Bayes classifier using character and word n-gram features is a strong baseline that is difficult to improve on.",
        "Because this paper covers so many different types of methods, its format eschews the standard ?Results?",
        "section, instead providing comparisons of methods as they are presented.",
        "146 2 Related Work Recent directions in language identification have included finer-grained language identification (King and Abney, 2013; Nguyen and Dogruoz, 2013; Lui et al., 2014), language identification for microblogs (Bergsma et al., 2012; Carter et al., 2013), and the task of this paper, language identification for closely related languages.",
        "Language identification for closely related languages has been considered by several researchers, though it has lacked a systematic evaluation before the DSL shared task.",
        "The problem of distinguishing Croatian from Serbian and Slovenian is explored by Ljube?si?c et al. (2007), who used a list of most frequent words along with a Markov model and a word blacklist, a list of words that are not allowed to appear in a certain language.",
        "A similar approach was later used by Tiedemann and Ljube?si?c (2012) to distinguish Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian.",
        "They further develop the idea of a blacklist classifier, loosening the binary restriction of the earlier work's blacklist and considering the frequencies of words rather than their absolute counts.",
        "This blacklist classifier is able to outperform a na?",
        "?ve Bayes classifier with large amounts of training data.",
        "They also find training on parallel data to be important, as it allows the machine learning methods to pick out features relating to the differences between the languages themselves, rather than learning differences in domain.",
        "Zampieri et al. consider classes that would be most often classified as language varieties rather than separate languages or dialects (Zampieri et al., 2012; Zampieri and Gebrekidan, 2012; Zampieri et al., 2013).",
        "A similar problem of distinguishing among Chinese text from mainland China, Singapore, and Taiwan is considered by Huang and Lee (2008) who approach the problem by computing similarity between a document and a corpus according to the size of the intersection between the sets of types in each.",
        "A similar, but somewhat different problem of automatically identifying lexical variants between closely related languages is considered in (Peirsman et al., 2010).",
        "Using distributional methods, they are able to identify Netherlandic Dutch synonyms for words from Belgian Dutch.",
        "3 Data This paper's training data and evaluation data both come from the DSL corpus collection (DSLCC) (Tan et al., 2014).",
        "We use the training section of this data for training and the development section for evaluation.",
        "The training section consists of 18,000 labeled instances per class, while the development section has 2,000 labeled instances per class.",
        "In order to try to increase classifier accuracy (and to avoid the problems with the task F training data), we decided to collect additional training data for each open-class task.",
        "For each task, we collected newspaper text from the appropriate websites for each of the 2?3 languages.",
        "We used regular expressions to split the text into sentences, and created a set of rules to filter out strings that were unlikely to be good sentences.",
        "Because the pages on the newspaper websites tended to have some boilerplate text, we collated all the sentences and only kept one copy of each sentence.",

        "Further evidence of domain overfitting comes from the fact that the larger training sets drawn from newspaper text were not able to improve performance on the development set over the provided training data, which is presumably drawn from the same collection as the development data.",
        "Figure 1 shows learning curves for each of the six tasks.",
        "Though all the external text is self-consistent (cross-validation results in high accuracy), in none of the cases does training on a large amount of external data allow the classifier to exceed the accuracy achieved by training on the DSL data.",
        "6 Conclusion In this paper we experimented with several methods for classification of sentences in closely-related languages for the DSL shared task.",
        "Our analysis showed that, when dealing with closely related languages, the task of classifying text according to its language was difficult to untie from the taks of classifying other text characteristics, such as the domain.",
        "Across all our types of methods, we found that a na?",
        "?ve Bayes classifier using character n-gram, word unigram, and word bigram features was a strong baseline.",
        "In future work, we would like to try to improve on these results by incorporating features that try to capture syntactic relationships.",
        "Certainly some of the pairs of languages considered here are close enough that they could be chunked, tagged, or parsed before knowing exactly which variety they belong to.",
        "This would allow for the inclusion of features related to transitivity, agreement, complementation, etc.",
        "For example, in British English, the verb ?provide?",
        "is monotransitive, but ditransitive in American English.",
        "It is unclear how much features like these would improve accuracy, but it is likely that they would ultimately be necessary to improve classification of similar languages to human levels of performance.",
