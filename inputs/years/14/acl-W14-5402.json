        "Our research addresses a paradoxical situation in developing a robot capable of teaming with humans.",
        "To know what capabilities such a robot needs, we seek to determine how a human commander would interact ?",
        "choice of vocabulary and sentence types, expected capabilities and world knowledge, resources used to accomplish tasks efficiently, etc.",
        "But without such a robot to interact with, we cannot know how a commander would behave.",
        "The prospect of human commanders teaming with mobile robots that are ?smart enough?",
        "to undertake joint exploratory tasks requires novel methods of preparing and testing actual human-robot teams for these ventures, in advance of actual real-time operations.",
        "Furthermore, given the need for human/robot teams during emergencies (such as Japan's tsunami/Fukishima disaster), we are interested in particular in the feasibility of commander/robot shared tasks that include NL communication specifically for network contexts when bandwidth is limited by emergencies.",
        "Here we ask, how can multimodal data, as collected and processed by robots, and the robots themselves contribute real-time alerts and responses to human commanders over geographically-distributed networks?",
        "The first phase of our approach is to introduce a human stand-in who navigates the robot, posing as an intelligent control system.",
        "At this stage, following our prior work (Voss et al., 2014), we seek to determine how the commander communicates to accomplish different tasks with the robot, while we limit the information made available in passing from the robot's sensors and camera to the commander by way of the stand-in.",
        "In future phases, we will progressively automate away this actor's role, replacing the audio that the stand-in hears with what is ?understood?",
        "by automatic natural language semantic interpretation within a dialog manager, and replacing the joystick that it uses to navigate as the robot This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "9 with ?actions?",
        "as automatically generated from micro-controller commands produced by transformation of semantic commands.",
        "In this paper, we report work-in-progress that maintains face validity of selected configurations of resources and people, as would be available in emergency circumstances.",
        "From an off-site post, we ask human commanders (C) to perform an exploratory task in collaboration with a remotely located human robot-navigator (Rn) who actually controls the navigation of, but cannot see, the physical robot (R).",
        "We restrict the information Rn receives from R by imposing network bandwidth restrictions comparable to real circumstances which limit what Rn is able to communicate to C. We then examine the comman-der/robot dialogs and task performance under these varied conditions.",
        "To better understand the capabilities and language required in such configurations, we constructed multi-modal corpora of time-synced dialog, video, and LIDAR files recorded during task sessions.",
        "We can now examine commander/robot dialogs while replaying what C and Rn saw, to identify the impact of varying the shared visual information on discourse, and to assess task performance under these varied conditions.",
        "We hypothesized that more explicit, mututally available information (visual or verbal) between participants would yield better understanding with more common ground, leading to more task success.",
        "We also hypothesized that exploration in a more complex physical environment would lead both to more dialog, as needed in resolving references to more locations, and also then on occasion, to less overall task success.",
        "We have found in preliminary analyses that, with more explicit visual information, some Cs reduce their level of communication, with fewer requests for images from Rn.",
        "In one such case, this led to the Rn getting lost.",
        "We also noticed that some Cs increased their level of verbal communica-tion, requesting far more still images from the robot when Rn could not itself see the robot's images (as opposed to when Rn had access to sent images).",
        "Taken together, these observations suggest?contrary to our hypothesis that more information is better, especially in a complex environment?that there may be a ?teeter totter?",
        "effect in the communication between C and Rn as visual information varies.",
        "When Rn has access to more of the robot's visual information, C communicates less with Rn, possibly assuming more shared information than is correct.",
        "Whereas when Rn is able to see less, C communicates more with Rn, possibly compensating for the lack of certainty Rn expresses.",
        "2 Related Work For human-robot communication in joint exploration tasks, we wish to understand two issues.",
        "The first is ?scene to text?",
        ": when exploring new locations, how do people talk about what they see, and how does that inform how they want robot team members to communicate about what they ?see?",
        "while exploring?",
        "The second is ?text to scene?",
        ": given natural language instructions, how do people move about in new locations, and how does that impact their expectations of robot navigation?",
        "These issues span both generation and understanding of spatial language.",
        "There exists a large literature on spatial language, starting several decades ago (Talmy, 1983; Anderson et al., 1991; Gurney et al., 1996; Bloom et al., 1996; Olivier and Gapp, 1998) inter alia.",
        "This work yielded linguistic insights into the underlying structure of spatial expressions, that has led more recently to annotation efforts like SpaceML (Morarescu, 2006) and spatial role labeling (Kordjamshidi et al., 2010).",
        "These results, theoretical and computational, have been incorporated into NLP research, such as spoken dialog systems (Meena et al., 2014).",
        "For ?scene to text?",
        "processing, starting from a robot's perception of the scene or environment, exploiting even known dependencies among objects (spatial relations, relative motion, etc.)",
        "is a central problem in computer vision research.",
        "In the current state of robotics, the perceived world (a.k.a.",
        "semantic perception) derived from data collected by the robot is limited by what is available within its immediate sensor and video reach (Hebert et al., 2012).",
        "Within computational linguistic research, (Feng and Lapata, 2013) have tackled going from news images to text, leveraging the news story content as contextual knowledge, and automatically generating captions describing the image content as relevant for the story.",
        "For ?text to scene?",
        "processing, a robot ?understanding?",
        "a commander's language entails going beyond linguistic semantic interpretation down to the the robot controller level, as in, for example, Kress-Gazit et al. (2008).",
        "Within computational linguistics, Srihari and Burhans (1994) tackled going from text to images, exploiting the conventions and spatial language in news caption to identify people 10 by their relative positions in accompanying images.",
        "More recently Coyne et al. (2011) presented work for text-to-graphics generation, grounding conceptual knowledge in relational semantic encoding of lexical meanings from FrameNet.",
        "These one-way, directional approaches provide strong evidence that text and image modalities can each inform the processing of the other, and that, with concurrent audio and video streaming data, the alignment of time-stamped files across the two data modalities should also yield additional benefits in shared structural analyses and disambiguating references.",
        "1 3 Approach In previous work, we had teams search a series of buildings, where all information from the Rn to C was strictly limited to text (Voss et al., 2014).",
        "While verbal descriptions of scenery were successfully elicited during exploratory missions, the communication was painfully slow and this scenario yielded unrealistic results from our stand-in: we would not expect a robot to generate the complex verbal descriptions we collected.",
        "Furthermore we also learned that our equipment could be adjusted for transmission of LIDAR map data and video stream from the robot to Rn and then to C. In this second study, we allowed individual map and image updates to be sent to C, but only on request.",
        "This work provides more explicitly shared knowledge between C and Rn, with its form and quantity more realistically varied and dynamic.",
        "Equipment: We used an iRobot PackBot equipped with a forward-facing Kinect camera and a Hokuyo LIDAR sensor.",
        "2 We use GPS and inertial sensors for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).",
        "Each participant had their own laptop with speakers and separate push-to-talk microphones.",
        "For navigating the robot, the Rn pushed a joystick on an X-box controller that was held.",
        "Additionally for transmitting visual information available from the robot during the missions, the Rn pushed separate buttons on the same controller to transfer image and map data to C, but only at C's request.",
        "Pre-pilot Design: We conducted training sessions at one location and test sessions at a second location.",
        "A top down view of these sites is provided in Figure 1.",
        "We asked participants to perform distinct missions (task conditions) in the training and test sessions, with different levels of visual information available to Rn (vision conditions).",
        "Due to wireless networking timeouts and hardware integration diffi-culties, a number of sessions ended prematurely.",

        "On the map during training, the Rn could also see (ii) an avatar shape for the robot's location based on GPS and (iii) an arrow for the robot's facing direction generated by its internal components (updated intermittently by GPS).",
        "However the GPS signal was also sporadic during these sessions, causing confusion for Rn navigating the robot.",
        "As a result, during test sessions, we turned off the GPS to avoid this source of confusion, mirroring what actual operators do in this scenario.",
        "During test sessions, the Rn only saw (iii) the arrow, again within (i) the streamed LIDAR map.",

        "Note that in Rn's more-blinded condition, images were passed to C with Rn's button push, but Rn could not see the images.",
        "Mission 1: Enter courtyard and building via safe doorways.",
        "We hypothesized a robot with the ability to carry on limited conversation regarding simple navigation and exploration, but without sufficient vision capabilities to analyze more subtle clues about whether a doorway was safe to enter.",
        "We designed the task to simulate a low-bandwidth condition where constant transmission of the map and video information is impossible.",
        "The robot was placed in one of two undisclosed positions outside the courtyard surrounding a building.",
        "All sessions adopted the L+I+V vision condition.",
        "The site for this mission was a Figure 2: Robot-navigator's screen during Mission 1: upper left is static Image (clip from video, most recently sent to Commander), upper right is video window, gray-scale background is LIDAR map 12 single rectangular building enclosed by a single rectangular courtyard.",
        "The site for mission 2 was more complex, consisting of 5 buildings in a complex series of interconnected courtyards (see Figure 1).",
        "There are five doorways into the courtyard and two doorways into the building.",
        "These doorways are marked as safe or unsafe in a way that C can recognize but Rn cannot (C is given a key to the meaning of objects placed just beyond open doorways as symbols).",

        "C's view is similar, but without video.",
        "Success on this task was gauged by whether the robot stayed safe in gaining entry to the house.",
        "Mission 2: Find and classify all building doorways within a compound.",
        "As noted above and shown in Figure 1, the location in this mission had a more complex layout.",
        "The robot's location within the compound was not disclosed to C nor Rn (no clues were provided), so that the C and Rn team would need to work hard to place the robot on the map.",
        "The team was tasked with thoroughly exploring the compound to capture images of each building doorway.",
        "In the LIDAR-only (L) condition, Rn sees only the grey-scale map, whereas in the LIDAR and image condition (L+I) Rn sees the most recently sent image as well as the grey-scale map (same screen layout as in Figure 2 but without video window in upper right).",
        "Success on this mission was gauged both by the number of doors (open or closed) that were identified and photographed and by whether the participants were lost at some stage in the exploration.",
        "4 Observations and Preliminary Results We recorded rich, multi-modal datasets including: dialogue between C and Rn, video, LIDAR 3D point clouds, scene classification output on video frames, and robot pose.",

        "or ?doorways,?",
        "although by a dictionary definition, those refer to somewhat different things.",
        "Based on context, the robot would need to be able to understand which sense was intended.",
        "14 Spatial Relations: Since these were navigation and observation tasks, much of the discussion involved spatial language pertaining to object configurations and robot paths.",
        "There were references to distances and angles, both specific (?turn 15 degrees to your right?)",
        "and vague (?turn around.?)",
        "The robot was asked to ?follow the wall?, ?go north?, and to travel ?around,?",
        "?behind,?",
        "and ?near?",
        "various objects.",
        "Clarifications and Suggestions in Dialogs: When uncertain about the meaning of commands, Rn sometimes asked for clarification.",
        "At other times, Rn reminded C of its capabilities when appropriate: ?Would you like me to send you an updated map??",
        "4.3 The Role of Shared Visual Information Participants were generally able to use both image and map data in conjunction with dialog to gain enough common ground to communicate about the environment and accomplish the tasks at hand.",
        "For example, after discussing environment features against the backdrop of an updated 2D map, we were often surprised at the extent to which C apparently kept track of R's location using dialog alone without further map updates, as evidenced by C's ability to correctly use Rn's egocentric frame of reference in verbal descriptions (recall that the robot avatar remained static on C's map between updates).",
        "In such cases C and R took advantage of mutually accessible visual information their 2D maps were identical during discussion.",
        "The role of mutually accessible information for achieiving common ground is further supported by the fact that C requested significantly more images in the LIDAR-only condition, when Rn could not see those sent images (see Table 3).",
        "Although shared visual knowledge proved useful for resolving referring expressions, C and Rn rarely mentioned the media explicitly (?the building?",
        "vs ?the building in the image you sent me?).",
        "In this way, the transfer of visual information served to introduce entities into their discourse, but was taken for granted and not called out per se.",
        "5 Ongoing Work We have found in preliminary analyses that, with more explicit visual information, some Cs reduce their level of communication, with fewer requests for images from Rn.",
        "In one such case, this led to the Rn getting lost.",
        "We also noticed that some Cs increased their level of verbal communication, requesting far more still images from the robot when Rn could not itself see the robot's images (as opposed to when Rn had access to sent images).",
        "Taken together, these observations suggest?contrary to our hypotheses that more information is better, especially in a complex environment?that there may be a ?teeter totter?",
        "effect in the communication between C and Rn as visual information varies.",
        "When Rn ?sees as the robot?",
        "with access to more transmitted visual information, C communicates less with Rn, possibly assuming more shared information than is correct.",
        "Whereas when Rn ?sees?",
        "less, C communicates more with Rn, possibly compensating for the lack of certainty Rn expresses.",
        "We plan to extend our analysis of how C and Rn communicate uncertainty, and look at how this topic is addressed in first aid and military manuals (US Dept. of the Army, 1993).",
        "We are currently developing a framework to automate many of the tasks currently performed by Rn.",
        "Our studies and data collections so far are best understood in the context of the capabilities and limitations of the overall system we are in the process of building.",
        "A crucial gap to address is associating referring expressions with corresponding concrete spatial structures in the 3D map.",
        "Consider one sentence spoken by the commander in one of the dialogues: ?When you get to the wall, turn left and drive along the wall until you reach either a corner or what you believe to be a door.?",
        "To interpret this correctly, the robot must understand an entire set of points as a single object or part of an object, so it can recognize doors, walls, and corners in the combined vision and point-cloud.",
        "Moreover, it needs to plan a path that obeys the constraint ?along the wall?",
        "and stops at some point which may be a door or a corner, that has not yet been observed.",
        "Thus, objects need to be represented independent of the observed world map.",
        "4 At present, scene parsing techniques can analyze images and assign each pixel a probability of belonging to a particular object class (wall, stucco, road, etc.)",
        "allowing us to propagate these labels to corresponding points in the 3D model of the scene.",
        "In the future, we will use the 3D model to resolve visual ambiguities and attach labels to particular objects that persist from one video frame to the next.",
