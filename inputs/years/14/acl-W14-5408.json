        "Recently, several researches on profile inference of Social Networking Services (SNS) user conducted by analyzing postings have been reported (Rao and Yarowsky, 2010; Han et al., 2013; Makazhanov et al., 2013).",
        "User profile information such as gender, age, residential area, and political preference have attracted attention because they are helpful for marketing, target advertisement, TV viewer rate calcu-lations, and opinion polls.",
        "The major approach to this subject is building a machine learning classifier trained by text in postings.",
        "However, images posted by a user are rarely used in profile inference.",
        "Images in postings also include features of user profiles.",
        "For example, if a user posts many dessert imag-es, then the user might be female.",
        "Therefore, we assumed that highly accurate profile inference will be available by analyzing image information and text information simultaneously.",
        "As described in this paper, we implement gender inference of Japanese Twitter user using text information and image information.",
        "We propose a combined method consisting of text processing and image processing, which accepts tweets as input data and outputs a gender probability score.",
        "The combined method comprises of two steps: step 1) two gender probability scores are inferred respectively by a text processor and an image processor; step 2) the combined score is calculated by merging two gender scores with an appropriate ratio.",
        "This report is the first describing an attempt to apply the combined method of text processing and image processing to profile inference of an SNS user.",
        "This paper is presented as seven sections: section 2 presents a description of prior work; section 3 presents a description of the annotation data prepared for this study; section 4 introduces the proposed method; section 5 explains preliminary experiments for optimizing the combined method parameter; section 6 presents the experimentally obtained result; section 7 summarizes the paper and discusses future work.",
        "2 Prior Work Many reports have described studies examining gender inference.",
        "The conventional approach to this theme is building a machine learning classifier such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained by text features (Burger et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2012).",
        "Most of these studies specifically examine improvement of the machine classification methodology rather than expanding features or combining features.",
        "Different from these studies, Liu et al. (2013) implemented gender inference with incorporation of a user name into the classifier based on text information.",
        "However, the expansion of features This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "License details: http://creativecommons.org/licenses /by/4.0/ 54 remains in the text field.",
        "A few reports in the literature describe studies of systems that infer the SNS user gender with information aside from the text.",
        "Ikeda et al. (2013) leverages the accuracy of profile inference based on a text feature classifier by combining user cluster information.",
        "According to their study, the accuracy of classification that deals only with the user cluster is lower than that of the text classifier.",
        "The classifier using both text and cluster information of a user outperforms their text classifier.",
        "This research shows that information aside from the text is useful to leverage the performance of profile inference based on text and text information is necessary to achieve high accuracy.",
        "However, we introduce image information that is not used by Ikeda et al (2013).",
        "Along with text information and cluster information, images are popular informative elements that are included in SNS postings.",
        "An image includes enough information to infer what is printed in itself, and researches to automatically annotate an image with semantic labels are already known (Zhang et al., 2012).",
        "Automatic image annotation is a machine learning technique that involves a process by which a computer system automatically assigns semantic labels to a digital image.",
        "These studies succeeded in inferences of various objects, such as person, dog, bicycle, chair etc.",
        "We supposed that such objects in images posted by a user should be useful clues as to a profile inference of a twitter user.",
        "As a matter of fact, gender inference by image information is reported by Ma et al. (2014), which implemented gender inference by processing images in tweets.",
        "Their study, which ignored text information, exhibited accuracy of less than 70%.",
        "It was much lower than most gender inference work using text feature.",
        "From results of these studies, we concluded that gender inference by text and image information invites further study.",
        "3 Proposed Method Our proposed method for combining text processing and image processing is presented in Figure 1.",
        "First, data of 200 tweets of a user are separated into text data and image data.",
        "Each of separated data is analyzed using a dedicated processor, a text processor, and an image processor.",
        "Both of the processors Figure 1.",
        "Combined method constitution.",
        "text Gender classifier G nd probability c r of a user Image Combined method Combined gender probability score of a user Text Processor Image Processor Gender probability score of a user Object Classifiers Object probability scores Consolidation of scores Food-male classifiers Food-female classifiers Pet-female classifiers Toy male classifiers Food-male probability score of an image Food-female probability score of an image Toy-male probability score of an image Pet-female probability score of an image 200 tweets posted by a user 55 output a user's gender probability score, the upper/lower ends of which respectively correspond to male and female labels.",
        "At the end of this process, the combined gender probability score is calculated using two probability scores.",
        "In this section, details of the two processors and the method of combining their two results are described.",
        "3.1 Text Processing The text processor is constructed from a text classifier, which accepts text data in tweets and outputs the gender probability score of a user.",
        "We defined the gender classifier in the text processor as an SVM binary classification of a male and female.",
        "The SVM classifier is trained based on unigram Bag-of-words with a linear kernel.",
        "The cost parameter C is set to 1.0.",
        "Then LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2001) is used as an implementation of SVM.",
        "Because words are not divided by spaces in a Japanese sentence, Kuromoji (Atilika, 2011), a morphological analysis program for Japanese, is used to obtain unigrams.",
        "To combine two results from the text processor and the image processor, it is necessary to calculate each result as a probability value.",
        "To retrieve probability scores, we used logistic regression.",
        "Logistic function converts a distance from a hyper plane to probability scores of 0.0?1.0.",
        "The text classifier is a male and female binary classification.",
        "Therefore, the upper and lower ends of the probability score respectively correspond to male and female data.",
        "If a score is close to 0.0, then the user has high probability of being male.",
        "If it is close to 1.0, then a user is probably female.",
        "3.2 Image Processing We first tried to infer a Twitter user gender directly by a two-class classifier trained by image feature vector calculated by all images posted by a user.",
        "However, with some preliminary experiments, we found that this approach does not work well, since the large variation of objects made the classification difficult with single classifier setting.",
        "We, therefore, used the image processing method described by Ma et al. (2014) which uses automatic image annotation classifiers (Zhang et al., 2012) to model human recognition of different gender tendency in images.",
        "The method consists of two steps: step 1) annotating images by an image annotation technique at the image level; step 2) consolidating gender scores according to annotation results at the user level.",
        "In the first step, the image labels are defined as the combination of the following two information: the gender tendency in images of a user and the objects that images express.",
        "Ma et al. (2014) defined 10 categories of objects in SNS images based on observation on a real dataset.",
        "The defined labels are cartoon/illustration, famous person, food, goods, memo/leaflet, outdoor/nature, person, pet, screen-shot/capture, and other.",
        "They also indicated that gender tendency in images are coherent with user gender, and set three gender labels, male, female, and unknown, for each object label.",
        "As a result, 30 labels constructed from object label and gender label (e.g.",
        "?male-person?)",
        "are used in this paper, which is described in section 4.2.",
        "Then a bag-of-features (BOF) model (Tsai, 2012; Chatfield et al., 2011) is applied to accomplish the image annotation task.",
        "We used local descriptors of SIFT (Lowe, 1999) and image features are encoded with a k-mean generated codebook with size of 2000.",
        "We applied LLC (Wang et al., 2010) and SPM (Lazebnik et al., 2006) to generating the final presentation of image features.",
        "Then, the 30 SVM classifiers are trained based on the features of training images: each classifier is trained per image label among one-versus-rest strategy.",
        "The SVM classifier annotates images of a user by computing scores, and logistic function is applied to the outputs of the image classifiers in order to obtain probability scores.",
        "Each of 30 probability scores shows how an image is close to the decision boundary of a particular label.",
        "In the second step, we integrated the 30 scores of labels assigned to images to yield comprehensive scores which imply a user's gender.",
        "Two methods are suggested for the second step.",
        "One is computing the average of all scores output from each classifier for each of the categories of male and female for a user.",
        "The other is computing the mean value of only the highest scores of every image for each of the categories of male and female for a user.",
        "3.3 Combined method of Text Processing and Image Processing To combine two results derived from text processing and image processing, we used the function below.",
        "Scoretext and Scoreimage respectively represent gender probability scores derived from the text pro-56 cessor and the image processor.",
        "In the function, ?",
        "is set as a ratio of the text score and an image score to combine two scores appropriately.",
        "We introduced ?",
        "as a reliability ratio parameter of the scores by the text processor and the scores by the image processor.",

        "???",
        "?????",
        "1imagetextcombined ScoreScoreScore 4 Data We prepared user annotation data and image annotation data that we used as training data and evaluation data.",
        "User annotation data are input data for the text processor, whereas image annotation data are for the image processor.",
        "As it is required to prepare a huge number of annotated data as a training cor-pus, the data is annotated by Yahoo Crowd Sourcing (Yahoo!",
        "Japan, 2013).",
        "Yahoo Crowd Sourcing is a Japanese crowd sourcing service similar to Amazon Mechanical Turk (Amazon, 2005).",
        "Therefore the annotation process aims to obtain annotation based on human recognition rather than to explore truth about users and images of twitter.",
        "4.1 User Annotation Data We first collected Japanese Twitter users according to their streaming tweets.",
        "We ignored heavy users and Twitter bots.",
        "A random sampling of tweets revealed that tweets from heavy users include much information that is not useful for profile inference such as short representations of their actions (e.g. ?Going to bed now?",
        "and ?Just waking up?).",
        "A Twitter bot is also classed as an uninformative user because it is a program that automatically generates tweets.",
        "During data collection, we filtered out those users by setting conditions shown below in Table 1.",
        "Finally, we obtained 3976 Twitter users.",
        "We gathered tweets on each user up to 200.",
        "By executing the processes above, we obtained tweet data of each user corresponding to the user's own 200 tweets.",
        "To obtain gender annotation for this large dataset, we used Yahoo!",
        "Crowd Sourcing.",
        "As shown in Figure 2(a), we set task for every Twitter user: please infer the gender of the user who posted the tweets in the URL below.",
        "In this task, after reading 200 tweets of a user, the gender label of male or female was asked of every Twitter user.",
        "To guarantee quality reliability, annotation tasks for one Twitter user were duplicated 10 times by different workers; then a majority vote of 10 annotations was calculated to obtain a gold label.",
        "As a result of the crowd sourcing tasks, 1733 users were reported as male; 2067 users were reported as female.",
        "There were 176 users whose votes were split equally between male and female.",
        "We re-Table 1.",
        "Filtering conditions used to disqualify heavy users and Twitter bots User Types Definition for N Criteria Twitter bots Number of tweets posted from Twitter clients on PC/mobile by a user N<150 Heavy Number of Friends or followers of a user N>200 Number of Tweets posted in a day by a user N>10 (a) User annotation task (b) Image annotation task Figure 2.",

        "This gender proportion tendency is consistent with those reported from an earlier study showing that Twitter participants are 55% female (Heli and Piskorski, 2009; Burger et al., 2011).",
        "Finally, we obtained gender annotation data of 3800 users.",
        "We divided these data equally between training data and evaluation data: 1900 users for training data and 1900 users for evaluation data.",

        "It is sometimes difficult to infer a gender of a user solely based on one image.",
        "Therefore, unknown is set for Q1.",
        "From those responses we obtained multiple labels for every image, such as ?male-person?.",
        "To avoid influence by poor-quality workers, each image was presented to 10 different workers.",
        "A summation of 10 annotations was executed to obtain gold label data.",
        "5 Preliminary Experiments 5.1 Image Processing We compared two consolidation methods, computing the average of all scores and computing the average of the highest scores for 30 object scores.",

        "Results show that the accuracy of former method is 60.11.",
        "That of the latter is 65.42.",
        "The reason the latter method is superior to the former one is probably attributable to noise reduction effects of ignoring low scores.",
