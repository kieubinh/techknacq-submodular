        "Recent development on web technology ?",
        "especially on fast connection and large-scale storage systems ?",
        "has enabled social and news media to fulfill their jobs more efficiently in time and depth.",
        "However, such development also raises some problems such as overwhelming social media information and distracting news media contents.",
        "In emergent scenarios such as facing an incoming disaster (e.g., Hurricane Irene in 2011 or Sandy in 2012), tweets and news are often repeatedly spread and forwarded in certain circles and contents are often overlapped by each other.",
        "However, browsing these messages and pages is almost unpleasant and inefficient.",
        "Therefore, an automatic summarization on piles of tweets and news is always necessary and welcomed, among which ranking is the most intuitive way to inform the users about the most informative content.",
        "A passive solution is prompting the users to add more key words when typing the search query as most search engines do.",
        "However, without prior knowledge or due to the word limit, it is never trivial for the users to establish a satisfied ranking list for topics which attract more public attention.",
        "Recent changes on some Google Search have integrated image search and adopted some heterogenous content analysis, nevertheless, the connection between image and the keywords are still arbitrarily determined by the users, thus it is still far from optimal.",
        "Active solutions which attempt to summarize information only focused on single data modalities.",
        "For example, Zanzotto et al. (2011) provided a comprehensive comparison about summarization methods for tweets.",
        "Zhao et al. (2011) developed a context-sensitive topical PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) method to extract topical key phrase from Twitter as a way to summarize twitter content.",
        "As a new prospective, Feng and Lapata (2010) used LDA to annotate images, but this does not firmly integrate the information across different data types.",
        "Huang et al. (2012) presented a tweet ranking approach but only focused on single data modality (i.e., text).",
        "Other conventional solutions towards analyzing the relationship or links between the instances have long been proposed and applied, such as PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998)and VisualRank (Jing and Baluja, 2008).",
        "The former is excessively used in heterogeneous networks (i.e., webpages and resources) but they are mainly based on linkage itself.",
        "VisualRank, which is based on PageRank, is a content-based linkage method but is confined with homogeneous networks.",
        "Above all, our goal is to integrate cross-media inference and create the linkage among the information extracted from those heterogenous data.",
        "Our novel Multi-media Information Networks (MiNets) representation initializes our idea about a basic ontology of the ranking system.",
        "The main contribution of this work is to fill in the domain gaps across different network genres and bridge them in a principled method.",
        "In this work, we manage to discover the hidden links or structures between the heterogeneous networks in different genres.",
        "We combine joint inference to resolve information conflicts across multi-genre This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "74 networks.",
        "We can also effectively measure, share and transfer complementary information and knowledge across multi-genre networks using structured correspondence.",
        "The work is presented in sections as follows.",
        "We firstly introduce an overview of our system in Section 2.",
        "Detailed approaches in information extraction and constructing meta-information network are then followed in Section 3.",
        "Measurement across the multimedia information are proposed in Section 4 and 5.",
        "In Section 6 we demonstrate the results and performance gain.",
        "2 Approach Overview Within the context of an event where users generate a vast amount of multi-media messages in forms of tweets and images, we aim to provide a ranked subset of the most informative ones.",
        "Given a set of tweets T = {t 1 , ..., t n }, and a set of images P = {p 1 , ..., p m } as input, our approach provides ordered lists of the most informative tweets or images (a.k.a objects) so that the informativeness of an object in position i is higher than or equal to that of an object in position i + 1.",
        "We consider the degree of informativeness of a certain object as the extent to which it provides valuable information to people who are involved in or tracking the event in question.",
        "During emergent events, there are tight correlations between social media and web documents.",
        "Important information shared in social media tends to be posted in web documents.",
        "Therefore we also integrate information in a formal genre such as web documents to enhance the ranking quality of tweets and images.",
        "It consists of two main sub-tasks: ?",
        "Multimedia Information Network (MiNet) Construction: Construct MiNet from cross-media and cross-genre information (i.e. tweets, images, sentences of web doc-uments).",
        "Given a set of tweets and images on a specific topic as input, the formal genre web documents and images from the embedded URLs in those tweets are retrieved.",
        "Afterwards, a set of sentences and images are extracted from the web documents.",
        "Then we exploit advanced text Information Extraction and image Concept Extraction techniques to extract meta-information and construct the meta-information network.",
        "Together with three sets of heterogeneous input data, MiNet is constructed.",
        "?",
        "MiNet-Based Information Ranking: Rank the tweets and images.",
        "By extending and adapting Tri-HITS (Huang et al., 2012), we propose EN-Tri-HITs, an random walk-based propagation algorithm which iteratively propagate ranking scores for sentences, tweets, and images across MiNet to refine the tweet and image rankings.",
        "3 Meta-information Network When integrating information from different data modalities, meta-information network plays a pivotal role for representing interesting concepts and relations between them.",
        "We automatically construct the initial information networks using our state-of-the-art information extraction and image concept extraction techniques.",
        "A meta-information network is a heterogeneous network including a set of ?information graphs?",
        "which is formally defined as: G = {G i : G i = (V i , E i )}, where V i is the collection of concept nodes, and E i is the collection of edges linking one concept to the other.",
        "An example is depicted in Figure 1.",
        "The meta-information network contains human knowledge pertaining to the target domain that could improve the performance of text process and image analysis.",
        "In this paper, we first construct meta-information networks separately from texts and images, and then fuse and enrich them through effective cross-media linking methods.",
        "3.1 Information Extraction from Texts Extracting salient types of facts for a meta-information network is challenging.",
        "In this paper we tackle this problem from two angles to balance the trade-off between quality and granularity/annotation cost.",
        "On one hand, to reveal deep semantics in meta-information network, we focus on achieving high-quality extraction for pre-defined fine-grained types such as those in NIST Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) 1 .",
        "For example, a ?Person/Individual?",
        "node may include attributes such as ?Birth-Place?, and a ?Organization/Employee?",
        "node may include attributes such as ?City-of-Headquarter?.",
        "These two nodes may be connected via a ?Employment/End-Position?",
        "link.",
        "We apply an Information Extraction (IE) system (Li et al., 2013) to extract entities, relations and events defined in ACE2005.",
        "There are 7 types of entities, 18 types of relations and 33 types of events.",
        "This system is based on a joint framework using structured perceptron with efficient beam-search and incorporating diverse lexical, syntactic, semantic and ontological features.",
        "We convert the IE output into the graph structured representation of meta-information network by mapping each entity as a node, and link entity nodes by semantic relations or events they are involved.",
        "For example, the relations between entities are naturally mapped to links in the meta-information network, such as the ?employment?",
        "relation between ?Bill Read?",
        "and ?Hurricane Center?.",
        "In addition, if an event 1 http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/894.01/tests/ace/ 75 flood Multimedia information Networks Meta-information Networks ORG flooding from Irene killed one person Puerto RicoBill Read Hurricane Center said Employment Speaker Agent Subject Clause Subject PlaceAgent Victim storm Wikipedia Verifiedby wiki Verifiedby wiki Verifiedby wiki Verified Entity Concepts Tweets Sentences of web documents Images Contents Structured information PER GPEEvent TriggerPredicate Predicate Noun phrase Noun phrase Example:SRL IE concept type Conceptfrom image Concept from image Figure 1: An example of meta-information network.",
        "Sentence: ?Bill Read, Hurricane Center director, said that flooding from Irene killed at least one person in Puerto Rico?",
        "argument is an entity, we also add an ?Event Argument?",
        "link between the event trigger and the entity, such as the link between ?Irene?",
        "and ?killed?.",
        "On the other hand, in order to enrich the meta-information network, we extract more coarse-grained salient fact types based on Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) (Pradhan et al., 2008).",
        "For example, given the sentence ?In North Carolina, 10 counties are being evacuated.",
        "?, the ?evacuation?",
        "event is not included in ACE.",
        "However, the SRL system can successfully detect the predicate (?evacuated?)",
        "and its semantic roles (?10 counties?",
        "and ?North Carolina?).",
        "These argument heads and predicates are added into the meta-information network as vertices, and edges are added between each predicate-argument pairs.",
        "We merge entity mentions across tweets and web documents based on a cross-document entity clustering system described in (Chen and Ji, 2011).",
        "Moreover, for the same type of nodes from the SRL system, we also merge them by string matching across documents.",
        "3.2 Concept Extraction from Images We also developed a concept modeling approach by extending the similar framework in previous work (Tsai et al., 2012), Probabilistic Logical Tree (PLT), to extract semantic concepts from images.",
        "PLT integrates the logical and statistical inferences in a unifying framework where the existing primitive concepts are connected into a potentially unlimited vocabulary of high-level concepts by basic logical operations.",
        "In contrast, most existing image concept extraction algorithms either only learn a flat correlative concept structure, or a simple hierarchical structure without logical connections.",
        "With an efficient statistical learning algorithm, the complex concepts in upper level of PLT are modeled upon some logically connected primitive concepts.",
        "This statistical learning approach is very flexible, where each concept in PLT can be modeled from distinctive feature spaces with the most suitable feature descriptors (e.g., visual features such as color and shape for scenery concepts).",
        "For our case study on ?Hurricane Irene?",
        "scenario, we apply this algorithm to extract the hierarchical concept trees with roots ?flood?",
        "or ?storm?",
        "from all the images in web documents whose URLs are contained in tweets.",
        "The main problem is the classifications of the concepts such that it may be properly be placed onto an ontology.",
        "In order to enrich the hierarchy, we seek to classify these linkages through the use of the semi-structured and structured data that exists on Wikipedia.",
        "We use pattern matching to extract is-a relations from the first paragraphs of Wikipedia articles.",
        "For example, starting from our initial concept ?Hurricane Irene?, we can find its is-a relation with ?Tropical Cyclone?, and then climb up one more level to ?Storm?",
        "where we can further mine lower concepts such as ?Tornado?",
        "and ?Snow Storm?.",
        "76 4 Multi-media Information Networks A Multimedia Information Network (MINet) is a structured collection made up of a set of multimedia documents (e.g., texts and images) and links between these documents.",
        "Each link corresponds to a specific relationship between nodes, such as hyperlinks between web documents or similarity links between tweets.",
        "In this paper, we construct our MINet based on two forms of contents from different domains: tweets, web documents (plain texts) and images.",
        "4.1 Within-media Linking 4.1.1 Text-Text Similarity Taking web document for example, we construct the meta-information network G = {G i : G i = (V i , E i )} for all web documents D, in which each web document d i ?",

        "Given the meta-information network G, we compute the weight of each vertex v j ?",
        "V i as weight v j = nf(v j ,d) AV E(D) , where nf(v j , d) is the mention number of node v j appearing in a document d and AV E(D) is the average number of mentions in a document d, which is defined as AV E(D) = ?",

        "If two edges share the same type and link nodes corresponding to the same tokens, we consider them as two mentions involved in a relation.",
        "Based on the weight of each concept mention and relation mention, we count their frequencies and transform them into vectors.",
        "Finally, we compute cosine similarity between every two vectors.",
        "4.1.2 Image-Image Similarity We extract Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features (Dalal and Triggs, 2005) from patches in images and apply Hierarchical Gaussianization (Zhou et al., 2009) to those HOG feature vectors.",

        "Based on the obtained image representation, the image-image similarity is simply a cosine similarity between two HG super-vectors.",
