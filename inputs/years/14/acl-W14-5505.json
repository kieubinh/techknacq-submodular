        "Abstract",
        "The aim of this paper is to categorize and present the existence of resources for English-to-Urdu machine translation (MT) and to establish an empirical baseline for this task.",
        "By doing so, we hope to set up a common ground for MT research with Urdu to allow for a congruent progress in this field.",
        "We build baseline phrase-based MT (PBMT) and hierarchical MT systems and report the results on 3 official independent test sets.",
        "On all test sets, hierarchial MT significantly outperformed PBMT.",
        "The highest single-reference BLEU score is achieved by the hierarchical system and reaches 21.58% but this figure depends on the randomly selected test set.",
        "Our manual evaluation of 175 sentences suggests that in 45% of sentences, the hierarchical MT is ranked better than the PBMT output compared to 21% of sentences where PBMT wins, the rest being equal."

        "Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) has always been a challenging task for language pairs with significant word ordering differences and rich inflectional morphology.",
        "The language pair such as English and Urdu, despite of descending from the same family of Indo-European languages, differs heavily in syntactic strucure and morphological characteristics.",
        "English is relatively fixed word order language and follows subject-verb-object (SVO) structure whereas Urdu uses restricted free word order language and most commonly follows the SOV pattern.",
        "Urdu word order is restricted for only few parts of speeches such as adjectives always precede nouns and postpositions follow nouns.",
        "Unlike English, Urdu is a pro-drop language.",
        "The morphology of Urdu is similar to other Indo-European languages, e.g. by having inflectional morphological system.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, the research on English-to-Urdu machine translation has been very much fragmented, preventing the authors to build upon the works of others.",
        "Our underlying motivation for this paper is to establish a common ground and provide a concise summary of available data resources and set up reproducible baseline results of several available test sets.",
        "With this basis, future Urdu MT research should be able to stepwise improve the state of the art, in contrast with the scattered experiments done so far (Khan et al., 2013; Ali et al., 2013; Ali and Malik, 2010).",
        "In Section 2, the experimental setup and data processing tools are described.",
        "Existing corpora are introduced in Section 3, automatic results are reported in Section 4 and manual evaluation is discussed in Section 5.",
        "2 Experimental Setup This section briefly introduces the selection of SMT models that are used to build the baseline English-Urdu SMT system and also explains the processing of parallel data before passing it to the MT system.",
        "Licence details: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.",
        "0/ 37 2.1 Two Models of SMT The state-of-the-art MT toolkit Moses1 (Koehn et al., 2007), offers two mainstream models of SMT: phrase-based (PBMT) and syntax-based (SBMT) that includes the hierarchical model.",
        "The PBMT model operates only on mapping of source phrases (short sequences of words) to target phrases.",
        "For dealing with word order differences, two rather weak models are available: lexicalized and distance-based.",
        "The lexicalized reordering models (Tillmann, 2004) are considered more advanced as they condition reordering on the actual phrases, whereas the latter model makes the reordering cost (paid when picking source phrases out of sequence) dependent only on the length of the jump.",
        "The distance-based model is suited well for local reordering but it is fairly weak in capturing any long distance reorderings.",
        "The syntax-based model (SBMT) builds upon Synchronous Context-Free Grammar (SCFG) that synchronously generates source and target sentences.",
        "The grammar rules can either consist of linguistically motivated non-terminals such as NP, VP etc.",
        "or the generic non-terminal ?X?",
        "in which case the model is called ?hierarchical phrase-based?",
        "(Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007).",
        "In either case, the model is capable of capturing long-distance reordering much better than the lexicalized reordering of PBMT.",
        "2.2 Data Processing and MT Training For the training of our en-ur translation systems, the standard training pipeline of Moses is used along with the GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) alignment toolkit and a 5-gram SRILM language model (Stolcke, 2002).",
        "The source texts were processed using the Treex platform (Popel and ?abokrtsk?, 2010)2, which included tokenization and lemmatization.",
        "The target side of the corpus is tokenized using a simple tokenization script3 by Dan Zeman and it is lemmatized using the Urdu Shallow Parser4 developed by Language Technologies Research Center of IIIT Hyderabad.",
        "The alignments are learnt from the lemmatized version of the corpus.",
        "In all other cases, word forms (i.e. no morphological decomposition) in their true case (i.e. names capitalized but sentence starts lowercased) are used.",
        "The lexicalized reordering model uses the feature set called ?msd-bidirectional-fe?.",
        "3 Dataset Parallel and monolingual data resources are very scarce for low-resource language pairs such as English-Urdu.",
        "This section highlights the existing parallel and monolingual data resources that can be utilized for training SMT models.",
        "The number of official test sets are also exhibited.",
        "3.1 Parallel Corpus Our parallel corpus consists of around 79K sentences collected from five different sources.",
        "The collection comes from several domains such as News, Religion, Technology, Language and Culture etc.",
