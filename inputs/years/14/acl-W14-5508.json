        "1.1 Translation via an interlingua Interlingual translation scales easily up to a large number of languages.",
        "Google translate, for example, deals with all pairs of 60 languages mostly by using English as a pivot language.",
        "In this way, it can do with just 2 * 59 = 118 sets of bilingual training data, instead of 60 * 59 = 3540 sets.",
        "It would be hard to collect and maintain so many pairs, and in many cases, there is very little data to be found.",
        "The roots of an inter-lingua are perhaps in the medieval idea of a universal grammar (Lyons, 1968), in which a universal representation of meaning can be expressed.",
        "Translating via this interlingua then also means that meaning is conserved in going from the source to the target language.",
        "In recent decades, this idea appears in (Curry, 1961) where the interlingua is called tectogrammar, in the Rosetta project (Rosetta, 1994), building on the semantic models of (Montague, 1974), and in the UNL (Universal Networking Language) project.",
        "Incidentally, interlingua is also the heart of modern compiler technology.",
        "For instance, the GNU Compiler Collection (Stallman, 2001) uses a shared tree representation to factor out the majority of compilation phases between a large number of source and target languages.",
        "Compiler writers save work, and semantics is preserved by design.",
        "A compiler, then, is built as a pipeline with parsing from a source language to an abstract syntax tree, which is analyzed and optimized in the language-independent phases, and finally linearized to a target language.",
        "License details: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.",
        "0/ 55 It is easy to see an analogy between this pipeline and the way a human language translator could work.",
        "But how to make it real?",
        "How to scale up to the full size of natural languages?",
        "1.2 WordNets In current machine translation research, interlingual methods are marginal, despite the wide use of pivot languages in systems like Google translate.",
        "Closest to the mainstream perhaps is the development of linked WordNets.",
        "The original Princeton Wordnet for English (Miller, 1995) defines a set of word senses, which many other wordnets map to other languages.",
        "Implementations of this idea are Finnish (Lind?n and Carlson., 2010) and Hindi (Hindi-WordNet, 2012).",
        "In the linked Wordnet approach, the Princeton WordNet senses work as an interlingua, albeit only on the level of the lexicon.",
        "(Lind?n and Carlson., 2010) give strong arguments why in fact this is a good way to go, despite the often emphasized fact that different languages divide the world in different ways, so that the senses of their word don't map one to one.",
        "The evidence from the English-Finnish case shows that 80% of the mappings are one-to-one and un-problematic.",
        "As this part of the lexicon can be easily reused, linguists and system builders can concentrate their effort on the remaining 20%.",
        "The Universal WordNet (de Melo and Weikum, 2009) works on the same lines.",
        "Building on the Princeton WordNet, it populates the mappings to over 200 different languages by collecting data from different sources (such as the Wikipedia) and using supervised machine learning techniques to propagate the knowledge and infer more of it.",
        "What makes it a particularly interesting resource is that it is freely available under the most liberal licenses, as is the original Princeton WordNet, 1.3 GF Grammatical Framework (GF)(Ranta, 2004) is a grammar formalism tool based on Martin L?f's type theory (Martin-L?f, 1982).",
        "It can be seen as a tool to build interlingua based translation systems.",
        "GF works like a compiler: the source language is parsed to an abstract syntax tree, which is then linearized to the target language.",
        "The parsing and linearization component are defined by using Parallel Multiple Context-Free Grammars (PMCFG, (Seki et al., 1991), (Ljungl?f, 2004)), which give GF an expressive power between mildly and fully context-sensitive grammars.",
        "Thus GF can easily handle with language-specific variations in morphology, word order, and discontinuous constituents, while maintaining a shared abstract syntax.",
        "Historically, the main use of GF has been in controlled language implementations, e.g., (Ranta and Angelov, 2010; Angelov and Enache, 2010; Ranta et al., 2012) and natural language generation, e.g., (Dymetman et al., 2000), both applied in multilingual settings with up to 15 parallel languages.",
        "In recent years, the coverage of GF grammars and the processing performance has enabled open-domain tasks such as treebank parsing (Angelov, 2011) and hybrid translation of patents (Enache et al., 2012).",
        "The general purpose Resource Grammar Library (RGL)(Ranta, 2011) has grown to 30 languages.",
        "It includes the major European languages, South Asian languages like Hindi/Urdu (Prasad and Shafqat, 2012), Nepali and Punjabi (Shafqat et al., 2011), the Southeast Asian language Thai, and Japanese and Chinese.",
        "However, GF has yet not been exploited for arbitrary text parsing and translation.",
        "To do this, we have to meet several challenges: robust parsing, parse-tree disambiguation, word sense disambiguation, and development of a wide-coverage interlingual translation lexicon.",
        "This paper focuses on the latter two.",
        "We report first a method of using the WordNets (Princeton and Universal) to build an interlingual full-form, multiple sense translation lexicon.",
        "Then, we show how these lexicons together with a word sense disambiguation tool can be plugged in a translation pipeline.",
        "Finally, we describe an experimental setup and give many examples to highlight the effects of this work.",
        "56 1.4 South Asian languages While the work described here can apply to any language, it is particularly interesting for South Asian languages.",
        "In these languages, statistical tools do not have much bilingual training data to work on, so Google translate and similar tools are not as useful as they are with better resourced languages.",
        "At the same time, there is an urgent and widely recognised need for translations from English to the various languages of South Asia.",
        "Fortunately, word nets are being built for many of them, so that the techniques described here can be applied.",
        "2 From Universal WordNet to a GF Lexicon The original Princeton WordNet (Miller, 1995) defines a set of word senses, and the Universal WordNet (de Melo and Weikum, 2009) maps them to different languages.",
        "In this multilingual scenario, the Princeton WordNet senses can be seen as an abstract representation, while the Universal WordNet mappings can be seen as concrete representation of those senses in different languages.",
        "GF grammars use very much the same technique of one common abstract and multiple parallel concrete representations to achieve multilingualism.",
        "Due to this compatibility, it is easy to build a multilingual GF lexicon using data from those two resources (i.e. Princeton and Universal WordNets).",
        "This section briefly describes the experiment we did to build one abstract and multiple concrete GF lexicons for a number of languages including German, French, Finnish, Swedish, Hindi, and Bulgarian.",
        "The method is very general, so can be used to build a similar lexicon for any other language for which data is available in the Universal WordNet.",
        "2.1 GF",
        "Abstract",
        "Lexicon The Princeton WordNet data is distributed in the form of different database files.",
        "For each of the four lexical categories (i.e. noun, verb, adjective, and adverb), two files named ?index.pos?",
        "and ?data.pos?",
        "are provided, where ?pos?",
        "is noun, verb, adj and adv.",
        "Each of the ?index.pos?",
        "files contains all words, including synonyms of the words, found in the corresponding part of speech category.",
        "Each of the ?data.pos?",
        "files contains information about unique senses belonging to the corresponding part of speech category.",
        "For our purposes, there were two possible choices to build an abstract representation of the lexicon: 1.",
        "To include all words of the four lexical categories, and also their synonyms (i.e. to build the lexicon from ?index.pos?",
        "files) 2.",
        "To include only unique senses of the four categories with one word per sense, but not the synonyms (i.e. to build the lexicon from the data.pos?",
        "files) To better understand this difference, consider the words ?brother?",
        "and ?buddy?.",
        "The word ?brother?",
        "has five senses with sense offsets ?08111676?, ?08112052?, ?08112961?, ?08112265?",
        "and ?08111905?",
        "in the Princeton WordNet 1.7.11, while the word ?buddy?",
        "has only one sense with the sense offset ?08112961?.",
        "Choosing option (1) means that we have to include the following entries in our abstract lexicon.",
        "brother_08111676_N brother_08112052_N brother_08112961_N brother_08112265_N brother_08111905_N buddy_08112961_N We can see that the sense with the offset ?08112961?",
        "is duplicated in the lexicon: once with the lemma ?brother?",
        "and then with the lemma ?buddy?.",
        "However, if we choose option (2), we end up with the following entries.",
        "1We choose WordNet 1.7.1, because the word sense disambiguator that we are using in our translation pipeline is based on WordNet 1.7.1 57 brother_08111676_N brother_08112052_N brother_08112265_N brother_08111905_N buddy_08112961_N Since the file ?data.noun?",
        "lists the unique senses rather than the words, their will be no duplication of the senses.",
        "However, the choice has an obvious effect on the lexicon coverage, and depending on whether we want to use it as a parsing or as a linearization lexicon, the choice becomes critical.",
        "Currently, we choose option (2) for the following two reasons: 1.",
        "The Universal WordNet provides mappings for synsets (i.e. unique senses) but not for the individual synonyms of the synsets.",
        "If we choose option (1), as mentioned previously, we have to list all synonyms in our abstract representation.",
        "But, as translations are available only for synsets, we have to put the same translation against each of the synonyms of the synset in our concrete representations.",
        "This will not gain us anything (as long as we use these lexicon as linearization lexicons), but will increase the size of the lexicon and hence may have reduce the processing speed of the translation system.",
        "2.",
        "At the current stage of our experiments we are using these lexicons as linearization lexicons, so one translation of each unique sense is enough.",
        "Our abstract GF lexicon covers 91516 synsets out of around 111,273 synsets in the WordNet 1.7.1.",
        "We exclude some of the synsets with multi-word lemmas.",
        "We consider them more of a syntactic category rather than a lexical category, and hence deal with them at the syntax level.",

        "To show the usefulness of the lexicons described in section 2 and for comparison, we translate the same source twice: with and without word sense disambiguation.",
        "For the first attempt, we used exactly the same translation pipeline as shown in Figure 1, except that to overcome the deficiencies of our existing parse-tree disambiguator, for some of the examples, we used trees directly from the PennTreebank, which are supposed to be correct.",

        "Manual inspection, however, was much more encouraging, and explained the reasons for very low improvements in the BLEU scores in some cases.",

        "It should be noted that the coverage of the Hindi lexicon is lowest of all the lexicons given in Table 1.",
        "The result is that many sentences have missing words in the translations.",
        "Also, there is considerable interference with Urdu words (some stemming from the shared base grammar (Prasad and Shafqat, 2012)).",
        "Further, some mappings coming from the Universal WordNet data are in roman, as opposed to Devanagari (the usual script for Hindi, and what the grammar is based on), so these need to be transcribed.",

        "This leaves a window for improvement in the quality of the reported lexicons.",
        "One way of improvement is the manual inspection/correction, not an easy task for a wide-coverage lexicon with around 100 thousand entries, but not impossible either.",
        "This would be a one-time task with a strong impact on the quality of the lexicon.",
        "Another way is to use manually built WordNets, such as the Finnish and Hindi WordNets.",
        "In our work, the availability of some of these resources was an issue, so we leave it for the future.",
        "Further, as mentioned in Section 4, the Hindi lexicon has some script-related issues which should be fixed in future.",
        "When it comes to interlingua-based arbitrary machine translation, an important concern is the size of lexicons.",
        "We are aware of the fact that the size of our lexicons is not comparable to some of the other similar systems such as ATLAS-II (Fujitsu), where the size of lexicons is in millions.",
        "We have plan to extend the size of lexicons using some of the other publicly available resources (such as Hindi WordNet) and/or using parallel corpus.",
        "The development of bilingual lexicons form parallel corpus have been previously explored (Delpech et al., 2012; Qian et al., 2012), and the same ideas can be applied in our case.",
        "6 Conclusion We have shown how to use existing lexical resources such as WordNets to develop an interlingual translation lexicon in GF, and how to use it for the WSD task in an arbitrary text translation pipeline.",
        "The improvements in the translation quality (lexical), shown by examples in Section 4, are encouraging and motivate further work in this direction.",
        "However, it should be noted that there is still a lot of work to be done (especially in the open domain text parsing and parse-tree disambiguation phases of the translation pipeline) to bring the translation system to a competitive level.",
        "For the reasons noted in the introduction, we expect our techniques to be particularly useful for South Asian languages.",
