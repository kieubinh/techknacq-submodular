        "Named entity recognition (NER) is a basic task in natural language processing and one of the most important subtasks in Information Extraction.",
        "It is really essential to identify objects and extract relations between them.",
        "Moreover, recognizing proper names from news articles or newswires is also useful in detecting events and monitoring them.",
        "The NER task aims to identify and classify certain proper nouns into some pre-defined target entity classes such as person (PER), organization (ORG), location (LOC), temporal expressions (TIME), monetary values (MON), and percentage (PCT).",
        "Several previous works in NER have been done on languages such as English (J.",
        "Sun et al., 2002; C.W.",
        "Shih et al., 2004), Japanese (R. Sasano and S. Kurohashi, 2008), Chinese (J.",
        "Sun et al., 2002; C.W.",
        "Shih et al., 2004), and Vietnamese (N.C. Tu et al., 2005; T.X.",
        "T. Pham et al., 2007; Q.T.",
        "Tran et al., 2007); and NER systems have been developed using supervised learning methods such as Decision Tree, Maximum Entropy model (D. Nadeau and S. Sekine, 2007), and Support Vector Machine (Q.T.",
        "Tran et al., 2007), which achieved high performance.",
        "Moreover, there are several studies for bilingual named entity recognition (C.J.",
        "Lee et al., 2006; D. Feng et al., 2004; F. Huang and S. Vogel, 2002).",
        "However, for the English-Vietnamese pair, this task still presents a significant challenge in a number of important respects (R. Sasano and S. Kurohashi, 2008).",
        "Firstly, words in Vietnamese are not always separated by spaces, so word segmentation is necessary and segmentation errors will affect the level of NER performance.",
        "Secondly, some proper names of foreign persons and locations are loanwords or represented by phonetic symbols, so we can expect wide variations in some Vietnamese terms.",
        "Thirdly, there are considerably fewer available existing resources such as lexicons, parsers, word nets, etc.",
        "for Vietnamese that have been used in previous studies.",
        "85 In this study, we suggest a process to build a bilingual named entity corpus from aligned news express articles.",
        "In fact, this process is applied to build an English-Vietnamese Named Entity Corpus by using available English named entity recognition to tag entities in the English text, and then map them into Vietnamese text based on word alignments.",
        "The mapping results are also corrected manually by using a visualization tool.",
        "The remainder of this paper describes the details of our work.",
        "Firstly we address the data source for building the corpus in Section 2.",
        "Next, we present a procedure to build an English-Vietnamese Named Entity Corpus by using a bilingual corpus and mapping English entities into Vietnamese entity tags in Section 3.",
        "Experimental results and conclusion appear in Sections 4 and 5, respectively.",
        "2 Tagset and Data Source 2.1 Tagset for Named Entities There are many tagsets for the NER task, such as the hierarchical named entity tagset with 150 types (S. Sekine et al., 2002), the biological named entity tagset (Y. Tateisi et al., 2000; J-D Kim et al., 2003), or common named entity tagsets with 3 types and 7 tags (N. Chinchor and P. Robinson, 1998).",
        "According to the definition of the MUC-7 conference (N. Chinchor and P. Robinson, 1998), we will identify six types of named entities: ?",
        "PERSON (PER): Person entities are limited to humans identified by name, nickname or alias.",
        "?",
        "ORGANIZATION (ORG): Organization entities are limited to corporations, institutions, government agencies and other groups of people defined by an established organizational structure.",
        "?",
        "LOCATION (LOC): Location entities include names of politically or geographically defined places (cities, provinces, countries, international regions, bodies of water, mountains, etc.).",
        "Locations also include man-made structures like airports, highways, streets, factories and monuments.",
        "?",
        "TIME (TIM): Date/Time entities are complete or partial expressions of time of day, or date expressions.",
        "?",
        "PERCENTAGE (PCT): Percentage entities are percentage expressions, including percentage range expressions.",
        "?",
        "MONEY (MON): Money entities include monetary expressions.",
        "We have developed a guide for bilingual named entity tagging and published it as EnVnNEguide at http://code.google.com/p/evbcorpus/downloads/list.",
        "2.2 Data Source The data source for building the English-Vietnamese named entity corpus is a part of the EVBCorpus 1 , which consists of both original English text and its Vietnamese translations.",
        "It contains 1,000 news articles defined as the EVBNews part of the EVBCorpus (as shown in Table 1) (Q.H.",
        "Ngo et al., 2013).",
        "This corpus is also aligned semi-automatically at the word level.",
        "In particular, each article was translated one to one at the whole article level, so we align sentence to sentence.",
        "Then, sentences are aligned semi-automatically at the word level, including automatic alignment by class-based method (D. Dien et al., 2002) and use of the BiCAT tool (Q.H.",
        "Ngo and W. Wini-warter, 2012) to correct the alignments manually.",
        "The details of the corpus are listed in Table 1.",
        "Parallel documents are also chosen and classified into categories, such as economy, entertainment (art and music), health, science, social, politics, and technology (percentage of each category is shown in Table 2 and Figure 1).",
        "The wide range of categories ensures that named entities in the corpus are diversified enough for other following tasks.",
        "86 Figure 1: The distribution of articles and sentences in each topic in EVBNews Table 1: Characteristics of EVBNews part English Vietnamese Files 1,000 1,000 Paragraphs 25,015 25,015 Sentences 45,531 45,531 Words 740,534 832,441 Words in Alignments 654,060 768,031 3 Building Named Entity Corpus 3.1 Model of Building EVNECorpus from EVBCorpus Figure 2 shows the main modules of bilingual named entity corpus building, including three main mod-ules: pre-processing, named entity recognition, bilingual entity mapping, and bilingual entity correction.",
        "According to this workflow, the bilingual corpus will be tagged with named entities on the English text, then, named entities are mapped from English to Vietnamese text.",
        "Finally, annotators will correct both English and Vietnamese named entities by using the BiCAT tool (Q.H.",
        "Ngo and W. Winiwarter, 2012).",
        "At the first stage, a Named Entity Recognition system is used to tag English entities in the English sentence.",
        "Several Named Entity Recognition systems for English text are available online.",
        "For traditional NER, the most popular publicly available systems are: OpenNLP NameFinder 2 , Illinois NER 3 system by Lev Ratinov (L. Ratinov and D. Roth, 2009), Stanford NER 4 system by Jenny Rose Finkel (J.R. Finkel et al., 3005), and Lingpipe NER 5 system by Baldwin, B. and B. Carpenter (B. Carpenter, 2006).",
        "The Stanford NER reports 86.86 F1 on the CoNLL03 NER shared task data.",

        "Ngo and W. Winiwarter, 2012) for correcting named entities in both English and Vietnamese sentences.",
        "The BiCAT tool is a visualization tool based on drag, drop, and edit label operations (actions) to correct the sentence pairs.",
