        "In this paper we present Biografix, a pattern based tool that simplifies parenthetical structures with biographical information, whose aim is to create simple, readable and accessible sentences.",
        "To that end, we analysed the parenthetical structures that appear in the first paragraph of the Basque Wikipedia, and concentrated on biographies.",
        "Although it has been designed and developed for Basque we adapted it and evaluated with other five languages.",
        "We also perform an extrinsic evaluation with a question generation system to see if Biografix improve its results."

        "and motivation Parentheticals are expressions, somehow structurally independent, that integrated in a text function as modifiers of phrases, sentences..., and add information or comments to the text.",
        "Therefore, it has been argued that they interrupt the prosodic flow, breaking the intonation.",
        "According to Deh?e and Kavalova (2007), parentheticals can be realised in different ways: one-word parentheticals, sentence adverbials, comment clauses and reporting verbs, nominal apposition and non-restrictive relative clauses, question tags, clauses and backtracking.",
        "Besides, the authors argue that sometimes the parentheticals are not related to the host sentence neither semantically nor pragmatically, but they are understood in the text due to the situational context.",
        "Some parentheticals can be the result of a stylistic choice (Blakemore, 2006) and that is the case of parenthetical information found in the first paragraph of some Wikipedia articles.",
        "As stated in the Wikipedia guidelines 1 the first paragraph of the articles should contain resuming and important information.",
        "That is why the information is there so condensed.",
        "Apart from condensing the information parentheticals cause long sentences, which are more difficult to process both for humans and for advanced applications.",
        "Moreover, web writting style books (Amatria et al., 2013) suggest not to use parenthetical constructs because they make more difficult the access to the information.",
        "Simple wikipedia guidelines 2 recommend also not to use two sets of brackets next to each other.",
        "NLP applications such as question generation systems (QG) for educational domain 3 may fail when finding important information in brackets.",
        "For example, if we want to create questions, systems such as the presented in Aldabe et al. (2013) will look for a verb 4 .",
        "In the case of parenthetical biographical information there is no verb which makes explicit when the person is born or when she or he died.",
        "So, no question will be created based on that information.",
        "The study of parentheticals in Basque has been limited to the analysis of the irony in the narrativity of Koldo Mitxelena (Azpeitia, 2011).",
        "In the present study we analyse the parentheticals that are used in the first paragraph of the Basque Wikipedia and developed a rule-based tool Biografix to detect these ",
        "1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style (last accessed: March, 2014) 2 http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style (last accessed: March, 2014) 3 Question generation is important in learning technologies (intelligent tutoring systems, inquiry-based environments, and game-based learning environments), virtual environments and dialogue systems among others.",
        "http://www.",
        "questiongeneration.org/ (last accessed: April, 2014) 4 Both systems (one chunk-based and another dependency-based) presented in Aldabe et al. (2013) follow the guidelines presented in Rus and Graesser (2009).",
        "11 structures and to create new sentences out of them.",
        "To be more concrete, we concentrate on biographical information since there are not explicit words in text that give a clue about what type of information it is.",
        "Our aim is to make more readable sentences and, consequently, to eliminate the interruption they cause.",
        "About the domain of biographies, their automatic generation has been studied (Duboue et al., 2003) in Natural Language Generation (NLG).",
        "In this research line, referring expressions to people have been studied for automatic summarisation of news (Siddharthan et al., 2011).",
        "The quality of the biographies (linguistic and content) has been recently analysed in the English Wikipedia (Flekova et al., 2014).",
        "We want also to make a first step towards the simplification of Basque Wikipedia, since English simple wikipedia has been a great resource for Text Simplification (TS) and Readability Assessement (RA).",
        "Efforts for simple wikipedia have also been made for Portuguese (Junior et al., 2011) using TS techniques.",
        "Although Biografix has been specially developed for Basque, being pattern-based, we have also evaluated its adaptation to other languages.",
        "This work is not limited to wikipedia, Biografix can be used on other types of text as well, since these structures can be found in educational texts, newspapers and so on.",
        "This paper is structured as follows: after this introduction we report in section 2 the treatment of parentheticals in TS and in Wikipedia.",
        "In section 3 we describe Biografix and in section 4 we report its evaluation.",
        "Finally, we conclude and outline the future work in section 5.",
        "2 Parenthetical Structures In this section we report the treatment that parenthentical structures have undergone in TS and other NLP applications.",
        "We also describe the parentheticals found in Basque Wikipedia.",
        "Parentheticals have been object of study in TS and three main operations have been proposed: a) parentheticals have been removed out of the texts (Drndarevi?c et al., 2013), b) parentheticals have been removed but they have been kept in another form (Aranzabe et al., 2012; Seretan, 2012) or c) parentheticals have been added to explain the meaning by short paraphrases (Hallett and Hardcastle, 2008) or hyperonyms (Leroy et al., 2013).",
        "In any case, it is usually recommended to avoid them (Alu?",
        "?sio et al., 2008).",
        "In other NLP applications such as summarisation they are usually removed and even some QG works follow the same strategy, in case they are not relevant (Heilman and Smith, 2010).",
        "2.1 Parenthetical Structures in Basque Wikipedia Wikipedia guidelines emphasise the importance of the first paragraph.",
        "It should indeed contain a summary of the most significant information.",
        "To concentrate all the information, stylistic resources such as parenthentical structures are used.",
        "The information that is written in brackets in the Basque Wikipedia can be classified in two groups: a) information about people and b) information about concepts.",
        "About people biographical data and mandates are usually found and about concepts the etymology of words is frequent.",
        "Translations or transliterations of the named entity or the concept is found for both groups.",
        "On the other hand, there are other frequent parenthetical structures that are found in the first paragraph, but they are not written in brackets.",
        "This is the case of the nicknames, which are written in commas.",
        "This kind of information is also found in other languages.",
        "After this analysis, we decided to concentrate on biographical data to create new sentences out of that information.",
        "Biographical data Contrary to English Wikipedia, in Basque Wikipedia the information contained in bracket is, if known, birthplace (town, province, state), date of birth, and if the person is dead, date of death and place of dead.",
        "This is the case as well of the Catalan, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, German and French Wikipedia among others, although sometimes paraphrases are found in brackets.",
        "For French there is, for example, more than a way to write the biographical data 5 .",
        "In Basque Wikipedia guidelines 6 it is stated that biographical data should be written as in examples 1 and 2.",
        "If the person is dead, we see in example 1 that the birth data (town, state and date) and the death data (town, state and date) are linked by a dash.",

        "However, biographical data is not frequently written uniformly.",

        "Taking into account this guidelines and the articles we have analysed, we have developed Biografix, a pattern based tool that detects biographical data and creates new sentences with this information.",
        "This tool was originally developed for Basque but it has been adapted to other languages.",
        "An adaptation of this tool, moreover, could be used as a first step into Text Summarisation, if we only remove the parentheticals and do not create new sentences.",

        "(7) Cambridge Ingalaterran dago.",
        "?Cambridge is in England.?",
        "So, if the person is dead, Biografix will write first the main sentence (3) followed by a new sentence (4) with the information about the birth.",
        "If the birthplace is composed by more than a place entity, sentences like (5) will be written.",
        "After the birth information, a sentence will contain the information about the death (6).",
        "For the cases that more than a place appear, those will be rewritten (7).",
        "If the person is alive like in example 2 in subsection 2.1, the same process will take place, but no death information will appear by creating the new sentences 8, 9 and 10.",
        "(8) Karlos Argi?nano Urkiola, nazioartean Karlos Argui?nano grafiaz ezagunagoa, sukaldari, aktore eta enpresaburu euskalduna da.",

        "(10) Beasain Gipuzkoan dago.",
        "?Beasain is in Gipuzkoa.?",
        "So, first, main information will be kept (8) and then the information about the birth will appear (9).",
        "As a second place information (the province) original sentence (2), it will be rewritten as well (10).",
        "We have to mention that we use the title of the article as the subject of the sentences containing the biographical information.",
        "That is way we see that in sentences 9 and 10 the subject is Karlos Argi?nano and the subject in sentence 8 is Karlos Argi?nano Urkiola.",
        "We took this decision for cases where the real name of person is not so known, e.g. Cherilyn Sarkisian.",
        "Had we used Cherilyn Sarkisian in all the sentences, would someone have known we are talking about Cher?",

        "Splitting: In this stage we get the parts of the sentences we are going to work with.",
        "To that end, three steps take place: a) the parenthetical structure is removed from the original sentence; b) the type of parenthetical expression is checked looking at whether there are birth and death data or only the former; c) dates and places are split.",
        "We use simple patterns to detect the dates and the places.",
        "As it is possible to find more than a place, they will be split by the commas.",

        "Reconstruction: The new simplified sentences are created in this stage.",
        "This part is language-dependent, since we add the verbs, determinants, prepositions and case markers.",
        "In the case of Basque we also remove the absolutive case that is found in some articles 7 .",
        "Anyway, we create three kind of sentences that are common for all the languages with the constructs obtained in the splitting stage: a) sentences indicating birth data, b) sentences indicating death data and c) sentences indicating place specifications.",
        "The main sentence will be kept as in the original version (the parenthetical has been removed in the splitting stage).",
        "?",
        "Reordering: The sentences will be ordered in text.",

        "Correction: The aim of this stage is to check if there are any mistake in the new sentences and to correct them.",

        "Biografix has been designed for Basque and then the reconstruction stage has been adapted to other 7 languages: French, German, Spanish, Catalan, Galician, Italian and Portuguese.",
        "To develop the Basque version we implemented the guidelines in Wikipedia (see subsection 2.1) and we used a small corpus of 50 sentences to find possible cases, where the guidelines are not fulfilled.",
        "These 50 sentences were randomly crawled.",
        "For other languages, we did not make any change in the splitting stage but for German.",
        "According to German Wikipedia guidelines birth and death data are separated by a semicolon and not by a dash.",
        "Although French, Spanish and Italian have other options to express the biographical information between bracket we did not implement them.",
        "Our aim is not to create a tool specially for these languages, but to see if the design for Basque can be applicable to other languages.",
        "That is why, the adaptations to other languages are available at our website 8 , if someone wants to improve them.",
        "7 The absolutive case is used according to the format of the date.",
        "8 https://ixa.si.ehu.es/Ixa/Produktuak/1403535629 14 Other improvements could be done in the reconstruction stage.",
        "To rewrite the sentences we have used the most familiar past tense in each language.",
        "The only exception was French.",
        "The most familiar past tense according to the context is the pass?e compos?e but this tense requires the agreement of the gender between subject and verb 9 .",
        "As the pass?e simple is not very familiar we decided to use the present tense to avoid the concordance problem.",
        "So, this could be one of the things to take into account for future developers.",
        "No other changes should be done in the reordering stage but the correction has to be adapted to each language.",
        "No training was performed for the other languages.",
        "Only 3-5 sentences were used to check that there were no errors.",
        "4 Evaluation In order to evaluate Biografix we crawled the first sentence of 30 Wikipedia articles.",
        "The method to select these articles was the following: a) we used CatScan V2.0?",
        "10 to get a list of the Biographies in Basque Wikipedia; b) we randomised that list and make another list to see which articles were written in 8 languages (Basque, Catalan, French, Galician, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish); c) we selected the first 32 articles.",
        "The first two articles were used to explain and train the annotators.",
        "The final test-sample had, therefore, 30 items.",
        "Having that sample, we performed two evaluations: a manual evaluation (section 4.1) and a extrinsic evaluation with a question generation system (section 4.2).",
        "4.1 Manual evaluation The manual evaluation was carried out for 6 languages: Basque, Catalan, French, Galician, German and Spanish.",
        "10 linguists took part in the evaluation process and they evaluated three aspects of the task: the original sentences (JatTestua), Biografix performance (Prog) and the grammaticality of the new simplified sentences (Gram).",
        "In total they answered nine yes/no questions.",
        "This evaluation method we are proposing is useful to perform an error analysis and find out which are the weak points of our tool.",
        "To evaluate the performance and the adaptation of Biografix we chose six languages according to the format of the biographical data: i) Basque (the language Biografix has been designed for) ii) Catalan (same format as Basque), iii) German (same format but a slightly variation), iv) Spanish (same format as Basque but other options as well), v) French (same format as Basque in one of the parenthetical formats and other options), vi) Galician (without defined format).",
        "Portuguese and Italian were not evaluated because their case studies were already evaluated with Catalan and Spanish.",
        "All the sample were evaluated by two annotators except for Catalan and Galician, because Catalan has the same case study as Basque and Galician has not a predefined format that could cause confusion.",
        "Questions concerning the original sentences (JatTestua) Three questions were presented in regards to the original sentence in Wikipedia.",
        "The aim is to know if the original sentences do have parenthetical structures and therefore, how many of them are candidates to simplification (coverage).",

        "2.",
        "Is the sentence grammatically correct and standard?",
        "3.",
        "Is the punctuation correct?",
        "We asked about the grammaticality and the punctuation of original sentences (correctness) because it was shown in Aldabe et al. (2013) that many source sentences were incorrect and that fact decreased the performance of the question generators and the correctness of the created questions.",

        "The German version of Biografix was able to simplify all the sentences found in the test-sample and its recall is high (0.88).",
        "Its weak point is the precision at performance (0.60), as in other languages, due to the fact that the second question of Prog is not satisfied.",
        "The sentence it creates are quite acceptable (0.71) as well.",
        "Surprisingly, both linguists agreed in all the cases and questions.",
        "So, we conclude that the German adaptation was successful.",
        "Finally, in the case of the Spanish adaptation, we see that the precision is very low (0.33) since there was an important information loss.",
        "However, the grammatical precision (0.67) is acceptable.",
        "Although ?",
        "is higher (0.52) than in other languages, observed agreement is not far from Basque (88.76).",
        "It is remarkable as well that being Spanish a long time normalised language only the 85.00 % of the source sentence are correct and that although there are other formats to express the biographical information the coverage is absolute (100.00).",
        "The main disagreement was found when evaluating the grammar and the punctuation due to different criteria of the annotators.",
        "For some of them sentences without verb were correct because they considered that there was an elided verb.",
        "In our opinion, as we are trying to simplify, we think that all the sentences should have a finite verb.",
        "Annotators did not have to much trouble to answer the four Prog questions, so we think that this is a good methodology, and, moreover, it makes easy to perform error analysis.",
        "We want to point out that ?",
        "has not been the best measure but we have used it as we consider that it is a standard to measure data reliability.",
        "To conclude, we find that there is room to improve the versions in other languages, above all trying not to lose information but the adaptation of Biografix has been a good starting point.",
        "In fact, the adaptation has been quite satisfactory for German and Catalan, because they share the format with Basque but they should be further analysed.",
        "As foreseen, the languages with different formats like Galician, Spanish and French require a bigger analysis.",
        "17 4.2 Extrinsic evaluation To evaluate the performance of Biografix throughout another NLP advanced application, we used the web application Seneko (Lopez-Gazpio and Maritxalar, 2013) 11 , the application of the chunk-based question generation system for educational purposes presented in Aldabe et al. (2013).",
        "This kind of evaluation was only performed for Basque.",
        "We ran Seneko with the original sentences and the simplified sentences.",
        "The number of the generated questions is presented in table 2.",
        "We break down the results on the basis of the case markers as well.",
        "In agglutinative languages like Basque case markers are the morphemes that express the grammatical functions.",
        "Source file Total Absolutive Inessive Genitive Other Original sentences 34 23 7 2 2 Simplified sentences 142 65 66 8 3 Table 2: Questions generated by Seneko using the original and the simplified sentences Using as input the original sentences Seneko is able to create 34 questions, more or less a question per sentence.",
        "23 of them have been generated for the absolutive case, that is, for the subject and the predicative, and only 7 of them have been generated for the inessive.",
        "Taking into account that we are working with biographical information, this is a bad result because the inessive case in Basque is used to express time and place relations.",
        "That is, the inessive is used to create questions with the question words When and Where.",
        "On the other hand, using as source the simplified sentences, 65 questions have been generated for the absolutive and 66 for the inessive.",
        "This way, we see that using Biografix's output Seneko has been able to generate questions about place and time expressions.",
        "Next, in 11 and 12 we show an example of the questions generated by Seneko.",
        "In 11 we find that using the original input it was only able to create a question, and it makes no sense but using the simplified text (example 12) Seneko creates two correct questions.",
        "(11) a.",
        "Source text: Eduardo Hughes Galeano (Montevideo, 1940ko irailaren 3a - ) Uruguaiko kazetari eta idazlea da.",
        "?Eduardo Hughes Galeano (Montevideo, 3rd of September, 1940 - ) is an Uruguayan journalist and writer.?",

        "Where was born Eduardo Hughes Galeano on the 3rd of September, 1940??",
        "This way, we conclude that Biografix is an useful tool to improve the performance of question generation systems like Seneko.",
        "5 Conclusion and future work In this paper we have presented Biografix, a tool that detects parenthetical structures and simplifies the biographical data in order to create new more readable sentences.",
        "Although Biografix has been 11 http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/seneko/ (last accessed: March, 2014) 18 designed and developed for Basque, we have applied it to the parenthetical biographical information written in other seven languages: French, German, Spanish, Catalan, Galician, Italian and Portuguese.",
        "The results of the evaluation show that the Basque version obtains very good results but the adaptations should be further developed.",
        "Anyway, good results have been obtained for Catalan and German and promising for Spanish and French.",
        "Besides, we have shown its validity through an extrinsic evaluation with Seneko, a question generation system.",
        "These systems are important for the educational domain, and the improvement Biografix offers is considerable.",
        "Although we have used Wikipedia to develop and evaluate Biografix, it can be used for other kind of text with parenthetical biographical information.",
        "For the future, we plan to continue analysing and implementing rules for other kind of parenthetical structures like etymology, translations of named entities or mandates of relevant people.",
        "We also plan to link the entities to the their articles in Wikipedia to offer additional information.",
        "Patterns could also be improved using previously developed analysers or tools, but this way the splitting stage will become language-dependent.",
        "Moreover, we cannot forget that this work is included in the main framework of the TS system for Basque that we are developing and this is another step towards the main aim of getting easier and more readable Basque texts.",
        "Acknowledgements Itziar Gonzalez-Dios's work is funded by a PhD grant from the Basque Government.",
