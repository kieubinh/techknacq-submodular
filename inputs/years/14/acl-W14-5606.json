        "In the state of the art, there are scarce resources available to support development and evaluation of automatic text simplification (TS) systems for specific target populations.",
        "These comprise parallel corpora consisting of texts in their original form and in a form that is more accessible for different categories of target reader, including neurotypical second language learners and young readers.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the potential to exploit resources developed for such readers to support the development of a text simplification system for use by people with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD).",
        "We analysed four corpora in terms of nineteen linguistic features which pose obstacles to reading comprehension for people with ASD.",
        "The results indicate that the Britannica TS parallel corpus (aimed at young readers) and the Weekly Reader TS parallel corpus (aimed at second language learners) may be suitable for training a TS system to assist people with ASD.",
        "Two sets of classification experiments intended to discriminate between original and simplified texts according to the nineteen features lent further support for those findings."

        "As a fundamental human right, people with reading and comprehension difficulties are entitled to access written information (UN, 2006).",
        "This entitlement enables better inclusion into society.",
        "However, the vast majority of texts that such people encounter in their everyday life ?",
        "especially newswire texts ?",
        "are lexically and syntactically very complex.",
        "Since the late nineties, several initiatives have emerged which propose guidelines for producing plain, easy-to-read and more accessible documents.",
        "These include the ?Federal Plain Language Guidelines?",
        "1 , ?Make it Simple, European Guidelines for the Production of Easy-to-Read Information for people with Learning Disability?",
        "(Freyhoff et al., 1998), ?Am I making myself clear?",
        "Mencap's guidelines for accessible writing?",
        "2 , and the W3C ?",
        "Web Accessibility Initiative guidelines 3 .",
        "However, manual adaptation of texts cannot match the speed with which new texts are published on the web in order to provide up to date information.",
        "The aim of Automatic Text Simplification (ATS) is to automatically (or at least semi-automatically) convert complex sentences into a more accessible form while preserving their original meaning.",
        "In the last twenty years, many ATS systems have been proposed for different target populations in various languages (Carroll et al., 1998; Devlin and Unthank, 2006; Saggion et al., 2011; Inui et al., 2003; Alu?",
        "?sio et al., 2008).",
        "Due to the scarcity of parallel corpora of original and manually simplified texts, most of these systems are rule-based.",
        "The emergence of Simple English Wikipedia (SEW) 4 , together with the existing English Wikipedia (EW) 5 provided a large amount of parallel TS training data, which motivated a shift in English TS from rule-based to data-driven approaches (Yatskar et al., 2010; Biran et al., 2011; Woodsend and Lapata, 2011; Coster and Kauchak, 2011; Wubben et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2010).",

        "The only instructions given to the authors of SEW are to use Basic English vocabulary and shorter sentences.",
        "The main page states that SEW is for everyone, including children and adults who are learning English.",
        "All previously mentioned studies conducted on that corpus evaluated the quality of the generated output in terms of grammaticality, meaning preservation, and simplicity, but not usefulness.",
        "Also, there have been no comparisons of the types of transformations present in EW?SEW with any of the other TS corpora in English which were simplified with a specific target population in mind, e.g. Encyclopedia Britannica and its manually simplified versions for children ?",
        "Britannica Elementary (Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003) 6 , Guardian Weekly and its manually simplified versions for language learners (Allen, 2009), and the FIRST corpus of various texts simplified for people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) 7 .",
        "In this study, we compare the original and simplified texts of the four aforementioned TS corpora in terms of nineteen features which measure the complexity of texts for people with ASD.",
        "Although these features were derived from user requirements for people with ASD, many of them are known to present reading obstacles for other target populations as well (e.g. children or language learners).",
        "Given the lack of parallel TS corpora for people with ASD, our main goal is to investigate whether the EW?SEW or the other two corpora aimed at children and language learners could be used as training material for a TS system to assist people with ASD and thus enable data-driven approaches (instead of the currently used rule-based ones).",
        "In order to further support the results of this analysis, we conduct several classification experiments in which we try to distinguish between original and simplified texts in each of the four corpora, using the nineteen features.",
        "2 The FIRST Project and User Requirements Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders characterised by qualitative impairment in communication and stereotyped repetitive behaviour.",
        "People with ASD show a diverse range of reading abilities: 5-10% have the capacity to read words from an early age without the need for formal learning (hyperlexia) but many demonstrate reduced comprehension of what has been read (Volk- mar and Wiesner, 2009).",
        "They may have difficulty inferring contextual information or may have trouble understanding mental verbs, emotional language, and long sentences with complex syntactic structure (Tager-Flusberg, 1981; Kover et al., 2012).",
        "To address these difficulties, a tool is being developed in the FIRST project 8 to assist in the process of making texts more accessible for people with ASD.",
        "To achieve this, three modues are exploited: 1.",
        "Structural complexity processor, which detects syntactically complex sentences and generates alternatives to such sentences in the form of sequences of shorter sentences (Evans et al., 2014; Dornescu et al., 2013).",
        "2.",
        "Meaning disambiguator, which resolves pronominal references, performs word sense disambigua-tion, and detects lexicalised (conventional) metaphors (Barbu et al., 2013).",
        "3.",
        "Personalised document generator, which aggregates the output of processors 1 and 2 and generates additional elements such as glossaries, illustrative images, and document summaries.",
        "The system, named Open Book, is deployed as an editing tool for healthcare and educational service providers.",
        "It functions semi-automatically, exploiting the three processors and requiring the user to authorise the application of the conversion operations.",
        "The system is required to assess the readability of texts, not only to decide which texts should be converted, but also to assess the readability of texts that are undergoing conversion.",
        "It is expected that people working to improve the accessibiity of a given text will benefit from relevant feedback concerning the effects of the changes being introduced.",
        "Automatic assessment of readability is one method by which such feedback can be delivered.",
        "In the 6 http://www.cs.columbia.edu/ noemie/alignment/ 7 Available at: http://www.first-asd.eu/?q=system/files/FIRST D7.2 20130228 annex.pdf 8 www.first-asd.eu 54 context of improving the accessibility of texts, relevant feedback should indicate the extent to which different versions of a text meet the particular requirements of intended readers.",
        "User requirements were obtained through consulatation of 94 subjects meeting the strict DSM-IV criteria for ASD and with IQ > 70.",
        "43 user requirements were derived and assigned a reference code.",
        "The requirements link linguistic phenomena to editing operations, such as deletion, explanation, or trans-formation, that will convert the text to a more accessible form.",
        "The linguistic phenomena of concern include instances of syntactic complexity such as long sentences containing more than 15 words (possi- bly containing multiple copulative coordinated clauses (UR301), subordinate adjective clauses (UR302), explicative clauses (UR303), non-initial adverbial clauses (UR307)), sentences containing passive verbs (UR313), rarely used conjunctions and antithetic conjuncts (UR304, UR305, UR306), uncommon synonyms of polysemic words (UR401, UR425, UR504, UR505, UR511), rarely-used symbols and punctuation marks (UR311), anaphors, words containing more than 7 characters, adjectives ending with -ly, long numerical expressions (UR417), negation (UR314), words more than 7 characters long and adverbs with suffix -ly (UR317-319), anaphors, including pronouns (UR418-420).",
        "Additional linguistic phenomena such as phraseological units (UR402, UR410, UR425, UR507), and non-lexicalised metaphors (UR422, UR508), were also found to pose obstacles to reading comprehension for people with ASD.",
        "At present, there is a scarcity of resources enabling accurate detection of these items.",
        "For this reason, changes in the prevalence of these items in original and converted versions of texts are not captured in this study.",
        "The full set of user requirements is detailed in Martos et al. (2013).",
        "More generally, it is infrequent linguistic phenomena that cause the greatest difficulty.",
        "3 Related Work There have been several studies analysing the existing TS corpora.",
        "However, their main focus was on determining necessary transformations in TS: for children (Bautista et al., 2011); for people with intellectual disability (Drndarevi?c and Saggion, 2012); for language learners (Petersen and Ostendorf, 2007); and for people with low literacy (Gasperin et al., 2009).",
        "Unfortunately, those studies are not directly comparable (neither among themselves nor with our study), either because they focus on different types of transformations (the study of Bautista et al. (2011) focuses on general transformations while the other three studies focus on sentence transformations), or because they treat different languages (Spanish, English, and Brazilian Portuguese).",

        "Stajner et al. (2013).",
        "Napoles and Dredze (2010) built a statistical classification system that discriminates simple English from ordinary English, based on EW?SEW corpus.",
        "They used four different groups of features: lexical, part-of-speech, surface, and syntactic parse features.",
        "The accuracy of the best classifier (SVM) on the document classification task when using all features was 99.90%, while the accuracy of the best classifier (maximum entropy) on the sentence classification task when using all features was 80.80%.",
        "However, this study only demonstrated that it is fairly easy to discriminate sentences and documents of EW from those of SEW.",
        "It did not investigate whether the simple English used in SEW complies with the user requirements of any specific population with reading difficulties.",
        "?",
        "Stajner et al. (2013) analysed a corpus of 37 newswire texts in Spanish and their manual simplifications aimed at people with Down's syndrome, compiled in the Simplext project 9 .",
        "They built a classification system that discriminates the original texts from those which are simple with an F-measure of 1.00 using the SVM, and only seven features: average number of punctuation marks (not counting end of sentence markers), numerical expressions, average word length in characters, the ratio of simple and complex sentences, sentence complexity index, lexical density and lexical richness.",
        "They reported the average sentence length as being the feature with the best discriminative power, leading to an F-measure of 0.99 when used on its own.",
