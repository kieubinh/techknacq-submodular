        "This study examines the processing of noun-noun compounds by native and non-native speakers of English.",
        "Compounds have been extensively studied in the past 40 years from a myriad of viewpoints (Libben and Jarema, 2006; Lieber and ?tekauer, 2009).",
        "A key concern has been whether the processing of compounds consists in retrieving entities listed in the mind (Butterworth, 1983) or requires decomposition into constituents listed separately (Semenza et al., 1997; Libben, 1998).",
        "Dual-routes theories contend that the two processes exist side by side (Sandra, 1990).",
        "It is now widely accepted that both constituents are activated during processing, at least in non-lexicalised compounds (Jarema, 2006; Zhang et al., 2012).",
        "Noun-noun compounds have also been shown to be processed differently to non-compounds of similar morphological complexity and length, with compounds yielding longer reaction times and different electrophysiological correlates (El Yagoubi et al., 2008).",
        "Endocentric compounds contain a head element (dust in (1)) whose lexical category and interpretive features are inherited by the compound and contribute the core of its meaning (e.g. a kind of dust).",
        "The other element acts as a modifier of that head.",
        "(1) moon dust (?dust from the moon /dust made of moon /dust with moon-like properties?)",
        "Here we focus on endocentric noun-noun compounds (henceforth NNCs), which have been argued to embody an underlying structure (Libben, 2006) that is hierarchical, involving the (possibly recursive) subordination of a modifier to a grammatical head (or a modifier-head compound, as in (2)), with head-directionality that mirrors that of other noun-complement structures in the same language (Zipser, 2013).",
        "(2) [child [amateur [puppet theatre]]] ",
        "41 Headedness plays a specific role in the processing of NNCs, as demonstrated by research on Italian (which crucially features the two word orders in NNCs).",
        "Based on a lexical decision task, El Yagoubi et al. (2008) found priming effects induced by the head, independently of its position in the NNC.",
        "Headedeness effects are not distinguishable from position-in-the-string effects in languages such as English.",
        "For instance, Jarema et al. (1999) observed no difference in the priming of NNCs by the head or the modifier.",
        "Here we take this line of research further, by investigating whether headedness in the mothertongue affects the processing of transparent, irreversible NNCs in highly advanced second language learners of English.",
        "Event-related potentials (ERPs) can provide insight into the neural activity associated with the processing of compounds.",
        "Functional interpretations can be inferred from the temporal and spatial characteristics of electromagnetic activity, and ERP components can sometimes reveal the engagement of the cognitive processes involved.",
        "Our approach is this paper is exploratory (Otten and Rugg, 2005) and will focus on identifying differences in the amplitude of the EEG signal that can be traced back to properties of the participants (such as their language background) and properties of the compounds (such as their frequency of occurrence, and the frequencies of occurrence of their constituents).",
        "Inferences based on previously identified ERP components will be drawn in the discussion as appropriate.",
        "Our research questions are: (i) Does non-native processing of NNCs result in different ERP signatures to native processing?",
        "(ii) Is non-native processing of NNCs affected by headedness effects from the mothertongue?",
        "2 Materials and methods We registered the electrophysiological response of the brain to visual stimuli presented in the context of a (masked) primed lexical decision task.",
        "Stimuli were irreversible NNCs presented in licit (3-a) and reversed order (3-b).",
        "(3) a. coal dust b. #dust coal The participant groups differed in mothertongue: English (control group), Spanish or German (exper- imental groups).",
        "Like English, German features productive compounding, with a head-last structure.",
        "Whereas in Spanish, compounds are essentially head-first, and not productive.",
        "2.1 Participants Ten native British English speakers (4 female, mean age 22;11 years; STD 3;3 years), ten native German learners of English (7 female, mean age 26;5 years; STD 5;7 years) and ten native Spanish learners of English (3 female, mean age 26;11 years; STD 5;3 years) took part in the study.",
        "Participants all had initial second-language exposure after 8 years of age, and all scored above 60% on a cloze test from the Cambridge Certificate in Advanced English.",
        "All were right-handed based on the Briggs and Nebes inventory (Briggs and Nebes, 1975), had no speech or language difficulties and had normal or corrected-to normal vision.",
        "2.2 Stimuli Experimental stimuli consisted of prime-target pairs, presented in 4 experimental conditions in a 3 (Group) x 2 (Prime Condition) x 2 (Word Order) design.",
        "The prime was either the head (e.g. dust in (3)) or the modifier (e.g. coal in (3)) of the intended compound.",
        "The Word Order factor had 2 levels: licit (modifier - head, as in (3-a)) or reversed (head - modifier, as in (3-b)).",
        "All the NNCs were endocentric and featured a transparent, modification relationship.",
        "All 42 items were tested for irreversibility on an independent group of 30 native speakers.",
        "The frequency of the licit compounds and their constituent nouns was estimated from the post-1990 data in Google N-grams.",
        "To avoid lexicalisation effects, only compounds with very low frequencies were included (i.e. below 3,300 ?",
        "mean = 359.5, compared with a mean of 279,300 for the constituent nouns).",
        "There was a total of 480 test items (based on 120 compounds), of which 240 are included in the present study (as we focus on the Head Prime condition only).",
        "The items were pseudo-randomised into 8 different orders (assigned randomly to participants) and presented in 4 blocks, with a rest in between.",
        "2.3 Procedure Participants were tested individually in a single session lasting approximately 1.5 hours.",
        "Stimuli were presented visually in light grey text on a black background.",
        "Each trial began with the visual presentation of a series of exclamation marks (!!!)",
        "for 1000 ms, which was a signal for the participant to rest their eyes and blink After a delay of 100 ms a fixation point (+) was presented for 250 ms to signal that the trial was about to begin.",
        "After a 100 ms mask (#######), the prime was presented for 100 ms followed by a second mask (for 50 ms) and the target (for 1000 ms).",
        "After a delay of 500 ms a question mark (?)",
        "appeared for 2000 ms during which time participants had to make a lexical decision about the target (as acceptable or not) by pressing (with their right hand) one of two buttons on a hand-held button box (counterbalanced across participants).",
        "Participants were instructed to respond as accurately as possible; accuracy and reaction times (in ms from the onset of the ??\")",
        "were recorded.",
        "After the response (or at the end of 2000 ms if the participant did not respond), there was a delay of 100 ms before the next trial started.",
        "The experimental session was preceded by a practice session comprising 20 trials, which was repeated until participants could perform the task and procedure with no errors (usually one or two practice sessions sufficed).",
        "The EEG was recorded (Neuroscan Synamps2) from 60 Ag/AgCl electrodes embedded in a cap based on the extended version of the International 10-20 positioning system (Sharbrough et al., 1991).",
        "Additional electrodes were placed on the left and right mastoids.",
        "Data were recorded using a central reference electrode placed between Cz and CPz.",
        "The ground electrode was positioned between Fz and Fpz.",
        "To capture noise articfacts in the EEG signal due to eye movements, electro-oculograms (EOGs) were recorded using electrodes positioned at either side of the eyes, and above and below the left eye.",
        "At the beginning of the experiment electrode impedances were below 10 k?.",
        "The analogue EEG and EOG recordings were amplified (band pass filter 0.1 to 100Hz), and continuously digitised (32-bit) at a sampling frequency of 500 Hz.",
        "Data were processed offline using Neuroscan Edit 4.3 software (Compumedics Neuroscan) and filtered (0.1-40Hz, 96 dB/Oct, Butterworth zero phase filter).",
        "The effect of eye-blink artifacts was minimised by estimating and correcting their contribution to the EEG using a regression procedure which involves calculating an average blink from 32 blinks for each participant, and removing the contribution of the blink from all other channels on a point-by-point basis.",
        "Data were epoched between -100 and 1100 ms relative to the onset of the experimental targets and baseline-corrected by subtracting the mean amplitude over the pre-stimulus interval.",
        "Epochs were rejected if participants did not make a response within the allocated time (during presentation of the ??",
        "\"), or if they made an incorrect response.",
        "Subsequently the data was downsampled to 125 Hz.",
        "Trial rejection was not done a priori but based on the residuals of the modelling, resulting in only 0.7% of discarded data.",
        "43 3 Results 3.1 Accuracy analysis The responses on the lexical decision task were analysed with a generalised linear mixed-effect model with a binomial link function, using the lme4 package, version 1.0-4 (Bates et al., 2013) with the ?bobyqa?",

        "First, GAMMs are optimized for dealing with non-linear functional relations between a response (here, the amplitude) 44 and one or more numerical predictors (resulting in wiggly curves, wiggly surfaces, or, in the case of more than two predictors, wiggly hypersurfaces).",
        "Second, GAMMs decompose the EEG amplitude into a sequence of additive components, thereby affording the analyst a toolkit for separating out partial effects due to different kinds of predictors (e.g., language group, time, compound frequency, constituent frequency).",
        "Third, GAMMs can capture AR1 autocorrelative processes in the signal, and therefore protect against anti-conservative p-values and mistakingly taking noise for complex EPR signatures (as has been shown to occur by Tanner et al., 2013).",

        "Knowledge of whether a two-word combination is in fact licit in English can arise from two sources.",
        "On the one hand, speakers may be familiar with the compound, as evidenced by an effect of compound frequency.",
        "For the native English speakers resonding to licit compounds, an effect of compound fre-48 quency was indeed present in the EEG amplitudes.",
        "On the other hand, speakers may infer the intended meaning from the constituents (e.g., English beach ball indexing German Wasserball, ?water ball?).",
        "Constituent effects were well attested in the EEG amplitudes.",
        "Interestingly, for English speakers, constituent frequency effects gave rise to more positive amplitudes in the licit condition (significantly at neighboring channels) whereas in the reversed condition, amplitudes were more negative for higher-frequency constituents.",
        "In other words, when English speakers are confronted with reversed com-pounds, which for them are actually novel compounds, the compound frequency effect disappears, and a constituent frequency effect emerges that is opposite in sign to that for normal compounds.",
        "Of the non-native speakers of English, only the Spanish speakers revealed a compound frequency effect, with a slope opposite in sign to that for the English speakers.",
        "If higher amplitude in the signal indicates increased processing effort, the effect of the frequency of the intended compound could be interpreted as facilitating in the Licit Word Order condition in the native speakers but inhibiting in the Spanish group (and without much effect in the German group).",
        "We hypothesize that Spanish speakers find licit English compounds more difficult precisely because in their native language, the order of the constituents would have been reversed.",
        "It is only these speakers that have a word order conflict to resolve.",
        "All speakers (non-native as well as English) responding to reversed (i.e., for them, novel) compounds, show more negative amplitudes for compounds with higher constituent frequencies.",
        "We interpret this as evidence for constituent-driven, decompositional processing.",
        "The especially pronounced negativities for Spanish speakers in the Licit Word Order context (which go hand in hand with a positive slope for compound frequency) suggest that for these speakers increased processing resources are called upon to resolve the conflict between English and Spanish constituent order, in spite of native-like performance in the evaluation of compounds in that condition.",
        "A positive peak around 300 ms post-stimulus was found in all groups in both conditions, and exacerbated in the Spanish group in the Licit Word Order condition.",
        "This peak could be interpreted as a P300, indexing attentional resources.",
        "El Yagoubi et al. (2008) found that right-headed NNCs in Italian yielded a greater P300 and interpreted this as evidence that processing this marked (but in Italian equally grammatical) word order required increased attentional resources.",
        "If the P300 observed here reflects a peak of attentional engagement, we expect its amplitude to predict scores on an Attention Network Task (Fan et al., 2005) ?",
        "something we will investigate in the next phase of this study.",
        "With respect to the absence of a significant N400 effect between the Word Order conditions, we first note that the N400 may vanish due to familiarization, and also to masked priming (Coulson et al., 2005; Brown and Hagoort, 1993).",
        "However, and perhaps more importantly, reversed compounds are not semantically anomalous.",
        "To the contrary, they invite interpretation and, as we have documented, give rise to constituent-driven processes of interpretation.",
        "From this perspective, an N400 would then characterize the processing of semantic anomalies that cannot be resolved through morphological processing.",
        "5 Concluding remarks This study set out to investigate (i) whether non-native processing of NNCs results in different ERP signatures compared to native processing, and (ii) whether non-native processing of NNCs is affected by constituent order in the mothertongue.",
        "Analysis of the EEG amplitudes revealed that English native speakers read licit compounds using both whole-word information (as indexed by compound frequency) in congruence with constituent information (as indexed by constituent frequency with a positive effect) whereas non-native speakers and English speakers reading novel (reversed) compounds resort to decompositional interpretation indexed by a negative effect on amplitudes.",
        "Further-49 more, Spanish readers undergo interference from the different constituent order possibilities in their own language, leading to a reversed compound frequency effect and strongly enhanced constituent frequency effects (with a negative sign) when reading English licit compounds.",
        "This pattern of results is, for native speakers, consistent with the early effects of compound frequency observed using eye-tracking by, e.g., Kuperman et al. (2008, 2009) and Miwa et al. (2014) for English, Finnish, and Japanese respectively.",
        "The importance of constituent-driven processing for non-native speakers is reminiscent of the decompositional eye-movement patterns of less-proficient readers reported by Kuperman & Van Dyke (2011).",
        "We conclude with noting that the insights gleaned from the EEG amplitudes would not have been possible without generalized additive mixed models.",
        "At the same time, we believe we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg.",
        "For instance, the model can be improved by allowing the interaction of the constituent frequencies by group and constituent order to vary with time, using a five-way tensor product smooth.",
        "Two considerations have withheld us from following up on this considerably more complex model.",
        "First, without specific hypotheses as a guide, interpretation becomes extremely difficult.",
        "Second, we are concerned that with a relative small number of compounds (120), overfitting might become an issue.",
        "For future research specifically addressing the development over time of constituent (and whole-word) frequency effects, we recommend designs with larger numbers of compounds.",
