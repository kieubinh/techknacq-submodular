        "In German, as in many other languages, two (or more) simplex words can be combined to form a compound.",
        "This is a productive process, leading to a potentially infinite number of sound German compounds.",
        "As a consequence, many NLP applications suffer from coverage issues for compounds which do not appear or appear only infrequently in language resources.",
        "However, while many compounds are not covered, their component words are often found in lexical resources or training data.",
        "Compound processing allows access to these component words and thus can overcome these sparsity issues.",
        "We use Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) as an example application for compound processing.",
        "Our SMT system translates from German to English, where compounds are usually split in the German source language prior to training and decoding.",
        "The benefits are obvious: vocabulary size is reduced and the languages are adjusted in terms of granularity, as exemplified by the compound Holzzaun.",
        "This fencewoodenHolzzaun HolzZaun woodenfence 1:1 alignment1:n alignment results in better alignment quality and model estimation.",
        "Compound splitting also enables the translation of compounds not occurring in the parallel data, if the parts have been seen and can thus be translated individually.",
        "However, these assumptions only hold for compositional compounds like Holzzaun (?wooden fence?",
        "), whose meanings can be derived from the meanings of their constituents, namely Holz (?wood?)",
        "and Zaun (?fence?).",
        "In contrast, the splitting of non-compositional compounds may lead to translation errors: e.g. the meaning of J?agerzaun (?lattice fence?)",
        "cannot be represented by the meanings of its constituents J?ager (?hunter?)",
        "and Zaun (?fence?).",
        "Here, an erroneous splitting of the compound can lead to wrong generalizations or translation pairs, such as J?ager ?",
        "lattice, in the absence of other evidence about how to translate J?ager.",
        "When splitting compounds for SMT, two important factors should thus be considered: (1) whether a compound is compositional and should be split, and if so (2) how the compound should be split.",
        "Most previous approaches mainly focused on the second task, how to split a compound, e.g. using frequency statistics (Koehn and Knight, 2003) or a rule-based morphology (Fritzinger and Fraser, 2010), and all of them showed improved SMT quality for compound splitting.",
        "The decision about whether the compound is compositional and should be split at all has not received much attention in the past.",
        "In this work, we examine the effect of only splitting compositional compounds, in contrast to splitting all compounds.",
        "To this end, we combine (A) an approach relying on the distributional similarity between compounds and their constituents, to predict the degree of compositionality and thus to determine whether to split the compound with (B) a combination of morphological and frequency-based features This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "81 to determine how to split a compound.",
        "We experiment with this novel semantically-informed compound splitting on the source-side data of a German-English SMT system.",
        "As far as we know, we are the first to study the impact of compositionality-aware compound splitting in SMT.",
        "We evaluate our systems on a standard and on a specifically created test set, both for noun compounds and particle verbs.",
        "Our results show that phrase-based SMT is generally robust with regard to over-splitting non-compositional compounds, with the exception of low-frequency words.",
        "This is in line with corresponding assumptions from previous work.",
        "Furthermore, we present a small-scale study about the translational behaviour of non-compositional compounds, which can surprisingly often be translated component-wise.",
        "2 Related Work We combine morphology-based compound splitting with distributional semantics to improve phrase-based SMT.",
        "Here, we discuss relevant work of compound splitting in SMT and distributional semantics.",
        "2.1 Compound Splitting in SMT Compound splitting in SMT is a well-studied task.",
        "There is a wide range of previous work, including purely string- and frequency-based approaches, but also linguistically-informed approaches.",
        "All lines of research improved translation performance due to compound splitting.",
        "In Koehn and Knight (2003), compounds are split through the identification of substrings from a corpus.",
        "The splitting is performed without linguistic knowledge (except for the insertion of the filler letters ?(e)s?",
        "), which necessarily leads to many erroneous splittings.",
        "Multiple possible splitting options are disambiguated using the frequencies of the substrings.",
        "Starting from Koehn and Knight (2003), Stymne (2008) covers more morphological transformations and imposes POS constraints on the subwords.",
        "Nie?en and Ney (2000) and Fritzinger and Fraser (2010) perform compound splitting by relying on morphological analysers to identify suitable split points.",
        "This has the advantage of returning only linguistically motivated splitting options, but the analyses are often ambiguous and require disambiguation: Nie?en and Ney (2000) use a parser for context-sensitive disambiguation, and Fritzinger and Fraser (2010) use corpus frequencies to find the best split for each compound.",
        "Other approaches use a two-step word alignment process: first, word alignment is performed on a split representation of the compounding language.",
        "Then, all former compound parts for which there is no aligned counterpart in the non-compounding language are merged back to the compound again.",
        "Finally, word alignment is re-run on this representation.",
        "See Koehn and Knight (2003) for experiments on German, DeNeefe et al. (2008) for Arabic and Bai et al. (2008) for Chinese.",
        "This blocks non-compositional compounds from being split if they are translated as one simplex English word in the training data (e.g. Heckensch?utze, lit.",
        "?hedge|shooter?",
        "; ?sniper?)",
        "and aligned correctly.",
        "However, cases like J?agerzaun, ?lattice fence?",
        "are not covered.",
        "In the present work, we identify compounds with a morphological analyser, disambiguated with corpus frequencies.",
        "Moreover, we restrict splitting to compositional compounds using distributional semantics.",
        "We are not aware of any previous work that takes semantics into account for compound splitting in SMT.",
        "2.2 Distributional Semantics and Compounding Distributional information has been a steadily increasing, integral part of lexical semantic research over the past 20 years.",
        "Based on the distributional hypothesis (Firth, 1957; Harris, 1968) that ?you shall know a word by the company it keeps?, distributional semantics exploits the co-occurrence of words in corpora to explore the meanings and the similarities of the words, phrases, sentences, etc.",
        "of interest.",
        "Among many other tasks, distributional semantic information has been utilised to determine the degree of compositionality (or: semantic transparency) of various types of compounds, most notably regarding noun compounds (e.g., Zinsmeister and Heid (2004), Reddy et al. (2011), Schulte im Walde et al. (2013), Salehi et al. (2014)) and particle verbs (e.g., McCarthy et al. (2003), Bannard (2005), Cook and Stevenson (2006), K?uhner and Schulte im Walde (2010), Bott and Schulte im Walde (2014), Salehi et al. (2014)).",
        "Typically, these approaches rely on co-occurrence information from a corpus (either referring to bags-of-words, or focusing on target-specific types of features), and compare the distributional features of the compounds with those of the constituents, in order to predict the degree of compositionality of the 82 OutputInput Preprocessing Step 1: Identify Component Words Similarity ScoresStep 2: Predict sitional CompoundsStep 3: Split Compo?",

        "compound.",
        "The underlying assumption is that a compound which is similar in meaning to a constituent (as in Holzzaun?Zaun (?wooden fence???fence?)",
        "but not in L?owenzahn?Zahn (?lion|tooth (dandelion)??",
        "?tooth?))",
        "is also similar to the constituent with regard to co-occurrence information.",
        "Most related to this work on noun compounds, Reddy et al. (2011) relied on window-based distributional models to predict the compositionality of English noun compounds, and Schulte im Walde et al. (2013) compared window-based against syntax-based distributional models to predict the compositionality of German noun compounds.",
        "Zinsmeister and Heid (2004) used subcategorising verbs to predict compound?head similarities of German noun compounds.",
        "Most recently, Salehi et al. (2014) extended the previous approaches to take multi-lingual co-occurrence information into account, regarding English and German noun compounds, and English particle verbs.",
        "3 Methodology We integrate our semantically-informed compound splitting as a pre-processing step to the German source language of an SMT system.",
        "See Figure 1 for an illustration of our compound processing pipeline.",
        "3.1 Target Compounds German compounds are combinations of two (or more) simplex words.",
        "In some cases, a morphological transformation is required: for example, when combining the two nouns Ausflug (?excursion?)",
        "and Ziel (?destination?)",
        "?",
        "Ausflugsziel (?excursion destination?",
        "), a filler letter (here: ?s?)",
        "needs to be inserted.",
        "Other such transformations include more filler letters or the deletion/substitution of letters.",
        "Noun compounds are formed of a head noun and a modifier, which can consist of nouns, verbs, adjectives or proper nouns.",
        "Particle verbs are productive compositions of a base verb and a prefix particle, whose part-of-speech varies between open-class nouns, adjectives, and verbs, and closed-class prepositions and adverbs.",
        "In comparison to noun compounds, the constituents of German particle verbs exhibit a much higher degree of ambiguity: Verbs in general are more ambiguous than nouns, and the largest sub-class of particles (those with a preposition particle) is highly ambiguous by itself (e.g. Lechler and Ro?deutscher (2009) and Springorum (2011)).",
        "For example, in anknabbern (?to nibble partially?",
        "), the particle an expresses a partitive meaning , whereas in ankleben (?to glue onto sth.?)",
        "an has a topological meaning (to glue sth.",
        "onto an implicit background).",
        "In addition, particle verb senses may be transparent or opaque with respect to their base verbs.",
        "For example, abholen ?fetch?",
        "is rather transparent with respect to its base verb holen ?fetch?, whereas anfangen ?begin?",
        "is more opaque with respect to fangen ?catch?.",
        "In contrast, einsetzen has both transparent (e.g.",
        "?insert?)",
        "and opaque (e.g.",
        "?begin?)",
        "verb senses with respect to setzen ?put/sit (down)?.",
        "The high degree of ambiguity makes particle verbs a challenge for NLP.",
        "Moreover, particle and base verb can occur separately (er f?angt an: ?he begins?)",
        "or in one word (dass er anf?angt: ?that he begins?",
        "), depending on the clausal type.",
        "This makes consistent treatment of particle verbs difficult.",
        "3.2 Identification of Component Parts We use the rule-based morphological analyser SMOR (Schmid et al., 2004) to identify compounds and their constituents in our parallel training data (cf.",
        "Section 4).",
        "It relies on a large lexicon of word lemmas and feature rules for productive morphological processes in German, i.e., compounding, derivation and 83 inflection.",
        "In this paper, we will not consider splitting into derivational affixes (as needed for, e.g., Arabic and Turkish), but instead identify simplex words that may also occur independently.",
        "Moreover, we only keep noun compounds and particle verbs consisting of two constituents.",
        "The resulting set consists of 93,299 noun compound types and 3,689 particle verb types.",
        "3.3 Predicting Compositionality based on Distributional Similarity Starting from this set of compounds as derived from our parallel training data, we collected distributional co-occurrence information from two large German web corpora and the machine translation training data: (i) the German COW corpus (Sch?afer and Bildhauer (2012), ?9 billion words), (ii) the SdeWaC (Faa?",
        "and Eckart (2013), ?880 million words), (iii) our MT parallel corpus (?40 million words) and (iv) MT language model training data (?146 million words).",
        "We relied on earlier work and used the 20,000 most frequent nouns from the SdeWaC as co-occurrence features, looking into a window of 20 words to the left and to the right of our target compounds and their constituents.",
        "We thus obtained a co-occurrence matrix of all compounds and their constituents with the 20,000 selected nouns.",
        "As co-occurrence strength (i.e., how strong is a co-occurrence between a target word and a co-occurring noun), we collected frequencies and transformed them into local mutual information (LMI) values, cf. Evert (2005).",
        "Finally, we calculated the distributional similarity between the compounds and their constituents, relying on the standard measure cosine.",
        "The cosine value is then used to predict the degree of compositionality between the respective compound?constituent pairs.",
        "For example, the cosine value of the pair Baumschule?Baum 1 is 0.38, while the cosine value of the pair Baumschule?Schule is only 0.01.",
        "3.4 Semantically-Informed Compound Splitting In the two preceding sections, we described how we identified component words and calculated distributional compositionality scores for all of the compounds found in our training data.",
        "Here, we give details on how we include the semantic information into the compound splitting process.",
        "Recall that we only want to split compositional compounds and keep non-compositional compounds together.",
        "The splitting decision (to split/not split a compound) is based on the compositionality score of the compound that takes into account either one or both of the compound?constituent cosine values: if the predicted degree of compositionality is high, the compound is split.",
        "We consider and combine four different criteria: i) only the compound?modifier similarity (mod); (ii) only the compound?head similarity (head); a combination of the compound?modifier and the compound?head similarities, relying on (iii) the geometric mean (geom) or (iv) on the arithmetic mean (arith).",
        "We used different thresholds for each of these criteria throughout our experiments, with a specific focus on distinguishing the contributions of the modifiers vs. the heads in the splitting decision, following insights from recent work in psycholinguistic studies (Gagn?e and Spalding, 2009; Gagn?e and Spalding, 2011) as well as in computational approaches on noun compounding (Reddy et al., 2011; Schulte im Walde et al., 2013).",
        "Furthermore, we compare the effects of splitting with regard to two types of compounds, noun compounds and particle verbs: Both types are very productive and can generate a potentially infinite number of new forms.",
        "4 Experimental Setting This section gives an overview on the technical details of the SMT system and our data sets.",
        "Compound splitting is applied to all source-language data, i.e. the parallel data used to train the model, as well as the input for parameter tuning and testing.",
        "2 Translation Model Moses is a state-of-the-art toolkit for phrase-based SMT systems (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "We use it with default settings to train a translation model and we do so separately for each of the different compound splittings.",
        "Word alignment is performed using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "Feature weights are tuned using Batch-Mira (Cherry and Foster, 2012) with ?-safe-hope?",
        "until convergence.",
        "Training Data Our parallel training data contains the Europarl corpus (version 4, cf. Koehn (2005)) and also newspaper texts, overall ca. 1.5 million sentences 3 (roughly 44 million words).",
        "In addition, we 1 Baum|schule: ?tree|school?",
        "(tree nursery) 2 Compounds not contained in the parallel data are always split, as they cannot be translated otherwise.",
        "3 Data from the shared task of the EACL 2009 workshop on statistical machine translation: www.statmt.org/wmt09 84 use an English corpus of roughly 227 million words (including the English part of the parallel data) to build a target-side 5-gram language model with SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) in combination with KENLM (Heafield, 2011).",
        "For parameter tuning, we use 1,025 sentences of news data.",
        "Standard Test set 1,026 sentences of news data (test set from the 2009 WMT Shared Task): this set is to measure the translation quality on a standard SMT test and make it comparable to other work.",
        "Noun/Verb Test set As our main focus lies on sentences containing compounds, we created a second test set which is rich in compounds.",
        "From the combined 2008-2013 Shared Task test sets, we extracted all sentences containing at least one noun compound for which we have compound-constituent similarity scores.",
        "Moreover, we excluded sentences containing nouns that are not in the parallel training data: such compounds can only be translated when split which allows to translate their components.",
        "The final test set consists of 2,574 sentences.",
        "Similarly, we also created a set rich in particle verbs (855 sentences).",
        "Opaque Test set As the two first test sets mainly contain compositional compounds, we use a third test set consisting of sentences with only non-compositional compounds.",
        "The underlying compounds were chosen based on a list containing noun compounds and human ratings for compositionality (von der Heide and Borgwaldt (2009)).",
        "As before, the compounds must have occurred in the parallel data.",
        "The result is a list of 14 compounds, of which 11 have a low modifier-compound similarity and 3 have a low head-compound similarity.",
        "We then extracted sentences containing these compounds (5 per compound = 70 in total) from German newspaper data 4 .",
        "In contrast to the other sets, we use this test set in a qualitative study, to approximate the translation quality by counting the number of correctly translated compounds.",
        "5 SMT Results In this section, we present and discuss the results of our machine translation experiments.",
        "We first report results for two test sets in terms of a standard evaluation metric (BLEU) and then continue with a small-scale qualitative study on the translational behaviour of non-compositional compounds.",

        "Inconsistent Splitting Compositionality is a continuum rather than a binary decision, with the scores of many (compositional) compounds being in the medium range.",

        "In conclusion, while phrase-based SMT is often able to recover from over-splitting by translating a word sequence as a phrase, this is not always necessary for opaque compounds as they can have a literal or near-literal translation.",

        "We experimented with different threshold/score combinations on a standard and a specifically created test set.",
        "Our results indicate that phrase-based SMT is very robust with regard to over-splitting non-compositional noun compounds, with the exception of low-frequency compounds.",
        "Furthermore, we studied the translational behaviour of non-compositional compounds with a special focus on the fact that non-compositional compounds can in some cases be translated component-wise, leading to the conclusion that a monolingual estimation of compositionality is not sufficient for an optimal explicit handling of compounds in SMT applications.",
        "The relatively low impact of distinguishing the degree of compositionality might also be due to the fact that the task of translating noun compounds can be considered ?easy?, as the split components always occur adjacently.",
        "In contrast, handling other types of non-compositional structures (e.g. noun-verb or preposition-noun-verb combinations which are non-compositional) is a challenging task for future work.",
