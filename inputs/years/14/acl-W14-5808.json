        "of the AMR specification clearly states that AMR is not an interlingua, yet it is expected that many relations as well as structures constructed from these relations will be similar or even identical across languages.",

        "4.2 Analysis of Differences The main goal of this study is to analyze differences in the annotation for the two languages, Czech and English, and determine if a reconciliation of the annotation is possible or not (and for what reason it is / it is not).",
        "Based on the above quantitative analysis, we have concentrated on relation labeling differences due their high proportion, and on structural differences due to their heterogeneous nature.",
        "The differences in reference annotation are small, but this is due to the lack of full referential annotation (it has been done for events, but only assumed for other types of entities due to the lack of ontology, or better to say due to the lack of ?wikification?",
        "annotation in both languages), rather than due to high agreement.",
        "We will come back to this once wikification of the annotation is finished.",

        "58 4.3 Differences in Relation Labeling The differences in function labeling should be taken with a grain of salt.",
        "The crucial question is what should count as a difference in relation labeling if the structure differs should this be automatically counted as a difference, or not at all?",
        "In the figures summarized in Table 1, we have taken a middle ground: if the structural difference implied a change in labeling by itself, we have not counted that difference in order not to ?penalize?",
        "the sentence annotation twice.",
        "More detailed inspection of relation labeling differences, which appear to be relatively frequent at more than 1/4th of all nodes in the annotation, revealed that the by far most frequent mismatch is caused by different argument labeling for events.",
        "4 While for most purely transitive verbs there is a complete match, for most other there is a discrepancy due to the attempted semanticization of PDT-Vallex argument labels ADDR (addressee), EFF (effect) and ORIG (origin), while PropBank simply continues to number arguments of corresponding verbs consecutively (for example, I thought there is.ARG1 ... vs. Myslel/I-thought jsem, ?ze/that tam/there je.ARG3?EFF/is ...).",
        "The concept of ?shifting?",
        "in PDT-Vallex, which compulsorily fills the first two arguments on syntactic grounds as ACT(ARG0) and PAT(ARG1) is another source of differences.",
        "Furthermore, PropBank leaves out ARG0 e.g. for unaccusative verbs (for example The window.ARG1 broke vs. Okno.ARG0?ACT/window se/itself rozbilo/broke.).",
        "Finally, some differences are due to some arguments not being considered arguments at all in the other language, in which case some other AMR label is used instead (for example, We could have spent 400M.ARG3 ... elsewhere vs. ... mohli/could utratit/spend 400M.extent ... jinde/elsewhere).",
        "These differences could possibly be consolidated (only) by carefully linking the two lexicons (with AMR guidelines intact).",
        "This is in fact being performed in another project (Sindlerova et al., 2014), but it is a daunting manual task, since the underlying theories behind PropBank and PDT-Vallex/EngVallex differ.",
        "However, one has to ask if it does make sense to do so, because with enough parallel data available, the mappings can be learned relatively easily: in most cases, no structural differences are involved and there will be a simple one-to-one mapping between the labels (conditioned on the particular verb sense).",
        "4.4 Structural Differences Local differences can be safely ignored, since they will be in most cases resolved during the assumed process of wikification, i.e., linking to an ontology concept.",
        "For example, the abbreviation VDOT (Vir- ginia Department of Transportation), which has to be (and was) translated into Czech in an explanatory way (otherwise the sentence would become not quite understandable, if only because of the real-world context).",
        "Without wikification, it could not be linked as a whole, and thus a subgraph has been created with the AMR-appropriate internal semantic relations in the translation (e.g. Virginia.location, etc.).",
        "Certain differences, albeit ?localized?",
        "into a small subtree (or subgraph) corresponding to a single node or another small subtree (subgraph), cannot be resolved by wikification of a different event ontology (than PropBank or PDT-Vallex).",
        "For example, light verb constructions or even certain modal or aspectual constructions could have a single verb equivalent resulting in two node vs. single node annotation: get close vs.",
        "p?ribl??",
        "?zit-se, make worse vs. zhor?sit, take position (for sb) vs. zast?avat-se or causing sprawl vs. roztahuje-se.",
        "Looking at the true structural differences, we have found that there are actually quite a few reasons for them to appear in the annotation.",
        "We will describe them in more detail below.",
        "Non-literal translation is the primary reason for such differences.",
        "5 For example, destination vs. kam/where-to lid?e/people jezd?",
        "?/drive (Fig. 4), or job center vs.",
        "m?",
        "?sto/place, kde/where pracuje/work hodn?e/many lid?",
        "?/people; these cases cannot be unified neither by changing the translation to a more literal one (because it would be strongly misleading in the given context, despite the fact that literal translation of both destination as well as job center does exist in Czech), neither by changing the guidelines, since the level of abstraction of AMR does not call for a unification of such concepts.",
        "Sometimes, non-literal 4 The Czech PDT-Vallex argument labels have been mapped to PropBank labels as follows: ACT?",
        "ARG0, PAT?",
        "ARG1, ADDR?",
        "ARG2, EFF?",
        "ARG3 and ORIG?",
        "ARG4.",
        "5 This includes also cases of truly wrong translation, stemming of translator's misunderstanding of the facts behind the sentence.",
        "This has been found fairly often only after we studied the differences in depth, since a superficial reading and standard translation revision procedure did not help.",
        "59 translation is forced upon the translation because no word-for-word translation exists, such as in in the aggregate, which has to be translated using an extra clause z/from celkov?eho/overall pohledu/view to/it je/is tak/so, ?ze/that ... (Fig. 5).",
        "Figure 4: AMR structural difference: destination vs. kam/where-to lid?e/people jezd?",
        "?/drive Phraseological differences and idioms form another large group of differences between the two languages.",
        "The possibility of changing the translation is even more remote than in the above case, even if we had the chance: the provided translation is actually the correct and perfect one.",
        "The reason for different annotation lies in the AMR scheme, which does not go that far to require ?unified?",
        "annotation in such cases where the idiom or specific phrase cannot be linked to the external ontology as a single unit.",
        "For example, English ?I don't see any point?",
        "is translated as ?nem?a/not-have smysl/purpose?, and despite the fact that have-purpose-91 is a specific event reference in English (and has been used in the anno-tation), the verb ?see?",
        "still remains annotated as a separate event node, which is not the case in Czech, since no ?seeing?",
        "is expressed in the sentence and it could hardly be asked for in the guidelines to be inserted.",
        "Similarly, I commute back and forth has been translated simply as doj???zd?",
        "?m/commute, which is semantically perfectly equivalent but the back and forth has been kept in the English annotation, because 60 Figure 5: AMR structural difference: in the aggregate vs. z/from celkov?eho/overall pohledu/view to/it je/is tak/so, ?ze/that ... deleting it was (probably) considered loss of information.",
        "It is only the confrontation with the translation to a different language when one realizes that with just a little more abstraction, the annotation could have been structurally the same (by keeping only the commute node in in the English annotation).",
        "6 Translation by interpretation is typically discouraged in translation school education, but sometimes it is necessary to use it for smooth understanding of the translated text.",
        "Often, such interpretation results in different AMR annotation.",
        "For example, Virginia centrist has been translated as st?redov?y/centrist voli?c/voter [z/from Virginie/Virginia], because without the extra word voli?c, the literal translation of centrist would not be understandable correctly in this context (Fig. 6).",
        "Similarly, a 55mph zone vs. z?ona/zone s/with omezen?",
        "?m/restriction na/to 55 mph (added word omezen?",
        "?m/restriction), or traffic vs.",
        "dopravn?",
        "?/traffic z?acpa/jam.",
        "Convention differences are inherent in many annotation schemes, and we have found them in AMR 6 One could perhaps also argue that adding the equivalent of back and forth to the Czech translation would unify the trans-lation, too; however, adding its literal equivalent in Czech tam a zp?et would be considered superfluous and unnatural by Czech speakers.",
        "61 Figure 6: AMR structural difference: Virginia Centrist vs. st?redov?y/centrist voli?c/voter [z/from Virginie/Virginia] Figure 7: AMR convention difference: auditor as a single node vs. person, who audits guidelines, too.",
        "Often, they were related to the use of ARG-of vs. keeping the nominalization as a single node.",
        "For example, for auditor, translated quite literally as auditor into Czech, has been annotated as ?a person, who audits?",
        "in English while in the Czech AMR structure, there is a single node (Fig. 7) labeled as auditor (which undoubtedly will be correctly linked to some ontology entry after such link-age/wikification is complete).",
        "These differences might be harder to consolidate, since such conventions are very difficult to create proper guidelines for, especially across languages.",
        "No ontology (whether for events or objects) will be complete either (to base the decisions on a particular ontology content).",
        "5 Conclusions and Future Work We have investigated differences in the annotation of parallel texts using the",
        "Abstract",
        "Meaning Representation scheme, on approx.",
        "1500 words of English-Czech corpus (100 sentences).",
        "We found and counted the number of identities and four types of differences (structural, structural local, relational, and referential), and exemplified them to see if a reconciliation (either by possibly changing the translation, the guidelines, or the annotation itself) is possible.",
        "This is a work in progress.",
        "Substantial amount of work remains.",
        "We will have to use larger data, multiple annotation (interannotator agreement on English was relatively low and we expect to be the case on Czech, too, once two annotators start annotating the same sentences), and we would also have to actually suggest changes in the guidelines or their conventions, and to test them also on substantial amounts of data.",
        "The immediate extension of this work will cover wikification, i.e. the linking of all nodes in the AMR representation of our dataset to some ontology: events are already covered, internally defined relations are already annotated, too (such as named entity types, dates, quantities, etc.",
        "), but external links remain to be added.",
        "We will not only use Wikipedia (as the term ?wikification?",
        "might suggest), but we will extend this idea also to other sources, such as DBpedia or BabelNet, keeping all links in parallel if possible.",
        "This should allow for deep comparison of the two languages also content-wise.",
        "We should then be able to better answer the question of annotation unification which does depend on these links rather than on the annotation guidelines themselves.",
        "Parallel AMR-annotated data will be used at the JHU 2014 Summer Workshop, where technology for AMR-based parsing, generation and possibly also MT will be developed, allowing also technological insight into the AMR scheme across languages.",
