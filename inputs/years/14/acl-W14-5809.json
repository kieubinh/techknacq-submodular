        "Around the 1980s the computational exploitation of machine-readable dictionaries (MRDs) for the automatic acquisition of lexical and semantic information enjoyed a great favor in NLP (Calzolari et al., 1973; Chodorow et al., 1985).",
        "MRDs' definitions provided robust and structured knowledge from which semantic relations were automatically extracted for linguistic studies (Markowitz et al., 1986) and linguistic resources development (Calzolari, 1988).",
        "Today the scenario has changed as corpora have become the main source for semantic knowledge acquisition.",
        "However, dictionaries are regaining some interest thanks to the availability of public domain dictionaries, especially Wiktionary.",
        "In the present work, we describe a method to create a morphosemantic and morphological French lexicon from Wiktionary's definitions.",
        "This type of large coverage resource is not available for almost all languages, with the exception of the CELEX database (Baayen et al., 1995) for English, German and Dutch, a paid resource distributed by the LDC.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 reports related work on semantic and morphological acquisition from MRDs.",
        "In Section 3, we describe how we converted Wiktionnaire, the French language edition of Wiktionary, into a structured XML-tagged MRD which contains, among other things, definitions and morphological relations.",
        "In Section 4, we explain how we used Wiktionnaire's morphological sections to create a lexicon of morphologically related words.",
        "The notion of morphological definitions and their automatic identification are introduced in Section 5.",
        "In Section 6, we show how these definitions enable us to acquire new derived words and enrich the initial lexicon.",
        "Finally, Section 7 describes an experiment where we semantically typed process nouns definitions.",
        "2 Related work Semantic relations are usually acquired using corpora (Curran and Moens, 2002; van der Plas and Bouma, 2005; Heylen et al., 2008) but may also be acquired from MRDs.",
        "MRDs-based approaches are bound to the availability of such resources.",
        "However, for some languages including French, no such resource exists.",
        "Recent years have seen the development of large resources built automatically by aggregating and/or translating data originating from different sources.",
        "For example, Sagot and Fi?ser (2008) have built WOLF, ?a free French Wordnet?",

        "The first impulse of this long-course reverse-engineering project is described in (Dendien, 1994) and resulted in the TLFi, a fine-grained XML-structured dictionary.",
        "Pierrel advocates mutualization, recommends resources sharing and underlines how the use of the TLFi would be relevant for NLP.",
        "Though we totally agree on this assertion, we deplore that the resource, being only available for manual use and not for download, prevents its use for NLP.",
        "Crowdsourcing has recently renewed the field of lexical resources development.",
        "For example Lafour-cade (2007) designed JeuxDeMots, a game with a purpose, to collect a great number of relations between words.",
        "Other works use the content of wikis produced by crowds of contributors.",
        "Initially in the shadow of Wikipedia, the use of Wiktionary tends to grow in NLP studies since its exploitation by Zesch et al. (2008).",
        "Its potential as an electronic lexicon was first studied by Navarro et al. (2009) for English and French.",
        "The authors leverage the dictionary to build a synonymy network and perform random walks to find missing links.",
        "Other works tackled data extraction: Anton P?erez et al. (2011) for instance, describe the integration of the Portuguese Wiktionary and Onto.PT; S?erasset (2012) built Dbnary, a multilingual network containing ?easily extractable?",
        "entries.",
        "If the assessment of Wiktionary's quality from a lexicographic point of view has not been done yet, Zesch and Gurevych (2010) have shown that lexical resources built by crowds lead to results comparable to those obtained with resources designed by pro-fessionals, when used to compute semantic relatedness of words.",
        "In Sajous et al. (2013a), we created an inflectional and phonological lexicon from Wiktionary and showed that its quality is comparable to those of reference lexicons, while the coverage is much wider.",
        "Comparatively little effort has been reported in literature on the exploitation of semantic relations to automatically identify morphological relations.",
        "Schone and Jurafsky (2000) learn morphology with a method based on semantic similarity extracted by latent semantic analysis.",

        "contextual information) in order to discover morphologically related words.",
        "Along the same line, Zweigenbaum and Grabar (2003) acquire semantic information from a medical corpus and use it to detect morphologically derived words.",
        "More recently, Hathout (2008) uses the TLFi to discover morphologically related words by combining orthographic and semantic similarity with formal analogy.",
        "I another work, Pentheroudakis and Vanderwende (1993) present a method to automatically extract morphological relations from the definitions of MRDs.",
        "The authors automatically identify classes of morphologically related words by comparing the semantic information in the entry of the derivative with the information stored in the candidate base form.",

        "boundaries and titles) is marked by XML tags.",
        "Remaining information is encoded in wikicode, an underspecified format used by the MediaWiki content-management system.",
        "As explained by Sajous et al. (2013b) and S?erasset (2012), this loose encoding format makes it difficult to extract consistent data.",
        "One can choose to either restrict the extraction to prototypical articles or design a fine-grained parser that collects the maximum of the available information.",

        "Martin (1983) uses these relations to characterize the definitions.",
        "In his typology, definitions as in (2) are considered to be (morphological) derivational because the definiendum is defined with respect to a morphologically related word.",
        "In these definitions, the lexical semantic relation only involves two words that are morphologically related.",
        "Being members of the same derivational family, the orthographic representations of these words show some degree of similarity that can help us identify the morphological definitions.",
        "In (2) for example, the written forms nitrificateur ?nitrifying?",
        "and nitrification ?nitrification?",
        "share a 10 letters prefix and only differ by 3 letters.",
        "This strong similarity is a reliable indicator of their morphologically relatedness (Hathout, 2011b).",

        "Proxinette is designed to reduce the search space for derivational analogies.",
        "The reduction is obtained by bringing closer the words that belong to the same derivational families and series, since it is precisely within these paradigms that an entry is likely to form analogies (Hathout, 2011a).",
        "Proxinette describes the lexemes by all the n-grams of characters that appear in their inflected forms in order to catch the inflectional stem allomorphy because it tends to also show up in derivation (Bonami et al., 2009).",
        "The n-grams have an additional tag that indicates if they occur at the beginning, at the end or in the middle of the word.",
        "This information is described by adding a # at the beginning and end of the written forms.",

        "Morphological similarity is estimated by simulating the spreading of an activation.",

        "This activation is then propagated towards the features of the entry.",
        "In a second step, the activations in the feature nodes are propagated towards the words that possess them.",
        "The words which obtain the highest activations are the most similar to the entry.",
