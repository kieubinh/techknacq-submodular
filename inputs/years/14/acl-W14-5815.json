        "The connections between WordNets, large semantic databases grouping lexical units into synonym sets or synsets, are an important resource in knowledge-based multilingual language processing.",
        "EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1997) aims to build language-specific WordNets among the same lines as the original WordNet 1 (Miller et al., 1990), using Inter-Lingual-Indexes to weave a web of equivalence relations between the synsets contained within the databases.",
        "Cornetto 2 (Vossen et al., 2007), a Dutch lexical-semantic collection of data associated with the Dutch EuroWordNet 3 , consists of more than 118 000 synsets.",
        "The equivalence relations establish connections between Dutch and English synsets in Princeton WordNet version 1.5 and 2.0.",
        "We update these links to Princeton WordNet version 3.0 by the mappings among WordNet versions made available by TALP-UPC 4 .",
        "The equivalence relations between Cornetto and Princeton have been established semi-automatically by Vossen et al. (1999).",
        "Manual coding was carried out for the 14 749 most important concepts in the database.",
        "These include the most frequent concepts, the concepts having a large amount of semantic relations and the concepts occupying a high position in the lexical hierarchy.",
        "Automatic linkage was done by mapping the bilingual Van Dale database 5 to WordNet 1.5.",
        "For every WordNet synset containing a dictionary's translation for a particular Dutch word, all its members were proposed as alternative translations.",
        "In the case of only one transla-tion, the synset relation was instantly assumed correct, while multiple translations were weighted using several heuristics, such as measuring the conceptual distance in the WordNet hierarchy.",
        "We decided to verify the quality of these links and noticed that they were highly erroneous, making them not yet very reliable for multilingual processing.",

        "A Cornetto synset is often linked to more than one Princeton synset.",
        "We found an erroneous link in 35.27% of the 998 equivalence relations we evaluated.",
        "Each Cornetto synset has about 3.3 automatically derived English equivalents, allowing to roughly compare our evaluation to an initial quality check of the equivalence relations performed by Vossen et al. (1999).",
        "They note that, in the case of synsets with three to nine translations, the percentages of correct automatically derived equivalents went down to 65% and 49% for nouns and verbs respectively.",
        "Our manual evaluations are in line with these results, showing that only 64.73% of all the connections in our sample are correct.",
        "An example of where it goes wrong is the Cornetto synset for the animal tor ?beetle?, which is not only appropriately linked to correct synsets (such as beetle and bug), but also mistakenly to the Princeton synset for the computational glitch.",
        "This flaw is most probably caused by the presence of the synonym bug, which is a commonly used word for errors in computer programs.",
        "Examples like these are omnipresent in our data 6 and led us to conclude that the synset links between Cornetto and Princeton WordNet definitely could be improved.",
        "We build a bilingual dictionary for Dutch and English and use these translations as an automatic indicator of the quality of equivalence relations.",
        "In order to create a huge list of translations we merge several translation word lists, removing double entries.",
        "Some are manually compiled dictionaries, while others are automatically derived word lists from parallel corpora: we extracted the 1-word phrases from the phrase tables built with Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) based on the GIZA++ word alignments (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "Table 1 gives an overview.",

        "We checked whether the automatic scoring algorithm (section 2) (dis)agreed with the manual judgements in order to determine a satisfactory threshold value for the acceptance of synset links.",
        "Evaluation results are shown in figure 2.",
        "While the precision (the proportion of accurate links that the system got right) went slightly up as our criterium for link acceptance became stricter, the recall (the proportion of correct links that the system retrieved) quickly made a rather deep dive.",
        "The F-score reveals that the best trade-off is reached when synset links getting a score of 0% are rejected, retaining any link with a higher confidence score.",
        "The results in Table 3 shows that we were able to reduce the error rate to 21.09%, which is a relative improvement of 40.20% over the baseline.",

        "We attribute this difference to the fact that Vossen et al. (1999) carried out manual coding for the most important concepts in the database (see section 1), as the Sclera and Beta pictographs tend to belong to this category.",
        "In these cases, every synset has between one and two automatically derived English equivalents on the average, allowing us to roughly compare with the initial quality check of the equivalence relations performed by Vossen et al. (1999) showing that, in the event of a Dutch synset having only one English equivalent, 86% of the nouns and 78% of the verbs were correctly linked, while the ones having two equivalents were appropriate in 68% and 71% of the cases respectively.",
        "The F-score in Figure 3 reveals that the best trade-off between precision and recall is reached at the > 0% threshold value, improving the baseline precision for both Sclera and Beta.",

        "The 200 most frequent Chinese words and the 10 most frequent adjectives were taken as a starting set and found as translation equivalences for 496 English lemmata, making each Chinese lemma corresponding to 2.13 English synsets on average.",
        "Evaluations showed that 77% of the 496 equivalent pairs were synonymous.",
        "This accuracy rate dropped to 62.7% when the list of equivalence pairs was extended by including all WordNet synonyms.",
        "Sornlertlamvanich et al. (2008) assign synsets to bilingual dictionaries for Asian languages by considering English equivalents and lexical synonyms, listing all English translations and scoring synsets according to the amount of matching translations found, yielding an average accuracy rate of 49.4% for synset assignment to a Thai-English dictionary and an accuracy rate of 93.3% for synsets that are attributed the highest confidence score.",
        "Joshi et al. (2012) generate candidate synsets in English, starting with synsets in Hindi.",
        "For each Hindi synset, a bag of words is obtained by parsing its gloss, examples and synonyms.",
        "Using a bilingual dictionary, these Hindi words are translated to English.",
        "Various heuristics are used to calculate the intersection between the translated bag of words and the synset words, concepts or relations of the target language, such as finding the closest hyperonym synset (accuracy rate of 79.76%), the closest common synset word bag (accuracy rate of 74.48%) and the closest common concept word bag (accuracy rate of 55.20%).",
        "Finally, Soria et al. (2009) develop a mechanism for enriching monolingual lexicons with new semantic relations by relying on the use of Inter-Lingual-Indexes to link WordNets of different languages.",
        "However, the quality of these links is not evaluated.",
        "5 Conclusions and future work We have shown that a rather large reduction in error rates (a relative improvement of 40.20% on the whole set) concerning the equivalence relations between Cornetto and Princeton WordNet can be acquired by applying a scoring algorithm based on bilingual dictionaries.",
        "The method can be used to create new equivalence relations as well.",
        "Contrasting our results with related work shows that we reach at least the same level of correctness, although results are hard to compare because of conceptual differences between languages.",
        "An accuracy rate of 78.91% was obtained for the general set of Cornetto's equivalence relations, while its subset of Sclera and Beta synsets (denoting frequent concepts) acquired final 124 precision rates of 90.05% and 86.53% respectively (compare with section 4).",
        "One advantage of our method is that it could easily be reused to automatically build reliable links between Princeton WordNet and brand-new WordNets.",
        "Unsupervised clustering methods can provide us with synonym sets in the source language, after which the bilingual dictionary technique and the scoring algorithm can be applied in order to provide us with satisfactory equivalence relations between both languages.",
        "Semantic relations between synsets can then also be transferred from Princeton to the source language's WordNet.",
        "Our improved links will be integrated in the next version of Cornetto.",
        "Future work will consist of scaling to other languages through other relations between WordNets.",
