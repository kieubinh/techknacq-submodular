        "Lexical resource development for computational analyses in Hindi must contend with a large number of light verb constructions.",
        "For instance, in the Hindi Treebank (Palmer et al., 2009), nearly 37% of the predicates have been annotated as light verb constructions.",
        "Hence, the combination of a noun with a light verb is a productive predicational strategy in Hindi.",
        "For example, the noun yaad ?memory?",
        "combines with kar ?do?",
        "to form yaad kar ?remember?.",
        "In light verb constructions, the noun is a predicating element along with the light verb.",
        "The presence of two predicating elements representing a single meaning is a challenge for a linguistic theory that maps between syntax and semantics.",
        "Consequently, the argument structure representation for light verb constructions (LVC) has resulted in two opposing views in syntactic theory.",
        "One view supports a noun-centric analysis of the LVC, where the noun is represented with all the arguments of the LVC e.g. (Grimshaw and Mester, 1988; Kearns, 1988).",
        "The light verb's only role is to theta-mark the arguments of the LVC, without any semantic contribution.",
        "The second view proposes argument sharing between the noun and the light verb as they both contribute to the argument structure of the LVC (Butt, 1995; Ahmed et al., 2012).",
        "We refer to such analyses as verb-centric analyses.",
        "Within the framework of this debate, we propose to use Lexicalized Feature-based Tree Adjoining Grammar, which is a variant of Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG).",
        "TAG has been used to represent light verb constructions in French (Abeill?e, 1988) and Korean (Han and Rambow, 2000).",
        "The primitive structures of TAG are its elementary trees, which encapsulate the syntactic and semantic arguments of its lexical anchor (for a light verb construction, the noun and light verb respectively will be the anchors).",
        "The association of a structural object with a linguistic anchor allows TAG to specify all the linguistic constraints associated with the anchor over a local domain.",
        "This is especially advantageous for composing the complex argument structure of a LVC.",
        "In comparison with other formalisms (e.g. context-free grammars), this property gives TAG an extended domain of locality.",
        "127 In this paper, we look at a particular group of nouns that occur with light verbs ?do?",
        "and ?be?",
        "(kar and ho) as part of a light verb construction.",
        "The same noun alternates with either light verb, resulting in a change in the argument structure of the verb.",
        "For example the noun chorii ?theft?",
        "can occur as either chorii kar ?theft do?",
        "or chorii ho ?theft happen?.",
        "There are nearly 265 nouns showing this alternation in the Hindi Treebank (Palmer et al., 2009) 1 .",
        "These constitute about 15% of the total light verb constructions in the Treebank.",
        "Note that other light verbs also occur in Hindi e.g. de ?give?, le ?take?",
        "etc.",
        "but they are not part of this study.",
        "Section 3 has some examples of these predicating nominals.",
        "Before this, Section 2 will introduce the TAG formalism.",
        "Section 4 describes the design of the elementary trees that are the basis of the analysis and in the final section we summarize our findings and make suggestions for future work.",
        "2 Lexicalized Feature based Tree Adjoining Grammar Tree-Adjoining Grammar (TAG) is a formal tree-rewriting system that is used to describe the syntax of natural languages (Joshi and Schabes, 1997).",
        "The basic structure of a TAG grammar is an elementary tree, which is a fragment of a phrase structure tree labelled with both terminal and non-terminal nodes.",
        "The elementary trees are combined by the operations of substitution (where a terminal node is replaced with a new tree) or adjunction (where an internal node is split to add a new tree).",
        "The elementary trees in TAG can be enriched with feature structures (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1988).",
        "These can capture linguistic descriptions in a more precise manner and also capture adjunction constraints.",
        "TAG with feature structures is also known as FTAG (Feature-structure based TAG).",
        "A TAG can also be lexicalized i.e., an elementary tree has a lexical item as one of its terminal nodes.",
        "Lexicalized TAG enhanced with feature structures is known as Lexicalized Feature-based Tree-Adjoining Grammar (LF-TAG).",
        "This has been used for developing computational grammars for English (XTAG-Group, 2001), French (Abeill?e and Candito, 2000) and Korean (Han et al., 2000).",
        "In our analysis, we will also use LF-TAG, but we will refer to it as LTAG for convenience.",
        "Figure 1 shows the basic steps for composing elementary trees containing feature structures.",
        "Each node has a top and a bottom feature structure.",
        "Features can be shared among nodes in an elementary tree.",
        "In the tree for the verb running, the variable 1 is used to show that the verb must share the same features as the subject NP.",
        "The tree for running is an initial tree with a single terminal for its argument noun phrase (NP).",
        "The tree for is, on the other hand, is a special type of elementary tree called the auxiliary tree.",
        "It has a foot node (marked with an asterisk), which is identical to its root node.",
        "The auxiliary tree will adjoin into the tree for running at the VP node only.",
        "The top and bottom feature structures for MODE at the VP node, have different values (ind and ger), and they cannot unify.",
        "This captures an adjunction constraint for obligatory adjunction and requires adjunction to take place at this node only.",
        "During adjunction, the top of the root of the auxiliary tree (for is) will unify with the top of the adjunction site.",
        "The bottom of the foot of the auxiliary tree will unify with the bottom of the adjunction site.",
        "During substitution, the top node in the tree for Jill unifies with the node at NP.",
        "This results in the second tree in Figure 1, post the operations of substitution and adjunction.",
        "In a final derivation step, top and bottom feature structures at each node will unify, to give the final derived tree with a single feature structure at each node.",
        "The resulting tree is called a derived tree, but another by-product of the TAG analysis is also the derivation tree.",
        "This tree has numbered node labels that record the history of composition of the elementary trees.",
        "For example, the tree for Jill is running can be seen in Figure 2.",
        "The root of this tree is labelled with running, which is an initial tree of the type S. An important characteristic of lexicalized elementary trees is their correspondence with that lexical item's predicate-argument structure.",
        "This has sometimes been formalized as the PACP (Predicate- Argument Co-occurrence Principle) (Frank, 2002).",
        "The PACP restricts the structure of the elementary trees such that they may not be drawn arbitrarily.",
        "At the same time, lexicalized TAGs will often have the 1 It is possible that many more nouns occur in this group, but all their alternations are not instantiated in the Treebank corpus.",

        "and ?sodan ?become?",
        "are used in a manner similar (although not identical) to Hindi.",
        "The noun chorii ?theft?",
        "belongs to a particular class of nouns where a change in the light verb does result in a change in the arguments, but the agent argument is always presupposed, irrespective of the light verb.",
        "For instance, the addition of a phrase such as apne-aap ?on its own?",
        "is semantically odd with example 1.",
        "This is because the event of ?theft?",
        "cannot occur without an agent, although it is unexpressed with the light verb ho ?be?.",
        "Contrast this with 4, where apne-aap is not odd and where the alternation with kar ?do?",
        "is not possible.",
        "The non-alternating noun afsos ?regret?",

        "In order to model such nominals in TAG we have three options: first, a noun-centric analysis, where the nominal projects all the arguments of the LVC.",
        "In reference to the examples above, this would imply that the light verb chorii ?theft?",
        "would be represented by two trees?",
        "i.e., it would appear with two arguments with kar ?do?",
        "and only one with ho ?be?.",

        "as the anchor of a single elementary tree?",
        "a single multi-word expression.",
        "While the first two options are worth exploring, we discard the third option for two reasons: first, the LVC is highly productive in Hindi, which would imply that this would result in too many elementary trees in the grammar.",
        "Second, there is evidence that the LVC forms a phrasal category in the syntax (Mohanan, 1997; Davison, 2005).",
        "This means that individual components of the LVC may be moved away from each other, emphatic particles or negation may intervene and the noun component may be independently modified by an adjective.",
        "Therefore, the multi-word option would not be the best approach here.",
        "This is in contrast to previous TAG analyses for English LVCs where both nominal and verb are anchored in the same elementary tree (XTAG-Group, 2001).",
        "Figure 3 shows the derivation trees (cf.",

        "The dashed line indicates adjunction into the elementary tree, whereas the solid line indicates substitution.",
        "In the noun-centric analysis, the light verb adjoins into the nominal's elementary tree and contributes no arguments of its own.",

        "or kar ?do?.",
        "Making the elementary structures richer and more complex increases ambiguity locally and we then have more descriptions for the same lexical item.",
        "But these structures also capture local dependencies i.e., the fact that the lexical item can appear in varying linguistic environments.",
        "Second, this is in keeping with the TAG notion of using complex elementary structures to capture linguistic properties and having very general operations (substitution and adjunction) to combine these structures.",
        "This has been used effectively in computational applications and is characterised by the slogan complicate locally, simplify globally (Bangalore and Joshi, 2010).",

        "This work has also proposed separate trees for the nominal and light verb.",

        "The light verb on the other hand is represented as an auxiliary tree, therefore it is an adjunct to the nominal's basic structure.",
        "However, as it is a predicate, it is also a special type of auxiliary tree viz., a predicative auxiliary tree (Abeill?e and Rambow, 2000).",
        "The second feature of this analysis, also based on Han and Rambow (2000)'s work is the idea of the nominal as an underspecified base form.",
        "The nominal's elementary tree is not specified with respect to its category, rather, we use the label X, which projects to an XP.",
        "We also assume, following Han and Rambow that each node is specified with the feature CAT which has values like V or N, but the [CAT=N] feature on the noun is not realized unless the light verb composes with the elementary tree of the nominal.",

        "They do not consider the nominal's alternation with the light verb ho ?be?",
        "as a light verb construction.",
        "Instead, they maintain that it has a resultative reading and provide a different analysis within the Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) framework.",
        "In fact, the alternation with ho ?be?",
        "provides a useful lexical alternative to an alternative syntactic structure (such as a passive).",
        "The alternation of the light verb ho ?be?",

        "is indeed a light verb construction.",
        "Ahmed and Butt (2011)'s analysis looks at the noun and light verb as co-predicators i.e., it is a verb centric analysis.",
        "While this is different from the proposed analysis here, it is not impossible to construct elementary trees where the light verb's elementary tree consists of one argument i.e., the subject and the nominal (with its own argument) adjoins into it.",
        "The pros and cons of these two approaches need to be explored more thoroughly within the TAG framework and we leave this to future work.",
        "While this work has examined one class of nominals that occur as part of light verb constructions, it does not complete the analysis of light verb constructions in Hindi.",
        "The behaviour of other nominal classes remains to be explored.",
        "There are also nominals that occur with light verbs other than kar ?do?",

        "Finally, while the work presented here is mainly theoretical, it is in keeping with recent proposals for extracting a Hindi TAG grammar from a phrase structure treebank (Bhatt et al., 2012; Mannem et al., 2009).",
        "The algorithm in Bhatt et al. (2012) relies on the annotated Hindi Dependency Treebank and proposes a rule extraction system for elementary trees.",
        "Therefore, the description of Hindi LVCs in TAG would be a useful addition to the implementation of a grammar extraction task.",
