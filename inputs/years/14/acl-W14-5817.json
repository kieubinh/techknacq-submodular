        "Idioms, and multi-word expressions in general, have always been \"a pain in the neck\", as Sag et al. (2001) state in the title of their paper.",
        "The formal representation and the construction of a computational linguistic model of idioms is not an easy task as shown by Gazdar et al. (1985), Pulman (1993), Abeill? (1995), Villavicencio et al. (2004), Muzny and Zettlemoyer (2013) to name a few of the many (computational) linguists who have carried out research on this topic.",
        "It has always been pointed out that the main problem concerning the automatic analysis of idioms is the difficulty to disambiguate such constructions which are ambiguous by definition (Fothergill and Baldwin 2012, Li and Sporlender 2009, Fazly et al. 2009, McShane and Nirenburg 2014).",
        "However, given the flexibility of idioms, a more basic and still unsolved problem has to be taken into account: that is, the extraction and annotation of such constructions (Fellbaum 2011).",
        "As Fazly et al. (2009, p. 61) point out \"despite a great deal of research on the properties of idioms in the linguistics literature, there is not much agreement on which properties are characteristics of these expressions\".",
        "The distinction drawn by Nunberg et al. (1994) between idiomatic phrases and idiomatically combining expressions has been adopted by most of the research on idioms.",
        "However, many problems still remain and they are due to two basic reasons.",
        "On one hand, idioms can be considered lexical units, given the fact that their \"special meaning\" is associated to a particular verb and one or more particular complements.",
        "On the other hand, idioms syntactically behave as non-idiomatic constructions.",
        "Passive is the syntactic construction more frequently analyzed by the linguistic research on idioms since it involves the occurrence of the fixed object to the left of the verb.",
        "However, idioms show a great deal of other syntactic constructions where the fixed object may not necessarily occur in postverbal position (see Vietri 2014, forthcoming).",
        "It is for these peculiarities that idioms have also aroused the interest of the psycholinguistic researchers who have advanced several hypothesis on the processing of idioms (Swinney and Cutler, ",
        ".",
        "137 1979; Gibbs, 1995; Cacciari and Tabossi, 1988; Cutting and Bock, 1997; Sprenger et al., 2006).",
        "The systematic description of French idiomatic and non-idiomatic constructions has been carried out by Gross (1982, 1988) and his colleagues (Lecl?re, 2002) on the basis of the formal principles of the Lexicon-Grammar methodology, as developed by Gross (1975, 1979).",
        "According to Gross, the basic syntactic unit is not the word but the simple or elementary sentence, and the Lexicon-Grammar of a language is organized into three main components: free sentences, frozen sentences (or idioms), support verbs sentences (Gross 1981, 1998).",
        "For each component, Gross and his colleagues built exhaustive classifications, systematically organized and represented by binary matrixes (named Lexicon-Grammar tables), where each syntactic and/or distributional property is marked \"+\" or \"-\" if accepted or not by a certain lexical unit.",
        "In the Lexicon-Grammar methodology, idiomatic and non-idiomatic constructions are built according to the same formal principles.",
        "The difference between these two types of constructions mainly concerns the distribution: idioms show a higher level of restricted distribution than non-idioms.",
        "The French Lexicon-Grammars are available at http://infolingu.univ-mlv.fr/english/.",
        "A classification of English idioms and phrasal verbs has been carried out according to the same formal principles and criteria, respectively, by Freckleton (1985) and Machonis (1985).",
        "A Lexicon-Grammar of European Portuguese idioms has been built by Baptista (2005a, 2005b).",
        "The Lexicon-Grammar classification of Italian idioms has been implemented on the basis of Gross' methodology.",
        "It includes more than 30 Lexicon-Grammar classes of idioms with ordinary verbs (sec.",
        "2) and support verbs (sec.",
        "3), for a total of more than 7,000 lexical entries1.",
        "The binary matrixes are created in Excel format.",
        "2 The Lexicon-Grammar of Italian Idioms with Ordinary Verbs The Lexicon-Grammar of idioms using ordinary verbs includes 12 classes for a total of 3,990 entries (sec.",
        "2.1, Table 1).",
        "Each class of idioms contains those constructions which share the same definitional structure.",
        "In the Lexicon-Grammar framework, the definitional structure is identified on the basis of the arguments required by the operators (see Harris 1982).",
        "In the case of idioms, the operator consists of the Verb and the Fixed element(s), while the argument may be the subject and/or a free complement.",
        "This section shows only the main differences between the idioms' classes C1 and CAN.",
        "For example, idioms in (1) and (2) have two different definitional structures.",
        "On one hand, an idiom such as tagliare la corda in (1) is an operator that requires only one argument, i.e. the subject.",
        "On the other hand, an idiom such as rompere le balle in (2) is an operator that requires two arguments, the subject and the noun Amy within the prepositional complement.",
        "The prepositions a and di alternate and can be considered fixed: 1.",
        "Amy ha tagliato la corda \"to sneak off\" Amy-has-cut-the-rope 2.",
        "Joe ha rotto le balle (a + di) Amy \"to annoy sb.\"",
        "Joe-has-broken-the-balls-(to + of)-Amy Idioms such as (1) have been listed and analyzed in a class named C1, that counts about 1,200 entries.",
        "Furthermore, C indicates the \"constrained\" or \"fixed\" noun and 1 refers to its position in the sentence, in this case, the object position.",
        "These idioms have only one argument, that is the (non-fixed noun) in subject position.",
        "The definitional structure of the class C1 is N0 V C1 where N indicates the free noun, V the verb and C, as previously stated, the fixed element.",
        "The subscripts 0 and 1 indicate the position of the noun within the sentence in a linear order, in this case, the subject and the object position.",
        "Idioms such as (2) have been listed and analyzed in the class named CAN, that counts 320 entries.",
        "The definitional structure of this class is N0 V C1 (a + di) N2, since these idioms have two arguments, 1 Vietri (1984) includes the very first classification of Italian idioms.",
        "Since then, the classification has been widely en-riched, updated and completely re-examined.",
        "For a semantic study of Italian idioms, see Casadei (1996).",
        "A Lexicon-Grammar classification of Verb-particle constructions has been developed by Guglielmo (2013).",
        "From a different per-spective, Masini (2005) provides a synchronic and diacronic analysis of Italian verb-particle constructions found in a corpus.",
        "138 i.e. the subject N0 and the noun N2.",
        "The alternation of the prepositions a and di is represented between brackets, and the \"+\" sign indicates \"either/or\".",
        "Each class, formally represented by a table in the form of a binary matrix, contains a specific number of idiomatic entries associated with a specific number of distributional and syntactic properties.",
        "In particular, each row of the matrix corresponds to an idiom, and each column to a property (or a con-struction).",
        "If the idiom accepts that particular property, a \"+\" sign is placed at the intersection between the row and the column; otherwise a \"-\" sign occurs.",
        "As a sample of this type of lexical resource, I will give an excerpt of the class C1 in Figure 1.",
        "The central non-numbered columns indicate the \"part of speech\" assigned to each lexical element that constitutes the idiomatic construction.",
        "In an idiom like non alzare un dito (lit.",
        "not lift a finger), the negation non is obligatory.",
        "On the other hand, the si-pronominal form is obligatory in idioms like leccarsi i baffi (lit.",
        "lick-si the moustaches).",
        "The determiner can be Definite (Def), Indefinite (Ind), or null (Zero).",
        "As previously pointed out, V refers to the verb and C to the fixed noun.",
        "The properties from [1] to [3] indicate the distribution of N0, i.e. the subject.",
        "It can be expressed by [?",
        "human] noun or a by a sentence [Ch F].",
        "The distributional property [4] indicates if C1 is expressed by a body-part noun, whereas the morphological property [5] indicates if C1 can be in the plural form.",
        "Property [4] showed that 1,700+ idioms involve a body-part noun, at least the 24% of the overall classification.",
        "Property [5] is a useful piece of information because it refers to the possible variation of the fixed noun and, consequently, of the determiner.",
