        "We firstly selected about 1,200 Chinese nominal compounds from a lexicon of modern Chinese and the Sinica Corpus.",
        "Then through a series of crowdsourcing experiments conducted on the Crowdflower platform, we successfully collected both overall semantic transparency and constituent semantic transparency data for each of them.",
        "According to our evaluation, the data quality is good.",
        "This work filled a gap in Chinese language resources and also practiced and explored the crowdsourcing methodology for linguistic experiment and language resource construction."

        "This phenomenon is called semantic transparency of compounds.",
        "We distinguish between overall semantic transparency (OST) and constituent semantic transparency (CST).",
        "The semantic transparency of a compound, i.e., the overall semantic transparency, is the extent to which the compound retains its literal meaning in its actual meaning.",
        "The semantic transparency of a constituent of a compound, i.e., the constituent semantic transparency, is the extent to which the constituent retains its meaning in the actual meaning of the compound.",
        "Semantic similarity between the literal meaning and the actual meaning of a compound can be used to estimate the overall semantic transparency of a compound, for the more the literal meaning is retained in the actual meaning, the more similar they are.",
        "The same technique can be used to estimate constituent semantic transparency.",
        "Semantic transparency can be quantified; if we assign 0 to ?fully opaque?",
        "and assign 1 to ?fully transparent?, then semantic transparency can be quantified as a closed interval [0, 1].",
        "The quantitative analysis of semantic transparency must be supported by semantic transparency datasets.",
        "In previous semantic transparency related studies on Chinese compounds, some researchers created some datasets to support their own studies.",
        "But this kind of datasets are usually relatively small and restrictive, so cannot be used widely, for example, (???",
        "and?",
        "?, 2001; Myers et al., 2004;?",
        "?",
        "?, 2008; Mok, 2009), etc.",
        "Some datasets, although large enough and can be used in other studies, are not publicly accessible, for example, (???",
        "and??",
        "?, 1999;??",
        "and??",
        "?, 2005), etc.",
        "A large and publicly accessible semantic transparency dataset of Chinese compounds is still a gap in Chinese language resources.",
        "Crowdsourcing, as an emergingmethod of data collection and resource construction (Snow et al., 2008; Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010; Munro et al., 2010; Schnoebelen and Kuperman, 2010; Gurevych and Zesch, 2013; Wang et al., 2013) and an emerging method of behavioral experiment (Paolacci et al., 2010; This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "147 Berinsky et al., 2011; Mason and Suri, 2012; Rand, 2012; Crump et al., 2013), is attracting more andmore attention from the field of language study and language computing.",
        "As a method of data collection and resource construction, it has the advantages of high speed and low cost, etc.",
        "It can use redundancy to filter out noise in order to improve data quality; if used properly, it can produce expert-level data.",
        "As a method of experiment, besides the above advantages, it also has the following ones, (1) it is easier to obtain large samples, because the amount of potential participants is huge; (2) the diversity of participants is good, because the participants are from different places and have different backgrounds; (3) crowdsourcing environments are usually anonymous, so it is easier to collect certain sensitive data.",
        "2 Method 2.1 Compound Selection We use the following criteria to select compounds, (1) they are disyllabic nominal compounds; (2) each of them has the structure NN, AN, or VN; (3) they are composed of free morphemes; (4) they have mid-range word frequencies; and (5) they are used in both Mainland China and Taiwan.",
        "And we select compounds according to the following procedure: (1) Extract monosyllabic nouns, adjectives and verbs mainly according to ?The Dictionary of Contemporary Chinese (the 6th edition)?",
        "(??????,?",
        "6?",
        "), and thus we get three sets, a) the set of monosyllabic nouns, N; b) the set of monosyllabic adjectives, A; and c) the set of monosyllabic verbs, V. (2) Extract the words of the structure NN, AN, or VN 1 from the ?Lexicon of Common Words in Contemporary Chinese?",
        "(????????).",
        "In this step, NN means both morphemes of the word appear in the set N; AN means the first morpheme appears in the set A and the second appears in the set N; VN means the first morpheme appears in the set V and the second appears in the set N. After this step, we get ?word list 1?.",
        "(3) Extract the words which have mid-range frequencies 2 from the Sinica Corpus 4.0 (Chen et al., 1996).",
        "These words are represented in traditional Chinese characters.",
        "We convert them into simplified Chinese characters and only reserve the words which also appear in ?word list 1?.",
        "After this step, we get ?word list 2?.",
        "(4) Manually verify ?word list 2?",
        "to generate the final list.",
        "Things need to be verified include the following aspects.",
        "(a) Because in ?word list 2?",
        "word structures are judged automatically, there are many errors, so we have to verify the correctness of the word structure judgments.",
        "(b) We have to make sure that the morphemes of each word are free morphemes.",
        "(c) We also need to delete some proper nouns.",
        "The words we selected appear in both Sinica Corpus 4.0 and ?Lexicon of Common Words in Contemporary Chinese?.",
        "Since there is no completely reliable criterion to identify Chinese word, appearing in two lexicons ensures their word identity.",
        "This also ensures that they are used in both Mainland China and Taiwan, and further means they are quite possible to be shared in other Chinese language communities, for example Hong Kong, Macau, and Singapore, etc.",
        "According to above criteria and procedure, we selected a total of 1,176 words.",
        "664 (56.46%) of them have the structure NN; 322 (27.38%) have the structure AN; and 190 (16.16%) have the structure VN.",
        "2.2 Experimental Design Normally, a crowdsourcing experiment should be reasonably small in size.",
        "We randomly divide these 1,176 words into 21 groups, G i (i = 1, 2, 3, ..., 21); each group has 56 words.",
        "1See???",
        "and???",
        "(1998), and Huang (1998) for relevant statistics.",
        "2We use cumulative frequency feature to determine mid-range frequency.",
        "Sort the word frequency list of Sinica Corpus 4.0 descendingly; then calculate cumulative frequency word by word until each word corresponds with a cumulative frequency value; finally, plot a curve on a coordinate plane whose x-axis represents the ranks of words in the sorted list, and the y-axis represents cumulative frequency values.",
        "Very apparently, this curve can be divided into three successive phases; the words within each phase have similar word frequency features.",
        "According to this, we identify three word frequency categories, 5,163 high-frequency words (frequency range: [182, 581823], cumulative frequency range: [0%, 80%]), 19,803 mid-range frequency words (frequency range: [23, 181], cumulative frequency range: (80%, 93%]), and 177,496 low-frequency words (frequency range: [1, 22], cumulative frequency range: (93%, 100%]).",
        "Sinica Corpus 4.0 contains about 11.2 million word tokens.",
        "148 Questionnaires We collect overall semantic transparency (OST) and constituent semantic transparency (CST) data of these words.",
        "In order to avoid interaction, we designed two kinds of questionnaires to collect OST data and CST data respectively.",
        "SoG i (i = 1, 2, 3, ..., 21) has two questionnaires, one OST questionnaire for OST data collection and one CST questionnaire for CST data collection.",
        "Besides titles and instructions, each questionnaire has 3 sections.",
        "Section 1 is used to collect identity information includes gender, age, education and location.",
        "Section 2 contains four very simple questions about the Chinese language; the first two questions are open-ended Chinese character identification questions, the third question is a close-ended homophonic character identification question, and the fourth one is a close-ended antonymous character identification question; different questionnaires use different questions.",
        "Section 3 contains the questions for semantic transparency data collection.",
        "Suppose AB is a disyllabic nominal compound, we use the following question to collect its OST rating scores: ?How is the sum of the meanings of A and B similar to the meaning of AB??",
        "And use the following two questions to collect its CST rating scores of its two constituents: ?How is the meaning of A when it is used alone similar to its meaning in AB??",
        "and ?How is the meaning of B when it is used alone similar to its meaning in AB??.",
        "7-point scales are used in section 3; 1 means ?not similar at all?",
        "and 7 means ?almost the same?.",
        "In order to evaluate the data received in the experiments, we embedded some evaluation devices in the questionnaires.",
        "We mainly evaluated intra-group and inter-group consistency; and if the data have good intra-group and inter-group consistency, we can believe that the data quality is good.",
        "In each group we choose two words and make them appear twice, we call them intra-group repeated words and we can use them to evaluate the intra-group consistency.",
        "We insert into each group two same extra words, w 1 ??",
        "?",
        "?, w 2 ???",
        "?, to evaluate the inter-group consistency.",
        "Quality Control Measures On a crowdsourcing platform like Crowdflower, the participants are anonymous, they may try to cheat and submit invalid data, and they may come from different countries and speak different languages rather than the required one.",
        "There may be spammers who continuously submit invalid data at very high speed and they may even bypass the quality control measures to cheat for money.",
        "In order to ensure that the participants are native Chinese speakers and to improve data quality, we use the following measures, (1) a participant must correctly answer the first two Chinese character identification questions in the section 2s of the questionnaires, and he/she must correctly answer at least one of the last two questions in these section 2s; (2) If a participant do not satisfy the above conditions, he/she will not see Section 3s; (3) each word stimulus in section 3s has an option which allows the participants to skip it in case he/she does not recognize that word; (4) all the questions in the questionnaires must be answered except the ones which allow to be skipped and are explicitly claimed to be skipped; (5) we wrote a monitor program to detect and resist spammers automatically; (6) after the experiment is finished, we will analyze the data and filter out invalid data, and we will discuss this in detail in section 3.",
        "2.3 Experimental Platform and Procedure We choose Crowdflower as our experimental platform, because according to our previous experiments, it is a feasible crowdsourcing platform to collect Chinese language data.",
        "We create one task for each questionnaire on the platform; there are 21 groups of word and each group has one OST questionnaire and one CST questionnaire, so there are a total of 42 tasksT ost i , T cst i (i = 1, 2, 3, ..., 21).",
        "We publish these 42 tasks successively, and for each task we create a monitor program to detect and resist spammers.",
        "All of these tasks use the following parameters: (1) each task will collect 90 responses; (2) we pay 0.15USD for each response of OST questionnaire and pay 0.25USD for each response of CST questionnaire; (3) each worker account of Crowdflower can only submit one response for each questionnaire and each IP address can only submit one response for each questionnaire; (4) we only allow the workers from the following regions (according to IP addresses) to submit data: Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, USA, UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, France, Italy, New Zealand, and Indonesia; and we can dynamically disable or enable certain regions on demand in order to ensure both data quality and quantity.",

        "The CST dataset produced by the CST task T cst i is Dcst i .",

        "Intra-group Consistency of CST Results Each intra-group repeated word has two constituents, c 1 , c 2 , so each constituent gets two CST results, i.e., r c1,1 , r c1,2 and r c2,1 , r c2,2 .",

        "Standard deviation can be used to measure difference, for example, the standard deviation of the 21 OST results of w 1 is 0.2; this value is small and indicates high consistency; because these 21 results are from the OST datasets of 21 groups respectively, so we can say that these 21 OST datasets have good intergroup consistency.",
        "The standard deviation of the 21 OST results of w 2 is 0.14; the standard deviation of 21 CST results of the first constituent of w 1 is 0.2, and that of the second is 0.18; the standard deviation of 21 CST results of the first constituent of w 2 is 0.15, and that of the second is 0.2; all of these values are small and all of them indicate good inter-group consistency (see Table 4).",
        "4.3 Correlation between OST and CST Results Each compound in the datasets has two constituents; both constituents affect the OST of the compound, but neither of them can solely determine the OST of the compound.",
        "So the mean of the two CST values of a compound is a fairly good estimation of its OST value.",
