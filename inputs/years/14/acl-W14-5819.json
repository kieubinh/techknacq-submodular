        "Event classification is a fundamental task for NLP applications, such as question answering and machine translation, which need deep understanding of the text.",
        "Previous work (Siegel, 1999; Siegel and McKeown, 2000; Palmer et al., 2007; Zarcone and Lenci, 2008; Cao et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2000) aims to classify events into four categories, namely state, activity, accomplishment and achievement, i.e. Vendler's framework adopted from linguistic studies (Vendler, 1967; Smith, 1991).",
        "High performance was reported on the classification, however based on the assumption that all sentences describe an even-t, which is not case in real text.",
        "Modalities and speech acts are not considered and no finer-grained classification is proposed.",
        "The aim for aspectual classification for a specific language is to build verb classes.",
        "In such framework, viewpoint aspect in terms of perfective vs. imperfective is not considered.",
        "For example, he is eating a sandwich and he ate a sandwich are all instances of accomplishment.",
        "However, we argue that this framework is not enough for more accurate event processing.",
        "It is obvious that the two sentences have different meanings and different consequences.",
        "The situation described by the first sentence is still going on at the speech time, while the second sentence implies that the event has finished.",
        "So, in the perspective of event processing, it is necessary and important to discriminate the two different aspects.",
        "Another important issue is that not all sentences describe events.",
        "For example, Austin (1975) discriminated two different types of sentences: constative and performative.",
        "Sentences that report or describe events are in the first category.",
        "Sentences of the performative category mainly refer to speech (illocu- tionary) acts, actions that are done by speech.",
        "For example, by uttering the sentence I declare that the new policy will take effect from now on, the authorized speaker brings a new policy into effect.",
        "In this case, uttering the sentence itself is an event.",
        "Discriminating speech acts are especially useful in speech corpora, e.g. (Avila and Mello, 2013).",
        "Modality is important due to its interaction with factuality and truth of the embedded propositions.",
        "For example, he can eat two sandwiches describes a dynamic modality about the subject's ability of eating.",
        "157 However, no eating event has actually happened.",
        "Modality has been considered in modeling speaker's opinions (Benamara et al., 2012), machine translation (Baker et al., 2012), etc.",
        "Sauri et al. (2006; 2012) proposed a framework for modeling modalities.",
        "However, their definition of modality is a little different from that used by linguists.",
        "The main motivation of their work is to predict the factuality of a proposition.",
        "As a result, all factors that may affect the factuality of propositions are regarded as modalities.",
        "In our framework, we will adopt the definition in linguistic studies that modality expresses a speaker's belief or attitude on an embedded proposition (Palmer, 2001).",
        "Factuality is determined by many factors other than modalities.",
        "However, we don't want to mix all the factors together in linguistic perspective.",
        "In this paper, we will describe a Chinese corpus in which different sentence types are discriminated.",
        "Finer-grained event types are also incorporated with a theory proposed in (Xu and Huang, 2013).",
        "The details of the framework will be discussed in the next section.",
        "The remaining of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 introduces the theoretical framework we shall adopt for our annotation.",
        "Section 3 describes a Chinese corpus we annotated with some statistical information.",
        "Section 4 describes a classification experiment based on the annotated corpus.",
        "Section 5 is the conclusion and our future work.",
        "2 The Annotation Framework In this section, we will give an introduction to the theoretical framework from a linguistic perspective.",
        "There are two main levels for the classification.",
        "Sentences are first discriminated according to their main functions, e.g. constative and performative (Austin, 1975).",
        "Constative sentences are further divided into modality which mainly expresses the addresser's propositional attitude and event which is a description or report of a real situation without the speaker's attitude.",
        "One basic assumption is that one sentence only has one main function in terms of expressing speaker's modality, speech act or describing an event.",
        "So, there is no overlap among the three types of sentences.",
        "2.1 Modality Sentences denoting modalities are different from the sentences reporting events in that the former only refers to a proposition upon which the speaker expresses his attitude its truth value, while the later is a fact without incorporating speakers?",
        "opinions but only speaker's perception.",
        "It is possible that speakers can make mistakes in their perceptions.",
        "However it is beyond the linguistic level and there is no way to predict the correctness based on the surface of the sentence.",
        "Thus, it is another issue out of the discussion of this paper.",
        "We adopt the modal theory by Palmer (2001).",
        "According to him, modality could be divided into epistemic, deontic and dynamic.",
        "Epistemic modality expressed the speaker's opinion on the truth of the embedded proposition in terms of necessity and possibility.",
        "Informally, epistemic modality expresses what may be in the world.",
        "For example, ta1 ken3ding4 zai4 ban4gong1shi4 ?he must be in his office?",
        "describes an epistemic modality of the speaker that he is sure about the truth of the embedded proposition.",
        "Deontic modality expresses what should be in the world, according to speaker's expectations, certain rules, laws and so on.",
        "For example, ni3 bi4xu1 zun1shou3 gui1ze2 ?You must obey the rules?.",
        "Dynamic modality describes the abilities of a subject, such as ta1 hui4 you2you3 ?he can swim?, wo3 de0 ban4gong1shi4 ke3yi3 kan4jian4 da4hai3 ?you can see the ocean from my office?.",
        "Evaluation is also treated as a modality in our framework.",
        "Evaluation describes the speaker's opinion on a proposition.",
        "It is different from epistemic in that it suggests rather than makes judgment on the truth of a proposition.",
        "For example, ta1 suan4shi4 shi4jie4shang4 zui4hao3 de0 ge1shou3 le0 ?he should be the best singer in the world?.",
        "Evaluative sentences only refer to those that contain explicit markers, e.g. suan4shi4 ?should be?.",
        "The sentence ta1 shi4 shi4jie4shang4 zui4hao3 de0 ge1shou3 ?he is the best singer in the world?",
        "is not treated as evaluation.",
        "In this sense, evaluative is not equivalent to subjective.",
        "158 Exclamation is treated as a subset of evaluation.",
        "Take nian2qing1 ren2 a0 !",
        "?Young people!?",
        "for example, it mostly expresses an implicit evaluation, e.g. only young people could do crazy things of some kind, based on which the exclamation is expressed by the speaker.",
        "2.2 Speech act For speech act (illocutionary act), we adopt the theory by Searle (1976), where five different categories are proposed, namely assertive, expressive, directive, commissive and declaration.",
        "In addition, we also put interrogative sentences under this category.",
        "Speech act sentences only refer to those sentences that are explicit utterances, e.g. the sentences quoted in text.",
        "Assertive is to commit the speaker (in varying degrees) to something's being the case or the truth of the expressed proposition.",
        "For example, wo3 zheng4ming2 ta1 shi4 xue2sheng1 ?I certify that he is a student?.",
        "Expressive expresses the psychological state specified in the sincerity condition about a state of affairs specified in the propositional content.",
        "Verbs for expressive speech act includes xie4xie4 ?thank?, bao4qian4 ?apologize?, huan1ying2 ?welcome?, dui4bu4qi3 ?sorry?",
        "etc.",
        "For example, xie4xie4 bang1mang2 ?Thanks for your help?.",
        "Directive is usually a command or requirement of the speaker to get the hearer to do something.",
        "For example, ni3 guo4lai2 yi1xia4 ?Come here please?.",
        "Commissive is to commit the speaker (in varying degrees) to some future course of action.",
        "For exam-ple, wo3 hui4 bang1 ni3 ?I shall help you?.",
        "Declaration is to bring about the correspondence between the propositional content and reality.",
        "Successful performance guarantees that the propositional content corresponds to the world.",
        "For example, wo3 xuan1bu4 ben3 ci4 hui4yi4 zheng4shi4 kai1mu4 ?The conference now start?.",
        "Interrogative is an illocutionary act of the speaker that requires the hearer to provided some information.",
        "For example, ni3 jiao4 shen2me0 ming2zi4 ?",
        "?What's your name??",
        "and ni3 qu4 ting1 na4 ge4 jiang3zuo4 ma0 ?",
        "?Will you attend the speech??",
        "Interrogative sentences are usually with a question mark ???.",
        "However, not all sentences with question mark are interrogative.",
        "For example, rhetorical questions usually don't need the answer from the hearer.",
        "Instead, it actually expresses the speaker's evaluation on a situation.",
        "For example, the sentence wo3 zen3me0 ke3yi3 bu4 jin4xin1 zhao4gu4 ?",
        "?How could I not take care of him carefully??",
        "should be labelled as evaluative modality rather than interrogative speech act.",
        "2.3 Events Here, we describe a new framework by incorporating finer-grained event categories as described in (X- u and Huang, 2013).",
        "Each of the finer-grained categories corresponds to only one of the five coarse categories.",
        "So, it is an extension of and is compatible with the Vendler's framework.",
        "2.3.1 Primitive Events According to Xu and Huang (2013), there are three event primitives, namely static state (S), dynamic state (D), and change of state.",
        "Static state is equivalent to the previous notion state, which is a homogeneous process, where all subparts are of the same kind of event.",
        "Dynamic state refers to an ongoing dynamic process, e.g. running, eating etc., that is perceived like a state.",
        "Change of state is then defined as a change from one state, either static or dynamic, to another state.",
        "Change of state actually refers to the previous notion achievement.",
        "Theoretically, there are four types of changes: static-static change (SS), static-dynamic change (SD), dynamic-static change (DS) and dynamic-dynamic change (DD).",
        "In detail, SD change is somewhat equivalent to inceptive achievement, and DS change is somewhat equivalent to terminative or completive achievement.",
        "159 Event Type Representation Example Static State ?- ta1 hen3 gao1 he is tall Dynamic State ????",
        "ta1 zai4 pao3bu4 he is running SS Change ?|?",
        "ta1 bing4 le0 he got ill SD Change ?|???",
        "ta1 kai1shi3 pao3bu4 le0 he started running DS Change ???|?",
        "ta1 ting2zhi3 pao3bu4 le0 he stopped running DD Change ???|???",
        "dian4nao3 qi3dong4 hao3 le0 the computer finished startup Table 1: Primitives of Events.",
        "Table 1 shows the extended event primitives with some illustrative examples.",
        "We use ???",
        "and ?????",
        "to denote static state and dynamic state respectively.",
        "?|?",
        "is used to denote a temporal boundary.",
        "In case of change of state, the temporal boundary overlap with the logical boundary, i.e. the change.",
        "Negations usually denote static state.",
        "In Chinese, there are two negation adverbs, bu4 ?not?",
        "and mei2you3 ?not?.",
        "However, they are different in that the former negates a generic event meaning that such event doesn't happen, while the latter negates the existence of an event instance.",
        "For example, ta1 bu4 he1jiu3 ?he doesn't drink?",
        "describes an attribute of the subject, which is intrinsically a static state.",
        "ta1 mei2you3 he1jiu3 ?he didn't drink?",
        "describes a fact that there is no event instance of his drinking, which is also a static state.",
        "Negation of a modality is still a modality.",
        "For example, ta1 bu4 ke3neng2 zai4 ban4gong1shi4 ?he cannot be in his office?",
        "still describes an epistemic modality.",
        "2.3.2 Complex Events Based on the primitives, we can compose complex events.",
        "Delimitative describes a temporal bounded static state that has a potential starting point and ending point, within which the static state holds, e.g. ta1 bing4 le0 yi1 ge4 xing1qi1 ?he was ill for one week?.",
        "Process describes a temporal bounded dynamic state that has a potential starting point and ending point, within which the dynamic state holds, e.g. ta1 pao3 le0 yi1 ge4 xiao3shi2 ?he ran for one hour?.",
        "Semelfactive is different from Process in that its durations is quite short and is usually perceived as instantaneous.",
        "In other words, the temporal boundaries of semelfactive is usually naturally determined.",
        "For example, ta1 qiao1 le0 yi1 xia4 men2 ?he knocked the door once?.",
        "There is no way to length the duration of the knocking action.",
        "However, a series of iterative semelfactives could form dynamic process.",
        "For example, ta1 qiao1 le0 yi1 ge4 xiao3shi2 de0 men2 ?he knocked the door for an hour?",
        "gives a reading of iterative knocks.",
        "For static state and dynamic state, we can only refer to their holding at a certain time point.",
        "In other words, delimitative and process describe the life cycle of a state.",
        "For example, ta1 bing4 zhe0 ne0 ?he is ill?",
        "and ta1 wan3shang4 jiu3dian3 de0 shi2hou0 zai4 pao3bu4 ?He was running at 9:00pm?.",
        "It is also possible to claim that in a certain period, which for some reason became the focus of a conversation, a state holds.",
        "For example, ta1 na4 liang3 tian1 dou1 bing4 zhe0 ?he was ill in that two days?",
        "and ta1 wan3shang4 jiu3dian3 dao4 shi2dian3 de0 shi2hou0 zai4 pao3bu4 ?From 9:00pm to 10:00pm, he was running?.",
        "In this case, they are also state rather than delimitative or process.",
        "The difference is that there is no information about the starts and the ends, while delimitative and process do.",
        "Accomplishment is composed by a process with a final state.",
        "For example, ta1 xie3 le0 yi1 feng1 xin4 ?he wrote a letter?",
        "describes an accomplishment composed by a writing process with a final state, i.e. the existence of the letter.",
        "The final state of an accomplishment could also be dynamic.",
        "For example, ta1 ba3 dian4nao3 qi3dong4 le0 ?he started up the computer?",
        "describe an accomplishment with a dynamic final state, i.e. the normal working of computer.",
        "Some Resultative Verb Compounds (RVCs) in Chinese can denote achievements.",
        "However, they are easy to be confused with accomplishment.",
        "Based on the representation, the difference of them is that accomplishment encodes the start of the dynamic process, while achievement doesn't.",
        "For example, ta1 xie3 wan2 le0 na4 feng1 xin4 ?He (write-)finished the letter?",
        "describes a DS change.",
        "To differentiate them, we can use the yi3qian2 ?before?",
        "test.",
        "As in this example, ta1 xie3 wan2 na4 feng1 xin4 yi3 qian2 ?before he finished the letter?",
        "refers to the period that includes the writing process.",
        "This means that 160 RVCs only focus on the final culminating point and are thus achievements.",
        "On the other hand, ta1 xie3 na4 feng1 xin4 zhi1 qian2 ?before he wrote the letter?",
        "refers to the period before the writing process.",
        "So, ta1 xie3 le0 yi1 feng1 xin4 ?he wrote a letter?",
        "is then an accomplishment.",
        "There is a counterpart for accomplishment, which is composed by an instantaneous dynamic process (semelfactive) with a final state.",
        "RVCs can also denote instantaneous accomplishment.",
        "For example, ta1 da3sui4 le0 yi1 ge4 bei1zi0 ?he hit and broke a cup?",
        "is an accomplishment composed by a semelfactive hitting action with a final state, i.e. the broken of the cup.",
        "Similarly, the final state could also be dynamic.",
        "For example, in ta1 tan2zhuan4 le0 yi1 ge4 shai3zi0 ?He flicked and putted a spin on the dice?, the predicate tan2zhuan4 ?flick-spin?",
        "is a compound that combines the predicate tan2 ?flick?",
        "and zhuan4 ?spin?.",
        "The whole event is composed by a semelfactive flicking and a final dynamic state of the dice's spin.",
        "Table 2 shows the seven event types with examples.",
        "Theoretically, there could be unlimited number of complex events.",
        "However, the notions listed here are important in that they are the lexicalized units which reflect the human's cognition of real world events.",
        "For the perspective of computational linguis-tics, discriminating all these linguistic events will be a fundamental step for deeper natural language understanding.",
        "2.3.3 The Neutral Aspect Some sentences don't include an explicit viewpoint aspect, e.g. without any aspectual markers.",
        "For example, ta1 kan4 xiao3shuo1 ?he read novel?",
        "can possibly denote different event types in different contexts.",
        "yi3qian2, ta1 kan4 xiao3shuo1 ?he read novel before?",
        "denotes an attribute of the subject that he reads novels, while da4jia1 dou1 hen3mang2, xiao3hai2er0 xie3 zuo4ye4, ta1 kan4 xiao3shuo1 ?Everyone is busy, children are doing homework, he is reading novels?",
        "describes a dynamic state.",
        "The aspects of these examples are given by the specified contexts.",
        "Such sentences are usually called with NEUTRAL aspect (Smith, 1991).",
        "In our framework, such sentences are ignored for now, unless the context can help the annotator to figure out the aspectual information.",
        "Semelfactive |?| ta1 qiao1 le0 qiao1 men2 ?he knocked the door?",
        "Delimitative |?-| ta1 bing4 le0 yi1 ge4 xing1qing1 ?he was ill for one week?",

        "The overall hierarchy is shown in Figure 1.",
        "Some traditional notions are kept in use e.g. accomplishment and achievement.",
        "However, they now refer to event types rather than verb classes.",

        "The second is the classification with the finer-grained categories.",
        "Before the experiments, we will first discuss the features that may help for the classification.",
        "4.1 Features As suggested in previous literatures (Siegel, 1999; Siegel and McKeown, 2000; Zhu et al., 2000; Cao et al., 2006), the following features are considered as important for event type classification.",
        "Main verbs and their complements including argument structure are the most important indicators to an event type.",
        "Negation of the main verb is a strong indicator for static state, as discussed above.",

        "zhe0 ?ZHE?, ?",
        "le0 ?LE?, ?",
        "guo4 ?GUO?",
        "and some aspectual light verbs, e.g. ?",

        "kai1shi3 ?start?, ??",
        "ji4xu4 ?continue?, ??",
        "ting2zhi3 ?stop?, ??",
        "wan2cheng2 ?finish?, are strong indicators for different event types.",
        "Temporal adverbials are also important features, which could potentially disambiguate neutral sen-tences, e.g., yi3qian2, ta1 kan4 xiao3shuo1 ?he read novel before?",
        "as discussed above.",
        "Frequency adverbs, such as??",
        "jing1chang2 ?often?,??",
        "ou3er3 ?sometimes?, etc., are indicators for habitual states.",
        "For example, ta1 jing1chang2 qu4 he1jiu3 ?he often goes for drinking?",
        "is a habitual state rather than a specific event.",
        "Modalities could be expressed by auxiliaries, adverbs, sentence final particles etc.",
        "in Chinese.",
        "Adverbs that modify the main verb, such as ??",
        "ke3neng2 ?possibly?, are important features for identifying modalities.",
        "Sentence final particles (SFP) and punctuation marks are also good indicators to evaluative modality.",
        "Since we don't maintain a dictionary for the above indicators, we use a general feature set including the dependency structure and the combinations of the dependent constituents.",
        "We suggest that the above linguistic rules could be reflected by the dependency structures, which could be captured by the classifiers.",
        "Meanwhile, the experiment result here is only to serve as a baseline for future comparisons.",
