        "In recent years, sentiment analysis has become an important area of research (Pang and Lee, 2008; Bollen et al., 2011; Liu, 2012).",
        "Sentiment analysis is concerned with extracting opinions or emotions from text, especially user generated web content.",
        "Specific tasks include monitoring mood and emotion; differentiating opinions from facts; detecting positive or negative opinion polarity; determining opinion strength; and identifying other opinion properties.",
        "At this point, two major approaches exists: lexicon and machine learning based.",
        "The lexicon-based approach uses high quality, often manually generated features.",
        "The machine learning-based approach uses automatically generated feature sets, which are from various sources of evidence (e.g., part-of-speech, n-grams, emoticons) in order to capture the nuances of sentiment.",
        "This means that a large set of features is extracted, out of which only a small subset may be good indicators for the sentiment.",
        "One major problem associated with sentiment analysis of web content is that for many topics, these data sets tend to be highly imbalanced.",
        "There is a general trend that users are willing to submit positive reviews, but they are much more hesitant to submit reviews in the medium to low ranges.",
        "For example, for the YouTube data set that we will use, we collected comments for YouTube videos from the comedy category, along with their ratings.",
        "In this data set, more than 3/4 of all ratings consist of the highest rating of 5.",
        "For other types of user generated content, they opposite may be true.",
        "Heavy skewing in data sets is challenging for standard classification algorithms.",
        "Therefore, the data sets generally used for research on sentiment analysis are balanced.",
        "Researchers either generate balanced data sets during data collection, by sampling a certain number of positive and negative reviews, or by selecting a balanced subset for certain experiments.",
        "Examples for a balanced data set are the movie review data set (Pang and Lee, 2004) or the IMDB review data set (Maas et al., 2011).",
        "Using a balanced data set allows researchers to focus on finding robust methods and feature sets for the problem.",
        "Particularly, the movie review data set has been used as a benchmark data set that allows for comparisons of various sentiment analysis models.",
        "For example, Agarwal and Mittal (2012), Agarwal and Mittal (2013), Kummer This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "2 and Savoy (2012), O?Keefe and Koprinska (2009), and Paltoglou and Thelwall (2010) all proposed competitive feature selection methods evaluated on the movie review data set.",
        "However, the generalizability of such feature selection methods to imbalanced data sets, which better represent real world situations, has not been investigated in much detail.",
        "Forman (2003) provides an extensive study of feature selection methods for highly imbalanced data sets, but he uses document classification as task.",
        "This current paper investigates the robustness of three feature selection methods that Forman (2003) has shown to be successful, as well as two variants of TF ?",
        "IDF .",
        "The three methods are Odds-Ratio (OR), Information Gain (IG), and Binormal Separation (BNS).",
        "BNS has been found to perform significantly better than other methods in more highly skewed tasks (Forman, 2003).",
        "The two variants of TF ?",
        "IDF differ in the data set used for calculating document frequency.",
        "We investigate the behavior of these methods on a subtask of sentiment analysis, namely the prediction of user ratings.",
        "For this, we will use data sets from two different domains in order to gain insight into whether or not these feature selection methods are robust across domains and across skewing ratios: One set consists of user reviews from Epicurious 1 , an online community where recipes can be exchanged and reviewed, the other set consists of user reviews of YouTube comedy videos.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we explain the rationale for applying feature selection and introduce the feature selection methods that are examined in this paper.",
        "Section 3 introduces the experimental settings, including a description of the two data sets, data preprocessing, feature representation, and definition of the binary classification tasks.",
        "In section 4, we present and discuss the results for the feature selection methods, and in section 5, we conclude.",
        "2 Feature Selection and Class Skewing In a larger picture, feature selection is a method (applicable both in regression and classification prob-lems) to identify a subset of features to achieve various goals: 1) to reduce computational cost, 2) to avoid overfitting, 3) to avoid model failure, and 4) to handle skewed data sets for classification tasks.",
        "We concentrate on the last motivation, even though an improvement of efficiency and the reduction of overfitting are welcome side effects.",
        "The feature selection methods studied in this paper have been used in text classification as well, which is a more general but similar task using n-gram features.",
        "However, since all measures are intended for binary classification problems, we reformulate the rating prediction into a binary classification problem (see section 3.5).",
        "Feature selection methods can be divided into wrapper and filter methods.",
        "Wrapper methods use the classification outcome on a held-out data set to score feature subsets.",
        "Standard wrapper methods include forward selection, backward selection, and genetic algorithms.",
        "Filter methods, in contrast, use an independent measure rather than the error rate on the held-out data.",
        "This means that they can be applied to larger feature sets, which may be unfeasible with wrapper methods.",
        "Since sentiment analysis often deals with high dimensional feature representation, we will concentrate on filter methods for our feature selection experiments.",
        "Previous research (e.g. (Brank et al., 2002b; Forman, 2003)) has shown that Information Gain and Odds Ratio have been used successfully across different tasks and that Binormal Separation has good recall for the minority class under skewed class distributions.",
        "So we will investigate them in this paper.",
        "Other filter methods are not investigated in this paper due to two main concerns: We exclude Chi-squared and Z-score, statistical tests because they require a certain sample size.",
        "Our concern is that their estimation for rare words may not be accurate.",
        "We also exclude Categorical Proportion Difference and Probability Proportion Difference since they do not normalize over the sample of size of positive and negative classes.",
        "Thus, our concern is that they may not provide a fair estimate for features from a skewed data sets.",
        "2.1 Notation Following Zheng et al. (2004), feature selection methods can be divided into two groups: one-sided and two-sided measures.",
        "One-sided measures assign a high score to positively-correlated features and a low 1 www.epicurious.com 3 score to negative features while two-sided measures prefer highly distinguishing features, independent of whether they are positively or negatively correlated.",
        "Zheng et al. (2004) note that the ratio of positive and negative features affects precision and recall of the classification, especially for the minority class.",
        "For one-sided methods, we have control over this ratio by selecting a specified number of features one each side; for two-sided methods, however, we do not have this control.",
        "In this paper, we will keep a 1:1 ratio for one-sided methods.",
        "For example, if we select 1 000 features, we select the 500 highest ranked features for the positive class, and the 500 highest ranked features for the negative class.",
        "When using two-sided methods, the 1 000 highest ranked features are selected.",
        "For the discussion of the feature selection methods, we use the following notations: ?",
        "S: target or positive class.",
        "?",
        "S: negative class.",
        "?",
        "D S : The number of documents in class S. ?",
        "D S : The number of documents in class S. ?",
        "D Sf : The number of documents in class S where feature f occurs.",
        "?",
        "D Sf : The number of documents in class S where feature f occurs.",
        "?",
        "T Sf : The number of times feature f occurs in class S. 2.2 Feature Selection Methods In addition to Information Gain, Odds Ratio and Bi-Normal Separation, TF ?",
        "IDF is included for comparison purposes.",
        "We define these measures for binary classification as shown below.",
        "Information Gain (IG): IG is a two-sided measure that estimates how much is known about an unobserved random variable given an observed variable.",
        "It is defined as the entropy of one random variable minus the conditional entropy of the observed variable.",
        "Thus, IG is the reduced uncertainty of class S given a feature f : IG = H(S)?H(S|f) = ?",
        "f?",
        "{0,1} ?",
        "S?",
        "{0,1} P (f, S)log P (f, S) P (f)P (S) Brank et al. (2002b) analyzed feature vector sparsity and concluded that IG prefers common features over extremely rare ones.",
        "IG can be regarded as the weighted average of Mutual Information, and rare features are penalized in the weighting.",
        "Thus they are unlikely to be chosen (Li et al., 2009).",
        "Forman (2003) observed that IG performs better when only few features (100-500) are used.",
        "Both authors agreed that IG has a high precision with respect to the minority class.",
        "Odds Ratio (OR): OR (Mosteller, 1968) is a one-sided measure that is defined as the ratio of the odds of feature f occurring in class S to the odds of it occurring in class S. A value larger than 1 indicates that a feature is positively correlated with class S, a value smaller than 1 indicates it is negatively correlated: OR = log P (f, S)(1?",
        "P (f, S)) P (f, S)(1?",
        "P (f, S)) Brank et al. (2002b) showed that OR requires a high number of features to achieve a given feature vector sparsity because it prefers rare terms.",
        "Features that occur in very few documents of class S and do not occur in S have a small denominator, and thus a rather large OR value.",
        "4 Bi-Normal Separation (BNS): BNS (Forman, 2003) is a two-sided measure that regards the probability of feature f occurring in class S as the area under the normal distribution bell curve.",
        "The whole area under the bell curve corresponds to 1, and the area for a particular feature has a corresponding threshold along the x-axis (ranging from negative infinite to positive infinite).",
        "For a feature f , one can find the threshold that corresponds to the probability of occurring in the positive class, and the threshold corresponding to the probability of occurring in S. BNS measures the separation in these two thresholds: BNS = |F ?1 ( D Sf D S )?",
        "F ?1 ( D Sf D S )| where F ?1 is the inverse function of the standard normal cumulative probability distribution.",
        "As we can see, the F ?1 function exaggerates an input more dramatically when the input is close to 0 or 1 which means that BNS perfers rare words.",
        "Term Frequency * Inverse Document Frequency (TF*IDF): TF ?",
        "IDF was originally proposed for information retrieval tasks, where it measures how representative a term is for the document in which it occurs.",
        "When TF ?",
        "IDF is adopted for binary classification, we calculate the TF ?",
        "IDF of a feature w.r.t.",
        "the positive class (normalized) and the TF ?",
        "IDF w.r.t.",
        "the negative class (normalized).",
        "We obtain the absolute value of the difference of these two measures.",
        "If a feature is equally important in both classes and thus would not contribute to classification, it receives a small value.",
        "The larger the value, the more discriminative the feature.",
        "We apply two variants of TF ?",
        "IDF , depending on how IDF is calculated: TF ?",
        "IDF 1 = (0.5 + 0.5?",
        "T Sf max i (T Sf i ) )?",
        "log( D S + D S D Sf ) TF ?",
        "IDF 2 = (0.5 + 0.5?",
        "T Sf max i (T Sf i ) )?",
        "log( D S D Sf ) In the first variant, TF ?",
        "IDF 1 , document frequency is based on the whole set of examples while in the second variant, TF ?",

        "On the website, each recipe is assigned a rating of 1 to 4 forks, including the intermediate values of 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5.",
        "This is an accumulated rating over all user reviews.",
        "(Reviews with ratings of 0 were excluded, they usually indicate that recipes have not received any ratings.)",
        "We rounded down all the half ratings, e.g., 1.5 forks counts as 1 fork, based on the observation that users are generous when rating recipes.",
        "Our experiments classify each recipe by aggregating over all its reviews.",
        "While a little more than half of the recipes received 1 to 10 reviews, there are recipes with more than 100 reviews.",
        "To avoid an advantage for highly reviewed recipes, we randomly selected 10 reviews if a recipe has more than 10 reviews.",
        "Recipes with less than 3 reviews were eliminated since they do not provide enough information.",
        "After these clean-up steps, the data set has the distribution of ratings shown in table 1.",
        "YouTube Data Set: Using the Google YouTube Data API, we collected average user ratings and user comments for a set of YouTube videos in the category Comedy.",
        "Each video is rated from 1 to 5.",

        "For the Epicurious data set, we perform stemming using the Porter Stemmer (Porter, 1980) to normalize words, and rare words (?",
        "4 occurrences) are removed.",
        "On the YouTube data set, we perform spelling correction and normalization because the writing style is rather informal.",
        "Our normalizer collapses repetitions into their original forms plus a suffix ?RPT?, thus retaining this potentially helpful clue for reviewer's strong emotion without increasing the features due to creative spelling.",

        "3.3 Feature representation Since our focus is on settings with high numbers of features, we use a bag-of-words approach, in which every word represents one feature, and its term frequency serves as its value.",
        "Different feature weighting methods, including binary weighting, term frequency, and TF?IDF have been adopted in past sentiment analysis studies (e.g., (Pang et al., 2002; Paltoglou and Thelwall, 2010)).",

        "Note that we did not test for number of features greater than 15 000 because of the computation cost, but we can see that the performance curve for different feature selection methods tends to conflate to the point that represents the full feature set.",

        "However, this is not completely consistent.",
        "4.3 Discussion If we compare the performance curves across data sets and skewing ratios and aim for high accuracy, we see that there is no single feature selection method that is optimal in all situations.",
        "Thus, we have to conclude that the choice of feature selection method is dependent on the task.",
        "In fact, the performance of a feature selection method could depend on many factors, such as the difficulty of the classification task, the preprocessing step, the feature generation decision, the data representation scheme (Brank et al., 2002a), or the classification model (e.g., SVM, Maximum Entropy, Naive Bayes).",
        "9 We have also shown on two different data sets, each with three skewing ratios, that it is difficult for feature selection methods to mitigate the effect of highly skewed class distributions while we can still improve performance by using a reduced feature set for slightly skewed cases.",
        "Thus, the higher the skewing of the data set is, the more difficult it is to find a feature selection method that has a positive effect, and parameters, such as feature set size, have to be optimized very carefully.",
        "Thus, feature selection is much less effective in highly skewed user rating tasks than in document classification.",
        "However, if the task requires recall of the minority class, our experiments have shown that TF ?IDF 2 is able to increase this measure with a small feature set, even for highly imbalanced cases.",
        "5 Conclusion and Future Work In this paper, we investigated whether feature selection methods reported to be successful for document classification perform robustly in sentiment classification problems with a highly skewed class distribution.",
        "Our findings show that feature selection methods are most effective when the data sets are balanced or moderately skewed, while for highly imbalanced cases, we only saw an improvement in recall for the minority class.",
        "In the future, we will extend feature selection methods ?",
        "originally defined for binary classification scenarios ?",
        "to handle multi-class classification problems.",
        "A simple way of implementing this is be to break multi-class classification into several 1-vs.-all or 1-vs.-1 tasks, perform feature selection on these binary tasks and then aggregate them.",
        "Another direction that we want to take is integrating more complex features, such as parsing or semantic features, into the classification task to investigate how they influence feature selection.",
        "In addition, we will compare other approaches against feature selection for handling highly skewed data sets, including classification by rank, ensemble learning methods, and memory-based learning with a instance-specific weighting.",
        "Finally, a more challenging task is to select features for sentiment analysis problems where no annotation (feature selection under unsupervised learning) or few annotations (feature selection under semi-supervised learning) are available.",
