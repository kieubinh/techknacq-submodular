        "Technology terms and their corresponding concepts are part and parcel of any system that tries to capture competitive technological intelligence (QasemiZadeh, 2010; Newman et al., 2014).",
        "We propose a method of technology term recognition (TTR) at a synchronic level, i.e., the identification of terms that correspond to technological concepts from a corpus of scientific publications.",
        "TTR can be viewed as a kind of automatic term recognition (ATR) task.",
        "The input of ATR is a large collection of documents, i.e. a domain-specific corpus, and the output is a terminological resource.",
        "The generated terminological resource embraces terms that signify a wide spectrum of concepts in domain knowledge represented by the input corpus.",
        "The extracted terms and their corresponding concepts, however, can be further organized in several categories; each category characterizes a group of 'similar' concepts (e.g. technology) in domain knowledge.",
        "1 TTR, therefore, goes beyond ATR and targets a subset of terms that characterizes the category of technological concepts in domain knowledge (Figure 1).",
        "Establishing a precise definition of technology -- and subsequently finding its corresponding terms -- is a fundamental problem studied in philosophy of science.",
        "The most simplistic definition of technology, perhaps, can be found in a dictionary.",
        "For example, Oxford dictionary defines technology as the 'application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes'.",
        "As to our understanding, technology terms signal concepts that involve processes -- a series of actions taken in order to achieve a particular goal -- e.g. as manifested in practical applications of a research.",
        "Consequently, technology terms should not be confused with other categories of terms, e.g. terms that signify research subjects or problems.",
        "2 For example, in computational linguistics literature, both 'language resource' and 'natural language processing' are valid terms; however, we only recognize the latter as a valid technology term.",
        "1 Or, contrariwise, a group of similar concepts can form a category.",
        "2 Even though, these category of terms are strongly correlated.",
        "For instance, a technology may provide a solution for a research problem and can be defined in the scope of a research subject.",
        "Therefore, it is important to note that a research problem or a research subject is not a technology.",

        "ATR targets the identification of valid terms amongst candidate terms.",

        "Text Candidate Term Extraction Scoring and Ranking Termhood Unithood Valid Terms Figure 2: Prevalent architecture of the terminology mining methods.",
        "3 In this example, 'language resource' signals artefacts such as lexicons and corpora.",
        "Although the process of creating these artefacts involves several technologies, we do not consider them -- and subsequently the term 'language resource' -- as technology.",
        "In the absence of an analytical answer to the question 'what is technology?', we suggest exploiting the context of terms in order to identify technology terms among them.",
        "We believe that technology terms tend to appear in similar linguistic contexts.",
        "By extending Harris's (1954) distributional hypothesis, we claim that the context of (previously) known technology terms can be modelled and used in order to identify new unknown technology terms.",
        "We thus take a distributional approach to the problem of technology term recognition.",
        "Consequently, we tie the context of terms to their meaning by quantification of their distributional similarities.",
        "We employ vector spaces to model such distributional similarities (Turney and Pantel, 2010).",
        "Consequently, the proposed method for TTR is realized as a term classification task in a vector space model (VSM).",
        "The proposed method employs the prevalent mechanism of terminology extraction in the form of a two-step procedure: candidate term extraction followed by term scoring and ranking (Figure 2).",
        "Candidate term extraction deals with the term formation and the extraction of term candidates.",
        "We employ a linguistic filtering based on part-of-speech (PoS) tag sequences for the extraction of candidate terms.",
        "Subsequent to candidate term extraction, a scoring procedure -- which can be seen as a semantic weighting mechanism -- is employed to indicate how likely it is that a candidate term is a technology term.",
        "As suggested in Figure 2, the scoring procedure in ATR usually combines scores that are known as termhood and unithood.",
        "Unithood indicates the degree to which a sequence of tokens can be combined to form a complex term (a lexical unit that is made of more than one token).",
        "Unithood is, thus, a measure of the syntagmatic relation between the constituents of complex terms: a lexical association measure to identify collocations.",
        "4 Termhood, on the other hand, 'is the degree to which a stable lexical unit is related to some domain-specific concepts' (Kageura and Umino, 1996).",
        "It characterizes a paradigmatic relation between lexical units -- either simple (made of one token) or complex terms -- and the communicative context that verbalizes domain-concepts.",
        "In this paper, in order to simplify the evaluation framework, we assume that the PoS-based approach to candidate term extraction implicitly characterizes the unithood score.",
        "The focus is thus on the termhood measure.",
        "We devise a termhood measure to distinguish technology terms from the set of extracted candidate terms.",
        "We assume that the association of a term to a technology concept (i.e. what termhood determines) is a kind of paradigmatic relation that can be characterized using the syntagmatic relations of the term and its co-occurred, surrounding words in a context window (Figure 3).",

        "In this VSM, we characterize the category of technology terms using a set of reference terms, i.e. previously known technology terms.",
        "Conse-quently, the proximity of vectors that represent candidate terms to the vectors that represent reference terms determines the association of candidate terms to the category of technology terms.",
        "This association is measured using a k-nearest neighbours (k-nn) regression algorithm.",
        "Figure 4 illustrates the method.",
        "In the proposed technique, finding context window's properties that best characterize technology terms is the major research concern that should be investigated.",
        "These properties are the size of the co-occurrence region, the position of a term in the context window and the direction in which the neighbourhood is extended (see Lenci, 2008).",
        "To find the most discriminative context window, we construct several VSMs; each VSM represents a context window of a certain configuration (i.e. size, direction and the word order information).",
        "We then examine the discriminative power of context windows by reporting the performance of the k-nn regression algorithm in these VSMs.",
        "Furthermore, to examine the role of the number of reference vectors in the performance of the classification task, we repeat these experiments using various numbers of reference vectors.",

        "For a corpus of a relatively small size, the context of terms can be represented and efficiently examined with the help of conventional vector space construction methods.",
        "The vector space is first constructed and then it may be followed by a dimensionality reduction technique.",
        "However, as the corpus grows and the number of elements that are employed for context definition increases, due to the high dimensionality of the vector space (orders of millions), these algorithms may suffer from low computational performance.",

        "The vector space construction is a two-step procedure: construction of (a) index vectors followed by the construction of (b) context vectors.",
        "In the first step, each context element (i.e. a PoS-tagged word in a context window) is assigned exactly to one index vector.",
        "Index vectors are high-dimensional randomly generated vectors, in which most of the elements are set to 0 and only a few to 1 and ?1.",
        "9 Once an index vector is generated and assigned to a context element, this information is stored so that it can be retrieved and used for later analysis.",
        "In the second step, the construction of context vectors, each candidate term is assigned to a vector of which all elements are zero.",
        "This context vector has the same dimension as the index vectors.",
        "For each co-occurrence of a candidate term (represented by the context vector ~v t i ) and a context element (represented by the index vector ~r w j ) in the corpus, the context vector for the candidate term is accumulated by the index vector of the context element, i.e. ~v t i = ~v t i + ~r w j .",
        "The corpus is scanned for all the co-occurrences of candidate terms and context elements and the context vectors are updated to reflect these co-occurrences.",
        "The result is a VSM that is constructed directly in the reduced dimensionality and represents candidate terms using the defined context.",
        "For instance, in the example given in Figure 3, the term ?information extraction?",
        "is assigned to a context vector.",
        "If a context window of size 3 that extends in both directions of candidate terms and discards word order information is employed, then each unique word in the rectangles, e.g. has, current, technology, the, been, etc., is assigned to a randomly generated index vector.",
        "The context vector is then obtained by the accumulation of these index vectors.",
        "If the word order information is encoded, then the appearance of each word at a certain position in the context window must be assigned to a unique index vector.",

        "As described in Zadeh and Handschuh (2014c), using the provided proofs in Li et al. (2006), it can be verified that the dimensionality of RI-constructed VSMs is determined independently of the number of context elements n (i.e. the original dimensionality of the vector space).",
        "It is, however, determined by the probability and the maximum expected amount of distortions in pairwise distances and the number of context vectors in the model (in logarithmic scale).",
        "The number of non-zero elements, on the other hand, is decided by the number of context elements and the sparseness of the VSM at the original high dimension (?)",

        "In our experimental setup using the contexts that are described in Section 2.4.1, the estimated non-reduced, original dimension of the vector space is between 700,000 and 7 million; 10 hence, we set 8 elements of index vectors to ?1.",
