        "Automated data mining of patents has had a long history of research, driven by the large volume of patents produced each year and the many tasks to which they are put to use, including prior art inves-tigation, competitive analysis, and trend detection and forecasting (Tseng, 2007).",
        "Much of this work has concentrated on bibliographic methods such as citation analysis, but text mining has also been widely explored as a way to assist analysts to characterize patents, discover relationships, and facilitate patent searches.",
        "One of the indicators of new technology emergence is the coinage, adoption and spread of new terms; hence the identification and tracking of technical terminology over time is of particular interest to researchers designing tools to support analysts engaged in technology forecasting (e.g., Woon, 2009; deMiranda, 2006) For the most part, research into terminology extraction has either (1) focused on the identification of keywords within individual patents or corpora without regard to the roles played by the keywords within the text (e.g., Sheremetyeva, 2009) or, (2) engaged in fine-grained analysis of the semantics of narrow domains (e.g., Yang, 2008).",
        "In this paper we strive towards a middle ground, using a high-level classification suitable for all domains, inspired in part by recent work on sentiment analysis (Liu, 2012).",
        "In aspect-based sentiment analysis, natural language reviews of specific target entities, such as restaurants or cameras, are analyzed to extract aspects, i.e., features of the target entities, along with the sentiment expressed toward those features.",
        "In the restaurant domain, for example, aspects might include the breadth of the menu, quality of the service, preparation of the food, and cost.",
        "Aspects thus tend to capture the tasks that the entity is expected to perform and various dimensions and components related to those tasks.",
        "Sentiment reflects the reviewer's assessment of these aspects on a scale from negative to positive.",
        "A patent application is required by definition to do three things: describe an invention, argue for its novelty, and justify its utility.",
        "The utility of a patent is typically defined by the accomplishment of a new task or an improvement to some existing task along one or more dimensions.",
        "Thus, a patent can be thought of as a positive review of a product with respect to specific aspects of its task(s).",
        "Indeed, the most commonly occurring verbs in patents include those indicative of components (?comprise?, ?include?",
        "), attributes (?increase?, ?reduce?",
        "), and tasks (?achieve?, ?perform?).",
        "Organizing keywords along these high-level distinctions, then, would allow patent analysts to explore terminological infor-This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",

        "Furthermore, given the interpretation of a patent as a positive review, it should be possible to identify the default polarity of measurable aspects in the context of a domain.",
        "For example, if a patent makes a reference to increasing network bandwidth, then this should lend support to the notion that network bandwidth is not only a relevant attribute within the patent's domain but also a positive one.",
        "Likewise, if a patent refers to reducing power con-sumption, then we might interpret power consumption as an aspect with negative polarity.",
        "For analysts trying to assess trends within a technology domain, tracking the occurrences of terms signifying tasks and attributes, along with their polarity, could help them characterize the changing goals and obstacles for inventors over time.",
        "The US patent office receives over half a million patent applications a year.",
        "These are classified by subject matter within several standardized hierarchical schemes, which permits dividing up the corpus of patents both by application date and subfield (e.g., computer science, health, chemistry).",
        "Since our goal is to support analysts across all domains, it is highly desirable to extract domain-specific aspects through semi-supervised machine learning rather than incur the cost of domain-specific knowledge engineering.",
        "To this end, we employed a bootstrapping approach in which a small number of domain independent features was used to generate a much larger number of domain dependent features for classification.",
        "We then applied naive Bayes classification in a two-step classification process: first distinguishing attributes, components and tasks; and then classifying the extracted attribute terms by their polarity.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "In section 2, we describe the system architecture.",
        "Section 3 shows results for two domains (computer science and health).",
        "In section 4, we present an evaluation of results and discuss issues and shortcomings of the current implementation.",
        "In section 5, we present related research and in section 6, our conclusions and directions for future work.",
        "2 System architecture 2.1 Corpus processing Our patent collection is a set of 7,101,711 US patents in XML-markup form from Lexis-Nexis.",
        "We divided the collection into subcorpora by application year and high-level domain using the patents?",
        "classification within the USPTO hierarchy.",
        "The XML markup was then used to extract the relevant portions of patents for further analysis.",
        "These sections included title, abstract, background, summary, description and claims.",
        "References, other than those embedded in the sections above, were omitted, as they contain many entity types (people, publications, and organizations) that are not particularly useful for our current task.",
        "The text of each section was extracted and broken into sentences by the Stanford tagger (Toutanova, 2003) which also tokenized and tagged each token with a part of speech tag.",
        "We then chunked adjacent tokens into simple noun phrase chunks of the form (ADJECTIVE)?",
        "(NOUN)* NOUN.2 We will hereafter refer to these chunks as terms.",
        "The majority of these patent terms fall into one of three major categories: Components: the physical constituents or processes that make up an invention, as well as the objects impacted, produced by or used in the invention.",
        "Tasks: the activities which inventions, their components or beneficiaries perform or undergo.",
        "Attributes: the measureable dimensions of tasks and components mentioned in the patent.",
        "To generate features suitable for machine learning of these semantic categories, we used a small set of lexico-syntactic relationships, each defined with respect to the location of the term in a sentence: prev_V: the closest token tagged as a verb appearing to the left of the term, along with any prepositions or particles in between.",
        "(cached_in, prioritizing, deal_with) prev_VNpr: a construction of the form <verb><NP><prep> appearing to the left of the term.",
        "Only the head noun in the NP is retained (inform|user|of, provides|list|of, causes|increase|in) prev_Npr: a construction of the form <noun><prep> appearing to the left of the term.",

        "(excessive, con-siderable, easy) These features were designed to capture specific dependency relations between the term and its pre-modifiers and dominant verbs, nouns, and adjective phrases.",
        "We extracted the features using localized rules rather than create a full dependency parse.3 One additional feature internal to the term itself was also included: last_word.",
        "This simply captured the head term of the noun phrase, which often carries generalizable semantic information about the phrase.",
        "Each feature instance was represented as a string comprising a prefix (the feature type) and its value (a token or concatenation of tokens).",
        "2.2 Classification For each term appearing in a subcorpus, the collection of co-occurring features across all documents was assembled into a single weighted feature vector in which the weight captured the number of documents for which the feature occurred in conjunction with the given term.",
        "We also calculated the document frequency for each term, as well as its ?domain specificity score?, a metric reflecting the relative frequency of the term in specialized vs. randomized corpora (see section 3).",
        "In order to avoid the need to create manually labeled training data for each patent domain, we employed bootstrapping, a form of semi-supervised learning in which a small number of labeled features or seed terms are used in an iterative fashion to automaticaly identify other likely diagnostic features or category exemplars.",
        "Bootstrapping approaches have previously shown considerable promise in the construction of semantic lexicons (Riloff, 1999; Thelen, 2002, Ziering, 2013).",
        "By surveying common prev_V features in a domain-independent patent subcorpus, we selected a small set of domain-independent diagnostic lexico-syntactic features (?seed features?)",
        "that we felt were strong indicators for each of the three semantic categories.",
        "The set of seed features for each category is shown below.",
        "Semantically equivalent inflectional variants were also included as features.",
        "Attribute: improve, optimize, increase, decrease, reduce Component: comprise, contain, encompass, incorporate, use, utilize, consist_of, assembled_of, com-posed_of Task: accomplish, achieve, enhance, facilitate, assisting_in, employed_in, encounter_in, perform, used_for, utilized_for We then utilized these manually labeled generic features to bootstrap larger feature sets F for domain-specific subcorpora.",
        "For each term t in a domain-specific subcorpus, we extracted all the manually labeled features that the term co-ocurred with.",
        "Any term which co-occurred with at least two labeled feature instances and for which all of its labeled features were of the same class was itself labeled with that class for subsequent use as a seed term s for estimating the parameters of a multinomial naive Bayes classifier (Manning et al., 2008).",
        "Each seed term so selected was represented as a bag of its co-occurring features.",
        "The prior probability of each class and conditional probabilities of each feature given the class were estimated as follows, using Laplace ?add one?",
        "smoothing to eliminate 0 probabilities: ?",

        "Using the naive Bayes conditional independence assumption, the class of each term in a subcorpus was then computed by maximizing the product of the prior probability for a class and the product of the conditional probabilities of the term's features: ( ) ?",
        "( ) Terms for which no diagnostic features existed were labeled as ?unknown?.",
        "Once the terms in a subcorpus were categorized as attribute, component, or task, the terms identified as attributes were selected as input to a second round of classification.4 We used the same bootstrapping process as described for the first round, choosing a small set of features highly diagnostic of the polarity of attributes.",
        "For positive polarity, the seed features were: increase, raise, maximize.",
        "For negative polarity: avoid, lower, decrease, deal_with, eliminate, minimize, reduce, resulting_from, caused_by.",
        "Based on co-occurrence with these features, a set of terms was produced from which parameters for a larger set of features could be estimated, as described above.",
        "We then used naive Bayes classification to label the full set of attribute terms.",
        "3 Results We present results from two domains, health and computer science, using a corpus consisting of all US patent applications submitted in the year 2002.",
        "The health subcorpus consisted of 19,800 docu-ments, while the computer science subcorpus contained 51,058 documents.",
        "A ?generic?",
        "corpus composed of 38,482 patents randomly selected from all domains was also constructed for the year for use in computing a ?domain specificity score?.",
        "This score was designed to measure the degree to which a term could be considered part of a specific domain's vocabulary and was computed as the log(probability of term in domain corpus / probability of term in generic corpus).",
        "For example, in computer science, the term encryption technology earned a domain specificity score of 4.132, while speed earned .783 and color garnered .022.",
        "Using a combination of term frequency (# of documents a term occurs in within a domain) thresholds and domain specificity, one can extract subsets of terms with varying degrees of relevance within a collection.5 3.1 Attribute/Component/Task (ACT) Classification The bootstrapping process generated 1,644 features for use in the health domain and 3,200 in computer science.",
        "Kullback-Leibler divergence is a commonly used metric for comparing the difference between two probability distributions (Kullback and Leibler, 1951).",
        "By computing Kullback-Leibler divergence ( ) between the distribution P of classes predicted by each feature (i.e., the probability of the class given the feature alone based on the term seed set labels) and the prior class distribution Q, we could estimate the impact of individual features in the model.",
        "Table 1 shows some of the domain-specific features in the health and computer science domains, along with the category each tended to select for.6 Using the features generated by bootstrapping, the classifier was able to label 61% of the 1,335,240 terms in health and 81% of the 1,391,402 terms in computer science.",
        "The majority of unlabeled terms were extremely low frequency (typically 1).",
        "Higher frequency unlabeled terms were typically from categories other than those under consideration here (e.g., john wiley, j. biochem, 2nd edition).",
        "The distribution of category labels for the health and computer domains is shown in Table 2.",
        "4 We found relatively little evidence of explicit sentiment targeted at component and task aspects in patents and therefore focused our polarity analysis on attributes.",
        "5 Similar to Velardi's use of ?domain relevance?",
        "and ?consensus?",
        "(Velardi, 2001).",

        "When terms were ranked by frequency, given a relatively relaxed domain specificity threshold (e.g., .05 for health), the top terms tended to capture broad semantic types relevant to the domain.",

        "Given the general nature of coordination, a similar approach could be used to find corroborating evidence for the classifications that our system produces.",
        "6 Conclusion We have described an approach to text data mining from patents that strikes a middle ground between undifferentiated keywords and rich, domain specific ontologies.",
        "Motivated by the interpretation of patents as ?positive reviews?, we have made use of generic lexico-syntactic features common across patent domains to bootstrap domain-specific classifiers capable of organizing terms according to their roles as components, tasks and attributes with polarity.",
        "Although the majority of keywords in a domain are categorized as components, the ontology puts tasks and attributes on an equal footing with components, thereby shifting the emphasis from devices and processes to the goals, obstacles and targets of inventions, information which could be valuable for analysts attempting to detect trends and make forecasts.",
        "In addition to more rigorous evaluation and tuning, future research directions include testing the approach across a wider range of technology domains, incorporation into time series analysis for forecasting, and mining relationships between terms from different categories to provide an even richer terminological landscape for analysts to work with.",
