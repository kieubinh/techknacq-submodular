        "As typical technical documents, Patents have proven to be suitable for automatic translation for its strict format and united writing pattern (Jin and Liu, 2011), and patent machine translation (MT) is one of the major application fields of MT.",
        "However, sentences in patent are known for their complicated structures with multiple verbs and prepositions.",
        "Some Chinese prepositions are used to change the original S-V-O order of sentences, such as ?",
        "(BA), which make it more difficult for reordering in Chinese-English machine translation.",
        "In ancient Chinese, these prepositions are mostly verbs or other notional words, and in modern Chinese they became grammatical markers after diachronic grammati-calization.",
        "Huang(1998) and Miao(2005) discussed the reordering function of these prepositions, and defined them as Logic-0 (L0) words.",
        "A linguistic study by Zhang(2001) shows that more than 20% Chinese sentences are reordered by the prepositions, including ?",

        "(BEI), ?",
        "(YOU) and ?(WEI).",
        "After analyzing sentences of 500 Chinese patent documents, we find that L0 words appear more frequently in patent texts.",
        "Sentences with 1 L0 word occupy 30.75%, sentences with 2 L0 word occupy 9.05%, and sentences with ?3 L0 words occupy 2.10%.",
        "Therefore, Chinese special sentences with L0 words are concerned in this paper, and we will present a pre-reordering model of these special sentences for patent translation.",
        "Figure 1 and Figure 2 show an example illustrating some of the differences in word order between Chinese and English.",
        "Figure 1.",
        "Chinese syntax tree of the example sentence This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "40 Figure 2.",
        "English syntax tree of the example sentence The example shows a Chinese sentence whose literal translation in English is: A/an YOU(L0) ultraviolet activate DE adhesive BA(L0) the sensor housing secure to the middle bracket housing.",
        "(????????????????????????????)",
        "And where a natural translation in English would be An adhesive activated by ultraviolet secures the sensor housing to the middle bracket.",
        "As exemplified by this sentence, differences of word order between Chinese and English are determined by BA and YOU, and they are in two different levels in the syntax tree.",
        "In order to produce a good English translation, we firstly identify L0 words in two levels, and parse the sentence into chunks with core predicate and L0 words.",
        "Based on the sentence parsing, chunks are reordered according to related rules, transforming Chinese special sentence into a word order that is closer to that of English.",
        "After integrating into a patent MT system running in SIPO (State Intellectual Property Office of People's Republic of China)1, our model performs better than the baseline system and Google Translate in an open test, and it greatly improves the performance of patent translation.",
        "After a discussion of related work in section 2 and an introduction to semantic features in section 3, we will discuss the reordering model in section 4.",
        "Section 5 presents the processing steps, and section 6 gives the experiment and evaluation.",
        "Finally we draw some conclusions in section 7.",
        "2 Related Works Nowadays statistical machine translation (SMT) is the most widely used method in MT field, and reordering approaches are proved necessary in SMT performance(Xia and McCord, 2004; Collins et al., 2005).",
        "Most SMT systems employ some mechanism that allows reordering of the source language during translation(Wang et al., 2007), and researchers find that reordering based on syntactic analysis are effective for handling systematic differences in word order between source and target languages (Xia and McCord, 2004; Collins et al., 2005).",
        "Although sentence structure of source language has been taken into consideration, most SMT systems make use of syntax information in decoding stage (Lin, 2004; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Quirk et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006, Huang et al., 2006).",
        "Wang et al.(2007) firstly incorporate a Chinese syntactic reordering method into preprocessing stage of a statistical MT system, and achieve a significant improvement in reordering accuracy.",
        "Zhang et al.(2007) propose a chunk-level method with reordering rules automatically learned from source-side chunks, it shows improvement of BLEU score and better computational efficiency than reordering during decoding in Chinese-English task.",
        "Genzel(2010) applies this approach to 8 different language pairs in phrase-based machine translation, and demonstrates that many important order transformations (SVO to SOV or VSO, head modifier, verb movement) can be captured by this approach.",
        "An automatic reordering model in preprocessing also works effectively in Japanese-English patent machine translation(Katz-Brown and Collins, 2008).",
        "However, existing methods face difficulties in Chinese-English patent translation.",
        "A Chinese patent sentence often contains multiple nested phrases with a number of verbs, prepositions and correlations.",
        "In addition to that, ambiguity of L0 words turns it more difficult for language parsers to make syntax analysis.",
        "Moreover, reordering rules can hardly be automatically learned from patent sentences with complicate structures.",
        "To deal with the long-distance reordering of special sentences in patent texts, 1 http://c2e.cnpat.com.cn/sesame.aspx 41 we must fully consider semantic features of L0 words, including their positions, correlations, functions, ambiguities and levels.",
        "With the identification of L0 words and their levels, we can parse and reorder a sentence more explicitly.",
        "3 Semantic Features A linguistic survey shows that S-V-O account for more than 75% of the world's languages, suggesting it may be somehow more initially ?obvious?",
        "to human psychology(Crystal, 1997).",
        "Both modern Chinese and English are S-V-O languages, however, word order in Chinese sentence is often changed by L0 words to emphasize a part of the sentence, or to make nuance of the meaning.",
        "Our work aims at reordering Chinese special sentences to organize phrases or words in English order without L0 words.",
        "We have defined 9 Chinese prepositions as L0 words in Section 1.",
        "To deal with the reordering of Chinese special sentences with these words, we use semantic features from the Hierarchical Network of Concepts theory (HNC theory).",
        "In the opinion of HNC researchers, L0 words and verbs are important clues of syntactic and semantic analysis(Jin, 2010).",
        "Therefore, we will introduce the features of L0 words and verbs in the following part.",
        "3.1 Types of L0 Words According to HNC theory, L0 words can be divided into 2 types, L01 and L02(Huang, 1998; Miao, 2005).",
        "Sentence 1 Tom eats a banana.",
        "Sentence 2 Tom BA(?)",
        "a banana eat.",
        "Sentence 3 A banana BEI(?)",
        "Tom eat.",
        "In sentence 1, we know that Tom is an agent, and a banana is a patient.",
        "Sentence 2 and 3 are expressing the same meaning in Chinese with L0 words.",
        "It can be seen that the two L0 words reorder the sentence in different ways, BA(?)",
        "just exchanges the location of the predicate and the object, while BEI(?)",
        "changes the sentence from active to passive voice.",
        "BA(?)",
        "is a L02 word, and BEI(?)",
        "belongs to L01.",
        "The types of L0 words are presented in Table 1.",
        "Types Members Semantic format Example sentence L01 ?",

        "Table 1.",
        "Two types of L0 words 3.2 Levels of L0 Words By comparing the syntax trees in Figure 1 and Figure 2, we can note that YOU(?)",
        "appears in a NP(noun phrase), while BA(?)",
        "appears independently in the sentence.",
        "To distinguish the two kinds of L0 words, we define a LEVEL value for L0 words according to their node locations in the syntax tree.",
        "L0 word as LEVEL[1] is a child node of S(sentence), while L0 as LEVEL[2] is a child node of NP.",
        "Accordingly, our reordering model includes two modules, the reordering of Sentence with L0 as LEVEL[1] and the reordering of NP with L0 as LEVEL[2].",
        "Therefore, we need firstly identify the level of each L0 word in sentences.",
        "3.3 Collocation with Predicates More than one L0 word may appear in a sentence, but each L0 is in combination with a certain predicate.",
        "As exemplified by the sentence in Figure 1, YOU(?)",
        "goes with the verb activate, while BA(?)",
        "goes with the verb secure.",
        "For this reason, L0 and its level can also help to determine the core predicate when a sentence has more than one verb.",
        "Predicates are also classified into 2 types according to their levels in the syntax tree.",
        "We give 2 simple English sentences to explain the 2 types, P1 and P2.",
        "Sentence 4 Bob tells(P1) me a secret.",
        "Sentence 5 A secret told(P2) by Bob is spreading(P1).",
        "42 As labelled in the 2 examples, P1 refers to the core predicate, and P2 is the predicate in a noun phrase.",
        "L0 word in level 1 is in combination with P1, while L0 word in level 2 is in combination with P2.",
        "The identification of the two types of predicates is introduced in detail by Zhu(2012).",

        "With the identification of predicates, L0 words, and their levels (Hu et al., 2013), we can parse the sentence and get a Chinese syntax tree.",
        "In this section, we will firstly introduce the transformations and rules in the reordering, and then discuss how to transform the syntax tree to make the word order closer to English sentence.",
        "Semantic features of L0 and verbs that we discussed in section 3 will be applied into the model.",
        "4.1 Transformations in the Reordering There are 5 types of transformations in the processing of our reordering model.",
        "Deletion: L0 words are Chinese prepositions, so we need to delete or substitute them at first.",
        "Addition: Some L0 words have no real meanings, such as ?",
        "(BA) and ?",
        "(JIANG), we can make other transformations after deleting them.",
        "However, some L0 words have preposition meanings that cannot be neglected, so we need to add English prepositions to the new tree.",
        "This operation can also be interpreted as ?substitution?.",
        "Copying: In long distance reordering, some chunks do not need any transformation, so we just copy it to the new syntax tree.",
        "Rearrangement: We need to rearrange the chunks to make the word order closer to English.",
        "Voice Transition: A research by Liu(2011) shows that 95.6% English patent sentences use passive voice.",
        "Considering the voice difference between Chinese and English, we transform some active sentences to passive sentences.",
        "4.2 Rule Description The above 5 transformations are integrated in our reordering rules.",

        "as the boundary.",

        "The evaluation will use the development data for the NTCIR-9 Patent Machine Translation Pilot Task2, containing 2,000 bilingual Chinese-English sentence pairs.",
        "After integrating into a rule-based patent machine translation system(Zhu et al., 2012), we will take a closed test on the training set, and an open test on the evaluation set.",
        "To evaluate the effects of the reordering rules, precision and recall are calculated by manual evaluation for both two tests.",

        "Table 3.",
        "Experiment Result on the Training Set It can be seen from table 3 that the reordering rules have higher accuracy and reliability than cover-age, and the module of sentence reordering performs better than NP reordering.",

        "Compared Result of the Open Test The result of the open test shows that our model has effectively improved the reordering result of Chinese special sentences, and Google performs poorly in this test.",
        "It is mainly because statistical methods face difficulties in long distance reordering, and technical texts (including patent texts) account for a fairly low proportion in the training bilingual corpus.",

        "From the experiment, we also find that the pre-reordering model is strongly dependent on the completeness of rules and the accuracy of the knowledge base, which still need to be improved in the future work.",
