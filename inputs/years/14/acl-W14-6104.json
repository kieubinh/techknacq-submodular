        "Less-configurational languages such as German often show not just morphological variation but also free word order and nonprojectivity.",
        "German is not exceptional in this regard, as other morphologically-rich languages such as Czech, Tamil or Greek, offer similar challenges that make context-free constituent parsing less attractive.",
        "Advocates of dependency parsing have long pointed out that the free(r) word order and nonprojective phenomena are handled in a more straightforward way by dependency parsing.",
        "How-ever, certain other phenomena in language, such as gapping, ellipses or verbless sentences, are difficult to handle in a dependency formalism.",
        "In this paper, we show that parsing of discontinuous constituents can be achieved using easy-first parsing with online reordering, an approach that previously has only been used for dependencies, and that the approach yields very fast parsing with reasonably accurate results that are close to the state of the art, surpassing existing results that use treebank grammars.",
        "We also investigate the question whether phenomena where dependency representations may be problematic -- in particular, verbless clauses -- can be handled by this model."

        "Automatic syntactic parsing has been fruitfully incorporated into sytems for information extraction (Miyao et al., 2008), question answering, machine translation (Huang and Chiang, 2007), among others, but we also see syntactic structures being used to communicate facts about language use in the digital humanities or in investigations of the language of language learners.",
        "In all of these applications, we see fruitful use both of constituent trees, and of dependency trees.",
        "Depending on the application, different criteria may become important: on one hand, the ability to produce structures that are (intuitively) compatible with semantic composition, or where arguments and adjuncts are related to their predicate in the tree, which commonly requires dealing with nonprojectivity.",
        "Such a formalism should also deal with a wide range of constructions including verbless clauses.",
        "Finally, parsing speed is somewhat important for many application cases, and a parser that changes the tokenization of the input or inserts additional ?null?",
        "tokens runs afoul many of the fundamental assumptions in pipelines for semantic processing or information extraction.",
        "If we look at the current three largest treebanks for German, namely the Hamburg Dependency Treebank (Foth et al., 2014) with 101 000 sentences, the Tu?Ba-D/Z treebank (Telljohann et al., 2009) with 85 000 sentences or the Tiger treebank (Brants et al., 2002) with about 50 000 sentences, we see find a continuum of the nonprojective single-parent dependencies of the HDT on one side and projective phrase structures of Tu?Ba-D/Z, with Tiger straddling in the middle with a scheme that is neither projective nor limited to dependencies, and which represents, we?ll argue, both the best and the worst of both worlds.",
        "39 Because of its expressivity, the Negra/Tiger scheme has also been used for other languages such as Swedish Volk and Samuelsson (2004) as well as Georgian/Russian/Ukrainian (Kapanadze, 2012), and as Early New High German (Pauly et al., 2012).",
        "The Tiger scheme is arguably more expressive than either of the alternatives since it can capture both elliptic clauses (which are difficult to represent in normal dependency schemes) and nonprojective constructions (which have to be added as a second annotation layer in purely projective treebanks such as Tu?Ba-D/Z).",
        "It also makes it the most difficult to provide good automatic tool support, in terms of effective parsing components or of annotation tools, since parsing of discontinuous constituents has only recently become practical.",
        "The straightforward approach of Kallmeyer and Maier (2013) to use a treebank-derived linear context-free rewriting system suffers from near-exponential observed time consumption in practice.",
        "Approaches that use context-free grammar approximation such as the ones of Schmid (2006), Cai et al. (2011) or van Cranenburgh and Bod (2013), still have cubic time complexity; especially in the latter case, it is not clear whether techniques that allow fast PCFG parsing such as those of Bodenstab et al. (2011) would be suitable for the subsequent steps with increased grammar complexity.",
        "In this paper, we present a novel application of the easy-first parsing principle of Goldberg and Elhalad (2010) to discontinuous constituent parsing, which performs fast enough for interactive use (about 40 sentences per second) while giving an acceptable accuracy that is within the range normally seen with unmodified treebank grammars.",
        "In the remainder of the paper, we will include a short discussion of the interrelation between constituency and dependency relations of syntax, as well as relevant prior work in section 2, and discuss the construction of the parser in section 3.",
        "Section 4 and following contain a discussion of quantitative results on the Tiger corpus, whereas the penultimate section contains a more detailed analysis of the parser behaviour on constructions that are problematic for either dependency parsers or projective constituent parsing.",
        "2 Constituency and Dependency: Good friends?",
        "Constituency and dependency structures are two formalisms that are frequently used for theory-neutral description of syntactic structures.",
        "In constituent structures, usually influenced by some version of Xbar theory (see Kornai and Pullum, 1990 for a discussion; most notably, phrases are supposed to be projections of a head), whereas in dependency structures it is usually assumed that each word has exactly one governor (except one or more words that are attached to a virtual root node).",
        "The common subset of both can be described (in the words of Hockenmaier, 2007) as ?Heads, argu-ments, modifiers, conjuncts?, which includes the grammatical function labels that are added in dependency structures, and to varying extent in phrase structure treebanks.",
        "Nivre (2011) goes further and asks whether we need constituents at all, since pure dependency parsing recovers arguments and adjuncts while being generally faster (and, at least for results published on Czech and French which Nivre cites, more accurate).",
        "Versley and Zinsmeister (2006) similarly argue that even ?deep?",
        "dependency relations (including nonlocal ones) can be recovered from single-parent dependencies if subsequent disambiguation steps identify the scope of conjunctions, argument sharing in coordination, passive identification, and lexicalized control phenomena.",
        "However, verbless clauses as they may occur in coordination pose a problem to the idea that every phrase is headed by a preterminal, or the equivalent assumption in dependency grammar that every argument has a governing head word.",
        "In constituent treebanks, the solution to this problem is rather simple: deviate from the descriptive-Xbar schema outlined earlier on and introduce headless projections for these clauses.",
        "Dependency treebanks lack this additional degree of freedom, and the choice is usually to either attach the respective nodes somewhere else (Bo?hmova et al., 2001; Foth, 2006) or introduce empty nodes that are the governors of the orphaned subtrees (Bosco and Lombardo, 2006; Vincze et al., 2010; Dipper et al., 2013).",
        "In dependency parsing, good solutions for nonprojective edges have been found, including pseudoprojective parsing (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005), approximate weighted constraint solving (Koo et al., 2010), as well as deterministic online reordering (Nivre, 2009), which also has been applied to easy-first decoding 40 strategies (Tratz and Hovy, 2011).",
        "Seeker et al. (2012) additionally employs an attach-inner operation which allows non-projective insertion into a structure that has already been built.",
        "Despite these very reasonable solutions, the treatment of elliptic phrases, whether it is done using the somewhere-else approach or by introducing empty nodes (see Seeker et al., 2012 and references therein) yields uninformative structures for subsequent processing components or even makes it necessary to re-engineer subsequent processing stages for dealing with the newly introduced empty nodes, or (equally impracti-cal) require the refactoring of annotated corpus resources to accommodate a new tokenization whenever a null element is introduced or changed.",
        "In constituency parsing, the problem of discontinuous constituents in parsing has, at least in German, first been met with a proposals of raising degrees of complexity (among others, van Noord, 1991; Plaehn, 2000) and then silently been ignored both in the building of parsers and in their evaluation: researchers from Dubey and Keller (2003) to the present day cite bracketing scores based on structures that would make the reconstruction of ?Heads, arguments, modifiers, and conjuncts?",
        "?",
        "usually ?",
        "rather difficult.",
        "Only relatively recently has the problem of discontinuous constituent parsing been tackled head-on.",
        "Kallmeyer and Maier (2013) propose an approach that extracts a treebank LCFRS grammar, which is then used for probabilistic parsing, albeit with near-exponential time consumption.",
        "Maier et al. (2012) present an approach to make parsing in this approach more efficient by flattening coherent structures in a sentence to one single sentence node and thus eliminating scrambling as a source of discontinuities, together with other transformations, which allows a time complexity of O(n6) and parsing times of about 2 minutes for a 40-word sentence.",
        "van Cranenburgh and Bod (2013) use a more practical approach that first creates phrase candidates from the n-best list of a projective constituent parser, and uses these to construct LCFRS items that do not necessarily correspond to grammar rules seen in the training set, but which are then matched against a collection of tree fragments extracted from the training set.",
        "There exists some work on transforming dependency structures into constituents that may help in the recovery of discontinuous constituents: Hall and Nivre (2008) propose to encode information about node labels in the dependency labels, whereas Carreras et al. (2008) show that an ILP-based combination of finding dependencies and adding phrase projections and adjunctions to a dependency backbone works well for constructing structures matching those of the Penn Treebank.",
        "Seddah (2010) found that similar spinal structures can be used for the French Treebank.",
        "3 Incremental parsing In general, statistical parsing follows one of several general approaches: one is the approach of item-based decoding, which is centered around the creation of a parse forest that implicitly stores a very large number of possible trees, followed by either dynamic programming in the case of projective parsing (e.g. (Collins, 2003)) or techniques that provide an approximate or exact solution to the intractable problem in the case of nonprojective parsing with second-order factors (Koo et al., 2010).",
        "The second large group of approaches is based on incremental structure building, including the approaches of Magerman (1995) or Sagae and Lavie (2006) in the case of constituent parsing, or of Nivre (2003) and following in the case of dependency parsing, with approaches such as Stolcke (1995) or Huang and Sagae (2010) occupying a middle ground.",
        "While the idea of head lexicalization has played a large role in projective constituent parsing, there are rather few approaches that attempt to bridge the gap between dependency and constituency representations in a way that could be exploited for the efficient building of discontinuous constituent structures.",
        "Among these, both the approaches of Hall and Nivre (2008) and of Carreras et al. (2008) could be described in terms of a spinal transform: each terminal in the input string is assigned a set of governing nodes that form its spine; parsing then consists of assigning a dependency structure among the terminal nodes and of assigning spines and the relation to each other.",
        "In the remainder of this section, we describe two approaches that we used to perform nonprojective constituent parsing in expected linear time: one is relatively close to the approach of Hall and Nivre (2008), but instead of assigning nodes to the first terminal of their yield, uses a strategy more like the spinal tree adjoining grammr of Carreras et al. (2008).",
        "The other is an application of the principle 41 Zum einen on the one hand PP add?",

        "Because computed feature vectors can be memorized and only have to be recomputed in a small window around the last parser action, this latter approach, just as a left-to-right transition-based parser, has an expected time consumption that is linear in the number of words to be parsed.",
        "3.1 ADG: Constituency-to-Dependency Reduction Our baseline is an approach close in spirit to Hall and Nivre (2008): The tree with node labels is turned into a dependency graph that encodes, on the governor edge of each terminal, a combination of (i) the node labels on the spine of this node, and (ii) the level at which this node attaches to its parent's spine.",
        "We change two parameters of Hall and Nivre's approach: on one hand, we do not use the first terminal in the yield of a node as its representative but the head according to the head table that we also use to assign the head in the easy-first parser.",
        "The reason for this is a practical one: using the head, we get a distribution of 531 different spine/level combinations when we use the head, whereas we would get about 1525 categories when we use the first terminal.",
        "To ensure efficient parsing, this list is further pared down to 100 entries, with the remaining entries being replaced by an UNK placeholder.",
        "In decoding, terminals with these entries are assigned the most frequent combination of spine and parent category for the POS tags of the node and its governor, and the topmost spine node with a matching category (or simply the topmost one) would be chosen.",
        "The decoding algorithm and parameter settings for MaltParser were then determined using the MaltOptimizer software (Ballesteros and Nivre, 2012).",
        "The settings selected use the stack-projective algorithm with head+path marking strategy for pseudoprojective parsing.1 Hall and Nivre's approach is more complex than the approach presented here, and involves interleaving of identifying dependency edges (using the nonprojective Covington parsing scheme) and the stepwise determination of the topmost edge label, then the path of edge labels, and finally the path of constituent labels and its attachment.",
        "However, we find that this approach of dependency reduction constitutes a very reasonable intelligent baseline, and is able to perform at a similar speed than our approach.",

        "(Additionally, we collapse any two nodes with the same category embedding each other, which sometimes occurs in the Tiger treebank when several empty-headed phrases are assumed to embed each other in coordination).",
        "1MaltParser is able to do direct nonprojective parsing using the reordering approaches of Nivre (2009) and Nivre et al. (2009), however the pseudoprojective approach was selected in MaltOptimizer's parameter selection.",

        "We introduced the barrier formulation as an alternative to the lazy reordering of Nivre et al. (2009), which shows similar performance but which may reveal a closer connection to formalisms with restricted discontinuities.",
