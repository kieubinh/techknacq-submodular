        "The paper explores different domain-independent techniques to adapt a dependency parser trained on a general-language corpus to parse web texts (online reviews, newsgroup posts, weblogs): co-training, word clusters, and a crowd-sourced dictionary.",
        "We examine the relative utility of these techniques as well as different ways to put them together to achieve maximum parsing accuracy.",
        "While we find that co-training and word clusters produce the most promising results, there is little additive improvement when combining the two techniques, which suggests that in the absence of large grammatical discrepancies between the training and test domains, they address largely the same problem, that of unknown vocabulary, with word clusters being a somewhat more effective solution for it.",
        "Our highest results were achieved by a combination of word clusters and co-training, significantly improving on the baseline, by up to 1.67%.",
        "Evaluation of the best configurations on the SANCL-2012 test data (Petrov and McDonald, 2012) showed that they outperform all the shared task submissions that used a single parser to parse test data, averaging the results across all the test sets."

        "Domain adaptation of a statistical dependency parser is a problem that is of much importance for many practical NLP applications.",
        "Previous research has shown that the accuracy of parsing significantly drops when a general-language model is applied to narrow domains like financial news (Gildea, 2001), biomedical texts (Lease and Charniak, 2005), web data (Petrov and McDonald, 2012), or patents (Burga et al., 2013).",
        "In a preliminary experiment, we looked at the effect of cross-domain parsing on three state-of-the-art parsers ?",

        "trained on the CoNLL09 dataset and tested on texts from different domains in the OntoNotes v5.0 corpus as well as the in-domain CoNLL09 test set.",
        "The results (see Table 1) indicate that depending on the application domain, the parsing accuracy can suffer an absolute drop of as much as 16%.",

        "54 parsed during parser testing.",
        "In addition, a certain amount of unlabelled target domain texts may be available that can be leveraged in this or that way to facilitate domain adaptation.",
        "To address the problem of domain adaption, previous work focused on weakly supervised methods to re-train parsers on automatically parsed out-of-domain texts, through techniques such as co-training (Sarkar, 2001; Steedman et al., 2003), self-training (McClosky and Charniak, 2008; Rehbein, 2011), and uptraining (Petrov et al., 2010); selecting or weighting sentences from annotated in-domain data that fit best with the target domain (Plank and Van Noord, 2011; S?gaard and Plank, 2012; Khan et al., 2013b).",
        "Another line of research aims specifically to overcome the lexical gap between the training data and the target domain texts.",
        "These approaches include techniques such as text pre-processing and normalization (Foster, 2010), the use of external lexica and morphological clues to predict PoS tags of unknown target domain words (Szolovits, 2003; Pyysalo et al., 2006), discrete or continuous word clusters computed from unlabelled target domain texts (Candito et al., 2011; Bansal et al., 2014), selectional preferences modelled from word co-occurrences obtained from unannotated texts (Zhou et al., 2011).",
        "The goal of this paper is to investigate a combination of such techniques to adapt a general-language parser to parse web data (weblogs, online reviews, newsgroups, and answers) without resorting to manual annotation.",
        "In our study we include several techniques that have been shown to be reasonably effective for domain adaptation: text normalization, the use of word clusters, an external crowd-sourced lexicon, as well as automatically annotated texts produced with the help of co-training.",
        "All these techniques are domain-independent and can be applied to new target domains given unlabelled texts form these domains.",
        "We explore the relative utility of these methods and ways to combine them for maximum parser accuracy.",
        "2 Related work 2.1 Text normalization User-generated content on the web is notoriously low-quality, containing slang, abbreviations, inconsistent grammar and spelling.",
        "Foster (2010) investigated lexical phenomena that appear on online discussion forums that present common problems for parsing and compiled a list of such phenomena along with their transformations.",
        "Applying the transformations to test sentences helped to bring the F-score up by 2.7%.",
        "A similar approach was taken by Khan et al. (2013a) who found that it performed better than spelling correction based on the Levenshtein distance.",
        "Gadde et al. (2011) use a word clustering method and language modelling in order to align misspelled words with their regular spelling.",
        "Their method of cleaning noisy text helped to increase the accuracy of PoS tagging of SMS data by 3.5%.",
        "2.2 External lexica To adapt the Link parser to the medical domain, Szolovitz (2003) extended its lexicon with terms from the UMLS Specialist Lexicon.",
        "Pyysalo et al. (2006) take the same approach and together with predicting the PoS tags for out-of-vocabulary words based on their morphology this allowed them to achieve a 10% reduction in the error rate of parsing.",
        "External lexica have also been used to improve out-of-domain PoS tagging (Li et al., 2012).",
        "2.3 Word clusters In order to reduce the amount of annotated data to train a dependency parser, Koo et al. (2008) used word clusters computed from unlabelled data as features for training a parser.",
        "The same approach has proved to be effective for out-of-domain parsing, where there are many words in the test data unseen during training, and word clusters computed from in-domain data similarly help to deal with the vocabulary discrepancies between the training and test datasets.",
        "Discrete word clusters produced by Brown et al. (1992) method have been shown to be beneficial for adapting dependency parsers to biomedical texts (Candito et al., 2011) and web texts (?vrelid and Skj?rholt, 2012).",
        "Word clusters created with Brown clustering method have also been used to adapt a PoS tagger to Twitter posts (Owoputi et al., 2013).",
        "Bansal et al. (2014) introduced continuous word representations and showed them to increase parsing accuracy both on the Penn Treebank and on web data.",
        "55 2.4 Co-training Co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) is a paradigm for weakly supervised learning of a classification problem from a limited amount of labelled data and a large amount of unlabelled data, whereby two or more views on the data, i.e. feature subsets, or two or more different learning algorithms are employed that complement each other to bootstrap additional training data from the unlabelled dataset.",
        "Co-training algorithms have been successfully used in NLP tasks, and specifically for parsing.",
        "Sarkar (2001) showed the both precision and recall of a phrase structure parser can be increased using a co-training procedure that iteratively adds the most confidently parsed sentences from two different views to the training set.",
        "Steedman et al.(2003) used two different parsers that supplied training data to each other in a bootstrapping manner.",
        "A number of studies specifically aimed to use co-training for domain adaptation of a dependency parser.",
        "Sagae (2007) used two different learning algorithms of their graph-based parser to complete a one iteration of co-training, getting an improvement of 2-3%, which was the best result on the out-of-domain track of the CoNLL07 shared task (Nilsson et al., 2007).",
        "An interesting finding of their work was that the agreement between the two classifiers during testing was a very good predictor of accuracy.",
        "More recently, Zhang et al. (2012) used a tri-training algorithm for parser domain adaptation.",
        "The algorithm uses three learners and each learner was designed to learn from those automatically classified unlabelled data where the other two learners agreed on the classification label.",
        "3 Experimental set-up 3.1 Parsers In the experiments we included the Malt parser (Nivre, 2009), the MST parser (McDonald and Pereira, 2006), the transition-based Mate parser (Bohnet et al., 2013), and the graph-based Turbo parser (Martins et al., 2010).",
        "All the parsers were used with their default settings, and PoS tags used in the input of all the parsers were the same and came from the Mate parser.",

        "3.3 Data The experiments were conducted on annotated data on web-related domains available in the Ontonotes v.5 and SANCL datasets, since a large amount of unlabelled data required for most domain adaptation techniques is widely available.",
        "OntoNotes.",
        "In experiments with weblog texts, we used the CoNLL09 training dataset (Hajic?",
        "et al., 2009) as the general-language training data.",
        "The CoNLL09 test dataset was used to evaluate in-domain parsing.",
        "To create an out-of-domain test set, we selected the last 10% of the weblogs section of the OntoNotes v5.0 corpus1, in order to make the size of the out-of-domain test data comparable to that of the in-domain test data, i.e. of CoNLL09 test.",
        "The OntoNotes corpus was converted to the CoNLL09 format using the LTH constituent-to-dependency conversion tool (Johansson and Nugues, 2007).",

        "The average sentence length (in tokens) and the average number of subjects, roughly corresponding to the number of clauses in the sentence, aim to characterize the syntactic complexity of the sentences: the higher these values, the more complex the 1https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T19 56 structure of the sentences is likely to be.",
        "The ratio of word forms absent from training data describes how different the train and test data are in terms of vocabulary.",

        "A manual examination of the test data in both OntoNotes and SANCL has shown that in fact although it comes from the web it contains very few examples of ?Internet speak?.",
        "57 4.2 Word clusters We used Liang's (2005) implementation of the Brown clustering algorithm to create clusters of words found in unlabelled domain texts.",
        "The output of the algorithm are word types assigned to discrete hierarchical clusters, with clusters assigned ids in the form of bit strings of varying length corresponding to clusters of different granularity.",
        "We experimentally set the maximum length of the bit string to 6, collapsing more fine-grained clusters.",
        "Instead of replacing the original word forms and/or PoS tags with cluster ids as was done in some previous studies (Koo et al., 2008; Candito et al., 2011; Ta?ckstro?m et al., 2013), the ids of clusters were used to generate additional features in the representations of the word forms, as this also produced better results in the preliminary runs.",

        "Number of clusters.",
        "As an input parameter, the Brown clustering algorithm requires a desired number of clusters.",
        "Initially discarding all word types with a count of less than 3, we experimented with different numbers of clusters and found that an optimal settings lies around 600 and 800 clusters, which gives an improvement on the baseline of 0.9% for out-of-domain texts; but there does not seem to be noticeable differences between specific numbers of clusters (see Table 5, statistically significant differences to the baseline are indicated by stars2).",

        "We compared the accuracy achieved by the parser when the lexicon was supplied, as well as when the lexicon was supplied together with the best configuration word clusters (800 clusters built from the entire SANCL dataset after filtering words with the count less than 3).",
        "Table 9 shows results achieved with these settings in comparison to the baseline (improvements on the baseline are indicated with stars).",
        "When the lexicon is used on its own, we observe only slight gains on the baseline, on both in-domain and out-domain data, and neither are statistically significant.",
        "When combining the lexicon and word clusters, the accuracy actually decreases compared to using word clusters on their own.",
        "Thus the best combination of domain adaptation techniques so far included the use of 800 word clusters built from the entire SANCL unlabelled dataset, after filtering out word forms with the count less than 3, with text normalization, but without the Wiktionary lexicon (+1.15% on the baseline).",

        "5 Combining co-training with clusters and an external lexicon 5.1 OntoNotes test set We explored several possibilities to combine co-training with word clusters and an external lexicon, each time supplying word clusters and/or the lexicon to the Mate parser when it is being retrained on additional training data and applied to the test data.",
        "The following configurations of each of the techniques were used: ?",
        "Word clusters: 800 clusters generated from the entire SANCL unlabelled dataset, after discarding word types with the count less than 3. ?",
        "Lexicon: Wiktionary ?",
        "Co-training: Retraining the Mate parser on the combination of initial training set and 20k automatically parsed sentences (agreed by Malt and MST) which contained more than 6 tokens.",
        "The results showed that all three combinations failed to obtain significant improvements over co-training alone.",
        "The best result is achieved by combining co-training and clusters, which obtains an increase of only 0.09% on co-training; this is however, the greatest overall improvement on the baseline (+1.67%).",
        "The combination of co-training and a Wiktionary lexicon in fact harms accuracy (see Table 14).",
        "5.2 SANCL test set In order to compare different technique combinations with the results achieved by participants of the SANCL-2012 shared task, we evaluated them on the SANCL test set5.",
        "As the results in Table 15 indicate, similarly to the results on OntoNotes, word clusters usually fare much better than the Wiktionary-based lexicon, while the latter fails to produce statistically significant 5Note that the data was annotated in the Stanford format.",

        "The best accuracy overall was achieved by combinations of techniques, in all the three subdomains, improving on the baseline by up to 1.3%.",
        "Comparing the results achieved by our best configurations with the results of the shared task, we see that our labelled accuracy averaged across the subdomains was just above the Stanford-2 system (80.31 vs. 80.25), which ranked 5th of all the twelve submissions (Petrov and McDonald, 2012).",
        "Although our results are still 3.15% lower than DCU-Paris13, the best system at SANCL-2012, the top four results were all generated by combination systems (Le Roux et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012; McClosky et al., 2012); our highest results only produced by the Mate parser, hence our best configuration achieved the best performance of a single parser.",

        "The results on both the OntoNotes and SANCL datasets show that on their own, word clusters and co-training often improve significantly on the baseline, but their combination results only in minor further improvements (only up to 0.32%).",
        "Word clusters aim specifically to deal with the unknown vocabulary problem, and, since there seem to be no major grammatical differences between the train and test domains (see Section 3.3), it is likely that the main benefit derived from co-training is the compensation for unknown domain vocabulary.",
        "Word clusters also seem a better way to approach this problem: they perform better than co-training on three out of four subdomains.",
        "The explanation that unknown vocabulary is the main issue for domain adaptation in this domain pair is further supported by the fact that combinations of word clusters with a Wiktionary lexicon sometimes performed better than combinations involving co-training (on newsgroups and reviews).",
        "6 Conclusion In this paper we described experiments with several domain adaptation techniques, in order to quickly adapt a general-language parser to parse web data.",
        "We find that the best combination of the techniques improves significantly on the baseline (up to 1.67%), and achieves very promising results on the SANCL-2012 shared task data, outperforming all submissions that used a single parser, in terms of labelled accuracy score averaged across three test sets.",
        "62 Our experiments with word clusters showed that word clusters derived from unlabelled domain texts consistently contribute to a greater parsing accuracy, and that both the domain relevance of the unlabelled data and its quantity are major factors for successful exploitation of word clusters.",
        "Experiments with a crowd-sourced PoS lexicon however were not as conclusive: whereas supplying the lexicon to the parser often resulted in certain accuracy gains, they were not as large as those for word clusters.",
        "This suggests word clusters created automatically from relevant domain texts are a better tool to deal with unknown vocabulary than a generic hand-crafted and wide-coverage lexicon.",
        "Another interesting finding was that co-training was most effective when the evaluation parser was not used for creating extra training data (the so-called tri-training technique), and when removing very short sentences from automatically labelled data before re-training the evaluation parser.",
        "With respect to combining co-training with word clusters, we could not find clear evidence for additive improvement.",
        "This suggests that co-training solves largely the same problem as word clusters, i.e., unknown target domain vocabulary, and that for the web texts under study unknown vocabulary is a much more significant impediment for domain adaptation than grammatical differences between domains.",
