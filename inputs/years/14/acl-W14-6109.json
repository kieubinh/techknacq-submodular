        "This work describes experiments for statistical dependency parsing using a recently extended dependency treebank for Greek, a language with a moderately rich morphology.",
        "Relatively small training resources like the one we use here can set severe sparsity obstacles for languages with flexible word order and a relatively rich morphology like Greek.",
        "This work presents ongoing efforts for evaluating ways of improving this situation.",
        "The rest of this paper is structured as follows: We describe the treebank and the tools for preprocessing it in section 2.",
        "After mentioning some relevant work, we present in section 4 different settings for experiments involving manually validated and automatically pre-processed data for morphology and lemmas.",
        "In section 5we include a comparison of the output of twowell-known statistical parsers in reference to a set of criteria.",
        "Section 6 describes work on using sentences from relatively large auto-parsed resources as additional training data.",
        "2 Treebank We use the Greek Dependency Treebank (Prokopidis et al., 2005) for all experiments.",
        "GDT includes texts from open-content sources and from corpora collected in the framework of research projects aiming at multilingual, multimedia information extraction.",
        "A first version of the GDT (GDT-2007) contained 70223 tokens and 2902 sentences, and it was used in the CoNLL 2007 Shared Task on Dependency Parsing (Nivre et al., 2007a).",
        "A recently extended version of the resource (henceforth GDT-2014) amounts to 130753 tokens (including punctuation) and 5668 sentences.",
        "The current version of the resource contains 21827 unique types, 11005 lemmas and 10348 hapax legomena (excluding dates, digits and proper names).",
        "The average sentence length is 23.07 tokens.",
        "GDT consists of 249 whole documents and can thus be used for the annotation of other, possibly inter-sentential, relations like coreference.",
        "Each document has 22.76 sentences on average.",
        "The dependency-based annotation scheme used for the syntactic layer of the GDT is based on an adaptation of the guidelines for the Prague Dependency Treebank (B?hmov?",
        "et al., 2003), and allows for intuitive representations of long-distance dependencies and non-configurational structures common in languages with flexible word order.",
        "Most trees are headed by a word that bears the Pred relation to an artificial root node.",
        "Other tokens depending on this root node include sentence-final punctuation marks",

        "Coordinating conjunctions and apposition markers head participating tokens in relevant constructions.",
        "Table 1 contains some of the most common dependency relations used in the treebank, while Figure 1 presents a sentence fragment that contains a non-projective arc connecting the verb of a complement clause and its extraposed argument.",
        "In GDT-2014, 12.86% of the trees include at least one non-projective arc.",
        "The relatively free word order of Greek can be inferred when examining typical head-dependent structures in the resource.",
        "Although nouns are almost always preceded by determiners and adjectives, the situation is different for arguments of verbs.",
        "Of the 5414 explicit subjects in GDT, 31% occur to the right of their parent.",

        "Of those subjects and objects appearing in ?non-canonical?",
        "positions, 21% and 31%, respectively, are of neuter gender.",
        "This fact can pose problems to parsing, since the case of nominative and accusative neuter homographs is particularly difficult to disambiguate, especially due to the fact that articles and adjectives often preceding them (e.g.",
        "?",

        "Verb tags include features for tense and aspect, while articles are distinguished for definiteness.",
        "Manual annotation at these levels allows to examine how the parser's accuracy is affected in realistic, automatic pre-processing scenarios.",
        "In these settings, POS tagging is conducted with a tagger (Papa- georgiou et al., 2000) trained on a manually annotated corpus of Greek texts amounting to 455K tokens.",
        "During automatic processing, the tagger assigns to each token the most frequent tag in a lexicon compiled from the training corpus.",
        "A list of suffixes guides initial tagging of unknown words.",
        "When all tokens have been assigned a tag, a set of about 800 contextual rules learned during training, is applied to correct initial decisions.",
        "The tagger's accuracy reaches 97.49 when only basic POS is considered.",
        "When all features (including, for example, gender and case for nouns, and aspect and tense for verbs) are taken into account, the tagger's accuracy drops to 92.54.",
        "As an indication of the relatively rich morphology of Greek, the tags/word ratio in the tagger's lexicon is 1.82.",
        "Tags for a word typically differ in only one or two features like case and gender for adjectives.",
        "However, distinct basic parts of speech (e.g. Vb/No) is also a possibility.",

        "In this partitioning scheme, unknown tokens and lemmas when parsing the test set are 27% and 16%, respectively.",
        "We performed experiments with the transition-based Maltparser (Nivre et al., 2007b) and the graph-based Mateparser (Bohnet, 2010).",
        "For Maltparser, a 5- fold cross validation on the training set using MaltOptimizer (Ballesteros and Nivre, 2012) resulted in the selection of the non-projective stacklazy parsing algorithm as the one yielding an average best 78.96 LAS.",

        "We observe a better 79.74 LAS with Mateparser with a larger difference in UAS than in LACC (2.37 vs 1.26).",
        "This may suggest that the two parsers agree on the labels they assign but differ more in discovering node heads.",
        "Not surprisingly, testing in a more realistic scenario of using automatic PoS, features and lemmas produces more errors (Figure 2).",
        "Maltparser shows a relatively smaller decrease in accuracy (-3.05 vs -3.45) in this context.",
        "In the next two experiments with Mateparser, we see that in automatic pre-processing scenarios, the tagger clearly contributes more to error increase (-3.34) compared to the lemmatizer (-0.06).",
        "We also trained Mateparser in the MPL setting with POS tagsets of varying granularity, by removing features that were intuitively deemed to increase sparsity without contributing to parsing accuracy.",
        "More specifically, we experimented with several combinations of removing for aspect and tense of verbs, gender of nominal elements, definiteness of articles and degree of adjectives.",
        "A best LAS of 80.16 (cf. the two final columns of Table 4) was observed after removing features for degree and definiteness.",

        "In Figure 5 we see that Mate's LAS is better for all basic parts of speech.",
        "The difference is more evident for verbs, which are typically involved in longer dependencies.",
        "Finally, it is clear from Figure 6 that certain relations are particularly difficult for both parsers.",
        "For example, indirect object (IObj) dependents are low scoring nodes: this is because they are often attached to the correct head but are mislabeled as adverbial dependents (Adv) or plain objects (Obj).",
        "Dependents labeled as ellipsis (ExD) or heading appositional (Apos) constructions are also more error-prone.",
        "The same applies to nodes involved in coordinate structures as subjects headed by coordinative conjuctions (Sb_Co).",
        "The latter show an almost 0.3 drop in F1-score in comparison to simple subjects (Sb).",
        "In the APL setting, errors by both parsers often involve some type of interaction between the relatively free order of Greek sentences and the case feature of nominal homographs.",
        "For example, in the case of the sentence ??????????",
        "?/different ???????",
        "?/figures ?????",
        "?/provide ????",
        "?/three ???????",

        "?/sources ??",
        "?/on ??",
        "?/the ??????",
        "?/unemployment (Three official sources provide different figures on unemployment), the two nominal arguments of the verb and all of their modifiers are ambiguous as far as case (Nominative/Accusative) is concerned.",
        "Both nominal arguments also agree with the verb in number.",
        "These facts, in combination with the OVS order of this and similar fragments present serious challenges to both the tagger and the parsers.",
        "In contrast, the case of the noun ??????",
        "?/unemployment is easier for the tagger to disambiguate based on the preposition+article combination preceding it.",
        "However, attaching the whole subtree headed by the preposition is also problematic: it is part of a non-projective construction that would probably be disallowed in languages with a more strict order.",
        "94 6 Use of autoparsed data Following recent efforts in exploiting automatically processed data in training (Chen et al., 2012) and in accelerating treebank creation (Lynn et al., 2012), we conducted an experiment in extending the training set with similar material.",
        "We used a corpus of 66 million tokens, obtained by crawling (Papavassiliou et al., 2013) the 2009-2012 online archive of a Greek daily newspaper.",
        "We used models induced in theMPL experiment to parse all documents in the data pool with both parsers.",
        "We then appended to the original training set 30K randomly selected parsed sentences of 10 to 30 tokens length, for which identical trees were generated by both parsers.",
        "After retraining both parsers and testing on the APL test set, we observed (columns 8 and 9 of table 4) absolute LAS improvements of 0.68 and 0.52 for Maltparser andMateparser.",
        "7 Conclusions and future work We described a set of experiments for dependency parsing of Greek using Maltparser and Mateparser, two well known representatives of the transition and graph-based families of parsers.",
        "Mateparser has exhibited the best accuracy on the test partition of a recently expanded version of the Greek Dependency Treebank, with Maltparser yielding higher scores on shorter sentences.",
        "After appending auto-parsed data to a training set manually validated for POS and lemmas, we observed small accuracy improvements that show room for improvement.",
        "Scores obtained by training on datasets of different sizes in Section 4 probably indicate that apart from adding only documents or document fragments to the treebank, we should also consider selecting specific sentences for annotation, after measuring their informativeness and representativeness.",
        "In ongoing work, we are investigating ways of selecting sentences for manual annotation based on how much two or more parsers disagree, in combination with criteria like number of coordination/subordination elements and/or number of OOV words.",
        "For this purpose, we will also experiment with more members of the two parser families.",
        "Our best LAS scores were obtained after mapping certain morphological features to default values.",
        "Since these tagset mappings may not be the most efficient ones, we plan to investigate automatic techniques for selecting optimal feature combinations.",
        "Another line of research will be investigating semi-automatically mapping to different annotation schemes like the one proposed in McDonald et al. (2013).",
        "Finally, we plan to examine, as an additional source for resource expansion and domain adaptation, sentences from automatic dialogue transcriptions and/or product reviews.",
