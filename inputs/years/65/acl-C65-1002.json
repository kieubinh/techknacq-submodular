        "As part of a broader effort to extend the existing traditional part-of-speech classification in modern Russian, this study of verbs is oriented toward developing an improved basis for syntactic analysis.",
        "Moreover, it is hoped that the refinements introduced will be of interest in content analysis.",
        "To this end, an extensive set of potential classificatory criteria has been selected, in the hope that eventually this categorization can be optimized and extended to other parts of speech.",

        "0 The Experiment",
        "The 514 verbs analyzed came from two sources: (a) a randomized sample of 370 entries ( 1 ) and (b) a list of the most frequently used Russian verbs ( 2 ) from which the first 144 entries were selected.",
        "The classificatory criteria, subdivided into two groups, are discussed in Section 1.",
        "1 below.",
        "Generally, each verb was taken in a particular meaning (stirat', for instance, as \"to erase\" and not as \"to launder\") and English equivalents used solely for purposes of identification.",
        "At the same time, for reasons of convenience, provisions were made in coding to allow for coexisting alternatives.",
        "Thus, for properties A and B there can be four possibilities which are represented by the following numerical codes: 1 - \"A\", 2 - \"B\", 3 - hAB\", 0 - \"neither applies\".",
        "After the verbs and appropriate codes were punched on cards, verbs with identical codes were compared.",
        "To obtain additional cluster - ing, a program, written by R. F. Hubbard for the IBM 7040, compared the code vector of each card against those of the rest of the sample.",
        "The distance between any two entries was calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of distance between corresponding positions in their code vectors as defined by the following table: Andreyewsky 2 0 0 0 0--2 4 1 1 =0 1--3= 1 2--3= 1 0 -- 1 = 4 0 -- 3= 6 1 -- 2= 2 2 --â€¢ 2= 0 3 -- 3= 0"

        "While the English meanings supplied do reflect certain semantic differences the main objective has been to test not only the ability of a given verb to co-occur with certain types of phrases (examples are used solely for illustration) or classes of adverbs but to trace what effect the verb has on their syntactic function, if any.",

        "As it turned out in practice, however, the metric did provide useful insights which can point the way toward developing a more powerful set of classificatory criteria.",

        "In addition to shorter groups described above, longer groupings were observed.",
        "Thus, otdokhnut' (to rest) (8) utikhnut' (to quiet down), and (10) ugasnut' (to become extinguished) or nabryzgat' (to sprinkle on), (2) nakinut' (to throw on), (3) vzvalit' (to pile on), and (4) nastrocit' (to sew on) are some of the examples.",
        "In other cases, apparently incongruous groups like the following: strekotat' (to chirr), (1) moshennicat' (to swindle), (5) fokusnichat' (to juggle), (5) nakrapyvat' (to sprinkle), (5) mertsat' (to twinkle) (6) zvenet' (to ring) emerged.",

        "At the same time, the evidence emerging so far suggests some subtle differences in the two tests.",
        "Basically, in both cases the results of the metric application show little or no discrimination between antonyms.",
        "However, the groupings resulting from Test II tend to be, if at all, held together by similarity of content.",

        "As far as potential application of the results obtained is concerned, especially the information derivable from Test I could be immediately put to use to improve (together with classification of nouns currently in progress) the translation of verb-governed prepositional phrases.",
        "It is likely that this syntagmatic patterning will extend to larger structures dominated by the verb.",
        "Further, if the apparent trends persist, some framework of semantic classification can be anticipated.",
        "To what extent this will be possible to accomplish by computers alone and the degree to which such a classification Andreyewsky 10 will satisfy the needs of computer processing remains to be established.",
        "While it can be argued that any classification is likely to produce some classes, we take solace in the fact that the methodology employed even in such classics as Roget's Thesaurus remains unknown to this day.",
