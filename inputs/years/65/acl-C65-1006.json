        "Mechanical translation research over almost two decades has led to a broader discipline, computational linguistics, which already includes within its concern the automated processes that collect, store, retrieve or communicate information conveyed in or about language, as well as translate one language into another.",
        "With progress in automatic classification, another possibility is being explored, that of creating new information rather than merely gathering, maintaining or distributing the results of human intellectual activities.",
        "Many investigators have noted that sophisticated linguistic systems must he capable of learning.",
        "A new term may be defined within a text being translated mechanically.",
        "Or, more commonly, a new meaning may be given a term used in close communication among colleagues.",
        "Bar-Hillel, for one, has waxed and waned in enthusiasm for mechanized linguistic learning, finally relegating even its investigators to the \"lunatic fringe\" of computational linguistics.",
        "Some thoughtful work has been done by Lamb [1] .",
        "Certainly Solomonoff [2] should be mentioned, as should Knowlton [3] and Sparck-Jones [4], but each for a different reason.",
        "There is hardly a literature to cite, unless it be that unruly assemblage we have come to call \"artificial intelligence.\"",
        "The name \"self-organizing system\" has also come into use.",
        "We will adopt it, so that \"learning\" and \"adapting\" may distinguish different kinds of self-organization.",
        "We observe, furthermore, that to process information one must first process the language (or symbolic system) Pendergraft, Dale It in which the information is given.",
        "As a consequence, every information processing system has a component that processes linguistic information.",
        "And that component, we now know, may have a subcomponent which processes metalinguistic information.",
        "Self-organizing linguistic systems properly fall within the scope of metalinguistic processing.",
        "The information being processed is about some language, the \"object-language\" of the communication; hence the vehicle by which the information is conveyed is a \"meta-language.\"",
        "If the self-organizing system has changed the description of the conventional alternatives available within the object-language, then we will say that the system is \"learning.\"",
        "Whether or not the alternatives remain unchanged, if some alteration has been made in the conventions of their use, the system will be \"adapting.\"",
        "Thus, roughly speaking, learning will involve some change in linguistic rules that describe a set of well-defined alternatives in the object-language.",
        "Adaptation will involve some change in a set of probabilities that describe how those alternatives are being used.",
        "A self-organizing information system, in contrast to one learning or adapting by metalinguistic processing, would employ linguistic processing to create new information about some subject-matter not necessarily linguistic.",
        "But since the information so processed might indeed be about language, we anticipate that linguistic self-organization may be based either meta-linguistically or linguistically.",
        "For the present, however, our system will be based on metalinguistic processing.",
        "Work in meta-syntactics Pendergraft, Dale 1-3 is progressing rapidly; researchers in computational linguistics now face the obligation of testing hypotheses more rigorously than with heuristic arguments or typical linguistic examples.",
        "More careful investigation is need in meta-semantics, i.e. in the relations between metalinguistic and linguistic information.",
        "In essence, then, we will try with automatic linguistic classification to bridge the gap between the design of language and the events of spoken or written discourse.",
        "What we have to report is only a small beginning toward that objective.",
        "We recognize that these are difficult problems requiring long-range commitments.",
        "They are nevertheless central to improving the language data used in automated analysis, synthesis and translation.",
        "Moreover, they lead to the concept of a dynamic language data base in linguistic processing.",
        "Already it is clear that the amount of information contained in a language description greatly influences efficiency in linguistic processing.",
        "Contrary to our former intuition, a simple description may merely be deficient in information so that the search in automated analysis will be extended unduly.",
        "There appears, furthermore, to be an optimal size in the syntactical descriptive unit.",
        "Thus, in making the transition from syntactical to semantical description (at least for the theories [5] we are studying), the basic question is analogous to that in the transition from lexical to syntactical description which gives rise to morphology: viz. what objects are to be classified?",
        "We are attacking these semological and morphological problems Pendergraft, Dale 1-4 within the same theoretical structure that determines how the resulting objects are to be classified.",
        "Indeed, the two questions appear inseparable.",
        "Pendergraft, Dale 2-1 BASIC PROGRAMS The Automatic Classification System (ACS), a Fortran IV programming package (7) based on the classification theories of Needham and Parker-Rhodes (8) has been developed by the Linguistics Research Center of The University of Texas (under support of the National Science Foundation and the U. S. Army Electronics Laboratories), and has been made generally available for classification research.",
        "The version of the system used in our own facility has been augmented with list-processing routines and other specialized programming which greatly increased its efficiency and data-capacity.",
        "ACS is a generalized classification system which can be applied to non-linguistic as well as linguistic problems.",
        "Its basic inputs are data describing the incidence (or the frequency of incidence) of particular properties upon particular objects.",
        "These incidence data may be transposed, so that either the properties or the objects can be classified.",
        "Various measures of the similarity between pairs of the objects (or properties) are available, permitting the incidence data to be used in computations of the connections between object (or property) pairs.",
        "Using these connection data, other routines group together \"clumps\" of objects with similar properties (or of properties occurring similarly in the objects).",
        "Various kinds of the clumps can be discovered.",
        "ACS has a section which controls the selection of similarity measures and clumping methods in classification experiments (6).",
        "To formalize the concepts of distributional classification, e.g. those investigated by Hockett (8) and by Harris (9) we have extended the general classification theory to binary as well as singulary relations.",
        "In linguistic classification these can be interpreted as constitutive relations (e.g. Pendergraft, Dale 2-2 concatenation).",
        "This interpretation, more exactly, assumes that the incidence data describe pairs of objects standing in that particular relation.",
        "Clumps of similar objects are then found in both the domain and counterdomain of the relation.",
        "Finally, individual clumps in the domain are paired with individual clumps in the counterdomain according as the connections between members of the two clumps are dense (in a precise sense) relative to the entire set of connections.",
        "Pairs of clumps may also be found by using a measure of relative sparseness in the connections.",
        "These capabilities have been added to ACS, and programming is being done to prepare incidence data mechanically from the results of automatic analysis in LRS (10).",
        "The automatic analysis algorithms in LRS are linguistically generalized, i.e. they will recognize the expressions of any object-language according to the exact specifications described in particular metalanguages.",
        "These language data, furthermore, are operationally generalized; they will be given relationally (solely in terms of relations and not as a process) so that synthesis as well as analysis algorithms may refer to the same descriptions.",
        "Object-language descriptions are conveyed by a hierarchy of metalanguages rather than by a single metalanguage (5).",
        "The complete data hierarchy will be given by lexical, syntactical, semantical and pragmatical meta-languages; the first three are currently available in LRS.",
        "Lexical, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic analysis (or synthesis) algorithms will be oriented to the corresponding levels of monolingual data.",
        "Analysis will affect a transfer to the next higher level of processing; synthesis to the next lower level.",
        "Automated lexical and syntactic analysis (as well as synthesis and translation) are operational in LRS, and the semantic algorithms will be later this year.",
        "All of the algorithms are parallel, stochastic, heuristic and machine-independent; that is to say, they have the following design features which we believe to be important in automatic linguistic classification experiments: Pcndergraft, Dale 2-3",
        "(a) They carry forward a search for all possible linguistic alternatives in parallel, instead of following to completion one sequence of alternatives before beginning another.",
        "As a result, all of the available linguistic evidence is represented in the analysis output.",
        "(b) They compute a probability for each linguistic alternative being processed.",
        "The probability will be the same in analysis or synthesis; it represents the likelihood of occurrence in the language rather than in the process.",
        "(c) They (may or may not, as a matter of choice) use the probabilities as heuristic criteria to limit the analysis output to the most likely alternatives.",
        "(d) They are oriented entirely to particular meta-syntactical and meta-semantical relations, not to the components of a particular computer.",
        "All processing decisions and results will be the same on every computer large enough to do the linguistic processing.",

        "The former, to be specific, have identical clump membership and are thus indistinguishable with respect to the particular constitutive relation described in the incidence data.",
        "The latter have common membership in a particular set of clumps and, as a consequence, share certain distributional properties which are represented by those clumps.",
        "Morphological classification, therefore, will involve the following basic operations within our theories.",

        "Our working hypothesis is that the morphological objects are those which maximize the connection entropy.",
        "This seems intuitively reasonable, since more or less homogeneous connections would be anticipated among objects Pendergraft, Dale 3-2 having elementary status.",
        "Conversely, a relatively strong connection between two objects would be evidence that they were parts of a single construct.",

        "A strategy chosen for automation must, above all, be computationally tractable.",
        "The two methods which Hockett calls the \"morph approach\" and the \"morphophonemic approach\" would have inherent advantages or disadvantages computationally.",
        "The \"morph approach,\" according to Hockett, supposes that morphemes are represented by morphs and that morphs are composed by phonemes.",
        "In consequence, the constitutive Pendergraft, Dale 3-3 relation (concatenation) must obtain between constructions of phonemes.",
        "By our hypothesis, a set of morphs would be any set of the constructions maximizing (perhaps locally) the connection entropy.",
        "And members of each identity class of the morphs would be the allomorphs of a particular morpheme.",

        "(d) If the entropy has increased, combine the (one or more, depending upon the rate of increase) strongly connected pairs into single constructs; return to (a).",
        "(e) If the entropy has not increased, perform singulary classification and find the component sets of morphs which will represent morphemes.",
        "Hockett's \"morphophonemic approach,\" in contrast, would take morphemes to be composed of morphophonemes and morphophonemes to be represented by phonemes.",
        "One interpretation of these relations in terms of the classification theories (among several) would involve the supposition that the members of each identity class of the phonemes represent Pendergraft, Dale 3-4 a particular morphophoneme.",
        "Consequently, any phoneme representing the morphophoneme M would be distinguished in the incidence data only as an M. A phoneme construct, similarly, would be distinguished only as the construct of represented morphophonemes.",
        "Any set of the morphophoneme constructs maximizing (maybe locally) the connection entropy would be recognized as morphemes.",
        "That these relations would call for a different computational strategy should be evident.",
        "Because of the higher level of abstraction, one might anticipate that (a) there would be fewer morphophoneme than phoneme constructs, and (b) the latter would occur more frequently than the former in the outputs of lexical analysis.",
