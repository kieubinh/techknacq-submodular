        "The RAND Corporation 1700 Main Street Santa Monica, California 90406 JUSTRACT A study was made of the degree of similarity between pairs of Russian nouns, as expressed by their tendency to occur in sentences with identical words in identical syntactic relationships.",
        "A similarity matrix was prepared for forty nouns; for each pair of nouns the number of shared (i) adjective dependents, (ii) noun dependents, and (iii) noun governors was automatically retrieved from machine-processed text.",
        "The similarity coefficient for each pair was determined as the ratio of the total of such shared words to the product of the frequencies of the two nouns in the text.",
        "The 780 pairs were ranked according to this coefficient.",
        "The text comprised 120,000 running words of physics text processed at The RAND Corporation; the frequencies of occurrence of the forty nouns in this text ranged from 42 to 328.",
        "The results suggest that the sample of text is of sufficient size to be useful for the intended purpose.",
        "Many noun pairs with similar properties (synonymy, antonymy, derivation from distributionally similar verbs, etc.)",
        "are characterized by high similarity coefficients; the converse is not observed.",

        "One of the goals of studies in Distributional Semantics is the establishment of word classes on the basis of the observed behavior of words in written texts.",
        "A convenient and significant way of discussing \"behavior\" of words is in terms of syntactic relationship.",
        "At the outset, in fact, it is necessary that we treat a word in terms of its Syntactically Related Words (SRW).",
        "In a given text, each word bears a given syntactic relationship to a finite number of other words; e.g., a finite number of words (nouns and pronouns) appear as \"subject\" for each active verb; another group of nouns and pronouns are used as \"direct object\" of each transitive verb; other words of-the class, \"adverb,\" appear as modifiers of a given verb.",
        "In each instance we may speak of the related words as SRW of a given verb, so that in our example three different types of SRW emerge; a given SRW is then defined in terms both of word class and specific relationship to the verb.",
        "(A given noun may of course belong to two different types of SRW, e.g., as both subject and object of the same verb.)",
        "Distributionally, we may compare two verbs in terms of their SRW.",
        "The objective of the present study is to test the premise that \"similar\" words tend to have the same SRW.",
        "This premise is tested, not with verbs, as in the harper 2 above example, but with nouns.",
        "Our procedure is (1) to find in a given text three types of SRW for a small group of nouns, (2) to find the number of SRW shared by each pair of nouns formed from the group, and (3) to express the \"similarity\" between individual nouns, and groups of nouns, as a function of their shared SRW.",
        "Another example: it might turn out that in a given text the nouns \"a\" and \"b\" (\"avocado\" and \"cherry\") share such adjective modifiers as \"ripe,\" whereas nouns \"c\" and \"d\" (\"chair\" and \"furniture\") have in common the adjective modifier \"modern.\"",
        "These facts would lead us to conclude that \"a\" and \"b\" are similar, that \"c\" and \"d\" are similar, that \"a\" and \"c\" are less similar, etc.",
        "A number of questions arise: What is \"similarity\" anyway?",
        "Do words that are similar in meaning really share a significant number of SRW in a given text?",
        "What is \"a significant number\"?",
        "Do not dissimilar words also have many common SRW?",
        "How much text is necessary in order to establish patterns of word behavior?",
        "What is the effect of multiple-meaning in words, and of using texts from different subject areas?",
        "The present investigation should be regarded as an experiment designed to throw some light on these questions; no validity is claimed for the \"results\" obtained.",
        "Our audacity in attempting the experiment at all is based on three factors: the possession of a text in a limited field (physics), the foreknowledge that the multiple-Harper 3 meaning problem is minimal, and the capability for automatic processing of text.",
        "(The latter is clearly a necessity, in view of the size and complexity of the problem.)",
        "The reader may well conclude that the experiment proves nothing.",
        "We would hope, however, that such an opinion would not preclude a critical judgment of the procedures employed, or the suspension of disbelief if the results do not correspond with his expectations."

        "The present study was based on a series of articles from Russian physics journals, comprising approximately 120,000 running words (some 500 pages).",
        "The processing of this text has been described elsewhere.",
        "(1'2) Here, we note only that each sentence of this text is recorded on magnetic tape, together with the following information for each occurrence in the sentence: its part of speech, its \"word number\" (an identification number in the machine glossary), and its syntactic \"governor\" or \"dependent\" (if any) in the sentence.",
        "A retrieval program applied to this text tape then yielded information about the SRW for words in which we were interested.",
        "For convenience and economy, all words in the machine printout for this study are identified by word number, rather than in their \"naturallanguage\" form.",
        "In our study we chose to deal with the SRW of forty Russian nouns, herein called Test Words (TW).",
        "The number Harper 4 is completely arbitrary; the particular nouns chosen (see Table 1) were presumed to form different semantic groupings.",
        "Table 1 gives one possible grouping of these words; the criteria for grouping are more or less obvious, although the reader may easily form different groups, by expanding or contracting the groups that we have designated.",
        "The only purpose of grouping is to provide a weak measure of control in the experiment: if two nouns are found to he similar in terms of their SRW, we should like to compare this finding with some intuitive understanding of their similarity.",
        "(For convenience, we shall refer to the TWs by their English equivalents.)",
        "Two nouns may be compared with reference to several different types of SRW.",
        "Here, we have chosen to limit our comparison to three types: the adjective dependents (in either attributive or predicative function), the noun dependents (normally, but not necessarily, in the genitive case in Russian), and the noun governors (the TN is normally, but not necessarily, in the genitive case).",
        "Strictly speaking, the syntactic function of the SRW should be taken into account.",
        "In ignoring this factor, we are consciously permitting certain inexactitudes, on the premise that the distortions introduced into measurement will not be severe.",
        "The task of manually retrieving SRW for each occurrence of the 40 TWs, and of comparing each TW with every other TW, is too tedious to be attempted.",
        "The aid of the computer was enlisted, in two ways.",

      "text": [
        "The evaluation of the data contained in our three machine listings is not an easy task.",
        "We can scarcely examine and discuss the degrees of similarity of 780 noun-pairs.",
        "The problem of interpretation is also complicated: how completely and accurately should the results correspond with our expectations, as represented in the tentative semantic groupings (Table 1)?",
        "Our approach is to deal in a summary manner with the noun-pairs characterized by highest Similarity Coefficients, especially with respect to their intra and intergroup relationships.",
        "Before proceeding to this discussion, a few preliminary remarks should he made about the data in the various machine listings.",
        "The summary of SRW counts for each TW, contained in Table 1, suggests all TWs do not have the same opportunity for comparison.",
        "In the case of \"correspondence\" (Group 3), Harper 12 a total of only three SRW is noted in (Column 14); as a result, this TW should be eliminated from further consideration.",
        "In addition, unless at least two, and preferably all three, types of SRW are well represented for a given TW, the SC for that noun will tend to be skewed.",
        "As examples, we note all nouns in Group 6 (for which the L3 column predominates), and the nouns in Group 10 (for which the L2 column predominates).",
        "In effect, these nouns are \"deficient\" in certain types of SRW, and require special handling.",
        "* On the printout, \"Ranking of TW-Pairs by SC,\" a number of noun pairs appear at the top end of the scale although the total number of shared SRW is small (i.e., the value of column \"NA\" (see Table 4) is \"1,\" \"2,\" or \"3.\"",
        "The SC may be high, because the product of the frequencies is relatively low.",
        "Our policy has been to discount these pairs on the grounds that the value of \"NA\" is significant in determining the similarity between two TWs.",
        "The minimum value for NA was arbitrarily set at four.",
        "Keeping in mind these amendations to the data in mind, We proceed to the discussion of the noun-pairs characterized by highest SC.",
        "Table 3 shows the distribution of SL by noun-pairs.",
        "By any standard, the data shows negative or extremely weak similarity for most of the 780 pairs.",
        "An abstract of a paper on the proclivity of nouns to enter into certain combinations is cited in Reference 3. harper 13 At which point on the curve shall we draw a line, saying that an SC above this value indicates similarity, and that an SC below this value indicates dissimilarity or weak similarity (all this of course in terms of reliability)?",
        "For purposes of discussion, we propose to set the threshold at .00100--a rigorously high figure.",
        "After eliminating pairs whose NA value is less than 4, we find 38 pairs whose SC lies in the range .00100 to .00337 (Table 5).",
        "(The first two zeroes are dropped.)",
        "The reader may draw his own conclusions about the degree of similarity between the nouns in any given pairing.",
        "For purposes of discussion, we will refer to the pairings in terms of our preliminary groupings (Table 1).",
        "The following intra and inter-Group pairings are observed",
        "We note that no pairings appear for nouns of Groups 3 and 8.",
        "All other groups except Group 4 are represented by intra-group pairings; to this degree, our expectations are fulfilled, i.e., the data supports our a priori feelings for the similarity between words.",
        "The amount of inter",
        "group pairing may indicate either that the data is inconclusive, or that our original groupings were too narrow.",
        "In fact, two larger groups emerge: one composed of Groups 1 and 2 (perhaps including Group 10), the other composed of Groups 4, 5, 6, and 7.",
        "This tendency is more marked if we lower the SC threshold from .00100 to .00070, thereby adding a total of 28 pairs to the number listed in Table S. For example, nouns of Group 1 are found to pair with those of Group 10, and nouns of Group 4 pair with those of Groups 6 and 7.",
        "The data is not statistically conclusive, but strongly suggests the emergence of the two major groups mentioned above.",
        "The amalgamation of Groups 1 and 2 can easily be defended on semantic grounds; since Group 10, as noted above, is subject to aberrant behavior (because of the very high number of noun dependents), its interrelation with Groups 1 and 2 may not be taken seriously.",
        "* Groups 4, 5, 6, and 7, which include the names of chemical mixtures, classes of elements, individual elements, and components of elements, may be taken together semantically as a single subclass of \"object nouns.\"",
        "The physicist tends to say the same things about all nouns in this group.",
        "One of the 38 pairs listed in Table 5 appears to contradict expectation: \"liquid\"/\"problem\"(Groups S and 11).",
        "It should also be noted that the noun dependents of Group 10 nouns serve a \"subjective\" rather than \"objective\" function.",
        "If we had distinguished between the syntactic function of the noun dependent, TWs of Group 10 would be only weakly similar to TWs of Groups 1 and 2.",
        "Harper 16 The four SRW shared by these two nouns include the adjective \"certain\" and the noun governor \"number.\"",
        "The non-discriminatory (\"promiscuous\") nature of these two SRW is perhaps obvious, and one of the refinements that should he introduced in future studies is the neglect of such words as \"significant\" SRW.",
        "(The study of \"promiscuity\" in adjectives is referred to in Reference 4.)",
        "At the present, experience suggests that distortions introduced by such words are minimal if the number of.",
        "SRW is sufficiently large.",
        "Our general conclusion is that, with a few anomalies, the 66 pairings for which the SC is .00700 or higher meet with our expectations.",
        "Another aspect of the question remains: many nouns with presumed similarity are not represented on the high end of the SC distribution curve.",
        "(If we lower the threshold to include such pairs we shall also encounter many non-similar pairs.)",
        "One way of dealing with this problem is to consider the most highly correlated pairs that nouns in each Group form, whether or not the SC is \"significantly\" high.",
        "In lieu of presenting this information in full detail, we show in Table 6 the most closely correlated pairs for a representative noun from each of the Groups (excepting Groups 3, 4, and 8).",
        "The most striking aspect of Table 6 is the repetition of intra and inter-Group pairings noted in Table 5 for high-SC pairings.",
        "In other words, the relative value of",
        "Harper 18 the SC appears to be as significant as the absolute value.",
        "This result was certainly not expected, and perhaps indicates a greater sensitivity in our measurement procedures than we would have thought reasonable.",
        "Table 6 suggests, but does not prove, the existence of clusters (or \"clumps\") of TWs, in which the members are closely correlated with each other, and in which no member is closely correlated to any outside word.",
        "We have not yet attempted to apply clumping procedures; a better understanding of the data is perhaps a prerequisite to this rigorous treatment.",
        "For the present, we shall point out a phenomenon that strongly suggests the existence of clumps: the recurrence of the same SRW among several TWs with high mutual correlation.",
        "Consider, for example, that a high SC is found between Test Words A and 13, 11 and C, and A and C; if, in addition, a relatively high proportion of SRW are shared by all three TWs, the mutual connection of the three words would appear to be considerably strengthened.",
        "The recurrence of SRW has not been systematically studied, but the following sample is offered as an illustration of the phenomenon.",
        "Below, we list all the SRW of the three types, for the TW calculationl.",
