        "Numerous systems for the automatic recognition procedures of context-free languages have been proposed:1 among them, two systems are in operation with comparatively large English grammars.",
        "One is J. Robinson's English parser based on J. Cocke's algorithm,3 and the other is the Kuno-Oettinger predictive analyzer of English.4'5 6 The proponents of neither of the two systems have been satisfied with simply assigning phrase-structure descriptions to each given sentence.",
        "A paraphrasing routine has booc, ,lbd to Robinson's English parser7 so that a set of kernel sentences can be obtained in addition to the phrase structure description of the sentence.",
        "For example, the analysis outputs of \"X commands the third fleet.\", \"The third fleet is commanded by X.\", and \"X is commander of the third fleet.\" would all contain the information that the kernel is \"SX, V -- commands, 0 -- third fleet\".",
        "In connection with the Kuno-Oettinger predictive analyzer, three kernelizing routines have been proposed by J. Olney,8 B. Carmody and P. Jones,9 and D. Foster,10 which accept as input the output of the predictive analyzer and produce either kernel sentences or pairs of words which are in certain defined syntactic relationships.",
        "The SMART information retrieval system,11,12,13444f Salton's Magic Automatic Retriever of Texts, has a routine which compares the structure diagram (part of the analysis output of the predictive analyzer) of a request sentence with the structure diagrams of sentences to be retrieved, so that paraphrases of the same kernel sentence can be identified.",
        "The aim of the present paper is to investigate the role of the predictive analyzer in a transformational grammar recognition system, and to propose a system for analysis of a language of a given transformational grammar.",
        "Before going into details of the proposed system, it is worthwhile to discuss briefly two other systems so far proposed as transformational grammar recognizers.",
        "2.",
        "General Solution to Recognition Problems of Transformational Languages (i) Analysis by Synthesis D. E. Walker and J. M. Bartlett16 have proposed a system which parses the language of a given transformational grammar.",
        "Their system is essentially based on Matthews' proposal17 for analysis by synthesis.",
        "Analysis of a sentence is performed by generation of all possible strings from the initial symbol \"Sentence\" by means of a phrase-structure component, a transformational component, and a phonological component.",
        "Each of the terminal strings thus generated is matched against the input sentence.",
        "When a match is found, the path which has led to the matched terminal string represents an analysis of the input sentence.",
        "Certain heuristics are used to distinguish transformations which could have been applied to generate the sentence under analysis from those which could not have.",
        "For example, if a sentence ends in a question mark, then it is certain that at some point the question transformation was used.",
        "The Walker-Bartlett system, although drastically improved in efficiency compared to the prototype proposed by Matthews, seems to be still far from being practicable because of an astronomical number of sentences that will have to be generated before the match is found.",
        "(ii) From Derived P-markers to Base P-markers Two similar parsing methods have been independently proposed by S. Petrick18 and the MITRE Language Processing Techniques Subdepartment (Zwick, A. M., Hall, B. C., Fraser, J.",
        "B., Geis, M. L., Isard, S. Mintz, J., and Peters, P. S.) directed by Walker as a general solution for the recognition problem of the language generated by a given transformational grammar.",
        "A transformational generative grammar GT has three components: the phrase-structure component, the transformational component, and the phonological component (see Diagram 1).",
        "The output of the phrase structure component are generalized P-markers which have grammatical and lexical forms emanating from the lowest nodes in the trees.",
        "The function of the transformational rules is to map generalized P--ckers into derived P-markers.",
        "If the transformational rules map the generalized P-marker MG into the final derived P-marker MD of the sentence X, then MG is the deep structure (base P-marker) of X and MD is its surface structure.",
        "The MD is then transferred to the phonological component, whose output is the plain terminal string X.20 A slightly outdated model of a transformational grammar is presented here for the purpose of avoiding delicate arguments not directly connected with the aim of the present paper.",
        "Consider the (probably infinite) set of derived P-markers obtainable from a given transformational grammar GT.",
        "Each P-marker has at the bottom a string of symbols from which no branch emanates.",
        "Regard the sot of all such strings corresponding to all derived P-markers as constituting language LD.",
        "It has been shown by Hall* that, given the original transformational grammar GT2 one can automatically construct a context-free grammar G which accepts all the strings in 110 and assigns the corresponding derived P-markers to them.",
        "It is generally the case, however, that Gs accepts nonsentences in Lb as well as sentences in LD, and also assigns some incorrect P-markers, as well as the correct one(s), to sentences in LD.",
        "The analysis procedure works as follows (see Diagram 2).",
        "*** Given a sentence in L(GT)' the dictionary lookup program, which essentially plays the role of the inverse of a phonologicalcomponent, converts the sentence into a string in LD.",
        "A context-free analyzer with grammar Gs assigns one (or more if the string is ambiguous in Gs) derived P-marker(s) to the string.",
        "Then, each such P-marker is transferred to the inverse transformational component of GT.",
        "A test is made to see which of the transformational rules could have been applied to map some previous P-marker into the current Private communication.",
        "The author is greatly indebted to Barbara C. Hall, who read a preliminary draft of this paper and gave him numerous valuable suggestions.",
        "** Actually, the context-free grammars for derived P-markers in both Petrick's and the MITRE group's systems have been manually compiled.",
        "Hall's automatic procedure does not guarantee an optimal context-free grammar for derived P-markers of a given transformational grammar.",
        "*** The analysis procedure described here is that of the MITRE group, with some simplifications for the sake of clarity of explanation.",
        "Patrick's procedure is conceptually similar to, but actually deviates significantly from, the model described here.",
        "Then, the analytical context-free grammar for derived P-markers will have a rule which identifies a noun phrase consisting of an article (art), an adjective (adj), and a noun.",
        "To this rule, we can assign the information that the base P-marker image of this noun phrase is the subtree corresponding to art the noun be adj # noun\" of Fig. 1.",
        "We can say that each such rule in the analytical context-free grammar draws a subtree of some base P-marker.",
        "When a derived P-marker of a sentence is obtained, the set of phrase structure rules used for the analysis draws a set of subtrees which, when combined together, constitute the base P-marker corresponding to the derived P-marker.",
        "The system is designed with the predictive analyzer4'5 as its core.",

        "The M-P system is based on the condition that a transformational grammar is given.",
        "A context-free analysis component is automatically constructed* on the basis of the transformational grammar; the context-free analysis component assigns one or more derived P-markers to a sentence to be analyzed; transformational rules are applied inversely to each P-marker step by step until the base P-markers of the sentence are obtained.",
        "For example, after a derived P-marker is assigned to \"He met a beautiful girl.\", the M-P system will compare the P-marker with the derived See the second footnote on page 4",
        "constituent structure indices of transformational rules, and find that this derived P-marker is the result of the transformational rule which places an adjective in front of a noun.",
        "Therefore, by applying this rule inversely, an intermediate P-marker corresponding to \"#He met a girl beautifule is obtained.",
        "Next, this new P-marker is compared with derived constituent structure of transformational rules, and it is found that this is the result of the transformational rule which deletes a relative pronoun and a copula.",
        "Therefore, by applying this rule inversely, an intermediate P-marker corresponding to \"#He met a girl who was beautiful' is obtained.",
        "Next, this intermediate P-marker is compared with the derived constituent structure indices of transformational rules again and is identified as being the result of a relativization rule.",
        "Therefore, the rule is applied inversely, and a new P-marker corresponding to \"#He met a girl # the girl was beautifule is obtained, which in turn is identified as originating from a rule which places an embedded #4 dominated by DET after the noun.",
        "A new P-marker corresponding to \"#He met a # the girl was beautiful #girle is thus obtained.",
        "After comparing this P-marker again with rules in the transformational component, it is found that there is no rule whose derived constituent structure index matches the P-marker.",
        "It is also found that the P-marker is derivable from the phrase-structure component of the transformational grammar.",
        "Thus, the P-marker is identified as being a base P-marker, and forward application of the transformations which were inversely applied confirms that it is in fact the base P-marker of the sentence under analysis.",
        "With regard to the K system, on the other hand, a predictive grammar which accepts all the sentences of a given transformational grammar GT (and probably nonsentences in addition) is manually compiled.",

        "For example, the fact that the predictive rule NP, art> A N has been used for assigning a distorted P-marker to the sentence \"He met a beautiful girl.\" indicates immediately that an embedded sentence which constitutes a relative clause is involved here, that the subject of the embedded sentence is the same as a noun (\"girl\" in our example) which fulfills N of the predictive rule, and that the adjective (\"beautiful\") which fulfills A is the predicate adjective of the embedded sentence.",
        "The predictive rule has associated with it a set of ordered pairs which draws a subtree of the base P-marker image of this NP.",
        "The summation of such subtrees drawn by all the rules used for obtaining the distorted P-maker yields the base P-maker of the sentence.",
        "The K system does not achieve this one-step mapping without cost.",

        "(i) Look at the girl who is dancing the mazurka.",
        "(ii) This is the girl whom everyone likes.",
        "(iii) This is the girl by whom he was ruined.",
        "the predictive grammar must have three different rules pertaining to a noun phrase initiated by the definite article \"the.\" Each rule specifies a different position, in the embedded sentence, of the predicted N (see circled N's in Fig. 11).",
        "Moreover, in order to deal with sentences such as",
        "(iv) Look at the .giring the mazurka.",
        "(v) Look at the dancing girl.",
        "(vi) This is the girl liked by sverybody.",
        "additional rules have to be recognized which have the same argument pair <NP, the> but which have different sequences of new predictions and the different sets of ordered pairs from those in Rules (i), (ii) and (iii).",
        "Depending upon the nature of the original transformational grammar GT, the number of such rules with the same argument pair can become very large.",
        "However, when a given sentence with a noun phrase is analyzed, only one of these rules will lead to the end of the sentence (unless the sentence is ambiguous with respect to the noun phrase), and all the other rules of <NP, the>",
        "will come to an impasse before the end of the noun phrase is reached.",
        "Moreover, once an analysis of the sentence is obtained, the derived P-marker can be unambigu2usly mapped into the corresponding base P-marker."

        "\"z\" as the second coordinate of an ordered pair means that when the ordered pair is stored in the work area (not in the PDS), z should be changed into whatever word form has fulfilled the prediction.",
        "For example, the second word \"young\" of the sentence is processed with Rule 2', which has two ordered pairs (x2, be) and (x3, z) associated with the argument pair's prediction NP'.",
        "NP' in the PDS has (1, z) due to Rule 1.",
        "Therefore, max x = 1, and z = young.",

        "Therefore, ((x+1)-2, be) = ((2+1)'2, be) = (32, be) is obtained, which is stored in the output word area as well as (2, made) obtained from (2, z).",
        "In the same way, the two sets of ordered pairs for the two new predictions of Rule 4' will be changed into:",

        "Max x is equal to 31.",
        "Therefore, (x2, be) and (x3, z) are changed to (312, be) and (313, beautiful), respectively, which are then stored in the output work area.",
        "The new prediction N is assigned (3, z), (31, z), and (311, z) due to the set of ordered pairs [(x, and (xl, z) of the prediction.",
        "The reason that max x is to be used among all the values of x in [(x, y)1 is that, whatever the branch number of the noun (\"girl\") which fulfills N may be, we want to have the word triple corresponding to N (\"girl\") - be - adj (\"beautiful\") emanate as the lowest-order subtree dependent upon the lowest-order occurrence of N (\"girl\").",
        "Otherwise, the branch numbers of N (\"girl\"), be, adj (\"beautiful\") would be confused with branch numbers of N (\"girl\"), be, N (\"wife\") (see Fig. 12).",

        "This places the NP (which is eventually fulfilled by \"girl\") on the same level in a tree as the prediction VP which has been fulfilled by \"made.\" When P-markers of the type shown in Fig. 12 are desired, neither the addition operation nor the concatenation operation is satisfactory in dealing with sentences with coordinate structures, for which a new device has to be introduced.",
