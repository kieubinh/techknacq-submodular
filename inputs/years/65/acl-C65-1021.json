        "Sakai 1 Abstract.",
        "The purpose of this paper is to help linguists contruct a consistent, sufficient and less redundant syntax of language.",
        "An acceptable string corresponds to an expression or an utterance: it may be a natural text, a string of morphemes, a tree structure or any kind of representation.",
        "A sharp distinction is made between the syntactic function which is an attritute – af_atrings and the distribution class which is a set of strings.",
        "Syntactic function of a continuous or discontinuous string is defined as the set of all the acceptable contexts of the string, and is called a complete neighborhood.",
        "Two contexts are equivalent if they accept or reject any given string at the same time.",
        "An elementary neighborhood is the set of all contexts equivalent to one context.",
        "Four simple distribution classes are proposed and their properties are discussed.",
        "Concatenation rules of a language can be described in terms of concatenated complete neighborhoods or concatenated distribution classes.",
        "Some possible representations and their consequences are discussed.",
        "Transformational rules are also described in a similar way.",
        "However, there is another problem of correspondence of original strings to their transforms.",
        "It is useful to establish subsets of elementary neighborhoods and this subclassification may contribute to a simplification of the clumsy representation of derivational history.",
        "Finally, some trivial but practically useful conventions are described.",
        "1.",
        "Introduction.",
        "The grammar of a language should be consistent throughout its whole system.",
        "No features should be left unformulated in order that the grammar be a complete one.",
        "At the same time, it is desirable to prepare the grammar as compact as possible.",
        "These are important requirements especially when the grammar is a machine-oriented one.",
        "The knowledge on the formal properties of syntax will help us construct an objective system of grammar.",
        "Every term used in a description should be rigorously defined and no ambiguous expressions are allowed.",
        "If the consequence of grammar rules deviates from the proper usage of the language, we will be able to trace back the definitions and locate the source of trouble.",
        "When the grammar rules are given in terms of concatenated symbols, we must know the formal definition of the symbols before writing a program by which the rules are applied to the text.",
        "If a grammar rule describes the nature of a P-marker, the label given to each node in the P-marker must have an unambiguous definition which relates the meaning of the symbol to the strings supplied as texts.",
        "Sakai 2 We need, at least, an objective criterion by which we can specify a language.",
        "This criterion will be a dichotomous decision whether or not a given symbol string belongs to the language.in question.",
        "We leave the decision to native speakers and consider the acceptable strings undefined.",
        "A substring of an acceptable string is said to have a syntactic function or a part of speech.",
        "The syntactic function of a symbol string is considered as the set of all acceptable utterances in which the string occurs.",
        "We eliminate the string in question and define its syntactic function as the set of all acceptable contexts of the string.",
        "The set of all acceptable contexts of a string is called a complete neighborhood.",
        "A distribution class can be defined as a set of strings whose complete neighborhoods are related to a given set of contexts in a specified way.",
        "We propose four simple definitions of distribution classes.",
        "With these fundamental concepts of parts of speech and distribution classes, we can proceed to a more formal system of syntactic description.",
        "However, a few questions may be immediately raised.",
        "Is it really possible to construct a grammar in such an elementary way?",
        "How can we list the elements of a set picking them up out of a practically infinite number of strings even though each string is assumed to be of finite length?",
        "Is it not useless to establish such sets for a natural language, most of which are likely to have only one element?",
        "Etc.",
        "Etc.",
        "We should be better off if we were to create a new language by preparing a grammar and a lexicon.",
        "Unfortunately the situation is quite contrary when we are to handle a natural language.",
        "The language exists.",
        "We want to find out a grammar that accounts for all and only the acceptable strings of the language.",
        "We regard a language L as a set of strings generated by a machine M, whose internal structure is not known to us.",
        "We can observe only a part of the set of generated strings in a limited length of time.",
        "We want to construct a hypothetical machanism M' that generates all and only the strings in L. The internal structure of M and M' may not be the same.",
        "The output of M' is checked if it is an element of L, and strings are supplied to M' to see if M' accepts a string if and only if it is an element of L. To do this, we must have the set L, or a mechanism which tells us whether or not the given string belongs to L. We call this mechanism a normative device.",
        "It is a native speaker if a natural language is to be discussed.",
        "We simplify the situation by assuming a few separate strata in the mechanism.",
        "A string generated is supposed to have been transferred from a stratum to another before it becomes a string of natural language.",
        "An utterance has a few different forms corres-Sakai 3 pending to the strata.",
        "Each form has its own grammar.",
        "The normative device will be a linguist in this case.",
        "Since the number of strings is practically infinite, a linguist trying to constuct a grammar will find it advantageous to establish rules that hold for a set of strings or for a set of relevant facts.",
        "A linguistic phenomenon may be analyzed from various points of view which will help him avoid listing a tremendous number of phenomena and rules.",
        "He will attach certain markers to the strings-according to the way he considers consistent with his usage of language.",
        "He will then write down the rules in terms of the markers.",
        "He may also establish his rules in terms of sets of strings which share some common features in their markers.",
        "The procedure of using these rules consists of two parts.",
        "The one is a routine that compares a rule with the text and decides whether or not the rule is to be applied.",
        "The other is a transfer routine by which the relevant information is read out of the applicable rules and transferred to the text.",
        "In these procedures, both comparison and transfer are carried out with the coded markers.",
        "It is important that the meaning of the codes is unambiguously defined so that the code obtained in the text is exactly what the linguist wants to mean.",
        "Some of his rules may account for a certain number of texts he has examined but may fail to account for some others or to rule out similar but inconsistent facts.",
        "He will test his rules by applying them to a natural text or by generating strings.",
        "The normative device will tell him whether or not a string supplied to it is acceptable but not tell him why.",
        "It is obvious that these procedures can not be carried out practically on every string that may be supplied to a machine in the future, and that nobody will be able to predict what can occur when an arbitrary string is supplied to the machine.",
        "Nevertheless, it is required that a grammar may deal with most of the texts supplied in the future.",
        "His grammar is inevitably affected by the nature of the normative device.",
        "If the normative device is so strict as to reject every string which fails to meet such requirements as that its style must be just an ordinary one, the statement must be logically correct, the lexical usage must conform with the regular way of the language, etc., etc., then the linguist must prepare a separate rule for almost every string.",
        "He can break down the decision procedure into a few separate steps.",
        "The first device will accept a string if it finds the internal relationship of the string is acceptable, regardless of the reality the string designates.",
        "If the grammar is to be applied to input texts Sakai 4 whose structure is always grammatically correct and unambiguous, a grammar which satisfies the requirement of this device will be enough.",
        "However, it will give many unusual strings if it is used in tandem generation and many ambiguous alternatives if it is used for analysis.. c, second device may reject those strings whose structure shows an unallowable combination of lexical elements, thus eliminating some of the ambiguous alternatives in analysis and suppressing the output with improper usage of lexical elements in synthesis.",
        "The third device may reject as unacceptable those strings which are not logically consistent.",
        "If one wants to have more rigorous grammar that may be used for random generation of only non-surprising sentences, he may add more devices to the preceding ones, so that the grammar may be tested from such points of view.",
        "He will prepare his grammar keeping the characteristics of his normative device in mind.",
        "A number of digits will be assigned to the coded form of markers corresponding to each step of decision.",
        "The procedure will be programmed so as to handle these digits independently, thus allowing a number of rules to be applied to the same string.",
        "If certain digits are related to each other, and a particular combination of codes is to obey a particular rule, the rule will be prepared independently and the general procedure will be prohibited.",
        "This is done by a simple technique in coding and programming.",
        "As we see on the following pages, a number of similar but different representaions are possible.",
        "If we are not ready to understand the exact meaning of codes and rules and to prepare the right program for the representation chosen, the rules established on the basis of ad hoc definitions will result in a chaos.",
        "The formal property is not confined to a certain language, but it is common to many, probably to all, languages.",
        "A grammar will not deviate greatly from its proper constuction if its formal property is carefully examined."
