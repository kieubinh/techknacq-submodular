        "First, the generation of kernel sentence by phrase structure rules; second, the application of transformational rules to the kernel sentence; and finally the completion of a sentence by the morphophonemic modifications.",
        "At the first stage of generating kernel sentence, the semantics of words are fully utilized.",
        "The method is such that a pair of words in the generation process (subject noun and predicate verb, verb and object or complement, adjective and modified noun etc.)",
        "is selected in accordance with the semantic categories which are attached to each word in the word dictionary.",
        "The semantic categories are determined by considering both the meaning of words themselves and also the functioning of words in sentences.",
        "At the stage of transformational rules, sentence is considered not as a simple string but as the one having the internal tree structure, and the transformational rules are applied to this tree structure.",
        "For these two stages the generation process is formalized strictly and is realized in a computer programming.",
        "We have presented in relation to the transformational rules a method of sentence generation not from the axiom (from the top of the tree) but from any point, from which the whole tree is constructed.",
        "We have also proposed that the morphophonemic rules can be presented as a kind of operators operating on words in the neighbourhood of a generated string."

        "There have been many excellent contributions to the problems of syntax, but there are still few to the problems of semantics and the interrelationship between syntax and semantics.",
        "We have tried an investigation in this area by the method of generation of English sentence.",

        "We have adopted the method once again from the following points of view.",
        "(i) it acts as a powerful test to the study of sentence structure, (ii) ?I to the study of semantics, (iii) to the study of the relationship between syntax and semantics in natural language.",
        "Generally speaking the sentence generation method, contrary to the analysis of a given sentence (which is guaranteed to be a correct one), tends to demand the severe construction of syntactic rules and word selection rules.",
        "It may seem at the present level of mechanical translation that the treatment of the sentence property in its entirety is too difficult to realize.",
        "But if we hope to have the translation as perfect as Sakai & Nagao 2 possible, we are necessarily to confront with this problem.",
        "The quality of a linguistic theory of a language may be best examined by the generation of sentences according to the specified linguistic theory.",
        "Especially the effect of the interrelationship between syntax and semantics seems to be clearly exemplified by this so to speak \"crude\" test.",
        "Thus the sentence generation method surely responds to this overall treatment of the sentence property.",
