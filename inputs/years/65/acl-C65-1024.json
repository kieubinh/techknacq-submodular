        "1.1 In the works of N. ghomsky, P.M.Postal, J.J.Katz and others there are formulated three zeneral aims of generative grammar: a) the grammar generates, all and only the grammatical sentences of the described lingua e, in the sense of a mathematical enumeration of the set of grammatical sentences; b) the grammar automatically ascribes to each generated sentence a structural.dcscription, not contradictory to the intuitive evidence of native speakers; if the same sentence is generated by the grammar in n different ways, n different structural descriptions are ascribed to it; c) the grammar is a description of the mechanism the user of the language has internalized and uses in the process of language communication (as a speaker, hearer etc.).",
        "There are, of course, other aims or conditions laid upon generative grammars, e.g. those concerning degrees of grammaticalness of sentences.",
        "But our main point here concerns the three conditions cited; we assume that these are actually three different conditions, in particular that b and c are not identicallb being implied by c, so that a grammar can exist, which satisfies the conditions a and b, but not c. 1.2 If we examine the new version of transformational LLai75,121/ descriptienXTrom that point of view, we see that there are difficulties concerning the condition c. Of course, we are now applying the conditions not only to the grammar, but to the whole description, including its semantic component.",
        "le are not certain, however, that the mutual relations of the three components of this description have been characterized-quite correctly.",
        "There is one creative component, (A)., whose output is interpreted by Sgall 3 both (B), i.e. semantics, and (C); but then - in my opinion - (A) the basis (including lexical rules), and the transformational and phonological parts belong to (C).",
        "Whether this is the case or not, the formulation of the new shape of the transformational description is a further and important step in overcoming the one – sidedness of descriptivism.",
        "An adequate basis for fulfilling the conditions a and b may be considered to have been reached in this way.",
        "But our question remains: can this system really be considered to describe the mechanism used in speech communication?",
        "J.J.Katz writes (/5/, p.4; similarly in /6/): \"The whole process may be pictured as follows: the speaker, for reasons that are biographically relevant but linguistically not, chooses a message he wants to convey to the hearer.",
        "...This message is translated into syntactic form by the selection of a syntactic structure whose semantic interpretation is this message: Of course, the question, why a particular message has been chosen, is not a linguistic one.",
        "But if the mechanism used by the speaker to translate the message into syntactic form were to be described as a device for translating, not just for selection, this other description would be preferable, as to that point.",
        "1.3 The generative description is neutral to the speaker and to the hearer, i.e. to the production and understanding of sentences.",
        "But in a sense the generation is nearer to the production, just as the recognition procedure is nearer to the understanding of sentences.",
        "That is, the sentence appears as an output string in the generative description and in the process of production, whereas in the recognition routine and in the process of understanding it appears as an input string,.",
        "N.Ctiomsky introduced the distinction of the compei-ence and the performance of language users;, the methodological importance of Sgall 4 this distinction is undeniable.",
        "But it is not evident whether the generative grammar is the same as the description of the competence of both speaker and hearer; it is not clear whether a recognition grammar belongs to the realm of performance (cf. Hays /47p.8/), or to the realm of competence, also (cf. categorical and other grammars, formulated as recognition grammars, e.g. /1/, but not intended as models of the hearer's activity).",
        "One sees, of course, that the actual programs for random.",
        "generation of sentences /17,9/ are not models of the speaker's activity, either.",
        "But that is not due, perhaps, to their being related to generative grammars.",
        "So our questions are: Has a description of the user s competence to be neutral with regard to the speaker and the hearer?",
        "(Or, better: Are all the differences between the speaker's and the hearer's activity due only to their performance, are there no differences which should be respected in a description of their co4petence, of the mechanism they have internalized?)",
        "And, further: If the generative description is neutral in this respect, is the recognition description also neutral?",
        "- If we assume that the set of grammatical sentences is a recursive one, then why should we prefer generation as the form of the description of language, and not recognition?",
        "2.1.",
        "The mechanism internalized by the user of a language enables him (I) to choose a message as such, (II) to formulate this message, i.e. to translate it from its \"semantic\" form to one of the corresponding phonetic forms, (III) to \"interpret\" or understand a sentence, i.e. to translate it f2om its phonetic form to any of the corresponding \"semantic\" forms, (IV) to choose the most appropriate form, while translating in either directions The parts (I) and (IV) cannot be fully described by linguistic Stall 5 means alone.",
        "As to parts (II) and (III), we see that they are essentially translating procedures.",
        "They may include some blocking or checking sub parts, but we should try to describe at least their main parts as trwisducers or in some similar way (or, alternatively, to show that this is impossible).",
        "The vast and heterogeneous field presystematically called semantics should be analyzed from such a point of view;, there are elements in it which belong to the \"transductive\" part of the mechanism and are purely linguistic; the relations between levels or strata of the language system can be described as \"semantic\" relations (relations of \"representation\", with the so-called \"assymetrical dualism\", i.e. generally many - to - many relations /4,14/).",
        "On the other hand, there are other\" quite distinct, \"semantic\" problems, concerning the manner of choice of a message itself, and of these only some are intrinsically linguistic (e.g. questions concerning anal contradiction).",
        "2.2 Even if the mechanism briefly outlined above could be integrally described, it would be a description of the competence, not of the performance of a user of language.",
        "It would not describe, particularly, the relations connected with restrictions of memory and other faculties of individual speakers, nor various possible short-cuts used during the process of speech.",
        "It would hardly be possible to describe, by linguistic means, the conditions under",
        "which a construction is being built upYthe speaker during the act of speech, and the conditions under which it is delivered as a whole by the memory; only extreme eases, where there is only the latter= possibility, are distinguished explicitly by the grammar; the dormer constructions are, e.g. \"analytical\" forms of newly coined or accepted words formed \"by analogy\"; at the other extreme are idioms, \"irregular\" forms and other \"exceptions\", which have to be listed"

        "tide can say, then, that the distinction between competence and performance is independent from that between speaker and hearer.",
        "If the description contains some part(s) used only by the speaker, and others used only by the hearer, it does not follow that it is no longer a description only of their competence.",
        "2.3.",

        "But it is not Blear whether the transformational description really can serve as such an enumeration.",
        "If so (e.g. if the X semantic component does not, as a filter, block an infinite number of sentoids), then it would be possible to reverse the semantic component in some way (to discover its inverse machine), and use this inverted procedure as the description of the mechanism the speaker uses while translating the message to its syntactic form.",
        "If there is no such possibility, then the semantic component in its present form is not satisfactory, either.",

        "),' Of course, we have to distinguish here between cases where translation proceeds only as an operation on texts, without using other than linguistics knowledge and knowledge obtained from the translated text itself, and cases, where the translator has to obtain from external sources information not contained in the text but reciaired by the grammar of the output language (in cases as \"king John's son\" translated to GerLan \"ern Sohn des Unigs J.\"",

        "As to strong generative power, the system has to ascribe not only taxonomical structural descriptions, i.e. there must be a possibility of having Sgall 8 structural descriptions not just for sentences, but for several levels of sentence structure, such as the deep structure and the surface structure.",

        "As to the second condition, concerning strong generative power, our system, as a stratificational one, shares the main property of transformational description and cannot be held to be taxonomic.",
        "There ore three levels or strata (not to speak of phonology and phonetics; but the question of the namber of strata is an empirical one and it is possible that typologically different languages do not coincide in this respect; we are working with inflected languages, such as Czech or :ussian): the tectogrammatical or \"semantic\" level CL), the phenogramiaatical level (surface structure, 0 9 Li), and the morpholo_ical level (L2).",
        "The sequence of representations of a sentence on each of these levels, a member of LoX L1 X L2 fllfilling the condition that each of its elenerits is derivable by the transducer system (from its predecessor in the sequence, if there is any), is a structural description of that sentence.",

        "So, not a unique description of the sAactic structure is ascribed to a sentence (with no homonymy) but, rather, two distinct descriptions (elements of L0 and L1, respectively), whose mutual relation can be compared with that of Chomsky's deep structure and surface structure.",
