        "In order to test how far this aim has been fulfilled and further, to provide evidence to guide a potential agency interested in giving a machine translation service, we have carried out an evaluation experiment on our translations, the conditions of which as far as possible emulated those of a translations service.",

        "We have been concerned with the translation of scientific Russian texts only.",
        "In considering how we might evaluate the results of our work, the context of use of scientific translations imposed two main constraints.",
        "Thus, firstly, in the vast majority of oases we would expect readers of translations to be themselves experts in the subject matter of the material translated., i.e. they would be reading the translations because these reflect their main professional responsibilities.",
        "We may then expect that the inherent background knowledge of such readers will ensure a high impetus to their comprehension of translations and help them through syntactic awkwardnesses and multiple-meaning choices.",
        "We would also expeot that only a small percentage of these readers would have any competence in Russian.",
        "Secondly, the items of translation being read by the above typical readers will normally be whole information units (journal article, chapter of book, abstract, review, &c.), and they will have the freedom to ignore unimportant sections of such units and to use sentence or paragraph context (or even remoter references) to help elucidate obscure sections.",
        "More specifically, a particular sentence may be poorly translated, but because the reader can see that this is not an important sentence or because the context of (hopefully, better-translated) neighbouring sentences clarifies its meaning, that sentence may not affect at all an adequate comprehension of the whole.",
        "Both these constraints are reflected in our evaluation experiment.",
        "We ensured that our evaluators were expert in the - 1 - field of the material they were evaluating, and also that they commented on the adequacy of an information unit as a whole, not on individual sentences.",
        "We have included in this paper (FIG.",
        "2(A)) a short passage from one of the evaluated translations, as the full translation is inappropriate for this printed version.",
        "However, the full translation will be available for inspection at the presentation of the paper, or the full translation of another paper can be examined in reference 1, The evaluation experiment In order to fulfil the first constraint above, we invited practising scientists to send in Russian papers, reflecting their professional speciality and preferably in the fields of general physics, electronics, or eleotrical engineering, Some papers resulted from direct invitation, others resulted from an open invitation published in our house journal, \".NPL Quarterly\".",
        "We undertook to send them the machine translations of their papers in return for their comments on how useful the results were.",
        "We also obtained second opinions from other specialists in the subjects concerned.",
        "These evaluators were therefore as far as possible typioal of the \"customers\" of a production MT service; in particular they had a personal interest in the subject matter and usually little if any knowledge of Russian.",
        "In all 44 papers were received in response to our invitation; of these 28 were translated in fulll.",
        "Seven of these were disregarded for various reasons2, and the remaining 21 were included in the evaluation.",
        "38 comments were received on 19 of these 21 papers.",
        "Of these two were rejected for vagueness, and three brief comments from one group were treated as one, so in all the experiment produced 34 comments on 19 papers.",
        "1 The other 16 are accounted for as follows: 1 was on a remote subject; 2 were deferred since we had already translated three papers for the same 'customer'; 4. were withdrawn; 3 were translated only in part; and 6 were not reached by the date our computer was scrapped.",
        "23 were on inappropriate subjects; 2 were translated only by an earlier version of the programs; and 2 were translated too late for inclusion, - 2 - We had decided to give our evaluators a free hand in discussing the usefulness to them of translations of this quality.",
        "This meant that a scale had to be devised by which their comments could then be graded by us.",
        "A scale recently published in the U.S.A. (reference 2) was considered but not adopted since we felt that for our purposes more space should be given to the middle range of the scale.",
        "The following wording was adopted:",
        "8 Fully adequate.",
        "Meaning immediately clear, even though not always conventionally expressed.",
        "7 6 Mostly very good.",
        "A few sentences obscure, so that something essential may be lost, but normally clear enough.",
        "5 4 Fair.",
        "Takes a good deal of time to extract meaning and even then there is no great confidence in it, resulting in a partial understanding.",

        "The wording of this scale is not derived on any scientific basis, but it has proved useful in practice, since when four of us came to grade the comments by it independently, there was a good agreement between our markings.",
        "Our four individual ratings for each comment were reduced to a single rating (normally the mean) after discussion.",
        "The range of scores is shown in FIG.",
        "1; the mean score is 5.6.",
        "The spread is no doubt due to a real variation in the quality of the translations combined with the prejudices and degrees of patienoe of the evaluators.",
        "The lowest scores thus come from impatient professional translators dealing with a poorer-than-average text, while the highest ones are perhaps overenthusiastic supporters dealing with a better-than-average text.",
        "The consensus though, is that there is a real demand for translations of this quality, and this result provides, we feel, ample justification for mounting a broader evaluation exercise, over a wider range of potential readers of such translations, to strengthen, if possible, this verdict and make it possible to",
        "decide on the viability of a produotion machine translation service based on our system.",
        "Evaluators' oritioisms Apart from the opinions as to the general usefulness of translation, evaluators' nomments contained many particular points of criticism which deserve discussion.",
        "We are able to comment ourselves on some of these points from the position of having done considerable development work, just short of full implementation, on techniques designed to overcome the particular translation faults.",
        "Full details of this further work are given in reference 1, and speoifio points of reference are given below.",
        "Most of these criticisms can be classified into three groups, concerning respectively: (i) the English equivalents offered, (ii) the syntactic resolution and (iii) the word order.",
        "A frequent criticism concerned missing or inappropriate equivalents.",
        "In addition to fully justified remarks of this kind there were also cases in which the meaning proposed, or preferred by the reader, was uncommon.",
        "Its absence from the dictionary was the result of a preferential choice having been made, a compromise between completeness and simplicity.",
        "The other alternative, including all possible equivalents, would of course drastically impair readability.",
        "The particular solution is often very difficult and can only be achieved to a satisfactory degree after long experience.",
        "In other oases there is no obvious preference and the problem is further aggravated by the very high frequency of occurrence of the word.",
        "Here belong some special classes, for example all prepositions and some very common words such as m , a , and RTO Prepositions can and should be resolved by considering them together with either the governing word or the governed complement (nominal or otherwise)1.",
        "(For example, ysemrzuvrL.. Ha.., 'to increase by ....1).",
        "For the awkward common words specific syntactic subroutines should be devised.",
        "In practically all cases the solution is unique (see reference 1).",
        "Only two evaluators complained about the necessity of selection among two or three equivalents.",
        "This is a matter of preference, but it seems to us that for a bona fide reader an additional possibility of meaning (if it is not carried too far) is more an asset than a disadvantage, even if it impairs to some ---------- ■■••■ •••••• =1.11.••••■ 1On the lines already used for the recognition of idioms, expanded to include non-adjacent words; see below in the summary of methods.",
        "extent smooth reading1 Until a semantic analysis can be achieved, multiple equivalents are bound to stay in MT.",
        "A minor point, but nevertheless worth attention, was to the effect that when multiple equivalents followed each other, the difficulty in understanding increased out of proportion.",
        "For example, czrzaeTcs np appears as: 'occurs in ' when the results with actual meaning is often 'results in'.",
        "This was undoubtedly a real problem, which could perhaps be helped by using a longer space between sets of multiple equivalents in the output.",
        "Complaints concerning unidiomatic translations (e.g. 'period of work' instead of 'life-time') would be allayed by more work spent on our idiom list, which contained only about 54.0 items, whereas 1,500 would be a more realistic figure.",
        "Complaints about inadequate syntactic analysis, leading to obscurities, ambiguities, and wrong resolutions, would have been considerably reduced by a full implementation of the syntactic routines described in reference 1.",
        "One of the minor but annoying ambiguities, which had been resolved theoretically, but only partially implemented, was that of adverb/short adjective.",
        "Order of clause components was a frequent subject of criticism; of course they can be rearranged according to the English usage only after a complete analysis has been made.",
        "Among other things criticized was an inadequate treatment of abbreviations and abbreviated units, some of which were covered by dictionary entries, while others were not, and this led to some misunderstandings.",
        "Obviously this again is a matter for a more complete dictionary2.",
        "The most difficult case is \"nonce\" abbreviations (we met, for instance, seRTp.",
        "for setiPpossER and produced 'non-itr.",
        "', which helped no one;) Here we see no prospect of a solution.",
        "Our \"anglicizing\" routine was criticized (while appreciating the general idea) for unorthodox transliteration, which made it more difficult to identify the word in a standard dictionary, if neoessary3.",
        "A partial solution may be to exclude certain word 'Much can be said on this point.",
        "Readers, no doubt, will realise how a velvet smoothness of translation may hide many a grievous fault.",

        "classes, e.g. acronymic abbreviations, which are obviously not suitable objects for the routine (they can be automatically recognized as clusters of capital letters).",
        "Also, in our prefix-recognizing routine there is an inherent danger that a \"not-in-dictionary\" word may have a part of the stem identical with an accepted prefix.",
        "This applies in particular to short prefixes, like me-, in the above example of metPp..",
        "There is no general way of dealing with such words.",
        "The best solution, in respect of both routines, seems to be, however, to include in the output both the original (in Cyrillic, if possible) and the synthetic equivalent for all \"not-in-dictionary\" words.",
        "A few comments contained bouquets rather than brickbats.",
        "One evaluator commented that the translation became easier to read as he got used to the unusual 'style'; and another found an instance where a slip in the published human translation had reversed the intended meaning; our version of the passage,while not perfect by any means, was certainly not misleading in this way.",
        "Finally, several evaluators commented that machine translations would need to show advantages in cost and speed over human translations in order for them to be attractive as well as acceptable, and these are indeed criteria that we would ourselves put forward without fear of contradiction.",
        "We have not included a study of cost and speed within this evaluation experiment, as we do not have the market data to prepare a translation service specification that we could then refer such a study to.",
        "However it is evident that our machine equivalent of the human translator i.e. input punching, machine translation and output printing (with no human post-editor) will show a clear advantage on both these points.",
