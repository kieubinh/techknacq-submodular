        "accomplishing automatic translation from Russian into English.",
        "A bipartite system is characterized by the fact that it consists of two major portions: a machine dictionary and a translation algorithm.",
        "It differs from a tripartite system which consists of three major portions: a machine dictionary, a parsing algorithm, and a separate table of grammatical and semantic rules.",
        "In the author's opinion, the alleged advantages of a tripartite algorithm turn out to be illusory, whenever in practice the use of a realistically extensive grammar, and not just a few basic rules, is attempted.",
        "The grammar table then becomes so complex that it can no longer be handled by a simple algorithm.",
        "Then either the algorithm has to be adapted to the table, which reduces its generality, or a secondary algorithm has to be written which will show the processor the way around the table.",
        "The algorithm of a bipartite system is essentially a linguistic pattern recognition algorithm which, instead of matching portions of sentences against rules stored in a table, directs searches at the different portions of the sentence in order to identify its grammatical pattern.",
        "Thus, the essential characteristic of the algorithm is the sequencing of searches and, in each search subroutine, only as much grammatical information is used as is appropriate to the particular search.",
        "The rules of the grammar are in fact applied by the algorithm in a definite order, and a given rule is'not even called unless the previous searches have led to a point where its application becomes necessary.",
        "This means that the highly complex system of rules that makes up the real grammar of a language is distributed over a correspondingly complex algorithm which applies the rules in terms of the ordering that the structure of the language requires.",
        "The Fulcrum approach is.",
        "based on two fundamental principles: the concept of the fulcrum and the pass method.",
        "2.",
        "The concept of the fulcrum implies the use of key elements within the sentence (fulcra) as starting points for the searches performed by the algorithm.",
        "This means that the algorithm, in searching through a sentence, does not simply progress from word to word, but in fact \"skips\" from fulcrum to fulcrum.",
        "It performs a little search sequence each time it has reached a fulcrum, and goes on to the next fulcrum when this particular search is completed.",
        "3.",
        "The pass method means that not one but several passes are made at every sentence, each pass designed to identify a particular set of grammatical conditions pertinent to the recognition process.",
        "Consequently, each pass has its own set of fulcra and its own search sequences.",
        "The pass method reflects the orderly progression in which the determination of the structure of the sentence is made: first, the sentence components are identified individually, then the relations between components are established, and finally the structure of the sentence as a whole is established.",
        "To each of these intermediate parsing objectives there corresponds, roughly, a pass or series of passes in the algorithm.",
        "The correspondence is not exact, because there are many ambiguities and irregularities interfering with the recognition process, and the design of the Fulcrum algorithm reflects these added complexities.",
        "4.",
        "The Fulcrum syntactic analyzer has been implemented on two levels: (a) an earlier, less sophisticated version called Fulcrum I, which has been fully coded and is now capable of producing experimental translations; (b) a recent more•sophisticated version, called Fulcrum II, for which detailed plans have been drawn up and which, when implemented on a general-purpose computer, will be.",
        "capable of producing translations for practical use.",
        "It is expected that the complete implementation of the Fulcrum II will take four to six years.",
        "5.",
        "The major improvements in the Fulcrum II over Fulcrum I are the following:",
        "a.",
        "The order of passes and individual search operations deviates further from the order of descriptive levels than was the case in Fulcrum I.",
        "This is due to the fact that the new search patterns are based primarily on the order in which the grammatical information becomes available to the program rather than the order in which a linguist would prefer to present his description.",
        "b.",
        "The Fulcrum II uses an iterative principle.",
        "The same set of search operations is used repeatedly to establish the internal structure of a variety of syntactic units.",
        "Thus, inserted structures (such as parenthetic expressions) are treated by the same search operation as entire sentences; clauses of",
        "different types, such as relative clauses or independent clauses, are likewise treated by essentially the same search sequence.",
        "A control cycle insures that the different search sequences are called in the right order so that these different units are identified and related to each other appropriately.",
        "c. The heuristic principle of trial and evaluation is applied throughout the Fulcrum II algorithm.",
        "In all parts in the 'program where decisions are not unequivocal, a capability will exist for labeling decisions as provisional trials, so that they can be revised later in the program by evaluation routines based on information available to the program subsequently.",
        "6.",
        "The research principle of the Fulcrum approach is based on the interplay of theory and experimentation: by designing an experimental program based on an initial theoretical conception, this conception can be refined by computer experiments made possible by the availability of an experimental translation program at all times.",
        "7.",
        "The theoretical basis for the Fulcrum approach is the Definitional",
        "Model of Language proposed by the author, the methodological foundations are those of the inductive method developed by the author.",
