        "it will give enough insight into the capability of the algorithm and indicate to some extent the power of transformational analysis.",

        "Rather, we will present a set of examples of the decomposition and some discussion of them with the hope that it will give enough insight into the capability of the algorithm and indicate to some extent the power of transformational analysis.",
        "1.1 Transformations are certain relations among sets of sentences and in particular, it is possible to relate a given sentence to a set of elementary sentences (kernel sentences) by means of transformations.",
        "The kernel sentence forms (for English) are defined as the string of class marks N t V followed by one of the kernel object strings: T, N, NN, NPN, ND, PN, D, A (N: Noun; t: tense/aux; V: verb; P: preposition; D: adverb; A: adjective; T : zero).",
        "Thus John bought' a book; Mary will come etc.",
        "are kernel sentences.",
        "Each transformation is characterized by certain permutations, deletions or additions of specific class marks or constants.",
        "In the resultant of a transformation one may look for subsequences.",
        "which remain invariant even when the re, sultant is subjected to further transformations.",
        "The basic features of the algorithm are a) stating the various invariant sequences and b) formulating 1) a grammar of such invariant sequences, 2) a corre4.",
        "sponding recognition procedure, and 3) a systematic procedure for computing the kernel sentences as well as other kernel-like sentences and the corresponding transformational history.",
        "It should be emphasized that it is not assumed and also not implied in the algorithm that any kind of prior analysis (either string analysis or constituent analysis) is required as a prerequisite for the present algorithm.",
        "*Such a detailed description will appear later elsewhere.",
        "1.2 Transformations are initially defined on kernel sentence forms.",
        "However, they work on certain other sentence forms which are not kernel sentence forms.",
        "Thus a transformation is completely defined by first defining it on a suitable kernel sentence form(s) and then extending the 4Aomain of the transformation to other'sentence forms.",
        "This extel-sion which contains infinitely many sentence forms can be represented by first listing a finite number of sentence forms in the extension and all the remaining sentence forms in the extension are obtained by certain recursive rules (see the i-lists in 1.3).",
        "1.3 A unarm transformation transforms one sentence form into another sentence form and a binary transformation transforms a pair of sentence forms into another sentence form.",
        "Each unary transformation defined on a sentence form may be represented by a sequence of class marks constituting another sentence form.",
        "Most binary transformations can be defined as interruptions of certain unary transformation sequences at stated positions by certain other sequences of class marks.",
        "These interrupting sequences are not sentence forms but are deformations of sentence forms corresponding to the seem sentence form of the binary transformation.",
        "For example, John was detained by the old woman decomposes into woman detained John and woman t be old with a passive transformation on the first kernel and a binary transformation on the sentence John was detained by the woman and the kernel sentence woman t be old.",
        "1 The sentence form corresponding to the passive transformation, N t be en V by N is then interrupted by the sequence AN before the last symbol.",
        "AN is a deformation of the kernel sentence form N t be A which is the second sentence form of the binary transformation.",
        "The resulting sentence form is thus N t be en V by A N. In the resulting sentence form the shared symbol N appears only once.",
        "Such a symbol which two transformation sequences share (or on which they overlap) 'We ignore here the article the for simplicity.",
        "will be called a residue of one.sequence with respect to another.2 In addition to the transformation sequences which are sentence forms, and the interrupting sequences (deformed sentence forms) which correspond to most binary transformations, there is yet another type of interrupting sequences (again deformed sentence forms) which correspond to nominal-izations.",
        "For example consider: the book was written by Brown and John's travel to Italy was described by Mary.",
        "In the second sentence, the kernel sentence John travelled to Italy is mapped onto the object of Mary described before the resultant undergoes the same passive which acted on Brown wrote the book giving the first sentence.",
        "N's nV P N (John's travel to Italy) is a nominalization which appears in many different transformations and carries in them the associated kernel into one of the positions which could be occupied by a noun.",
        "For each _ transformation sequence in each intersymbol position we list all interrupting.",
        "sequences (including both the second and the third kind of sequences as discussed above).",
        "Of course, the interrupting sequences have their own interrupting sequences, etc.",
        "These intersymbol interrupting lists will be called i-lists.",
        "2.",
        "A sketch of the algorithm 2.0 As stated in 1, in order to define the set of all transforms we need a set of sequences of class marks (or class mark-like symbols) which has 3 subsets.",
        "1.",
        "Sequences each of which corresponds to a sentence form (e.g. the passive sequence N t be en V by N); 2.",
        "Sequences each of which represents a deformed kernel-form and is not a sentence form, but when inserted between specified neighboring symbols of a sequence of the first set, preserves the character of the sentence form (e.g. AN, en V N); 3.",
        "Sequences each of which represents a deformed kernel-form and is",
        "not a sentence form, but, when substituted for a symbol in a sequence (of set 1 or 2 or 3), preserves the character of that sequence (e.g. er V or-a- , n A of N).",
        "There are also rules for inserting sequences from the second set into other sequences or into sequences of the third set, without changing the character of either.",
        "All insertion or replacement rules are stated in the interruption lists appearing between every pair of adjacent symbols of each sequence.",
        "Most of the sequences in the first set represent unary transformations of kernel forms.",
        "Many are extended (often by permitting the replacement of certain symbols with selected sequences from the third set) to include analogous unary transforms of kernel-like forms.",
        "The second set of sequences, together with the rules of their insertion in the sequences for unary transformations, account for most of the binary transformations.",
        "Other binary transformations are represented by replacement in pairs of class marks in unary transformation sequences by members of the third set, most of which consist of nomin-alizations.",
        "An arbitrarily long English sentence form can be seen as composed of a finite number of such sequences recursively embedded in one another.",
        "2.1 Corresponding to the above three subsets of sequences and their mutual embedding rules, we recognize three sets of strings.",
        "Each string is a program for comparing one of the sequences with a portion of the analyzed sentence form of the data.",
        "The program is equipped to permit interruption by other such programs according to the i-lists - of the sequence.",
        "Each string, when entirely matched by a segment of data, replaces that segment with the carrier of the string.",
        "The carrier is sometimes null.",
        "In strings from the second set it is usually the residue of the binary insert (e.g. the center symbol of a noun phrase: N of AN, of ing In strings from the third set the carrier is a class-mark-like symbol which, by replacing a classmark in.a form derived from a kernel form, extends it to one simi",
        "larly derived from a kernel-like form.",
        "Let the carrier be N[nV] for a noun phrase built around an nV.",
        "The extended passive form: Kor N[nV]] t be en V by N represents the form of the sentence John's travel to Italy was described by Mary as soon as the carrier of the string replaces in the data the nominal segment John's travel to Italy.",
        "The carrier from all strings in the first set is S, a symbol of a well-formed sentence.",
        "The program 'of each string, whose sequence is a deformed (or transformed) kernel or kernel-like form, reconstructs that form for decomposition and attaches to it a label descriptive of the deformation (or transformation).",
        "The result of a decomposition is a set of kernel or kernel-like sentences with labels.",
        "Some of the kernel sentences are incomplete and have blanks in them because a transformation may (aelete - elements.",
        "Some kernel-like sentences may contain, instead of a w9rd, a class-mark-like symbol 5e.g.",
        "N) with a reference to a previous component of the decomposition.",
        "If that previous component is a kernel sentence (with or without blanks), then the label (describing the deformation) with the kernel-like form (containing the reference) with its label, together constitute a description of the transformation undergone by the component kernel sentence.",
        "If the previous component itself is a kernel-like sentence with a reference in turn to another component, both-kernel-like sentences and all three labels constitute the description of the transformation undergone by the component kernel sentence ultimately referred to, etc.",
        "If the symbol x appears, instead of a word, in a kernel or kernel-like sentence, it replaces a regular noun there.",
        "It is introduced in the sentence as a carrier from a nominalization such as a teacher of Latin, the driving instructor, etc.",
        "The same x must appear in two or more sentences of the decomposition (one where the nominal stands for a noun, and one in the sentence of which the nominalization is a deformation, e.g. x - teach Latin).",
        "Which x's require identical substitutions is discoverable, because each x has in a sharp bracket (< >) the names of every previous line in which the same x appeared.",
        "Often no actual substitution is possible and the x serves only to identify, with each other, two or more blanks in different components.",

        "Another body of such material is the dictionary.",
        "The dictionary associates to each English word a symbol representing the word's grammatical class, together with markers of certain additional characteristics the word may reveal by restricting its environment in the sentence.",
        "Some words may occur in more than one role and have therefore several equivalents in the dictionary.",
        "(e.g. the word labor should be given four different class marks: present tense V, V(untensed verb), IV (nominalization designating the activity of laboring), erV (nominalization designating the actor(s), possibly laborers in aggregate))."
