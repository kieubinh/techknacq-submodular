        "Summary of String Theory",
        "In writing a grammar of a natural language, one is faced with the problem of expressing grammatical deIndencies.",
        "For example, in the sentence form N V N (N, noun: V, verb), the subject N and the verb V must agree in number: The boy eats the meat; $ The boys eats the meat.",
        "Or, in the sequence Q N1 P N2 (Q a number; P, preposition), e.g., five feet in length, N1 and N2 are of particular subclasses: $ five feet in beauty.",
        "One of the theories of linguistic structure which is particularly relevant to this problem is linguistic string analysis [1].",
        "In this theory, the major syntactic structures of English are stated as a set of elementary strings (a string is a sequence of word categories, e.g., N V N, N V P N, etc.).",
        "Each sentence of the language consists of one elementary sentence (its center string) plus zero or more elementary adjunct strings which are adjoined either to the right or left or in place of particular elements of other elementary strings in the sentence.",
        "The elementary strings can be grouped into classes according to how and where they can be inserted into other strings.",
        "If Y = X1 X2 .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "Xn is an elementary string, X ranging over the category symbols, the following classes of strings are defined:",
        "IX left adjuncts of X: adjoined to a string Y to the left of X in Y, or to the left of an ix adjoined to Y in this manner.",
        "right adjuncts of X: adjoined to a string Y to the right of X in Y, rX or to the right of an rx adjoined to Y in this manner.",
        "ni replacement strings of X: adjoined to a string Y, replacing X in Y. sY sentences adjuncts of the string Y, adjoined to the left of Xi or afterX.in Y (l< i < n), or to the right of an sy adjoined to Y in this manner.",
        "c.conjunctionalstringsofY,conjoinedafterX.in Y (l< i < n), or to Y1 the right of a c.„.",
        "i adjoined to Y in this manner.",
        "z x, center strings, not adjoined to any string.",
        "These string-class definitions, with various restrictions on the repetition and order of members of the classes, constitute rules of combination on the elementary strings to form sentences.",
        "Roughly speaking, a center string is the skeleton of a sentence and the adjuncts are modifiers.",
        "An example of a left adjunct of V is the adjective green in the green blackboard.",
        "A right adjunct of N is the clause whom we met in the man whom we met.",
        "A replacement formula of N is, for example, what he said in the sentence What he said was interesting.",
        "The same sentence with a noun instead of a noun replacement string might be The lecture was interesting.",
        "Examples of sentence adjuncts are in general, at this time, since he left.",
        "The c strings have coordinating conjunctions at their head.",
        "An example is but left in He was here but left.",
        "Examples of center strings are He understood and also We wondered whether he understood.",
        "The grammatical dependencies are expressed by restrictions on the strings as to the word subcategories which can occur together in a string or in strings related by the rules of combination.",
        "Thus, in the center string Ni V N2, the",
        "grammatical dependency mentioned above is formulated by the restriction: if N is plural, then V does not carry the singular morpheme -s. The string 1 grammar with restrictions gives a compact representation of the linguistic data of a language, and provides a framework within which it is relatively simple to incorporate more linguistic refinement, i.e., more detailed restrictions.",
        "One may ask whether it is possible to write such a string grammar without any restrictions at all, i.e., to express the grammatical dependencies '(restrictions) in the syntactic structures themselves.",
        "In the resulting restrictionless grammar, any elements, which are related by a grammatical dependency will be.elements of the same elementary string.",
        "No grammatical relations, other than those given by the simple rule of string combination, obtain between two strings of a sentence.",
        "The result of this paper is to demonstrate that such a restrictionless grammar can be written [4].",
        "In order to obtain a restrictionless form of a string grammar of English, we take as a point of departure the grammar used by the computer program for string decomposition of sentences, developed at the University of Pennsylvania [2,3].",
        "This grammar is somewhat more detailed than the sketch of an English string grammar in [1].",
        "A summary of the form of the computer grammar is presented below in section 2.",
        "In section 3 we show how the restrictions can be eliminated from the grammar.",
        "An example of a typical output obtained for a short sentence from a text of a medical abstract is shown in Figs.",
        "1 and 2.",
        "The decomposition of the sentence into a sequence of nested strings is indicated in the output by the numbering of the strings.",
        "As indicated in line 1., the sentence consists of the two assertion centers in lines 2.and 40 conjoined by and.",
        "The line 3.",
        "contains a sentence adjunct (thus) on the assertion center as a whole .",
        "The assertion center 2 is of the form N V A : Spikes would be effective The noun spikes has a left adjunct (such enhanced) in line 5. , as indicated by the appearance of 5 to the left of spikes .",
        "The object effective has a left adjunct (more) in line 6. and a right adjunct in line 7.",
        "In the same way, each of the elements of the adjunct strings may have its own left and right adjuncts.",
        "Line 10 .",
        "contains an assertion center in which the subject and the modal verb (would) have been zeroed.",
        "This zeroing is indicated in the output by printing the zeroed element in parentheses.",
        "The difference between the two analyses in Figs.",
        "1 and 2 lies in the decomposition of the sequence in initiating synaptic action.",
        "In the first analysis (Fig.",
        "1), this sequence is taken as a P N right adjunct on effective, where initiating synaptic is a left adjunct (on action) of the form of a repeated adjective (parallel to escaping toxic in the sequence in escaping toxic gases) .",
        "In the second analysis (Fig.",
        "2), this same sequence is taken as a P Ving right adjunct of effective, where initiating is the Ving, and synaptic action is the object of initiating.",

        "The Computer String Grammar.",
        "In representing the string grammar in the computer, a generalized grammar string is used5 which is defined as",
        "(1) Y = Yi / Y2 / .",
        ".",
        ".",

        "This system of nested grammar strings terminates when one of the grammar strings is equal to an atomic string (one of the word-category symbols).",

        "sentence analysis program finds an instance of Y in the sentence being analyzed.",
        "Associated with each option Yi is a series of zero or more tests, called restrictions.",

        ".",
        "/ RnYn",
        "A restriction is a test (which will be described below) so written that if it does not give a positive result its attached option may not be chosen.",
        "All of the restrictions in the grammar fall into two types: Type A: The restrictions of type A enable one to avoid defining many similar related sets of grammar strings.",
        "The options of the grammar string Y have been chosen so that Y represents a group of strings which have related -5-linguistic properties.",
        "This allows the grammar to be written very compactly, and each grammar string can be formulated as best suits the linguistic data.",
        "However, when a grammar string Y appears as a Y'.. of some other string Y', some of the options of Y may lead to ij non-wellformed sequences.",
        "In order to retain the group of options of Y and yet not allow non-wellformed sequences wherever options of Y which would have that effect are used, we attach a restriction of type A to those options of Y.",
        "For example, let Y be",
        "(5) Y = y / Ra Y2 / • • 1",
        "where",
        "(6) Y1 = which E V (e.g., which he chose) and",
        "This yields Which he chose was important; What he chose was important.",
        "As it is defined here, Y can also be used to represent the wh-clauses in the right adjuncts of the noun:",
        "(8) Y' = rN = • • • / Y / • • but in rN only the which option of Y gives wellformed sequences: 3 the book which he chose 3/ the book what he chose",
        "Hence a restriction Ra is attached to the what option of.Y (eq.",
        "5) whose effect is to prevent that option from being used in rN.",
        "Type B: With some given set of rather broadly defined major categories (noun, verb, adjective, etc.)",
        "it is always possible to express more detailed linguistic relations by defining subcategories of the major categories.",
        "These relations then appear as constraints on how the subcategories may appear together in the grammar strings Y. IfsomeelementY..ofY.is an atomic string (hence a word-category ij symbol) representing some major category, say C, then Rb may exclude the subcategory C. as value of Yij if some other elementhas the value Ck.",
        "of Yik may also be a grammar string, in which case Rb may exclude a particular option of Yik when Y.. has value C.. ij The restrictions Rb may 'be classified into three kinds: (a)BetweenelementsofsOmerrespond to elements of a linguistic string.",
        "For example, A noun in the subcategory singular cannot appear with a verb in the subcategory plural.",
        "$ The man agree.",
        "Only a certain subcategory of adjective can appear in the sentence adjunct P A : in general, in particular, $ in happy.",
        "(b) Between a j Y.. and a Yik where Y. corresponds to an element of a linguistic ij a.",
        "string and Yik corresponds to a set of adjuncts of that element.",
        "For example, In rN, the string to V a cannot adjoin a noun of subcategory N2 (proper names): the man to do the job $ John to do the job.",
        "Only a certain adjective subcategory (e.g., present, available) can appear in rNwithout any left or right adjunct of its own: the people present ; t the people happy.",
        "(c) Between Y.. and Yik , where one corresponds to an element of a linguistic string and the other corresponds to an adjunct set which can repeat itself, i.e., which allows 2 or more adjuncts on the same linguistic element.",
        "These restrictions enable one to express the ordering among adjuncts in some adjunct sets.",
        "For example,",
        "Q (quantifier) and A (adjective) are both in the set kN , the left adjuncts of the noun.",
        "However, Q can precede A but A cannot precede Q when both are adjuncts of the same N in a sentence: 3QAN e.g., five green books , but 1AQN e.g., green five books.",
        "The string grammar defined by eqs.",
        "1-3, together with the atomic strings (word-category symbols) have the form of a BNF definition.",
        "The system with eq.",
        "4, however, departs from a BNF definition in two important respects:",
        "(a) it contains restrictions (tests) on the options of a definition; (b) the atomic strings (word-categories) of the grammar have sub-classifications.",
        "With the elimination of the restrictions, the computer grammar will again have the form of a BNF definition.",
        "3.",
        "Elimination of the Restrictions",
        "The restrictionless string grammar is obtained from the grammar described above by the methods of (A) and (B) below.",
        "Initially (in this paper), conjunctional strings have not been included in the restrictionless grammar.",
        "We estimate that the addition of conjunctional strings will increase the size of the restrictionless grammar by a factor of about 5.",
        "(A) The linguistic strings represented in the computer grammar are reformulated in accordance with the following requirement.",
        "Given any utterance of a language containing A .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "B .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", where a grammatical dependency obtains between A and B , the elementary strings of a restrictionless string grammar are defined so that A and B appear together in the same linguistic string, and any iterable sequence between A and B is an adjunct of that string.",
        "Iterable sequences of the type seemed to begin to in It seemed to begin to surprise him that we worked seriously , or is said to be known to in It is said to be known to surprise him that we worked seriously are analyzed as adjuncts.",
        "If we place such sequences among the left adjuncts of the verb, Iv , then the sentences above can be put in the form",
        "(9) It Iv surprise him that we worked seriously",
        "v = seemed to begin to ; is said to be known to ; etc.",
        "However, when the adjunct iv takes on the value zero (as can all adjuncts, by definition), then (9) above becomes the non-grammatical sequence It surprise him that we worked seriously.",
        "This happens because the first verb of iv (seemed or is) carries the tense morpheme, and the latter disappears when iv = 0.",
        "We separate the tense morpheme from the verb, and place it in the center string as one of the required elements.",
        "This formulation of the assertion center string Cl (10), in which the tense morpheme is an independent element and iterable sequences are taken as adjuncts, is necessary in order to preserve, for example, the dependence between the particle it and the succeeding sequence surprises him that we worked seriously: $ The book surprises him that we worked seriously.",
        "In the grammar which includes restrictions, this formulation is not necessary because this dependence can be checked by a restriction.",
        "(B) Turning to the coMputer form of the grammar, all the restrictions of the grammar are eliminated' either by defining new grammar strings (for the elimination of the restrictions Ra) or by replacing the general word-categories by the particular subclasses of those categories which are required by the restriction (to eliminate Rb).",
        "The application of this procedure increases the number of strings in the grammar, of course.",
        "The restrictions Ra can be eliminated in the following manner.",
        "Suppose the option Yi of Y has a restriction Ra on it which prevents it from being chosen in Y' (Y is a Y'.. of Y').",
        "Then define a new grammar string Y* which ij",
        "contains all the options of Y but Yi :",
        "Then the new grammar string Y* replaces Y in Y'.",
        "Thus, in the example of Ra on p. 5, the string Y* = which E t iv V /.... (in the modified treatment of tense and iterable sequences) would replace Y in rN.",
        "The restrictions Rb are eliminated in a different way, according to the types described on p. 6.",
        "(a) New strings must be written in which only the wellformed sequences of subcategories appear.",
        "In the example of subject-verb agreement, the original Yi (Yi = C1) must be replaced by two options:",
        "where Ns and N are singular and plural nouns, Vs and V singular and plural verbs.",
        "(b) If an element of a particular subcategory, say Ai, can take only a subset of the adjuncts rA, then a new adjunct string rAi is defined.",
        "It contains those options of rA which can appear only with Ai plus all the options of rA which are common to all the subcategories of A.",
        "When this has been done for all A. having some particular behavior with respect to rA, all the remaining subcategories of A will have a common adjunct string ra : A rA ->Ar /Ar / .",
        ".",
        "/Ar /Ar / .",
        ".",
        "1 Al 3 A3 .",
        "2 a 4 a As many new sets rAi must be defined as there were special subcategories of A.",
        "A similar argument holds for .QA and other adjunct sets which depend on A.",
        "(c) A new element corresponding to the/ adjunct set must be defined in which the adjuncts appear correctly ordered with respect to each other, and each one must be able to take on the value zero.",
        "This procedure for eliminating restrictions is also the algorithm for introducing further grammatical refinements into the restrictionless grammar.",
        "Such a general procedure can be formulated because of an essential property of a string grammar: In terms of linguistic (elementary) strings, all restrictions are either a) between elements of a string, or b) between an element of the string and its adjunct, or c) between related adjuncts of the same string.",
        "Further, there is no problem with discontinuous elements in a string grammar: all elements which depend in some way on each other grammatically appear in the same string or in strings which are contiguous by adjunction.",
        "The cost of the elimination of all restrictions in this way is about an order of magnitude increase in the number of strings of the grammar.",
        "Instead of about 200 strings of the computer grammar, the grammar presented here has about 2000 strings.",
        "It is interesting that the increase in the size of the grammar is not greater than roughly one order of magnitude.",
        "This suggests that there may be practical applications for such a grammar, e.g. in a program designed to carry out all analyses of a sentence in real time.",
        "Also, since the restrictionless grammar is equivalent to a B.N.F.",
        "grammar of English, it may prove useful in adding English-language features to programming languages which are written in B.N.F."
