        "- For English the association has been organized in a similar manner in the lists A/E, PIE, N/E, but in such a way that they are independent of German.",
        "An example may make this a little more clear.",
        "Assume that A/D1 is the German adverb \"drinnen\" and the factors 1, 3, 5, 8, * are coded symbols for the factors Ort, Lage, EinschluB, Betobung der einschlieBenden Grenzen, Hinweis, then according to thelprin-aiple of maximum agreement we are able to determine the same factor combination Place, Location, Interior, Accent on boundaries, Reference, in A/E under 1, which in English is the word \"inside\".",
        "With this same set of factors we find that in the lists P/D and P/E according to maximum agreement the results are P/D1 and P/E1, which are expressed as \"innerhalb\" and \"inside of\".",

        "for word with English prepositions.",
        "(This method was used frequently in the early days of machine translation resulting in untold difficulties.)",
        "Such word for word association is almost 100 % possible for the prepositions of place.",
        "But if, for example, we are dealing with the German word nach, which can either be P/D2 plus factor 7 (Zeit) or P/D4 plus factor 2 (Ort), we are not able to make a direct association, but must decide according to the method of maximum agreement whether English \"after\" or \"to\" is meant.",
        "The corresponding words in A/D and A/E would be \"danach\"-\"dorthint', and \"after that\"-\"there\".",

        "The selection of the fadtors Place and Time for, the respective noun classes in the noun class lists N/D and N/E would allow the generation of the phrases: \"nach dem Mittagessen\", -\"nach Köln\", and \"after lunch\", \"to Cologne\".",
        "Already it is evident how our system differs from those of earlier machine translation projects.",
        "In the nomo-association list we have established the prerequisites for generation, transformation and transition.",

        "This is one proof for the necessity of classifying nouns according to function or semantic classes.",
        "This can be illustrated in the following example.",
        "The codes in the preposition column are replaced by prepositions, and the row of noun classes by a representative of each class.",
        "For example, a BE-subject from the noun class\"abstract\"is compatible only with a BE-complement from the same class.",
        "Die Idee ist hinter dem Gedanken but not Der Gedanke ist hinter dem Garten Der Garten ist hinter dem Haus but not Der Garten ist hinter dem Mittagessen Not until all of these factors have been formalized and, all conditions which were illustrated in the matrices are taken into consideration it is possible to set up a final function matrix.",
