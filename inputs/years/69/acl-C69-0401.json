        "The resulting concept identifiers assigned to each document and search request are then matched, and the documents whose identifiers are sufficiently close to the queries are retrieved for the user's attention.",
        "The automatic analysis methods can be made to operate in real-time – while the customer waits for an answer – by restricting the query-document comparisons to only certain document classes, and interactive user-controlled search methods can be implemented which adjust the search request during the search in such a way that more useful, and less useless, material is retrieved from the file.",
        "The experimental evidence accumulated over the last few years indicates that retrieval systems based on automatic text processing methods – including fully automatic content analysis as well as automatic document classification and retrieval – are not in general inferior in retrieval effectiveness to conventional systems based on human indexing and human query formulation.",
        "One of the major objections to the practical utilization of the automatic text processing methods has been the inability automatically to handle foreign language texts of the kind normally stored in documentation and library systems.",
        "Recent experiments performed with document abstracts and search requests in French and German appear to indicate that these objections may be groundless.",
        "In the present study, the SMART document retrieval system is used to carry out experiments using as input foreign language documents and queries.",
        "The foreign language texts are automatically processed using a -3-thesaurus (synonym dictionary) translated directly from a previously available English version.",
        "Foreign language query and document texts are looked-up in the foreign language thesaurus and the analyzed forms of the queries and documents are then compared in the standard manner before retrieving the highly matching items.",
        "The language analysis methods incorporated into the SMART system are first briefly reviewed.",
        "Thereafter, the main procedures used to process the foreign language documents are described, and the retrieval effectiveness of the English text processing methods is compared with that of the foreign language material."

      "text": [
        "SMART is a fully-automatic document retrieval system operating on the IBM 7094 and 360 model 65.",
        "Unlike other computer-based retrieval systems, the SMART system does not rely on manually assigned key words or index terms for the identification of documents and search requests, nor does it use primarily the frequency of occurrence of certain words or phrases included in the texts of documents.",
        "Instead, an attempt is made to go beyond simple word-matching procedures by using a variety of intellectual aids in the form of synonym dictionaries, hierarchical arrangements of subject identifiers, statistical and syntactic phrase generation methods and the like, in order to obtain the content identifications useful for the retrieval process.",
        "Stored documents and search requests are then processed without any prior manual analysis by one of several hundred automatic content analysis methods, and those documents which most nearly match a given search request are extracted from the document file in answer to the request.",
        "The system may he controlled by the user, in that a search request can be processed -4-first in a standard mode; the user can then analyze the output obtained and, depending on his further requirements, order a reprocessing of the request under new conditions.",
        "The new output can again be examined and the process iterated until the right kind and amount of information are retrieved.",
        "[1,2,3] SMART is thus designed as an experimental automatic retrieval system of the kind that may become current in operational environments some years hence.",
        "The following facilities, incorporated into the SMART system for purposes of document analysis may be of principal interest: a) a system for separating English words into stems and affixes (the so-called suffix 's' and stem thesaurus methods) which can be used to construct document identifications consisting of the stems of words contained in the documents; b) a synonym dictionary, or thesaurus, which can be used to recognize synonyms by replacing each word stem by one or more \"concept\" numbers; these concept numbers then serve as content identifiers instead of the original word stems; c) a hierarchical arrangement of the concepts included in the thesaurus which makes it possible, given any concept number, to find its \"parents\" in the hierarchy, its \"sons\", its \"brothers\", and any of a set of possible cross references; the hierarchy can be used to obtain more general content identifiers than the ones originally given by going uk in the hierarchy, more specific ones by going down, and a set of related ones by picking up brothers and cross-references; d) statistical procedures to comi.ate similarity coefficients based on co-occurrences of concepts within the sentences of a given collection; the related concepts, determined by statistical association, can then be added to the originally available concepts to identify the various documents; e) syntactic analysis methods which make it possible to compare -5-the syntactically analyzed sentences of documents and search requests with a precoded dictionary of syntactic structures (\"criterion trees\") in such a way that the same concept number is assigned to a large number of semantically equivalent, but syntactically quite different constructions;",
        "f) statistical phrase matching methods which operate like the preceding syntactic phrase procedures, that is, by using a preconstructed dictionary to identify phrases used as content identifiers; however, no syntactic analysis is performed in this case, and phrases are defined as equivalent if the concept numbers of all components match, regardless of the syntactic relationships between components; g) a dictionary updating system, designed to revise the several dictionaries included in the system: i) word stem dictionary ii) word suffix dictionary iii) common word dictionary (for words to be deleted during analysis) iv) thesaurus (synonym dictionary) v) concept hierarchy vi) statistical phrase dictionary vii) syntactic (\"criterion\") phrase dictionary.",
        "The operations of the system are built around a supervisory system which decodes the input instructions and arranges the processing sequence in accordance with the instructions received.",
        "The SMART systems organization makes it possible to evaluate the effectiveness of the various processing methods by comparing the outputs produced by a variety of different runs.",
        "This is achieved by processing the same search requests against the same document collections several times, and making judicious changes in the analysis procedures between runs.",
        "In each case, the search effectiveness is evaluated by presenting paired comparisons of the average performance over many search requests for two given search and retrieval methodologies.",
        "-6-3.",
        "The Evaluation of Language Analysis Methods",
        "Many different criteria may suggest themselves for measuring the performance of an information system.",
        "In the evaluation work carried out with the SMART system, the effectiveness of an information system is assumed to depend on its ability to satisfy the users' information needs by retrieving wanted material, while rejecting unwanted items.",
        "Two measures have been widely used for this purpose, known as recall and precision, and representing respectively the proportion of relevant material actually retrieved, and the proportion of retrieved material actually relevant.",
        "[3] (Ideally, all relevant items should be retrieved, while at the same time, all nonrelevant items should be rejected, as reflected by perfect recall and precision values equal to 1).",
        "It should be noted that both the recall and precision figures achievable by a given system are adjustable, in the sense that a relaxation of the search conditions often leads to high recall, while a tightening of the search criteria leads to high precision.",
        "Unhappily, experience has shown that on the average recall and precision tend to vary inversely since the retrieval of more relevant items normally also leads to the retrieval of more irrelevant ones.",
        "In practice, a compromise is usually made, and a performance level is chosen such that much of the relevant material is retrieved, while the number of nonrelevant items which are also retrieved is kept within tolerable limits.",
        "In theory, one might expect that theiperformance of a retrieval system would improve as the language analysis methods used for document and query processing become more sophisticated.",
        "In actual fact, this turns out not to be the case.",
        "A first indication of the fact that retrieval effec--7- tiveness does not vary directly with the complexity of the document or query analysis was provided by the output of the Aslib-Cranfield studies.",
        "This project tested a large variety of indexing languages in a retrieval environment, and came to the astonishing conclusion that the simplest type of indexing language would produce the best results.",
        "[4] Specifically, three types of indexing languages were tested, called respectively single terms (that is, individual terms, or concepts assigned to documents and queries), controlled terms (that is, single terms assigned under the control of the well-known EJC Thesaurus of Engineering and Scientific Terms), and finally simple concepts (that is, phrases consisting of two or more single terms).",
        "The results of the Cranfield tests indicated that single terms are more effective for retrieval purposes than either controlled terms, or complete phrases.",
        "[4] These results might be dismissed as being due to certain peculiar test conditions if it were not for the fact that the results obtained with the automatic SMART retrieval system substantially confirm the earlier Cranfield output.",
        "[3] Specifically, the following basic conclusions can be drawn from the main SMART experiments: a) the simplest automatic language analysis procedure consisting of the assignment to queries and documents of weighted word stems originally contained in these documents, produces a retrieval effectiveness almost equivalent to that obtained by intellectual indexing carried out manually under controlled conditions; [3,5] b) use of a thesaurus lookup process, designed to recognize synonyms and other term relations by replacing the original word stems by the corresponding thesaurus categories, improves the retrieval effectiveness by about ten percent in both recall and -8-precision; c) additional, more sophisticated language analysis procedures, including the assignment of phrases instead of individual terms, the use of a concept hierarchy, the determination of syntactic relations between terms, and so on, do not, on the average, provide improvements over the standard thesaurus process.",
        "An example of a typical recall-precision graph produced by the SMART system is shown in Fig. 1, where a statistical phrase method is compared with a syntactic phrase procedure.",
        "In the former case, phrases are assigned as content identifiers to documents and queries whenever the individual phrase components are all present within a given document; in the latter case, the individual components must also exhibit an appropriate syntactic relationship before the phrase is assigned as an identifier.",
        "The output of Fig.l shows that the use of syntax degrades performance (the ideal performance",
        "region is in the upper right-hand corner of the graph where both the recall and the precision are close to 1).",
        "Several arguments may explain the output of Fig. 1: a) the inadequacy of the syntactic analyzer used to generate syntactic phrases; b) the fact that phrases are often appropriate content identifiers even when the phrase components are not syntactically related in a given context (e.g. the sentence \"people who need information, require adequate retrieval services\" is adequately identified by the phrase \"information retrieval\", even though the components are not related in the sentence); c) the variability of the user population which makes it unwise to overspecify document content; d) the ambiguity inherent in natural language texts which may work to advantage when attempting to satisfy the information needs of a heterogeneous user population with diverse information needs.",
        "-10-Most likely a combination of some of the above factors is responsible for the fact that relatively simple content analysis methods are generally preferable in a retrieval environment to more sophisticated methods.",
        "The foreign language processing to be described in the remainder of this study must be viewed in the light of the foregoing test results."
