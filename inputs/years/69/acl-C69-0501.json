        "This paper illustrates the use of a computer program as a tool in linguistic research.",
        "The program under consideration produces a concordance on words according to phonological segments and environments.",
        "Phonological segments are defined as a predetermined set of consonants and vowels.",
        "An environment is defined as the locus of occurrence of any of the phonological segments.",
        "The concordance facilitates the recognition of sound cor-respondances that lead to the reconstruction of a protolanguage.",
        "2.0.Program Description.",
        "The program for production of the concordance was written in the SNOBOL4 programming language, which was selected because of its pattern matching capabilities.",
        "The summary Flow Chart of the program, found in 67, should be adequate for the experienced reader.",
        "Nevertheless, a few general comments are in order.",
        "2.1.Initialization.",
        "All patterns to be used in the program are created during the Initialization.",
        "As originally conceived, the program was composed of one long run where 1 For a full exposition of SNOBOL4, see Griswold, R.E., Page, J.F., and Polonsky, I.P., The SNOBOL4 Programming Language.",
        "Holmdel, New Jersey: Bell.",
        "1968.",
        "2 all steps of the analysis were carried out.",
        "However, due to problems of internal storage caused by the numerous data, it was decided to run the program in two passes, each of which is explained below.",
        "2.2.Pass One.",
        "During the first pass of the program all cards of an item are read.",
        "An item is defined as the Classical Latin dictionary form, followed by the author's phonemicization of the Latin form according to the most conservative estimate of the maximal phonological system capable of giving rise to the various dialects of spoken Latin.",
        "These two elements are followed optionally by the modern reflexes in as many as eleven dialects from the area commonly subsumed under the heading Franco-Proven-cal.",
        "An optional comment concludes the item.",
        "As the items are read, determination is made of the largest size of each element for later column alignment in the printout.",
        "Each item is then stored as a string named after the sequential number assigned to the item, and the phonological form on which the concordance will be based is selected.",
        "The phonological form is then analyzed, in order to retain the generic types and specific segment-environments occurring in that phonological form.",
        "A generic type is defined as a consonant or vowel in a given environment, as for example, word-initial consonant",
        "or tonic free vowel.",
        "A specific segment-environment is defined as one certain consonant or vowel in a given environment, as for example, word-initial P or tonic free A.",
        "For each specific segment-environment found, a list is created composed of the numbers of the items containing that specific segment-environment.",
        "As all items are read and analyzed, errors in phonological form are outputted.",
        "After the analysis of all input items is completed, a generic type list is examined for a specific segment-environment.",
        "From the list named after that specific segment-environment the numbers of the items containing the specific segment-environment are obtained and the items are written onto tape in condensed form for accessing in Pass Two, 2.3.Pass Two.",
        "During the second pass.",
        "the condensed listings are accessed from the tape, along with the largest size of each element, and alignment of columns is made just prior to printing for easier reading of the printout.",
        "3.0.Specification.",
        "The program is designed to list all words in a dialect (for example, Latin or a present-day dialect of Latin) containing a specific segment in a given environment.",
        "The order for the production of the lists is outlined in the following paragraphs.",
        "3.1.Single Consonants.",
        "All words containing single conson4",
        "ants are listed according to two parameters: a predetermined order of those consonants and, within that parameter, according to the following environments: word-initial, ge-minate, syllable-initial, syllable-final, and word-final position.",
        "A geminate consonant is defined as a long consonant, sometimes described as double, occurring across syllable boundaries.",
        "3.2.Clusters.",
        "A cluster is defined as the occurrence of two or more consonants in immediate succession in the same syllable.",
        "All words containing clusters of two consonants are listed according to the parameters of g3.1, but in reverse order.",
        "This order of consonants is the same as the order used to list single consonants with the additional stipulation that the value of the consonant in leftmost position have precedence over the one in rightmost posi-lon, as in any dictionary order.",
        "Lists of words containing clusters of three or more consonants follow, according to the same parameters as those specified for two-consonant clusters.",
        "Where there are different numbers of consonants (three or more) in the clusters, the words are listed giving the highest value to the consonant in the nth position, followed by the consonant in the n 1th position (counting consonants from left to right), and according to the predetermined order of con"

        "Words containing strong sequences, composed of a geminate consonant plus at least one additional consonant, are listed first, and the sequence is abbreviated C1.C1Cn.",
        "The order of the listing is the same as that specified in Â°3.1, except that there is only one environment, \"strong.\" For example, given the predetermined order KPWFSTDMNRBLJGQXZ, listings of words having the following strong sequences would appear in this orders K.KL, K.KJ, P.PJ, T.TJ, N.NTR, N.NTRJ.",
        "Following the words containing strong sequences, all other sequences are listed.",
        "The first words listed are those with two-consonant sequences; that is, sequences with only one consonant on either side of the syllable boundary, abbreviated C1.02' Then all words containing sequences of a single consonant followed by a syllable boundary,",
        "followed by more than one consonant, abbreviated Ci.C2Cn, are listed; followed by words containing all other sequences, abbreviated CnC.C(Cn), where the parentheses indicate optionality.",
        "In each of these listings the consonant or syllable boundary in the nth position has higher value than the consonant in the n 1th position (consonants being counted from left to right).",
        "For example, if the following sequences were found, they would be listed in the following order: M.P, R.L, N.STJ, R.LJ, NT.T, NT.TJ.",
        "3.5.Vowels.",
        "Words containing vowels are listed next, according to the following ordered parameters and subparameters: stress (tonic, pre-tonic, post-tonic), length (long, non-long), position (in free or checked syllable), and the predetermined order of vowels.",
        "For example, given the predetermined order IEAOU, the listings would occur In the following order: all words containing long tonic free I III 0 I!",
        "0 \" E",
        "II II 0 II II \" U, and so on, through the long tonic checked vowels, the non-long tonic free and checked vowels, the long pre-tonic free and checked vowels, the non-long pre-tonic free and checked vowels, etc., until all possible combinations of parameters have been listed.",
        "3.6.Special Environments.",
        "Listed lastly are occurrences",
        "of the so-called velar consonants /k g kw gw/ (symbolized in the program as K,G,Q,X) followed by a front vowel or /j/.",
        "These lists are called \"special\" and are printed as a separate portion of the print-out, because of the well-known phenomen of the palatalization of these Latin consonants plus a front vowel or /j/.",
        "3.7.Errors.",
        "Toward the end of the first pass, before the condensed listings are outputted onto the tape, certain errors are printed out.",
        "Errors may be errors in phonological form, as for example, use in the phonological form of a consonant symbol that has not been pre-defined, failure to punch a syllable boundary, or failure to punch length or stress symbols; or the error may be the lack of occurrence of the phonological form for which the program is searching.",
        "3.8.Alignment.",
        "The second pass is almost entirely composed of the subroutine in which the elements of an item are aligned in columns in the listings on the basis of the number of characters in the longest occurrence of that particular element.",
        "4,0.Instructions to User.",
        "A system of symbolization for vocalic and consonantal specific segments must be decided on.",
        "During the processing there must be only one computer character for each segment the computer will examine.",
        "If 8 it is necessary (because of the non-availability of many customary linguistic symbols as characters in the computer alphabet) to encode the data with two symbols for one phonological segment, the program should have all the double symbols used and the corrseponding single computer symbols by which the program will process the data defined.",
        "Because of peculiarities in the program it is also necessary to change any numbers, V, or C, that may be used as consonantal or vocalic symbols in the phonological form to be concordanced on to some other unique computer symbol.",
        "For example, if theta and delta are encoded as TH and DH, and if the symbols C, V, and 5 are used in the input program and in the representation of a specific phonological segment, then the following two statements should be inserted at the appropriate place in the program:",
        "where a,,b, c, d, and e are unique symbols belonging to the character set of the particular computer, and different from other symbols punched in the phonological form to be concordanced on.",
        "In the present program double symbols are freely used in the transcription of the dialect reflexes.",
        "If a concordance is to be produced on the basis of one of the dialects, the above modifications must still apply.",

        "cordance on the second element of an item, the phonological representation of the spoken Latin form.",
        "To produce a concordance on a dialect, the phonological form to be concordanced on must be redefined.",
        "A special environment may be searched for and listed separately by means of the insertation of a statement defining an appropriate pattern in the Initialization of the program, and by the placement of a search for that pattern in the body of the program.",
        "If one is producing a concordance on a particular dialect, then special environments may be defined according to symbols used in that particular dialect.",
        "4.2.Encoding of the Data.",
        "All cards will have information beginning in column one and may have information punched continuously through column seventy-five.",
        "Columns seventy-six through eighty may be uniquely sequentially numbered for each entry (column seventy-nine having units position and column eighty being saved for insertions).",
        "A linguistic unit may be split between cards; in such cases no hyphenation will be needed.",
        "That is, in all instances the information beginning in the first column of the second and subsequent cards of an entry will be abutted to the seventy-fifth column of the previous card.",
        "The first card of an item will begin in column one with the dictionary entry of the Latin word, with both 10 vowel length and stress indicated, followed by two spaces.",
        "Indication of stress is redundant, stress being predictable in Classical.",
        "Latin.",
        "However, stress is indicated in dictionary fashion, as an aid toward rapid recognition of the proper stress by the reader.",
        "Though the accusative singular of Classical Latin nouns is the citation form, with few exceptions, for the first element, the final m has in all instances been omitted.",
        "Thus, where the noun nox is cited, it is spelled N0-CTE, rather than N0-CTEM, to save space, and because texts which cite spoken Latin nouns usually cite such nouns without final m. The asterisk is used to indicate an unattested Classical Latin form, in most inf.",
