        "Redundancy is a well-known phenomenon of phonemes or phonological matrices within the framework of the distinctive-feature theory of JAKOBSON and HALLE [1] .",
        "Redundancy in this theory means that the specification (either + or -) of certain features of a phoneme is predictable given the specifications of certain other features of the same phoneme and/or of neighbouring phonemes of a phoneme sequence.",
        "These restrictions on feature specifications are usually expressed by \"redundancy rules\".",
        "E.g. in English all nasal phonemes are voiced which is expressed by a rule [+nasal] --* Evoiced], to be read as \"each phoneme which is specified &nasal] must also be specified [+voiced]\".",
        "Among the redundancy rules usually two main types are distinguished.",
        "Those like the one just mentioned which express a restriction valid for each phoneme of a language, independent of possible neighbouring phonemes, will be called \"phoneme-structure rules\" (P-rules) in this paper.",
        "Besides them, there are rules expressing restrictions on the admissible phoneme sequences of the language, e.g. in English no [1-consonantal segment can follow a morpheme-initial nasal; they will be called (as usual) \"morpheme-structure rules\" (M_rules).",

        "At any rate, STANLEY's results show that a formalized treatment of phonological redundancy is sensible.",
        "Most recently, redundancy rules have been discussed in the work of CHOMSKY and HALLE [5] â€¢ The results of the present paper essentially confirm - as far as the questions are the same - the results of STANLEY being, however, somewhat more precise than his.",
        "The main result is that the complete set of P-rules for a set of fully specified phonemes can be derived from the prime implicants of a certain Boolean function and thus computed without recurrence to linguistic intuition, given only the set of phonemes.",
        "Algorithms for this task can be found in the mathematical literature (e.g. McCLUSKEY [6] ).",
        "This formulation then also allows in a simple way to test intuitively found P-rules for compatibility with a given set of phonemes.",
        "No hierarchy of the features need be assumed for this.",
        "Moreover, it is shown that phoneme sequences can be treated formally like single phonemes (with a higher number of features); thus all results for single phonemes hold for phoneme sequences as well, and M-rules are not essentially different from P-rules.",
        "Furthermore, some ideas are given how to compute from a set of P-rules another set of rules which generate just the non-redundantly specified matrices, i.e. the lexicon; these rules are called \"lexicon rules\" (I,-rules).",
        "Finally, two questions connected with the introduction into phonological matrices of blanks for redundant specifications are discussed, viz. \"When do different matrices remain distinct - in the technical sense of [2] , p.408 - after introduction of blanks?\" and \"Is the position of blanks in matrices uniquely determined by the redundancy rules alone or has an order of application of the rules to be taken into account?\".",
        "It is shown that both distinctness and uniqueness are guaranteed if a hierarchy (a total ordering) is introduced, among the features and if the feature on the right hand side of a rule is required to have higher rank with respect to this hierarchy - e.g. usually [voiced] is given higher rank than [vocalic] - than any feature on the left hand side of the rule.",
        "Counterexamples show that neither distinctness nor uniqueness necessarily hold if this requirement is not met.",
