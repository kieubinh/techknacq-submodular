        "In this paper I describe a system for the on-line semantic analysis of texts of up to paragraph length.",
        "It was programmed and applied in Q32 LISP 1.5 to material of two sorts: newspaper editorials and passages of classical philosophical argument.",
        "The immediate purpose of the analysis was to resolve the word-sense ambiguity of the texts: to tag each word of the texts to one and only one of its possible senses or meanings, and to do so in such a way that anyone could judge the output's success or failure without knowing the coding system.",
        "The system tackles texts of up to paragraph length because I take it as a working hypothesis that many word-sense ambiguities cannot be resolved within the bounds of the conventional text sentence; there simply isn't enough context available.",
        "The system attempts to detect semantic forms (which I call templates) directly in coded text, and not by means of a conventional syntax analysis.",
        "This restriction sets the present approach apart from the better-known ones.",
        "However, an approach like the present one still has to show how to obtain the information contained in a conventional syntax analysis, and I shall do that below.",
        "For each paragraph of text examined the system derives a nested structure of the semantic templates, which can be thought of as its semantic representation.",
        "I shall show, it may be necessary for the system to enlarge its own dictionary in an on-line mode in order to obtain such a representation.",
        "From a representation, a word-sense resolution of the text is read off and printed out, since the representation contains one and only one sense representation for each constituent word of the text.",
        "2.",
        "The basic item, the template, is intended to express, in coded form, the message content of an elementary clause or sentence.",
        "Thus, if we had to analyse the sentence \"The old postman is angry\", I would expect to match with it a template that could be interpreted as \"A certain kind of man is in a certain state\".",
        "Similarly, if analysing the clause \"The wicked wizard\", I would expect to match with it a template that could be interpreted \"a man is of a certain kind\".",
        "The main hypothesis of the system of sense analysis is that one can build up a 'proper semantic sequence' of such templates as a representation of \"semantically compatible\" fragments of text.",
        "At the end of the paper I shall discuss the possibility of explicating; the difficult notion of \"meaningful language\".",
        "But at the beginning I am assuming that, if a text is meaningful then its parts must cohere together in some structured way, and that \"semantic compatibility\" might express that way.",
        "This working hypothesis will also mean that the word-senses that can participate in such a proper sequence will be the appropriate ones.",
        "By \"appropriate senses\" I mean simply the dictionary word-senses that a translator of the text would wish to distinguish from the inappropriate ones.",
        "By way of example, I shall consider the semantic compatibilities of the fragments of a paragraph - to be found in a'Times\"editorial in December 1966.",
        "As given below it has been fragmented by functions whose operations I shall describe â€¢ - but I shall assume that it is comprehensible as a sequence ofitwelve items: *note",
        "Fig.1.",
        "A paragraph in fragment form and it's semantic compatibilities.",
        "Let's now look at possible semantic compatibilities between fragments of the paragraph (marked with braces in the left hand margin of the figure above).",
        "Fragments 1 & 2 are semantically compatible (both essentially assert that a structure is of a certain sort: (1) that a system is changing, (2) that a structure is the public's.) This requires that one takes \"to be of a certain sort\" in its usual wide logical sense to cover such notions as change and movement:",
        "4 & 5 are semantically compatible (both essentially assert that something is moving in some way).",
        "7 & 8 are semantically compatible (both essentially assert that the railways are near to us in time in some way).",
        "9 & 10 are semantically compatible (both essentially assert that something is taking or removing something).",
        "4.",
        "11 & 12 are semantically compatible (both essentially assert that some structure is changing or about to change).",
        "Notice that semantic parallelisms of this sort between fragments are sufficient to resolve at least one ambiguity in each of the pairs of fragments: for example the correct sense of \"habits\" for fragment 2 is \"structure of behaviour\", rather than the less-common \"articles of dress\".",
        "Thus Pointing out this parallelism is also selecting the appropriate sense of \"habits\"."
