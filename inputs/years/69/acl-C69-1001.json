        "It is obvious to native users of these characters, however, that the graphic patterns are mostly composed of different but frequently used subunits, and regularity is observed in the structures of character patterns.",
        "Quite frequently, a character is clearly composed of more than one character (with some minor modifications in shape).",
        "We can intuitively identify some commonly used strokes such as vertical and horizontal lines as constituents of characters or their sub-parts.",

        "There is obvious difference between Chinese and Japanese in the collection of character patterns used, but difference in the structural regularity itself is not apparent and remains to be studied.",

        "Namely, the system of rules given here generates aracter-like patterns, but it does not define the actual set of Chi-se characters, viz, the accepted vocabulary of either Chinese or panese, but rather the set of patterns each of which could repre-nt a Chinese character as far as the structural characteristics of pattern are concerned.",
        "The regularity described here is thus )re like phonological regularities of lexical items of a language in syntactic regularities of its sentences.",
        "Nevertheless, the for-ii similarity of this rule system with the transformational theory syntax is rather interesting.",
        "The abstract representation of a character according to the gen-ative rules make it possible to specify the patterns of essentially Chinese characters completely in terms of elements (strokes) d operators (concatenators and compounders).",

        "The first numeral of the stroke identifier represents the class of the stroke and the second the variation within the class.",
        "For example, the stroke \"21\", which is the first variational stroke of class-two, is defined by the stroke pattern as shown in Fig. 1.",
        "For each stroke, three functional points pl., , , w are defined in terms of their x-y coordinate values in the stroke pattern field covering a range of integer values 0-4 for both x and y.",
        "A stroke with its three functional points can be represented by the following format (s-representation for the stroke): [21; 20, 22, 24].",
        "In this representation, the first number (21) is the stroke identifier, and the following three sets of numerals represent the x (on the left) and y (on the right) coordinates of the points 0(.. , and co , respectively.",
        "Concatenators are listed in Table 2, A concatenator defines a particular positional interrelation between two strokes in terms of coincidence of a pair of the functional points.",

        "For the example above, the stroke positions are represented as: [21; 00,02,04 11; 00,20,40 21; 40,42,42 21; 20,22,24 11; 02,22,42 11; 04,24,44].",

        "In the case of the zero, the strokes are separated in the same manner, but at the same time a special stroke of the opposite class (horizontal line for class2 degenerate strokes and vertical line for class-1 degenerate strokes) is automatically introduced in s-representation.",

        "A system is proposed for specifying any one of the accepted patterns of Chinese characters, or similar patterns that could be used as Chinese characters.",
        "The system may be considered as a generative grammar of the set of character patterns.",
        "A unit is formed by concatenating strokes by operators.",
        "A set of strokes is given in a stroke table where three abstract functional points 0( , , , as well as a typical actualization form, are defined for each stroke.",
        "Concatenators and pseudoconcatenators are provided, each of them defining a particular positional interrelation between two strokes in terms of coincidence of the functional points.",
        "The set of strokes is divided into two functionally distinct groups, and a concatenator can combine only a pair of strokes of different groups, a pseudoconcatenator only those of the same group.",
        "Thus a string of alternating strokes and operators, which may be called the \"i-representation, \" determines an underlying form of a unit, which can be actualized as a character shape through looking up the stroke table and executing some shape-adjusting rules.",
        "On the level of i-representation, more than one unit can be combined to form a more complex character pattern, by use of one or more of compounding operators that specify \"transformational processes\" to be executed before the shape adjustment process.",
        "Preliminary results of an on-line computer experiment will be shown where the actualizations of characters are displayed on an oscilloscope when characters are specified by typing in the i-representations."
