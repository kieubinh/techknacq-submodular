        "The work described in the present paper represents a combination of two widely different approaches to the study of language.",
        "The first of these, the automatic generation of sentences by computer, is recent and highly specialized: Yngve (1962), Sakai and Nagao (1965), Arsent'eva (1965), Lomkovskaja (1965), Friedman (1967), and Harper (1967) have applied a sentence generator to the study of syntactic and semantic problems of the level of the (isolated) sentence.",
        "The second, the study of units of discourse larger than the sentence, is as old as rhetoric, and extremely broad in scope; it includes, in one way or another, such diverse fields as beyond – the sentence analysis (cf. Hendricks, 1967) and the linguistic study of literary texts (Bailey, 1968, 53-76).",
        "The present study is an application of the technique of sentence generation to an analysis of the paragraph; the latter is seen as a unit of discourse composed of lower – level units (sentences), and characterized by some kind of structure.",
        "To repeat: the object of our investigation is the paragraph; the technique is analysis by synthesis, i.e. via the automatic generation of strings of sentences that possess the properties of paragraphs.",
        "-2 – Harper's earlier sentence generation program differed from other versions in its use of data on lexical co – occurrence and word behavior, both obtained from machine analysis of written text.",
        "These data are incorporated with some modifications in a new program designed to produce strings of sentences that possess the properties of coherence and development found in \"real\" discourse.",
        "(The actual goal is the production of isolated paragraphs, not an extended discourse.)",
        "In essence the program is designed (0 to generate an initial sentence; (ii) to \"inspect\" the result in order to determine strategies for producing the following sentence; (iii) to build a second sentence, making use of one of these strategies, and employing, in addition, such criteria of cohesion as lexical class recurrence, substitution, anaphora, and synonymy; (iv) to continue the process for a prescribed number of sentences, observing both the general strategic principles and the lexical context.",
        "Analysis of the output will lead to modification of the input materials, and the cycle will be repeated.",
        "This paper describes the implementations of these ideas, and discusses the theoretical implications of the paragraph generator.",
        "First we give a description of the language materials on which the generator operates.",
        "The next section deals with a program which converts the language data into tables with associative links to minimize -3 – the storage requirement and access time.",
        "Section 4 describes: (1) the function of the main components of the generation program, (2) the generation algorithm.",
        "Section 5 describes the implementation of some linguistic assumptions about semantic and structural connections in a discourse.",
        "The governing probabilities for a word are independent of each other.",
        "In paragraph generation the decision to select a dependent type will be made without regard to the selection of other dependent types.",
        "For example, a noun can have probabilities P6 and P7 of being the governor of a noun and an adjective respectively.",
        "The selection of a noun as a dependent based on P6 will not affect, and will not be affected by, the selection of an adjective as a dependent.",
        "There are two types of co – occurrence data accompanying every word in the glossary: a set of governing probabilities and a list of dependents.",
        "The probability values associated with a word are determined on the basis of the syntactic behavior of the word in the processed text.",
        "If a noun occurs in 75 instances as the governor of an adjective in 100 occurrences in a text, the probability of having an adjective as a dependent is 0.75.",
        "The zeroes and ones in Table 1 are constant for all words in the glossary.",
        "These values are not listed in the sets of probability values for the entries of the glossary; however, they are known to the system.",
        "For instance, the set of probability values for a transitive verb will contain P1, P2, and P3.",
        "The probability 1 of governing a noun as object will not be listed in the data.",
        "The second type of co – occurrence data accompanying every word in the glossary is a list of possible dependents.",
        "The list is specified in terms of word numbers and semantic classes (to be described later).",
        "It contains the words that actually appear in the processed physics text as dependents of the word with which the list is associated.",
        "Since the lists of dependents are compiled on the basis of word co – occurrence in the text, legitimate word combinations are guaranteed.",
        "In the list of dependents for a verb, those words which can only be the subject are marked \"S\" and those which can only be the direct object are marked \"0\".",
        "The co – occurrence data can be regarded as either syntactic or semantic.",
        "They are distinguished here from both the dependency rules and part of speech designation, and from the semantic classes that have been established.",
        "At present, seventy – four semantic classes have been set up.",
        "Some of these are formed distributionally (i.e., on the -7 – basis of their tendency to co – occur syntactically with the same words in text – cf.",
        "Harper, 1965); other classes contain words of the same root, synonyms, hypernyms, and words arbitrarily classified as \"concrete.\"",
        "The semantic classifications are highly tentative, and are subject to modification.",
        "Their extent is shown in Table 2.",
        "The language materials described above are punched on approximately 2500 cards.",
        "The data are processed by a conversion program in order to form the data base for the paragraph generation program.",

        "It consists of two main programs: a data conversion program and a generation program.",
        "These two programs run as separate jobs.",
        "The data conversion program converts the language materials described above into compact data tables with associative links.",
        "The converted data are stored on a magnetic tape which is used as input to the generation program.",
        "During the process of paragraph generation it is desirable that the language data described in the preceding section remain in core storage.",
        "However, since the data base is rather large, its conversion into a more compact and flexible form is desirable so that storage requirements and access time can be reduced.",
        "In view of the characteristics of the language data and the generation algorithm (to be described later), we structure the data base in the following way.",
        "a.",
        "Words belonging to the same parts of speech or semantic classes are stored in consecutive locations.",
        "In the process of generation, random selection of a word from a part of speech or a semantic class is often required.",

        "-9 – b.",
        "The data storage for each entry of the glossary is of variable length, since the lists of dependents, governing probabilities, hypernyms and semantic classes associated with the entries are of variable length.",
        "c. Word numbers in the lists of dependents and semantic classes are replaced by pointers, which identify the locations where the word numbers are actually stored.",
        "Thus, data tables containing different types of information are linked to one another, and access to this information can be carried out by straight table lookup.",
        "In keeping with these principles, data tables of the form shown in Fig. 1 have been constructed.",
        "An example will illustrate the organization of the data base and the procedure of setting up these data tables.",
        "As a noun, represented by word number 2466, and its associated language data are read from the input unit, the word number is stored in the block in table (1) reserved for nouns.",
        "The last three digits of the word number are used as an index to a location in the lookup table (2), where the word number 2466 and its address in table (1), i.e. 309, are stored.",
        "If the location in table (2) has been occupied (when more than one word has the same last three digits), the word number and its address are stored at the first unused space in table (2) following that location.",
        "Table (2) allows us to replace word numbers with their addresses after all data have been processed.",
        "-11 – There are four pointers associated with each word stored in table (1).",
        "Pointer D specifies the location in table (4) where the list of dependents associated with the word is stored.",
        "A counter is used to specify the number of words and semantic classes in the list.",
        "A semantic class in the original data is prefixed by a C (C1 identifies semantic class 1).",
        "In table (4) all the counters and semantic classes (the numerical values) are stored as negative values so that the positive values (i.e. word numbers) can be conveniently changed to pointers at a later stage.",
        "In our example the pointer D is 130 and the words 726 and 4594, and also the semantic classes Cl, C2 and C16, are in the dependent list associated with word 2466.",
        "The value which identifies a semantic class in table (4) is actually a pointer to a table which contains the starting locations of the lists of words in all semantic classes.",
        "This is illustrated in Fig. 1 by the links from table (4) through table (8) to table (3).",
        "The set of governing probabilities associated with word 2466 is stored in table (7).",
        "Pointer P specifies the starting location where the probability values are stored.",
        "In the example, P is set to 142.",
        "Notice that no spaces are reserved for adjectives and adverbs because they do not have governing probabilities.",
        "The pointer H associated with a word in table (1) specifies the location in table (5) where a counter and -12 – the hypernyms of the word are stored.",
        "Word 613 is a hypernym of the word 2466.",
        "Thus, H is set to 17 which is the location in table (5) where a counter and the word 613 are stored.",
        "Since the word 2466 is a member of the semantic class C47, the pointer S associated with the word 2466 is set to the location in table (6) where a counter and C47 is stored.",
        "Table (3) contains 74 blocks, which are reserved for the 74 semantic classes established in the system.",
        "Each block contains a counter and the addresses of the words in a semantic class.",
        "For example, the address 309 is stored in the 47th block in table (3).",
        "Table (3) is thus linked to table (1).",
        "After all data have been entered in the tables, the word numbers (positive values) in tables (4) and (5) are replaced by their addresses in table (1).",
        "This operation is done by using the lookup table (2).",
        "The data are organized in tables with associative links.",
        "All word numbers in tables (3), (4), and (5) are replaced by their addresses in table (1).",
        "From an entry in table (1) (where the generation of a sentence usually begins), we can trace its possible dependents; since these dependents are specified as pointers to their addresses in table (1), it is simple to obtain the lists of dependents associated with these dependents.",
        "In turn we can trace thir level dependent lists.",
        "We can easily continue this operatio -13 – down to any desired level.",
        "Table (1) is linked to tables (4), (5), (6), and (7), and tables (4), (5), and (6) are linked either directly back to table (1) or indirectly through table (8) and then table (3) back to table (1).",
        "Thus, access to any piece of information in these data tables is gained by simple table lookup.",
        "In view of the variability in the number of words in each part – of – speech and semantic class, and in the number of governing probabilities, hypernyms, semantic classes and dependents associated with each word, we have packed these data in large arrays as illustrated in tables (1), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7).",
        "The advantages are (i) reduction in storage requirements, and (ii) capacity for rapid selection of a word from a part of speech or a semantic class.",
        "The disadvantage is that we have placed a restriction on the amount of additional data that may be added to the existing lists.",
        "To avoid modifying the program when new data are added, indices (such as x, y, and z in Fig. 1) to the reserved spaces in tables (1), (3), and (7) are made input parameters to the program.",
        "At present the parameters are set to leave space for expansion of input data.",
        "Further expansion can be handled simply by readjusting the input parameters.",

        "The subject of the sentence should not govern an adjective.",
        "As illustrated in the pattern, each node in a pattern contains a word class and selection restrictions which are positively or negatively specified in terms of semantic class(es), specific word(s) or a word class.",

        "Since the verb investigate in sentence (a) belongs to semantic class C2, and C2 contains such verbs as \"study\" and \"investigate\" which specify very general actions, the node VT(+C7) in pattern 2 controls the selection of a verb of greater specificity; the verbs in C7 are appropriate.",
        "The node VT(+C7) in pattern 3 serves this purpose, i.e., to control the development of actions from generality to specificity.",
        "The node NS(+C16) in pattern 2 specifies that an agent for the second sentence is not the present author implicitly specified in the third sentence.",
        "This restriction introduces another type of text development, i.e. from other writer to present author.",
        "The node DV(+C19) in pattern 1 and pattern 2, and node DV(+C20) in pattern 3 introduce the time progression and location change to the paragraph.",
        "Class C19 contains such adverbs as \"in an earlier paper,\" \"in paper 1,\" \"in an earlier study,\" etc., which specify that the time is past.",
        "Class C20 contains such adverbs as \"in the present work,\" \"in the present paper,\" etc.",

        "For example, the verbs in all sentences are in some degree related, and a general parallelism is maintained in the selection of agents and adverbs of time and location.",
        "Nonetheless it is clear that sentences a. through d. do not form n good paragraph.",
        "One deficiency is the excessively general character of the noun phrase, \"the nature of scattering,\" in a.; a more obvious shortcoming is the lack of continuity in the noun object.",
        "Such deficiencies suggest the need for greater cohesion.",

        "Cohesion As a first approximation we have chosen to implement the following principles of cohesion: (1) selection of a \"concrete\" word in noun phrases; (2) word repetition; (3) use of hypernyms and synonyms; (4) use of anaphoric words; (5) increased repetition of members of the same semantic classes; (6) avoidance of word repetition within a single noun phrase.",
        "The implementation of these tactics is carried out in the reweighting table described in Sec. 4.",
        "In essence each tactic is a criterion for determining which words and semantic classes, together with reweighting values, are to be entered into the reweighting table.",
        "The content of the table depends on the criteria applied for each word selection; the main generation routine accepts the table as input for control of the selection, without \"knowing\" which criteria are used in forming the table.",

        "increases continuity in the sentence sequence.",
        "The generation program achieves word repetition in adjacent or nearly adjacent sentences by entering the noun – subjects or noun – objects of previously generated sentences (the -33--choice between noun – subject or noun – object is made by reference to the restriction pattern for the sentence being generated) into the reweighting table, together with a high positive reweighting value.",
        "Moreover, the possible governors of these nouns are also entered into the table with the same reweighting value.",
        "The value controls the probability of repeating one of the nouns in a previously generated sentence or of selecting a noun which is the governor of a word in a previously generated sentence.",
        "In the latter case word repetition will occur on the next level of dependency structure, i.e., when the program selects a dependent for the selected governor.",
        "(3) The selection in b'.",

        "of phenomenon and particle, hypernyms of scattering and proton respectively, introduces semantic continuity and, in addition, reduces the redundancy and monotony of word repetition.",
        "The use of hypernyms and synonyms is implemented by entering any hypernym and synonym of the words in previous sentences into the reweighting table with a positive reweighting value, thus increasing the probability of their selection.",

        "In the present system the addition of an anaphoric dependent for a hypernym -34--automatically terminates the selection of other dependents for the hypernym.",
