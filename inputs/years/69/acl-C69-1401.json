        "Applications of,a Computer System for Transformational Grammar* by Joyce Friedman The University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Michigan, U.S.A.",
        "Writing a transformational grammar for even a fragment of a natural language is a task of a high order of complexity.",
        "Not only must the individual rules of the grammar perform as intended in isolation, but the rules must work correctly together in order to produce the desired results.",
        "The details of grammar-writing are likely to be regarded as secondary by the linguist, who is most concerned with what is in the language and how it is generated, and would generally prefer to pay less attention to formal and notational detail.",
        "It is thus natural to ask if a computer can be used to assist the linguist in developing a grammar.",
        "The model is formal; there are a large number of details to be worked out; the rules interact with one another in ways which may not be foreseen.",
        "Most of the errors which occur in writing grammars can be corrected if only they are brought to the attention of the linguist.",
        "Those which cannot be so corrected should be of even greater interest to the writer of the grammar.",
        "This research was supported in part by the United States Air Force Electronic Systems Division under Contract F19628-C-0035, and by the National Science Foundation under Grant GS-2271.",
        "A computer system which attempts to provide this assistance to the writer of a grammar is now available at both the University of Michigan and Stanford University.",
        "The system is written in Fortran IV and runs on the IEW 360/67 computer.",
        "The linguistic model embodied by the system is the theory of transformational grammar, roughly as described by Chomsky in Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.",
        "[2] The programs represent the linguistic metatheory.",
        "Grammars are accepted by the programs as data.",
        "The program handles all three components of a transformational grammar: phrase structure, lexicon, and transformations.",
        "It carries out the full process of sentence generation, including phrase structure generation, lexical insertion, and transformation.",
        "The technical details of the particular model of transformational grammar have been described elsewhere [3].",
        "This presentation will emphasize the ways in which the programs can be used, and will describe experiences in using them both in grammar writing and in teaching.",
        "An example of a grammar The notation for grammars and the use of the programs will not be described formally here, but will be illustrated by an extended example.",
        "The example consists of a small grammar and a sample derivation.",
        "Each part will be presented twice, first as initially 1 This system was designed and programmed by the author, with T. H. Bredt, R. W. Doran, T. S. Martner, and B.W.",
        "Pollack.",
        "prepared by linguists at the University of Montreal [1], and then as redone in the computer system.",
        "The grammar has been greatly reduced by selecting only those transformations which were used in the derivation of the sample sentence selected.",
        "In Figures 1 and 2 the phrase-structure rules are given in parallel, first as written by the linguists, secondly as prepared for input to the computer system.",
        "The computer form can be seen to be a linearization of the usual form, with both parentheses and curly brackets represented by parentheses.",
        "No ambiguity arises from this since the presence of a comma distinguishes the choices from the options.",
        "The only other differences are minor: the symbol \"A\" has been replaced by \"DELTA\", the sentence symbol \"P\" has been translated into English \"S\", and accents have been omitted.",
        "None of these changes is of any consequence.",
        "Figure 3 is a listing of a partial lexicon.",
        "This component is present only implicitly in the original French grammar, where the complex symbols are indicated in the base trees.",
        "The lexicon specifies first the features which are used in the grammar.",
        "The list of category features also determines the order in which lexical insertion takes place.",
        "The inherent features include some which are included in complex symbols in the lexicon, and others which are added only by transformations.",
        "Contextual features are defined in the lexicon by giving a structural analysis of the context in which the item can appear.",
        "The location in which the word may be inserted is indicated by an underline symbol.",
        "Thus, common nouns are marked +NCOM, which means that they can occur only following a determiner (DET) in a"

        "In the computer version a transformation consists of three parts, identification, structural description (SD), and structural change (SC).",

        "This includes a group number repetition parameters, keywords, etc.",
        "The structural description is similar to the linguistic form, but allows also subanalysis to any depth.",

        "In most cases a single error will cause a small part of the grammar to be read badly, but the rest of the grammar will be read in and used in whatever tests were requested.",
        "An effort was made to make the error comments as clear and explicit as possible, and to make the program continue despite input errors.",
        "Deeper errors arise when a grammar is syntactically correct, but does not correctly describe the language of which it purports to be a grammar.",
        "These errors of intent cannot be detected directly by the program, since it has no standard of comparison.",
        "The program attempts to provide enough feedback to the linguist so that he will be able to detect and investigate the errors.",
        "The information produced by the program consists of derivations which may be partially controlled by the user.",
        "Since random derivations have been found to be of relatively little interest, the system allows the user to control the sentences to be generated so that they are relevant to his current problem.",
        "(The device used for this purpose has been described in [4].)",
        "It is only in the sense of providing feedback to the user that the system can be called a \"grammar tester\"; it does not directly seek out errors in a grammar, nor does it evaluate the grammar.",

        "The grammar consists of one or more of phrase structure, lexicon, and transformations.",

        "Computer experiments in transformational grammar The system has been in use since February 1968, although not fully complete at that time.",
        "The first experiments were carried out by the designers of the system, using grammars based on material in the linguistic literature.",
        "This was done to provide test material for the programs, but, more importantly, to help ensure that the notational conventions would be adequate.",
        "A fragment of grammar from Chomsky's Aspects was used to test ideas and programs for lexical insertion.",
        "The IBM Core Grammar of Rosenbaum and Lochak [6] was used in developing and testing the transformational component.",
        "Both of these projects led to valuable teaching materials, as we shall discuss later.",
        "Aspects and Core provided us with separate examples of lexicon and transformations.",
        "There was at first no single source which contained both.",
        "A relatively formal grammar was needed, even though a final translation into the notation of the system would still of course be necessary.",
        "Elizabeth Closs Traugott's Deep and surface structure in Alfredian Prose [7 ] appeared at about that time and was the first grammar which was formalized in the notation after the",
        "fact.",
        "Considerable effort had gone into designing the notation; we were anxious to see if it would now seem natural for a grammar which was new to us.",
        "Alfred was thus the first real test for the system.",
        "As it turned out there were a few difficulties which arose because the notation had not been explained clearly enough, but the results of the run were also revealing about the grammar.",
        "One general effect which was noticed in these first few cases had continued to be striking; the need for complete precision in the statement of a grammar forces the linguist to consider problems which are important, but of which he would otherwise be unaware.",
        "Also during the spring of 1969 Barbara Hall Partee made two sets of runs with preliminary versions of a grammar of English being developed by the U.C.L.A.",
        "Air Force English Syntax Project.",
        "This grammar presented another kind of challenge to the system, because it was not based directly on the Aspects model, but incorporated some recent ideas of Fillmore.",
        "As before, these runs assisted in cleaning up the programs but were also of interest to the linguist.",
        "The major advantages from the linguistic point of view seem to have been, first, that the notational system of the computer model provided a framework in which grammars could be stated, and second, that the computer runs made it easier to detect certain errors in the grammars.",
        "In the main, these errors were not particularly subtle, and could have been caught by working over the grammar carefully.",
        "The program was also used by L. Klevansky, who wrote a grammar of Swahili for the dual purposes of testing the programs and learning the language.",
        "These early experiments are described in a report [5] which gives the grammars as well as a detailed discussion of the results of the computer runs.",
        "The form of the French grammar used in the extended example above is based on the form of the Core grammar; it was therefore easily translated into the notation of the system.",
        "Shortly after the grammar was received, a large part of it was running on the computer.",
        "Minor errors in the grammar have been found and corrected; it will now be available to students as another example of a transformational grammar.",
        "The next experiment planned using the system is a project proposed by Susumu Nagara and Donald Smith at the University of Michigan, who plan to use the system to aid in writing a grammar of Japanese.",
        "Modifications to grammars based on computer runs In almost all cases the grammars used with the system have been sufficiently complete for at least informal distribution.",
        "The programs were really designed to make it easier to write grammars, not to test completed grammars.",
        "Nonetheless, on the basis of computer runs, certain types of changes have been found to be needed in the grammars.",
        "The comments which follow are based on all the grammars; they do not all apply to any one of them.",
        "Trivial corrections The most common errors are typographical errors in transcription of the grammar.",
        "These are not errors in the grammar itself; having",
        "to deal with them is one of the prices of using the camputer.",
        "In general, these can be caught with relative ease.",
        "More than one grammar has had simple errors with respect to repetition of a transformation.",
        "Number agreement transformations are written so that they produce CAT S S S ... where CAT S is wanted.",
        "(The grammar as written calls for an infinite sequence of S's to be added.",
        "The program, more cautious, adds ten S's, then complains and goes on to the next transformation.)",
        "Transformations are often stated so that they fail to apply in all cases where it is intended they apply.",
        "For example, the structural description of PASSIVE as SD # (PRE) 3NP AUX 5V (PREP) 7NP % PREP 10P % # WHERE 3 EQ 7. fails to take into account some additional parts of the VP.",
        "The correction to SD # (PRE) 3NP AUX (HAVE EN)(BE ING) 5V (PREP) 7NP % PREP 10P % #, WHERE 3 EQ 7. will allow PASSIVE to work in the additional cases.",
        "Similarly, a NOMINAL-AGREEMENT transformation which marks subjects as +NOMIN must apply not only to pronouns which precede verbs but also to those which precede copulas.",
        "Thus the structural description SD # % 3(PRON,REL) V % # .",
        "must be replaced by SD # % 3(PRON,REL) (V,COP) % # .",
        "Interrelatedness of transformations A slightly more interesting set of problems found in the computer runs are those which arise through the interrelatedness of two or more transformations.",
        "For example, in one of the grammars there were both WH-questions and TAG-questions.",
        "It was found that the TAG transformations was (optionally) applicable to any question, so that for example TOM HAS PREFER EN WHAT GIRL HAS TOM NOT was produced.",
        "This error was easily repaired once it was detected.",
        "On the other hand, a similar problem which was not easily fixed arose with another transformation which was marked optional.",
        "Testing showed that for certain base trees the result was bad if the transformation did not apply; however, when the transformation was temporarily changed to obligatory, the grammar then failed to produce some intended sentences.",
        "The proper correction to the grammar would have required specification of the contexts in which the transformation was obligatory."
