        "()We are greatly indebted for the assistance of our col-leages Mr.L.DE BUSSCHERE, who prepared all computer programs needed in this investigation, Mr.R.EECKHOUT, who helped us with many suggestions as to the possibilities of information processing techniques and with critical remarks concerning the linguistic aspects of our problem, and - last but not least - the Direction of the MATHEMATICAL CENTRE of the University of Louvain, who put at our disposal the IBM-360 computer.",
        "The texts of group A were written by 400 francophone 18 year-old pupils in the highest classes at the 61 private secundary schools in Brussels and its suburbs.",
        "This sample represents one fifth of the total population.",
        "From every pupil we obtained two Dutch compositions, one of them a piece of homework written in November 1967, another an examination composition from December of the same year.",
        "The reasons for this choice are evident, since the pupils can call in their parents' and their dictionaries' assistance in the first situation but not in the second.",

      "text": [
        "The main purpose of this contribution is to test and verify certain non-computational insights made about language interference in general.",
        "Dutch presents a very poignant example of this phenomenon since its vocabulary contains a very large number of French loan and foreign words and there is still an \"open door\" allowing the intrusion of lexical gallicism in practically unlimited quantity.",
        "Thus the Dutch vocabulary holds a lot of parallel lexemes of both origins, e.g. analyse/ ontleding, fenomeen/verschijnsel, decep*ie/ontgoocheling etc.",
        "This situation strongly resembles that of English with its Anglo-Saxon and Romance words, although the semantic differentiation of such word-pairs seems to have progressed much more there.",
        "Whereas the native Dutch speaker plays both keys with an unbiased ease, for the Belgian francophone this ambiguous situation produces certain constraints and difficulties, which have visible effects on word-choice, growth rate of foreign words and vocabulary size in general.",
        "For reasons of simplicity our investigation did not adopt the usual distinction between loanwords and foreign words since this is based on the different degrees of integration of foreign lexemes, measured by differences in pronunciation, social acceptability within the speaking community and certain prescriptive arrangements such as their inclusion in vocabularies and dictionaries, whose authority is generally accepted.",
        "As the aim of our investigation was to find ways of providing numerical values for interference phenomena, we proceeded in a purely descriptive way, using only etymological criteria to distinguish between original and foreign lexical elements.",
        "Thus we considered units containing either lexical or morphological elements, or both, as loanwords.",
        "So bonjouren with its French lexical element was entered, but also trotseren because of its French word-fromational part.",
        "Composita containing only one foreign element (e.g. avondtoilet) were treated as loanwords unless this element had already been entered as an autonomous word.",
        "No distinction was made between foreign words 2) included in the Standard Dutch Vocabulary of van Dale ,(e.g. assaut) and those which are not mentioned there (e.g.auberge), both examples occurring in our investigation materials.",
        "Since the computer program did not provide for lemma-like items, all different morphological forms and derivations of words were regarded as different types; thus expressie, expresaief, ex",
        "pressionist etc.",
        "are counted as different items.",
        "Also for reasons of simplicity all non-French foreign words are relegated here to the category of pure Dutch items.",
        "3.",
        "Lexical interference and word-length",
        "As a first approximation test the percentage of foreign words in the vocabulary in both FWD and SWD-texts was established.",
        "The results are as follows : TOKENS TYPES logTYPES FOREIGN TYP./ogF.T.",
        "1 F.TYPES FWD 47,307 5,653 0.8375 648 0.4954 11.85 SWD 10,358 2,616 0.8807 141 0.4285 5.38 The difference of foreign vocabulary ratio in both groups results in distributional differences of words of diverging letter-number.",
        "Though the overall word-length of tokens in both groups is nearly identical (4.51 for SWD and 4.61 for FWD) an application of the chi-square test proved the divergences of word distribution (words belonging to different word-classes) to be highly significant.",
        "The average word-length of types (M) is different in both groups : M a FWD 7.85.",
        "2.97 SWD 7.03 2.72 As the pronunciation of French words is in most cases adapted to the Dutch ones (and this is reflected in the orthography), it was not plausible to suppose that this divergence was due noly to the proportional difference of foreign words.",
        "It was found that the divergence was partly due to the use of composite in FWD; their distribution differs considerably from SWD.",
        "This 5 is strikingly evident for word-length 10 (fig.2) The fact that FWD-authors would \"switch in\" this Dutch-formational device in cases where the Dutch native speaker does not, shows that francophones are \"over-aware\" of this means of translating the French genitive construction by a Dutch compositum (e.g. pot de fleurs> bloempot).",
        "This fact strengthens the assumption made in this paper, that the lexical level of language is very closely connected with higher (syntactic) levels, so that statistically statable facts may be explained only in connection with certain more general models of speech production.",
        "The interference model presented here consists of two parts : the syntactic one, containing also the word-formational devices, which may be thought of as a generative device of the kind described by N.CHOMSKY and other generativists; the second part, called the lexical morpheme store, is thought of as consisting of entries \"written down\" in terms of conceptual symbols, provided with actual linguistic interpretations.",
        "These \"interpretations\", which in a very simplified manner may be identified with words tout court, are picked out of the store and \"fitted\" into previously constructed sentence forms.",
        "In other words, we assume that the sentences are formed according to semantic requirements before the actual words have been chosen.",
        "This last routine goes on in a semi-automatic way, which may he visualized as picking the required lexemes - according to the entries in terms of conceptual symbols - out of a magnetic tape gliding under a reading device of some sort.",
        "For the case of a bilingual speaker, we can imagine the procedure as a tape with three different tracks, the middle one containing the \"entries\" , the other two the respective actual morphemes, in casu Dutch and French (0 and F in fig.3).",
        "Speaking in one of the two languages demands a switch-over to one of the external tracks.",
        "It may be assumed that, in the case of a monolingual Dutch speaker, the cells contain the parallel French and Dutch words in an unordered manner, whereas with a francophone a bias exists towards the French loanword (e.g. column 1 on fig.3 : phenomene > fenomeen (verschijnseZ)).",
        "This explains the predilection for loanwords even within the limits of the \"basic vocabulary\" and the more so with words of low frequency.",
        "Other variants of speech production behavior are possible; for instance the hyper-correct option 1 1 in column 2, where the speaker consciously reaches for the more distant lexeme, and the case of pure borrow",
        "ing, which may be conceived of as an automatic switch-over to the French side, wherever the Dutch track is blank or whenever the bilingual's competence fails to furnish a good Dutch word or synonym.",
        "In this process the French lexeme is placed in the cell on the Dutch side (cf.column 3 where 0 is the lacking word).",
        "We assume that the word-formational rules belong to the syntactical part.",
        "Thus the reshaping of new French borrowings (cf. the loan-adjective gebasaneerd composed of the French basand , whose counterpart is lacking in the Dutch track, and of two Dutch affixes ge- and -d) is done in the grammatical part of our model.",
        "As a matter of fact, this assumption is a heuristic over-simplification, because certain grammatical morphemes are in fact borrowed, cf. the endings -eren, -atie, age etc.",
        "In order to explain this phenomenon, one could argue on the fact that in many cases whole word-items are introduced to the lexical store and activate the analogy mechanism, - but this problem would lead us beyond the scope of the present investigation.",
        "5.",
        "A code-switching theory",
        "There has been much speculation about the possible principle of lexeme order in the store, some ordering being a necessary condition of efficient recoding.",
        "Much discussion, too, has 8 been devoted to the so-called ZIPF-law 3).",
        "The most convincing explanation was that suggested by HERDAN 9, namely that an ordering of items by decreasing frequency would diminish the number of operations necessary to identifie a given item.",
        "\"Let us ... assume that the arrangement of the entries is systematic according to frequency of occurence in descending order of frequency, so that the most frequent word has rank 1, the second most frequent word rank 2, and so on.",
        "If in such a dictionary, that is one in which words are arranged in order of decreasing frequency and increasing order of rank, the lookup procedure is one of successive comparison, the word of rank r will require r lookup operations, and since this word occurs - the Zipf-law assumed - C/r times, the total number of Zook-up operations required to locate a word is C (the constant in the Zipf-law, formulated as r.fr= C ).",
        "Thus for n words contained in the dictionary, nC Zook-up operations will be required.",
        "On the other hand, we know that for the Zipf-law the total number of occurences (the text length in terms of word number) and thus the total number of words to be searched, is given by",
        "It follows that the average number of Zook-up operations per word is An= nC/C logen = n/log.",
        "n (...) This compares favourably with the n/2 lookup operations which would be needed under the scheme described above, which makes no use of the frequency element.\" ) Within the framework of our model it would mean that the winding and unwinding of the tape takes considerably less time thau in the case of wholly random distribution.",
        "The question remains of what principle underlies the differentiation of item possibility.",
        "Here too, the concept of \"pigeon-holing\" of semantic information proposed by HERDAN 4), seems to be the most plausible.",
        "9 In other words, the \"conceptual symbols\" do not represent separate pieces of the univers de discours taken at random, but are probably ordered by some classificational system, resembling the biological classification."

        "To test this hypothesis we divided the FWD material into three frequency-classes (group I: absolute frequency 1, group II: frequency 2 and 3, group III : frequency above 3) and examined the samples of these groups according to their distribution within the classificational system applied by L.BROUWERS in his Dutch thesaurus HET JUISTE 5) WOORD .",
        "The supposition was that in the event of ordering of some kind, the distribution of items among the \"content classes\" in the thesaurus (expressed as entropy and redundancy) would be different for various frequency groups, and further, that in the event of the \"pigeon-holing\" suggested by HERDAN, the redundancy should increase for groups of items with higher frequencies.",
        "Such an increase was in fact observed, as the reader can conclude from the following table:",
        "Thus it seems that some \"natural order\", reflecting a classification of concepts according to their content, is at least one of the causes differentiating the relative frequencies of words.",

        "a) The francophone bilinguals use more than twice as much words as the monolingual native speakers of Dutch.",

        "log N ' c) It can nevertheless be described as \"normal\" since the value of parameter B in MANDELBROT's formulation of the ZIPF-law is 1.03347. d) The foreign lexemes are not equidistributed in the assumed word store; their number increases with the growing text length and this increase is quite evident above the first 3,000 words.",
        "This fact allows one to think of them as a \"basic vocabulary\", covering various subjects (two different multi-subject samples gave nearly identical values of the basic vocabulary).",
        "e) The existence of the basic vocabulary and the good fit of empirical data with the theoretical distribution known as ZIPF-law, strengthens the assumption that the word-units in the store are ordered.",
        "f) One of the ordering principles is the pigeon-holing of information according to some classificational system which takes into account the informational content of words."
