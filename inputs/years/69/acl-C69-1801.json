        "This paper discusses the feasibility of applying a model of language use based on a modification and extension (to be discussed below) of the generative semantic (transformational) theory of language competence recently developed by Paul Postal, George Lakoff, John Robert Ross, games D. McCawley, and others, to problems of computational linguistics.",
        "The theory of generative semantics, to be discussed in section II, is an outgrowth, of, and reaction to, Chomsky's 1965 theory of transformational linguistics.",
        "It is a radical theory which deals with a very great range of problems with very abstract methods.",
        "Tnose working in this paradigm hold that there is a linguistic level reflecting conceptual or semantic structure which is directly convertible into surface syntax by a single set of garden-variety transformations, with no significant intermediary level, that is, no \"deep structure\".",
        "Those of us working in generative semantics believe that methods substantially those long familiar in linguistics can achieve very absract, very general results which treat semantcs in a more serious and enlightening way than ever before.",
        "I do not, I think, support this very strong claim very well in section II, but I provide summaries of several studies and a lengthy bibliogrpahy of works which when consulted will hopefully give some feeling for what is being attempted, I think not without results.",
        "But generative semantics is a model, or rather, a theory, of competence, like most serious theories of language now held to by American linguists.",
        "even if, as might be claimed, our semantic structures are to be merely variants of the structures long familiar from forma logic, so that if our assumptions are correct, we will ultimately be able to directly transform surface structures into underlying semantic structures, the majority of actual sentences, as well as all hyper-sentential structures, the treatment of which has been swept under the rug of \"performance\", will remain unhandle-able.",
        "Accordingly, I propose initially certain extensions and modifications of the theory to make it in some sense",
        "1-2 a model of performance.",
        "But if we are to apply it to the computer, a major component must still be added.",
        "The impetus to this application is bhe possibility of creating an understanding machine, described in section IV below.",
        "Since the actual human interpretation of language depends on past knowledge (consider which of these sentences is good and why: As for Albuquerque, the 3iffel Tower is pretty.",
        "As for Paris, the Eiffel Tower is pretty.",
        "And these: Shirley is a blonde and Susan is Nordic-looking too.",
        "Shirley is a linguist and Susan is Nordic-lloking too.)",
        "the old split between semantics, syntax, and pragmatics must be revised, and our model closely linked with a memory and possibly a logic component as well.",
        "Obviously this defines a very difficult task, but inaofar as such goals as MT, artificial intelligence, and machine reading of handwritten material or writing of spoken material involve comprehension on the part of the machine, of which there seems to be no doubt, these important goals will continue to elude us until such time as we can devise such an understanding machine as I have described below.",
        "believe that generative semantics lays the foundation for studies relevant to such a development, and it is in this context that my proposals are made.",
        "In section II I will discuss generative semantics.",
        "In section III I will discuss the body of my proposals here.",
        "In section IV I will discuss what should be required of a generalized \"understanding\" machine.",
        "Part The theory of Generative Semantics.",
        "The theory of generative semantics is an outgrowth and reaction to the theory of transformational grammar as represented in Chomsky's 1965 book, Aspects of the Theory of Syntax (MIT Press).",
        "To a very large extent, this theory has been the development of a small group of former students of Chomsky's or their close colleagues.",
        "John (Raj) Ross has said that the theory is really just an attempt to explicate Paul Postal's work of five years ago to date.",
        "If Postal was the founder of this school, if you can call it that, its main workers have been Raj Ross and George Lakoff, who between 1965 and 1968 swept aside most of transformational linguistics as it then was.",
        "But perhaps best known of the group is James McCawley, who graduated from MIT in 1965 with a Ph.D. based on work in Phonology, not syntax or semantics.",
        "He promptly amazed Lakoff and Ross by some very substantive work in the latter areas as well as phonology.",
        "As a student of MoCawley's I will be emphasizing his contributions here, and those of my colleagues at Chicago, Jerry L. Morgan and Georgia M. Green, but it should be kept in mind that people like Ross, Lakoff, Postal, Arnold Zwicky, David Perlmutter, min Bach, Robin Lakoff, and several others, have made the current theory possible, and that many others, such as Robert Wall, Lauri Kartunnen, Ronald Langacker, and others, have contributed as well.",
        "It should also be kept in mind that the Case Grammar of Fillmore and the work done by Gruber, while differing from generative semantics, have contributed a great deal to it.",
        "The basic theory of generative semantics is built upon an attempt to relate the underlying semantic structure of language to the surface, phonetic manifestation of that underlying structure.",
        "That is, a phonetic reality is recognized, and a semantic reality is recognized.",
        "But unlike other versions of transformational grammar, this theory assigns no special status to syntax; syntax is subsumed in the semantics.",
        "McCawley has jokingly referred to his theory as being one of either \"semantax\" or .",
        "\"semantics\".",
        "The name generative semantics is not a particularly good one, since it implies that the goal of the theory is, as with the work of Chomsky, to \"separate the grammatical sequences\" of a language\"from the ungrammatical sequences.'",
        "(Chomsky, Syntactic Structures, la.",
        "In",
        "11-2 other words, to generate all and only grammatical sentences of a language.",
        "This is not at all the goal of generative semantics.",
        "Rather, what we want to do is in some rigorous way specify the correlations of under-kying semantic entities and surface phonetic entities: to specify for any underlying semantic structure what its possible phonetic realizations in some language are, and for some phonetic structure what underlying semantic structures it can represent.",
        "Naturally, some descriptive ability is predicated as well, that is, we want to be able to define ambiguity in some algorittrmic fashion, we want to be able to define levels or classes of ill-correlation between structures on different levels, etc.",
        "Ohomsky would say that a sentenceslike \"Golf plays John\" is eminently deserving of a star; we would say",
        "(1) if it's supposed to mean'John plays golf', it doesn't succeed in conveying the message; (2) if it's supposed to mean 'John loves Marsha', then it's really bad; and (3) if Golf is a man's name and John the name of a",
        "game or role, it's a good sentence --- indeed, one can very well imagine arcane circumstances under which one might utter that sentence with the intent of saying that the game plays John, that the tail wags the dog, as it were.",
        "Suppose, for example, that John's wife were tired of him spending all his free time playing golf and she grumbled to a beighbor about it, and the neighbor rather unfeelingly replied, \"Oh well, John plays golf.\" I can very well imagine John's wife complaining bitterly,\"Oh no, golf plays John.\" In any case, it is for hus unimaginative approach to language that Chomsky has been jokingly called a \"bourgeois formalist\".",
        "Even when we use stars, we try to keep in mind that just about any valid phonological string of a language conveys one or more meanings in some context, and that it is artificial to take a string out of context and declare it good or bad.",
        "So \"generative semantics\" is a bad name.",
        "The following diagram of the components of the theory is based on McCawley's paper in the proceedings of the 4th Regional Meeting of the Chicago Linguistic Society (1968).",
        "A theory very similar is discussed in Ronald Langacker's book Language and its Structure (Harbrace, 1968)s PP.",
        "114-34.",
        "The above diagram comes from a report prepared by myself, Jerry Morgan, and Georgia Green, called the Camelot Report, which attempted to describe the current–fate of transformational research in the Summer of 1968, particularly in reference to the LSA Summer Linguistic Institute at the University of Illinois, where Haj Ross, George Lakoff, and Jim McCawley had lectured to large groups on a huge number of very \"hairy\" (i.e., difficult and tickleishly novel) topics.",
        "In that report (which was prepared for Victor Yngve), We raised several, questions concerning the above representation.",
        "We asked:",
        "1.",
        "What will an adequate semantic representation have to include?",
        "What form will it have?",
        "2.",
        "What can a transformation do?",
        "What does one look like?",
        "stage 3.",
        "At what and in what manner are semantic represdAtatione converted into words of real languages?",
        "These were by no means all of the questions asked.",
        "Needless to say, the answering of these questions has hardly begun and will undoubtedly guarantee linguists a few good centuries of work at least.",
        "It is only in the last decade that syntax has been the subject of serious work, and we are still only discovering how ignorant we are.",
        "Semantics is even newer, less than a decade old.",
        "If anyone doubts that this is true, consider a) what the above 3 questions would have meant to a linguist in (say) 1955, and b)why he would have been wrong, in his (lack of) comprehension of them.",
        "One of the great contributions of Postal and Ross has been",
        "their constant critical look at transformational grammar.",
        "One of the things they saw was that our transforma#ions were (and are) extremely powerful devices, with practically no constraints placed on their formulation.",
        "What I will do here is summarize some of the attempts at partial answers to the three above questions.",
        "In this way I can delimit and explicate generative semantics best.",
        "I will start by abstracting parts of two papers by McCawley that deal with the nature of semantic representation.",
        "In a paper in the Japanese journal Kotoba no Uchu (World of Language) in 1967, McCawley argued that semantic representation would be similar to syntactic representation as familiar from Aspects-type grammar, but that it would also be quite similar to symbolic logic as familiar from the tons of work that have followed Principia and such studies.",
        "That semantic representation should resemble syntactic representation makes sense if only because we are arguing for a single set of rules that transforms (i.e., relates) the underlying structure into (to) the surface structures.",
        "There will be more about that later.",
        "McCawley argues as follows: the following devices have all had a role in symbolic logic:",
        "1. propositional connectives: 'and', 'or', 'not'.",
        "2, constants denoting individuals.",
        "3. predicates, denoting properties and relationships.",
        "4. set symbols and the quantifiers 'all' and 'there exists'.",
        "5. descriptions of sets and individuals.",
        "itx The following devices play a role in natural languages: 1. all lgs.",
        "have words for 'and', 'or', and 'not'.",
        "(he notes however that these words in natural lgs.",
        "may connect more than sentences) - 2.",
        "\"indices\" denoting individuals; John loves John eight be represented as xi loves x2, but John loves",
        "II-5 himself is xi loves xi.",
        "3. predicates are expressed in natural lgs.",
        "(by verbs, adjectives, nouns, etc.)",
        "expressions such as 4.",
        "\"Words such as all andlot least one are two members of a rather large arge class of expressions which are used to indicate not only the existence of an individual or a set but the absolute or relative number of members in that set.\" 5. sets and individuals can be expressed as descriptions using modified noun phrases.",
        ".McCawley then gives further reasons for supposing symbolic logic representation to be proper for semantic representation.",
        "(See the bibliography to this section where this and other papers that can be consulted for these arguments in detail are listed.)",
        "In a paper prepared for the symposium on \"Cognitive Studies and Artificial Intelligence Research\" hold by the Wenner-Oren Fbundation at the University of Chicago in March of this year, McCawley discussed semantic representation at length.",
        "Some of what he had to say there should be noted.",
        "He claimed, \"semantic representation must indicate the immediate constituent structure of the elements involved in it (i.e. examples showing that different meanings can consist of the same semantic elements combined in different waysEare easy to come be\" (p.1) He gave the example of John doesn't beat his wife because he loves her.",
        "If the negation applies to John beats his wife, the sentence means 'the reason tat John doesn't beat his wife is that he loves her', whereas if it applies to the John beats his wife because he loves her., the mg. is 'the reason that Johnn-beats his wife Ts – not Mat he loves her.'",
        "Notice that here a surface form represents at least two different underlying structures which nonetheless contain precisely the same semantic elements grouped differently, however.",
        "Another point made is that \"semantic representations must include .., some indication of presupposed coref-erence.\" (p.2) That is, the following, sentencein neutral (4.e.",
        "null) context is ambiguous three-ways:",
        "II-6 John told Harry that his wife was pretty.",
        "Whose wife?",
        "John's?",
        "Harry's?",
        "or a third's?",
        "It could be any.",
        "However, if we know who his refers to, there is no such ambiguity.",
        "This may seem trivial, but it is a point often ignored.",
        "McCawley then gives an argument for referential indices being different from expressions used to describe.",
        "The sentence Max debied that he kissed the girl be kissed.",
        "is not contradictory if \"the girl he kissed\"- is the speaker's description.",
        "Another notion is that of presupposed set members ship.",
        "Ih Maxis more intelligent than most Americans.",
        "said with primary stress do most, the sentence is good if and only if Maxis presupposed to be American, that is, the sentence implies Maxis American.",
        "With primary stress on Americans, however, Maxis presupposed not to be American.",
        "Presupposition is in general a very hairy topic which was recently the subject of an entire conference (at the Ohio State University).",
        "We know very little about the nuamces of implication and are only beginning even to identify the problems.",
        "But if a machine is ever to read Catcher id the Rye catching all the nuances of the italicized wor.s, we had better find out how stress is used to alter the presupposition-al set of a sentence.",
        "I need not be so unsubtle as to suggest the extreme value of such researches to psychology.",
        "Perhaps they already know about all this, for all I know.",
        "In any case I cannot restrain myself from including MoCawley's beautiful example CIA Agents are more stupid than most Americans.",
        "He had primary stress on the most, but I prefer to think of it as going on the Americans.",
        "I would like #o interject at this point a minor apology.",
        "I have been rather fan-clubish here and have waved my hand a lot.",
        "Frankly I see no value",

        "Let me also note, lest I seem unduly credulous towards the thoughts of Chairman Quang [mild-mannered linguist J. D. McCawley is in reality Q. F.

        "In the Kotoba no Uchu paper McCawley noted the following differences:",
        "1.",
        "\"It is necessary to admit predicates which assert properties not only of individuals but also of sets and propositions.\" 2.",
        "\"In mathematics one enumerates certain objects which [onewill talk about, defines other objects in terms a these objects, and cgrifines[oneseld to a discussion of objects whichlone3 has either postulated or defined....",
        "However, one does not begin a conversation by giving a list of postulates and definitions.",
        ".... ...people often talk about things which either do not exist or",
        "which they have identified incorrectly.",
        "Indices exist in the minds of the speaker rather than in the real world; they are conceptual entities which the individual speaker creates in interpreting his experience.\" In the Wenner-Gran symposium, McCawley had more to say about the difference between logic and language.",
        "1.",
        "Immediate constituent structure (trees) rather than parentheses are basic.",
        "First, \"semantic representations are to form the input to a system of transformations that relate meaning to superficial form; to the 9",
        "11-8 extent that these transforma#ions have been formulated and justified, they appear to be stateable only in terms of constituent structure and constituent type, rather than in terms of configurations of parentheses and terminal symbols.\" Secondly, \"it may be necessary to operate in terms of semantic representations in which symbols have no left-to-right ordering....\"",

        "\"The range of indices will have to be enormous.",

        "To clarify the relationship of semantic to syntactic representations let me quote here from McCawley's Kotoba no Uchu paper: Since the rules for combining items into larger units in sybbolic logic formulas must be stated in terms of categories such as 'preposition', 'predicate', and 'index,* these categories can be regarded as labels on the nodes of these trees.",
        "And since these categories all appear to correspond to syntactic categories, the same symbols (S, V, NP, etc.)",
        "may be used as node labels in semantic representations as are used in syntactic representations.",
        "Accordingly, semantic representations appear to be extremely close in formal nature to syntactic representations, so close in fact that it becomes possible to catalogue the conceivable formal differences and determine whether those differences are real or apparent.",

        "Gruber intended to \"show various consistently recurrent semantic relationships among parts of the sentence and among different sentences, which can best be explained by the existence of some underlying pattern of which the syntactic structure is a particular manifestation.\" (p.1) He concluded that \"a level at which semantic interpretation will be relevant will be deeper than the level of 'deep structure' in syntax.\" (p.2) Later Lakoff showed evicence that in fact the level of semantic interpretation was that of deep structure, but argued that (as Gruber said) \"syntax and semantics will have the same representation at the prelexical level\"(p. 3): a single set of rules would transform semantic structures containing no lexical items into surface syntactic representations containing them.",
        "The study of lexical, insertion, the process by which the underlying semantic elements are grouped into units replaceable by surface lexical items has led to a large literature containing a great many questions, and some positive answers.",
        "An important paper was McCawley's 1968 paper, \"Lexical insertion in a transformational grammar without deep structure.\" There he started by assuming various points concluded in other papers of his.",

        "In semantic representation, only indices and 'predicates' ate terminal node labels.... McCawley then defined 'dictionary entry' as a transformation which replaced part of a tree by a surface lexical item.",
        "He expressed doubt these rules could be ordered internally or external, since it would hardly be possible, for example, that some question would arise as to the relative ordering of the transformation introducing the word horse and that extraposing NP's in two dialects, that is, the ordering could not possibly matter.",
        "He then raised several possibilities as to the relative ordering of the lexical rules vts-a-vis other rules.",
        "Are the lexical rules last, first, or where?",
        "McCawley argued for the lexical rules applying just before the post-cyclic rules, and adduced evidence for several rules, predicate-raising, equi-NP deletion, etc., being pre-lexical.",
        "In his 1968 LSA paper, Jerry L. Morgan of the UOiversity of Chicago added to this.",
        "He pointed out \"the rather strong assumption that lexical_items only 'replace' constituents.\" (p.3) He wrote, \"the process of syntactic derivation begins with semantic representation in terms of trees containing very highly abstract semantic terms, operating upon this by means of rules permuting, deleting, and collapsing parts of the representation, finally deriving a structure whose constituents are replaced by lexical items.\" (p. 3) He then skated a very strong claim of the theory: Given the set of universal pre-lexical rules, the set of universal semantic primitives, and the set of universal constraints on the operation of rules, such as those described by Ross 1967, these define the universal set of possible lexical items in their semantic aspect; that is, they rule out as impossible an infinittE classof a priori possible \"meanings\" a lexical item could have.",
        "(P.4) 16 11715 A second very strong claim of the theory is: Insofar as the selection from, and details of implementation of, the universal set of rules is language-specific, the idiosyncracies of a given language in this respect will also be reflected by systematic gaps in the lexicon.",
        "The same is true for the set of semantic primitives and the set of constraints on rules.",
        ".... (p.4-5)",
        "Morgan came up with some restrictions on lexical items: only 1) \"lexical items Kan replace a constituent which is not labelled S.\" (p.6) 2) \"verbs cannot incorporate referential indives.\"(p.6)",
        "One fi...,Lher point to be made is that lexical items can only replace well-formed subtrees.",
        "My own work has been concerned with specifying classes of possible lexical items and accounting for the syntactic properties of verbs in terms of their semantics, thereby attempting to capture the intuition long familiar from traditional grammar that certain Lemantic classes of verbs, such as \"verbs of giving and taking\" or \"verbs of motion\" also form syntactic classes and hence their syntactic properties can be regarded as derived from their semantics.",
        "Georgia Green of the University of Chicago has presented a paper (1969) which is also interesting in terms of lexical insertion.",
        "She tends to regard lexical insertion ks fairly divorced from morphology, and views lexical insertion as the replacement of an entire sub-tree by a surface lexical item which may contain more than one morpheme as classically defined.",
        "This position is somewhat different from my own, as I regard lexical insertion as primarily involving the replacement of items on a 1-1 basis.",
        "However, this is an empirical question and only future research will decide which of us is more nearly correct.",

        "McCawley called for a theory of \"implicational relations\", since in cases such as the ambiguity of warm the ambiguity is not a property of the item itself but of a class of items, and therefore such an ambiguity must be specified in terms of general principles.",
        "McCawley was not clear about the nature of these implicational r.:lations, so that the nature of the relationship of the various sads was more or less left open.",
        "I have discussed the noon of systematic ambiguity, where the ambiguities of an entire class of verbs is specified in terms of the derivational process underlying them all, not just in terms of a descriptive statement.",
        "Thus we are seeking to explain lexical gaps in terms of statements such as \"The reason some language L lacks a verb V glossing the verb W in the language M is that M, but not L, has the transformation T.\" Anyone familiar with the lexicons of French, English, and German, for example, knows that there are certain kinds of verb which are not typical of one or another of these languages which nonetheless readily occur in the others.",
        "Such verbs are derived by processes occuring in one but not another language, and our task is to discover and describe such processes.",

        "I have not really attempted to provide even an elementary guide to the methods of generative semantics or to its conclusions, its findings, but I hope I have explicated somewhat its goals and given some insight into the direction in which it is moving.",
        "Some very strong claims are forthcoming on the nature of grammars and languages and hence of language itself.",
        "A tremendous amount of work needs to be done, but one can see clearly that one possible end point of this work will be a very comprehensive, very strong theory of language competence that has a great deal to say about human beings.",
        "One perhaps minor point, though, looms up large here: generative semantics relates semantic structures to surface sentences by a single let of miles.",
        "There are s,veral versions of transformational grammar that do this, but generative semantics is perhaps the most-developed of these.",

        "Suppose I know that Richard Daley is the mayor of Chicago, and I read in a Chicago newspaper that the Mayor of Chicago is the greatest man in the world.",
        "The LSD must somehow be so stored that I can retrieve from my memory the fact that Richard Daley is thought to be the greatest man in the world by that newspaper.",
        "This raises .",
        "-.",
        "the question of how to convert underlying semantic trees into subnets of the semantic network of which memory probably consists.",
        "hang of the features incorporated into .",
        ", Sidney Lambts conceptual networks will, I think, be incorporatable into the moddl.",
        "In particular, all occurences of a particular entity (concept) will have to be linked in some way or identified.",
        "In a sense info grabbing starts by analyzing the LSD into semantic structures, and ends by synthesizing these structures and those already in memory into a new memory network.",
        "One point that should be made clear is that all information will have to be represented on the same level.",
        "That is, both the program and the data will reside in the same memory net, as in a computer.",
        "Reading an algorithm in a book, the machine will store this in its memory just as it stores part of its own program, and it will be able to either quote the algorithm later as linguistic material as part of info retrieval, or use that algorithm as part of its own logical operations.",
        "There is some question tho as to whether this quite ideal machine could actually function in this way.",
        "But human beings are like this in some ways, and it is part of their language capability that they should or could.",
        "The process of info spewing is a reverse of'the info grab.",
        "The logic component will initiate the spew, using part of the memory net and selecting one or more underlying trees to spew out.",
        "It will then",
        "IV-5 go through the derivational process and ultimately generate an actual string of sentences.",
        "Perhaps feedback will enter here, so that the machine can utilize part of its own spewings as imthediate LSD, although it is hard to see why the machine would need to do so, altho humans are constantly correcting themselves mid-sentence.",
        "An obvious question is what the role of generative semantics in all this.",
        "I think the experience of CL has been Ink in general that ad hoc programs don't work.",
        "We need a basic linguistic theory.",
        "I think generative semantics is the best bet.",
        "But as I noted, it is a theory of cometence.",
        "We will need to modify it.",
        "I think we need to",
        "1) admit rules of non-recoverable deletion, 2) admit rules for hypersentential constructs, and 3) build strong interactions with legit and memory components.",
        "In particular, the relationship of underlying semantic structures to conceptual networks will have to he investigated in depth.",
        "If the hypotheses of the GS linguists are correct, then we have a simple but powerful basis for programs directly transforming language source materials into semantic information usuable by programs.",
        "For example, if the semantic structures turn out to be universal, they can serve as a pivot or intermediary for the currently out of fashion goal of MT."
