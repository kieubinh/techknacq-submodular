        "Total or Selected Content Analysis' Julius Laffal Connecticut Valley Hospital, laddletown, Conn.",
        "The core of any system of content analysis is a dictionary specifying the content categories to be assigned to verbal units.",
        "The system described in this paper utilizes a category dictionary in which all the common words of English are classified into one or two of 116 possible categories.",
        "The associated computer method is at present capable of analyzing a text of 25,000 words in about 20 minutes of machine time, outputting a distribution of frequency of occurrence of the 116 content categories.",
        "Up to 15 separate texts may be analyzed at the same time, or the productions of 15 speakers, mixed in any way, as long as each segment is identified with the appropriate source.",
        "The computer analysis program will be discussed briefly, as will some of the considerations which went into the construction of the dictionary.",
        "An illustration of the analysis of textual material will be presented, and two studies applying the procedure will be described."

        "2.",
        "Two of the categories (no score and hand-score) are not actually content categories.",
        "2 eliminates a number of functions words (articles, most conjunctions, auxiliary verbs such as bp be and to have), changes all verb forms into the present infinitive form, and reduces plural noun forms to the singular.",
        "These editing changes are required because the dictionary contains only the root forms of the word.",
        "Illustrations 3 and 5 show a text and its edited form.",
        "Ultimately, as the dictionary expends to include common forms, many of these editing requirements will be reduced.",
        "There are 20,000 root forms in the dictionary at present.",
        "The editing procedure reduces an original text by between 15% and 20%: a 25,000 edited text would originally have consisted of around 40,000 words.",
        "The computer analysis is directed solely to content, and does not take grammatical form into account.",
        "The analysis thus shows what is being talked about, but provides no information that the grammar ordinarily conveys.",
        "It may show that aggression is a major theme of a text, but will not show who is aggressing against whom.",
        "The researcher may choose to analyze for total content, as represented by the 116 categories, or specify a limited number of content categories, in which case the program will disregard all other categories.",
        "The program is at present written in Fortran IV and MAP languages (ultimately to be entirely in Fortran IV).",

        "This approach is inadequate if one wishes to deal with all of the content of the sample.",
        "There are certain empirical bases for developing a conceptional system which will deal with all possible contents.",

        "The number of separate domains of meaning each occupied by a few synonyms is extremely large.",
        "As a step toward reduction one may group words similar in meaning, even if not synonymous.",
        "Words like walk, run, ride, and go readily group together as sharing a common meaning.",
        "Application of the criterion of similarity along with that of synonymy leads to broader and more inclusive clusters of words.",
        "A further reduction in the number of clusters or domains of meaning may be effected by applying an additional criterion for grouping words: that of relatedness.",

        "As the system grows, changes are more likely to occur because two existing categories are seen to border too closely on each other and to require redefinition of their boundaries and differences, rather than because new categories are discovered.",
        "A primary consideration in construction of the present conceptual dictionary was that the scheme of language had to provide an adequate basis, at the very least, for discriminating the language of one speaker from another.",
        "This meant that each entity in the scheme had to contribute to such potential.",
        "In practice this militated against units which were heavily loaded with tokens from everyone's speech and against units which rarely contributed a token to anyone's speech.",
        "Such global categories as \"nature,\" \"man,\" \"animate\" and \"inanimate\" provide very little basis for discriminating between the word predilections of separate speakers, since they inevitably contribute large numbers of tokens to everyone's speech.",
        "Relatively simple criteria for the acceptability of a category in the overall scheme were (1) that it not draw too many or too few tokens, and (2) that it contribute to discriminating between separate speakers.",
        "Where, in the present scheme, a category turned out to be large by these criteria, what was also readily apparent was some basis for splitting the category along one or more lines to produce separate categories.",

        "The area of hostility and aggression was",
        "one which required subdivision along lines which differentiated violence, anger, and simple disagreement.",
        "The area of sex, in which at the outset a discrimination was provided between heterosexual and homosexual, ended by becoming a single area, since very few references occur to homosexuality as such as opposed to sexuality in general.",
        "One other criterion which was applied is related to well known ideas of reliability and validity.",
        "The domains of reference in a scheme of language must be sufficiently discriminable from each other so that separate judges considering a word will be in agreement as to which categories are involved.",
        "If the domains of meaning are too closely related, this will be a difficult judgment and an unreliable one.",
        "To the extent that it is unreliable, its validity and its pertinence to other behavior, will be dubious.",
        "Distinctiveness of a domain of reference in a dictionary scheme is therefore an important desideratum.",

        "The four sciences which Roe had studied were Social Science, Biology, Experimental Physics, and Theoretical Physics.",
        "Eased on a series of projective tests and interviews with scientists in these fields, as well as their self-reports of problem solving activities and typical modes of thinking about problems, she concluded that Social Scientists and Theoretical Physicists were verbal imagists, while Biologists and Experimental Physicists were visual imagists.",
        "Verbal imagery is think7 ing'in words or talking to oneself, while visual imagery is thinking in pictures.",
        "In our study, we selected three outstanding:living scientists from each of these four disciplines, the Social Seiences being represented by Anthropologists.",
        "For each scientist one representative book was chosen from his technical publications addressed to colleagues, and one from his popular writings for the laity.",
        "The key words science, scientist, Biology, Anthropology, and Physics were used to identify contexts for comparison.",
        "A context included the sentence containing the key word, the preceding sentence, and the subsequent sentence.",
        "In 26 addition to the books of the scientists, an Anthropology, a Biology and a Physics textbook of,this time were also selected.",
        "The content of the textbooks was sampled by taking three sentences alternately from the top, middle and bottom of every other page, without regard to any key words.",
        "The writings of the various scientists, and in the texts, were analysed by the computer program described, and content category profiles were obtained.",
        "These profiles were then correlated with each other and factor analyzed.",

        "Highly represented on the first factor were all of the Anthropological writings, and the writings of the Theoretical Physicists.",
        "Since these two groups together constitute what Roe had called the verbal scientists, the first factor could be considered a verbal factor.",
        "The actual content which was stressed in the writings of these scientists, however, evokes more the idea of a \"humanistic\" factor, since the particular categories contributing most importantly to the factor are REASON 1 (knowledge and thinking), GROUP, HELP, and GOOD.",
        "Thus, the content analysis tells us that what manifests itself as a highly developed verbal communicative skill, also reflects a concern with h-xman affairs and human issues.",
        "Since language is par excellence the social skill, it is natural that those who use it best would also be those whose attention is directed toward the human condition.",
        "The second factor was clearly related to Physics, the writings of the Theoretical and Applied Physicists loading highest on it.",
        "The categories which contributed most to this factor were: REASON 3 27 (science), MATERIAL, REASON 1 (knowledge and thinking) and SOME.",
        "Other categories which were stressed were ESSENTIAL and TIME 1 (general time).",
        "The third factor was clearly a biological factor, since the biological writings loaded highest on it.",
        "The categories of greatest importance were: FUNCTION (bodily functions), BEGIN CHANGE, MATERIAL and FORWARD.",
        "To be noted is that no \"visual\" factor as such appeared in the analysis.",
        "This suggests that the contrast which had been drawn by Roe between \"verbal\" and \"visual\" may actually be a contrast between those with a central humanistic concern inclined to be strongly verbal in their thinking, and those who do not have this same central interest, who are more likely to stress non-verbal processes in their thinking.",
        "The method of total content analysis which I have described is applicable to many language content problems.",
        "Beside the applications described in the present paper, the technique has been used in studies of the symbolism of key words in the language of a psychotic patient (Laffal, 1960); changes in the language of a patient in treatment (Laffal, 1961); comparison of the language of therapists in talking about different patients (Watson & Laffal, 1963); comparisons of the content given by subjects in single word association, continuous word association, and free speech in response to the same stimulus word (Laffal & Feldman, 1962, 1963); comparison of the language of two and three speakers in conversations about a variety of topics (Laffal, 1967).",
        "In broadest terms the method may be applied to comparison of one individual with himself (for example, over time); one individual with 28 another; a group with itself or with other groups; the contexts surrounding one topic with those surrounding some other topic.",
        "The unique contribution which it makes is in the use of a category dictionary which classifies all the common words of English into one or two content categories, so permitting rapid display either of all the content or of selected contents, in a text."
