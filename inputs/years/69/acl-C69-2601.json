        "As far as the present writer is aware, the Yugoslav Serbo-Croat/English Contrastive Analysis Project is the first contrastive analysis effort to use a large corpus of parallel texts.",
        "The corpus is made up of the Brown Corpus (reduced by 50%) with its Serbo-Croat translation, and a smaller Control Corpus (Serbo-Croat originals and English translation).",
        "A total, thus, of twice 500,000 words plus twice 150,000 words, or a grand total of some 1,300,000 words of running text.",
        "0.2.",
        "The Project, let us make it clear, is not exclusively based on this corpus.",
        "Compilation and confrontation of grammatical statements by various authors, plus plain old intuition, figure prominently in the methodology.",
        "The insistence on a large corpus, however, is due to the conviction, prevailing among the Project workers, that only an extensive investigation of correspondences (original-language elements and their translations) can adequately reveal the less predictable patterns which tend to have a considerable contrastive analysis potential.",
        "0.21.",
        "The most productive method of obtaining correspondences from our corpus is to concordance separately its Serbo-Croat and English parts, then to merge the resulting KWIC concordances into a contrastive KWIC concordance (with English keywords and alternating English and Serbo-Croat lines).",
        "For the more promising patterns, the merging procedure will be used twice, with both English and Serbo-Croat keywords.",
        "0.22.",
        "In view of the size of the corpus, and the extensive concordancing required as a major procedure in the Project, the need for computer processing is obvious.",
        "It requires no undue strain on imagination to realize the soul-numbing effect of sheer physical handling of this mass of text if written out on slips.",
        "Even in its most efficient and flexible form of a manual concordance (a sentence-slip file with keywords underlined monolingually), without which no manual pairing Df correspondences is possible, the manual handling of this 1,300,000-word corpus calls for a staggering amount Df time and effort to prepare.",
        "According to our careful estimate, a total of 7,100 man-hours is required to make such a concordance (without the 1,900 hours of translation from English to Serbo-Croat, and vice versa).",
        "J.23.",
        "The slip file thus obtained would, however, secure )nly a one-way approach: either from English or Serbo-;roat.",
        "A slip-file allowing a two-way approach would re-luire an additional effort of at least 4,500 man-hours.",
        "J.24.",
        "Finally, even these two manual concordances would still leave unfilled the need for reverse concordancing, so important for morphosyntactic research.",
        "To meet this teed, two additional (though less ample) slip files would Nave to be established.",

        "The tape with the full text of the Brown Corpus (purchased from Brown Uni-✓ersity, -2rovidence, R.I., which had been pre?ared on an IBM 7090 machine, had first to be converted from the density of 800 BPI to 1,600 BPI, required by the Zagreb computer.",
        "1.11.",
        "After this, a printout of the entire text was obtained on the Zagreb machine.",
        "The printing took about eight hours, with a special program3restructuring the Driginal format of the Brown Corpus text.",
        "This program Left out the location-marker column on the right-hand mar-;in of printout4, and added a sequence of sentence numbers (from 00001 to 52533) on the left.",
        "L.12.",
        "The full text of the Brown Corpus was now reduced y 50/, retaining, however, as closely as possible, the same proportions of the 15 genres (styles) contained in the Corpus.",
        "L.13.",
        "Printouts of the samples retained in this reduced ✓ersion were then sent out to reliable translators, se-Lected to be representative of the three major regional ✓ariants of Serbo-Croat (western, central and eastern).",

        "Using the same tape, we now plan to produce a reverse KWIC concordance of the Serbo-Croat text.",
        "This concordance will be selective in the same sense that the English reverse concordance was (cf.",
        "Stage 4).",
        "1.9, Sta,4e 9.",
        "With the normal and reverse KWIC concordances of both the English and Serbo-Croat corpora now ob-tainedt, we can move on to the final stage(s) of central importance to the Project, i.e. the merging of these monolingual to get contrastive concordances (cf. We have planned four such concordances, and have --tem::ted to illustrate them here by short simulated sam-les.",
        "As at the time of writing this no concordances of the 3rown Corpus text (either original or translation) were available, the text used for these samples is the :;erbo-Croat original and its translation into English of the novel Povratak Filipa Latinovicza (The Return of Latinovicz) by the contemporary Croat writer Miro-E:lav Krleia.",

        "They were not to split the English sentence into two or more Serbo-Croat sentences, nor were they allowed to combine two or more English sentences into one Serbo-Croat sentence.",
        "The reason for this was the need to secure a mechanical pairing of the English (or Serbo-Croat) keyword, marked by its sentence number, with the same-numbered, parallel, Serbo-Croat (or English) sentence in the two-language concordancing planned for the later Project stages.",
        "1.2.",
        "Stage 2.",
        "A new magnetic tape will be prepared of the reduced Brown Corpus text, and with the sentence sequence numbers interpolated.",

        "Stage 3.",
        "Using this magnetic tape, the IBM 360/30 will now prepare a full forward KWIC concordance of the reduced Brown Corpus text!",
        "1.4.",
        "Stage 4.",
        "Now (while the reduced Brown Corpus is still being translated) we shall use the same tape to obtain a reverse KWIC concordance of the same text.",
        "Since all \"function words\" - such as of, had, most, those, did, etc.",
        "- were already isolated in the previous stage (in the forward concordance)' this will further reduce the mass of text to be concordanced by one-halfr 1.5.",
        "Stage 5.",
        "The Serbo-Croat translation of the reduced Brown Corpus, by now in an advanced stage, will be copied out on a Flexowriter in batches (as translators send in their typescripts), resulting in a paper tape.",
        "1.51.",
        "The same procedure can, at thi• stage, be applied to the 300,000 words of the Control Corpus.",
        "No time for translation has to be set apart here, since only already published English translations of Serbo-Croat originals are to be used.",
        "1.6.",
        "Stage 6.",
        "Although the Serbo-Croat paper tapes obtained in the preceding stage are immediately computer-processable, we shall convert them to a magnetic tape, because this medium secures an incomparably speedier p•ocessing on the computer.",
        "1.61.",
        "We hope that stages 2 to 6 will not take more than twenty weeks (if enough personnel can be hired simultaneously).",
        "1.7.",
        "Stage 7.",
        "The Serbo-Croat magnetic tape will now be",
        ".10.",
        "The reason why these four concordances have been resented under one processing stage (9) is that, first, e are not sure whether we can afford the computer for ach of them, and, second, we do not, at this point, know ow selective each of them is going to be.",
        "A considerable eduction of the text to be concordanced can be achieved n reverse concordancing if we restrict ourselves only to ords, ending in a characteristic morpheme with clearly oreseeable contrastive analysis potential (such as -ed, 4, -est, -14E, -ness, -less, etc.",
        "in English, and -ao, vsi, -en, -scut -ost, -gte, etc.",
        "in Serbo-Croat).",
        ".11.",
        "It may be pointed out here that, irrespective of ow restrictive the selection of keywords for concordanc-n6 may have to be, no concessions should be made in the rinciple of bilingual approach.",
        "Only if,,in our investi-ation of the contrastive potential of individual eleents, we strictly observe the approach from both the nglish and the Serbo-Croat texts, can we be certain that e shall have covered all possible contrastive description atterns based on correspondences in both corpora.",
        ".0.",
        "Once contrastive concordancing has been completed we shall still be facing some practical technical problems.",
        "2.1.",
        "Project analysts, for instance, will often have to be provided with slips instead of computer printout sheets.",
        "Only if the material being analyzed is in the form of slips will they be able to classify and reclassify the key elements swiftly and flexibly (by putting together, breaking up and re-establishing batches of slips).",
        "2.11.",
        "Cutting up the concordance printouts to get the slips is not very practical in view of the varying size of contrasted pairs of elements with their context (cf. n. 9, second half).",
        "The way around this, clearly, is to have the pairs printed out at regular intervals with sufficient blank space in between.",
        "This, however, would probably triple the amount of printout paper required.",
        "Also, this is complicated further by the need for a number of copies for each pair (slip), because of simultaneous demands that may often be made upon the same slip by several Project analysts, approaching the same element from various descriptive levels.",
        "These copies could be secured by using special, multiple-carbon printout paper, but this might prove quite expensive.",
        "2.2.",
        "In view of all this, the Yugoslav Serbo-Croat/ English Contrastive Analysis Project has envisaged the use of a Flexowriter here as an alternative method.",
        "This machine has already provided us with the paper tape of the Serbo-Croat translation of the reduced Brown Corpus, plus the tapes of Serbo-Croat originals and English translations of the Control Corpus (cf.",
        "Stage 5).",
        "The missing paper tape of the English text of the Brown Corpus can be obtained on a magtape-to-papertape converter.",
        "Once both paper tapes are ready, running them through the Flexowriter provides us with up to 13 (some claim 20) carbons of each contrasted pair.",
        "An additional advantage of using the Flexowriter for slip duplication is in the less awkward shape of slips.",
        "Paper tapes reproduce the text in 60-character-wide lines of the original translators' typescript, as opposed to the 110 to 120-character streamers of normal computer printout (unless the concordance printout was programmed for a narrower format, requiring considerably more paper).",
        "2.3.",
        "The resulting slip files of sentence-numbered English and Serbo-Croat texts, coupled with the Project's basic (monolingual - forward and reverse) concordances, can now be used as a replacement for contrastive concordances.",
        "It would work approximately like this: upon receiving an analyst's request for examples of all correspondences in the corpus of an element under analysis, the Project headquarters in Zagreb would look the element up in one of the basic concordances, record sentence numbers of all the occurrences, extract slips bearing these numbers from the Flexowriter-produced slip file, and forward them to the analyst for further research.",

        "Expanding the exclusion list to cover the top 200 words would probably not be economical (though only two additional morphologically marked words would be included: UIITED and STATES), because the computer would be slowed down, whereas the textual",
        "mass would be reduced by only 6 more per cent (to 53.6 per cent.",

        "In addition to being simulations, all these concordance samples are in an idealized format, with the correspondences spatially parallel to the keyword.",
        "In practice, however, it is impossible to achieve this ideal textual parallelism, because there are no other formal signals to govern it, except the sentence sequence number which can only mark the sentence as a whole.",
        "For this reason, the actual computer concordances will, when ready, have the correspondence to the keyword printed out with the whole sentence in which it occurs, under the single line with the keyword.",
        "This will, naturally, increase the size of the concordance, but not more than about 50 per cent in our estimate.",
        "This is because only an approximate 40 per cent of all sentences in the original text of the Brown Corpus are in excess of 20 words (which can be accommodated by the average printout line).",
