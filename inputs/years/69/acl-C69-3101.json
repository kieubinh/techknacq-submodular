        "Since the MT-System of IBM Germany has already been described elsewhere [5] [6], we shall confine us to the aspects of the system which are substantial to our problem.",
        "The system consists of two linguistically significant parts: a machine lexicon residing on a direct access device and a program package.",
        "The machine lexicon contains:",
        "1.",
        "English words, 2. a code providing grammatical information about each word, 3.",
        "German equivalents.",
        "In case of more than one possible German equivalent of an English word, there are - roughly spoken - as many separate lexicon entries in the machine lexicon as German translations.",
        "To put it in a more precise way: for an English homograph, redundant as it may be, there is a separate lexicon entry for each of its syntactic funtions, i.e. an English word like CHANGE has been entered in the lexicon as a noun CHANGE, with the German translation: ANDERUNG and also as a verb CHANGE, with the translation VERANDERN.",
        "The order of entries is fixed.",
        "While the machine lexicon provides each English word with one or more German equivalents, the program package operating on the lexicon develops the proper translation for the English input text.",
        "The first step of processing is the lexical assignment, i.e. each English word is looked up in the machine lexicon and its first occurence in the lexicon is taken as the provisional translation (4] .",
        "The following steps care for the proper choice of the German equivalents from those other alternatives provided by the lexicon, which remain accessible throughout the entire subsequent processing.",
        "In order to choose the correct equivalent, the programs rely on the original word order of the English input text and the codes which are primarily drawn from the lexicon.",
        "Generally it can be said, that as the processing progresses, we have more and more information about the linguistic structures at our disposal, and we can make increasingly subtle decisions.",
        "It is obvious that to distinguish between 2 verbs and nouns is logically prior to the distinction between, say, abstract nouns and concrete nouns.",
        "(In praxi, however, the sequence of subroutines may not always be as simple as that.)",
        "Similarly, we can distinguish between transitive, reflexive and intransitive verbs, only after having established the category of verbs in general, i.e. after the solution of homographs like: PLACE noun PLACE verb CHANGE noun CHANGE verb Although the disambiguation of syntactic homographs is by no means a trivial task, we shall not go into further details about its actual realisation.",
        "For the following discussion we shall therefore presume, that occurring syntactic homographs have been solved.",
        "2.0 The Problem Consider the following sentence pairs: (la) The company has .increased the ptoduction.",
        "(lb) The pnoduction has inoteased napidty.",
        "(2a) Registeit 3 Aetutned the value unchanged.",
        "(2b) The access cam /Leta/lolled to its oniginat position.",
        "It is clear that the (a) and (b) sentences have to be translated in a different way:",
        "(la\") Die Gesettschalit hat die Pnoduktion enhoeht Q.",
        "(16\") Die Pkoduktion hat zich schnett enhoeht.",
        "(2a\") RegiAteh 3 btachte den Went unvetaendent zutueck.",
        "(2b\") Den Zug/tibia/1AI kehtte zu seinen unspituengtichen Position zutuech.",
        "It is not difficult to see that the linguistically relevant criterion for the proper German translation is the presence or absence of a direct object-NP.",
        "For the German translation of (lb) the implicit object must be made explicit by the insertion of the German reflexive pronoun SICH.",
        "In the second example we have to select two differe t verbs to render both (2a) and (2b) correctly into German"

        "We have tried to show, however, that even the empirical approach felt the need for multidimensional structuring, and certain rules set up on empirical considerations - e.g. those treating verb with multiple meaning - turn out to be mappings of phrase markers into phrase markers in the transformational sense.",
