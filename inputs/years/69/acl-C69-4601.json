        "A computer program for automatic identification of \"fullform\" case citations in legal literature (e.g., Rutherford v. Geddes, 4 Wall.",
        "220, 18 L. Ed.",
        "343; Southland Industries, Incorporated v. Federal Communications Commission, 1938, 69 App.",
        "D.C., 82, 99 F. 2D 117) has been developed at the University of Pittsburgh and is now operational.",
        "The level of performance of this program known as \"The Citation Identifier\" is high.",
        "In a recent computer run, The Citation Identifier scanned the full texts of 191 randomly selected decisions of U.S. Court of Appeals (some 400,000 words of running text) and located correctly 2,220 full-form citations out of a total of 2,227 (that is better than 99% of the total).",
        "Only seven misses and three false drops occurred.",
        "Of 2,220 full-form citations which were located correctly, 1944 (87%) were identified perfectly.",
        "In addition, there were 276 partial identifications containing two types of errors:",
        "(1) partial identifications in which some citation terms were mistakenly lopped off by the program (so-called \"short hits\"), and (2) partial identifications which contained words that were improperly included in the citations (so-called \"long hits\").",
        "Both types of errors are for the most part easily correctable and can be largely eliminated by suitable changes in the program.",
        "The Citation Identifier operates rather rapidly.",
        "In a recent test run, the total time required to process some 400,000 running words of text was approximately fifteen and a half minutes.",
        "This speed could be further increased by suitable Changes in the computer program.",
        "An extension of the Citation Identifier to reduced-form citations (e.g., \"The Geddes decision,\" \"the Southland Industries case\") is now in preparation.",
        "Motivation for Automatic Identification of Case Citations in Legal Literature.",
        "Efficient administration of justice has often been hampered by the slowness and inefficiency of ordinary methods of legal information handling.",
        "Because lawyers, judges, government attorneys, legislators, and others find access to necessary legal data often slow and inefficient, they are frequently unable to act with the speed and the effectiveness which the circumstances may demand of them.",
        "Thus, for example, members of the legal profession are often unable to procure, promptly, exhaustive and accurate data concerning legal precedents of various court decisions.",
        "This has often hampered the initiation of legal actions, slowed down the preparation of defense and offense, delayed the preparation of new laws, and otherwise interfered with the efficiency of legal processes.",
        "However, wise automation of certain critical areas of legal information processing could alleviate considerably the present crisis in legal documentation.",
        "For example, a set of -2-computer programs capable of exhaustive, accurate, rapid, and economical identification of legal precedents in legal literature would do much to eliminate from legal documentation one of its most serious bottlenecks.",
        "Since many or most legal precedents are referred to in legal literature by means of full-form and reduced-form case citations, (e.g., respectively, \"Healy v. Penna.",
        "BR.",
        "Co., supra\" and \"the Healy case\"), automatic identification of both forms of case citations would go fax in the direction of automatic identification of legal precedents in legal literature.",
        "However, a perusal of legal texts shows that automatic identification of full-form citations is both much simpler than that of reduced-form citations and also a prerequisite for efficient identification of the latter.",
        "Therefore, construction of a set of programs for automatic identification of legal precedents in legal literature has begun with the construction of a computer program for automatic identification in legal texts of full-form legal citations.",
        "State of the Art and the Genesis of The Citation Identifier.",
        "Practical work in legal automatic information retrieval has until now revolved mainly around: (1) the preparation of concordances to legal texts, (2) KWIC indexing of legal texts, and (3) matching of legal texts with the key terms of queries and interest profiles.",
        "These well-established automatic information retrieval activities have met with considerable success.42",
        "In addition, a sizable amount of time and energy has been devoted to automatic construction from computer-readable legal texts of legal indexes and legal thesauri by means of , various statistical techniques.34 However, to the best of our knowledge, these interesting procedures have not been incorporated into any practical legal information systems.",
        "No previous attempts at automatic identification of case names in legal texts have come to our attention; however, this general type of activity has been extensively discussed by Casimir Borkowsi and derives directly from his efforts aimed at automatic identification in texts of classes of words and of word Strings referring to various types of individuals, objects, processes, acts, relations, groups, etc.5,6,7,819 The Citation Identifier was first undertaken by Borkowski and his students in the Department of Computer Science of the University of Pittsburgh, in early 1968 as part of a workshop section of a graduate course in automatic text processing.",
        "Research and development procedures adapted by Borkowski and his group were approximately as follows: A set of challenging but nevertheless resolvable problems in automatic text processing was presented to the class, discussed, and resolved in a general way.",
        "A detailed solution of one of the problems, namely, automatic identification of full-form case citations, was then worked out, flowcharted and programmed in a high-level programming language (PENELOPE)1Â° for the IBM 360/50 computer of the University of Pittsburgh.",
        "-4-Computer-readable legal texts were made available to the class by Aspen Systems Corporation (formerly, the Health Law Center of the University of Pittsburgh), and both the teacher and the students want to take this opportunity to thank Aspen Systems for these data.",
        "Since the termination of the original classroom workshop project, The Citation Identifier was reprogrammed in OS/360 assembly language for Aspen's IBM 360/40 by Sperling Martin, one of the students, who is also with Aspen Systems Corporation.",
        "The effectiveness of this recent version of The Citation Identifier constitutes, along with an outline of its present structure, the subject matter of this paper."
