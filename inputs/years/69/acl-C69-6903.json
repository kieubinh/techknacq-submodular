        "We start with Chomsky's definition of the lexical entry as the whole of the phonological, semantic and syntactic distinctive features.",
        "This definition is interpreted matricially.",
        "The lexical entry's matrix contains semantic referrences to the sense and signification of the linguistic objects - the words.",
        "Introducing the matrixes of the lexical entries - which are grouped in a sentence - in its (the sentence's) matrix, we study vectorially the elements of the structural description (the Base component and the Transformational component of the Grammar).",
        "The different grammatical and semantic categories which determine the relations in the sentence - have different vectors (theoretically the vectors are of unitary dimension and are considered as free and situated in the same plane) in the system of calculus.",
        "In short is dealt also with the problem of referentials, but this problem is not solved exhaustiVely."
