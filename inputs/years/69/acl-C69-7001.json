        "Consider a device designed to read a text in some natural language, interpret it, and store the content in some manner, say, for the purpose of being able to answer questions about it.",
        "To accomplish this task, the machine will have to fulfill at least the following basic requirement.",
        "It has to be able to build a file that consists of records of all the individuals, that is, events, objects, etc., mentioned in the text, and, for each individual, record whatever is said about it.",
        "Of course, for the time being at least, it seems that such a text interpreter is not a practical idea, but this should not discourage us from studying in abstract what kind of capabilities the machine would have to possess, provided that our study provides us with some insight into natural language in general.",
        "In this paper I intend to discuss one particular feature a text interpreter must have: that it must be able to recognize when a novel individual is mentioned in the input text and to store it along with its characterization for future reference.",
        "Of course, in some cases the problem is trivial.",
        "Suppose there appears in some sentence a proper name that has not been mentioned previously.",
        "This means that a new -2-person is being introduced in the text and appropriate action must be taken to record the name of the person and what is said about him.",
        "Otherwise, the proper name is used to refer to an individual already mentioned and the machine has to locate his file in the memory with the help of the name.",
        "This problem of identification will be more difficult where a definite description--a definite noun phrase such as the man Bill saw yesterday--is used, since there will, in general, not be any simple lookup procedure for associating the description with the right individual.",
        "With definite noun phrases there is also the problem that it is not possible to tell just from the noun phrase itself whether or not it is supposed to refer to an individual at all.",
        "For example, it is clear that the phrase the best student is not used referentially in a sentence such as Bill is the best student.",
        "There are thus two problems with ordinary definite noun phrases: (i) Is it a definite description at all?",
        "and (ii) How to match a definite description with an individual already mentioned in the text?",
        "The first question is clearly of the kind linguists can be expected to solve, but it will not be discussed here.",
        "The only aspect of definite descriptions that interests us here is the fact that they carry an existential presupposition: to call something \"the ...\" presupposes that there be some such thing.",
        "While it is in general a straightforward matter to decide -3-whether or not aproper name in a text introduces a new individual, indefinite noun phrases pose a more difficult problem.",
        "To put the question in a general way: Given an indefinite noun phrase, under what circumstances is there supposed to be an individual described by this noun phrase?",
        "This need not be understood as some sort of ontological question subject to philosophical speculation.",
        "In this paper I intend to approach it from a purely linguistic point of view.",
        "It is in just those cases where the appearance of an indefinite NP implies the existence of some specific entity that our hypothetical text interpreter should record the appearance of a new individual.",
        "What I have in mind can perhaps be made clear with the help of the following examples.",
        "It is a well-known fact about language that indefinite noun phrases cannot be interpreted as referring to expressions when they appear in the predicate nominal position.",
        "(1) Bill is not a linguist.",
        "(1) is obviously a statement about one individual.",
        "It is not a statement about some linguist and Bill.",
        "It is also well-known that in generic sentences singular indefinite noun phrases play a peculiar role.",
        "(2) A lion is a mighty hunter.",
        "In its generic sense, (2) is a statement about lions in general, not about any lion in particular, unless we want to postulate a hypothetical entity 'the typical lion' of whom all generic statements about lions are predicated.",
        "It is clear that indefinite noun phrases have a very special role in (1) and (2) and it is not difficult to decide that they could not introduce any new individuals into a discourse.",
        "It is out of question that a text in which (1) appears would contain a later reference to 'the linguist which Bill is not' or that (2), in its generic sense, would justify a later reference to 'the lion who is a mighty hunter'.",
        "But consider the following example.",
        "(3a) may be followed by any of the sentences (3b-d) that give us more information about a specific car first mentioned in (3a).",
        "(b) It is black.",
        "(3) (a) Bill has a car.",
        "(c) The car is black.",
        "(d) Bill's car is black.",
        "On the other hand, (4a) cannot be followed by any of the alternatives (4b-d).",
        "(b) *It is black.",
        "(4) (a) Bill doesn't have a car.",
        "(c) *The car is black.",
        "(d) *Bill's car is black.",
        "The above examples show that just in case of (3a), the text interpreter has to recognize that the appearance of the indefinite NP a car implies the existence of a specific car that can be talked about again by referring to it with a pronoun or a definite noun phrase.",
        "But no car is introduced by (4a).",
        "The alternative continuations (4b-d) are inappropriate, since they presuppose the existence of something that is not there.",
        "To show that this is a linguistic and not an ontological -5-fact one only has to point out that examples (5) and (6) behave just like (3) and (4).",
        "(5) Bill saw a unicorn.",
        "The unicorn had a gold mane.",
        "(6) Bill didn't see a unicorn.",
        "*The unicorn had a gold mane.",
        "Let us say that the appearance of an indefinite noun phrase establishes",
        "a discourse referent just in case it justifies the occurrence of a coreferential pronoun or a definite noun phrase later in the text.",
        "In this paper we will try to find out under what circumstances discourse referents are established.",
        "We maintain that the problem of corefer-ence within a discourse is a linguistic problem and can be studied independently of any general theory of extralinguistic reference.",
        "The present study was inspired by the notion of 'referential indices' in transformational grammar.",
        "Following a suggestion by Noam Chomsky (1965), it has generally been assumed that the base component of a transformational grammar associates with each noun phrase a referential index, say, some integer.",
        "The purpose of Chomsky's proposal was not so much to account for the meaning of sentences, but to augment the notion of noun phrase identity.",
        "It seemed that the notion of 'referential identity' was needed in addition to the two other types of identity, 'structural identity' and 'morphemic identity', for the structural descriptions of certain transformations.",
        "According to the standard theory, referential indices are merely -6-formal indicators of coreference with no further semantic significance.",
        "They are not meant to imply the existence of discourse referents in our sense.",
        "This notion of coreferentiality has played an important role in recent syntactic arguments.",
        "It led to the study of pronoun-antecedent relations, largely ignored by traditional grammarians, which has revealed intricate constraints that have great theoretical importance.",
        "What we are studying in this paper can be looked at as further constraints on coreferentiality that extend beyond the sentence level.",
        "1.",
        "Case studies 1.",
        "1 A note on specificity",
        "In the following we are going to examine case by case certain aspects of sentence structure that play a role in determining whether an indefinite NP establishes a discourse referent.",
        "In the examples that are discussed, there is a possible ambiguity that has to be mentioned in advance, although it will not be discussed until later.",
        "In general, indefinite noun phrases have both a specific and non-specific interpretation.",
        "Example (7) can be interpreted to mean either (8a) or (8b).",
        "(7) Bill didn't see a misprint.",
        "(8) (a) 'There is a misprint which Bill didn't see' (b) 'Bill saw no misprints'",
        "-7-If (7) is understood in the sense of (8a), we say that the indefinite NP a misprint is interpreted specifically.",
        "(8b) represents the non-specific interpretation.",
        "Of course, not all indefinite noun phrases are ambiguous in this way.",
        "We could disambiguate (7) by adding the word certain (\"a certain misprint\") or an appositive relative clause (\"a misprint, which I had made on purpose\").",
        "These changes would allow only the specific interpretation (8a).",
        "The addition of the word single (\"a single misprint\") would allow only the sense (8b).",
        "There are also cases where the verbs involved partially disambiguate the sentence by making one interpretation far more plausible to the reader than the other.",
        "For example, the NP a piano in (9a) is naturally understood non-specifically, that is, as meaning 'any piano', while the same noun phrase in (9b) suggests the",
        "1 interpretation 'a certain piano'.",
        "(9) (a) John tried to find a piano.",
        "[but he didn't succeed in finding one] (b) John tried to lift a piano.",
        "[but he didn't succeed in lifting it]",
        "It is something about the verb lift that suggests that a piano describes some specific object.",
        "On the other hand, (9a) is easily understood to inform us only about the kind of object John was trying to find.",
        "We note in passing that, if interpreted in the above manner, (9b) establishes a -8-discourse referent, i.e. , 'the piano John tried to lift', but (9a) certainly does not justify a later reference to 'the piano John tried to find'.",
        "Example (7) establishes a referent in its specific sense 'the misprint which Bill didn't see', but fails to do so in the sense, of (81o).",
        "Let us forget, for the time being, that indefinite noun phrases can also be understood specifically and consider first only non-specific interpretations."

        "The present problem, is in fact, another point in favor of the view that modals originate in a higher sentence, because it enables us to acknowledge the similarity of the anomaly in (10) and (11).",

        "The non-factive verb is binding for the speaker only in case he is talking in the first person as in (17).",
        "But even in case that the speaker withholds judgment or disagrees altogether, an indefinite NP in the complement of a non-factive verb that implies positive belief does establish a referent of a peculiar sort.",

        "In general, discourse referents exist in the realm 'world as seen by the speaker'.",
        "However, the non-factive verbs discussed in § 1.24 establish referents in other realms and are ambiguous as far as the speaker is concerned.",
        "In order to decide whether or not a non-specific indefinite NP is to be associated with a referent, a text interpreting device must be able to assign a truth value to the proposition represented by the sentence in which the NP appears.",

        "This is clearly one of those cases where semantic problems can be simplified by assuming a more abstract deep structure.",
        "But it is not entirely clear what kind of embedded sentence should underly the surface object.",
        "There seems to be little evidence for deciding this question beyond the observation that it certainly should be some type of existential or possessive construction.",

        "In order to take care of these phenomena, a text interpreting device apparently has to process complex sentences starting from the inside.",

        "In processing a sentence, a text interpreter apparently has to associate an indefinite NP with a variable and attach the binding quantifier to some sentence above the NP using whatever clues there are present to - 30 - assign the scope with as little ambiguity as possible.",
        "Clues that reduce scope ambiguity include the presence of an appositive relative clause or of special words such as \"certain\", \"single\", and \"some\" in the noun phrase itself and the surface order of quantifiers, negation, and articles in the rest of the sentence.",
        "Secondly, the interpreter has to keep track of the truth value of the proposition represented by the sentence to which the quantifier is attached.",

        "Of the three sentences involved, only Si is asserted by the speaker to be a true proposition.",
        "The two other sentences, S2 and S3, are both commanded by a modal verb (may and want), therefore, their truth is not implied or presupposed.",
        "The indefinite NP a Swede establishes a discourse referent just in case its binding quantifier is attached to S1' This can be demonstrated easily by pointing out that, if the speaker continues the discourse with (46), the preceding sentence (43) can only be understood in the sense of (45a).",

        "However, the following continuation, .where the pronoun it' stands for S2, permits both (45a) and (45b).",

        "As a final example, after some thought it should be obvious that a discourse consisting of (43) and (48), where the first it in (48) stands for S2 and the second it for S3 is three ways ambiguous just as (43) - 32 - by itself.",
        "Since all three component propositions of (44) are now either asserted or supposed to be true, there is no way of resolving the inherent scope ambiguity by looking at the coreferentiality of a Swede and him.",
        "(48) Suppose that it is true and that she does it, then she will certainly introduce him to her mother.",
        "Although the argument against the traditional feature [±specific] should leave no doubt about its uselessness in discussing anything but the simplest kind of scope ambiguity, it does not necessarily mean that the familiar terms 'specific' and 'non-specific' should be rejected.",
        "They have proved quite useful and no harm is done, provided that they are understood in a relative sense and not as denoting some absolute property inherent in indefinite noun phrases.",
        "For example, consider interpretation (45b) of (43), which assigns the quantifier to S2.",
        "One might want to say that, with respect to the verb want the indefinite NP a Swede is specific.",
        "On the other hand, if the quantifier is attached to S3, as in (45c), a Swede could be called non-specific with respect to want.",
        "In general', let us call an indefinite NP specific with respect to a given verb (or quantifier, or negation) if the latter is in the scope of the quantifier associated with the NP.",
        "It is non-specific in case the verb commands the quantifier.",
        "This kind of definition seems consistent with the way these terms have been used - 33 - in recent literature, and there is no reason to stop using them as long as the relative nature of specificity is understood."
