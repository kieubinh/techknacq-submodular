        "The basis of each description of a text of any language is a morphological analysis of this text.",
        "One can easily agree that such a description has to be derived from the words or sentences of the text which is to be described.",
        "The expression \" description of a text \" is understood in a very general sense.",
        "One can imagine a syntactic description or a semantic interpretation or a combination of both of them or any other information.",
        "In a natural language the number of the possible texts is not finite.",
        "That's easy to prove because of the following sentences: One is a number Two is a number Hence it's impossible in practice to use a lexicon of the following form text 1 description of text 1 text 2 description of text 2"
