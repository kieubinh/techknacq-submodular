        "This paper is concerned with semantic (or lexical) structures of the type used in programs which involve natural language processing, such as question-answering systems.",
        "These structures, which generally take the form of graphs representing semantic relations defined on word senses, must satisfy some rather self-evident requirements relating to their linguistic significance and adequacy and to their suitability for computational implementation.",
        "In addition, if the lexical subsets in question are to be nontrivial in size, the structures must be constructible in some systematic, consistent way, preferably with the aid of a computer.",
        "The structures which have been used in existing experimental systems, such as those reported in M. R. QUILLIAN (1969) and R. M. SCHWARCZ, J. F. BURGER, R. F. SIMMONS (1970), have generally been very restricted, and it has been argued (S. Y. SEDELOW, 1972) that it is their lack of constructibility which has precluded the possibility of extending them.",
        "The aim of this paper is to describe two examples of the use of constructibility as a design criterion for semantic structures.",
        "The semantic relations of hyponymy and compatibility are introduced in the following section, and suitable representations for them are developed in sections 3 and 4, respectively.",
        "Throughout the discussion, the constructibility of a representation is to be interpreted as its amenability to the use of a computational discovery algorithm which would build the structure and have the properties of semi-automatic operation, simple input data, efficiency in the quantity of input, consistency maintenance, and monotonic refinement of the growing structure.",
        "The meaning of this terminology will be made more clear in the course of the discussion.",
        "It is far beyond the scope of the paper to consider the development and implementation of practical programs for building large semantic structures.",
        "It should also be emphasized that the aim is not the development of linguistic theories or the presentation of particular lexical structures.",
        "While the linguistic positions adopted in the following section are consistent with much of the existing literature, they are primarily intended to provide a sample context in which the role of constructibility may be illustrated."

        "The term hyponymy has been used by J. LYONS (1968) to denote the common but somewhat vague notion of \" semantic inclusion \".",
        "A hyponymy p of a word sense q is a word sense whose meaning is a subset \" of the meaning of q; for example, scarlet is a hyponym of red, and tulip is a hyponym of flower.",
        "Intuitively, if p is a hyponym of q, then it makes sense to say that p is a kind of q. Synonymy of word senses may be defined in terms of hyponymy: p is a synonym of q if and only if p is a hyponym of q and q is a hyponym of p. The hyponymy relation is evidently reflexive and transitive.",
        "The importance of hyponymy has been generally recognized by workers in computational semantics (see, for example, M. R. Qua-LIAN, 1969, and R. M. SCHWARCZ, J. F. BURGER, R. F. SIMMONS, 1970).",
        "Quillian's system (M. R. QUILLIAN, 1969) is a generalization of a scheme for representing lexical definitions of word senses in terms of supersets and properties, where the superset relation is simply the inverse of hyponymy.",
        "When the superset of some sense is modified by the relevant properties, an expression is obtained which is a definition of paraphrase of the given sense.",
        "As a highly simplified example, suppose that the superset of bachelor is man, with the corresponding property unmarried, and that the superset of youth is also man, with the corresponding property young.",
        "A simple calculation would then mark the expressions young bachelor and unmarried youth as paraphrases, since both are equivalent to the expression young unmarried man.",
        "Although I have not mentioned many of the details and problems involved (such as the possible forms properties may take), it seems clear that a representation for hyponymy is necessary for such important semantic processes as transformation between equivalent linguistic expressions."

        "Turning to the compatibility relation, the simplest case involves combinations of adjective senses and noun senses to form expressions which may be either meaningful (hungry man) or meaningless (hungry theory).",
        "The two senses may be said to be compatible if their combination is meaningful.",
        "It turns out that little can be done with regard to the representation of this relation unless its definition is extended as follows: two adjective senses are compatible if and only if there are noun senses compatible with both.",
        "It is useful here to think of noun senses as \" atoms or \" constants and adjective senses as \" predicates which take noun senses as arguments (this is similar to Fillmore's approach [CI FILLMORE, 1969.",
        "The second definition of compatibility then involves the intersections of the domains of predicates.",
        "This relation, which is reflexive and symmetric, will be the more important as far as constructibility is concerned.",
        "As for the use of compatibility, on the other hand, the first definition is the important one.",
        "First, in a linguistic or computational system involving the generation or analysis of sentences, it would be useful in excluding meaningless constructions of word senses, and it can be argued that this capability is a fundamental one for any such system.",
        "Secondly, the relation provides the ability to disambiguate words in the context of their combination with other words.",
        "For example, suppose that hard has two senses written as hard (difficult) and hard (not soft), and that ball has the two senses ball (round object) and ball (social event).",
        "Suppose further that hard (difficult) is compatible with question and incompatible with both senses of ball, and that hard (not soft) is incompatible with question and ball (social event) but compatible with ball (round object).",
        "Then, in the expression hard question, hard must mean hard (dcult).",
        "Similarly, in the expression hard ball, hard must mean hard (not soft) and ball must mean ball (round object), since the other three combinations are all incompatible."

        "In an F-graph such as this, each node corresponds to a sense, and the interpretation of the structure is that x is a hyponym of y if and only if there is an arc from x's node toy's node (strictly speaking, since hyponymy is reflexive, there should be a loop at each node, but these may be omitted without loss of information)."

        "An F-graph is the transitive closure of its corresponding G-graph, and the G-graph has no \" redundant \" arcs; i.e., arcs from x to y and from y to z imply that there is no arc from x to z.",
        "This, together with the fact that synonyms are represented by separate nodes, implies that G-graphs are not necessarily unique; for example, the G-graph in Fig. 4 is equivalent to that in Fig. 3.",
        "This non-uniqueness may be avoided by transforming the G-graph into an H-graph, in which synonyms are associated with the same node but the interpretation is otherwise unchanged.",
        "All H-graphs are acyclic, since all the senses on a cycle would have identical hyponymy relationships with all other senses, i.e., they would be synonyms.",
        "Thus the nodes form a partially ordered set, and H-graphs may be represented by lattice-like Hasse diagrams (D. E. RUTHERFORD, 1965) where each edge is assumed to be directed towards the top of the page, although the arrows are not explicitly present (Fig.",
        "5).",
        "It may easily be seen that H-graphs are in one-to-one correspondence with the set of all possible hyponymy matrices (transitive, square, Boolean matrices).",
        "They are thus a fully general class of structures, and the question arises as to whether the set of linguistically significant structures is actually more restrictive than this.",
        "Judging from the ex-sting literature in pure and applied linguistics, there would seem to be a consensus that hyponymy graphs should in fact be tree-structured.",
        "This is apparently the case in Quillian's system (M. R. QUILLIAN, 1969), for example, and some experimental support for the psychological reality of this type of structure is given in A. M. COLLINS, M. R. QUILLIAN (1969).",

        "H-forests could be constructed with better efficiency than H-graphs since they are a much more predictive class of structures; for example, if z were found to be \" unrelated \" at the root of a tree, then it would be predicted to be \" unrelated \" everywhere in the tree.",
