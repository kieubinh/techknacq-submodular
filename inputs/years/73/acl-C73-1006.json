        "As is known, metalanguage is a language by means of which another language is described.",
        "The latter is called object-language.",
        "One and the same language may play the role of object-language and metalanguage.",
        "For example, the Russian language taken as an object of linguistic description is an object-language, the Russian language used for a linguistic description of Russian is a metalanguage.",
        "There are non-formal and formal metalanguages.",
        "For example, the Russian language used in ordinary grammars of Russian as a means of describing the Russian language is a non-formal metalanguage.",
        "Formal metalanguage is an artificial language, defined by deductive rules of construction, and used to describe natural languages.",
        "The problem of formal metalanguages for linguistic descriptions is a broad topic which we do not mean to -exhaust.",
        "We shall restrict ourselves to clarifying the role of formal metalanguages in constructing generative grammars.",
        "Every generative grammar is a formal theory.",
        "For example, a generative grammar of Russian is a formal theory of Russian, a generative grammar of English is a formal theory of English.",
        "We shall focus our attention on the question of correlation between formal metalanguages and formal linguistic theories understood as generative grammars.",
        "Let us take a concrete example: formal metalanguage and formal theory as two aspects of applicative generative grammar.",
        "This concrete example will make it possible, we hope, to draw certain general conclusions about the role of formal metalanguages in generative grammar.",
        "We shall start with formal metalanguage in applicative generative grammar.",
        "We call this metalanguage a universal operator language.",
        "The universal operator language is defined by the grammar which is an ordered quadruple",
        "where: 1.",
        "V, is the lexicon of symbols whose denotata belong to a finite set of elementary categories called elementary episemions.",
        "The elementary episemions are denoted by the symbols a and f3.",
        "The first is interpreted as the category of terms, and the second – as the category of sentences.",
        "The episemion p is called the distinguished episemion.",
        "Complex categories called episemions are constructed from elementary episemions.",
        "The construction of episemions is effected with the help of the function A, which maps episemions into each other.",
        "The rules for constructing episemions are the following :",
        "(a) elementary episemions are episemions (b) if p and q are episemions, then A pq is also an episemion.",
        "Rule (b) presented as a tree looks as follows: (1) P q pq For example:",
        "The episemion zap may be interpreted as the category of one-place predicates (i.e. the function which maps terms into sentences), for example burn, arrive, sleep, stay etc.",
        "cc Ave The episemion Aaa may be interpreted as the category of term identifiers (i.e. the function which maps terms into terms), for example big, good, John's, burning (in burning eyes, burning house) etc.",
        "The episemion AaAap may be interpreted as the category of two-place predicates (i.e. the function which maps terms into one-place predicates or, in other words, the function which maps two terms into sentences), for example read, see, expect, like etc.",
        "The episemion Accpa may be interpreted as the category of depred-icators (i.e. the function which maps one-place predicates into terms), .",
        "for example al (in arrival), -ation (in relaxation) etc.",
        "The episemion AccAcoz may be interpreted as the category of denominative adjectivisers (i.e. the function which maps terms into term identifiers), for example y (in stony path), less (in heartless man), 's (in John's house), of (in the house of John) etc.",
        "The episemion AAccpAoca may be interpreted as the category of adjec-tivising depredicators (i.e. the function which maps one-place predicates into term identifiers), for example -ing (in burning house), y (sleepy child) etc.",
        "2.",
        "Vs is the lexicon of symbols whose denotata are elementary meanings.",
        "These symbols are called elementary semions.",
        "For example T – an elementary semion which is interpreted as an object belonging to the category of terms.",
        "Pi – an elementary semion interpreted as an object belonging to the category of one-place predicates.",

        "SfA – an elementary semion interpreted as an object belonging to the category of denominative adjectivisers etc.",
        "3.",
        "F is a so-called assignment function which places each elementary semion in correspondence with one or several episemions.",
        "The work of the assignment function may be represented by the formula eX",
        "where e is any episemion and X is a semion with which it has been placed in correspondence, for example",
        "4.",
        "R – are rules for constructing combinations of elementary semions which are called semions.",
        "These rules are as follows: (a) an elementary semion is a semion; (b) if X is a semion which belongs to the episemion A pq, and Y is a semion, belonging to the episemion p, then (XY) is a semion, belonging to the episemion q.",
        "We shall call X an operator, Y – an operand, and (XY) is the result of application of X to Y.",
        "Rule (b) is called the rule of application of semions.",
        "Rule (b) can be illustrated in the following way:",
        "guage analogue of the semion PIT is stays John rather than John stays).",
        "Below are given several more illustrations of rule (b):",
        "If the elementary semion DA is interpreted as -ing, P, as burn (intr.",
        "), then the semion DAP, is interpreted as burning.",
        "If T is interpreted as house, then the semion ((DAPOT) is interpreted as burning house.",
        "(The exact order of elements being ((-ing burn) house)).",
        "If SfA is interpreted as 's, T – as John, then SfA T corresponds to John's.",
        "If DT is interpreted as -al, Pi – as arrive, then DTA corresponds to arrival.",
        "The derived semion ((SfAT) (DTP)) serves as a genotype analogue of the noun phrase John's arrival (the exact order of elements being (('s John) (-al arrive))).",
        "Such is the grammar which defines the construction of the universal operator language.",
        "If an empirical interpretation is assigned to episemions and semions, the universal operator language may serve as a formal metalanguage for the description of any natural language.",
        "The universal operator language has sufficient potentialities to construct semions which serve as abstract analogues of sentences of any degree of complexity.",
        "By way of an example we shall construct semions which serve as abstract analogues of the following complex phrases: I see a burning house (12) and I expect John's arrival (13).",
        "The tree below shows the construction of the genotype analogue of the first phrase: A AapAaaDA AocriPi Aaa (DAPi) a P",
        "The final semion ((P2 (PAN Ti)) T2) which is an object belonging to the category of i.e. sentence, is an abstract analogue of a two-place predicate sentence with a participle defining one of its terms.",
        "The construction of the second semion is shown below:",
        "The final semion P2((SfAT1) (DTP1))T2 which also belongs to the category of 13, i.e. sentence, is an abstract analogue of a two-place predicate sentence with a nominalized phrase as one of its arguments.",
        "However complex the constructed semion may be, the process of construction fails to show how two primitive structures of the type I see a house and The house is burning are transformed into (12), the second becoming a participial phrase in (12), or how two primitive structures of the type I expect smth.",
        "and John is arriving are transformed into (13), the second becoming a nominalized phrase in (13).",
        "Though the construction of semions accounts for the generation of the abstract analogues of sentences of any degree of complexity it does not aim to show such essential grammatical processes as nomi-nalization or adjectivation of phrases, formation of complex predicates from simple ones or of simple sentences from complex sentences etc.",
        "So in spite of the abstract character of the universal operator language it does not allow us to rise above the level of taxonomic description of natural languages.",
        "The necessity for the formal theory of natural languages follows from the two-level principle in linguistic studies.",
        "According to the two-level principle every natural language is stratified into two languages: the phenotype language and the genotype language.",
        "The phenotype language is a natural language as is given in immediate observation.",
        "The genotype language is hidden, not given in immediate observation; it is a construct language which consists of two sub-languages: the basic genotype language and the derived genotype language.",
        "The basic genotype language is the language of thought representation; the expressions of the basic genotype language which consist of elementary predicates may be identified with the thoughts which are to be embodied into a linguistic form.",
        "The embodiment FORMAL METALANGUAGE AND FORMAL THEORY 69 of thoughts into a lingustic form is effected in two stages.",
        "At the first stage the expressions of the basic genotype language, which are identified with thoughts, are transformed into the expressions of the derived genotype language, regarded as abstract linguistic forms which embody thoughts.",
        "At the second stage the expressions of the derived genotype language are transformed into the expressions of the phenotype language regarded as the concrete linguistic forms of thought embodiment.",
        "Thus, the derived genotype language may be considered as an intermediary language between the basic genotype language and the phenotype language.",
        "The transformations used to convert phrases of the basis genotype language into phrases of the derived genotype language may be described with the help of logical operators called combinators.1 Since natural languages serve the purpose of communication between people, the grammar of every natural languages must possess the means for the transformation of thoughts into linguistic forms and, vice-versa, the means for the transformation of linguistic forms into thoughts.",
        "Grammar viewed in such a way is a hypothetic transducer, which is not given in immediate observation, but which makes it possible to transform the phrases of the basic genotype languages into the phrases of the derived genotype language, and the phrases of the derived genotype language into the phrases of the phenotype language, and vice-versa, the phrases of the phenotype language into the phrases of the derived genotype language, as well as the phrases of the derived genotype language into the phrases of the basic genotype language.",
        "The formal theory of natural languages must use the universal operator language as a formal metalanguage for a description of the basic genotype language, the derived genotype language and the phenotype language.",
        "Below we shall specify the type of rules for postulating the basic genotype language and the type of rules for obtaining the derived genotype language.",
        "The basic genotype language consists of one-, two-and three-place predicates obtained through the rule:",
