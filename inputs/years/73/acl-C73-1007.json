        "With this result we can state even the principle to formulate each grammatical transformation, which according to Chomsky is a mapping of phrase-markers into phrase-markers, as a nonlogical axiom in the following way: we describe both the applied phrase-markers and the resulting phrase-markers, or parts of them, with formulae in the language of predicate logic of first-order which occur then respectively as premises and conclusion of an implication formula.",
