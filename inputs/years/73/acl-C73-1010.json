        "The emergence of materially elaborated variants of generative description of languages has brought about a pragmatical question as to whether a particular generative grammar is working in such a way as it is assumed to be.",
        "This problem proved to be unsolvable by a linguist not aided by computer.",
        "Therefore, programmes started to be written, so as to enable the computers either a) to make a grammar work or b) to allow to find out - through a recognition procedure, e.g. changing the directions of arrows in all the rewriting rules - whether an initial S can really be reached when starting from assumed output strings.",
        "1.2.",
        "In the Computing Centre of Charles University, Prague, the former of the above methods of computer testing of generative grammars was selected - similarly as at the University of Michigan (J. FRIEDMAN, 1971) and at other research centres.",
        "Tests are being worked out for a certain variant of functional generative description of the Czech language (the author of its frame is P. SGALL).",
        "For the time being, the object of the testing is the generative component (GC) of this description enumerating semantic representations (SR's) of sentences.",
        "1.3.",
        "Before demonstrating the way in which the testing is carried out we shall give a brief outline of the basic properties of the GC of the functional generative description.",
        "For a more detailed characterization of this type of description see P. SGALL, et al.",
        "(1969).",
        "The GC is a context-free phrase structure grammar, i.e. a grammar of the type 2 in Chomsky's classification of grammars.",
        "Together with the theory of immediate constituents the dependency syntax finds its application in it.",
        "In the GC there are several types of context-free rules: modifying, substitutional and selectional ones.",
        "They are shown illustratively in Fig. 1, where U, V, W are auxiliary non-terminal symbols, u is a terminal symbol, r is some functor - terminal symbol indicating",
        "which of the two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side of the rule is the dependent one and which is the governing one as well as the type of dependency.",
        "For the sake of simplicity each of the terminal and non-terminal symbols is represented by a single letter.",
        "In the written form of the grammar, non-terminal symbols of the grammar are ordered (n 2)-tuples X, X0, X„ where X is the so-called name-symbol, i.e. a name shared by a certain class of non-terminal symbols, and X0, X„ are indices specifying individual non-terminal symbols of that class.",
        "Terminal symbols are characterized by a similar structure.",
        "From a linguistic point of view the name-symbols in terminal symbols correspond to the so-called lexemes, grammatemes and functors.",
        "For the time being the lexemes represent semoglyphs, their total number in the variant tested being 275.",
        "Thus this experiment ranks among those experiments operating with a \" lexicon \" of a small extent which is typical so far of most computer experiments with generative grammars.",
        "One name-symbol corresponds to the left bracket and one to the right one.",
        "A substitution of some units for others is often possible in Czech in certain contexts only.",
        "The GC meets this fact generally by introducing new, more refined categories specified by indices.",
        "The number of indices actually used differs with the individual name-symbols, the brackets and some other name-symbols having no indices at all.",
        "The maximum number of indices attached to one non-terminal name-symbol is 15; the maximum number of indices attached to one terminal name-symbol is 30; the maximum number of values of each individual index is 94 and the average number of values per one index is 8.",
        "The right-hand side of the rules in the GC is subject to certain restrictions, namely the right-hand side of the rules does not contain more than two non-terminal symbols.",
        "Hence we work with a binary context-free grammar.",
        "The GC contains recursive rules.",
        "The order of the rules applied is determined by the form of the rule itself and by a selection of non-terminal symbols.",
        "The rules are not distinguished as oblig"

        "However, the answer to the question whether it is necessary, or only possible, to use some rule in generating some SR. of a sentence is given by the form of the rules itself.",
        "To make the representation brief and to increase the legibility, rule-schemes are largely made use of.",
        "2.1.",
        "The form of grammar was maintained in a shape close to the original one, with which the linguists are used to work; it makes a good orientation in the grammar possible.",
        "Some modifications, however, were introduced.",
        "The values of the indices were coded with natural numbers and some designations were employed, such as so-called references, which make it possible to register only once the lists of index-values and even whole non-terminal symbols that occur more than once, and to refer to these values in other cases; they also make it possible to describe the fact that the value of some index is determined by a value of some other index, etc.",
        "These lists, symbols and values are usually referred to by means of references in the frame of a single rule-scheme so that these references do not cause any serious slowing down of the work of the programme and at the same time they save the storage space.",
        "The leftmost-derivation method is used, as well as a random choice of alternatives.",
        "It was, however, necessary to avoid, e.g., a repeated choice of some recursive rules, which would lead either to an excessive prolongation of the string generated, possibly without any transition to terminal symbols, or to a situation where the number of some types of SR's in the generated sample would be far removed from their actual frequency in the language.",
        "Therefore, the alternatives on the right-hand sides are not picked out simply at random but with a certain prescribed probability.",
        "As a consequence of the use of rule-schemes it is not possible to prescribe probabilities for the schemes of the right-hand sides as wholes only, and it is necessary to prescribe also probabilities for various values of indices used in these schemes.",
        "The prescribed probabilities make it possible to control the derivation of the SR's so as to make the generated sample contain, first of all, some strings of a particular type chosen a priori, which we intend to examine more closely.",
        "Thus it will be possible to change the set of the generated strings by means of a change of the probabilities prescribed.",
        "In other words: by a modification of probabilities of some subset of rules it will always be possible to meet the demand: \" Let the given phenomenon occur in SR's with much higher (or lower) frequency!",
        "\".",
        "However, an answer",
        "to the question: \" What will be the effect of a modification of the probability in the rule number n, upon the generation of SR's?",
        "\" can only be given after evaluating the further experiment of random generation in which the probability modification intended will be materialized.",
        "The programme makes use of a special subroutine to obtain pseudorandom numbers.",
        "An example of a modifying rule:",
        "8 = 0,1 means that this rule can be used when the value of index 8 with given non-terminal name-symbol is 0 or 1 $9 = 13 means that the rule can be used for non-terminal name-symbol VERBUM when index 9 either has the value 13 or is not used 40 a prescribed probability for choice of this alternative (other alternatives are not quoted here for this example) 0 = 9(20),10 means that in 20 % of cases the value 9 is to be chosen, in the rest of the cases the value 10 3 = L8 the value of index 3 with a non-terminal name-symbol NP will equal the value of index 8 of the rewritten non-terminal symbol LS reference; it means that at this place the whole left-hand side should be repeated (i.e. VERBUM with all its indices).",
        "Some quantitative characteristics of the tested variant: (The given average values are mere estimates based on partial calculations, exact values will be reached on the computer in the course of transducing the grammar into a form suitable for the work of the programme).",
        "The number of non-terminal name-symbols 62 the number of indices with one non-terminal name-symbol 15 max, 5 average"

        "E.g. when simulating a generation of a string of 13 symbols - containing 3 semoglyphs - 23 substitutions were carried out, which corresponds well to the estimation according to the method described above.",
        "We can thus estimate the number of readings from the external storage of the computer in the course of the generation of one string.",
        "The maximum length of a string will be determined by the dimension of the storage space declared for this string.",
        "The probabilities prescribed for the choice of the right-hand sides of the rules ensure that a premature finishing of the process of generation caused by exceeding a given length may occur only in exceptional cases.",
