        "Our purpose is to constitute a frequency dictionary of the different structures used in the language.",
        "This dictionary will enable us to select the most useful sentence structures in order to recommend their exclusive use for the writing of texts intended for automatic translation.",
        "We think that the automatic translation will be possible only if the texts are submitted to rules which limit the complexity of their syntax.",
        "These limitations will be the less noticed by an author as only the most unusual structures would have been left out.",
        "Of course the number of permitted structures will increase as the automatic translation codes are improved.",
        "The sentence structures are obtained by a statistical analysis of the word strings according to procedures developed in the information theory.",
        "In the present paper we have analysed only groups of two consecutive words as an example of our method.",
        "The same type of analysis can be generalized by considering non-consecutive words and groups of more than two words."

        "The sample chosen here (a novel by S. Maugham of 3500 words) is too short to obtain significant frequencies for the different structures.",

        "In spite of the simplicity of the method of analysis employed, 72 sentences of an average length of 10 words have been correctly analysed.",
        "This shows that the correlation of 2 consecutive words, although insufficient, will play an important part in the more elaborated methods of analysis that we are now developing."
