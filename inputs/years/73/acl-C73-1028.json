        "The feasibility study on fully automatic high quality translation was held in 1971 under the auspices of the Linguistics Research Center of The University of Texas at Austin with support from RAFB.",
        "The participants were twenty experts in the areas of linguistics and computer software, representing a wide range of opinions on the feasibility of MT.",
        "Among the recommendations made in the report on this study was one regarding the need of \" lexical research to determine the syntactic and semantic patterns of linguistic entities \".",
        "The result of such research would be a dictionary containing, in addition to lexical information, syntactic and semantic features and restrictors necessary for quality translation.",
        "In this paper, I would like to describe some of the work which is currently being done at the Linguistics Research Center toward such a dictionary.",
        "2.",
        "WORK AT THE CENTER 2.1.",
        "Approach.",
        "2.1.1.",
        "Purpose.",
        "The purpose of the dictionary is to provide the information which the grammar of a language can refer to in its rules to a) establish the wellformedness of a sentence, b) avoid forced reading, and",
        "c) recognize the semantic reading of each word in a particular context (for correct choice of one translation equivalent from a number of possibilities or for synonymy substitution in paraphrasing).",
        "This information should be as comprehensive as possible; on the other hand, it must still have manageable proportions.",
        "Our aim is to find the happy medium; our classification system constitutes a first modest step towards it.",
        "In general, the features we include in our lexicon reflect surface phenomena: there are several reasons for this approach.",
        "To begin with, the input text for any translation consists of surface strings; whatever information we need is present in these surface strings and must be recognized.",
        "Secondly, it will be simpler to recognize regularities and establish transformational relations as well as semantic classes once we have comparatively comprehensive lists of lexical items with all or at least most of their surface features.",
        "Any hypothesis can then be checked against this set of data.",
        "When we describe surface phenomena, we do not overlook distinctions like those between easy to please and eager to please or expect somebody to do something and advise somebody to do something, etc.",
        "These pairs of lexical items share only some surface environments, not all of them, a fact which we can recognize when we compare their descriptors, by inspection or mechanically.",
        "Further, a description of surface structure gives us the possibility of producing translations which are structurally similar to the input string if these are permissible and of similar stylistic value in the target language.",
        "In addition to surface features, our description includes some of the transformational features which are well established.",
        "For example, we mark verbs which cannot be passivized, English verbs which do not form the progressive, and adjectives which modify the verbal aspects of a noun rather than its full scope of meaning.",
        "Finally, we include in our lexical description some indications of functional relationships between surface and deep structures.",
        "These are based on a contrastive approach; they are included only for those sets of translation equivalents for which these relations are not identical.",
        "For example, the English verb fail takes a subject and a complement BEYOND THE FEASIBILITY STUDY: LEXICOGRAPHIC PROGRESS 325 both of which are basically the same in the surface and the deep structure.",
        "Its German translation, the verb mifigliicken, however, takes a subject which appears as a dative object in the surface, while the surface subject represents the deep object complement.",
        "This characteristic of the German verb is explicitly marked in our lexicon."

        "The method used at the Center for the compilation of its MT dictionaries consists of three steps:",
        "1) inclusion of information provided in existing dictionaries; 2) coding of carefully selected semantic and syntactic features; 3) interpretation of the information in the resulting lists and revision.",
        "Among the available dictionaries we found most useful are the German-English Dictionary by WILDHAGEN and HtRAUCOURT and The Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English by HORNBY, GATENBY and WAKEFIELD.",
        "Both of these dictionaries indicate the different readings of a lexical item separately, according to syntactic and/or semantic criteria.",
        "Therefore, our initial lists already contained a small amount of syntactic and semosyntactic information, such as human vs. non-human subjects or objects required by verbs: We began with the German and English verb lists primarily to find out the general types of selection restrictions of these verbs and to use this information as the basis of our classification of nouns and adjectives.",
        "In this way, we compiled the following lists: a) A German verb list with English translation equivalents.",
        "This list contains approximately 17,500 entries.",
        "Since the different readings of each keyword constitute separate entries, the list represents approximately 12,000 different verb stems.",
        "b) An English verb list, consisting of 6,500 verb stem entries.",
        "c) A German noun list with English translation equivalents, gender, and inflectional information.",
        "This list contains appr.",
        "73,000 entries; at present, appr.",
        "2,000 entries contain semosyntactic features.",
        "326 ANNETTE STACHOWITZ d) A bilingual adjective list of appr.",
        "27,000 entries, each consisting of an English keyword, its German translation equivalents, and subject area or stylistic descriptors.",
        "The addition of features to these entries is still in progress; approximately 12,000 items have been assigned features so far.",
        "e) An English-German adverb list which is still in the process of compilation.",
        "At present, it covers adverbs beginning with the letters A through R, totalling some 3,500 entries.",
        "Each entry consists of an English adverb, its German translation equivalents, and syntactic and semo-syntactic features as described under 2.4.5. in this paper.",
        "f) In addition to these lists of one-word entries, we have compiled bilingual lists of phrasal verbs.",
        "The lists are separated according to internal syntactic constituents :",
        "The second and current stage in the lexicographic work is the addition of syntactic and semo-syntactic features not explicitly given in the existing dictionaries but identified as essential by linguistic research of the past two decades.",
        "The information is being coded according to a general classification system, which I will touch on briefly later and for which we rely heavily on the intuition of native speakers.",
        "The third stage of our lexicographic work is the interpretation of the information contained in our lists.",
        "For this purpose, we produce concordances in which all lexical entries having a particular feature in common are listed together.",
        "Even more useful will be the sub-lists which our linguists can request - lists of all lexical entries with specific combinations of features, for example.",
        "English verbs which can take both BEYOND THE FEASIBILITY STUDY: LEXICOGRAPHIC PROGRESS 327 that-clauses and infinitive complements, or German reflexive verbs whose English translation is intransitive, etc.",
        "Inspection of such special sub-lists will, hopefully, reveal regularities and semantic subclasses which we can use to replace combinations of syntactic or semantic features and thus streamline the dictionary.",
        "Similarly, those features which can be predicted from the presence or absence of others will be deleted from the dictionary and introduced by lexical redundancy rules.",
        "An example would be a redundancy rule stating that all verbs which take for-to object complements require human subjects.",
        "The classification system according to which lexicographic work at the Center is being done is essentially the same for German and English.",
        "Some syntactic structures, however, apply only to one language.",
        "Basically, the system comprises three types of features: the properties of the classified element itself; the properties of the environment in which it may occur wellformedly; and information pertaining to the subject area to which a lexical element or one of its semantic readings might be restricted.",
        "a) The features of the element itself are its syntactic category, its possible discontinuous elements, such as separable verbal prefixes in German and adpreps in English, and its semantic sub-classification.",
        "b) The selection restriction of the classified element indicate the syntactic and semantic restrictions on obligatory and optional complements, mostly of verbs, adjectives, and prepositions, but also of some nouns and adverbs.",
        "The features of the lexical element and also its selection restrictions are indicated as values of subscripts, the latter being generalizations of the features.",
        "For example, TC(AB) stands for \" this verb requires an NP complement which is abstract \".",
        "Or, as in \" requires a human or abstract complement \" is indicated by a comma: TC(HU, AB).",
        "The comma also indicates ambiguity; for example, the English noun operator has the features TY(HU, AB), which is to be read as \" this noun is ambiguous; it is abstract in one reading, human in another \".",
        "Optionality of complements is expressed by the value LA (lambda) with a comma, as in FC(A, LA), which reads \" this verb (or adjective) takes an optional complement noun phrase in the accusative \".",
        "c) The additional restrictions consist at present mainly of tags indicating the subject area for those words which are restricted to or have, special usage in such areas as zoology, law, music, etc."

        "These are: title (for items like Mr., Dr., etc., which can be followed by proper names); name (for frequently occurring proper names); body part (because of verbs like amputate and because the German definite article preceding nouns denoting body parts is replaced by a possessive pronoun in English); machine (because many verbs which normally require a human subject can also take a machine as a subject); mass (because these may be used without an article in the singular); collective (because such nouns can be used with verbs which otherwise require plural subjects or subjects, as e.g. disperse : the crowd dispersed, they dispersed, but not *the man dispersed; in English such nouns are frequently referred to by plural pronouns: The government is in agreement; they are expected to release their decision soon.",
        "); quantity (for nouns like glass, half, per-BEYOND THE FEASIBILITY STUDY: LEXICOGRAPHIC PROGRESS 329 cent, dozen, etc., which can occur in the frame a (of) NP, where they act as the syntactic but not the semantic head of the noun phrase construction); time (a subclass of abstract; these nouns can take a when-relative clause); count (abstracts which are preceded by a definite article, such as idea, event, as opposed to those abstracts which may be used in the singular without an article, e.g. mathematics, love, etc.",
        "; the latter type is unmarked); unit (abstracts like mile, year, etc., which fit into the frame NP = QUANT the whole noun phrase being a quantitative adverb, as in five mites long; this allows us to analyze only these noun phrases as adverbs, instead of considering every NP a possible adverbial, which would cause a large number of incorrect readings).",

        "Examples are dependence (on), fact (that).",
        "The required syntactic form of such complements is indicated as that-clause, marked or unmarked infinitive, gerund, for-to phrase, interrogative adverb plus clause, specific prepositions, and possible combinations of these.",

        "The second verb feature which is not a selection restriction is \" type \", which only indicates, redundantly, whether the verb is transitive, intransitive, or reflexive; also indicated are the small classes of transitive verbs which may not be passivized and of English verbs which do not form the progressive.",
