        "In this paper we are going to explain some of the problems we have found in our attempts to mechanize the Historical Dictionary (D.H.) of the Spanish language.",
        "Our experimental project is a collaboration of the Royal Spanish Academy (R.A.E.)",
        "and the Computer Center of the University of Madrid (ccuM).",
        "There are, indeed, many procedures for making concordances of a text, and those procedures are, in general, very successful ones.",
        "We are not going to be concerned with concordance making; nevertheless, it seems obvious to declare that a good concordance system must be in the basis of our researches.",
        "We must suppose that in our concordances we get syntactically limited utterances, i.e. that in our concordances we do not have to deal with words belonging to sentences whose verbs are not included in the text given in the concordance.",
        "By now, the best method of getting this kind of concordances is to limit them by full stops.",
        "So, we get our text divided by full stops or semicolons and we analyze as many sentences as verbs could be included between those punctuation marks.",
        "But, and we must say it quickly, we are not dealing with complex sentences yet, on the contrary, we are analyzing rather simple structures of"

        "which means really that we are occupying ourselves with problems of determiners, inflectional endings, agreement or concord, etc., instead of dealing with word order problems.",
        "We are making some steps in semantic analysis too.",
        "Nobody shall expect, then, from our so clearly limitated work, any marvellous discovery.",
        "We have just proved that our IBM 7090, assisted by an IBM 1401 is able to analyze so simple a phrase as each of the components of the set of experiments you will see.",
        "We have written our programs in SNOBOL, a language specially indicated for the management of linguistic structures.",
        "One of the many problems of our SNOBOL compiler is its inadequacy to give the time used by the computer in performing its task, but we have calculated that for all the lecture, analysis and listing we show, it must be about three minutes.",
        "Our error message is HA FALLADO, which indicates that something has gone wrong since the beginning.",
        "Other error messages are LA PALABRA \" PALABRA\" NO ESTA EN NUESTRA TABLA, which means that we are using a word that does not exist in our lexicon (Table 1), ESTA FRASE NO FORMA ORACION, i.e. we",
        "have got a set of words without grammatical organization.",
        "As grammatical organization we understand our Table 2, \" grammar \".",
        "EL",
        "articles, substantives, and verbs; NO HAY COHERENCIA ENTRE SUJET° Y VERBO \" there is no sernantical agreement between subject and verb \", i.e., the features of the subject are not those demanded by the verb; LA PALABRA \" PALABRA\" ESTA MAL COLOCADA, meaning that we have a word out of place (referring always to our grammar); EL SUSTANTIVO NO CONCUERDA CON EL ARTICULO \" there is no equivalent among the grammatical features of the article and those of the substantive \", and NO HAY COHERENCIA ENTRE COMPLEMENTO Y VERBO \" the semantic features of the object are not those demanded by the verb \".",
        "Our success message is LA FRASE ESTA BIEN CONSTRUIDA (\" the sentence is a grammatical one \"); if there has been a semantic disagreement in the analysis, but not a grammatical one we get A PESAR DE ELLO LA FRASE ESTA BIEN CONSTRUIDA (in spite of our signalled semantic disagreement the sentence is well built).",
        "With this innovation we are trying to research on the domain of apparent incoherences like metaphors.",
        "For instance, we establish that the verb HABLAR \" to speak \" requires the feature + HUMAN in the subject, so if we get EL PERRO HABLO \" the dog spoke \" our message got will be \" there is no semantic agreement between subject and verb \": \" dog \" is – HUMAN; but, in spite of that, we do not stop our analysis and at the end we obtain \" in spite of that the sentence is well built \", which assures us that the sentence is grammatical to a lesser degree than another one with total agreement.",
        "The computer makes substitutions beginning at the left side; if there is no agreement it emits the corresponding error message, and if this disagreement is of a grammatical kind it stops.",
        "A part of our lexicon is included in the listing, in which it may be seen that the first feature belongs to the grammatical analysis, and the rest to the semantic one.",
        "So PEDRO is a substantive, masculine, singular, on the grammatical side, and animated, intelligent, on the semantic side.",
        "The verb COME \" eats \" is a transitive verb, which needs an animated subject and a solid object.",
        "It seems fair to declare that till now we were much more concerned about syntactic problems than about those of morphology.",
        "So, we operated with verbs in the third person singular.",
        "Now we are trying to build a morphology which will permit us to apply our analysis to a broader field.",
        "We reproduce here a listing of one of our experiments."
