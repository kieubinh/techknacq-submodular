        "This ALS-Division of natural language systems provides two groups of words: a) words representing nouns, verbs and adjectives as so called Â« content words or more easily nominated as RADICALS and b) words expressing syntactic features and functions, the SYNTAX-PARTICLES.",
        "While the human treasure of knowledge in form of meanings expressed by content-words is in no way curtailed by ALS-Rules, the vast jungle of still existing syntactical features and syntagms will be drastically cooked down to the essentials.",
        "Thus the ALS-Rules comprehend several laws to limit syntagms, which are made clear by algorithms or verbal definitions.",
        "Still the limitations enforced by ALS-Rules are based on language universals and thus keep all information-expressions and performances in the scope of a natural language system.",

        "While English, French, German and Russian belong to systems of agglutinated morphologies - the morphological structures are glued together - Chinese, ideographic-, pictographic and gesture language systems bear an isolated one.",

        "Up to fifty or more existing different language systems can be considered as morphologically and syntactically differentiated expression - and carrier - systems for only one and the very same information treasure, the treasure of human knowledge.",

        "In order to unify and subsequently limit especially the number of existing syntagms, it pays off to be very careful when making artificial curtailments.",
        "The best way still is to lean on natural prototypes, which lead back to the Bloom-fieldian division (L. BLOOMFIELD, 1935, p. 208):",
        "Consequently it becomes convenient to disregard segment A of Fig. 1 entirely and look more into details of segment B. Syntagms, limited down by their nature in language expression systems of segment B are easier to pinpoint.",
        "The vast jungle of syntagms in segment A hinders the extraction of those syntagms which are of most significance concerning language universals.",

        "The number of possible syntactic algorithms to construct sentences in all existing natural languages is finite, but still at the present state uncontrollable \" and thus not computable (G. SALTON, 1968, p. 191).",

        "Even if limited in syntactic patterns, natural language systems are easy to employ because of being available and programmed already in the brains of human beings.",
        "Interpreting the criteria for natural language systems (J. H. GREENBERG, 1968, p. 110 if), it is trivial to realize that certain systems, up to now mostly out of regard, deliver contributions of syntactical features highly valuable for the whole enterprise.",
        "Those syntactical features of limited but natural expression systems are mainly extracted from language systems of isolated morphology as shown in Fig. 3, e to m. But the entire operation to limit syntagms and form algorithms must be stopped by one certain point, which prevents it from crossing the boundaries from natural to artificial language systems (Fig.",
