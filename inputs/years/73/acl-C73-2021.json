        "The task of the MasA is to elaborate a system for analysing simple sentences of present-day-German. \"",

        "The scope of the analysis.",
        "The team works on the basis of a so-called verb grammar.",
        "In this type of grammar the verb represents the nucleus of a sentence, thus being opposed to the subject-predicate-grammar.",
        "Proposals for the elaboration of such a grammar have been presented by Helbig-Schenke1,1 Heringer 2 and Enge1.8 This type of grammar is based on a verb lexicon, which describes all the obligatory and facultative objects that depend on the verb, e.g. treffen with two obligatory objects in Ich treffe ihn morgen",
        "treffen with one obligatory object and one facultative object in Er trifft (den Ball) treffen auf with two obligatory objects in Die Mannschaft traf auf einen schwachen Gegner.",
        "After having detected the number of both the obligatory and facultative objects and specified these objects according to their syntactical functions, one can group the verbs into classes, e.g. the class of all the verbs with one obligatory object (this class contains for example the verb laufen), the class of all the verbs with two obligatory objects (containing for example treffen), the class of all the verbs with three obligatory objects (containing for example anbieten), the class of all the verbs with one obligatory and one facultative object (containing for example treffin), and so on.",
        "Each of these classes represents a so-called \" Satzbauplan\" (SBP).4 The systematic levels of the grammar are a) the word class-level (WK-level) b) the group-level (noun group (NG), verbal group (VG)) c) the complex-level (noun complex (NK), verb complex (VX)) d) the object-level (nominative object (00), genitive object (02), ...).",
        "The following graph can be regarded as an illustration of these four systematic levels: 5",

        "The word classes are defined by the following morphological and/or syntactical properties: Prepositions are collected in a catalogue and specified by their position (in front of, behind, in front of or behind, in front of and behind the nucleus of a NG), by their government (accusative, genetive, dative) and by the sort of object that is introduced by the preposition (prepositional object, situative object, directional object).",
        "Adverbs are listed, and the list only includes words that meet the following conditions: non-inflexional; no predicative use; certain regularities of position.",
        "Non-inflected adjectives are not listed; they are described by an algorithm, which is to find out the degree of comparison.",

        "There exists an algorithm that provides the description of those words according to case, number, and gender?",
        "In general, the definition of the several word classes is the common one, as found in the traditional grammars.",
        "But there are two exceptions : the so-called determinantia and the pronouns.",
        "The so-called determinantia are listed in a catalogue; they are grouped with respect to the possible arrangements of several determinantia within a NG, e.g. vor alien diesen meinen sch√§nen Biichern.",
        "The results of having found out certain regularities are both a number of distinct subclasses of determinantia and the formulation of context-sensitive rules for analysing arrangements of determinantia.",
        "First, there are 10 subclasses, namely",

        "The rules mentioned above can be illustrated by the diagram on the next page The pronouns are considered as pro-forms of a NG with a nominal nucleus.",
        "A part of the pronouns can be grouped in several subclasses according to three significant features: possibility of using a preposition in front of the pronoun, possibility of putting determinantia in front of the pronoun, possibility of using a genitive or prepositional attribute in the post-nuclear field.",

        "These pronouns do not differ at the NG- or NK-level.",
        "But they differ at the 0-level, when you try to detect if such a pronoun is a substitute for an object (depending on the verb) or a substitute for a so-called \"Angabe \" (which does not depend on a verb).11 Furthermore, pronouns that can be substitutes for an object, can be differentiated according to the kind of these objects.",
        "So, there are six more subclasses, namely",
        "Pronouns of PRON7A are substitutes for prepositional objects (04); pronouns of PRON7B are substitutes for situative objects (05) ; pronouns of PRON7C are substitutes for directional objects (06); pronouns of PRON7D are substitutes for 04 or 05; pronouns of PRON7E are substitutes for 04 or 06; pronouns of PRON8 are substitutes for so-called \" Angaben \".",
        "The final division of pronouns in 15 subclasses makes it possible to set up rules for detecting and describing NGs with a pronominal nucleus.",
        "For the demonstration of these rules we will use a simplified and abbreviated notation.",
        "11 The reason for these pronouns not being included in PRON1 (which meets the same conditions at the first glance) is that man of PRON1 covers always the position of a nominative object (Op), in contrast to the pronouns of PRON7A to PRON8.",
        "This collection of rules shows the difference between PRON1 PRON6 and PRON7 A ... PRON8.",
        "A comparison with the rules R1 to R5 illustrates that there are less possibilities to combine determinantia in front of the nucleus of a pronominal NG.",

        "The reason is quite evident: by suppressing the noun (nucleus) in a nominal NG, the last determinans turns into a pronoun, i.e. it represents the nucleus in a pronominal NG.",
        "Compare the following two examples:",
        "There is another difference beween a nominal NG and a pronominal one: in nominal NGs one can find other NGs embedded: die Ansprachen haltenden Parlamentarier, or (rather complex) die nach Marx alle menschlichen Handlungen wesentlich and zu aller Zeit zum Nachteil der Mehrheit der Bevolkerung bestim-menden Kapitalgesetze.",
