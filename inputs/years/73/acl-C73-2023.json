        "This paper describes a programme which, by means of a very limited number of criteria, analyses French sentences into principal clauses and subordinate clauses.",
        "We prefer, however, to speak of segmentation rather than of analysis, because the analysis in question is very incomplete; there is, so to speak, no analysis at all; what we are doing is simply to try to find the extent to which the computer, using only a few kinds of landmarks in the text, is able to divide the sentence into certain segments, viz. the clauses.",
        "We raise the question whether French sentences can be segmented correctly by the computer recognizing in the input-text as linguistic signs having a special value, only words of the following three types:",
        "1) finite verb-forms, 2) conjunctions and relative pronouns, 3) punctuation marks.",
        "All other words are considered as belonging to a single class, the unmarked words.",
        "In practice we shall make some subdivisions within the three main groups so that we finally get eight classes of signs in the input-text between which the computer should be able to distinguish: 1) words introducing subordinate clauses (subordinating conjunctions, relative pronouns); 2) coordinating conjunctions (et, mais, ou); 3) comma; 4) unmarked words, i.e. every word not belonging to any of the other classes; 5) finite verb without clitic subject pronoun + clitic pronouns and particles; 6) full stop, semicolon, colon, exclamation-mark, question-mark.",
        "7) \" car''; 8) finite verb with a clitic subject pronoun + clitic pronouns and particles.",
        "As will be seen, the computer will not, as a rule, try to identify the subject of the clause.",
        "Preliminary experience has shown us, however, that we could diminish considerably the number of errors by conserving the information given by the existence, or non-existence, of a clitic subject pronoun before the finite verb.",
        "We find that information of this kind is of the same type as the other \" landmarks \", i.e. word-forms that one can identify fairly easily without going very far in the analysis of the context.",
        "2.",
        "Survey of the different stages of the project.",
        "The first part of the programme converts the input-text into a string of symbols (the numbers of the eight classes just defined).",
        "Example : c'est l'heure dangereuse ou le froid, si on n'est pas convert, vous rend nialade.",
        "8 4 4 4 1 4 4 3 1 8 4 4 3 5 4 6 The conversion programme, which should be the first to operate on the text, is nevertheless the last to be elaborated and, at present, it is still not operative in its entirety.",
        "At the first stage of our work, we made the conversion manually, wanting to see the efficiency of our parser before undertaking the rather tiresome work of writing the conversion-programme.",
        "Therefore, the segmentations presented in this paper are all segmentations of manually written strings of numbers which correspond to some French sentences; but, indeed, when writing these input-strings, we were careful to do only what our conversion programme should be able to make the computer do.",
        "Although the conversion programme does not pretend to any degree of originality, it might be useful to give some idea of the amount of analysis contained in it; this point might be essential to the discussion of the interest of the entire project.",
        "The conversion programme consists mainly of the following subsections: a) segmentation of the input-text into sentences and words.",
        "This programme especially examines the puntuation marks (in order, for instance, to find out whether a point is a full stop or something else), the hyphens, and the apostrophes; both hyphens and apostrophes may, or may not, separate words.",
        "b) Conversion of the punctuation marks into one of the two symbols, 3 or 6."

        "c) Conversion of highly-frequent grammatical words (82 different words are listed) into the symbols 2 or 7 or into the symbols that represent two auxiliary classes.",
        "Apart from the eight classes taken over by the parser, we have set up, for the purpose of the conversion only, two auxiliary classes: determiners (for the purpose of disambiguating homographs that may be either nouns or finite verb-forms) and prepositions (on account of the possibility that they form part of a relative-phrase introducing a subordinate clause).",
        "d) Conversion of finite verbs into one of the two symbols, 5 or 8.",
        "This routine is undoubtedly the most important part of the conversion programme.",
        "It examines every word from right to left in order to see whether the ending of the word matches with an entry in the list of verb-flexives.",
        "If the answer is in the affirmative, the routine will try to match the remainder of the token with an entry in the list of stems.",
        "This list comprises about 3200 stems which correspond to the verbs selected as those belonging to ordinary French in J. CAPUT, Dic-tionnaire des verbes Francais, Larousse 1970. e) Conversion into the symbol 1 of the words introducing subordinate clauses.",
        "f) Conversion into the symbol 4 of every word for which the previous tests have failed.",
        "The second part of the programme, the segmentation programme proper, analyses the string of numbers and gives as an output a string segmented in the following way (we take as an example the sentence quoted above): input: 8444144318443546 output: 8444/ 1443/ 546 18443/ The oblique strokes indicate the boundaries of the clauses.",
        "We have introduced, however, the convention that a single stroke is not a boundary if followed at the same level by a space and a string which is not preceded by a stroke.",
        "In our example, this is the case at the second level where, as a matter of fact, there is only one clause: c'est l'heure dangereuse/ at le froidl vous rend m. si on n'est pas convert' 280 BENTE MAEGAARD - EBBE SPANG-HANSSEN The output does not only give information about the boundaries of the clauses; it also indicates the levels of the clauses and the ways in which they are embedded in one another.",
        "In our example it is easy to see that the clause at the lowest level is embedded in the clause at the second level which, in turn, is subordinated to the clause at the top level.",
        "It is evident that it is only a simple matter of programming to convert the output-string consisting of numbers into an image of the segmented sentence.",
        "This conversion, too, will be included in the final system.",

        "If the programme turns out to be reasonably successful - that is to say if the automatic conversion of the text into symbols will not increase too much the number of errors-one might think of two possible applications: The programme might be useful for obtaining more interesting concordances.",
        "The computer has often been thought of as a means for the linguist of obtaining better documentation than that of the old-fashioned card-index made manually by the linguist himself; but if the computer is to replace the old card-index, the linguist must have the opportunity not only to give to the machine a list of words in which he is interested, but also to define for the machine the kinds of context in which the keywords should occur.",
        "A programme that recognizes the boundaries of the clauses should offer a good many possibilities for defining the contexts that the linguist is looking for.",
        "Another possible application of the segmentation programme might be as a first stage of a complete analysis.",
        "It might be profitable to start analysis with a tentative segmentation of the sentences into clauses.",
        "For us, however, the linguistic interest proper of the project is more important than the rather hypothetical applications, even though it seems quite clear that our grammar does not give a better understanding of the structure of the French sentence than that which could be found in a traditional grammar.",
        "Our grammar does not give any insight into the deep structure of the sentence, but it gives a description of the profile of the surface structure.",
        "One might speak of it as an investigation of some surface-constraints in French.",
        "It is not without interest to examine the extent to which it is true that French sentences are cast in a certain mould so that only a few marks are sufficient for a correct segmentation.",
        "Or to put it more simply: the segmentation programme can be seen as a new approach to the study of word-order in French.",
        "In this section we will discuss the linguistic facts that make possible a segmentation solely on the basis of the finite verb-forms, the conjunctions, and the punctuation marks.",
        "We have found it convenient to set up the rule that every finite verb constitutes a clause, that is to say there can be only one finite verb in a clause.",
        "This view is linguistically justifiable, for instance within the framework of a dependency grammar.",
        "Consequently, we shall say that there are two clauses in each of the following sentences: La voiture demarre et part en vitesse La voiture &mane, part en vitesse.",
        "In general, it is fairly easy to identify the beginning of a subordinate clause.",
        "It is a striking peculiarity of the French language that every (or nearly every) subordinate clause is introduced by some kind of introductory word, a conjunction or the like.",
        "Or to put it otherwise: the first word in a subordinate clause is always a word that belongs to a very limited class and one which it is rather easy to recognize (subordinating conjunctions, relative pronouns).",
        "Some of these words can play other roles as well (for instance si, combien), but the ambiguities are relatively few or unimportant.",
        "It is much more difficult to find out where the subordinate clauses end.",
        "It is perhaps one of the merits of our model that it puts that question - until now, as far as we know, grammarians have almost exlusively treated the beginning of the subordinate clauses.",
        "There is no problem, of course, if the end of the subordinate clause coincides with the end of the sentence; the real problem arises with the embedded clauses.",
        "Normally, the information contained in our strings of numbers is sufficient for the identification of the end of the embedded clauses on account, above all, of the fact that the subordinate clauses are most often embedded before the verb of the dominating clause (i.e. a clause that contains a subordinate clause - a subordinate as well as a principal clause may be a dominating clause): le yin qu'il boit est tres fort le yin qu'il boit le soir est tres fort."

        "In a string such as 4 4 1 4 5 4 4 4 5 6 where \" 1 indicates the beginning of an embedded clause, one can safely put the final boundary of this clause just before the second \" 5 (finite verb).",
        "This observation, which does not seem to be a matter of course, can be stated in the following way in terms of traditional grammar: if you insert a clause just after the subject, you cannot insert anything more before the verb-phrase.",
