        "This system for automated morphological analysis of ancient Greek had its origin in a practical need rather than a theoretical concern for natural language parsing.",
        "Our immediate goal was to develop a new textbook and curriculum for teaching ancient Greek to American university students.",
        "Most traditional methods assume that a student is willing to spend at least one year in the study of grammar before reading any significant quantity of literature.",
        "Our conviction is that students can begin reading literature very early in the first year if the initial grammatical instruction is focused on those features of the language which actually occur in the texts first read.",
        "To test this theory, we have used the computer to help produce a complete lexical and grammatical analysis of 40,000 words of ancient Greek selected from texts which students might wish to read in their first year.",
        "We have concentrated our attention initially on morphological analysis since the complexity of Greek morphology is the major obstacle to learning the language.",
        "We have prepared statistical summaries of the morphology of each text, as well as complete concordances organized both according to dictionary lemma and morphological category.",
        "Although our first goal is to collect information for a textbook, it is obvious that an automated system for morphological analysis will have uses far beyond the teaching of elementary Greek."

        "The program is able to identify most",
        "Greek words automatically, but we always examine carefully the resulting analysis and make provision for correcting and supplementing it manually wherever necessary.",
        "No prior editing of the text is required; the program will accept any Greek text which includes the normal diacritical signs (accents, breathing marks, and iotas subscript).",
        "The words are analyzed in the order in which they appear in the text without being sorted into alphabetical order.",
        "Each word is first examined to determine whether it occurs in a list of exceptional forms.",
        "If the word is found in this list, it is not subjected to further analysis.",
        "This list, which we call the in-declinable list, contains forms which are not inflected (prepositions, adverbs, particles, etc.)",
        "as well as forms whose inflection is highly irregular.",
        "The list currently contains about 800 entries.",
        "Roughly 50% of the words in a typical text are found in this list.",
        "Words not in the indeclinable list must be analyzed according to the rules of Greek morphology.",
        "Since the analytical procedure has refinements peculiar to Greek, it cannot be understood without some knowledge of how Greek nouns and verbs are inflected.",

        "The present active indicative of the verb ypdcpco write is conjugated: ypc'ccp-co, yp&cp-scc, ypdap-ec, etc.",
        "The task of analyzing such forms is simply one of segmenting the word into a stem and an ending.",
        "The program first removes the final letter of the word and determines whether that letter appears in the table as an inflectional ending.",
        "If it does, the remainder of the word is tentatively assumed to be a stem, and a search is made for this stem in the dictionary.",
        "If the stem exists and is consistent with the ending, the program identifies this as one possible analysis.",
        "The program then continues by searching for longer endings.",
        "Each possible combination of stem and ending must be examined since the word may be ambiguous.",
        "In some cases the original juncture between stem and ending is obscured by phonological changes.",
        "The verb clyourOcco ' love was originally conjugated with the same endings as ypOtcpw: ecyour&-w, dcyocrac-eLq, Ocycerc&-et, etc., but in the standard literary dialect of Athens (Attic) the adjacent vowels contract, giving the following forms: Ocyarc65, ayocr*, clyouth,i, etc.",
        "We treat these contracted forms as a separate conjugation with a separate set of endings, even though this produces a false division between stem and ending: cyan-W, ckyocn*, ckyour-a, etc.",
