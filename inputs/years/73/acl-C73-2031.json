        "We are now ready to test conversion rules written as generative rules or instructions of different kinds.",
        "We will discuss alternative solutions at some points.",
        "We distinguish between two blocks of rules:",
        "I) fusion rules, which insert position words and introduce syntactic structure; II) lexical rules, which substitute words (simple numerals) for figures (digits).",
        "Ia) Fusion rules.",
        "Count number of digits in decimal representation and mark positions.",
        "The (maximum) number of positions (digits) is determined by the position of the leftmost digit which is not zero (0 0).",
        "hundra after pos.",
        "3. do after pos.",
        "2 Apply the rules until all groups of digits have been dissolved (interspersed by position words).",
        "Determine positions anew for each group of digits.",
        "Normally the maximum position word is inserted, but as mentioned before prices and years may be different, if between 1100-1999, which is taken into account in the rules.",
        "Instead of recursive application of the rules, compound position words such as tiotusen, hundratusen could be inserted (under certain conditions).",
        "As an alternative we might use the following procedure, which has some advantages when rules of pronunciation and rules for separating and combining numerals are to be formulated.",
        "It is based on deep structure rules 3b (above) which assumes the division of high numbers into 3-groups (in Swedish often marked by space already).",
        "Count number of digits and divide into 3-groups starting from right.",
        "Count number of 3-groups.",
        "Mark the groups starting from right.",
        "insert milliarder after the group, if the group is > 1, else insert milliard",
        "Apply the rules in order, repeatedly if necessary, until all digits have been processed.",
        "As observed before, the elements tiolton are always joined with the preceding number and treated as suffixes (-ton numbers take the grave accent).",
        "This phenomenon is related to the lengthening of t in Holton (sjutton, sjuttio, nitton etc.).",
        "We have treated this as allomorphic choice (not by phonological rules) assuming allomorphs of tre, sju, nio ending in t. In a traditional generative grammar (meeting demands of economy and simplicity) the doubling of t should be handled by the same rule (dental gemination) that gives bott from bot (participle of bo) and bldtt from bld t (neuter of bld).",
        "We have introduced + do and + ton in our rules with the plus to be used (as internal juncture) for special purposes.",
        "There might be better ways of handling the situation; it is depending on how pronunciation and orthographic conventions are to be handled.",
        "We have some use of the plus sign, but have to delete it in some cases.",
        "In the rule that deletes en (ett) before do (to avoid the impossible ett-tio) we also delete the plus sign.",
        "This gives the resultant do the right status, and it is not treated as a suffix in e.g. hundratio.",
        "Notice that the o in tio can only be deleted (optionally) in the suffix do (femti(o), sjutti(o)), not in cases such as hundratio where do is stressed.",
        "The fusion rules do what human beings do when they face a string of digits.",
        "System (Ia) corresponds roughly to a procedure, where the person counts the number of digits to get an idea how many tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, hundred thousands, millions etc.",
        "are in the number, the order of magnitude.",
        "Fusion rules Ib correspond to what is done by a person who divides the string of digits into 3-groups (if this is not done already), counts the number of 3-groups to find out whether the number is in the thousands, millions, milliards etc.",
        "Estimation of numerousness is easily handled in a glimpse if the number is five or less.",
        "Longer strings need counting.",
        "Division into groups of three digits is a practical method, which facilitates determination of the size of the number (see B. SIGURD, 1972).",
        "444 BENGT SIGURD 5.",
        "FROM SWEDISH INTO MATHEMATICAL REPRESENTATION Let us now outline a system which is the reverse of the previous conversion system.",
        "Again we distinguish between two blocks of rules: I) lexical rules which identify numerals and substitute digits for them;",
        "II) fusion rules which identify the position words tusen, hundra etc.",
        "; delete these words using their information for placing the digits in proper positions.",
        "We might call these rules positioning rules.",
        "In addition a zero insertion rule is needed.",
        "Zeros must be inserted at all empty places in the decimal representation.",
        "We will apply the lexical rules first, but the reversed order or mixed order may have advantages.",
        "tjugoftm 2 tio fern (---> 2 tio 5) tolvtusen ---> 1 tio 2 tusen (tretton – >) 3 ton – > 1 tio 3 femhundratio femhundra 1 tio (-± 5 hundra 1 tio)",
        "Apply the rules in order until all substitutable items have been changed.",
        "The examples show, within brackets, previous or following applications of rules.",
        "Insert 0 in empty positions Rules IIb operate on the 3-groups mentioned above and derive the position of the groups and the position of the digits within the groups in two steps.",
        "We will not dwell on the details any more.",
        "Implementation on computer will determine which analysis is preferable taking the properties of the computer, programming language, storage etc.",

        "We do not have such minimal pairs in Swedish because 10 is represented by ton after the units in the teens, and by ti(o) before the units in the other cases.",
        "We note that traditional morphemic analysis cannot reasonably treat ton and ti (o) as allomorphs in Swedish, since they contrast as in femtio :_femton (cf. C.-CH.",
