        "In current procedures for the detection of homographs two alternatives can be differentiated: i) Homographs are identified like monosemic word forms by segmentation and looking up in the standard lexicon.",
        "Homographs are detected, if segments of text word forms correspond with more than one lexicon-entry.",
        "Lexicon-entries representing homographic items therefore need no special marking.",
        "ii) Homographs are identified by means of a special homograph dictionary, which can be worked out in two versions:",
        "1) the homograph dictionary contains the graphemic shapes of all homographic word forms (full forms) and their possible linguistic specifications.",
        "In this case no segmentation procedures are required.",
        "2) the dictionary does not contain full forms but only the respective canonical forms.",
        "A special marking gives information about other corresponding dictionary-entries and the extent of their overlapping.",
        "In both cases (1) and (2) the identification of homographic text word forms is separated from the identification of monosemic ones.",
        "Procedures (i) and (ii) have some characteristic advantages and defects, which I will consider rather briefly.",
        "1.2.",
        "As already pointed out the first method requires (1) a segmen-tational algorithm, with the help of which the word forms of a text can be parsed into segments (e.g. stems and inflectional affixes), (2) an identificational component composed of a grapheme-sequence-comparing algorithm and the standard lexicon; thus it can be checked, whether a text segment detected by (1) is the expression-side of one (or perhaps more) lexical unit(s).",
        "If this is the case, the content-side(s) of the corresponding unit(s) can be assigned to the text segment.",
        "1.2.1.",
        "According to this conception the identification of word forms would offer no problems in the following cases:",
        "i) the word form represents only one sequence of segments (is monosemic), that means that each segment corresponds to one lexicon-entry :",
        "ii) The word form can be parsed into more than one set of segments (is homographic), and the possible readings show coinciding segment-boundaries:",
        "If the detected segments are compared with all graphematically corresponding lexicon-entries, that is, if the lexicon-look-up is not stopped after the first correspondence, this case can also easily be coped with.",
        "If the entries are arranged in alphabetical order, the respective units will immediately succeed one another.",
        "1.2.2.",
        "The detection becomes difficult however, if one word form is parsed into more than one set of segments (is homographic), while the segment-boundaries in the possible readings are overlapping:",
        "As the segments which have thus been detected do not coincide graphematically (e.g. /trieb/ - fgetriebe/), i.e., as the respective lexicon-entries are to be found at different places in the lexicon, for the identification of such homographs enormous parsing - and comparing procedures are required.",
        "As cases of homography with overlapping segment-boundaries in the various readings are encountered quite frequently in languages with extensive inflection (e.g. German, French, Russian), method 1.1.",
        "(i) is not the best in any case.",
        "1.2.3.",
        "The advantage of this method is above all to be seen in the fact that the identification of homographs can be managed automatically, and that no special marking of the respective entries is necessary.",
        "This is especially important with regard to dynamic lexical systems, where the number of lexicon-entries and their specification can vary; new entries do not require a change of the detection procedure.",
        "The disadvantage consists in the fact that monosemic and ambiguous word forms are submitted to the same procedure, which amounts to an undue delay of the determination of monosemic word forms.",
        "Multiple parsing with subsequent lexicon-look-up has always to be applied if the respective text word forms contain grapheme sequences, which correspond to inflectional affixes.",
        "Only after this can it be found out whether more than one plausible reading has resulted:",
        "Germ.",
        ": ...0getrieben0... -/trieb/-1-/ge-en/ treiben fgetriebeid-/n/ Getriebe or only one reading is true: Germ.",
        ": ...0gelagen0... -fgelagei-kinf Gelage but not: ilagf-Hge-en/ liegen 1.3.",
        "Method 1.1.",
        "(ii) does not have this disadvantage.",
        "Homographs are separately registered and marked according to their readings; thus a considerable acceleration of the identificational procedure is made possible.",
        "Monosemic word forms, the stems of which are listed up in the standard lexicon, are identified more easily, as the segmentation and lexicon-look-up can already be stopped after assignment of one reading.",
        "Ambiguous word forms are specified more easily, as the extensive segmentation and comparing-procedures do not have to be applied (as the various readings are registered in the homograph dictionary - version 1.1.",
        "(ii) (1) -) or are reduced to a minimum (as the respective lexicon-entries bear a special marking, by which their homography can be derived - version (ii) (2) -).",
        "These advantages however entail certain disadvantages: as a rule homograph dictionaries are built up manually and have to be manually complemented, when the standard lexicon is extended; the same has to be stated for the marking of lexicon-entries.",
        "Aside from this troublesome and time-consuming business one cannot be sure that all homographies are registered or are marked exhaustively."

        "ii) The graphemic shape belonging to the stem of paradigm P1, concatenated with a sequence Gk, is homographic with the stem of paradigm P2: Gs (P1)X GI, Gs(P2).",

        "iv) Gif for its part must be co-occurring with the respective stem of the paradigm: Gif Gif(Pi).",

        "Conditions (i) and (ii) determine the selection of stems.",
        "(iii) prevents that all partially homographic stems in the lexicon are selected and examined.",
        "Thus - for example - a coordination of the German stems /arm/ Arm and /armee/ Armee is not permitted (though they are fulfilling condition (ii): (P1) x /...ee/ Gs(P2)), as the sequence Gk = /...ee/ does not fulfill the condition GI, g_.",

        "(iii) and (iv).",
        "As the inflection-class-markings of stems and affixes (which are similar) are shortened distributional classifications, it is obvious to bring them into a system, according to the respective specifications of Gk.",
        "A matrix is built up by which it can be seen whether a Gk specification restricts the coordination of stems with certain inflection-classmarkings.",
        "In this way the detailed examination and comparison of all co-occurring affixes (in accordance to condition 2.3.",
