        "Here is the essence of the frame theory: When one encounters a new situation (or makes a substantial change in one's view of a problem), one selects from memory a structure called a frame.",
        "This is a remembered framework to be adapted to fit reality by changing details as necessary.",
        "A frame is a data-structure for representing a stereotyped situation like being in a certain kind of living room or going to a child's birthday party.",
        "Attached to each frame are several kinds of information.",
        "Some of this information is about how to use the frame.",
        "Some is about what one can expect to happen next.",
        "Some is about what to do if these expectations are not confirmed.",
        "We can think of a frame as a network of nodes and relations.",
        "The \"top levels\" of a frame are fixed, and represent things that are always true about the supposed situation.",
        "The lower levels have many terminals -- \"slots\" that must be filled by specific instances or data.",
        "Each terminal can specify conditions its assignments must meet.",
        "(The assignments themselves are usually smaller \"subframes.\") Simple conditions are specified by markers that might require a terminal assignment to be a person, en object of sufficient value, or a pointer to a subframe of a certain type.",
        "More complex conditions can specify relations among the things assigned to several terminals.",
        "Collections of related frames are linked together into frame-systems.",
        "The effects of important actions are mirrored by transformations between the frames of a system.",
        "These are used to make certain kinds of calculations economical,, to represent changes of emphasis and attention, and to account for the effectiveness of \"imagery.\" - For visual scene analysis, the different frames of a system describe the scene from different viewpoints, and the transformations between one frame and another represent the effects of moving from place to place.",
        "For non-visual kinds of frames, the differences between the frames of a system can represent actions, cause-effect relations, or changes in conceptual viewpoint.",
        "Different frames of a system share the same terminals; this is the critical point that makes it possible to coordinate information gathered from different viewpoints.",
        "Much of the phenomenological power of the theory hinges on the inclusion of expectations and other kinds of presumptions.",
        "A frame's terminals are normally already filled with \"default\" assignments.",
        "Thus, a frame may contain a great many details whose supposition is not specifically warranted by the situation.",
        "These have many uses in representing general information, most likely cases, techniques for bypassing \"logic,\" and ways to make useful generalizations.",
        "The default assignments are attached loosely to their terminals, so that they can be easily displaced by new items that fit better the current situation.",
        "They thus can serve also as \"variables\" or as special cases for \"reasoning by example,\" or as \"textbook cases,\" and often make the use of logical quantifiers unnecessary.",
        "The frame-systems are linked, in turn, by an information retrieval network.",
        "When a proposed frame cannot be made to fit reality -- when we cannot find terminal assignments that suitably match its terminal marker conditions -- this network provides a replacement frame.",
        "These inter-frame structures make possible other ways to represent knowledge about facts, analogies, and other information useful in understanding.",
        "Once a frame is proposed to represent a situation, a matching process tries to assign values to each frame's terminals, consistent with the markers at each place.",
        "The matching process is partly controlled by information associated with the frame (which includes information about how to deal with surprises) and partly by knowledge about the system's current goals.",
        "There are important uses for the information, obtained when a matching process fails; it can be used to select an alternative frame that better suits the situation."

        "At the level of detecting elementary visual features, texture elements, stereoscopic and motion-parallax cues, it is obvious that parallel processing might be useful.",
        "At the level of grouping features into objects, it is harder to see exactly how to use parallelism, but one can at least conceive of the aggregation of connected \"nuclei\" (Guzman TR-228), or the application of boundary line constraint semantics (Waltz TR-271), performed in a special parallel network.",
        "At \"higher\" levels of cognitive processing, however, one suspects fundamental limitations in the usefulness of parallelism.",
        "Many \"integral\" schemes were proposed in the literature on \"pattern recognition\" for parallel operations on pictorial material -- perceptrons, integral transforms, skeletonizers, and so forth.",
        "These mathematically and computationally interesting schemes might quite possibly serve as ingredients of perceptual processing theories.",
        "But as ingredients only!",
        "Basically, \"integral\" methods work only on isolated figures in two dimensions.",
        "They fail disastrously in coping with complicated, three-dimensional scenery.",
        "The new, more successful symbolic theories use hypothesis formation and confirmation methods that seem, on the surface at least, more inherently serial.",
        "It is hard to solve any very complicated problem without giving essentially full attention, at different times, to different sub-problems.",
        "Fortunately, however, beyond the brute idea of doing many things in parallel, one can imagine a more serial process that deals with large, complex, symbolic structures as units!",
