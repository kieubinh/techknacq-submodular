        "The formal result-producing style that we adopt is '(C) Copyright 1975, William C. Mann particularly crucial for two reasons first, because it ends up being the least flexible set of precedents, perhaps with the exception of basic presuppositions, and second, because it produces a strong final filtering effect on the results.",

        "Likewise, our formal approach will produce its own kind of results and inherent limitations.",
        "So, we must pay careful attention to our current style.",
        "My general attitude is that current methods can be very significantly improved, and that doing so will have a very high payoff with benefits far beyond the improvements to present and contemplated efforts.",

        "There are many problems, which may be a healthy condition, but I want to attend to just one that seems to be otherwise.",
