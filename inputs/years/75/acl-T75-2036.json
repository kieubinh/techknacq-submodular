        "The notion of a commonsense algorithm is presented as a basic ' data structure for modeling human cognition.",
        "This data structure unifies many current ideas about human memory and information processing.",
        "The structure is defined by specifying a set of proposed cognitive primitive links which, when used to build up large structures of actions, states, statechanges and tendencies, provide an adequate formalism for expressing human plans and activities, as well as general mechanisms and computer algorithms.",
        "The commonsense algorithm is a type of framework (as Minsky has defined the term) for representing algorithmic processes, hopefully the way humans do.",
        ".",
        "INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION It is becoming increasingly evident to uman intelligence model builders and heorists that, in order to characterize uman knowledge and belief as computer data tructures and processes, it is necessary to eal with very large, explicitly unified tructures rather than smaller, ununified ragments.",
        "The reason for this seems to be hat the original experiences which caused he structures and processes to exist in the irst place come in chunks themselves; nowledge is never gained outside of some ontext, and in gaining some piece of nowledge X in context C, X and C become nseparable.",
        "This suggests that it is eaningless to model \"a piece of knowledge\" ithout regard for the larger structures of hich it is a part.",
        "If our goal is to build robot which behaves and perceives in anners similar to a human, this means that he process by which the robot selects a iece of knowledge as being applicable to he planning, executory, inferential or nterpretive process at hand at the moment s a function not only of the specific roblem, but also of the larger context in 'hich that instance of planning, execution, nference or interpretation occurs.",
        "If, for xample, our robot sees his friend with a retched facial expression, the inference he takes about the reasons for his friend's lisery will reflect the larger picture of thich he is aware at the time: his friend AS just returned from a trip to purchase Tera tickets vs. his friend has just eaten he cache of mushrooms collected yesterday rs.",
        "....",
        "The same pervasiveness of context ,xists in the realm of the robot's .nterpretations of visual perceptions: the rery same object (visible at eye level) will be perceived out of the corner of his eye in one situation as the cylindrical top of his electric coffee grinder (he is at home in his kitchen), but as the flasher of a police car (he is speeding on the freeway) in another.",
        "This suggests that at every moment, some fairly large swatch of his knowledge about the world somehow has found its way to the foreground to exert its influence; as our robot moves about, swatches must fade in and out, sometimes coalescing, so that at any moment, just the right one is standing by to help guide acts of planning, inference and perception.",
        "Marvin Minsky has captured this whole idea very neatly in his widely-circulated \"Frames\" paper [M1].",
        "While this paper describes an overall approach to modeling human memory, inference and beliefs, we still lack any specific formulation of the ingredients which make up the large, explicitly-unified structures which seem to underlie many higher-level human cognitive functions.",
        "It is the purpose of this paper to define the notion \"commonsense algorithm\" (CSA) and to propose the CSA as the basic cognitive structure which underlies the human processes of planning, inference and contextual interpretation of meaning.",
        "I do not have a complete theory yet: the intent of this paper is to record a memory dump of ideas accumulated over the past few months and to show how they can unify my past ideas on inference and memory, as well as the ideas of others.",
        "II.",
        "THE SCOPE OF THE CSA'S APPLICABILITY Most of human knowledge can be classified as either static or dvaamic.",
        "For example, a person's static knowledge of an automobile tells him its general physical shape, size, position of steering wheel, wheels, engine, seats, etc.",
        "; these are the abstract aspects of a car which, although many differ in detail from car to car, are inherently unchanging.",
        "They are in essence the physical definition of a car.",
        "On the other hand, a person's dynamic knowledge of a car tells him the functions of the various components and how and why to coordinate them when the car is applied to some goal.",
        "The static knowledge tells the person where to expect the steering wheel to be when he gets in; the dynamic knowledge tells him how to get in in the first place, and what to do with the wheel (and why) once he is in.",
        "For a robot immersed in a highly kinematic world -- physically, psychologically and socially -- a very large part of his beliefs and knowledge must relate to dynamics: how he can effect changes in himself and his world, and how he perceives other robots effecting changes.",
        "It is the purpose of the CSA to capture the dynamics of the world in belief structures which are amenable to computer manipulation of plans, inference and contextual interpretation.",
        "It should be stressed that the phrase \"dynamics of the world\" is intended in its broadest possible sense.",
        "As will be elaborated upon in a later section, the",
        "phrase is intended to encompass such seemingly diverse robot/human activities as:",
        "1. communicating with another robot/human (e.g., how to transfer information, instill wants, convince, etc.)",
        "2. getting about in the world 3. building things (both physical and mental) and understanding the operation of things already built by others 4. conceiving, designing •and implementing computer programs and other commonsense algorithms (a special form of building) 5. interpreting sequences of perceptions (e.g., language utterances) in context 6. making contextually meaningful inferences from perceptions",
        "I am convinced that all such dynamics of the world can and should be expressed in a uniform CSA formalism built around a ° relatively small number of cognitively primitive ingredients.",
        "III.",
        "EVOLUTION OF THE CSA IDEA The next section will define a CSA as a network-like structure consisting of events tied together by primitive links.",
        "Taken as a whole, the CSA specifies a process: how to get something done, how something works, etc.",
        "A computer scientist's first reaction to this type of structure is \"Oh yes, that's an AND/OR problem-reduction graph\" (see Nilsson [N1] for example).",
        "Figure 1 shows an AND/OR graph for how to achieve the goal state \"a McDonald's hamburger is in P's stomach.\" Edges with an arc through them specify AND successors of a node (subgoals, all of which achieved imply the parent node has been achieved); edges with no arc through them specify OR successors (subgoals, any one of which being sufficient to achieve the parent goal).",
        "AND/OR graphs have been demonstrated adequate in practice for guiding various aspects of problem-solving behavior in existing robots (see [S1] for example).",
        "However, they are intuitively not theoretically adequate structures for representing general knowledge of world dynamics: their principal deficiency is that they are ad-hoc constructions which express neither the implicit conceptual relationships among their components, nor the inherent types of their components.",
        "Because of this, there is no constraint on their organization, and this means that two AND/OR graphs which accomplish or model the same thing might bear very little resemblance to one-another when in fact they are conceptually very similar.",
        "This may be little more than a nuisance in practice, but it is undesirable in principle because it makes learning, reasoning by analogy, sharing of subgoals, etc.",
        "tedious if not impossible in a generalized problem solver.",
        "A refinement of the notion of an AND/OR graph introduces the concepts of causality and enablement, and actions and states (statechanges); edges in the graph are distinguished as either causal or enabling, the nodes are distinguished as either actions or states, and the graph obeys the syntactic contraints:",
        "(a) actions cause states (b) states enable actions",
        "Bob Abelson [Al] was among the first to employ these historically very old concepts in the framework of a computer model of human belief, and since then, numerous computer-oriented systems of knowledge representation (e.g., Schank's conceptual.",
        "dependency[S2], Schmidt's models of personal causation [S4]), as well as systems of inference (Rieger [R1], Charniak [C1]) have found these four concepts to be vital to meaning representation and inference.",
        "In some sense, enablement, causality, states and actions seem to be cognitive primitives.",
        "Figure 2 is a refinement of Figure 1 which makes explicit the nature of each node and each connecting arc, and hence the underlying gross conceptual structure of the algorithm.",
        "While the inclusion of these four concepts (and their resulting syntactic constraints) in the basic paradigm makes for a theoretically more coherent representation, the scheme is still too coarse to capture the kinds of detailed knowledge of algorithms people possess.",
        "The following section proposes an extended framework of event types and event connectors based on these four notions and some others.",
        "These event types and connectors will be regarded as model-primitives which hopefully are in correspondence with \"psychological primitives\" in humans."

In fact, adopting the notion of a tendency as a model primitive points out a rather ubiquitous principle: humans spend a large amount of time in planning either how to overcome tendencies which stand in the way of their goals, or how to harness them at the proper times in place of an action (e.g., dropping the large rock on the coconut).",
        "Although a tendency's primary use is at the edge of the world model, where things happen simply because \"that's s the way things are\", it will probably be desirable to have the ability to regard as tendencies things which in fact can be explained.",
        "Characterizing something as a tendency even though it may be reduceable to further algorithms is probably one tactic a human employs when confronted with the analysis of very complex, olny partially understood processes.",
        "Even though something could be further explained, the system of representation should allow that something to be treated as though it were a tendency.",
        "Tendencies have numerous aspects which will require explicit characterization in a computer model.",

        "Once started, such a system is self-sustaining.",
        "In the case of fire, a one-shot causing action causes a statechange in temperature which thresholds at the point of the material's combustion temperature; this enables the tendency to burn, which in turn produces as a continual byproduct heat, causing a vicious cycle.",
