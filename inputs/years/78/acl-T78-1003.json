        "Introduction A sentence (or other portion of discourse) is taken to evoke in the listener a particular kind of experiential complex--here to be termed a \"cognitive representation\" or \"CR\".1 There appears to be a significant way in which different portions of the language input specify, or code for, different portions of the CR.",
        "The major finding is that--for a first approximation--the lexical fraction of a sentence codes mainly for the content, or substance, of a CR, while the grammatical fraction of a sentence codes mainly for the structure of a CR.",
        "Determining the structure within a realm of phenomena has been a central concern for analytic science, including linguistics and psychology.",
        "With grammar seen in the above light, it can be used in determining the structure, of the language-related portion of human cognition, with possible connections to further portions.",
        "In particular, looking_systematically at the actual notions specified by grammatical elements can give us a handle for ascertaining the very nakeup of (linguistic-) cognitive structuring.",
        "The beginnings of such an endeavor are the aims of this paper.",
        "Several ideas here require some immediate elaboration.",
        "The distinction between lexical and grammatical is made entirely formally--i.e., without any reference to meaning--on the basis of the distinction between open-class and closed-class.3 All open-class elements--i.e., the stems of nouns, verbs, and adjectives4--are considered lexical.",
        "Everything else is considered grammatical.",
        "Included here are all closed-class morphemes and words--inflections, particles, adpositons, conjunctions, demonstratives, etc.--as well as syntactic constructions, grammatical relations; categorial identities, word order, and intonation.",
        "Terminologically here, \"grammatical element\" will be used to refer to any of these.",
        "The nature of content and of structure, and the distinction between them, are not understood well enough to be addressed analytically in this paper and must be left to our intuitive sense of the matter.5 Taking them for granted, however, we can now more finely characterize the linguistic-cognitive cross-relationships noted earlier.",
        "While most of a CR's content is specified by the lexical fraction of a sentence, the lexical items do usually specify some structural notions along with the contentful ones.",
        "The grammatical elements of a sentence more unalloy-edly specify only structural notions and specify them more determinately in the case of conflict with a lexical item, establishing perhaps the majority of a CR's structure.6 In other work in the present direction--notably Fillmore's (e.g., 1975, 1976)--concern has also been with ascertaining structre, but the sentence elements used as starting-points have generally been lexical items with prominently inmixed structural specifications (like buy and sell): The present work, in part a complement to the other, takes advantage of grammar's greater directness and completeness in specifying structure.",
        "This paper is divided into three sections.",
        "In the first, a sampling of grammatical elements is examined for the notions that they specify, both as an introduction to out method and for the aim of noticing properties common to such notions as well as properties excluded from them.",
        "In the second, we present a number of the categories in which grammatically specified notions have been observed to pattern.",
        "In the third, we speculate on broader cognitve connections.",
        "1.",
        "The Nature of Grammatically Specified Notions In this section we examine a small sampling of grammatical elements for the particular component notions that they specify.",
        "The sample will give a heuristic indication of the kinds of notions that get grammatically specified as well as of kinds of notions that possibly never do.",
        "The excluded kinds will be seen as readily specifiable by lexical elements.",
        "A further comparison between the characteristics of grammatically specified notions and of lexically specified ones is then made.",
        "To indicate the major finding at the outset, it seems that grammatical specifications for structure are preponderantly relativistic or topological, and exclude the fixed or metrically Euclidean.",
        "For a first simple case, many languages have inflections for the noun (English has -rh and -s) that specify the uniplex or the multiplex instantiation of the object specified by the noun.",
        "By contrast, no languages appear to have inflections that specify the redness or blueness, etc.--i.e., the particular color--of the object specified by a noun.",
        "In the preceding, the underlined are instances of \"notions\".",
        "The first set are grammatically specified add can be readily seen to play a structuring role in a CR.7 The second set are perhaps never found specified by grammatical elements, though they are everywhere found specified by lexical elements (such as (red and blue).",
        "For another case we consider a deictic like the English this or that as in This chair is broken.",
        "A grammatical element of this type specified the location of an indicated object as being, in effect, on the speaker-side or the non-speaker-side of a conceptual partition drawn through space (or time or other qualitative dimension).",
        "This integral specification can be analyzed as containing the following component notions (enclosed by quotes): a-b.",
        "a 'partition' that divides a space into 'regions'/'sides' c-e. the 'locatedness' (a particular relation) of a 'point' (or object idealizable as a point) 'within' a region f-g. (a side that is the) 'same' as or 'different' from hi.",
        "a 'currently indicated' object and a 'currently communicating' entity Notions that might at first be ascribed to such deic-tics, such as of distance or perhaps size, prove not to be,on the evidence of sentence-pairs like (2):",
        "(2) a.",
        "This speck is smaller than that speck.",
        "b.",
        "This planet is smaller than that planet.",
        "The CRs evoked by (2a) and (b) differ greatly, involving tiny objects millimeters apart or huge objects parsecs apart.",
        "Yet the sentences differ only lexically, not grammatically.",
        "Hence, the CRs' notions as to the magnitude of size or distance cannot be traced to the deictics (or to other grammatical elements) in the sentences.",
        "Thus, the notional specifications of a this or a that appear, in part, to be genuinely topological: the establishment of a partition remains a constant, but its position can vary unlimitedly (or, using topology's characterizability as \"rubber-sheet geometry\", the partition's distance away can be stretched indefinitely) without any constraints imposed by the deictics' specifications per se.",
        "This finding about the deictics alerts us to noticing whether any grammatical elemehts make specifications about magnitude.",
        "A spot check through English and various other languages suggests that--while there are apparently grammatical specifications for relative magnitudeo--there are possibly never any for absolute or quantified magnitude, whether of size, distance, or other parameters.",
        "For a third case, we consider the type of adposition that specifies, for a moving object, certain characteristics of path and of point or frame-of-reference.",
        "An example of this type is English through as used, e.g., in:",
        "(3) a. I walked through the water.",
        "b. I walked through the timeber (i.e., woods).",
        "In this usage, through specifies, broadly, 'motion along a line that is within a medium'.",
        "The component notions contained here include:",
        "a-e. 'motion'--i.e., 'one-to-one correspondences' between 'adjacent' points of 'space' and adjacent points of 'time' f. motion that describes a 'line' g. the locatedness of a line within a 'medium' hi.",
        "a medium, i.e., a region of three-dimensional space set apart by the locatedness within it of 'material' that is in a 'pattern of dis-tribution' of a certain range of character (still to be determined) Again, with (3a) and (b) differing only lexically, any notional differences in their CRs cannot be attributed to through.",
        "Thus, not within the specificational purvue of that element are: the 'kind of substance' comprising the medium and the 'sensorimotor character-istics' attendant on executing the motion--as, here, those attendant on wading vs. weaving amidst obstacles.",
        "With other sentence pairs like",
        "(5) a/b.",
        "I crawled/ran through the timber.",
        "(6) a/b.",
        "I zig-zagged/arced throught the timber.",
        "it can be further determined that 'rate of motion' and 'shape/contour of linear path' are also not specified by the grammatical element.",
        "As one step in a program to ascertain any properties common to grammatically specified notions, the notions just found are gathered together in Table 1.",
        "For heuristic purposes, the notions are very provisionally divided into three groups on the basis of their relation to topology.",
        "In group (a) are the notions that properly belong, or are readily definable, in the actual mathematical system of topology.",
        "In group (b), the notions might not be part of topology proper but intuitively seem like those that are--and might be includable in a related mathematical system that could be constructed.",
        "In group (c) are the notions that fall outside of any usual conception of a mathematical system.",
        "The number of notions in the first two groups combined is 13, while the third has 6--an indication of a preponderant propensity for grammatical elements to specify quasi-topological notions.",
        "The ratio in this direction is in fact improved if we consider that even several notions in group (c)--the bottom three--resemble topological ones in the sense of involving relativistic relationships between quantities rather than absolutely fixed quantities.",
        "(7) Table 1: Some notions found to be specified by grammatical elements a. topological b. topology-like",
        "For a complementary program of ascertaining any properties excluded from grammatical specification, the notions found above not'to be specified by the elements investigated are listed in Table 2.",
        "Rather than topological, topology-like, or relativistic, these notions involve Euclidean-geometric concepts (e.g., set distance, size, contour), quantified measure, and various particularities of a quantity--in sum, characteristics that are absolute or fixed.",
        "(8) Table 2: Some notions seemingly never specified grammatically",
        "absolute/quantified magnitude kind of substance (of distance, size, etc.)",
        "speed shape/contour of line color sensorimotor characteristics The provisional conclusion to be drawn from these findings is that, if grammatical specifications largely correspond to (linguistic-) cognitive structuring, then the nature of that structuring is largely relativistic or topological rather than fixed or absolute.",
        "In a search for contrasts between grammatical and lexical specification, a difference that presents itself at this point is that the relativism vs. absolutism restrictions do not apply to the latter.",
        "Lexical items can specify topological and relativistic concepts, as the very words listed in Table 1 attest to.",
        "And they can also specify Euclidean or absolute concepts.",
        "Thus, for the notion of color in Table 2, there are such lexical items as red, blue; for contour, there are circle, straight; for quantified magnitude, there are inch, mile; for sensorimotor characteristics, there are wade, nimble, effort.",
        "For a further contrast between the grammatical and the lexical type of specification, we consider the full complement of both element-types in a single whole sentence, viz., that selected in (9):",
        "(9) A rustler lassoed the steers.",

        "movement sequences of materials' parts concomitant mental intentions, direc-tings, monitorings, etc.",
        "In surveying the lists, we can see these differences emerge: The grammatical elements are more numerous and their specifications seem simpler and more structural.",
        "Together, their specifications seem to determaine the main organizational and communicational delineations of the CR evoked by the sentence.",
        "The lexical elements are fewer in number, but their spec= ifications are more complex and seem to comprise most of the content of the CR.",
        "The lexical specifications are complex in three ways: compared to a grammatical specification, each has a) more total information, b) greater intricacy of information, and c) more dif,= ferent types of information together.",
        "These grammatical-lexical differences can be set into further relief by in turn varying one element-type while keeping the other constant.",
        "Thus, varying only the grammatical elements of (9), as is done in (12), seems to alter the organizational and communicational characteristics of the scene but to leave its basic contents intact: (12) Will the, rustlers lasso a steer?",

        "This category might be considered an extension or generalization of the \"disposition of a quantity\".",
        "Clearly, this category and the preceding five all belong together in treating the greater disposition Of a quantity, but the relationships have not yet all been worked out.",
        "17.",
        "Our main purpose here is to note the shift in structure type.",
        "The shift in content, which will doubtless prove to have some regulattv is not clearly understood at this point.",

        "A major function of perfect forms in language indeed appears to be the one involved here.",
        "More particularly, the perfect seems able to specify the temp oral counterpart of matter located within a bounded extent of space, as in (i).",
        "That is, a sentence containing the perfect, as in (ii), suggests a paraphrase like that in (iii), which is homologous with (i): (i) There were 5 aspirins on the table.",
        "(ii) I have taken 5 aspirins in the last hour.",
        "(iii) There were 5 aspirin-takings in the last hour.",
        "(In support of this interpretation, as pointecHout to me by Peyton Todd, the perfect can be noted always to involve a temporal span bounded at both ends.)",
        "19.",
        "All three notion--identity of a quantity, portion-taking of a quantity, configuration of the portion-are generally specified simultaneously,(or, \"conflatedly\" see Talmy (1975)) by lexical items that would fit in the A/B row of (20).",
        "For example, (a) tear specifies not only a certain shape of Quantum, but also the",
        "material involved: lachrymal fluid.",
        "Such words generally do not participate in an \"NP of NP\" construction like *a tear of milk--unless they in fact accede to a shift toward the type of word represented in drop.",
        "20.",
        "There is a foursome of apt terms that can be applied to the two levels of synthesis in the two directions of shift, as indicated in (i).",
        "Employed here is the term \"Figure\" as it is used in my other work (Talmy 1978, 1976): (i) cluster: \"composite Figure\" iceberg: \"metaFigure\" trees: \"multiple Figures\" 2 halves: \"component Figures\" 21.",
        "For the plural form oysters, the plural form siphons is ambiguous as to whether there are one or more siphons per oyster.",
        "All the other combinations unambiguously indicate the number of siphons per oyster.",
        "Thus, the exemplar form is always unambiguous in this reagard--one of its advantages over the full-complement form.",
        "This same arrangement holds through the list.",

        "I have long wondered what the differences between each and every might be.",
